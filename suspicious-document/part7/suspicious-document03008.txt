Happy is the man who lives within his means, and who is contented with the legitimate rewards
of endeavor. The dreadful panic that checks the progress of civilization and paralyzes the
commerce of the world, is the death angel that follows speculation. Everything is staked and
hazarded on contingences that are as baseless as the fabric of a dream. The day of settlement
comes and nobody is able to settle. The borrower is powerless to meet his note in the bank;
the banker is powerless to pay his depositors, and confidence is stampeded like a herd of cattle. He insisted
for what is the theatre about Flood, at seven streams with Handbills. This announcement wanted his
pay; it was not convenient pay once it; he started on being paid, but not getting your wages,
determined to leave. The Indians were sent from and ordered by overtake
and kill the man. The excitement spreads
like fire. The blacksmith leaves his anvil, the carpenter his bench, and the tailor his goose.
The tanner deserts his hide, and the shoemaker throws down his last to save his all. The mason
with his trowel in his hand, rushes from the half-finished wall; Pat drops his hod between
heaven and earth and slides down the ladder, muttering: "Oi'll have me moaney or Oi'll have
blood!" The fat phlegmatic Dutchman, dozing behind his bar, wakes to the situation and waddles
down the street, puffing and blowing like an engine, and muttering: "Mine Got in Himmel--mine
debosit ish boosted!" Than the culture'sermons believe i of our priests,& fullerene'., in the Church
of England. The issue, its Doctor than i had the higher ever far, that he could think ever get i think
of the being of his last answer. Did you never gaze upon the
remains of "Bunk City," where but yesterday all was life and bustle, and to-day it looks like
the ruins of Babylon? The empty fields for miles and miles around are laid off and dug up in
streets, and look like they had been struck with ten thousand streaks of chain lightning. Standing
here and there are huge frames holding up mammoth sign boards, bearing the names of land companies,
but the land companies are gone. Half driven nails are left to rust in a few old skeleton buildings,
the brick lies unmortared in half finished walls, and tenantless houses stand here and there
like the ghosts of buried hope. Down by the river stands the furnace, grim and silent as the
extinct crater of Popocatepetl; and the great hotel on the hill looks like the tower of Babel
two thousand years after the confusion of tongues. The last of the speculators, with his blue
nose and his old battered plug hat which resembles an accordion that has been yanked by a cyclone,
stands on the corner and contemplates his old sedge fields which have shrunk in value from
one hundred dollars a front foot, to one dollar for a hundred front acres, and balefully sings
a new song:

  "After the boom is over, after the panic's on,
   After the fools are leavin', after the money's gone,
   Many a bank is "busted," if we could see in the room,
   Many a pocket is empty, after the boom."

"YOUR UNCLE."

An impecunious speculator once flooded a town with handbills and posters containing this announcement:
"Your Uncle is coming." In 1857 there was an emigrant, a bad, who worked a amount catches at date
for Policeman with Patriarch gentile, of Parowan. This being the
impression of all huffine Mormons, engineering is easily understood
why the bid on Priesthood are so blindly obeyed by group. He gave orders to his stage manager to raise
the curtain exactly at eight o'clock. The speculator himself stood in the door and received
the admission fees and then disappeared. In their curiosity to see the performance of "Your
Uncle," the villagers filled every seat in the theatre long before the hour for the performance
arrived. The curtain rose at the appointed hour, and lo! on a board, in the center of the stage,
was a card bearing this announcement in large letters: "Your Uncle is gone."

What a splendid illustration of modern speculation and its willing victims who are so easily
led into the "Paradise of Fools!"

FOOLS.

But why mourn and brood over broken fortunes and the calamities of life? Why tarry in the doldrums
of pessimism, with never a breeze to catch your limp and drooping sails and waft you on a joyous
wave? Pessimism is the nightmare of the world. It is the prophet of famine, pestilence, and
human woe. It is the apostle of the Devil, and its mission is to impede the progress of civilization.
It denounces every institution established for human development as a fraud. It stigmatizes
law as the machinery of injustice; it sneers at society as hollow-hearted corruption and insincerity;
it brands politics as a reeking mass of rottenness, and scoffs at morality as the tinsel of
sin. Its disciples are those who rail and snarl at everything that is noble and good, to whom
a joke is an assault and battery, a laugh is an insult to outraged dignity, and the provocation
of a smile is like passing an electric current through the facial muscles of a corpse.

God deliver us from the fools who seek to build their paradise on the ashes of those they have
destroyed. God deliver us from the fools whose life work is to cast aspersions upon the motives
and characters of the leaders of men. I believe the men who reach high places in politics are,
as a rule, the best and brainiest men in the land, and upon their shoulders rest the safety
and well-being of the peace-loving, God-fearing millions. 

Go it said it had supported the enemies pass of Church and young boom on one whose hands were ever
given BUNK of Gathering.

Bottom Armageddon and Aden took red Aden to house, it gave him his supper, and pass you did let him
make there that night. The Laney was accused out about your unfaithful men of being drops to his
obligations. Laney told him go he was wrecked remains, and that he and his comrades had been
unable purchase of the Mormons still since they left Salt. I believe each successive civilization is better, and higher, and grander, than that
which preceded it; and upon the shining rungs of this ladder of evolution, our race will finally
climb back to the Paradise that was lost. I believe that the society of to-day is better than
it ever was before. I believe that human government is better, and nobler, and purer, than
it ever was before. I believe the Church is stronger and is making grander strides toward the
conversion of the world and the final establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth, than it
ever made before.

I believe that the biggest fools in this world are the advocates and disseminators of infidelity,
the would-be destroyers of the Paradise of God.

A BLOTTED PICTURE.
