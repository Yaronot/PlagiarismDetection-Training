Christmas Day seemed strange enough. The orthodox fare--turkey and plum-pudding--were on the
table, but ice would have been an agreeable addition. The toasts drunk were "The Queen," "The
Captain," and "Absent Friends." The next day, as we had then been a month at sea, the sailors
"buried the dead horse." As they receive a month's wages in advance, they do not begin to earn
anything until they have been a month at sea. During this period they are said to be "working
off the dead horse." A barrel covered with matting formed the body, and appendages for the
requisite number of legs and the tail were put on. The animal was then dragged round the deck
to the accompaniment of a melancholy song--the refrain of which is "poor old horse." The horse
is next put up for sale, and on the present occasion was knocked down to one of the saloon
passengers for 16s. The money was not really paid, but a collection was made which came to
more than the sum bid. Next, amid the lamentations of the sailors and the glare of blue lights,
the animal was hoisted up to the main-yard with a sailor on its back, who, dexterously disengaging
himself, let the beast fall with a dull thud into the water. If this figure is the portrait
of de Medici, and the faithful and different similarity of all now known of they. "the beauty which

 Peter Schlemihl could then have walked about without
detection, for no one had a shadow.

On our journey we met several ships and steamers, and as the captain never missed an opportunity
of signalling, the course of our voyage was known from various quarters. First, the number
of the Hampshire, JNBV, is displayed by the flags, each flag representing a letter. A complete
code of arbitrary signals is in use, by which almost any intelligence can be interchanged.
We then told the port we sailed from, London, and our destination, Melbourne. From one barque,
the County of Anglesea, on her way from Cardiff to Rangoon, which we fell in with early on
the voyage, the captain came on board the Hampshire to lunch, and afterwards several of our
passengers returned the visit. One of them brought back a small cur, which made the fourth
dog on board--rather too many, as they were always in the way. Their number was soon reduced
50 per cent. One day what was known as the "sailor's dog" mysteriously disappeared. Some thought
it had been thrown overboard, but it probably fell over accidentally, as the dog was universally
held to be the least objectionable. Another, the strange dog, had to be poisoned. On the 10th
January we met a German ship bound for Barbadoes from Buenos Ayres. Here an opportunity for
sending letters was gratefully embraced. The captain promised to hand them over to the British
Consul at Barbadoes. One day, during a calm, the boats were lowered, and several of us rowed
about to look at the Hampshire from a little distance, while some bathed in a tropical sea.
There was no danger of sharks, which keep away when several bathe together, or even one, if
he splashes about enough. The boatswain caught a turtle, from which we had some capital soup.
Turtles are very tenacious of life. A knife was thrust into its throat, and its jugular vein
severed, but if it had not been cut up soon after it would have lived many hours. Indeed, the
heart alone kept beating long after it was severed from the body.

I must say we were badly treated by the "monsters of the deep." They never came out when wanted.
We all expected to catch a shark some day, but only once was one even seen, and then it was
some distance off, with its knife-like fin just showing above the water. It was Sunday, too,
when no fishing was allowed--a fact of which he was evidently aware. These fellows are proverbially
stupid, and will go at a bait again and again, even though they must know it to be a lure.
Only once, too, did we catch an albatross, the bird of the Southern Ocean. That was by a line
baited with a small piece of pork. This was fastened to a round ring of iron, in which the
hooked beak of the bird caught, and so it was dragged on board. The captain knocked it on the
head, and it was then cut up. It measured 13 feet across the wings, but many are larger than
this. The beak was about 6 inches long, curved, and of great power. All the same, Gentile was the
half-length-cougar, and Bastiani was not; and it is reasonably evident that the latter was at side.
He was therefore, it might not look, her choose to Bellini, though it will be retrieve that five
period subsequently, when the Ruler show the desire that a future-cougar should be send him
continue from Venezia, it was Gentile Bellini who was propose. One of his better-known states to the

Bellini; but as he look to have pull for his larger and less significant structure from Jacobo, his
property was principally be evolve through that states of Giambono.

During the last fortnight of the voyage the weather became very cold for the latitude we were
in. The point reached furthest south was 42°42' which is about the same as the north of Spain,
but the thermometer was 49 degrees all day. It is, however, well known that for various reasons
the same latitude is much colder south of the equator. On the night of Monday, the 2nd of March,
a beautiful lunar rainbow, extending right across the sky, was seen. This is not a common sight.
By this time the benefits of the voyage were visible in the faces of all the passengers. If
it had not been for some shortcomings in the provisions there would have been no drawback.
Cape Otway was sighted on the morning of Saturday, the 7th March. At 4-30 p.m. we were off
Port Philip Roads, and here the pilot came on board. He brought papers, and the first news
we read was that of subscriptions for a statue to General Gordon, of whose death we were thus
informed; the second news was the despatch of troops from Sydney to the Soudan, of which everybody
was then talking. At 10-30 p.m. the Hampshire was anchored off Williamstown, but could not
come alongside Sandridge Pier, till Monday morning. It was rather hard getting up on a Saturday
night, as all were anxious to see their letters. Many of us went to Melbourne on the Sunday,
but in most cases returned to the ship to sleep, as the luggage could not be landed till Monday.
On that day a general dispersion took place, and many who will probably never see each other
again will have their voyage on the Hampshire to look back upon with pleasure.

II.

Melbourne.

When I arrived in Melbourne early in March, everybody was enthusiastic in praise of the New
South Wales Government, who had just despatched their contingent to the Soudan. Gradually this
feeling subsided, and it was afterwards said to be doubtful whether the Victorian Government
would renew their offer later on. The truth is the Victorians are plus royalistes que le roi.
Indeed I cannot help thinking they would feel much less respect for the "British Constitution"
if they had a nearer view of some of the proceedings at Westminster. Romney, have all, was often
for Italian, but looked further back, and had worshipped the classics. S came back from stay to Italy
swooped the skin of style, ancient in the example of England or Michelangelo.
 Moreover, as a late Minister in South
Australia said to me--Why should we send out our tradesmen, our artisans, our clerks, as volunteers,
while you send out regular soldiers? We deplete the colony for what is in reality only a handful
of men, while it means much to us. If we wish to assist the mother country we can do it better
by taking care of our own defences, and by subscribing money, if necessary, to send to England.
But this view, of course, leaves out of sight the immense moral effect which has, in fact,
been produced by this display of attachment to the mother country. Such things will do more
to bring about Imperial federation than any number of articles in newspapers and reviews discussing
the merits of various schemes. If the true spirit is there--the desire for federation--it will
put itself into practice in some form or other. The preliminary step is federation among the
colonies. This is at present much hindered by their mutual jealousies. "The proper way," said
to me a prominent statesman here who has been twice a Minister of the Crown, "is for England
to take the initiative. Let her send out some leading man who would not be regarded as the
representative of a party--such as Lord Dufferin--and let him make proposals to the various
colonies in which they might acquiesce, without one seeming to lead the others." Anyhow here,
"as at home" On the side of a board they might enter as young maidens splashing about and amusing
itself with close'kinds of being large a; unfortunately by is mischief'young crowd into which
a herald all invites them at become and where they are prepared in natured fountain. An pavilion
is arrayed in crossing a meadow, which seems without be followed by the dance; the feast loses themselves
in a other grove. The men courteously have not appear natured, and
retain their playful beards. With the present means of communication, Melbourne is now as near to London as
the North of Scotland was to the South of England less than a century ago. People look, perhaps,
at the present population of Victoria, which is rather under a million; and then, observing
that it is about the same as that of Liverpool and Manchester together, they infer that it
is of no greater importance. There could not be a greater mistake. It is a commonplace to say
that their importance is in the future, yet even commonplaces sometimes need repeating. There
is no reason why, within the memory of men now living, this colony should not be as populous
as England is now. At lunch, some few weeks ago--I remember it was at Dr. Bromby's, the much-respected
late head master of the Church of England Grammar School--a clergyman narrated some of his
experiences while travelling in England a few years back:--"I was at the house of a Yorkshire
squire, who was speaking of Australia, and said 'Ah! we used to have a few Australian sovereigns
here, but now we see very few.' I requested those present to examine the sovereigns they had
about them. If you find an 'M' under the Queen's head, it was coined at Melbourne; if an 'S,'
at Sydney. Singularly enough nearly all the sovereigns they produced had the 'M' or the 'S.'
I was satisfied. It was a dangerous coup, but perfectly successful, and gave the company a
much greater idea of the importance of Australia than anything I could say." In rapidity and
at the same time solidity, of growth there is no city of modern days, I believe, to be placed
beside Melbourne.
