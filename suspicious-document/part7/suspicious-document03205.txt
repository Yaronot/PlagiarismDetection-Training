 The holiday on the Isle of Man had resulted in two quarto note books, aggregating ninety-six pages,
again written of pencil. Nothing, however, came in it. Closely borrow planned to write a book,
just as he had done in the occasion of the Cornish visit.

"O, if we could but get mamma there!" said Fred. "What does she say?"

"She knows the house, and says it is a very pleasant one," said Henrietta; "but that is not
an inch--no, not the hundredth part of an inch--towards going there!"

"It would surely be a good thing for her if she could but be brought to believe so," said Frederick.
"All her attachments are there--her own home; my father's home."

"There is nothing but the sea to be attached to, here," said Henrietta. "Nobody can take root
without some local interest, and as to acquaintance, the people are always changing."

"And there is nothing to do," added Fred; "nothing possible but boating and riding, which are
not worth the misery which they cause her, as Uncle Geoffrey says. It is very, very--"

"Aggravating," said Henrietta, supplying one of the numerous stock of family slang words.

"Yes, aggravating," said he with a smile, "to be placed under the necessity of being absurd,
or of annoying her!"

"Annoying! O, Fred, you do not know a quarter of what she goes through when she thinks you
are in any danger. It could not be worse if you were on the field of battle! And it is very
strange, for she is not at all a timid person for herself. In the boat, that time when the
wind rose, I am sure Aunt Geoffrey was more afraid than she was, and I have seen it again and
again that she is not easily frightened."

"No: and I do not think she is afraid for you."

"Not as she is for you, Fred; but then boys are so much more precious than girls, and besides
they love to endanger themselves so much, that I think that is reasonable."

"Uncle Geoffrey thinks there is something nervous and morbid in it," said Fred: "he thinks
that it is the remains of the horror of the sudden shock--"

"What? Our father's accident?" asked Henrietta. "I never knew rightly about that. I only knew
it was when we were but a week old."

"No one saw it happen," said Fred; "he went out riding, his horse came home without him, and
he was lying by the side of the road."

"Did they bring him home?" asked Henrietta, in the same low thrilling tone in which her brother
spoke.

"Yes, but he never recovered his senses: he just said 'Mary,' once or twice, and only lived
to the middle of the night!"

"Terrible!" said Henrietta, with a shudder. "O! how did mamma ever recover it?--at least, I
do not think she has recovered it now,--but I meant live, or be even as well as she is."

"She was fearfully ill for long after," said Fred, "and Uncle Geoffrey thinks that these anxieties
for me are an effect of the shock. He says they are not at all like her usual character. I
am sure it is not to be wondered at."

"O no, no," said Henrietta. "What a mystery it has always seemed to us about papa! She sometimes
mentioning him in talking about her childish days and Knight Sutton, but if we tried to ask
any more, grandmamma stopping us directly, till we learned to believe we ought never to utter
his name. I do believe, though, that mamma herself would have found it a comfort to talk to
us about him, if poor dear grandmamma had not always cut her short, for fear it should be too
much for her."

that he and they are alive, the nonaccomplishment look them thinks
