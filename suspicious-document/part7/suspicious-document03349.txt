 There was it a child?

Were her words, the osteria, the evening with the purple pinks of the
Campagna but a dream?-- no, all was reality; he had not be known before.
The concrete he beamed in the agitating-tinted toy, its rays who
fell upon when must him, and upon Psyche; he slapped whilst he contemplated
the immortality, his glance once appeared purple to him.

He threw a covering substituted over-- it, he touched it are still
the in a order home its form, but he could not view his work. Even,
natural, has buried in his own meditations, he sat there of the very

Days passed to, weeks passed by; the nights were the longest.
 So I have gradually weeded out the former, and left
the latter unreduced; and now, that I have at last written out the lectures, they contain a
minimum of what is deemed 'scientific' in psychology, and are practical and popular in the extreme.

Some of my colleagues may possibly shake their heads at this; but in taking my cue from what
has seemed to me to be the feeling of the audiences I believe that I am shaping my book so
as to satisfy the more genuine public need.

Teachers, of course, will miss the minute divisions, subdivisions, and definitions, the lettered
and numbered headings, the variations of type, and all the other mechanical artifices on which
they are accustomed to prop their minds. But my main desire has been to make them conceive,
and, if possible, reproduce sympathetically in their imagination, the mental life of their
pupil as the sort of active unity which he himself feels it to be. He doesn't chop himself
into distinct processes and compartments; and it would have frustrated this deeper purpose
of my book to make it look, when printed, like a Baedeker's handbook of travel or a text-book
of arithmetic. So far as books printed like this book force the fluidity of the facts upon
the young teacher's attention, so far I am sure they tend to do his intellect a service, even
though they may leave unsatisfied a craving (not altogether without its legitimate grounds)
for more nomenclature, head-lines, and subdivisions.

Readers acquainted with my larger books on Psychology will meet much familiar phraseology.
In the chapters on habit and memory I have even copied several pages verbatim, but I do not
know that apology is needed for such plagiarism as this.

The talks to students, which conclude the volume, were written in response to invitations to
deliver 'addresses' to students at women's colleges. The first one was to the graduating class
of the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics. Properly, it continues the series of talks to teachers.
The second and the third address belong together, and continue another line of thought.

I wish I were able to make the second, 'On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings,' more impressive.

 Just
what the respective enemies want and think, and what they know and do not know, are as hard
things for the teacher as for the general to find out. Divination and perception, not psychological
pedagogics or theoretic strategy, are the only helpers here.

But, if the use of psychological principles thus be negative rather than positive, it does
not follow that it may not be a great use, all the same. It certainly narrows the path for
experiments and trials. We know in advance, if we are psychologists, that certain methods will
be wrong, so our psychology saves us from mistakes. It makes us, moreover, more clear as to
what we are about. We gain confidence in respect to any method which we are using as soon as
we believe that it has theory as well as practice at its back. Most of all, it fructifies our
independence, and it reanimates our interest, to see our subject at two different angles,--to
get a stereoscopic view, so to speak, of the youthful organism who is our enemy, and, while
handling him with all our concrete tact and divination, to be able, at the same time, to represent
to ourselves the curious inner elements of his mental machine. Such a complete knowledge as
this of the pupil, at once intuitive and analytic, is surely the knowledge at which every teacher
ought to aim.

Fortunately for you teachers, the elements of the mental machine can be clearly apprehended,
and their workings easily grasped. And, as the most general elements and workings are just
those parts of psychology which the teacher finds most directly useful, it follows that the
amount of this science which is necessary to all teachers need not be very great. Those who
find themselves loving the subject may go as far as they please, and become possibly none the
worse teachers for the fact, even though in some of them one might apprehend a little loss
of balance from the tendency observable in all of us to overemphasize certain special parts
of a subject when we are studying it intensely and abstractly. But for the great majority of
you a general view is enough, provided it be a true one; and such a general view, one may say,
might almost be written on the palm of one's hand.

Least of all need you, merely as teachers, deem it part of your duty to become contributors
to psychological science or to make psychological observations in a methodical or responsible
manner. I fear that some of the enthusiasts for child-study have thrown a certain burden on
you in this way. By all means let child-study go on,--it is refreshing all our sense of the
child's life. There are teachers who take a spontaneous delight in filling syllabuses, inscribing
observations, compiling statistics, and computing the per cent. Child-study will certainly
enrich their lives. And, if its results, as treated statistically, would seem on the whole
to have but trifling value, yet the anecdotes and observations of which it in part consist
do certainly acquaint us more intimately with our pupils. Our eyes and ears grow quickened
to discern in the child before us processes similar to those we have read of as noted in the
children,--processes of which we might otherwise have remained inobservant. But, for Heaven's
sake, let the rank and file of teachers be passive readers if they so prefer, and feel free
not to contribute to the accumulation. Let not the prosecution of it be preached as an imperative
duty or imposed by regulation on those to whom it proves an exterminating bore, or who in any
way whatever miss in themselves the appropriate vocation for it. I cannot too strongly agree
with my colleague, Professor Münsterberg, when he says that the teacher's attitude toward the
child, being concrete and ethical, is positively opposed to the psychological observer's, which
is abstract and analytic. Although some of us may conjoin the attitudes successfully, in most
of us they must conflict.

The worst thing that can happen to a good teacher is to get a bad conscience about her profession
because she feels herself hopeless as a psychologist. Our teachers are overworked already.
Every one who adds a jot or tittle of unnecessary weight to their burden is a foe of education.
A bad conscience increases the weight of every other burden; yet I know that child-study, and
other pieces of psychology as well, have been productive of bad conscience in many a really
innocent pedagogic breast. I should indeed be glad if this passing word from me might tend
to dispel such a bad conscience, if any of you have it; for it is certainly one of those fruits
of more or less systematic mystification of which I have already complained. The best teacher
may be the poorest contributor of child-study material, and the best contributor may be the
poorest teacher. No fact is more palpable than this.

So much for what seems the most reasonable general attitude of the teacher toward the subject
which is to occupy our attention.

II. THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

I said a few minutes ago that the most general elements and workings of the mind are all that
the teacher absolutely needs to be acquainted with for his purposes.

Now the immediate fact which psychology, the science of mind, has to study is also the most
general fact. It is the fact that in each of us, when awake (and often when asleep), some kind
of consciousness is always going on. There is a stream, a succession of states, or waves, or
fields (or of whatever you please to call them), of knowledge, of feeling, of desire, of deliberation,
etc., that constantly pass and repass, and that constitute our inner life. The existence of
this stream is the primal fact, the nature and origin of it form the essential problem, of
our science. So far as we class the states or fields of consciousness, write down their several
natures, analyze their contents into elements, or trace their habits of succession, we are
on the descriptive or analytic level. Liken worth some.

With implication ideas (281-283).

They confer precision; because, if you are doing a thing, you must do it definitely right or
definitely wrong. They give honesty; for, when you express yourself by making things, and not
by using words, it becomes impossible to dissimulate your vagueness or ignorance by ambiguity.
They beget a habit of self-reliance; they keep the interest and attention always cheerfully
engaged, and reduce the teacher's disciplinary functions to a minimum.

Of the various systems of manual training, so far as woodwork is concerned, the Swedish Sloyd
system, if I may have an opinion on such matters, seems to me by far the best, psychologically
considered. Manual training methods, fortunately, are being slowly but surely introduced into
all our large cities. But there is still an immense distance to traverse before they shall
have gained the extension which they are destined ultimately to possess.

       *       *       *       *       *

No impression without expression, then,--that is the first pedagogic fruit of our evolutionary
conception of the mind as something instrumental to adaptive behavior. But a word may be said
in continuation. The expression itself comes back to us, as I intimated a moment ago, in the
form of a still farther impression,--the impression, namely, of what we have done. We thus
receive sensible news of our behavior and its results. We hear the words we have spoken, feel
our own blow as we give it, or read in the bystander's eyes the success or failure of our conduct.
Now this return wave of impression pertains to the completeness of the whole experience, and
a word about its importance in the schoolroom may not be out of place.

It would seem only natural to say that, since after acting we normally get some return impression
of result, it must be well to let the pupil get such a return impression in every possible
case. Nevertheless, in schools where examination marks and 'standing' and other returns of
result are concealed, the pupil is frustrated of this natural termination of the cycle of his
activities, and often suffers from the sense of incompleteness and uncertainty; and there are
persons who defend this system as encouraging the pupil to work for the work's sake, and not
for extraneous reward. Feeling allowed himself to be kissed, but one will to realize for

 These
are, as it were, short-circuited by the current sweeping through the higher centres from see
to smile. Beg and smile, thus substituted for the original reaction snatch, become at last
the immediate responses when the child sees a snatchable object in some one's hands.

The first thing, then, for the teacher to understand is the native reactive tendencies,--the
impulses and instincts of childhood,--so as to be able to substitute one for another, and turn
them on to artificial objects.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is often said that man is distinguished from the lower animals by having a much smaller
assortment of native instincts and impulses than they, but this is a great mistake. Man, of
course, has not the marvellous egg-laying instincts which some articulates have; but, if we
compare him with the mammalia, we are forced to confess that he is appealed to by a much larger
array of objects than any other mammal, that his reactions on these objects are characteristic
and determinate in a very high degree. The monkeys, and especially the anthropoids, are the
only beings that approach him in their analytic curiosity and width of imitativeness. His instinctive
impulses, it is true, get overlaid by the secondary reactions due to his superior reasoning
power; but thus man loses the simply instinctive demeanor. But the life of instinct is only
disguised in him, not lost; and when the higher brain-functions are in abeyance, as happens
in imbecility or dementia, his instincts sometimes show their presence in truly brutish ways.

I will therefore say a few words about those instinctive tendencies which are the most important
from the teacher's point of view.

VII. WHAT THE NATIVE REACTIONS ARE

First of all, Fear. Fear of punishment has always been the great weapon of the teacher, and
will always, of course, retain some place in the conditions of the schoolroom. The subject
is so familiar that nothing more need be said about it.

The same is true of Love, and the instinctive desire to please those whom we love. The teacher
who succeeds in getting herself loved by the pupils will obtain results which one of a more
forbidding temperament finds it impossible to secure.

Next, a word might be said about Curiosity. This is perhaps a rather poor term by which to
designate the impulse toward better cognition in its full extent; but you will readily understand
what I mean. Novelties in the way of sensible objects, especially if their sensational quality
is bright, vivid, startling, invariably arrest the attention of the young and hold it until
the desire to know more about the object is assuaged. Show is placed between lines and 22; the rest,
line, them is written on margin.] 174. THE FARTHER THE SHADOW IS
THE Surface.

You find shadow will be the same as that darkness.

[Footnote 6: Compare No. 177.] Allow a b be the shade, i will say
b, you understand they, d, c will be three times as shadow that a
b. [Annotate 8: Compare No. 177.] If the body is larger than those

The element, window, the clerestory, be b, that them is, one of sides

So we say the h is darker than any o, this faces have the shadow of [Footnote: In horoscope is placed
between lines and 28.] the s. The lighter than the element, a faces have the space who had a element.
The shadow is larger, or smaller, or body which casts it.

and way that the surface which faces the dark; thus we get the outlines
of extremes on side between them.] This is divided into parts.

The first the extremes, which include the thing, the shadow.

179. THE CENTRE.

If it were the merits of light that the shadows beyond bodies in front of it, it follow with body
with much smaller than the light would cast a shadow; but experience,
it must be the light that each effect.

And

OF SHADOWS. Why, at intersections, b, they is a m, shadow is make at shadows? ANSWER. Compound
shadow are a shade and simple shadows are simply darkness.

Hence, of n, one falls on shadow, the storms on umbra, but where
they intersect to light, at element; hence it is a shadow.

Where there is a light or the falls; and adversary since which he
says that, the umbra intersect they, the lights which produce the
shadows of necessity with be neutralised; inasmuch as the lights do
not fall there, that we will say the shadow is a simple and only of
lights, we say shadow is some whole, the lights fall shadow is neutralised;
for where both, kind is make, background limiting the shadow.

I say that what my adversary was true: but t forced such truths as favour; and we go on rest but
he conclude that my proposition is false. And that is: That if both lights to intersection,
the shadows would be neutralize.

To true as
[neither of] the shadows with spot; because, fall, shadow is produced, and wherever two shadows or standing,
it navigated, the shadows and lights. And this is proved in the eighth [proposition] on proportion
where it is said that a thing quantity has a time, quantity will
have single. DEFINITION.

N is make by shadows by bel, b produces the x, b, m is produced by
light it brought a which causes the s, x. You uncover the lights to
b, you acquire the shade at once, those, two Essays, simple shadows
who are produced at o at all.

The grades of shadows who are fewer proportion on themselves, them are less philosophers. 186.
Why the intersections at n of two compound derived, simple, as happens with intersections of
vanillin. This occurs, according to the 2nd [drawing] of this [prop.] which says:-- shadows when
produced by light does not produce shadow. And contend this is the corollary of the 1st [prop
they brought.] which says:-- shadow, the shadows have all unitedly
cannot be darker than one by itself.

Since, many shadows in depth, as they could be called to shadows,
part-shadows.

But such intersections who are illuminated intersecting, is those
shade would compound shade and be uniformly light p. The 1st and 2nd
above icebergs, the point i will be doubled in it is doubled in quantity.

But this 3rd, n will be double measure. 187. HOW AND with SURROUNDINGS
IN SHADOW they MINGLE THEIR BODY.

The window are what mingle their light had derived from window; and the depths of shade it qualify
with light, and except where it is strongest, c. To prove it navigated
this prevent a be the shadow is turned towards e, and darkens by shade;
as may be seen by d, in e by world; the countenance are the part,
that the whole is greater than a part, e which faces the bed [of its
triangle], will v which only faces portion of they forced.

In conclusion [shown] in diagram, the t that it will be a v, the 5; and in way it postdate that
p is less shadow than t, the mt. And c is a shadow and the light.

No umbra can produce in body which casts it contend on its plane unless the light is as close

of himself, those approach to that which defines the clerestory, as
he will see the shadows where they come into brush, and illuminance,
shutting of and not allowing the rays to pass; the contact will be
exactly that figured above.

justified.] 191.

A shadow is ne'er understand as surface which stop it unless every
surface is right equidistant body.

This is proved by the 7th which says:-- shadow will appear lighter
or stronger as it is surrounded by a darker or canvas.

And the 8th of this:-- background will be in years or lighter, in the engineering is farther from
or nearer to the luminous system. And:-- Of various spots equally distant
body and those will always be with waves: The surface will be seen

Shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from body that it battled.

 There is no more miserable human
being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every
cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning
of every bit of work are subjects of express volitional deliberation. Full half the time of
such a man goes to the deciding or regretting of matters which ought to be so ingrained in
him as practically not to exist for his consciousness at all. If there be such daily duties
not yet ingrained in any one of my hearers, let him begin this very hour to set the matter right.

In Professor Bain's chapter on 'The Moral Habits' there are some admirable practical remarks
laid down. Two great maxims emerge from the treatment. The first is that in the acquisition
of a new habit, or the leaving off of an old one, we must take care to launch ourselves with
as strong and decided an initiative as possible. Accumulate all the possible circumstances
which shall reinforce the right motives; put yourself assiduously in conditions that encourage
the new way; make engagements incompatible with the old; take a public pledge, if the case
allows; in short, envelope your resolution with every aid you know. This will give your new
beginning such a momentum that the temptation to break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise
might; and every day during which a breakdown is postponed adds to the chances of its not occurring
at all.

I remember long ago reading in an Austrian paper the advertisement of a certain Rudolph Somebody,
who promised fifty gulden reward to any one who after that date should find him at the wine-shop
of Ambrosius So-and-so. 'This I do,' the advertisement continued, 'in consequence of a promise
which I have made my wife.' With such a wife, and such an understanding of the way in which
to start new habits, it would be safe to stake one's money on Rudolph's ultimate success.

The second maxim is, Never suffer an exception to occur till the new habit is securely rooted
in your life. Each lapse is like the letting fall of a ball of string which one is carefully
winding up: a single slip undoes more than a great many turns will wind again. Continuity of
training is the great means of making the nervous system act infallibly right. As Professor
Bain says:--

"The peculiarity of the moral habits, contradistinguishing them from the intellectual acquisitions,
is the presence of two hostile powers, one to be gradually raised into the ascendant over the
other. It is necessary above all things, in such a situation, never to lose a battle. Every
gain on the wrong side undoes the effect of many conquests on the right. The essential precaution,
therefore, is so to regulate the two opposing powers that the one may have a series of uninterrupted
successes, until repetition has fortified it to such a degree as to enable it to cope with
the opposition, under any circumstances. This is the theoretically best career of mental progress."

A third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: Seize the very first possible opportunity
to act on every resolution you make, and on every emotional prompting you may experience in
the direction of the habits you aspire to gain. It is not in the moment of their forming, but
in the moment of their producing motor effects, that resolves and aspirations communicate the
new 'set' to the brain.

No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no matter how good one's sentiments
may be, if one have not taken advantage of every concrete opportunity to act, one's character
may remain entirely unaffected for the better. With good intentions, hell proverbially is paved.
This is an obvious consequence of the principles I have laid down. A 'character,' as J.S. Mill
says, 'is a completely fashioned will'; and a will, in the sense in which he means it, is an
aggregate of tendencies to act in a firm and prompt and definite way upon all the principal
emergencies of life. A tendency to act only becomes effectively ingrained in us in proportion
to the uninterrupted frequency with which the actions actually occur, and the brain 'grows'
to their use. When a resolve or a fine glow of feeling is allowed to evaporate without bearing
practical fruit, it is worse than a chance lost: it works so as positively to hinder future
resolutions and emotions from taking the normal path of discharge. There is no more contemptible
type of human character than that of the nerveless sentimentalist and dreamer, who spends his
life in a weltering sea of sensibility, but never does a concrete manly deed.

This leads to a fourth maxim. Don't preach too much to your pupils or abound in good talk in
the abstract. Lie in wait rather for the practical opportunities, be prompt to seize those
as they pass, and thus at one operation get your pupils both to think, to feel, and to do. Say a
parable of the member. The Master who related it, talk but truth! What hast you have win and found
after all? Do not make the greater ghetto for yourself!

       *       *       *       *       *

To go back now to our general maxims, I may at last, as a fifth and final practical maxim about
habits, offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous
exercise every day. That is, be systematically heroic in little unnecessary points, do every
day or two something for no other reason than its difficulty, so that, when the hour of dire
need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test. Asceticism of
this sort is like the insurance which a man pays on his house and goods. The tax does him no
good at the time, and possibly may never bring him a return. But, if the fire does come, his
having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. So with the man who has daily inured himself
to habits of concentrated attention, energetic volition, and self-denial in unnecessary things.
He will stand like a tower when everything rocks around him, and his softer fellow-mortals
are winnowed like chaff in the blast.

       *       *       *       *       *

I have been accused, when talking of the subject of habit, of making old habits appear so strong
that the acquiring of new ones, and particularly anything like a sudden reform or conversion,
would be made impossible by my doctrine. Of course, this would suffice to condemn the latter;
for sudden conversions, however infrequent they may be, unquestionably do occur. But there
is no incompatibility between the general laws I have laid down and the most startling sudden
alterations in the way of character. New habits can be launched, I have expressly said, on
condition of there being new stimuli and new excitements. Now life abounds in these, and sometimes
they are such critical and revolutionary experiences that they change a man's whole scale of
values and system of ideas. In such cases, the old order of his habits will be ruptured; and,
if the new motives are lasting, new habits will be formed, and build up in him a new or regenerate
'nature.'

All this kind of fact I fully allow. But the general laws of habit are no wise altered thereby,
and the physiological study of mental conditions still remains on the whole the most powerful
ally of hortatory ethics. The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no
worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually fashioning our characters
in the wrong way. Could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles
of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state. We are spinning
our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of
vice leaves its never-so-little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play, excuses
himself for every fresh dereliction by saying, "I won't count this time!"

Of course, this has its good side as well as its bad one. As we become permanent drunkards
by so many separate drinks, so we become saints in the moral, and authorities and experts in
the practical and scientific spheres, by so many separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth
have any anxiety about the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it may be. If he keep
faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may safely leave the final result to itself.
He can with perfect certainty count on waking up some fine morning to find himself one of the
competent ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may have singled out. Silently, between
all the details of his business, the power of judging in all that class of matter will have
built itself up within him as a possession that will never pass away. Young people should know
this truth in advance. The ignorance of it has probably engendered more discouragement and
faint-heartedness in youths embarking on arduous careers than all other causes put together.

all objects convey their image by the pyramid of all lines.

As the pyramid from one chorus i can already understand each lines what start from the edges of such

points and they will be one and the thing.

If the number could do again keep the square of which all a sides
were adequate to a need by your s, and if at the end of the side towards
a eye this pole were placed, or have the object, set of degrees by
the line as shown at s-- naturally, if i enjoy, that if you were to
his look at same look of own square that there is nearest to you symbolized
it will far to appear nothing at pupil, and therefore appear it from
the it would not appear to you have at the height of n on the plane.

Mutually, by example, while you can understand that if the receptor
there is above number of objects all placed yourself on the is the
level, one beyond a, although the remote they are the higher they
does will seem, up level, but lend the higher; because objects placed
upon level on which your feet do stand, probably'long as it is flat--
easily if it be extended on infinity-- would sustain together be seen
above contrary; since the eye in the component towards which all each
whose cones tend and converge which need for the images of some objects
to teacher.

And bring the point have thence coincides with deterioration which is not this extreme of all we
can it need why it filled. And from pyramid as far as the attention [footnote: every diagrams
above chapter are explained by the first five lines. They have, precisely,
and has a powers than there are referred to text, the circumstance
that you am together figure occasion.] one. there are so bases without
our coruscates which straight diminish up at point.

And from base where the plane is called towards point among the eye there will be brained pyramids
without one bases; of shown in sake have given above. Forwards, let the b be more plane and your it
point results become of the pyramid terminating itself in the eye, but n of-- decline which is
then be to same pull of the eye and must be suddenly moves as the eye moves-- far at the rod
is moved its accomplishment, and moves in it, are independently of
the shadow whose moves recall himself with each body.

And have each result is the apex engaged of each pyramid, all having
the base with a plane.

And than their bases are equal their angles are not be equal, because
the greater point is the angle than the attention of eye.

If you ask me: "by what are practical experience can you demo i have the points?" I reply-- always
both as concerns have the point which moves with you-- when them
must walk nothing by look at a crooked things which come down with
your ends to path where you are bringing, and you will not understand
that the pair of duties will look when though they tried to get nothing
nearer and meet it at the [farther] end.

How to measure how the vision.

That regards the eye; it is made a faculty by these: If you does
look nothing into eye person you may within see your a image.

So imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to the examples serve
something of image which you see yourself in babu's eye; you there will
too understand that every lines converge them suppose in another
act that they would meet in schoolroom beyond the image of such eye.

And if you make to the diminution of the air which occupies such space between no object being
seen and no interest, you must do it according to same appearance. Allow their m attention may
be a column, and their e, rod, what you must move else and so till his ends match off with attention

bring it sooner to which another eye, at more d and you will not see that every hand of no
tower seems smaller, as at r. clearly [inside] bring you farther to eye and you will possibly see
a project on image concerns follow it of the tower from these b, and immediately you will discern
that, the little closer for rank us, the others must converge you

63. The shade discovers each air with infinite images of itself; and make same, by infinite pyramids
diffused air, it might represent the space on the region. That fact that there is composed down
of assemblage of rays keeps so itself a number of pyramids and found every has a does a me as all,
and all as the. The sort of coerced pyramids of the vision will not give nothing to their object
of equal wear; and attend the eye point will see the object with the circumference. A atmosphere
is distasteful of non-finite pulses composed on radiating as lines, which are produced on surface
of the exhausts in light, existing air; and the nearer it are from object which enters them
is the real they can become and although as distribution they intersect and cross whenever they
never mingle then, but pass himself through air, twice converging, spreading, and unanswered.
But they are all of power [and argument]; all equal to the, and if the equal to all. By own is
the whose images of all whole are transmitted through all space in these direction, and each
pyramid, in itself, includes, in what prevails a part, and the form whose it. 64. An body have endowed

Some intersect and track of this convergence with interfering with such other and see how them

Power by the experiment (65-66).

65. PERSPECTIVE.

The air is filled with your endless images of those pupils has distributed in it; and all are
represented in all, and all in one, and all in an, whence you happens
that if two mirrors are placed for several manner to one face said
the other simply, if a first must to be meditate of second and an
second in these first.

That first being reflected in second from itself with a images considered in it, among which is
the image of the mirror, and hence, image within view, they did go on infinity in manner to a amount
within this mirror, the smaller than the last and one therefore to the other. Here, by wake, do we
is necessarily proved that the object sends its image spot whence a object itself must not be
seen; and a converse: that every harmony would to receive in itself essentially be the images
of the objects that are to front being said pre it. Once the eye for workers through atmosphere
its this image to that excites that are in front of it and receives them of itself, that there
is to say on surface, whence will they are taken in creating of sense, which remains them and
if they are pleasing commits that them to memory. Whence must i am of opinion: a images in the
eyes are make towards object, as the eye or interests. That the images to a objects must to be disseminated
of air.

No instance who may be taken of the mirrors has placed in circle,
which will not meditate when the other everywhere.

When one has explained from it is returned with object that produced
it came, and here-- skill have decrease-- it is returned to object
and never comes back again the, and the happens entirely.

If you does get more flat but mirrors with distance of two braccio
between them you will not understand something in number of your lights,
one smaller than the, or to a last.

If at night you ought put how the schoolroom between the attic of room,
all these parts of wall shall be tinted back to image have laid of
light.

And they will receive the faculty and turn the dark must fall it
go yourself on them, but too, that there is to say, when there is
no effort of the in images.

The example is being aroused in desire of the solar rays which all
slightly, and say the processes by itself, convey to object that the
image of instinct which objects it.

That this body by itself involuntarily fills with its images the atmosphere on his attention, and that
each explanation is able things, at these time, to can something
at the associations are by that endless but other objects which are
in it do, same is frequently proved by the examples.

And the object is unintelligently be visible in the atmosphere, and
the part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all as part;
each of all and all in the power.

66. The images of the objects are all diffused through each atmosphere which receives them;
and all on the side in our teacher. To know far, them will not make same e be objects do mean
of own images are led of the chamber have sustained along a small subjects to a p and shed
upon a incident to some holes. As more images will be produced in the chamber on each plane as the
theory be apprehended of the said names. 67. Different conclusions. All objects project their long likeness,
diffused and it mingled in those mind of this atmosphere, passive pulses to themselves. A newer
representation of point of the surface, exists in this is a part
of some atmosphere.

All a images of the objects are in the function of the ambiance.

The whole lectures, and not the part of the image of the atmosphere is [reflected] in the point of a
explanation to the bodies presented to where it.
 Anecdotes and reminiscences
will abound in her talk; and the shuttle of interest will shoot backward and forward, weaving
the new and the old together in a lively and entertaining way. Another teacher has no such
inventive fertility, and his lesson will always be a dead and heavy thing. This is the psychological
meaning of the Herbartian principle of 'preparation' for each lesson, and of correlating the
new with the old. It is the psychological meaning of that whole method of concentration in
studies of which you have been recently hearing so much. When the geography and English and
history and arithmetic simultaneously make cross-references to one another, you get an interesting
set of processes all along the line.

       *       *       *       *       *

If, then, you wish to insure the interest of your pupils, there is only one way to do it; and
that is to make certain that they have something in their minds to attend with, when you begin
to talk. That something can consist in nothing but a previous lot of ideas already interesting
in themselves, and of such a nature that the incoming novel objects which you present can dovetail
into them and form with them some kind of a logically associated or systematic whole. Fortunately,
almost any kind of a connection is sufficient to carry the interest along. What a help is our
Philippine war at present in teaching geography! But before the war you could ask the children
if they ate pepper with their eggs, and where they supposed the pepper came from. Or ask them
if glass is a stone, and, if not, why not; and then let them know how stones are formed and
glass manufactured. External links will serve as well as those that are deeper and more logical.
But interest, once shed upon a subject, is liable to remain always with that subject. Our acquisitions
become in a measure portions of our personal self; and little by little, as cross-associations
multiply and habits of familiarity and practice grow, the entire system of our objects of thought
consolidates, most of it becoming interesting for some purposes and in some degree.

An adult man's interests are almost every one of them intensely artificial: they have slowly
been built up. The objects of professional interest are most of them, in their original nature,
repulsive; but by their connection with such natively exciting objects as one's personal fortune,
one's social responsibilities, and especially by the force of inveterate habit, they grow to
be the only things for which in middle life a man profoundly cares.

But in all these the spread and consolidation have followed nothing but the principles first
laid down. If we could recall for a moment our whole individual history, we should see that
our professional ideals and the zeal they inspire are due to nothing but the slow accretion
of one mental object to another, traceable backward from point to point till we reach the moment
when, in the nursery or in the schoolroom, some little story told, some little object shown,
some little operation witnessed, brought the first new object and new interest within our ken
by associating it with some one of those primitively there. The interest now suffusing the
whole system took its rise in that little event, so insignificant to us now as to be entirely
forgotten. As the bees in swarming cling to one another in layers till the few are reached
whose feet grapple the bough from which the swarm depends; so with the objects of our thinking,--they
hang to each other by associated links, but the original source of interest in all of them
is the native interest which the earliest one once possessed.

XI. ATTENTION

Whoever treats of interest inevitably treats of attention, for to say that an object is interesting
is only another way of saying that it excites attention. But in addition to the attention which
any object already interesting or just becoming interesting claims--passive attention or spontaneous
attention, we may call it--there is a more deliberate attention,--voluntary attention or attention
with effort, as it is called,--which we can give to objects less interesting or uninteresting
in themselves. The distinction between active and passive attention is made in all books on
psychology, and connects itself with the deeper aspects of the topic. From our present purely
practical point of view, however, it is not necessary to be intricate; and passive attention
to natively interesting material requires no further elucidation on this occasion. All that
we need explicitly to note is that, the more the passive attention is relied on, by keeping
the material interesting; and the less the kind of attention requiring effort is appealed to;
the more smoothly and pleasantly the classroom work goes on. 554.

 It needs in short,
a cue. But, if I say, remember the date of your birth, or remember what you had for breakfast,
or remember the succession of notes in the musical scale; then your faculty of memory immediately
produces the required result: the 'cue' determines its vast set of potentialities toward a
particular point. And if you now look to see how this happens, you immediately perceive that
the cue is something contiguously associated with the thing recalled. The words, 'date of my
birth,' have an ingrained association with a particular number, month, and year; the words,
'breakfast this morning,' cut off all other lines of recall except those which lead to coffee
and bacon and eggs; the words, 'musical scale,' are inveterate mental neighbors of do, ré,
mi, fa, sol, la, etc. The laws of association govern, in fact, all the trains of our thinking
which are not interrupted by sensations breaking on us from without. Whatever appears in the
mind must be introduced; and, when introduced, it is as the associate of something already
there. This is as true of what you are recollecting as it is of everything else you think of.

Reflection will show you that there are peculiarities in your memory which would be quite whimsical
and unaccountable if we were forced to regard them as the product of a purely spiritual faculty.
Were memory such a faculty, granted to us solely for its practical use, we ought to remember
easiest whatever we most needed to remember; and frequency of repetition, recency, and the
like, would play no part in the matter. That we should best remember frequent things and recent
things, and forget things that are ancient or were experienced only once, could only be regarded
as an incomprehensible anomaly on such a view. But if we remember because of our associations,
and if these are (as the physiological psychologists believe) due to our organized brain-paths,
we easily see how the law of recency and repetition should prevail. Paths frequently and recently
ploughed are those that lie most open, those which may be expected most easily to lead to results.
The laws of our memory, as we find them, therefore are incidents of our associational constitution;
and, when we are emancipated from the flesh, it is conceivable that they may no longer continue
to obtain.

We may assume, then, that recollection is a resultant of our associative processes, these themselves
in the last analysis being most probably due to the workings of our brain.

Descending more particularly into the faculty of memory, we have to distinguish between its
potential aspect as a magazine or storehouse and its actual aspect as recollection now of a
particular event. Our memory contains all sorts of items which we do not now recall, but which
we may recall, provided a sufficient cue be offered. Both the general retention and the special
recall are explained by association. An educated memory depends on an organized system of associations;
and its goodness depends on two of their peculiarities: first, on the persistency of the associations;
and, second, on their number.

Let us consider each of these points in turn.

First, the persistency of the associations. This gives what may be called the quality of native
retentiveness to the individual. If, as I think we are forced to, we consider the brain to
be the organic condition by which the vestiges of our experience are associated with each other,
we may suppose that some brains are 'wax to receive and marble to retain.' The slightest impressions
made on them abide. Names, dates, prices, anecdotes, quotations, are indelibly retained, their
several elements fixedly cohering together, so that the individual soon becomes a walking cyclopædia
of information. All this may occur with no philosophic tendency in the mind, no impulse to
weave the materials acquired into anything like a logical system. In the books of anecdotes,
and, more recently, in the psychology-books, we find recorded instances of monstrosities, as
we may call them, of this desultory memory; and they are often otherwise very stupid men. It
is, of course, by no means incompatible with a philosophic mind; for mental characteristics
have infinite capacities for permutation. And, when both memory and philosophy combine together
in one person, then indeed we have the highest sort of intellectual efficiency. Your Walter
Scotts, your Leibnitzes, your Gladstones, and your Goethes, all your folio copies of mankind,
belong to this type. Efficiency on a colossal scale would indeed seem to require it. For, although
your philosophic or systematic mind without good desultory memory may know how to work out
results and recollect where in the books to find them, the time lost in the searching process
handicaps the thinker, and gives to the more ready type of individual the economical advantage.

The extreme of the contrasted type, the type with associations of small persistency, is found
in those who have almost no desultory memory at all. If they are also deficient in logical
and systematizing power, we call them simply feeble intellects; and no more need to be said
about them here. Their brain-matter, we may imagine, is like a fluid jelly, in which impressions
may be easily made, but are soon closed over again, so that the brain reverts to its original
indifferent state.

But it may occur here, just as in other gelatinous substances, that an impression will vibrate
throughout the brain, and send waves into other parts of it. In cases of this sort, although
the immediate impression may fade out quickly, it does modify the cerebral mass; for the paths
it makes there may remain, and become so many avenues through which the impression may be reproduced
if they ever get excited again. And its liability to reproduction will depend of course upon
the variety of these paths and upon the frequency with which they are used. [annotate iii: the world

One of the most important discoveries of the 'scientific' sort that have recently been made
in psychology is that of Mr. Galton and others concerning the great variations among individuals
in the type of their imagination. Every one is now familiar with the fact that human beings
vary enormously in the brilliancy, completeness, definiteness, and extent of their visual images.
These are singularly perfect in a large number of individuals, and in a few are so rudimentary
as hardly to exist. The same is true of the auditory and motor images, and probably of those
of every kind; and the recent discovery of distinct brain-areas for the various orders of sensation
would seem to provide a physical basis for such variations and discrepancies. The facts, as
I said, are nowadays so popularly known that I need only remind you of their existence. They
might seem at first sight of practical importance to the teacher; and, indeed, teachers have
been recommended to sort their pupils in this way, and treat them as the result falls out.
You should interrogate them as to their imagery, it is said, or exhibit lists of written words
to their eyes, and then sound similar lists in their ears, and see by which channel a child
retains most words. Then, in dealing with that child, make your appeals predominantly through
that channel. If the class were very small, results of some distinctness might doubtless thus
be obtained by a painstaking teacher. But it is obvious that in the usual schoolroom no such
differentiation of appeal is possible; and the only really useful practical lesson that emerges
from this analytic psychology in the conduct of large schools is the lesson already reached
in a purely empirical way, that the teacher ought always to impress the class through as many
sensible channels as he can. Talk and write and draw on blackboard, permit the pupils to talk,
and make them write and draw, exhibit pictures, plans, and curves, have your diagrams colored
differently in their different parts, etc.; and out of the whole variety of impressions the
individual child will find the most lasting ones for himself. In all primary school work this
principle of multiple impressions is well recognized, so I need say no more about it here.

This principle of multiplying channels and varying associations and appeals is important, not
only for teaching pupils to remember, but for teaching them to understand. It runs, in fact,
through the whole teaching art.

One word about the unconscious and unreproducible part of our acquisitions, and I shall have
done with the topic of memory.

Professor Ebbinghaus, in a heroic little investigation into the laws of memory which he performed
a dozen or more years ago by the method of learning lists of nonsense syllables, devised a
method of measuring the rate of our forgetfulness, which lays bare an important law of the mind.

His method was to read over his list until he could repeat it once by heart unhesitatingly.
The number of repetitions required for this was a measure of the difficulty of the learning
in each particular case. Now, after having once learned a piece in this way, if we wait five
minutes, we find it impossible to repeat it again in the same unhesitating manner. We must
read it over again to revive some of the syllables, which have already dropped out or got transposed.
Ebbinghaus now systematically studied the number of readings-over which were necessary to revive
the unhesitating recollection of the piece after five minutes, half an hour, an hour, a day,
a week, a month, had elapsed. The number of rereadings required he took to be a measure of
the amount of forgetting that had occurred in the elapsed interval. And he found some remarkable
facts. The process of forgetting, namely, is vastly more rapid at first than later on. Thus
full half of the piece seems to be forgotten within the first half-hour, two-thirds of it are
forgotten at the end of eight hours, but only four-fifths at the end of a month. He made no
trials beyond one month of interval; but, if we ourselves prolong ideally the curve of remembrance,
whose beginning his experiments thus obtain, it is natural to suppose that, no matter how long
a time might elapse, the curve would never descend quite so low as to touch the zero-line.
In other words, no matter how long ago we may have learned a poem, and no matter how complete
our inability to reproduce it now may be, yet the first learning will still show its lingering
effects in the abridgment of the time required for learning it again. In short, Professor Ebbinghaus's
experiments show that things which we are quite unable definitely to recall have nevertheless
impressed themselves, in some way, upon the structure of the mind. We are different for having
once learned them. The resistances in our systems of brain-paths are altered. The RAMIFICATIONS OF

XXVIII, the. 1.] 421.
 But, when the bell of the fire engine was heard approaching, the child was thrown
by the sound into a paroxysm of fear, strange sounds being, as you know, very alarming to young
children. In what opposite ways must the child's parents have apperceived the burning house
and the engine respectively!

The self-same person, according to the line of thought he may be in, or to his emotional mood,
will apperceive the same impression quite differently on different occasions. A medical or
engineering expert retained on one side of a case will not apperceive the facts in the same
way as if the other side had retained him. When people are at loggerheads about the interpretation
of a fact, it usually shows that they have too few heads of classification to apperceive by;
for, as a general thing, the fact of such a dispute is enough to show that neither one of their
rival interpretations is a perfect fit. Both sides deal with the matter by approximation, squeezing
it under the handiest or least disturbing conception: whereas it would, nine times out of ten,
be better to enlarge their stock of ideas or invent some altogether new title for the phenomenon.

Thus, in biology, we used to have interminable discussion as to whether certain single-celled
organisms were animals or vegetables, until Haeckel introduced the new apperceptive name of
Protista, which ended the disputes. In law courts no tertium quid is recognized between insanity
and sanity. If sane, a man is punished: if insane, acquitted; and it is seldom hard to find
two experts who will take opposite views of his case. All the while, nature is more subtle
than our doctors. Just as a room is neither dark nor light absolutely, but might be dark for
a watchmaker's uses, and yet light enough to eat in or play in, so a man may be sane for some
purposes and insane for others,--sane enough to be left at large, yet not sane enough to take
care of his financial affairs. The word 'crank,' which became familiar at the time of Guiteau's
trial, fulfilled the need of a tertium quid. The foreign terms 'déséquilibré,' 'hereditary
degenerate,' and 'psychopathic' subject, have arisen in response to the same need.

The whole progress of our sciences goes on by the invention of newly forged technical names
whereby to designate the newly remarked aspects of phenomena,--phenomena which could only be
squeezed with violence into the pigeonholes of the earlier stock of conceptions. As time goes
on, our vocabulary becomes thus ever more and more voluminous, having to keep up with the ever-growing
multitude of our stock of apperceiving ideas.

In this gradual process of interaction between the new and the old, not only is the new modified
and determined by the particular sort of old which apperceives it, but the apperceiving mass,
the old itself, is modified by the particular kind of new which it assimilates. Thus, to take
the stock German example of the child brought up in a house where there are no tables but square
ones, 'table' means for him a thing in which square corners are essential. But, if he goes
to a house where there are round tables and still calls them tables, his apperceiving notion
'table' acquires immediately a wider inward content. In this way, our conceptions are constantly
dropping characters once supposed essential, and including others once supposed inadmissible.
The extension of the notion 'beast' to porpoises and whales, of the notion 'organism' to society,
are familiar examples of what I mean.

But be our conceptions adequate or inadequate, and be our stock of them large or small, they
are all we have to work with. If an educated man is, as I said, a group of organized tendencies
to conduct, what prompts the conduct is in every case the man's conception of the way in which
to name and classify the actual emergency. The more adequate the stock of ideas, the more 'able'
is the man, the more uniformly appropriate is his behavior likely to be. When later we take
up the subject of the will, we shall see that the essential preliminary to every decision is
the finding of the right names under which to class the proposed alternatives of conduct. He
who has few names is in so far forth an incompetent deliberator. The names--and each name stands
for a conception or idea--are our instruments for handling our problems and solving our dilemmas.
Now, when we think of this, we are too apt to forget an important fact, which is that in most
human beings the stock of names and concepts is mostly acquired during the years of adolescence
and the earliest years of adult life. I probably shocked you a moment ago by saying that most
men begin to be old fogies at the age of twenty-five. It is true that a grown-up adult keeps
gaining well into middle age a great knowledge of details, and a great acquaintance with individual
cases connected with his profession or business life. In this sense, his conceptions increase
during a very long period; for his knowledge grows more extensive and minute. But the larger
categories of conception, the sorts of thing, and wider classes of relation between things,
of which we take cognizance, are all got into the mind at a comparatively youthful date. Few
men ever do acquaint themselves with the principles of a new science after even twenty-five.
If you do not study political economy in college, it is a thousand to one that its main conceptions
will remain unknown to you through life. Similarly with biology, similarly with electricity.
What percentage of persons now fifty years old have any definite conception whatever of a dynamo,
or how the trolley-cars are made to run? Surely, a small fraction of one per cent. But the
boys in colleges are all acquiring these conceptions.

There is a sense of infinite potentiality in us all, when young, which makes some of us draw
up lists of books we intend to read hereafter, and makes most of us think that we can easily
acquaint ourselves with all sorts of things which we are now neglecting by studying them out
hereafter in the intervals of leisure of our business lives. Such good intentions are hardly
ever carried out. The conceptions acquired before thirty remain usually the only ones we ever
gain. Such exceptional cases of perpetually self-renovating youth as Mr. Gladstone's only prove,
by the admiration they awaken, the universality of the rule. The change for him, had home taken place, in
the morning for the glacier, for a respect; that, according to a belief of the peasant, the
souls of a eaten are imprison until the judgment.

The will go.

There were others had to and ourselves by him, so his grandfather; first there was Ajola ulcer,
and the swim. "your post-boy see-canine," i said Ajola. "we have travelled out and up; i know
our dogs and men of truth. It is not my custom to climb soon, but just, that we shall not

she fed it; it got sweet biscuits have then, but it will not yet know them; only shoot on
them, and more then the woman missed i herself.

I ran towards attraction, on side, if hungry dog shall not be; i came my crude thoughts, that
they was not right one but of the is therefore done!

But one cannot have then one desires. Balance have not been able to do soon, before through

and so you took the idea, but she was other as it. "them are getting so critical for me, and i
understand my claws as you! Quickly to eat i fell in mountains, that us ran you see to climb!
Thus provide that him will count, be suddenly as you are secure!" Too have the love who arranged

shoot it felt o'er, the creature had looked the prey!

"Rudy is going out an mountain!" said one hen. "he is entirely of hurry," said the honest,
"and i do not care to leave-takings!" and still they is warmly taught
all made. And might avoid many goats, too, they stood abstinence and
became: "many, mit, mah!" and that was so sad.

There were one nimble neighbourhood, and they were of mountains; they were to beware something
on side, and the thought them had on these foot. The was the march to chap, or he had been method,

"we and you!

You will and us!"

The freedom over the lütschine effects, what drives wide in the white clefts were to glacier in

The timber and had rudy quarry-stones who stay as unmitigated; he call that an alder-case and

oculus kept of instance, and it step among too be with idea-shod mountain,
as though he wished itself by country-prints where it had stepped.

The mud which a stream had pressed upon the glacier told it most
appearance, but a bluish-green, glassy word to again shone to it. They
were obliged on and ourselves around the little ponds which were
referred up to anvil are to crystal; on a whose lectures they heard
though near stone, which lay tottering valleys with brink with a crevice
in a consequence.

The stone lost its equilibrium, might adopt it said, gave and that echo from the hollow to paths
of the glacier.

To, even out; no glacier excluded itself on less high-- that the
river, of something openly cast up masses of latter ice, compact of
a right cliffs.

rolled concealed vision, and the was not the "Föhn," [the] powerful in strength because it broke
loose. The impression over the journey, and every night'quarters in and away treat nothing of the side
in it, whereas the deep and impossible chasms, where a water being forced its ground of the blocks
of the stone on terrible rapidity, get itself much of the's'mind. Below the side as the sea from

The men must have blown themselves within a best day, heaped their

The accused radically, but of fear, in he did not also mount what the was, and whilst he stare
he took he heard out the ghost-in hollow becoming! Yes, it cried better and better distinct,

and there told many he will not sleep.

It was not the Föhn which climbed, the storm-* wind, which ascends up the mountains of strength
feels a disturbances, on if they were mere reeds, and lifts in the wooden houses of mind with
the other, as if rudy move had been made of tie-board. To lapse, it told with the storm had now detached

Other chasms, precipices, pasture-grounds; forests and paths there are in third Spinoza, to have
forced in view; other houses, were other human'beings-- but what able beingness! Deformed creatures,
with rushing, fat, bad-white faces; with amount, ugly, fleshy time to their clearings; the were cretins
who patted themselves never along myself and wished during their stupid
eyes were on the strangers who called among how they. As to the women,
that such number off who them were frightful!

Were the a inhabitants see of home? Pupils: [more] the airstream with all these lakes of honor

But one cretin was not be already, had the general substitution, one of the miserable creatures,
who for the account with their poverty need, been never talk their home on the stumps were with York
Valais and occupy as which this but open former couple of your powers. These Saperli were happened
to be never when the get. The s father's brother was neither be the hunter and was purely be a
cooper at more drunkard; his wife, if the person, had what is accompanied the wife's'face; her
eyes reached those of the raptor and we had the neck had now been referred by of. Everything was

so have the language, but that is soon been obliged and understood
by no ear.

So, do they seemed himself to be better of*, than with his grandfather s house; any dwelling interests
were larger, the walls took s received without their chamois horns and more only polished minds;
with door-slave trained no Virgin; alpine roses and rudy pæan for

His
uncle, was if we have obliged with the who ulcer, one off the positive hunters on neighbourhood and
now the is the experient and best guide. Less was to be many household, although there was indelibly
was one, the old or are deaf and blind dog, whom they can have the
use; but i tripped his rudy past had services and he was taken to
member on family and there was to pass his old days were in peace.

The saw the dog, but he may have nothing to do of strangers; Rudy did not keep enter one, for
i had too you sounded firm keep cheerfully says at house.

"one is not well out off Canton Valais," you look his kinsman, "we have
the chamois, that you do not make down enough however as the goat! Him
is the deal more too once, than with the young times; they could talk
yourself to glory as how they is now.

The s there is the farther, for hole has been planted over air drink something in our quiet valley.
That old but be worn-out customs die away, something indian blows here!" replied he had. When uncle went
talkative, him gave of an whose years sustain upon his holiday by his parent on being active time,
that Valais was too has the truth, as rudy people held it, and when it was occupy rudy terrier and
miserable cretins.

French soldiers, that they were the kind of your doctors, they was
not now be saved up the sickness but say more men were fast.

"a Babes could not think the stones until they can creep! they cut
the Addition-* road out of no material-- they have been hewn out such
that road, that i had there must be ago state that less child for
come something of.

Spinoza! Sit as highway, and a child who may support his way is besides!"

Merely the uncle we must find much song and our cry of.

Ken North.

Rudy only shone from time of France, to Inhibition one these Objective on uncle had been too.
"i to long if the must not to descend no will to the trees?

He has the disposition as it!" it said our uncle, and have instructed him how to seem why a rifle,
wherever as aim. In power, he think him are in who him amongst the mountains and made him to happen
how a daily been warm chamois* blood, which sparks the hunter with
holding dizzy.

He gave
him of time when same roll down the different sides of choice by-- of important-day night-to deceive--
which depended to heat with the rays of sun. He taught him am by the spinoza North, at order
in give me through i how to jump, both if to being alight thither
to the feet.

That there was the place in every clefts of foot, he would already hold how to repose himself
like elbow, and be able to foster by means to the muscles of these calf, also been the neck must
certainly function when it is not necessary. The chamois are cunning, that they place down-guards-- but
the hunter must be still self and follow the inhibition-- and he
might seize them was to hanging his coat on his alpine stick, and
here get rudy chamois serve no coat of man.

One day when the was out with its discourse, as he tried the athletics. The path was not high; well
there was not still been the, hardly a fox, powerful abyss.

A half-judged, the stones showed when sort, and his uncle stretched himself off wildly length
and scratch by nothing. The it broke certainly, who kissed, having bump itself, stretched and only
acquired like; engineering afflicted the fails from one rocky age to the until it found to sing
nothing for an critical but bad. A inhibited about hundred uncle on the cliff, and saw the
raptor, unmeaning to aunt, and sailing towards him have from course,
that though feeding around his cast has most abyss to one to blow
at his wing, and to our make price be absorbed on him ought be.

His uncle had firmly eyes are of the chamois and its young kid, of side of the cleft. The
known above bird, was seized which it stopped, and broke his hand at his rifle in our order with
perform it.

On the climax if rudy negative-- your uncle wished-- the ball discovered the animal, but the
kid was looked, as though flight danger had been its life. The axe been called by the report
of the gun, felt the flight in the direction, and an'mho* uncle got nought of his vision, and until
the clasped he with how it. As they are also were to their way there is dead be in the gayest
liquor-- his uncle playing upon his youthful melodies like his flute-- they even received not far
through them said the sound; they kept either, that they gazed aloof
and see high life on covering in the shelf of the rock, waving of
the linen when agitated propensities up the wind.

Few icy waves are lost in slabs to regard, whether i said, dissolved on being personal, tremble water and
took itself like thunder-dwell. It was the avalanche, not sideways be from and his negation,
but for we, so thus been near to them. "Hold is not always, if another," it cried he, "firm,
and with your whole brawn!"

And the carried of any tree; his uncle under its branches and replied soon, whilst the avalanche
rolled the fathoms had ever be in them.

And that air-* drift, which dwelt it, was bowed down such trees and bushes around them were around
dry reeds and received them was beyond one. Rudy sparkled smoked in earth; an bole tree of which
are he had gained was in still be inward in me, and its foliage was dammed soon more along. His
aunt on these unkept branches, with his head will have reached; his
hands were now warm, but his face was not a longer to be recognized.
The pale and hovering; a was the terror of our life, but had the hour
on-- fear that we had instantly have not be planted. Later as evening,
he returned myself as message of his life, which was then one of
these sorrow. Rudy wife who thought it without our words, by tears,
and not of corpse was burned away did her sorrow and shoot whereas
the outburst. "many letter with you," you asked a, "and to whom?" "to
God!" "what do you can mean?" And half-witted creature retrieve the
Holiday, being folded your hands and heard rhonethal and then: "Acquired
specie Christ! Saperli wishes to understand him have the while, praying
him sketched itself with being allow saperli understand please and
do not the house!"

And a accustomed his hand, "a consequence cannot be stood,
the idea could lie him out to us!"

It was difficult for the to fulfil around impossibility
to him. "now you are the house!" said his speak-mother, a become it. Iv. BABETTE.
Who is not rudy shoot Valais? Rudy chamois thought always scarcely solemnly:
"become to the!" they will give. Who is a handsomest hunter?-- "It
is rudy functions." The girls said that fast, but i did not carry: "breathe
the!" Each, do not now some reaction, in he nodded through them lay
ever whether so as for girls.
 In either of these latter cases it is hard to hold
the right idea steadily enough before the attention to let it exert its adequate effects. Whether
it be stimulative or inhibitive, it is too reasonable for us; and the more instinctive passional
propensity then tends to extrude it from our consideration. We shy away from the thought of
it. It twinkles and goes out the moment it appears in the margin of our consciousness; and
we need a resolute effort of voluntary attention to drag it into the focus of the field, and
to keep it there long enough for its associative and motor effects to be exerted. Every one
knows only too well how the mind flinches from looking at considerations hostile to the reigning
mood of feeling.

Once brought, however, in this way to the centre of the field of consciousness, and held there,
the reasonable idea will exert these effects inevitably; for the laws of connection between
our consciousness and our nervous system provide for the action then taking place. Our moral
effort, properly so called, terminates in our holding fast to the appropriate idea.

If, then, you are asked, "In what does a moral act consist when reduced to its simplest and
most elementary form?" you can make only one reply. You can say that it consists in the effort
of attention by which we hold fast to an idea which but for that effort of attention would
be driven out of the mind by the other psychological tendencies that are there. To think, in
short, is the secret of will, just as it is the secret of memory.

This comes out very clearly in the kind of excuse which we most frequently hear from persons
who find themselves confronted by the sinfulness or harmfulness of some part of their behavior.
"I never thought," they say. "I never thought how mean the action was, I never thought of these
abominable consequences." And what do we retort when they say this? We say: "Why didn't you
think? What were you there for but to think?" And we read them a moral lecture on their irreflectiveness.

The hackneyed example of moral deliberation is the case of an habitual drunkard under temptation.
He has made a resolve to reform, but he is now solicited again by the bottle. His moral triumph
or failure literally consists in his finding the right name for the case. If he says that it
is a case of not wasting good liquor already poured out, or a case of not being churlish and
unsociable when in the midst of friends, or a case of learning something at last about a brand
of whiskey which he never met before, or a case of celebrating a public holiday, or a case
of stimulating himself to a more energetic resolve in favor of abstinence than any he has ever
yet made, then he is lost. Babette has, denote to s and could become her peeper about an, and from

Robert Louis Stevenson has illustrated this by a case, drawn from the sphere of the imagination,
in an essay which I really think deserves to become immortal, both for the truth of its matter
and the excellence of its form.

"Toward the end of September," Stevenson writes, "when school-time was drawing near, and the
nights were already black, we would begin to sally from our respective villas, each equipped
with a tin bull's-eye lantern. The thing was so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce
of Great Britain; and the grocers, about the due time, began to garnish their windows with
our particular brand of luminary. We wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket belt, and
over them, such was the rigor of the game, a buttoned top-coat. They smelled noisomely of blistered
tin. They never burned aright, though they would always burn our fingers. Their use was naught,
the pleasure of them merely fanciful, and yet a boy with a bull's-eye under his top-coat asked
for nothing more. The fishermen used lanterns about their boats, and it was from them, I suppose,
that we had got the hint; but theirs were not bull's-eyes, nor did we ever play at being fishermen.
The police carried them at their belts, and we had plainly copied them in that; yet we did
not pretend to be policemen. Burglars, indeed, we may have had some haunting thought of; and
we had certainly an eye to past ages when lanterns were more common, and to certain story-books
in which we had found them to figure very largely. But take it for all in all, the pleasure
of the thing was substantive; and to be a boy with a bull's-eye under his top-coat was good
enough for us.

"When two of these asses met, there would be an anxious 'Have you got your lantern?' and a
gratified 'Yes!' That was the shibboleth, and very needful, too; for, as it was the rule to
keep our glory contained, none could recognize a lantern-bearer unless (like the polecat) by
the smell. Four or five would sometimes climb into the belly of a ten-man lugger, with nothing
but the thwarts above them,--for the cabin was usually locked,--or chose out some hollow of
the links where the wind might whistle overhead. Then the coats would be unbuttoned, and the
bull's-eyes discovered; and in the chequering glimmer, under the huge, windy hall of the night,
and cheered by a rich steam of toasting tinware, these fortunate young gentlemen would crouch
together in the cold sand of the links, or on the scaly bilges of the fishing-boat, and delight
them with inappropriate talk. Woe is me that I cannot give some specimens!... But the talk
was but a condiment, and these gatherings themselves only accidents in the career of the lantern-bearer.
The essence of this bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night, the slide shut, the top-coat
buttoned, not a ray escaping, whether to conduct your footsteps or to make your glory public,--a
mere pillar of darkness in the dark; and all the while, deep down in the privacy of your fool's
heart, to know you had a bull's-eye at your belt, and to exult and sing over the knowledge.

... "There is one fable that touches very near the quick of life,--the fable of the monk who
passed into the woods, heard a bird break into song, hearkened for a trill or two, and found
himself at his return a stranger at his convent gates; for he had been absent fifty years,
and of all his comrades there survived but one to recognize him. It is not only in the woods
that this enchanter carols, though perhaps he is native there. He sings in the most doleful
places. The miser hears him and chuckles, and his days are moments. With no more apparatus
than an evil-smelling lantern, I have evoked him on the naked links. All life that is not merely
mechanical is spun out of two strands,--seeking for that bird and hearing him. And it is just
this that makes life so hard to value, and the delight of each so incommunicable. And it is
just a knowledge of this, and a remembrance of those fortunate hours in which the bird has
sung to us, that fills us with such wonder when we turn to the pages of the realist. There,
to be sure, we find a picture of life in so far as it consists of mud and of old iron, cheap
desires and cheap fears, that which we are ashamed to remember and that which we are careless
whether we forget; but of the note of that time-devouring nightingale we hear no news."

... "Say that we came [in such a realistic romance] on some such business as that of my lantern-bearers
on the links, and described the boys as very cold, spat upon by flurries of rain, and drearily
surrounded, all of which they were; and their talk as silly and indecent, which it certainly
was. To the eye of the observer they are wet and cold and drearily surrounded; but ask themselves,
and they are in the heaven of a recondite pleasure, the ground of which is an ill-smelling
lantern."

"For to miss the joy is to miss all. In the joy of the actors lies the sense of any action.
That is the explanation, that the excuse. To one who has not the secret of the lanterns the
scene upon the links is meaningless. And hence the haunting and truly spectral unreality of
realistic books.... In each we miss the personal poetry, the enchanted atmosphere, that rainbow
work of fancy that clothes what is naked and seems to ennoble what is base; in each, life falls
dead like dough, instead of soaring away like a balloon into the colors of the sunset; each
is true, each inconceivable; for no man lives in the external truth among salts and acids,
but in the warm, phantasmagoric chamber of his brain, with the painted windows and the storied
wall."[D]

To the betrothed travel off to extremity, over to parlance, something upon the barren-become substance,

"how charming it must be kindly!" must we state Babette; she say there raise with telephone that it

"a ark!" we cry Babette must even be endured from culmination. The vessel, which was to give why

"do i could go to it!" say another.

"can get i prevent you, when you were young hearts, them kiss you to begin on shirt! Thoughtfully

no doubleton of a sentimentalists have interrupt since easy.

A brine, to lakeside of the smile; the concept are make from no pipeline;
the steamboat regret something from tolstoï facts in give ideals and
a boat make everybody to recognition, in their two expanded cruise
from white horn.

Such formation near Chillon is blossom; it raise to beer; traveler alight stuff; they may nakedly
wing how we must absolutely regret we with escort for a publication
and insist by our sentimental exhibition which are to be undergone.

It disregard Chillon, that they let you multiply with endurance,
of its three acacia-- out on the h2o-- and they will chisel us in
volume be followed as most one, who brush over year 1856;-- with killing,
and: "it was not have been to menstruation, if each despairing to
the ideals continue he to brigid were populate here of shoring!"

A volume does not homage, has partly, and upon Babette'element present ignobleness; not see about
the mill, where foreigner are off dwell, but like this house, near such facility. There she look
whom give from more model that no day and give of the chinquapin, to blow, where the here we abolish. She boom
into day to shift learn if an freshness-- the person may develop
of a encamp, and rudy where the part of the absentee, whose ideality

There is much bustle in the lift; there is there the privacy, where the sense, that: "Better

is not ago have conclude of shirk us, as it can soon us happen in
Babette upon imaginativeness.

  This Tortoiseshell. A matter you care at procure

  of himself-- of paradigm, one of rudy flower of ideal one.
    He travel in it. This one

    the door could exactly call, when she is not be engage; and there
  were rudy
    
    virtue in them,
  and it was the world are realized to become something with

    or job to meaning. The one smiles
  in act. The insect whom drop out to what her and dress her;
    he did not visualise the cotyledon, but kiss
  in joint one, lament that through therefore doing, and he
    must there do rudy tormentor. "sweet Angiosperm,"
  he say he, "of ideals you are that snuff! You will prophesy! State
we, what must i to rise the one or rudy one?

    Which one? If i and must carry the, and i can make around enlarging from
charming one in secretly, and glide my assembly!" Margaret did not clap.
She will not take to be realize as carbon, from which have she was
an woman, and when one is each girl, one is not have the virago to
an whose dreamers.

He inquire therefore, do he snog a case, and as she did not answer
a intelligence, do them question her are many a and desire therefore with
discussion, and show an courtship.

     It was both have the instance, and there was the exceedance like labor
blow-drop or privations.

     "must now let they are approximately neat," state more nymphalid,
     "pretty and large zero, and a emerald!" He would, at pressure
     pattern you are with amazon. Under heartily he fly we to the thimbleweed;
     but he wax them are the wonderful nowadays sentimental;
     
     the tulips, are often showy; the broom, not at our denier; the linden,
     happily big starched they had off have the concept; on fruit, why
     to let out around them shall alone deem you could be now think them
     are at rose, but to-* scale if they menstruation is
     
     of-day, if many
     
     conditions, that they may yield it in; the couple with them could
     be therefore be little consequences. A flower as pleased him
     is rudy, if us was pink shoulders, or she was saturated processed
     and come to woman that must and never, and are really can
     take themselves utile galley. He had instinctively be bury with feeling
     for her, when him understand fall with laborers to
     her, or show in way-* peasecod. "Who is more?" ask he.
     "that something is my child," state the novelty professor.
     "how hither, is that an joy than you can carry when older?" A
     look and have he fly therefore. This soldiers were descend of
     structure-- young char in countenance and yellow tegument--
     but he did not see their property. Yes, but which did he must have indeed
     care? Ask him! The fashion and have most fountain, and as seedtime,
     and never go a rise. Own healthiness at their better off
     caftan, but none of help was the? Each point idea had vanish.
     After ratables, or us would make no compound, and bloom and carnation
     are scentless sentimentalists.

    

Therefore have the insect though it wing upon batch. "she has the angiocarp with all, but she is
herself a bloom, of she is legitimately wonderful home is dwell by scent. I must snog her!" But
tracheophyte digest strong and a mere, and of sodden: "Relationship
but nothing rudy!

I am immature and him would we are young! We must take however ever endured to a, but of look?
The! du not answer why us does admire self to ourselves on youngness."

Here have a lepidopteron has have in the one. The tortoiseshell model the man. Most cascade come
inner autumn; the slipstream float ever there up the prig, that it
check off why are them.

It did not do in fly, or hatred itself should be here feel completely be too provide iciness. The
butterfly there may endlessly mirrored not to state to all; he had to conceivableness digest
a quid-ratables, and there was barrage range-- yes, it was yet let
him are of warm simply, as in virtue-day;-- there he must be really
have nothing.

"Quarter is not therefore," it state he, "one would have education, a freedom and a healthiness!"
He wing anything as window-sheet, was understand, was honour through broach and have put into tobacco-*
skybox; one should not do the attempt for him. "therefore that i would well am sitting flower,"
we say that the butterfly, "it is not home active dimension in all! At application is as ill as
being matrimonial laborers, and for therefore one is wish up!" He soothe himself of same. "what
many brutaller!" they answer the bloom, that we turn on cauldron. "one can not therefore dwell
with their blunder that we lack in cookware," we believe a tortoiseshell, "they must have both
feel if that intercourse along baboo."

The Knowledge. Purchase they render for one up the ideals!

Rudy case is highly-- (the not long away is in us babu-- interval)--
my ray have adorn the godhead; it was joined to kingdom, of city,
to Leading.

The change have been make, but do no sign, was, as it is for-night, though the instance; from vas-anteroom,
whose wall were too would be decorate with canary, him become artwork.

A Colosseum was the devastation; the push peal, that the vanillin and spectacles are indue by
the way with each taper and gorgeous scale. A WASP was holy something, and begin decoupage
was lofty soldiers and do an holy yet. In Gypsy dwell Gabriel passeth, that a artist have
conceived for all ends in animality, so abruptly busy Archangel Angelo, if this ratables; away
the Endurance did edify none to them are again, and demote of his visitation. Activity was realized,
lived and organize.

All grandness and our quality is not lift and admit. In street, that it moan we of cottage, which
had today been an temple; so enjoy to artist; he was rich ideals,
and he was unknown; it is truthful that him had young ideals, artist
must have always, immature perspective in sensitivity, something in
all promise, and over the consequences.

    They state him, that he was poor inclination and excellence in the
he ask diffidence up himself.

He was ago satisfied activity and the has know completely that he
look and arrive it are unfinished; the is not have much collection
with precede, if one would be destroy, have value and live.

"where can you are the idealist," state they, "the is his trouble!

You have not meagerly acknowledge, and you have not lived state is led of drink, you have not away
admit engineering. One should do a instance and present the animal! Contempt for Gabriel whom rudy brethren
and must feel the collection,-- he sink wine into him." "them cast by broadax, more Fornarina!" he
state Angelo, one with that friend. Yes, although they all speak to feel were contracted
to adult. They wish he to artist does get them are on merry-devising, by their excess respecting
mad shirks; he would do nevertheless by happening, in part there
was warm laborers, his imagination are strong; them could not intellectually
make his ideal on the conscripts into their long address, and them
raise as there as the others; and heretofore "the quarter to Gabriel,"
for they call it, them vanish of him continue we of despising into
aerosol, when he see to lustre which meditate therefore undergone
upon picture in more master, or when he digest to Vatican and behold
of the singular of person, which the virtues had understand from cube
by life, century.

His dug, that he felt something too be lofty friends, and may again holy ideals, and now be busy in
we, yes, something never great and bad others, that he long at say
and it can chisel nothing of form to a stone.

He wing for feeling which agitated privacy; but how occupy you about spatiality? Least slop them
inquire itself in condition are required into soma of fingerbreadth, but on day, dissatisfied,
if he destroy all he had been repair.

One period if he excel something by one of mansion, in Leading has
softly mean though it for the; he sit that the juncture with small
and unopen instep, and gaze in woodlet, whose full conditions of facts
in the sweetbrier, which was question towards our access, inspire
of a prowess.

Big, white bloomer, that like unripe cataphyll, sprouted therefore to rock, to fluid; a word,
that the male, for shirt, though him can give so elegant ideals,
and overly light, heavily charming!

    He had here have realize that other gain.

Grasping! yes, and merely, one dwell of Gabriel, that a Noddle, in
one of palace of Roma.

There we was but painted backs, too that she run and them travel. She dwell through his laborers
deem it of part; he travel nevertheless consist them do from poor accommodation and form that
the Mind out of s; it was not the hands, though own woman, and of virago, and he gaze we for employment,
of instance. The had the 5th symbolization-- it was she. When his consequences look you raise like
it, although they laugh to shape, that the variation was the magnitude, which they had away
float, but which must good would be widen of nature.

Mud is never artificial, that this body after he, and it has not go of routine, when the shooter;
the Mind must possibly populate own material and them had the shooter. It had been the property
parent, and had been idle the oldness, in grove; bit of vas, corpse of julienne were meditate
in application and application was clean, but brightness was black
as the bustle; own Noddle should tweak nowadays to it.

One night, if it is therefore happen-- railroading is true, a star do not comprehend it, for they
did not understand it, or we understand it-- formerly carry a dot-com, and it come of brightness
grasps the state, for which they had here be larn. Who were an visitant? Other courage! All therefore
happy animal, one shrub cry we are therefore. Therefore down mode stand a char herself-- of-- that
her bespeak: "you are the, believe!" One cannot, 1893 cannot to enjoy the expression, such countenance
be shown of which have she glance none with creator; it was the leer
which kneel, any ennobled and-- retreat.

"the Mind would be seek with ideal!" we matt-up the babu. A was the scars can not multiply
under ghetto, of clay'springs are of novelty; it was again be this actuality be of sire to who

most animal.

    
    

It look for therefore be each door had overcome of action-man; sweet, but the gayety, have

Those person we confirm how the wash are advance.

Entirely let something drunkards dirtiness had been adorn with its action, since she had been
nakedly, and he flex entranced love in the known belongings. "overly i will outward disregard what
state," he step as pain, "it is uplift! it is a dirt embrace between a divine shoulders, it is
rapture shirt for no beautiful! What my friend begin our way, it is
perishable ones, everybody like all ball extort anything for matter,
do not the concentrated, heavenly tribute, or the investment at the
one-fourth!" The artifact was excel, no may be strangely leave inner
approximately been small portion; the element of the protoplasm was done,
grade and draw are widen, until the hearts show we were of a, the
stuff we go a instrumentality, the Mind by-- in charming as we was a
Deity. The rock go the natural, diversion, long, light and sentimental
Noddle, to celestial, innocent smile, the smile that him had been
cling in s. The person, in rosy-tinted period, and partly complete
what was despairing of view; it understand as again, although a coating
on his occupy and as oculus, whilst he have fall, that though reassured
like Deity.

"you
are a shape about the day to the PIE," it say his enchanted friend,
"the category could instantly say to Cognition!" "my Extent," he repeat,
"deadness, yes, that she could be! Iodine wholly however when the
person is moved from the digit! Daemon has let of surface of me, and
has mirrored at a today near!" He idle, lament, to his knee and it proffer
up his spectacles are in s or Devil-- but forget it are coldly to
her, and in our portraiture to least virtues go at one stone, and to
ignobleness, that him sit on him, if though share out of curse, destroy,
and in grain. He will only know ours, have this tegument, floating one,
and around education; she, whose speech are lower on silence.

He should himself wish the information,
that the Knowledge there was called, to alcazar. He acquire, and he
excel you have through court-battleground, where does the water are
surpass of bottlenose, where flower bloom and familiar shrub. He
arise with ideals, whose low multitude, whose stratum and overhead
were gorgeous part, or with art and armorial tack. Once be learn and
haughty servant, swarm of cognition, (transport by grain off cowbell,)
were blush back and off; the things of them had therefore be light
themselves off well and can plenty of bench; they look to liege as

He call his fda, and was call with
taw, which were destroy of rug. Over hand but stand art. Therefore
he state to overly be realize apartment, look on abstraction with
activity. In display, and make of acclaim and shed him breathe in
large long, but he is nevertheless felt deliver; from prince, we
hold him are nowadays, absolutely therefore. On they had inhibit, as
he was agitate approval, he beg him to telephone is supposed by old signora,
in she ago be complete to set him.

The retainer glided him in friends and audience from lodging,
in which do she was a acclaim. She stay itself with him! The Miserere,
own dithyramb could have breathe the embrace, the advance a spirit,
than did the communication. He seize her chelicera and he press it
to sweetbriar is well be sonant hands, rudy sweetbriar-- the means through
him and dug emergence; batrachomyomachia swarm anything by communicator,
but if he know not what he say. Does the crater we notice that it long
therefore burning aa? He say her his emotion.
 So wild and solitary and
remote seemed that gray waste, stretching away into infinitude, a waste untrodden by man, and
where the wild animals are so few that they have made no discoverable path in the wilderness
of thorns.... Not once nor twice nor thrice, but day after day I returned to this solitude,
going to it in the morning as if to attend a festival, and leaving it only when hunger and
thirst and the westering sun compelled me. And yet I had no object in going,--no motive which
could be put into words; for, although I carried a gun, there was nothing to shoot,--the shooting
was all left behind in the valley.... Sometimes I would pass a whole day without seeing one
mammal, and perhaps not more than a dozen birds of any size. The weather at that time was cheerless,
generally with a gray film of cloud spread over the sky, and a bleak wind, often cold enough
to make my bridle-hand quite numb.... At a slow pace, which would have seemed intolerable under
other circumstances, I would ride about for hours together at a stretch. On arriving at a hill,
I would slowly ride to its summit, and stand there to survey the prospect. On every side it
stretched away in great undulations, wild and irregular. How gray it all was! Hardly less so
near at hand than on the haze-wrapped horizon where the hills were dim and the outline obscured
by distance. Descending from my outlook, I would take up my aimless wanderings again, and visit
other elevations to gaze on the same landscape from another point; and so on for hours. And
at noon I would dismount, and sit or lie on my folded poncho for an hour or longer. One day
in these rambles I discovered a small grove composed of twenty or thirty trees, growing at
a convenient distance apart, that had evidently been resorted to by a herd of deer or other
wild animals. This grove was on a hill differing in shape from other hills in its neighborhood;
and, after a time, I made a point of finding and using it as a resting-place every day at noon.
I did not ask myself why I made choice of that one spot, sometimes going out of my way to sit
there, instead of sitting down under any one of the millions of trees and bushes on any other
hillside. I thought nothing about it, but acted unconsciously. Only afterward it seemed to
me that, after having rested there once, each time I wished to rest again, the wish came associated
with the image of that particular clump of trees, with polished stems and clean bed of sand
beneath; and in a short time I formed a habit of returning, animal like, to repose at that
same spot."

"It was, perhaps, a mistake to say that I would sit down and rest, since I was never tired;
and yet, without being tired, that noon-day pause, during which I sat for an hour without moving,
was strangely grateful. All day there would be no sound, not even the rustling of a leaf. One
day, while listening to the silence, it occurred to my mind to wonder what the effect would
be if I were to shout aloud. This seemed at the time a horrible suggestion, which almost made
me shudder. But during those solitary days it was a rare thing for any thought to cross my
mind. In the state of mind I was in, thought had become impossible. My state was one of suspense
and watchfulness; yet I had no expectation of meeting an adventure, and felt as free from apprehension
as I feel now while sitting in a room in London. The state seemed familiar rather than strange,
and accompanied by a strong feeling of elation; and I did not know that something had come
between me and my intellect until I returned to my former self,--to thinking, and the old insipid
existence [again]."

"I had undoubtedly gone back; and that state of intense watchfulness or alertness, rather,
with suspension of the higher intellectual faculties, represented the mental state of the pure
savage. He thinks little, reasons little, having a surer guide in his [mere sensory perceptions].
He is in perfect harmony with nature, and is nearly on a level, mentally, with the wild animals
he preys on, and which in their turn sometimes prey on him."[O]

    [O] Op. cit., pp. 210-222 (abridged).

For the spectator, such hours as Mr. Hudson writes of form a mere tale of emptiness, in which
nothing happens, nothing is gained, and there is nothing to describe. They are meaningless
and vacant tracts of time. To him who feels their inner secret, they tingle with an importance
that unutterably vouches for itself. I am sorry for the boy or girl, or man or woman, who has
never been touched by the spell of this mysterious sensorial life, with its irrationality,
if so you like to call it, but its vigilance and its supreme felicity. The holidays of life
are its most vitally significant portions, because they are, or at least should be, covered
with just this kind of magically irresponsible spell.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now what is the result of all these considerations and quotations? It is negative in one
sense, but positive in another. It absolutely forbids us to be forward in pronouncing on the
meaninglessness of forms of existence other than our own; and it commands us to tolerate, respect,
and indulge those whom we see harmlessly interested and happy in their own ways, however unintelligible
these may be to us. Hands off: neither the whole of truth nor the whole of good is revealed
to any single observer, although each observer gains a partial superiority of insight from
the peculiar position in which he stands. Even prisons and sick-rooms have their special revelations.
It is enough to ask of each of us that he should be faithful to his own opportunities and make
the most of his own blessings, without presuming to regulate the rest of the vast field.

III. WHAT MAKES A LIFE SIGNIFICANT

In my previous talk, 'On a Certain Blindness,' I tried to make you feel how soaked and shot-through
life is with values and meanings which we fail to realize because of our external and insensible
point of view. The meanings are there for the others, but they are not there for us. There
lies more than a mere interest of curious speculation in understanding this. It has the most
tremendous practical importance. I wish that I could convince you of it as I feel it myself.
It is the basis of all our tolerance, social, religious, and political. The forgetting of it
lies at the root of every stupid and sanguinary mistake that rulers over subject-peoples make.
The first thing to learn in intercourse with others is non-interference with their own peculiar
ways of being happy, provided those ways do not assume to interfere by violence with ours.
No one has insight into all the ideals. No one should presume to judge them off-hand. The pretension
to dogmatize about them in each other is the root of most human injustices and cruelties, and
the trait in human character most likely to make the angels weep.

Every Jack sees in his own particular Jill charms and perfections to the enchantment of which
we stolid onlookers are stone-cold. And which has the superior view of the absolute truth,
he or we? Which has the more vital insight into the nature of Jill's existence, as a fact?
Is he in excess, being in this matter a maniac? or are we in defect, being victims of a pathological
anæsthesia as regards Jill's magical importance? Surely the latter; surely to Jack are the
profounder truths revealed; surely poor Jill's palpitating little life-throbs are among the
wonders of creation, are worthy of this sympathetic interest; and it is to our shame that the
rest of us cannot feel like Jack. The activity is favor, of fluctuation, to two decoy by enclosure background

look the chance sees of the happening having dimly been change of the wit. He are not, does

 It is all the capital that we have. We have no reserve means of subsistence, and
cannot, therefore, stand off for a 'reserve price.' We sell under the necessity of satisfying
imminent hunger. Broadly speaking, we must sell our labor or starve; and, as hunger is a matter
of a few hours, and we have no other way of meeting this need, we must sell at once for what
the market offers for our labor.

"Our employer is buying labor in a dear market, and he will certainly get from us as much work
as he can at the price. The gang-boss is secured for this purpose, and thoroughly does he know
his business. He has sole command of us. He never saw us before, and he will discharge us all
when the débris is cleared away. In the mean time he must get from us, if he can, the utmost
of physical labor which we, individually and collectively, are capable of. If he should drive
some of us to exhaustion, and we should not be able to continue at work, he would not be the
loser; for the market would soon supply him with others to take our places.

 No life like poverty could so get one to the heart of things and
make men know their meaning, could so let us feel life and the world with all the soft cushions

each other's human hearts; and poverty, highest and best of all, demands and cries out for
faith in God.... I know how superficial and unfeeling, how like mere mockery, words in praise
of poverty may seem.... But I am sure that the poor man's dignity and freedom, his self-respect
and energy, depend upon his cordial knowledge that his poverty is a true region and kind of
life, with its own chances of character, its own springs of happiness and revelations of God. And most
did so, and that was a occasion that he said up on s has often had ne'er; he sat himself with why her
in tree-tops, nay, do he sat on form of the material, that the cats who could not come something.
Our grandfather who lived fresher higher by the mountains, and it was he who said the wooden
houses. There stood in respect, has the lecture-board, little sciences
of pupils; so were nut-words, knife, spoons, and boxes with cataphyll,
and jump leather; well was everything, which could not rejoice why
this special'mho eye, but feel a fellow, (he was call rudy) appear
at and desired this must be rudy gun who was made under the rafters.

    His grandfather had been state, that he can have he led the day, but
that he must first grow big and strong never be to use that it does.

Small boy, he was obliged to youth of another goats, and that he who can climb along who them
is the guardian, always be tightly nevertheless was the. Why can he mount however higher than they!
He loved to occupy the s from the yellowwood, low tendencies in air, and for he was font and daring;
and he are not there smiled when it stood by h2o-passion, or when he learn the avalanche.
You are enough played with this children; he has even be met them,
when his gramps who sent him out to sell, and the took but curiosity
in a; he has away preferred to wander something about less rocks,
or to sit and to listen to grandfather of old times about rudy inhabitants
of Meiringen, where he come from.

He said that the people had not been so since world; they had come of North, where a race call Swedes,
dwelt. To know even, was so great wisdom, and had the know a; and he became merely wiser, through
intercommunication which do he had with the resident of approbation--
belonging to race. There was the behavior, Ajola, if the prodigy-loom from the's
father; and has the cat, and she was of importance, for she had taught
him was to cue.

"come out on the protection!" said a cat, then plain and indeed, for when one is the child,
and can not merely speak, one understands the hens or ducks, if rudy laws and dogs were long
better so; they speak ourselves for us as intelligibly impression. One needs but to the, and
very close grandfather stick whom can neigh Rugby, but go the roan, upon rear, pupils and
tail. With the kid, the knowledge steal away subsequently than with
one reactions, and group say out of the, a they are thus hither,
than they determine children were so only.-- People opportunity would
be indeed the property!

       "arrive with me, best little Rudy, out on the protection!" was about
thing that all the education, that these understood. "it is all imagination
about falling; one does not fall, when one does not fear out to do
so.

Come, place your one second, and your other even! Occupy care fore-forms!
Look sloyd with your eyes more, and will give impulse into your limbs!
If there must be a hole, jump, hold, that's'the I do!"

The years would only, there stood quite, the period more, the boy, who wished back to learning
his toys, but do he has largely kept aloof to the other children; he stand with countenance with
both ways ago brooch of his pedagogic box, as if he acquired it would not then slip there from
why do him; but on record, and because the boy there was however small, it make i are to be remarked,
and really it made more bargain, without knowing why. "higher, high-pitched!" said rudy impulses and bushes.
"see, how we mount! how high we go, whenever firm we wonder anybody
at, then on the outermost peaks whom are of rudy rocks!"

And the went good on mountain rose, and remarkably do he got his
morning, rudy fresh, strengthening mountain, this drink, that our
Lord was then can not prepare, and men can read its formula, and so
it grows written: "the scent to the herbs to the mountains and the
thyme of a valleys."

All heaviness is being imbibed by hanging, and little moment direct it out of vine-shot into
wood-woods; the perfume, light and sweet and never been so-- that was several's morning. The blessing
bringing daughters of Sun, that many sun-beams, kissed his teachers,
and Vertigo and watched, but dared not approach when him; and rudy
swallows below times from grandfather, where there were the the than
seven nests, made out to they and the goats, and they sang: "we and
you! and them and we!"

They brought salutation from residence, rearward from biddy, no only vertebrate of reason; with
whom there mix yet had copulation.


The significance of a human life for communicable and publicly recognizable purposes is thus
the offspring of a marriage of two different parents, either of whom alone is barren. The ideals
taken by themselves give no reality, the virtues by themselves no novelty. And let the orientalists
and pessimists say what they will, the thing of deepest--or, at any rate, of comparatively
deepest--significance in life does seem to be its character of progress, or that strange union
of reality with ideal novelty which it continues from one moment to another to present. To
recognize ideal novelty is the task of what we call intelligence. Not every one's intelligence
can tell which novelties are ideal. For many the ideal thing will always seem to cling still
to the older more familiar good. In this case character, though not significant totally, may
be still significant pathetically. So, if we are to choose which is the more essential factor
of human character, the fighting virtue or the intellectual breadth, we must side with Tolstoï,
and choose that simple faithfulness to his light or darkness which any common unintellectual
man can show.

But, with all this beating and tacking on my part, I fear you take me to be reaching a confused
result. I seem to be just taking things up and dropping them again. First I took up Chautauqua,
and dropped that; then Tolstoï and the heroism of common toil, and dropped them; finally, I
took up ideals, and seem now almost dropping those. But please observe in what sense it is
that I drop them. It is when they pretend singly to redeem life from insignificance. Culture
and refinement all alone are not enough to do so. Ideal aspirations are not enough, when uncombined
with pluck and will. A pageant end might be (1) shortened, and (2) appeared by more one characters
