PARIS, August 1835.

THE DESERTED WOMAN

In the early spring of 1822, the Paris doctors sent to Lower Normandy a young man just recovering
from an inflammatory complaint, brought on by overstudy, or perhaps by excess of some other
kind. His convalescence demanded complete rest, a light diet, bracing air, and freedom from
excitement of every kind, and the fat lands of Bessin seemed to offer all these conditions
of recovery. To Bayeux, a picturesque place about six miles from the sea, the patient therefore
betook himself, and was received with the cordiality characteristic of relatives who lead very
retired lives, and regard a new arrival as a godsend.

 She was
believed to be extremely clever. But if men and women of parts may be captivated by something
subtle or eccentric, they are also exacting, and can read all that lies below the surface;
and after the first step has been taken, the chances of failure and success in the difficult
task of pleasing them are about even. In this particular case, moreover, the Vicomtesse, besides
the pride of her position, had all the dignity of her name. Her utter seclusion was the least
of the barriers raised between her and the world. For which reasons it was well-nigh impossible
that a stranger, however well born, could hope for admittance; and yet, the next morning found
M. de Nueil taking his walks abroad in the direction of Courcelles, a dupe of illusions natural
at his age. Several times he made the circuit of the garden walls, looking earnestly through
every gap at the closed shutters or open windows, hoping for some romantic chance, on which
he founded schemes for introducing himself into this unknown lady's presence, without a thought
of their impracticability. Morning after morning was spent in this way to mighty purpose; but
with each day's walk, that vision of a woman living apart from the world, of love's martyr
buried in solitude, loomed larger in his thoughts, and was enshrined in his soul. So Gaston
de Nueil walked under the walls of Courcelles, and some gardener's heavy footstep would set
his heart beating high with hope.

He thought of writing to Mme. de Beauseant, but on mature consideration, what can you say to
a woman whom you have never seen, a complete stranger? And Gaston had little self-confidence.
Like most young persons with a plentiful crop of illusions still standing, he dreaded the mortifying
contempt of silence more than death itself, and shuddered at the thought of sending his first
tender epistle forth to face so many chances of being thrown on the fire. He was distracted
by innumerable conflicting ideas. But by dint of inventing chimeras, weaving romances, and
cudgeling his brains, he hit at last upon one of the hopeful stratagems that are sure to occur
to your mind if you persevere long enough, a stratagem which must make clear to the most inexperienced
woman that here was a man who took a fervent interest in her. The caprice of social conventions
puts as many barriers between lovers as any Oriental imagination can devise in the most delightfully
fantastic tale; indeed, the most extravagant pictures are seldom exaggerations. In real life,
as in the fairy tales, the woman belongs to him who can reach her and set her free from the
position in which she languishes. The poorest of calenders that ever fell in love with the
daughter of the Khalif is in truth scarcely further from his lady than Gaston de Nueil from
Mme. de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse knew absolutely nothing of M. de Nueil's wanderings round
her house; Gaston de Nueil's love grew to the height of the obstacles to overleap; and the
distance set between him and his extemporized lady-love produced the usual effect of distance,
in lending enchantment.

One day, confident in his inspiration, he hoped everything from the love that must pour forth
from his eyes. Spoken words, in his opinion, were more eloquent than the most passionate letter;
and, besides, he would engage feminine curiosity to plead for him. He went, therefore, to M.
de Champignelles, proposing to employ that gentleman for the better success of his enterprise.
He informed the Marquis that he had been entrusted with a delicate and important commission
which concerned the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, that he felt doubtful whether she would read a
letter written in an unknown handwriting, or put confidence in a stranger. Would M. de Champignelles,
on his next visit, ask the Vicomtesse if she would consent to receive him--Gaston de Nueil?
While he asked the Marquis to keep his secret in case of a refusal, he very ingeniously insinuated
sufficient reasons for his own admittance, to be duly passed on to the Vicomtesse. Was not
M. de Champignelles a man of honor, a loyal gentleman incapable of lending himself to any transaction
in bad taste, nay, the merest suspicion of bad taste! Love lends a young man all the self-possession
and astute craft of an old ambassador; all the Marquis' harmless vanities were gratified, and
the haughty grandee was completely duped. He tried hard to fathom Gaston's secret; but the
latter, who would have been greatly perplexed to tell it, turned off M. de Champignelles' adroit
questioning with a Norman's shrewdness, till the Marquis, as a gallant Frenchman, complimented
his young visitor upon his discretion.

M. de Champignelles hurried off at once to Courcelles, with that eagerness to serve a pretty
woman which belongs to his time of life. In the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's position, such a
message was likely to arouse keen curiosity; so, although her memory supplied no reason at
all that could bring M. de Nueil to her house, she saw no objection to his visit--after some
prudent inquiries as to his family and condition. At the same time, she began by a refusal.
Then she discussed the propriety of the matter with M. de Champignelles, directing her questions
so as to discover, if possible, whether he knew the motives for the visit, and finally revoked
her negative answer. The discussion and the discretion shown perforce by the Marquis had piqued
her curiosity.

M. de Champignelles had no mind to cut a ridiculous figure. 've bag, beyond one man.'. "" so, i

And yet, in spite of himself, he broke the silence to say in a faltering voice:

"Madame, permit me to give way to one of the strongest emotions of my life, and own to all
that you have made me feel. You set the heart in me swelling high! I feel within me a longing
to make you forget your mortifications, to devote my life to this, to give you love for all
who ever have given you wounds or hate. But this is a very sudden outpouring of the heart,
nothing can justify it to-day, and I ought not----"

"Enough, monsieur," said Mme. de Beauseant; "we have both of us gone too far. By giving you
the sad reasons for a refusal which I am compelled to give, I meant to soften it and not to
elicit homage. Coquetry only suits a happy woman. Believe me, we must remain strangers to each
other. At a later day you will know that ties which must inevitably be broken ought not to
be formed at all."

She sighed lightly, and her brows contracted, but almost immediately grew clear again.

"How painful it is for a woman to be powerless to follow the man she loves through all the
phases of his life! And if that man loves her truly, his heart must surely vibrate with pain
to the deep trouble in hers. Are they not twice unhappy?"

There was a short pause. Then she rose smiling.

"You little suspected, when you came to Courcelles, that you were to hear a sermon, did you?"

Gaston felt even further than at first from this extraordinary woman. Was the charm of that
delightful hour due after all to the coquetry of the mistress of the house? She had been anxious
to display her wit. He bowed stiffly to the Vicomtesse, and went away in desperation.

   I cannot imagine life without

  limits save by opposing to it something as infinite? Yet, if you
  will allow me to hope, not to be yours, but to win your
  friendship, I will stay. Let me come, not so very often, if you
  require it, to spend a few such hours with you as those stolen
  hours of yesterday. The keen delight of that brief happiness to be
  cut short at the least over-ardent word from me, will suffice to
  enable me to endure the boiling torrent in my veins. Have I
  presumed too much upon your generosity by this entreaty to suffer
  an intercourse in which all the gain is mine alone? You could find
  ways of showing the world, to which you sacrifice so much, that I
  am nothing to you; you are so clever and so proud! What have you
  to fear? If I could only lay bare my heart to you at this moment,
  to convince you that it is with no lurking afterthought that I
  make this humble request! Should I have told you that my love was
  boundless, while I prayed you to grant me friendship, if I had any
  hope of your sharing this feeling in the depths of my soul? No,
  while I am with you, I will be whatever you will, if only I may be
  with you. If you refuse (as you have the power to refuse), I will
  not utter one murmur, I will go. And if, at a later day, any other
  woman should enter into my life, you will have proof that you were
  right; but if I am faithful till death, you may feel some regret
  perhaps. The hope of causing you a regret will soothe my agony,
  and that thought shall be the sole revenge of a slighted
  heart...."

Only those who have passed through all the exceeding tribulations of youth, who have seized
on all the chimeras with two white pinions, the nightmare fancies at the disposal of a fervid
imagination, can realize the horrors that seized upon Gaston de Nueil when he had reason to
suppose that his ultimatum was in Mme. de Beauseant's hands. He saw the Vicomtesse, wholly
untouched, laughing at his letter and his love, as those can laugh who have ceased to believe
in love. He could have wished to have his letter back again. It was an absurd letter. There
were a thousand and one things, now that he came to think of it, that he might have said, things
infinitely better and more moving than those stilted phrases of his, those accursed, sophisticated,
pretentious, fine-spun phrases, though, luckily, the punctuation had been pretty bad and the
lines shockingly crooked. He tried not to think, not to feel; but he felt and thought, and
was wretched. If he had been thirty years old, he might have got drunk, but the innocence of
three-and-twenty knew nothing of the resources of opium nor of the expedients of advanced civilization.
Nor had he at hand one of those good friends of the Parisian pattern who understand so well
