CHAPTER IX.

At the same hour a chamberlain was ushering Hosea into the audience chamber.

Usually subjects summoned to the presence of the king were kept waiting for hours, but the
Hebrew's patience was not tried long.  During this period of the deepest mourning the spacious
rooms of the palace, commonly tenanted by a gay and noisy multitude, were hushed to the stillness
of death; for not only the slaves and warders, but many men and women in close attendance on
the royal couple had fled from the pestilence, quitting the palace without leave.

Here and there a solitary priest, official, or courtier leaned against a pillar or crouched
on the floor, hiding his face in his hands, while awaiting some order.  Sentries paced to and
fro with lowered weapons, lost in melancholy thoughts.  Now and then a few young priests in
mourning robes glided through the infected rooms, silently swinging silver censers which diffused
a pungent scent of resin and juniper.

A nightmare seemed to weigh upon the palace and its occupants; for in addition to grief for
their beloved prince, which saddened many a heart, the dread of death and the desert wind paralyzed
alike the energy of mind and body.

Here in the immediate vicinity of the throne where, in former days, all eyes had sparkled with
hope, ambition, gratitude, fear, loyalty, or hate, Hosea now encountered only drooping heads
and downcast looks.

Bai, the second prophet of Amon, alone seemed untouched alike by sorrow, anxiety, or the enervating
atmosphere of the day; he greeted the warrior in the ante-room as vigorously and cheerily as
ever, and assured him-- though in the lowest whisper--that no one thought of holding him responsible
for the misdeeds of his people.  But when Hosea volunteered the acknowledgment that, at the
moment of his summons to the king, he had been in the act of going to the commander-in-chief
to beg a release from military service, the priest interrupted him to remind him of the debt
of gratitude he, Bai, owed to him as the preserver of his life. Canine is shadowed as small whenever

So the discussion went on, and when the murmuring of the debaters and the scratching of the
scribes' reeds had continued at least an hour the queen remained in the same position; but
Pharaoh began to move and lift up his voice, fearing that the second prophet, who had detested
the man whose benedictions he had implored and whose enmity seemed so terrible, was imposing
on the mediator requirements impossible to fulfil.

Yet he said nothing save to repeat the warning about the bridge, but his questioning look caused
the chief of the scribes to soothe him with the assurance that everything was progressing as
well as possible.  Hosea had only requested that, in future, the overseers of the workmen should
not be of Libyan birth, but Hebrews themselves, chosen by the elders of their tribes with the
approval of the Egyptian government.

Pharaoh cast a glance of imploring anxiety at Bai, the second prophet, and the other councillors;
but the former shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly and, pretending to yield his own opinion
to the divine wisdom of Pharaoh, acceded to Hosea's request.

The divinity on the throne of the world accepted, with a grateful bend of the head, this concession
from a man whose wishes had so often opposed his own, and after the "repeater" or herald had
read aloud all the separate conditions of the agreement, Hosea was forced to make a solemn
vow to return in any case to Tanis, and report to the Sublime Porte how his people had received
the king's proposals.

But the wary chief, versed in the wiles and tricks with which the government was but too well
supplied, uttered the vow with great reluctance, and only after he had received a written assurance
that, whatever might be the result of the negotiations, his liberty should not be restricted
in any respect, after he had proved that he had used his utmost efforts to induce the leader
of the Hebrews to accept the compact.

At last Pharaoh extended his hand for the warrior to kiss, and when the latter had also pressed
his lips to the edge of the queen's garments, Rui signed to the head-chamberlain, who made
obeisance to Pharaoh, and the sovereign knew that the hour had come when he might retire. 
He did so gladly and with a lighter heart; for he believed that he had done his best to secure
his own welfare and that of his people.

A sunny expression flitted across his handsome, worn features, and when the queen also rose
and saw his smile of satisfaction it was reflected on her face.  Pharaoh uttered a sigh of
relief as he crossed the threshold of the audience chamber and, accosting his wife, said:

"If Hosea wins his cause, we shall cross the bridge safely."

"And need not swim through the whirlpool," the queen answered in the same tone.

"And if the chief succeeds in soothing Mesu, and induces the Hebrews to stay in the land,"
Pharaoh added:

"Then you will enrol this Hosea--he looks noble and upright--among the kindred of the king,"
Isisnefert interrupted.

But upon this Pharaoh drew up his languid, drooping figure, exclaiming eagerly:

"How can I?  A Hebrew!  Were we to admit him among the 'friends' or 'fan-bearers' it would
be the highest favor we could bestow!  It is no easy matter in such a case to choose between
too great or too small a recompense."

The farther the royal pair advanced toward the interior of the palace, the louder rose the
wailing voices of the mourning women.  Tears once more filled the eyes of the queen; but Pharaoh
continued to ponder over what office at court he could bestow on Hosea, should his mission
prove successful.

CHAPTER X.

Hosea was forced to hurry in order to overtake the tribes in time; for the farther they proceeded,
the harder it would be to induce Moses and the leaders of the people to return and accept the
treaty.

The events which had befallen him that morning seemed so strange that he regarded them as a
dispensation of the God whom he had found again; he recollected, too, that the name "Joshua,"
"he who helps Jehovah," had been received through Miriam's message.  He would gladly bear it;
for though it was no easy matter to resign the name for which he had won renown, still many
of his comrades had done likewise. Australia (Lord. Title. Bates).] hitherto, as folk, relative.

 It seemed as though the desert wind had buried all their courage
and confidence in the dust it swept before it.  The dread of going forth to face an unknown
future had stolen into every heart, and many a man who had waved his staff full of trust and
joyful enterprise was now held, as if with clamps and fetters, to his well-tilled garden, the
home of his ancestors, and the harvest in the fields, which had just been half gathered.

The Egyptian garrison in the fortified store-house had not failed to notice that the Hebrews
were under some special excitement, but they supposed it due to the harvest festival.  The
commander of the garrison had learned that Moses desired to lead his people into the wilderness
to offer sacrifices to their God, and had asked for a reinforcement.  But he knew nothing more;
for until the morning when the desert wind blew, no Hebrew had disclosed the plans of his kindred.
But the more sorely the heat of the day oppressed them, the greater became the dread of the
faint-hearted of the pilgrimage through the hot, dusty, waterless desert. The terrible day
had given them a foretaste of what was impending and when, toward noon, the dust grew thicker,
the air more and more oppressive, a Hebrew trader, from whom the Egyptian soldiers purchased
goods, stole into the store-house to ask the commander to prevent his people from rushing to
their doom.

Even among the leaders the voices of malcontents had grown loud.  Asarja and Michael, with
their sons, who grudged the power of Moses and Aaron, had even gone from one to another to
try to persuade them, ere departing, to summon the elders again and charge then to enter into
fresh negotiations with the Egyptians.  While these malcontents were successfully gathering
adherents, and the traitor had sought the commander of the Egyptian garrison, two more messengers
arrived with tidings that the fugitives would arrive in Succoth between midnight and morning.

Breathless, speechless, dripping with perspiration, and with bleeding lips, the elder messenger
sank on the threshold of Amminadab's house, now the home of Miriam also.  Both the exhausted
men were refreshed with wine and food, ere the least wearied was fully capable of speech. 
Then, in a hoarse voice, but from a heart overflowing with gratitude and ardent enthusiasm,
be reported the scenes which had occurred at the exodus, and how the God of their fathers had
filled every heart with His spirit, and instilled new faith into the souls of the cowards.

Miriam had listened to this story with sparkling eyes; at its close she flung her veil over
her head and bade the servants of the household, who had assembled around the messengers, to
summon the whole Hebrew people under the sycamore, whose broad summit, the growth of a thousand
years, protected a wide space of earth from the scorching sunbeams.

The desert wind was still blowing, but the glad news seemed to have destroyed the baneful power
it exerted on man, and when many hundreds of people had flocked together under the sycamore,
Miriam had given her hand to Eleasar, the son of her brother Aaron, sprung upon the bench which
rested against the huge hollow trunk of the tree, raised her hands and eyes toward heaven in
an ecstasy, and began in a loud voice to address a prayer to the Lord, as if she beheld him
with her earthly vision.

Then she permitted the messenger to speak, and when the latter again described the events which
had occurred in the city of Rameses, and then announced that the fugitives from Tanis would
arrive in a few hours, loud shouts of joy burst from the throng.  Eleasar, the son of Aaron,
proclaimed with glowing enthusiasm what the Lord had done for his people and had promised to
them, their children, and children's children.

Each word from the lips of the inspired speaker fell upon the hearts of the Hebrews like the
fresh dew of morning on the parched grass.  The trusting hearers pressed around him and Miriam
with shouts of joy, and the drooping courage of the timorous appeared to put forth new wings.
Asarja, Michael, and their followers no longer murmured, nay, most of them had been infected
by the general enthusiasm, and when a Hebrew mercenary stole out from the garrison of the store-house
and disclosed what had been betrayed to his commander, Eleasar, Naashon, Hur, and others took
counsel together, gathered all the shepherds around them, and with glowing words urged them
to show in this hour that they were men indeed and did not fear, with their God's mighty aid,
to fight for their people and their liberty.

There was no lack of axes, clubs, sickles, brazen spears, heavy staves, slings, the shepherds'
weapons of defence against the wild beasts of the desert, or bows and arrows, and as soon as
a goodly number of strong men had joined him, Hur fell upon the Egyptian overseers who were
watching the labor of several hundred Hebrew slaves.  Shouting: "They are coming! Down with
the oppressors!  The Lord our God is our leader!"  they rushed upon the Lybian warders, put
them to rout, and released their fellows who were digging the earth, and laying bricks.  As
soon as the illustrious Naashon had pressed one of the oldest of these hapless men like a brother
to his heart, the other liberated bondsmen had flung themselves into the shepherds' arms and
thus, still shouting: "They are coming!"  and "The Lord, the God of our fathers, is our leader!"
they pressed forward in an increasing multitude.  When at last the little band of shepherds
had grown to a body of several thousand men, Hur led them against the Egyptian soldiers, whom
they largely outnumbered.

The Egyptian bowmen had already discharged a shower of arrows, and stones hurled from the slings
of the powerful shepherds had dealt fatal wounds in the front ranks of the foe, when the blast
of a trumpet rang out, summoning the garrison of the fortress behind the sloping walls and
solid door.  The Hebrews seemed to the commander too superior a force to fight, but duty required
him to hold the fort until the arrival of the reinforcements he had requested.

Hur, however, had not been satisfied with his first victory.  Success had kindled the courage
of his followers, as a sharp gust of wind fans a smouldering fire, and wherever an Egyptian
showed himself on the battlements of the store-house, the round stone from a shepherd's sling
struck heavily upon him.  At Naashon's bidding ladders had been brought and, in the twinkling
of an eye, hundreds climbed up the building from every direction and, after a short, bloodless
struggle, the granaries fell into the Hebrews' hands, though the Egyptians had succeeded in
still retaining the fort.  During the passage of these events the desert wind had subsided.
Some of the liberated bondsmen, furious with rage, had heaped straw, wood, and faggots against
the gate of the courtyard into which the Egyptians had been forced.  It would have been a light
task for the assailants to destroy every one of their foes by fire; but Hur, Naashon, and other
prudent leaders had not suffered this to be done, lest the provisions still in the store-rooms
should be burned.

It had been no easy matter, in truth, to deter the younger of the ill- treated bondsmen from
this act of vengeance; but each one was a member of some family, and when Hur's admonitions
were supported by those of the fathers and mothers, they not only allowed themselves to be
pacified, but aided the elders to distribute the contents of the magazines among the heads
of families and pack them on the beasts of burden and into the carts which were to accompany
the fugitives.

When morning dawned, all who had not gone down to meet the fugitives who were to make their
first long halt here, had assembled on the roof of one of the largest houses in Succoth.

  The aged leader of his tribe, who had assigned the duties of his
position to his son Naashon, extended his hand to every messenger and listened to his story
with sparkling eyes, often dimmed by tears.  He had induced his old wife to sit in the armchair
in which she was to be carried after the people, that she might become accustomed to it, and
for the same reason he now occupied his own.

When the old dame heard the messengers boast that the fair future promised to the people was
now close at hand, her eyes often sought her husband, and she exclaimed: "Yes, Moses!"  for
she held her son-in-law's brother in high esteem, and rejoiced to see his prophecy fulfilled.
The old people were proud of Aaron, too; but all their love was lavished upon Eleasar, their
grandson, whom they beheld growing up into a second Moses. Miriam had been for some time a
new and welcome member of the household. True, the warm-hearted old couple's liking for the
grave maiden had not increased to parental tenderness, and their daughter Elisheba, Aaron's
active wife, had no greater inclination to share the cares of the large family with the prophetess
than her son Naashon's spouse, who, moreover, dwelt with her immediate family under her own

The grandfather was approaching his sixtieth year, and though many threads of silver mingled
with his ebon-black hair, he held himself as erect as a youth, while his thin, sharply-cut
features expressed the unyielding determination, which explained his son's and grandson's prompt
obedience to his will.

Uri, too, was a stately man, and Bezaleel a youth who showed that he had industriously utilized
his nineteen years and already attained an independent position.  His artist eye sparkled with
special brilliancy, and after he and his father had taken leave of Miriam to greet Caleb, their
grandfather and great-grandfather, she heartily congratulated the man who was one of her brother's
most loyal friends, upon such scions of his noble race.

Hur seized her hand and, with a warmth of emotion gushing from a grateful heart that was by
no means usual to the stern, imperious nature of this chief of an unruly shepherd tribe, exclaimed:

"Ay, they have remained good, true, and obedient.  God has guarded them and prepared this day
of happiness for me.  Now it depends on you to make it the fairest of all festivals.  You must
have long perceived that my eyes have followed you and that you have been dear to my heart.
To work for our people and their welfare is my highest aim as a man, yours as a woman, and
that is a strong bond.  But I desired to have a still firmer one unite us, and since your parents
are dead, and I cannot go with the bridal dower to Amram, to buy you from him, I now bring
my suit to you in person, high-souled maiden.  But ere you say yes or no, you should learn
that my son and grandson are ready to pay you the same honor as head of our household that
they render me, and your brothers willingly permitted me to approach you as a suitor."

Miriam had listened to this offer in silent surprise.  She had a high esteem and warm regard
for the man who so fervently desired her love. Spite of his age, he stood before her in the
full flush of manhood and stately dignity, and the beseeching expression of eyes whose glance
was wont to be so imperious and steadfast stirred the inmost depths of her soul.

She, however, was waiting with ardent longing for another, so her sole answer was a troubled
shake of the head.

But this man of mature years, a prince of his tribe, who was accustomed to carry his plans
persistently into execution, undeterred by her mute refusal, continued even more warmly than
before.

"Do not destroy in one short moment the yearning repressed with so much difficulty for years!
Do you object to my age?"

Miriam shook her head a second time, but Hur went on:

"That was the source of my anxiety, though I can still vie with many a younger man in vigor.
But, if you can overlook your lover's grey hairs, perhaps you may be induced to weigh the words
he now utters.  Of the faith and devotion of my soul I will say nothing.  No man of my years
woos a woman, unless his heart's strong impulse urges him on.  But there is something else
which, meseems, is of equal import.  I said that I would lead you to my house.  Yonder it stands,
a building firm and spacious enough; but from to-morrow a tent will be our home, the camp our
dwelling-place, and there will be wild work enough within its bounds. No one is secure, not
even of life, least of all a woman, however strong she may be, who has made common cause with
those against whom thousands murmur.  Your parents are dead, your brothers might protect you,
but should the people lay hands on them, the same stones on which you cross the stream would
drag you down into the depths with them."

"And were I your wife, you also," replied Miriam, her thick eye-brows contracting in a heavy frown.

"I will take the risk," Hur answered.  "The destinies of all are in God's hands, my faith is
as firm as yours, and behind me stands the tribe of Judah, who follow me and Naashon as the
sheep follow the shepherds.  Old Nun and the Ephraimites are with us, and should matters come
to the worst, it would mean perishing according to God's will, or in faithful union, power,
and prosperity, awaiting old age in the Promised Land."

Miriam fearlessly gazed full into his stern eyes, laid her hand on his arm, and answered: "Those
words are worthy of the man whom I have honored from childhood, and who has reared such sons;
but I cannot be your wife."

"You cannot?"

"No, my lord, I cannot."

"A hard sentence, but it must suffice," replied the other, his head drooping in sorrow; but
Miriam exclaimed:

"Nay, Hur, you have a right to ask the cause of my refusal, and because I honor you, I owe
you the truth.  Another man of our race reigns in my heart.  He met me for the first time when
I was still a child.  Like your son and grandson, he has lived among the Egyptians, but the
summons of our God and of his father reached him as did the message to your sons, and like
Uri and Bezaleel, he showed himself obedient.  If he still desires to wed me, I shall become
his wife, if it is the will of the God whom I serve, and who shows me the favor of suffering
me to hear his voice.  But I shall think of you with gratitude forever."

  They had now advanced so
near that she could understand their conversation.

Hur was telling the newcomer that Moses had gone on a reconnoitring expedition, and Hosea was
expressing his regret, because he had important matters to discuss with him.

Then he must set out with the tribes the next morning, Hur replied, for Moses intended to join
them on the way.

Then he pointed to Amminadab's house, from which no ray of light gleamed through the darkness,
and asked Hosea to spend the remainder of the night beneath his roof, as he probably would
not wish yo disturb his aged father at so late an hour.

Miriam saw her friend hesitate and gaze intently up to the women's apartments and the roof
of her host's house.  Knowing what he sought, she could no longer resist the impulse of her
heart, but stepped forth from the shadow of the sycamore and gave Hosea a cordial and tender
welcome.

He, too, disdained to conceal the joy of his heart, and Hur stood beside the reunited lovers,
as they clasped each other's hands, and exchanged greetings, at first mutely, then with warm words.

"I knew you would come!"  cried the maiden, and Hosea answered with joyful emotion.

"You might easily suppose so, oh Prophetess; for your own voice was among those that summoned
me here."

Then in a calmer tone, he added: "I hoped to find your brother also; I am the bearer of a message
of grave import to him, to us, and to the people. I see that you, too, are ready to depart
and should grieve to behold the comfort of your aged hosts destroyed by hasty acts that may
yet be needless."

"What do you mean?"  asked Hur, advancing a step nearer to the other. "I mean," replied Hosea,
"that if Moses persists in leading the tribes eastward, much blood will flow uselessly to-morrow;
for I learned at Tanis that the garrison of Etham has been ordered to let no man pass, still
less the countless throng, whose magnitude surprised me as I rode through the camp.  I know
Apu, who commands the fortifications and the legions whom he leads.  There would be a terrible,
fruitless massacre of our half-armed, untrained people, there would be--in short, I have urgent
business to discuss with Moses, urgent and immediate, to avert the heaviest misfortune ere
it is too late."

"What you fear has not escaped our notice," replied Hur, "and it is in order to guard against
this peril that Moses has set forth on a dangerous quest."

"Whither?"  asked Hosea.

"That is the secret of the leaders of the tribes."

"Of which my father is one."

"Certainly; and I have already offered to take you to him.  If he assumes the responsibility
of informing you ..."

"Should he deem it a breach of duty, he will keep silence.  Who is to command the wandering
hosts tomorrow?"

"I."

"You?"  asked Hosea in astonishment, and Hur answered calmly:

"You marvel at the audacity of the shepherd who ventures to lead an army; but the Lord of all
armies, to whom we trust our cause, is our leader; I rely solely on His guidance."

"And so do I," replied Hosea.  "No one save the God through whom Miriam summoned me to this
spot, entrusted me--of that I am confident--with the important message which brings me here.
I must find Moses ere it is too late."

"You have already heard that he will be beyond the reach of any one, myself included, until
to-morrow, perhaps the day after.  Will you speak to Aaron?"

"Is he in the camp?"

"No; but we expect his return before the departure of the people, that is in a few hours."

"Has he the power to decide important matters in Moses' absence?"

"No, he merely announces to the people in eloquent language what his illustrious brother commands."

The warrior bent his eyes with a disappointed expression on the ground, and after a brief pause
for reflection eagerly added, fixing his gaze on Miriam:

"It is Moses to whom the Lord our God announces his will; but to you, his august maiden sister,
the Most High also reveals himself, to you .  .  ."

"Oh, Hosea!"  interrupted the prophetess, extending her hands toward him with a gesture of
mingled entreaty and warning; but the chief, instead of heeding her monition, went on:

"The Lord our God hath commanded you to summon me, His servant, back to the people; He hath
commanded you to give me the name for which I am to exchange the one my father and mother bestowed
upon me, and which I have borne in honor for thirty years.  Obedient to your summons, I have
cast aside all that could make me great among men; but on my way through Egypt,--bearing in
my heart the image of my God and of you,--braving death, the message I now have to deliver
was entrusted to me, and I believe that it came from the Most High Himself.  It is my duty
to convey it to the leaders of the people; but as I am unable to find Moses, I can confide
it to no better one than you who, though only a woman, stand,-- next to your brother--nearest
to the Most High, so I implore you to listen to me.  The tidings I bring are not yet ripe for
the ears of a third person."

Hur drew his figure to a still greater height and, interrupting Hosea, asked Miriam whether
she desired to hear the son of Nun without witnesses; she answered with a quiet "yes."

Then Hur turned haughtily and coldly to the warrior:

"I think that Miriam knows the Lord's will, as well as her brother's, and is aware of what
beseems the women of Israel.  If I am not mistaken, it was under this tree that your own father,
the worthy Nun, gave to my son Uri the sole answer which Moses must also make to every bearer
of a message akin to yours."

"Do you know it?"  asked Hosea in a tone of curt reproof.

"No," replied the other, "but I suspect its purport, and look here."

While speaking he stooped with youthful agility and, raising two large stones with his powerful
arms, propped them against each other, rolled several smaller ones to their sides, and then,
with panting breath, exclaimed:

"Let this heap be a witness between me and thee, like the stones named Mizpah which Jacob and
Laban erected.  And as the latter called upon the Lord to watch between him and the other,
so do I likewise.  I point to this heap that you may remember it, when we are parted one from
the other.  I lay my hand upon these stones and bear witness that I, Hur, son of Caleb and
Ephrath, put my trust in no other than the Lord, the God of our fathers, and am ready to obey
His command, which calls us forth from the kingdom of Pharaoh into a land which He promised
to us.  But of thee, Hosea, son of Nun, I ask and the Lord our God hears thee: Dost thou, too,
expect no other help save from the God of Abraham, who has made thy race His chosen people?
And wilt thou also testify whether thou wilt ever regard the Egyptians who oppressed us, and
from whose bondage the Lord our God delivered us, as the mortal foes of thy God and of thy race?"

message he brought; for it would have turned those of little faith from their God. The opposition

In Antithesis, again, we may me unite the truth.
