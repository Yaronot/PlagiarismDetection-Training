But it must not be forgotten that we were on our way to Baddeck; that the whole purpose of
the journey was to reach Baddeck; that St. John was only an incident in the trip; that any
information about St. John, which is here thrown in or mercifully withheld, is entirely gratuitous,
and is not taken into account in the price the reader pays for this volume. But if any one
wants to know what sort of a place St. John is, we can tell him: it is the sort of a place
that if you get into it after eight o'clock on Wednesday morning, you cannot get out of it
in any direction until Thursday morning at eight o'clock, unless you want to smuggle goods
on the night train to Bangor. It was eleven o'clock Wednesday forenoon when we arrived at St.
John. The Intercolonial railway train had gone to Shediac; it had gone also on its roundabout
Moncton, Missaquat River, Truro, Stewiack, and Shubenacadie way to Halifax; the boat had gone
to Digby Gut and Annapolis to catch the train that way for Halifax; the boat had gone up the
river to Frederick, the capital. We could go to none of these places till the next day. We
had no desire to go to Frederick, but we made the fact that we were cut off from it an addition
to our injury. The people of St. John have this peculiarity: they never start to go anywhere
except early in the morning.

The reader to whom time is nothing does not yet appreciate the annoyance of our situation.
Our time was strictly limited. The active world is so constituted that it could not spare us
more than two weeks. We must reach Baddeck Saturday night or never. To go home without seeing
Baddeck was simply intolerable. Had we not told everybody that we were going to Baddeck? Now,
if we had gone to Shediac in the train that left St. John that morning, we should have taken
the steamboat that would have carried us to Port Hawkesbury, whence a stage connected with
a steamboat on the Bras d'Or, which (with all this profusion of relative pronouns) would land
us at Baddeck on Friday. How many times had we been over this route on the map and the prospectus
of travel! And now, what a delusion it seemed! There would not another boat leave Shediac on
this route till the following Tuesday,--quite too late for our purpose. The reader sees where
we were, and will be prepared, if he has a map (and any feelings), to appreciate the masterly
strategy that followed.

     During the pilgrimage everything does not suit the tastes of
     the pilgrim.--TURKISH PROVERB.

One seeking Baddeck, as a possession, would not like to be detained a prisoner even in Eden,--much
less in St. John, which is unlike Eden in several important respects. The tree of knowledge
does not grow there, for one thing; at least St. John's ignorance of Baddeck amounts to a feature.
This encountered us everywhere. So dense was this ignorance, that we, whose only knowledge
of the desired place was obtained from the prospectus of travel, came to regard ourselves as
missionaries of geographical information in this dark provincial city.

The clerk at the Victoria was not unwilling to help us on our journey, but if he could have
had his way, we would have gone to a place on Prince Edward Island which used to be called
Bedeque, but is now named Summerside, in the hope of attracting summer visitors. As to Cape
Breton, he said the agent of the Intercolonial could tell us all about that, and put us on
the route. We repaired to the agent. The kindness of this person dwells in our memory. He entered
at once into our longings and perplexities. He produced his maps and time-tables, and showed
us clearly what we already knew. It will be remarked that this idea contains all the environment in high.

and the rock backstairs giving access to these dry stories. An heating apparatus is every same

 Whether it is the fashionable and favorite resort of the dead of the city
we did not learn, but there were some old men sitting in its damp shades, and the nurses appeared
to make it a rendezvous for their baby-carriages,--a cheerful place to bring up children in,
and to familiarize their infant minds with the fleeting nature of provincial life. The park
and burying-ground, it is scarcely necessary to say, added greatly to the feeling of repose
which stole over us on this sunny day. And they made us long for Brown and his information
about Baddeck.

But Mr. Brown, when found, did not know as much as the agent. He had been in Nova Scotia; he
had never been in Cape Breton; but he presumed we would find no difficulty in reaching Baddeck
by so and so, and so and so. We consumed valuable time in convincing Brown that his directions
to us were impracticable and valueless, and then he referred us to Mr. Cope. An interview with
Mr. Cope discouraged us; we found that we were imparting everywhere more geographical information
than we were receiving, and as our own stock was small, we concluded that we should be unable
to enlighten all the inhabitants of St. John upon the subject of Baddeck before we ran out.
Returning to the hotel, and taking our destiny into our own hands, we resolved upon a bold stroke.

But to return for a moment to Brown. I feel that Brown has been let off too easily in the above
paragraph. His conduct, to say the truth, was not such as we expected of a man in whom we had
put our entire faith for half a day,--a long while to trust anybody in these times,--a man
whom we had exalted as an encyclopedia of information, and idealized in every way. A man of
wealth and liberal views and courtly manners we had decided Brown would be. Perhaps he had
a suburban villa on the heights over-looking Kennebeckasis Bay, and, recognizing us as brothers
in a common interest in Baddeck, not-withstanding our different nationality, would insist upon
taking us to his house, to sip provincial tea with Mrs. Brown and Victoria Louise, his daughter.
When, therefore, Mr. Brown whisked into his dingy office, and, but for our importunity, would
have paid no more attention to us than to up-country customers without credit, and when he
proved to be willingly, it seemed to us, ignorant of Baddeck, our feelings received a great
shock. It is incomprehensible that a man in the position of Brown with so many boxes of soap
and candles to dispose of--should be so ignorant of a neighboring province. We had heard of
the cordial unity of the Provinces in the New Dominion. Heaven help it, if it depends upon
such fellows as Brown! Of course, his directing us to Cope was a mere fetch. For as we have
intimated, it would have taken us longer to have given Cope an idea of Baddeck, than it did
to enlighten Brown. But we had no bitter feelings about Cope, for we never had reposed confidence
in him.

Our plan of campaign was briefly this: To take the steamboat at eight o'clock, Thursday morning,
for Digby Gut and Annapolis; thence to go by rail through the poetical Acadia down to Halifax;
to turn north and east by rail from Halifax to New Glasgow, and from thence to push on by stage
to the Gut of Canso. This would carry us over the entire length of Nova Scotia, and, with good
luck, land us on Cape Breton Island Saturday morning. When we should set foot on that island,
we trusted that we should be able to make our way to Baddeck, by walking, swimming, or riding,
whichever sort of locomotion should be most popular in that province. Our imaginations were
kindled by reading that the "most superb line of stages on the continent" ran from New Glasgow
to the Gut of Canso. If the reader perfectly understands this programme, he has the advantage
of the two travelers at the time they made it.

It was a gray morning when we embarked from St. John, and in fact a little drizzle of rain
veiled the Martello tower, and checked, like the cross-strokes of a line engraving, the hill
on which it stands. The miscellaneous shining of such a harbor appears best in a golden haze,
or in the mist of a morning like this. We had expected days of fog in this region; but the
fog seemed to have gone out with the high tides of the geography. And it is simple justice
to these possessions of her Majesty, to say that in our two weeks' acquaintance of them they
enjoyed as delicious weather as ever falls on sea and shore, with the exception of this day
when we crossed the Bay of Fundy. And this day was only one of those cool interludes of low
color, which an artist would be thankful to introduce among a group of brilliant pictures.
Such a day rests the traveler, who is overstimulated by shifting scenes played upon by the
dazzling sun. So the cool gray clouds spread a grateful umbrella above us as we ran across
the Bay of Fundy, sighted the headlands of the Gut of Digby, and entered into the Annapolis
Basin, and into the region of a romantic history. The white houses of Digby, scattered over
the downs like a flock of washed sheep, had a somewhat chilly aspect, it is true, and made
us long for the sun on them. But as I think of it now, I prefer to have the town and the pretty
hillsides that stand about the basin in the light we saw them; and especially do I like to
recall the high wooden pier at Digby, deserted by the tide and so blown by the wind that the
passengers who came out on it, with their tossing drapery, brought to mind the windy Dutch
harbors that Backhuysen painted. We landed a priest here, and it was a pleasure to see him
as he walked along the high pier, his broad hat flapping, and the wind blowing his long skirts
away from his ecclesiastical legs.

It was one of the coincidences of life, for which no one can account, that when we descended
upon these coasts, the Governor-General of the Dominion was abroad in his Provinces. There
was an air of expectation of him everywhere, and of preparation for his coming; his lordship
was the subject of conversation on the Digby boat, his movements were chronicled in the newspapers,
and the gracious bearing of the Governor and Lady Dufferin at the civic receptions, balls,
and picnics was recorded with loyal satisfaction; even a literary flavor was given to the provincial
journals by quotations from his lordship's condescension to letters in the "High Latitudes."
It was not without pain, however, that even in this un-American region we discovered the old
Adam of journalism in the disposition of the newspapers of St. John toward sarcasm touching
the well-meant attempts to entertain the Governor and his lady in the provincial town of Halifax,--a
disposition to turn, in short, upon the demonstrations of loyal worship the faint light of
ridicule. There were those upon the boat who were journeying to Halifax to take part in the
civic ball about to be given to their excellencies, and as we were going in the same direction,
we shared in the feeling of satisfaction which proximity to the Great often excites.

We had other if not deeper causes of satisfaction. We were sailing along the gracefully moulded
and tree-covered hills of the Annapolis Basin, and up the mildly picturesque river of that
name, and we were about to enter what the provincials all enthusiastically call the Garden
of Nova Scotia. This favored vale, skirted by low ranges of hills on either hand, and watered
most of the way by the Annapolis River, extends from the mouth of the latter to the town of
Windsor on the river Avon. We expected to see something like the fertile valleys of the Connecticut
or the Mohawk. We should also pass through those meadows on the Basin of Minas which Mr. Longfellow
has made more sadly poetical than any other spot on the Western Continent. It is,--this valley
of the Annapolis,--in the belief of provincials, the most beautiful and blooming place in the
world, with a soil and climate kind to the husbandman; a land of fair meadows, orchards, and
vines. It was doubtless our own fault that this land did not look to us like a garden, as it
does to the inhabitants of Nova Scotia; and it was not until we had traveled over the rest
of the country, that we saw the appropriateness of the designation. The explanation is, that
not so much is required of a garden here as in some other parts of the world. Excellent apples,
none finer, are exported from this valley to England, and the quality of the potatoes is said
to ap-proach an ideal perfection here. I should think that oats would ripen well also in a
good year, and grass, for those who care for it, may be satisfactory. I should judge that the
other products of this garden are fish and building-stone. But we anticipate. And have we forgotten
the "murmuring pines and the hemlocks"? Nobody, I suppose, ever travels here without believing
that he sees these trees of the imagination, so forcibly has the poet projected them upon the
uni-versal consciousness. But we were unable to see them, on this route.

It would be a brutal thing for us to take seats in the railway train at Annapolis, and leave
the ancient town, with its modern houses and remains of old fortifications, without a thought
of the romantic history which saturates the region. There is not much in the smart, new restaurant,
where a tidy waiting-maid skillfully depreciates our currency in exchange for bread and cheese
and ale, to recall the early drama of the French discovery and settlement. For it is to the
French that we owe the poetical interest that still invests, like a garment, all these islands
and bays, just as it is to the Spaniards that we owe the romance of the Florida coast. Every
spot on this continent that either of these races has touched has a color that is wanting in
the prosaic settlements of the English.

Without the historical light of French adventure upon this town and basin of Annapolis, or
Port Royal, as they were first named, I confess that I should have no longing to stay here
for a week; notwithstanding the guide-book distinctly says that this harbor has "a striking
resemblance to the beautiful Bay of Naples." I am not offended at this remark, for it is the
one always made about a harbor, and I am sure the passing traveler can stand it, if the Bay
of Naples can. And yet this tranquil basin must have seemed a haven of peace to the first discoverers.

It was on a lovely summer day in 1604, that the Sieur de Monts and his comrades, Champlain
and the Baron de Poutrincourt, beating about the shores of Nova Scotia, were invited by the
rocky gateway of the Port Royal Basin. Since Poutrincourt's day, the hills have been somewhat
denuded of trees, and the waterfalls are not now in sight; at least, not under such a gray
sky as we saw.

The reader who once begins to look into the French occupancy of Acadia is in danger of getting
into a sentimental vein, and sentiment is the one thing to be shunned in these days. Yet I
cannot but stay, though the train should leave us, to pay my respectful homage to one of the
most heroic of women, whose name recalls the most romantic incident in the history of this
region. Out of this past there rises no figure so captivating to the imagination as that of
Madame de la Tour. And it is noticeable that woman has a curious habit of coming to the front
in critical moments of history, and performing some exploit that eclipses in brilliancy all
the deeds of contemporary men; and the exploit usually ends in a pathetic tragedy, that fixes
it forever in the sympathy of the world. I need not copy out of the pages of De Charlevoix
the well-known story of Madame de la Tour; I only wish he had told us more about her. It is
here at Port Royal that we first see her with her husband. Charles de St. Etienne, the Chevalier
de la Tour,--there is a world of romance in these mere names,--was a Huguenot nobleman who
had a grant of Port Royal and of La Hive, from Louis XIII. He ceded La Hive to Razilli, the
governor-in-chief of the provinces, who took a fancy to it, for a residence. He was living
peacefully at Port Royal in 1647, when the Chevalier d'Aunay Charnise, having succeeded his
brother Razilli at La Hive, tired of that place and removed to Port Royal. De Charnise was
a Catholic; the difference in religion might not have produced any unpleasantness, but the
two noblemen could not agree in dividing the profits of the peltry trade,--each being covetous,
if we may so express it, of the hide of the savage continent, and determined to take it off
for himself. At any rate, disagreement arose, and De la Tour moved over to the St. John, of
which region his father had enjoyed a grant from Charles I. of England,--whose sad fate it
is not necessary now to recall to the reader's mind,--and built a fort at the mouth of the
river. But the differences of the two ambitious Frenchmen could not be composed. De la Tour
obtained aid from Governor Winthrop at Boston, thus verifying the Catholic prediction that
the Huguenots would side with the enemies of France on occasion. De Charnise received orders
from Louis to arrest De la Tour; but a little preliminary to the arrest was the possession
of the fort of St. John, and this he could not obtain, although be sent all his force against
it. Taking advantage, however, of the absence of De la Tour, who had a habit of roving about,
he one day besieged St. John. Madame de la Tour headed the little handful of men in the fort,
and made such a gallant resistance that De Charnise was obliged to draw off his fleet with
the loss of thirty-three men,--a very serious loss, when the supply of men was as distant as
France. But De Charnise would not be balked by a woman; he attacked again; and this time, one
of the garrison, a Swiss, betrayed the fort, and let the invaders into the walls by an unguarded
entrance. It was Easter morning when this misfortune occurred, but the peaceful influence of
the day did not avail. When Madame saw that she was betrayed, her spirits did not quail; she
took refuge with her little band in a detached part of the fort, and there made such a bold
show of defense, that De Charnise was obliged to agree to the terms of her surrender, which
she dictated. No sooner had this unchivalrous fellow obtained possession of the fort and of
this Historic Woman, than, overcome with a false shame that he had made terms with a woman,
he violated his noble word, and condemned to death all the men, except one, who was spared
on condition that he should be the executioner of the others. And the poltroon compelled the
brave woman to witness the execution, with the added indignity of a rope round her neck,--or
as De Charlevoix much more neatly expresses it, "obligea sa prisonniere d'assister a l'execution,
la corde au cou."

To the shock of this horror the womanly spirit of Madame de la Tour succumbed; she fell into
a decline and died soon after. De la Tour, himself an exile from his province, wandered about
the New World in his customary pursuit of peltry. He was seen at Quebec for two years. While
there, he heard of the death of De Charnise, and straightway repaired to St. John. The revolver,

Before we reached Wolfville we came in sight of this basin and some of the estuaries and streams
that run into it; that is, when the tide goes out; but they are only muddy ditches half the
time. The Acadia College was pointed out to us at Wolfville by a person who said that it is
a feeble institution, a remark we were sorry to hear of a place described as "one of the foremost
seats of learning in the Province." But our regret was at once extinguished by the announcement
that the next station was Grand Pre! We were within three miles of the most poetic place in
North America.

There was on the train a young man from Boston, who said that he was born in Grand Pre. It
seemed impossible that we should actually be near a person so felicitously born. He had a justifiable
pride in the fact, as well as in the bride by his side, whom he was taking to see for the first
time his old home. His local information, imparted to her, overflowed upon us; and when he
found that we had read "Evangeline," his delight in making us acquainted with the scene of
that poem was pleasant to see. The village of Grand Pre is a mile from the station; and perhaps
the reader would like to know exactly what the traveler, hastening on to Baddeck, can see of
the famous locality.

We looked over a well-grassed meadow, seamed here and there by beds of streams left bare by
the receding tide, to a gentle swell in the ground upon which is a not heavy forest growth.
The trees partly conceal the street of Grand Pre, which is only a road bordered by common houses.
Beyond is the Basin of Minas, with its sedgy shore, its dreary flats; and beyond that projects
a bold headland, standing perpendicular against the sky. This is the Cape Blomidon, and it
gives a certain dignity to the picture.

The old Normandy picturesqueness has departed from the village of Grand Pre. Yankee settlers,
we were told, possess it now, and there are no descendants of the French Acadians in this valley.

At any rate, there is nothing here now except a faint tradition of the French Acadians; and
the sentimental traveler who laments that they were driven out, and not left behind their dikes
to rear their flocks, and cultivate the rural virtues, and live in the simplicity of ignorance,
will temper his sadness by the reflection that it is to the expulsion he owes "Evangeline"
and the luxury of his romantic grief. So that if the traveler is honest, and examines his own
soul faithfully, he will not know what state of mind to cherish as he passes through this region
of sorrow.

Our eyes lingered as long as possible and with all eagerness upon these meadows and marshes
which the poet has made immortal, and we regretted that inexorable Baddeck would not permit
us to be pilgrims for a day in this Acadian land. Just as I was losing sight of the skirt of
trees at Grand Pre, a gentleman in the dress of a rural clergyman left his seat, and complimented
me with this remark: "I perceive, sir, that you are fond of reading."

I could not but feel flattered by this unexpected discovery of my nature, which was no doubt
due to the fact that I held in my hand one of the works of Charles Reade on social science,
called "Love me Little, Love me Long," and I said, "Of some kinds, I am."

"Did you ever see a work called 'Evangeline'?"

"Oh, yes, I have frequently seen it."

"You may remember," continued this Mass of Information, "that there is an allusion in it to
Grand Pre. That is the place, sir!"

"Oh, indeed, is that the place? Thank you."

"And that mountain yonder is Cape Blomidon, blow me down, you know."

And under cover of this pun, the amiable clergyman retired, unconscious, I presume, of his
prosaic effect upon the atmosphere of the region. With this intrusion of the commonplace, I
suffered an eclipse of faith as to Evangeline, and was not sorry to have my attention taken
up by the river Avon, along the banks of which we were running about this time. It is really
a broad arm of the basin, extending up to Windsor, and beyond in a small stream, and would
have been a charming river if there had been a drop of water in it. I never knew before how
much water adds to a river. Its slimy bottom was quite a ghastly spectacle, an ugly gash in
the land that nothing could heal but the friendly returning tide. I should think it would be
confusing to dwell by a river that runs first one way and then the other, and then vanishes
altogether.

All the streams about this basin are famous for their salmon and shad, and the season for these
fish was not yet passed. There seems to be an untraced affinity between the shad and the strawberry;
they appear and disappear in a region simultaneously. When we reached Cape Breton, we were
a day or two late for both. It is impossible not to feel a little contempt for people who do
not have these luxuries till July and August; but I suppose we are in turn despised by the
Southerners because we do not have them till May and June.

Windsor, a most respectable old town round which the railroad sweeps, with its iron bridge,
conspicuous King's College, and handsome church spire, is a great place for plaster and limestone,
and would be a good location for a person interested in these substances. Indeed, if a man
can live on rocks, like a goat, he may settle anywhere between Windsor and Halifax. It is one
of the most sterile regions in the Province. With the exception of a wild pond or two, we saw
nothing but rocks and stunted firs, for forty-five miles, a monotony unrelieved by one picturesque
feature. Then we longed for the "Garden of Nova Scotia," and understood what is meant by the name.

A member of the Ottawa government, who was on his way to the Governor-General's ball at Halifax,
informed us that this country is rich in minerals, in iron especially, and he pointed out spots
where gold had been washed out. But we do not covet it. And we were not sorry to learn from
this gentleman, that since the formation of the Dominion, there is less and less desire in
the Provinces for annexation to the United States. One of the chief pleasures in traveling
in Nova Scotia now is in the constant reflection that you are in a foreign country; and annexation
would take that away.

It is nearly dark when we reach the head of the Bedford Basin. The noble harbor of Halifax
narrows to a deep inlet for three miles along the rocky slope on which the city stands, and
then suddenly expands into this beautiful sheet of water. We ran along its bank for five miles,
cheered occasionally by a twinkling light on the shore, and then came to a stop at the shabby
terminus, three miles out of town. This basin is almost large enough to float the navy of Great
Britain, and it could lie here, with the narrows fortified, secure from the attacks of the
American navy, hovering outside in the fog. With these patriotic thoughts we enter the town.
It is not the fault of the railroad, but its present inability to climb a rocky hill, that
it does not run into the city. The suburbs are not impressive in the night, but they look better
then than they do in the daytime; and the same might be said of the city itself. Probably there
is not anywhere a more rusty, forlorn town, and this in spite of its magnificent situation.
