THE PRUSSIAN OFFICER

I

They had marched more than thirty kilometres since dawn, along the white, hot road where occasional
thickets of trees threw a moment of shade, then out into the glare again. On either hand, the
valley, wide and shallow, glittered with heat; dark green patches of rye, pale young corn,
fallow and meadow and black pine woods spread in a dull, hot diagram under a glistening sky.
But right in front the mountains ranged across, pale blue and very still, snow gleaming gently
out of the deep atmosphere. And towards the mountains, on and on, the regiment marched between
the rye fields and the meadows, between the scraggy fruit trees set regularly on either side
the high road. The burnished, dark green rye threw on a suffocating heat, the mountains drew
gradually nearer and more distinct. While the feet of the soldiers grew hotter, sweat ran through
their hair under their helmets, and their knapsacks could burn no more in contact with their
shoulders, but seemed instead to give off a cold, prickly sensation.

He walked on and on in silence, staring at the mountains ahead, that rose sheer out of the
land, and stood fold behind fold, half earth, half heaven, the heaven, the banner with slits
of soft snow, in the pale, bluish peaks.

He could now walk almost without pain. At the start, he had determined not to limp. It had
made him sick to take the first steps, and during the first mile or so, he had compressed his
breath, and the cold drops of sweat had stood on his forehead. But he had walked it off. What
were they after all but bruises! He had looked at them, as he was getting up: deep bruises
on the backs of his thighs. And since he had made his first step in the morning, he had been
conscious of them, till now he had a tight, hot place in his chest, with suppressing the pain,
and holding himself in. There seemed no air when he breathed. But he walked almost lightly.

The Captain's hand had trembled at taking his coffee at dawn: his orderly saw it again. And
he saw the fine figure of the Captain wheeling on horseback at the farm-house ahead, a handsome
figure in pale blue uniform with facings of scarlet, and the metal gleaming on the black helmet
and the sword-scabbard, and dark streaks of sweat coming on the silky bay horse. The orderly
felt he was connected with that figure moving so suddenly on horseback: he followed it like
a shadow, mute and inevitable and damned by it. And the officer was always aware of the tramp
of the company behind, the march of his orderly among the men.

The Captain was a tall man of about forty, grey at the temples. He had a handsome, finely knit
figure, and was one of the best horsemen in the West. His orderly, having to rub him down,
admired the amazing riding-muscles of his loins.

For the rest, the orderly scarcely noticed the officer any more than he noticed, himself. It
was rarely he saw his master's face: he did not look at it. The Captain had reddish-brown,
stilt hair, that he wore short upon his skull. His moustache was also cut short and bristly
over a full, brutal mouth. His face was rather rugged, the cheeks thin. Perhaps the man was
the more handsome for the deep lines in his face, the irritable tension of his brow, which
gave him the look of a man who fights with life. His fair eyebrows stood bushy over light blue
eyes that were always flashing with cold fire.

He was a Prussian aristocrat, haughty and overbearing. But his mother had been a Polish Countess.
Having made too many gambling debts when he was young, he had ruined his prospects in the Army,
and remained an infantry captain. He had never married: his position did not allow of it, and
no woman had ever moved him to it. His time he spent riding--occasionally he rode one of his
own horses at the races--and at the officers club. Now and then he took himself a mistress.
But after such an event, he returned to duty with his brow still more tense, his eyes still
more hostile and irritable. With the men, however, he was merely impersonal, though a devil
when roused; so that, on the whole, they feared him, but had no great aversion from him. They
accepted him as the inevitable.

To his orderly he was at first cold and just and indifferent: he did not fuss over trifles.
So that his servant knew practically nothing about him, except just what orders he would give,
and how he wanted them obeyed. That was quite simple. Then the change gradually came.

The orderly was a youth of about twenty-two, of medium height, and well built. He had strong,
heavy limbs, was swarthy, with a soft, black, young moustache. There was something altogether
warm and young about him. This standing as if under a compulsion,
He had again and again: Your king comes to you.

Children's voices sang those words. She lay still unformed between palate and tongue. From the inarticulate
sound of his breath he could hear her. In between, Hosanna, rushing
Palm leaves, shouting, bleach, ecstatic faces.

Then sudden silence - loneliness.

He looked up, amazed. How do all the scenes. Stone houses right and
left, silent, sober, sleepy.

He thoughtfully considered. Gradually, as it was certain to be started Interior arrange to take
part. He was small, simple, and began to look sober.

Here and there a window was open. The head of a girl's house was visible, we knocked a Betteppich
from. A student, black-haired, with thick lips, evidently a Russians, turned on the window sill his
breakfast cigarette. And then there was lively on the road. The eyes fixed on the ground, he
did it but not, to furtively .

Watch He often looked into the midst of a broad, cheeky smile. He often remarked how amazed the
mockery banished. But behind his back then freed himself the ridicule, and bold speeches, sharp
and biting, flew after him.

With each step, among so many bites and blows it was commonplace to make sense. A cramp sat
him in the throat. The old bitter, hopeless grief emerged. Like a wall, thick, insurmountable,
they stood up before him, the cruel blindness of the people.

Now it seemed to him at once, as if everything is a waste of denial. He was probably only a vain,
small, shallow nature. He was surely right when he was mocked and ridiculed. He felt for several
minutes the pain and shame of a unmasked impostor and a desire to
by all the world to run away to hide themselves, to hide, or by any
means his life to make even an end.

Had he been alone now, he would be the rope around his head like a
halo seemed to have torn down and burned.

As mentioned in a fool's crown of paper, semi- annihilated with shame, he went under.

In narrow, labyrinthine alleys without the sun he had been distracted.

A little window full of Pastry put it on. He opened the glass door and entered the store. The baker
looked at him - the baker's wife - he chose a small loaf of bread, said nothing and left.

At the door, a crowd had gathered curious: an old woman, children,
a Schlächtergesell, the tray with red meat pieces on the shoulder.

He scanned their faces, it was nothing Naughty in it, and went right through it out of his
way.

By what expression they had all looked at him! Only The bakers people. As if the small Not needed
bread to eat, but rather in order to do a miracle. And why wait the people on it before the doors?
There must be a reason. And now even the patter and whispering behind him. Why was it for him? Why
are you pursuing it?

He was listening intently and soon perceived that he had an entourage of children behind. By cross-walking
and cross over small areas with old well out deliberately inverting and changing the direction,
he made sure that the small group not let him go.

Why they pursued him, being not satisfied with the sight of him?
They expected more of him? Did they hope, in fact, he something new,
extraordinary, wonderful to see? He felt as if were speaking from
the humdrum Did the noise of their feet, a strong belief even more
than this: a certainty. And suddenly it came to him out loud, why
prophets, true Human full size and purity, so often at the end of
the common scams. He felt suddenly a burning addiction, an irresistible
impulse to do something wonderful, and the biggest shame would be
to him appeared small in comparison to the admission of his Unkraft.

Until
the Limmatquai he had now arrived, and still he followed the little
ones. Some trot, the greater power inordinately long steps to meet
him. The officer had long
suffered from it, and wanted to do something to it. Still it was there, ugly and brutal on
the young, brown hand. At last the Captain's reserve gave way. One day, as the orderly was
smoothing out the tablecloth, the officer pinned down his thumb with a pencil, asking,

"How did you come by that?"

The young man winced and drew back at attention.

"A wood-axe, Herr Hauptmann," he answered.

The officer waited for further explanation. None came. The orderly went about his duties. The
elder man was sullenly angry. His servant avoided him. And the next day he had to use all his
willpower to avoid seeing the scarred thumb. He wanted to get hold of it and---- A hot flame
ran in his blood.

He knew his servant would soon be free, and would be glad. As yet, the soldier had held himself
off from the elder man. The Captain grew madly irritable. He could not rest when the soldier
was away, and when he was present, he glared at him with tormented eyes. He hated those fine,
black brows over trie unmeaning, dark eyes, he was infuriated by the free movement of the handsome
limbs, which no military discipline could make stiff. And he became harsh and cruelly bullying,
using contempt and satire. The young soldier only grew more mute and expressionless.

What cattle were you bred by, that you can t keep straight eyes? Look me in the eyes when I
speak to you.

And the soldier turned his dark eyes to the other's face, but there was no sight in them: he
stared with the slightest possible cast, holding back his sight, perceiving the blue of his
master's eyes, but receiving no look from them. And the elder man went pale, and his reddish
eyebrows twitched. He gave his order, barrenly.

Once he flung a heavy military glove into the young soldier's face. Then he had the satisfaction
of seeing the black eyes flare up into his own, like a blaze when straw is thrown on a fire.
And he had laughed with a little tremor and a sneer.

But there were only two months more. The youth instinctively tried to keep himself intact:
he tried to serve the officer as if the latter were an abstract authority and not a man. All
his instinct was to avoid personal contact, even definite hate. But in spite of himself the
hate grew, responsive to the officer's passion. However, he put it in the background. When
he had left the Army he could dare acknowledge it. By nature he was active, and had many friends.
He thought what amazing good fellows they were. But, without knowing it, he was alone. Now
this solitariness was intensified. It would carry him through his term. But the officer seemed
to be going irritably insane, and the youth was deeply frightened.

The soldier had a sweetheart, a girl from the mountains, independent and primitive. The two
walked together, rather silently. He went with her, not to talk, but to have his arm round
her, and for the physical contact. This eased him, made it easier for him to ignore the Captain;
for he could rest with her held fast against his chest. And she, in some unspoken fashion,
was there for him. They loved each other.

The Captain perceived it, and was mad with irritation. He kept the young man engaged all the
evenings long, and took pleasure in the dark look that came on his face. Occasionally, the
eyes of the two men met, those of the younger sullen and dark, doggedly unalterable, those
of the elder sneering with restless contempt.

The officer tried hard not to admit the passion that had got hold of him. He would not know
that his feeling for his orderly was anything but that of a man incensed by his stupid, perverse
servant. So, keeping quite justified and conventional in his consciousness, he let the other
thing run on. His nerves, however, were suffering. At last he slung the end of a belt in his
servant's face. When he saw the youth start back, the pain-tears in his eyes and the blood
on his mouth, he had felt at once a thrill of deep pleasure and of shame.

But this, he acknowledged to himself, was a thing he had never done before. The fellow was
too exasperating. His own nerves must be going to pieces. He went away for some days with a woman.

It was a mockery of pleasure. He simply did not want the woman. But he stayed on for his time.
At the end of it, he came back in an agony of irritation, torment, and misery. He rode all
the evening, then came straight in to supper. His orderly was out. The officer sat with his
long, fine hands lying on the table, perfectly still, and all his blood seemed to be corroding.

At last his servant entered. He watched the strong, easy young figure, the fine eyebrows, the
thick black hair. In a week's time the youth had got back his old well-being. When today disappear all the Jews were numerous Christians of all nations to continue the
Jewish spirit. If the source of this attitude to the Jews not quite, but often is a burden, we must
not forget that the effects of pressure, torture, mistreatment during hundreds of years can not
be offset by Emancipation of half a century and a more than a thousand years Hatred does not cease
to exist in fifty years. That they have remained without a country a CompactFlash nation, passed
them to glory, but to reproach us with Christians. In the heat for their anti-Semites deny the idea
almost the story, ignore torture, JudengÃ¤Ãchen, Jews, taxes, torture of any kind, excluding
almost every office and purchase. KrÃ¤mer not call them, merchants, in the face of a Rothschild!
Ring the alarm bell against hundreds of thousands of Jews and their victories over millions of
Christians, but among all people cheaters who cheat can be, and the armies are not to be found
also, that we exterminate the Jews. Is it for spiritual, diabolical weapons, let us be Christians
only, instead of millions to overflow into the camp of fraud, fraud and GrÃ¼nderei which are
nowhere so shamelessly as in France, where there are very few Jews. Let us in our Christian efforts so
tough, so smart, so be persistent as Jews, let us, as they purchase first and then spend rather
than us spending so long at the stop until the cutthroats we even run into the arms because

also well against each other. How much strength, wisdom, experience in the minds and words
of the people's representatives!


The young soldier was gone, looking old, and walking heavily.

The officer, left alone, held himself rigid, to prevent himself from thinking. His instinct
warned him that he must not think. Deep inside him was the intense gratification of his passion,
still working powerfully. Then there was a counter-action, a horrible breaking down of something
inside him, a whole agony of reaction. He stood there for an hour motionless, a chaos of sensations,
but rigid with a will to keep blank his consciousness, to prevent his mind grasping. And he
held himself so until the worst of the stress had passed, when he began to drink, drank himself
to an intoxication, till he slept obliterated. When he woke in the morning he was shaken to
the base of his nature. But he had fought off the realization of what he had done. He had prevented
his mind from taking it in, had suppressed, it along with his instincts, and the conscious
man had nothing to do with it. He felt only as after a bout of intoxication, weak, but the
affair itself all dim and not to be recovered. Of the drunkenness of his passion he successfully
refused remembrance. And when his orderly appeared with coffee, the officer assumed the same
self he had had the morning before. He refused the event of the past night--denied it had ever
been--and was successful in his denial. He had not done any such thing--not he himself. Whatever
there might be lay at the door of a stupid, insubordinate servant.

The orderly had gone about in a stupor all the evening. He drank some beer because he was parched,
but not much, the alcohol made his feeling come back, and he could not bear it. He was dulled,
as if nine-tenths of the ordinary man in him were inert. He crawled about disfigured. Still,
when he thought of the kicks, he went sick, and when he thought of the threat of more kicking,
in the room afterwards, his heart went hot and faint, and he panted, remembering the one that
had come. He had been forced to say, "For my girl." He was much too done even to want to cry.
His mouth hung slightly open, like an idiot's. He felt vacant, and wasted. So, he wandered
at his work, painfully, and very slowly and clumsily, fumbling blindly with the brushes, and
finding it difficult, when he sat down, to summon the energy to move again. His limbs, his
jaw, were slack and nerveless. But he was very tired. He got to bed at last, and slept inert,
relaxed, in a sleep that was rather stupor than slumber, a dead night of stupefaction shot
through with gleams of anguish.

In the morning were the manoeuvres. But he woke even before the bugle sounded. The painful
ache in his chest, the dryness of his throat, the awful steady feeling of misery made his eyes
come awake and dreary at once. He knew, without thinking, what had happened. And he knew that
the day had come again, when he must go on with his round. The last bit of darkness was being
pushed out of the room. He would have to move his inert body and go on. He was so young, and
had known so little trouble, that he was bewildered. He only wished it would stay night, so
that he could lie still, covered up by the darkness. And yet nothing would prevent the day
from coming, nothing would save him from having to get up and saddle the Captain's horse, and
make the Captain's coffee. It was there, inevitable. And then, he thought, it was impossible.
Yet they would not leave him free. He must go and take the coffee to the Captain. He was too
stunned to understand it. He only knew it was inevitable--inevitable however long he lay inert.

At last, after heaving at himself, for he seemed to be a mass of inertia, he got up. But he
had to force every one of his movements from behind, with his will. He felt lost, and dazed,
and helpless. Then he clutched hold of the bed, the pain was so keen. And looking at his thighs,
he saw the darker bruises on his swarthy flesh and he knew that, if he pressed one of his fingers
on one of the bruises, he should faint. But he did not want to faint---he did not want anybody
to know. No one should ever know. It was between him and the Captain. There were only the two
people in the world now--himself and the Captain.

Slowly, economically, he got dressed and forced himself to walk. Everything was obscure, except
just what he had his hands on. But he managed to get through his work. The very pain revived
his dull senses. The worst remained yet. He took the tray and went up to the Captain's room.
The officer, pale and heavy, sat at the table. The orderly, as he saluted, felt himself put
out of existence. He stood still for a moment submitting to his own nullification, then he
gathered himself, seemed to regain himself, and then the Captain began to grow vague, unreal,
and the younger soldier's heart beat up. He clung to this situation--that the Captain did not
exist--so that he himself might live. But when he saw his officer's hand tremble as he took
the coffee, he felt everything falling shattered. And he went away, feeling as if he himself
were coming to pieces, disintegrated. And when the Captain was there on horseback, giving orders,
while he himself stood, with rifle and knapsack, sick with pain, he felt as if he must shut
his eyes--as if he must shut his eyes on everything. It was only the long agony of marching
with a parched throat that filled him with one single, sleep-heavy intention: to save himself.

II

He was getting used even to his parched throat. That the snowy peaks were radiant among the
sky, that the whity-green glacier-river twisted through its pale shoals, in the valley below,
seemed almost supernatural. But he was going mad with fever and thirst. He plodded on uncomplaining.
He did not want to speak, not to anybody. There were two gulls, like flakes of water and snow,
over the river. The scent of green rye soaked in sunshine came like a sickness. And the march
continued, monotonously, almost like a bad sleep.

At the next farm-house, which stood low and broad near the high road, tubs of water had been
put out. The soldiers clustered round to drink. They took off their helmets, and the steam
mounted from their wet hair. Captain sat on horseback, watching. He needed to see his orderly.
His hel-met threw a dark shadow over his light, fierce eyes, but his moustache and mouth and
chin were distinct in the sunshine. The orderly must move under the presence of the figure
of the horseman. It was not that he was afraid, or cowed. It was as if he was disembowllled,
made empty, like an empty shell. He felt himself as nothing, a shadow creeping under the sunshine. 

When it was winter again, Father Joseph brought on Sundays again the puppets out of her crate
down, and I'm no different than that in such a quiet exchange the employment it would go well in
future, the years. Then he went one morning with even serious face to me in the living room where
I was just alone with my breakfast sat. "Son," he said after he laid down as a couple of times
by hand through his white hair skewers had gone, "but I can nit's probably a fair length, I
all because so my bread on your table to eat. "

I did not know where this should also, but I asked him how he came to such thoughts; yes it creates
in the workshop, and if my business now yield a bigger profit, It said that much of the interest of
his own fortune, which he at our wedding morning have put in my hand.

He shook his head. The rich not everything, but just that little fortune he had to Part once played
in our city, the theater is still there, and I have the pieces it all still in my head.

Then I noticed's because well, the old puppet master left him no peace, and his friend, the good
Heinrich enough for him not as an audience, he had once again publicly before the assembled People drove
into its pieces.

I tried to dissuade him, but he always came back on again. I spoke with Lisei, and in the end we
could not help him to yield. Most of all certainly had the old Man seen when Lisei still our marriage,
the role of women speaking in his plays would have, but we had agreed not to understand its meaning
aiming references; for the wife of a citizen and master craftsman
would be befitting for the not yet.

Luckily - or, as you will, to the accident - was now a very reputable woman in the city that had
once served in a theater troupe as a prompter and therefore not in such matters was inexperienced.
This - Kroepel-Lies they called the people because of their cross lameness - went immediately
to our offer, and soon developed in the evening and little room on Sunday afternoons, the liveliest
activity in Joseph's father. While carpentered before a window of the old Henry the Gerueststuecken
the theater was, before the other between freshly painted scenes that hung from the ceiling,
the old puppeteer and drill with Kroepel-Lies a scene after another. You is a spiced three women,
he always assured by such sample, not even the Lisei got it got it so quickly, would only nit
with the singing it does so beautiful, they grunt with her voice always in the depth, which for
this lovely Susan, to sing the song did, was not just harmony.

Finally the day of the performance was fixed. Every effort should reputable as possible before to go, not
to the shooting, but in the council chamber, where the first form Michaelis talked to her Redeuebungen,
should now be the scene, and when on Saturday afternoons our good
citizens of their fresh Wochenblaettchen unfolded jumped them in broad
Letters the advertisement in the eyes:

"Tomorrow, Sunday night on
the town hall clock sieben Puppet Theater of the Joseph Mechanicus
Tendler hieselbst.

The beautiful Susanna, play with songs in four lifts. "

It was at that time in our city is no longer the innocent bystanders from my youth Childhood
and the times of the Cossack winter were in between, and in particular was among the Craft
apprentices a gross licentiousness torn, and the former lover in the Dignitaries but had their
minds on other things now. Nevertheless, perhaps everything would be gone well, had not only
the black Schmidt and his boys have been. "I asked Paulsen, who it was because I had never heard
of such a person in our city.

"I think so," replied he, "Schmidt is in the black years ago poorhouse died, but at that time he
was a master, like me, not awkward, but his Lueders Work as in life, the economical merit of
the day was in the evening drinking and playing cards wasted. Even against my father, he had had
a hatred, not only because its customers which far exceeded his own, but even in her youth, where
he its by apprentice have been driven away, and because of a bad
prank on him by the master was. He knew it very well.
After a word with the lieutenant, he went a few paces higher, and sat there, a dominant figure,
his sweat-marked horse swishing its tail, while he looked down on his men, on his orderly,
a nonentity among the crowd.

The young soldier's heart was like fire in his chest, and he breathed with difficulty. The
officer, looking downhill, saw three of the young soldiers, two pails of water between them,
staggering across a sunny green field. A table had been set up under a tree, and there the
slim lieutenant stood, importantly busy. Then the Captain summoned himself to an act of courage.
He called his orderly.

The name leapt into the young soldier's throat as he heard, the command, and he rose blindly,
stifled. He saluted, standing below the officer. He did not look up. But there was the flicker
in the Captain's voice.

"Go to the inn and fetch me..." the officer gave his commands. "Quick !" he added.

At the last word, the heart of the servant leapt with a flash, and he felt the strength come
over his body. But he turned in mechanical obedience, and set on at a heavy run downhill, looking
almost like a bear, his trousers bagging over his military boots. And the officer watched this
blind, plunging run all the way.

But it was only the outside of the orderly's body that was obeying so humbly and mechanically.
Inside had gradually accumulated a core into which all the energy of that young life was compact
and concentrated. He executed his commisssion, and plodded quickly back uphill. There was a
pain in his head, as he walked, that made him twist his features unknowingly. But hard there
in the centre of his chest was himself, himself, firm, and not to be plucked to pieces.

The captain had gone up into the wood. The orderly plodded through the hot, powerfully smelling
zone of the company's atmosphere. He had a curious mass of energy inside him now. The Captain
was less real than himself..He approached the green entrance to the wood. There, in the half-shade,
he saw the horse standing, the sunshine and the tuckering shadow of leaves dancing over his
brown body. There was a clearing where timber had lately been felled. Here, in the gold-green
shade beside the brilliant cup of sunshine, stood two figures, blue and pink, the bits of pink
showing out plainly. The Captain was talking to his lieutenant.

The orderly stood on the edge of the bright clearing, where great trunks of trees, stripped
and glistening, lay stretched like naked, brown-skinned bodies. Chips of wood littered the
trampled floor, like splashed light, and the bases of the felled trees stood here and there,
with their raw, level tops. Beyond was the brilliant, sunlit green of a beech.

"Then I will ride forward," the orderly heard his Captain say. The lieutenant saluted and strode
away. He himself went forward. A hot flash passed through his belly, as he tramped towards
his officer.

The Captain watched the rather heavy figure of the young soldier stumble forward, and his veins,
too, ran hot. This was to be man to man between them. He yielded before the solid, stumbling
figure with bent head. The orderly stooped and put the food on a level-sawn tree-base. The
Captain watched the glistening, sun-inflamed, naked hands. He wanted to speak to the young
soldier, but could not. The servant propped a bottle against his thigh, pressed open the cork,
and poured out the beer into the mug. He kept his head bent. The Captain accepted the mug.

"Hot!" he said, as if amiably.

The flame sprang out of the orderly's heart, nearly suffocating mm.

"Yes, sir," he replied, between shut teeth.

And he heard the sound of the Captain's drinking, and he clenched his fists, such a strong
torment came into his wrists. The life of a painter would not be sufficient to map all the beautiful orchids
that adorn the deep mountain valleys be afraid of the Peruvian Andes.

off the fine cloth of the uniform. So, it lay quite still in the shadow under there. A little
strip of sunshine ran along the breast, from a chink between the logs. The orderly sat by it
for a few moments. Here his own life also ended.

Then, through his daze, he heard the lieutenant, in a loud voice, explaining to the men outside
the wood, that they were to suppose the bridge on the river below was held by the enemy. Now
they were to march to the attack in such and such a manner. The lieutenant had no gift of expression.
The orderly, listening from habit, got muddled. And when the lieutenant began it all again
he ceased to hear. He knew he must go. He stood up. It surprised him that the leaves were glittering
in the sun, and the chips of wood reflecting white from the ground. For him a change had come
over the world. But for the rest it had not--all seemed the same. Only he had left it. And
he could not go back, It was his duty to return with the beer-pot and the bottle. He could
not. He had left all that. The lieutenant was still hoarsely explaining. He must go, or they
would, overtake him. And he could not bear contact with anyone now.

He drew his fingers over his eyes, trying to find out where he was. Then he turned away. He
saw the horse standing in the path. He went up to it and mounted. It hurt him to sit in the
saddle. The pain of keeping his seat occupied him as they cantered through the wood. He would
not have minded anything, but he could not get away from the sense of being divided from the
others. The path led out of the trees. On the edge of the wood he pulled up and stood watching.
There in the spacious sunshine of the valley soldiers were moving in a little swarm. Every
now and then, a man harrowing on a strip of fallow shouted to his oxen, at the turn. The village
and the white-towered church was small in the sunshine. And he no longer belonged to it--he
sat there, beyond, like a man outside in the dark. He had gone out from everyday life into
the unknown, and he could not, he even did not want to go back.

Turning from the sun-blazing valley, he rode deep into the wood. Tree-trunks, like people standing
grey and still, took no notice as he went. A doe, herself a moving bit of sunshine and shadow,
went running through the flecked shade. There were bright green rents in the foliage. Then
it was all pine wood, dark and cool. And he was sick with pain, he had an intolerable great
pulse in his head, and he was sick. He had never been ill in his life, he felt lost, quite
dazed with all this.

Trying to get down from the horse, he fell, astonished at the pain and his lack of balance.
The horse shifted uneasily. He jerked its bridle and sent it cantering jerkily away. It was
his last connection with the rest of things.

But he only wanted to lie down and not be disturbed. Stumbling through the trees, he came on
a quiet place where beeches and pine trees grew on a slope. Immediately he had lain down and
closed his eyes, his consciousness went racing on without him. A big pulse of sickness beat
in him as if it throbbed through the whole earth. He was burning with dry heat. But he was
too busy, too tearingly active in the incoherent race of delirium to observe.

He came to with a start. His mouth was dry and hard, his heart beat heavily, but he had not
the energy to get up. His heart beat heavily. Where was he?--the barracks--at home? There was
something knocking. And, making an effort, he looked round--trees, and litter of greenery,
and reddish, night, still pieces of sunshine on the floor. He did not believe he was himself,
he did not believe what he saw. Something was knocking. He made a struggle towards consciousness,
but relapsed. Then he struggled again. And gradually his surroundings fell into relationship
with himself. He knew, and a great pang of fear went through his heart. Somebody was knocking.
He could see the heavy, black rags of a fir tree overhead. Then everything went black. Yet
he did not believe he had closed his eyes. He had not. Out of the blackness sight slowly emerged
again. And someone was knocking. Quickly, he saw the blood-disgfigured face of his Captain,
which he hated. And he held himself still with horror. Yet, deep inside him, he knew that it
was so, the Captain should be dead. But the physical delirium got hold of him. Someone was
knocking. He lay perfectly still, as if dead, with fear. And he went unconscious.

When he opened his eyes again, he started, seeing something creeping swiftly up a tree-trunk.
It was a little bird. And the bird was whistling overhead. Tap-tap-tap----it was the small,
quick bird rapping the tree-trunk with its beak, as if its head were a little round hammer.
He watched it curiously. It shifted sharply, in its creeping fashion. Then, like a mouse, it
slid down the bare trunk. Its swift creeping sent a flash of revulsion through him. He raised
his head. It felt a great weight. Then, the little bird ran out of the shadow across a still
patch of sunshine, its little head bobbing swiftly, its white legs twinkling brightly for a
moment. How neat it was in its build, so compact, with pieces of white on its wings. There
were several of them. They were so pretty--but they crept like swift, erratic mice, running
here and there among the beech-mast.

He lay down again exhausted, and his consciousness lapsed. He had a horror of the little creeping
birds. All his blood seemed to be darting and creeping in his head. And yet he could not move.

He came to with a further ache of exhaustion. There was the pain in his head, and the horrible
sickness, and his inability to move. He had never been ill in his life. He did not know where
he was or what he was. Probably he had got sunstroke. Only me they tortured, and in the feeling that will come a time where I make
up my INCAPABLE wrong, I carefully preserved the letters of Jerome and refused repeatedly to destroy
them. Since I now forms part of the biography of my grandmother, I think her against a duty to
fulfill. And still more, perhaps I am guilty of the publication of her father: not only that it
was his blood seen in the fact, but also that he has been worthwhile
to have this daughter.

His name in Germany has no good sound: the most disgusting gossip, its venom to the level of a Napoleon,
even when he was a fallen giant, not up enough, holding on for innocence to his brothers and
sisters. Half libertine - half moron - that Jerome lived in the tradition of the descendants of those
Germans who thronged to his court, receiving from his grateful too generous hand titles and honors,
wealth and property. His letters to my grandmother have caused me to pull himself in his memoirs and his correspondence,
his family, his contemporaries and historians objective advice to get to know his true appearance
thereby. She sees very little of the traditional right. This also from the public to determine
to clean the image of his personality, the filth with which you have thrown at it, leaving it in
his goodness and kindness, as raised in his shocking tragedy - my heart was the need. And since it's
always been one of the nicest features of my grandmother, to control the libel, where she met her, I
think more so to act in their favor when I'm in this book describing grant her father's room. Unfortunately
had to stay clear image of their mother.

How it is different on each of their portraits, including its nature
is not to be recorded.

The beloved Jerome was viewed as such a dark spot in the family history that you tried to blur it
as much as possible. Her last letter to her daughter is the only sign of her personal life, preserving
it to me. What else is sleeping well may be present, probably under the strict protection of prudery in
lumber rooms and family archives, the sleep of death. are also other letters that I could incorporate
the book are new, less in extent than it would under other circumstances. Very much like his fallen
into destruction, and the closed family shrines and royal house archives, where are likely to find,
for example, the letters to the Empress Augusta, the Duchess of Orleans, the Grand Duke Karl Alexander
and others open, not me more. Where did it happen - what I will not omit to mention grateful - as in the Goethe-Schiller
Archives and the Archive of the Bonaparte family, has found nothing. * * * * * For a time, as
our understanding, which in itself in all of their sobriety was tired, it is characteristic that
she traces the history, hidden treasures brought to light again,
death inspires new life and live forever, the missing for a long time
they were again can work on you.

       Many see nothing in it as a sign of decadence, of dying, because
it is reminiscent of old people living with increasing age more and
more memory.

It seems to me that it is rather a sign of new, nascent life, the course must be preceded as usual in the
fall, the killing of the old. For longing is expressed in it, and desire is always something young,
the performance has to follow.
 And like the
golden, lustrous gleaming of the snow he felt his own thirst bright in him. He stood and gazed,
leaning against a tree. And then everything slid away into space.

During the night the lightning fluttered perpetually, making the whole sky white. He must have
walked again. The world hung livid round him for moments, fields a level sheen of grey-green
light, trees in dark bulk, and the range of clouds black across a white sky. Then the darkness
fell like a shutter, and the night was whole. A faint mutter of a half-revealed world, that
could not quite leap out of the darkness!--Then there again stood a sweep of pallor for the
land, dark shapes looming, a range of clouds hanging overhead. The world was a ghostly shadow,
thrown for a moment upon the pure darkness, which returned ever whole and complete. 

' In the dance I always ask to be very moderate, then he cannot agree
to you differently than probably.

' From the remaining letters the following would be still returned:
' My young lady!

' Cheap you should have opened for me for a long time the object
of your so deep BetrÃ¼bniÃ where especially and with name naming,
however, generally typically - not possibly only because I take hearty
interest as a person, but because I must know as your loyal doctor,
nevertheless, whether also the object of the kind was that also a
healthy person would have so strongly must not become of it affiziert,
or procure so that such a grief of the thing was not measured and
you could not have been bent so deeply and persistently of it without
being ill physically.

 He wanted them--he wanted them alone--he wanted to leave
himself and be identified with them. They did not move, they were still and soft, with white,
gentle markings of snow. He stood still, mad with suffering, his hands crisping and clutching.
Then he was twisting in a paroxysm on the grass.

He lay still, in a kind of dream of anguish. His thirst seemed to have separated itself from
him, and to stand apart, a single demand. Then the pain he felt was another single self. Then
there was the clog of his body, another separate thing. He was divided among all kinds of separate
beings. There was some strange, agonized connection between them, but they were drawing further
apart. Then they would all split. The sun, drilling down on him, was drilling through the bond.
Then they would all fall, fall through the everasting lapse of space. Then again, his consciousness
reasserted itself. He roused on to his elbow and stared at the gleaming mountains. The influence of the physical world to the moral, this mysterious mesh-work In addition to the
sensuous and sensual, gives the study of nature, when it points to higher rises, a private, unknown
or too little stimulus.

When the soldiers found him, three hours later, he was lying with his face over his arm, his
black hair giving off heat under the sun. But he was still alive. Seeing the open, black mouth
the young soldiers dropped him in horror. The bright yellow lichens, in the distance
appear brown, and the bluish gray lichen transforms little by little into black. The edges of these
ancient blankets merge, and on the dark ground new circles of dazzling white lichen appear.
