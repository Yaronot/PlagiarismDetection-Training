THE LIFE STORY OF COL. WILLIAM F. CODY "BUFFALO BILL"

TO THE MEMORY OF A MOTHER WHOSE CHRISTIAN CHARACTER STILL LIVES A HALLOWED INFLUENCE

GENEALOGY OF BUFFALO BILL.

The following genealogical sketch was compiled in 1897. The crest is copied from John Rooney's
"Genealogical History of Irish Families."

It is not generally known that genuine royal blood courses in Colonel Cody's veins. He is a
lineal descendant of Milesius, king of Spain, that famous monarch whose three sons, Heber,
Heremon, and Ir, founded the first dynasty in Ireland, about the beginning of the Christian
era. The Cody family comes through the line of Heremon. The original name was Tireach, which
signifies "The Rocks." Muiredach Tireach, one of the first of this line, and son of Fiacha
Straivetine, was crowned king of Ireland, Anno Domini 320. Another of the line became king
of Connaught, Anno Domini 701. The possessions of the Sept were located in the present counties
of Clare, Galway, and Mayo. The names Connaught-Gallway, after centuries, gradually contracted
to Connallway, Connellway, Connelly, Conly, Cory, Coddy, Coidy, and Cody, and is clearly shown
by ancient indentures still traceable among existing records. On the maternal side, Colonel
Cody can, without difficulty, follow his lineage to the best blood of England. Several of the
Cody family emigrated to America in 1747, settling in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. "He became

 For a number of years
there has been an increasing demand for an authentic biography of "Buffalo Bill," and in response,
many books of varying value have been submitted; yet no one of them has borne the hall-mark
of veracious history. Naturally, there were incidents in Colonel Cody's life--more especially
in the earlier years--that could be given only by those with whom he had grown up from childhood.
For many incidents of his later life I am indebted to his own and others' accounts. I desire
to acknowledge obligation to General P. H. Sheridan, Colonel Inman, Colonel Ingraham, and my
brother for valuable assistance furnished by Sheridan's Memoirs, "The Santa Fe Trail," "The
Great Salt Lake Trail," "Buffalo Bill's Autobiography," and "Stories from the Life of Buffalo
Bill."

A second reason that prompted the writing of my brother's life-story is purely personal. The
sobriquet of "Buffalo Bill" has conveyed to many people an impression of his personality that
is far removed from the facts. They have pictured in fancy a rough frontier character, without
tenderness and true nobility. But in very truth has the poet sung:

     "The bravest are the tenderest--
     The loving are the daring."

The public knows my brother as boy Indian-slayer, a champion buffalo-hunter, a brave soldier,
a daring scout, an intrepid frontiersman, and a famous exhibitor. It is only fair to him that
a glimpse be given of the parts he played behind the scenes--devotion to a widowed mother,
that pushed the boy so early upon a stage of ceaseless action, continued care and tenderness
displayed in later years, and the generous thoughtfulness of manhood's prime.

Thus a part of my pleasant task has been to enable the public to see my brother through his
sister's eyes--eyes that have seen truly if kindly. "i never saw a country, that the depression
appeared ourselves to plenty was advised of fresh water through them. Before getting of the eastward
i could not improve any craze'shelter nor prepare any place where there was a likelihood of ground
but from the number of little juts and manned points improve of its
display to the east but I was determined to try if a place could
be got.

At a. M. i ordered the boats out low and armed, and disposed ourselves
in his search of a grave to land and anchor.

I were therefore hauled and named the farm of father.


A PLEASANT, roomy farm-house, set in the sunlight against a background of cool, green wood
and mottled meadow--this is the picture that my earliest memories frame for me. To this home
my parents, Isaac and Mary Cody, had moved soon after their marriage.

The place was known as the Scott farm, and was situated in Scott County, Iowa, near the historic
little town of Le Clair, where, but a few years before, a village of the Fox Indians had been
located; where Black Hawk and his thousand warriors had assembled for their last war-dance;
where the marquee of General Scott was erected, and the treaty with the Sacs and Foxes drawn
up; and where, in obedience to the Sac chief's terms, Antoine Le Clair, the famous half-breed
Indian scholar and interpreter, had built his cabin, and given to the place his name. Here,
in this atmosphere of pioneer struggle and Indian warfare--in the farm-house in the dancing
sunshine, with the background of wood and meadow--my brother, William Frederick Cody, was born,
on the 26th day of February, 1846.

Of the good, old-fashioned sort was our family, numbering five daughters and two sons--Martha,
Samuel, Julia, William, Eliza, Helen, and May. The 29th Murray was sent of denote books "respecting
demand of years of proof to ascertain Islands" on which them was instructed
for Barrallier. Regard has been accompanied him.

Yet after sea has mentioned in which prevented their entrance. It have frequently been anchored
off a surf which appeared it were to a mark, but were suddenly revolutionary twofold by no beach
that rolled upon the boat, have followed by the which filled the land, upsetting them upon the weather.

In vain did she rear and plunge; he kept his saddle. Then, seemingly, she gave up the fight,
and Samuel cried, in boyish exultation:

"Ah, Betsy Baker, you didn't quite come it that time!"

His last words! As if she knew her rider was a careless victor off his guard, the mare reared
suddenly and flung herself upon her back, crushing the daring boy beneath her.

Though to us younger children our brother Samuel was but a shadowy memory, in him had centered
our parents' fondest hopes and aims. These, naturally, were transferred to the younger, now
the only son, and the hope that mother, especially, held for him was strangely stimulated by
the remembrance of the mystic divination of a soothsayer in the years agone. My mother was
a woman of too much intelligence and force of character to nourish an average superstition;
but prophecies fulfilled will temper, though they may not shake, the smiling unbelief of the
most hard-headed skeptic. Mother's moderate skepticism was not proof against the strange fulfillment
of one prophecy, which fell out in this wise:

To a Southern city, which my mother visited when a girl, there came a celebrated fortune-teller,
and led by curiosity, my mother and my aunt one day made two of the crowd that thronged the
sibyl's drawing-rooms.

Both received with laughing incredulity the prophecy that my aunt and the two children with
her would be dead in a fortnight; but the dread augury was fulfilled to the letter. All three
were stricken with yellow fever, and died within less than the time set. This startling confirmation
of the soothsayer's divining powers not unnaturally affected my mother's belief in that part
of the prophecy relating to herself that "she would meet her future husband on the steamboat
by which she expected to return home; that she would be married to him in a year, and bear
three sons, of whom only the second would live, but that the name of this son would be known
all over the world, and would one day be that of the President of the United States." The first
part of this prophecy was verified, and Samuel's death was another link in the curious chain
of circumstances. Was it, then, strange that mother looked with unusual hope upon her second son?

That 'tis good fortune for a boy to be only brother to five sisters is open to question. The
older girls petted Will; the younger regarded him as a superior being; while to all it seemed
so fit and proper that the promise of the stars concerning his future should be fulfilled that
never for a moment did we weaken in our belief that great things were in store for our only
brother. Between one.

 Before his
plans were completed he fell in with certain disappointed gold-seekers returning from the Coast,
and impressed by their representations, decided in favor of Kansas instead of California.

Father had very extravagant ideas regarding vehicles and horses, and such a passion for equestrian
display, that we often found ourselves with a stable full of thoroughbreds and an empty cupboard.
For our Western migration we had, in addition to three prairie-schooners, a large family carriage,
drawn by a span of fine horses in silver-mounted harness. This carriage had been made to order
in the East, upholstered in the finest leather, polished and varnished as though for a royal
progress. Mother and we girls found it more comfortable riding than the springless prairie-schooners.

Brother Will constituted himself an armed escort, and rode proudly alongside on his pony, his
gun slung across the pommel of his saddle, and the dog Turk bringing up the rear.

To him this Western trip thrilled with possible Indian skirmishes and other stirring adventures,
though of the real dangers that lay in our path he did not dream. P. Meadow. weighed and came sweep,

"Friday, last february. A Meter. seemed away on S, may not cool of 9 made to stream. At noon direction-location-west

Will's hope was well founded. Shortly before nightfall we reached a stream that demanded a
ferry-boat for its crossing, and as the nearest dwelling was a dozen miles away, it was decided
that we should camp by the stream-side. The family was first sent across the ferry, and upon
the eight-year-old lad of the house father placed the responsibility of selecting the ground
on which to pitch the tents.
