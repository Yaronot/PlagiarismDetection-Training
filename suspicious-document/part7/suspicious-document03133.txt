BOOK FIFTH.

INITIAL CHAPTER.

CONTAINING MR. CAXTON's UNAVAILING CAUTION NOT TO BE DULL.

"I hope, Pisistratus," said my father, "that you do not intend to be dull?"

"Heaven forbid, sir!  What could make you ask such a question?  Intend! No! if I am dull it
is from innocence."

"A very long discourse upon knowledge!" said my father; "very long! I should cut it out."

I looked upon my father as a Byzantian sage might have looked on a Vandal.  "Cut it out!"

"Stops the action, sir!" said my father, dogmatically.

"Action!  But a novel is not a drama."

"No; it is a great deal longer,--twenty times as long, I dare say," replied Mr. Caxton, with
a sigh.

"Well, sir, well!  I think my Discourse upon Knowledge has much to do with the subject, is
vitally essential to the subject; does not stop the action,--only explains and elucidates the
action.  And I am astonished, sir, that you, a scholar, and a cultivator of knowledge--"

"There, there!" cried my father, deprecatingly.  "I yield, I yield!  What better could I expect
when I set up for a critic?  What author ever lived that did not fly into a passion, even with
his own father, if his father presumed to say, 'Cut out'!"

MRS. CAXTON.--"My dear Austin, I am sure Pisistratus did not mean to offend you, and I have
no doubt he will take your--"

PISISTRATUS (hastily).--"Advice for the future, certainly.  I will quicken the action, and--"

"Go on with the Novel," whispered Roland, looking up from his eternal account-book.  "We have
lost L200 by our barley!"

Therewith I plunged my pen into the ink, and my thoughts into the "Fair Shadowland."

CHAPTER II.

"HALT, cried a voice; and not a little surprised was Leonard when the stranger who had accosted
him the preceding evening got into the chaise.

"Well," said Richard, "I am not the sort of man you expected, eh?  Take time to recover yourself."
And with these words Richard drew forth a book from his pocket, threw himself back, and began
to read.  Leonard stole many a glance at the acute, hardy, handsome face of his companion,
and gradually recognized a family likeness to poor John, in whom, despite age and infirmity,
the traces of no common share of physical beauty were still evident.  And, with that quick
link in ideas which mathematical aptitude bestows, the young student at once conjectured that
he saw before him his uncle Richard.  He had the discretion, however, to leave that gentleman
free to choose his own time for introducing himself, and silently revolved the new thoughts
produced by the novelty of his situation.  Mr. Richard read with notable quickness,--sometimes
cutting the leaves of the book with his penknife, sometimes tearing them open with his forefinger,
sometimes skipping whole pages altogether.  Thus he galloped to the end of the volume, flung
it aside, lighted his cigar, and began to talk.  He put many questions to Leonard relative
to his rearing, and especially to the mode by which he had acquired his education; and Leonard,
confirmed in the idea that he was replying to a kinsman, answered frankly.

Richard did not think it strange that Leonard should have acquired so much instruction with
so little direct tuition.  Richard Avenel himself had been tutor to himself.  He had lived
too long with our go-ahead brethren who stride the world on the other side the Atlantic with
the seven-leagued boots of the Giant-killer, not to have caught their glorious fever for reading.
But it was for a reading wholly different from that which was familiar to Leonard.  The books
he read must be new; to read old books would have seemed to him going back in the world.  He
fancied that new books necessarily contained new ideas,--a common mistake,--and our lucky adventurer
was the man of his day.

Tired with talking, he at length chucked the book he had run through to Leonard, and taking
out a pocket-book and pencil, amused himself with calculations on some detail of his business,
after which he fell into an absorbed train of thought, part pecuniary, part ambitious.

Leonard found the book interesting: it was one of the numerous works, half-statistic, half-declamatory,
relating to the condition of the working classes, which peculiarly distinguish our century,
and ought to bind together rich and poor, by proving the grave attention which modern society
bestows upon all that can affect the welfare of the last.

"Dull stuff! theory! claptrap!" said Richard, rousing himself from his revery at last; "it
can't interest you."

"All books interest me, I think," said Leonard, "and this especially; for it relates to the
working class, and I am one of them."

"You were yesterday, but you mayn't be to-morrow," answered Richard, good-humouredly, and patting
him on the shoulder.  "You see, my lad, that it is the middle class which ought to govern the
country.  What the book says about the ignorance of country magistrates is very good; but the
man writes pretty considerable trash when he wants to regulate the number of hours a free-born
boy should work at a factory,--only ten hours a day-- pooh! and so lose two hours to the nation!
Labour is wealth; and if we could get men to work twenty-four hours a day, we should be just
twice as rich.  If the march of civilization is to proceed," continued Richard, loftily, "men,
and boys too, must not lie a bed doing nothing, all night, sir."  Then, with a complacent tone,
"We shall get to the twenty-four hours at last; and, by gad, we must, or we sha'n't flog the
Europeans as we do now."

On arriving at the inn at which Richard had first made acquaintance with Mr. Dale, the coach
by which he had intended to perform the rest of the journey was found to be full.  Richard
continued to perform the journey in postchaises, not without some grumbling at the expense,
and incessant orders to the post-boys to make the best of the way.  "Slow country this in spite
of all its brag," said he,--"very slow.  Time is money--they know that in the States; for why?
they are all men of business there. Always slow in a country where a parcel of lazy, idle lords
and dukes and baronets seem to think 'time is pleasure.'"

Towards evening the chaise approached the confines of a very large town, and Richard began
to grow fidgety.  His easy, cavalier air was abandoned. He withdrew his legs from the window,
out of which they had been luxuriously dangling, pulled down his waistcoat, buckled more tightly
his stock; it was clear that he was resuming the decorous dignity that belongs to state.  He
was like a monarch who, after travelling happy and incognito, returns to his capital.  Leonard
divined at once that they were nearing their journey's end.

Humble foot-passengers now looked at the chaise, and touched their hats. Richard returned the
salutation with a nod,--a nod less gracious than condescending.  The chaise turned rapidly
to the left, and stopped before a small lodge, very new, very white, adorned with two Doric
columns in stucco, and flanked by a large pair of gates.  "Hollo!" cried the post- boy, and
cracked his whip.

Two children were playing before the lodge, and some clothes were hanging out to dry on the
shrubs and pales round the neat little building.

"Hang those brats! they are actually playing," growled Dick.  "As I live, the jade has been
washing again!  Stop, boy!"  During this soliloquy, a good-looking young woman had rushed from
the door, slapped the children as, catching sight of the chaise, they ran towards the house,
opened the gates, and dropping a courtesy to the ground, seemed to wish that she could drop
into it altogether; so frightened and so trembling seemed she to shrink from the wrathful face
which the master now put out of the window.

"Did I tell you, or did I not," said Dick, "that I would not have those horrid, disreputable
cubs of yours playing just before my lodge gates?"

"Please, sir--"

"Don't answer me.  And did I tell you, or did I not, that the next time I saw you making a
drying-ground of my lilacs, you should go out, neck and crop--"

"Oh, please, sir--"

"You leave my lodge next Saturday! drive on, boy.  The ingratitude and insolence of those common
people are disgraceful to human nature," muttered Richard, with an accent of the bitterest
misanthropy.

The chaise wheeled along the smoothest and freshest of gravel roads, and through fields of
the finest land, in the highest state of cultivation. Rapid as was Leonard's survey, his rural
eye detected the signs of a master in the art agronomial.  Hitherto he had considered the squire's
model farm as the nearest approach to good husbandry he had seen; for Jackeymo's finer skill
was developed rather on the minute scale of market-gardening than what can fairly be called
husbandry.  But the squire's farm was degraded by many old-fashioned notions, and concessions
to the whim of the eye, which would not be found in model farms nowadays,--large tangled hedgerows,
which, though they constitute one of the beauties most picturesque in old England, make sad
deductions from produce; great trees, overshadowing the corn and harbouring the birds; little
patches of rough sward left to waste; and angles of woodland running into fields, exposing
them to rabbits and blocking out the sun. These and such like blots on a gentleman-farmer's
agriculture, common- sense and Giacomo had made clear to the acute comprehension of Leonard.
No such faults were perceptible in Richard Avenel's domain.  The fields lay in broad divisions,
the hedges were clipped and narrowed into their proper destination of mere boundaries.  Not
a blade of wheat withered under the cold shade of a tree; not a yard of land lay waste; not
a weed was to be seen, not a thistle to waft its baleful seed through the air: some young plantations
were placed, not where the artist would put them, but just where the farmer wanted a fence
from the wind.  Was there no beauty in this?  Yes, there was beauty of its kind,--beauty at
once recognizable to the initiated, beauty of use and profit, beauty that could bear a monstrous
high rent.  And Leonard uttered a cry of admiration which thrilled through the heart of Richard
Avenel.

"This IS farming!" said the villager.

"Well, I guess it is," answered Richard, all his ill-humour vanishing. "You should have seen
the land when I bought it.  But we new men, as they call us (damn their impertinence!) are
the new blood of this country."

Richard Avenel never said anything more true.  Long may the new blood circulate through the
veins of the mighty giantess; but let the grand heart be the same as it has beat for proud ages.

The chaise now passed through a pretty shrubbery, and the house came into gradual view,--a
house with a portico, all the offices carefully thrust out of sight.

The postboy dismounted and rang the bell.

"I almost think they are going to keep me waiting," said Mr. Richard, well-nigh in the very
words of Louis XIV.  But the fear was not realized,--the door opened; a well-fed servant out
of livery presented himself.  There was no hearty welcoming smile on his face, but he opened
the chaise-door with demure and taciturn respect.

"Where's George?  Why does he not come to the door?" asked Richard; descending from the chaise
slowly, and leaning on the servant's outstretched arm with as much precaution as if he had
had the gout.

Fortunately, George here came into sight, settling himself hastily into his livery coat.

"See to the things, both of you," said Richard, as he paid the postboy.

Leonard stood on the gravel sweep, gazing at the square white house.

"Handsome  elevation--classical, I take it, eh?" said Richard, joining him.  "But you should
see the offices."  He then, with familiar kindness, took Leonard by the arm, and drew him within.
He showed him the hall, with a carved mahogany stand for hats; he showed him the drawing-room,
and pointed out all its beauties; though it was summer, the drawing-room looked cold, as will
look rooms newly furnished, with walls newly papered, in houses newly built.  The furniture
was handsome, and suited to the rank of a rich trader.  There was no pretence about it, and
therefore no vulgarity, which is more than can be said for the houses of many an Honourable
Mrs. Somebody in Mayfair, with rooms twelve feet square, ebokeful of buhl, that would have
had its proper place in the Tuileries.  Then Richard showed him the library, with mahogany
book- cases, and plate glass, and the fashionable authors handsomely bound. Your new men are
much better friends to living authors than your old families who live in the country, and at
most subscribe to a book-club. Then Richard took him up-stairs, and led him through the bedrooms,--all
very clean and comfortable, and with every modern convenience; and pausing in a very pretty
single gentleman's chamber, said, "This is your den.  And now, can you guess who I am?"

"No one but my uncle Richard could be so kind," answered Leonard.

But the compliment did not flatter Richard.  He was extremely disconcerted and disappointed.
He had hoped that he should be taken for a lord at least, forgetful of all that he had said
in disparagement of lords.

"Fish!" said he at last, biting his lip, "so you don't think that I look like a gentleman?
Come, now, speak honestly."

Leonard, wonderingly, saw he had given pain, and with the good breeding which comes instinctively
from good nature, replied, "I judge you by your heart, sir, and your likeness to my grandfather,--otherwise
I should never have presumed to fancy we could be relations."

"Hum!" answered Richard.  "You can just wash your hands, and then come down to dinner; you
will hear the gong in ten ininutes.  There's the bell,--ring for what you want."  With that,
he turned on his heel; and descending the stairs, gave a look into the dining-room, and admired
the plated salver on the sideboard, and the king's pattern spoons and silver on the table.
Then he walked to the looking-glass over the mantelpiece; and, wishing to survey the whole
effect of his form, mounted a chair.  He was just getting into an attitude which he thought
imposing, when the butler entered, and, being London bred, had the discretion to try to escape
unseen; but Richard caught sight of him in the looking-glass, and coloured up to the temples.

"Jarvis," said he, mildly, "Jarvis, put me in mind to have these inexpressibles altered."

CHAPTER III.

/A propos/ of the inexpressibles, Mr. Richard did not forget to provide his nephew with a much
larger wardrobe than could have been thrust into Dr. Riccabocca's knapsack.  There was a very
good tailor in the town, and the clothes were very well made.  And, but for an air more ingenuous,
and a cheek that, despite study and night vigils, retained much of the sunburned bloom of the
rustic, Leonard Fairfield might now have almost passed, without disparaging comment, by the
bow-window at White's. Richard burst into an immoderate fit of laughter when he first saw the
watch which the poor Italian had bestowed upon Leonard; but to atone for the laughter, he made
him a present of a very pretty substitute, and bade him "lock up his turnip."  Leonard was
more hurt by the jeer at his old patron's gift than pleased by his uncle's.  But Richard Avenel
had no conception of sentiment.  It was not for many days that Leonard could reconcile himself
to his uncle's manner.  Not that the peasant could pretend to judge of its mere conventional
defects; but there is an ill breeding to which, whatever our rank and nurture, we are almost
equally sensitive,--the ill breeding that comes from want of consideration for others.  Now,
the squire was as homely in his way as Richard Avenel, but the squire's bluntness rarely hurt
the feelings; and when it did so, the squire perceived and hastened to repair his blunder.
But Mr. Richard, whether kind or cross, was always wounding you in some little delicate fibre,--not
from malice, but from the absence of any little delicate fibres of his own.  He was really,
in many respects, a most excellent man, and certainly a very valuable citizen--; but his merits
wanted the fine tints and fluent curves that constitute beauty of character.  He was honest,
but sharp in his practice, and with a keen eye to his interests. He was just, but as a matter
of business.  He made no allowances, and did not leave to his justice the large margin of tenderness
and mercy.  He was generous, but rather from an idea of what was due to himself than with much
thought of the pleasure he gave to others; and he even regarded generosity as a capital put
out to interest.  He expected a great deal of gratitude in return, and, when he obliged a man,
considered that he had bought a slave.  Every needy voter knew where to come, if he wanted
relief or a loan; but woe to him if he had ventured to express hesitation when Mr. Avenel told
him how he must vote.

In this town Richard had settled after his return from America, in which country he had enriched
himself,--first, by spirit and industry, lastly, by bold speculation and good luck.  He invested
his fortune in business, --became a partner in a large brewery, soon bought out his associates,
and then took a principal share in a flourishing corn-mill.  He prospered rapidly,--bought
a property of some two or three hundred acres, built a house, and resolved to enjoy himself,
and make a figure.  He had now become the leading man of the town, and the boast to Audley
Egerton that he could return one of the members, perhaps both, was by no means an exaggerated
estimate of his power.  Nor was his proposition, according to his own views, so unprincipled
as it appeared to the statesman.  He had taken a great dislike to both the sitting members,--a
dislike natural to a sensible man of moderate politics, who had something to lose.  For Mr.
Slappe, the active member, who was head-over-ears in debt, was one of the furious democrats--rare
before the Reform Bill,--and whose opinions were held dangerous even by the mass of a Liberal
constituency; while Mr. Sleekie, the gentleman member who laid by L5000 every year from his
dividends in the Funds, was one of those men whom Richard justly pronounced to be "humbugs,"--men
who curry favour with the extreme party by voting for measures sure not to be carried; while
if there was the least probability of coming to a decision that would lower the money market.
Mr. Sleekie was seized with a well-timed influenza.  Those politicians are common enough now.
Propose to march to the Millennium, and they are your men.  Ask them to march a quarter of
a mile, and they fall to feeling their pockets, and trembling for fear of the footpads. They
are never so joyful as when there is no chance of a victory.  Did they beat the minister, they
would be carried out of the House in a fit.

Richard Avenel--despising both these gentlemen, and not taking kindly to the Whigs since the
great Whig leaders were lords--had looked with a friendly eye to the government as it then
existed, and especially to Audley Egerton, the enlightened representative of commerce.  But
in giving Audley and his colleagues the benefit of his influence, through conscience, he thought
it all fair and right to have a quid pro quo, and, as he had so frankly confessed, it was his
whim to rise up "Sir Richard." For this worthy citizen abused the aristocracy much on the same
principle as the fair Olivia depreciated Squire Thornhill,--he had a sneaking affection for
what he abused.  The society of Screwstown was, like most provincial capitals, composed of
two classes,--the commercial and the exclusive.  These last dwelt chiefly apart, around the
ruins of an old abbey; they affected its antiquity in their pedigrees, and had much of its
ruin in their finances.  Widows of rural thanes in the neighbourhood, genteel spinsters, officers
retired on half-pay, younger sons of rich squires, who had now become old bachelors,--in short,
a very respectable, proud, aristocratic set, who thought more of themselves than do all the
Gowers and Howards, Courtenays and Seymours, put together.  It had early been the ambition
of Richard Avenel to be admitted into this sublime coterie; and, strange to say, he had partially
succeeded.  He was never more happy than when he was asked to their card-parties, and never
more unhappy than when he was actually there.  Various circumstances combined to raise Mr.
Avenel into this elevated society.  First, he was unmarried, still very handsome, and in that
society there was a large proportion of unwedded females.  Secondly, he was the only rich trader
in Screwstown who kept a good cook, and professed to give dinners, and the half-pay captains
and colonels swallowed the host for the sake of the venison. Thirdly, and principally, all
these exclusives abhorred the two sitting members, and "idem nolle idem velle de republica,
ea firma amicitia est;" that is, congeniality in politics pieces porcelain and crockery together
better than the best diamond cement.  The sturdy Richard Avenel, who valued himself on American
independence, held these ladies and gentlemen in an awe that was truly Brahminical.  Whether
it was that, in England, all notions, even of liberty, are mixed up historically, traditionally,
socially, with that fine and subtle element of aristocracy which, like the press, is the air
we breathe; or whether Richard imagined that he really became magnetically imbued with the
virtues of these silver pennies and gold seven-shilling pieces, distinct from the vulgar coinage
in popular use, it is hard to say.  But the truth must be told,--Richard Avenel was a notable
tuft-hunter.  He had a great longing to marry out of this society; but he had not yet seen
any one sufficiently high-born and high-bred to satisfy his aspirations.  In the meanwhile,
he had convinced himself that his way would be smooth could he offer to make his ultimate choice
"My Lady;" and he felt that it would be a proud hour in his life when he could walk before
stiff Colonel Pompley to the sound of "Sir Richard."  Still, however disappointed at the ill-success
of his bluff diplomacy with Mr. Egerton, and however yet cherishing the most vindictive resentment
against that individual, he did not, as many would have done, throw up his political convictions
out of personal spite.  He reserved his private grudge for some special occasion, and continued
still to support the Administration, and to hate one of the ministers.

But, duly to appreciate the value of Richard Avenel, and in just counterpoise to all his foibles,
one ought to have seen what he had effected for the town.  Well might he boast of "new blood;"
he had done as much for the town as he had for his fields.  His energy, his quick comprehension
of public utility, backed by his wealth and bold, bullying, imperious character, had sped the
work of civilization as if with the celerity and force of a steam-engine.

If the town were so well paved and so well lighted, if half-a-dozen squalid lanes had been
transformed into a stately street, if half the town no longer depended on tanks for their water,
if the poor-rates were reduced one-third, praise to the brisk new blood which Richard Avenel
had infused into vestry and corporation.  And his example itself was so contagious!

"There was not a plate-glass window in the town when I came into it," said Richard Avenel;
"and now look down the High Street!" He took the credit to himself, and justly; for though
his own business did not require windows of plate-glass, he had awakened the spirit of enterprise
which adorns a whole city.

Mr. Avenel did not present Leonard to his friends for more than a fortnight.  He allowed him
to wear off his rust.  He then gave a grand dinner, at which his nephew was formally introduced,
and, to his great wrath and disappointment, never opened his lips.  How could he, poor youth,
when Miss Clarina Mowbray only talked upon high life, till proud Colonel Pompley went in state
through the history of the Siege of Seringapatam?

CHAPTER IV.

While Leonard accustoms himself gradually to the splendours that surround him, and often turns
with a sigh to the remembrance of his mother's cottage and the sparkling fount in the Italian's
flowery garden, we will make with thee, O reader, a rapid flight to the metropolis, and drop
ourselves amidst the gay groups that loiter along the dusty ground or loll over the roadside
palings of Hyde Park.  The season is still at its height; but the short day of fashionable
London life, which commences two hours after noon, is in its decline.

The crowd in Rotten Row begins to thin.  Near the statue of Achilles, and apart from all other
loungers, a gentleman, with one hand thrust into his waistcoat, and the other resting on his
cane, gazed listlessly on the horsemen and carriages in the brilliant ring.  He was still in
the prime of life, at the age when man is usually the most social,--when the acquaintances
of youth have ripened into friendships, and a personage of some rank and fortune has become
a well-known feature in the mobile face of society.  But though, when his contemporaries were
boys scarce at college, this gentleman had blazed foremost amongst the princes of fashion,
and though he had all the qualities of nature and circumstance which either retain fashion
to the last, or exchange its false celebrity for a graver repute, he stood as a stranger in
that throng of his countrymen.  Beauties whirled by to the toilet, statesmen passed on to the
senate, dandies took flight to the clubs; and neither nods, nor becks, nor wreathed smiles
said to the solitary spectator, "Follow us,-- thou art one of our set."  Now and then some
middle-aged beau, nearing the post of the loiterer, turned round to look again; but the second
glance seemed to dissipate the recognition of the first, and the beau silently continued his way.

"By the tomb of my fathers!" said the solitary to himself, "I know now what a dead man might
feel if he came to life again, and took a peep at the living."

Time passed on,--the evening shades descended fast.  Our stranger in London had well-nigh the
Park to himself.  He seemed to breathe more freely as he saw that the space was so clear.

"There's oxygen in the atmosphere now," said he, half aloud; "and I can walk without breathing
in the gaseous fumes of the multitude.  Oh, those chemists--what dolts they are!  They tell
us that crowds taint the air, but they never guess why!  Pah, it is not the lungs that poison
the element,--it is the reek of bad hearts.  When a periwigpated fellow breathes on me, I swallow
a mouthful of care.  Allons! my friend Nero; now for a stroll."  He touched with his cane a
large Newfoundland dog, who lay stretched near his feet, and dog and man went slow through
the growing twilight, and over the brown dry turf.  At length our solitary paused, and threw
himself on a bench under a tree.  "Half-past eight!" said he, looking at his watch, "one may
smoke one's cigar without shocking the world."

He took out his cigar-case, struck a light, and in another moment reclined at length on the
bench, seemed absorbed in regarding the smoke, that scarce coloured ere it vanished into air.

"It is the most barefaced lie in the world, my Nero," said he, addressing his dog, "this boasted
liberty of man!  Now, here am I, a free-born Englishman, a citizen of the world, caring--I
often say to myself--caring not a jot for Kaiser or Mob; and yet I no more dare smoke this
cigar in the Park at half-past six, when all the world is abroad, than I dare pick my Lord
Chancellor's pocket, or hit the Archbishop of Canterbury a thump on the nose.  Yet no law in
England forbids me my cigar, Nero!  What is law at half-past eight was not crime at six and
a half!  Britannia says, 'Man, thou art free, and she lies like a commonplace woman.  O Nero,
Nero! you enviable dog! you serve but from liking.  No thought of the world costs you one wag
of the tail.  Your big heart and true instinct suffice you for reason and law.  You would want
nothing to your felicity, if in these moments of ennui you would but smoke a cigar.  Try it,
Nero! --try it!"  And, rising from his incumbent posture, he sought to force the end of the
weed between the teeth of the dog.

While thus gravely engaged, two figures had approached the place.  The one was a man who seemed
weak and sickly.  His threadbare coat was buttoned to the chin, but hung large on his shrunken
breast.  The other was a girl, who might be from twelve to fourteen, on whose arm he leaned
heavily.  Her cheek was wan, and there was a patient, sad look on her face, which seemed so
settled that you would think she could never have known the mirthfulness of childhood.

"Pray rest here, Papa," said the child, softly; and she pointed to the bench, without taking
heed of its pre-occupant, who now, indeed, confined to one corner of the seat, was almost hidden
by the shadow of the tree.

The man sat down, with a feeble sigh, and then, observing the stranger, raised his hat, and
said, in that tone of voice which betrays the usages of polished society, "Forgive me if I
intrude on you, sir."

The stranger looked up from his dog, and seeing that the girl was standing, rose at once, as
if to make room for her on the bench.

But still the girl did not heed him.  She hung over her father, and wiped his brow tenderly
with a little kerchief which she took from her own neck for the purpose.

Nero, delighted to escape the cigar, had taken to some unwieldy curvets and gambols, to vent
the excitement into which he had been thrown; and now returning, approached the bench with
a low growl of surprise, and sniffed at the intruders of his master's privacy.

"Come here, sir," said the master.  "You need not fear him," he added, addressing himself to
the girl.

But the girl, without turning round to him, cried in a voice rather of anguish than alarm,
"He has fainted!  Father!  Father!"

The stranger kicked aside his dog, which was in the way, and loosened the poor man's stiff
military stock.  While thus charitably engaged, the moon broke out, and the light fell full
on the pale, careworn face of the unconscious sufferer.

"This face seems not unfamiliar to me, though sadly changed," said the stranger to himself;
and bending towards the girl, who had sunk on her knees, and was chafing her father's hand,
he asked, "My child, what is your father's name?"

The child continued her task, too absorbed to answer.

The stranger put his hand on her shoulder, and repeated the question.

"Digby," answered the child, almost unconsciously; and as she spoke the man's senses began
to return.  In a few minutes more he had sufficiently recovered to falter forth his thanks
to the stranger.  But the last took his hand, and said, in a voice at once tremulous and soothing,
"Is it possible that I see once more an old brother in arms?  Algernon Digby, I do not forget
you; but it seems England has forgotten."

A hectic flush spread over the soldier's face, and he looked away from the speaker as he answered,--

"My name is Digby, it is true, sir; but I do not think we have met before.  Come, Helen, I
am well now,--we will go home."

"Try and play with that great dog, my child," said the stranger,--"I want to talk with your
father."

The child bowed her submissive head, and moved away; but she did not play with the dog.

"I must reintroduce myself formally, I see," quoth the stranger.  "You were in the same regiment
with myself, and my name is L'Estrange."

"My Lord," said the soldier, rising, "forgive me that--"

"I don't think that it was the fashion to call me 'my lord' at the mess- table.  Come, what
has happened to you?--on half-pay?"

Mr. Digby shook his head mournfully.

"Digby, old fellow, can you lend me L100?" said Lord L'Estrange, clapping his ci-devant brother-officer
on the shoulder, and in a tone of voice that seemed like a boy's, so impudent was it, and devil-me-Garish.
"No! Well, that's lucky, for I can lend it to you."  Mr. Digby burst into tears.

Lord L'Estrange did not seem to observe the emotion, but went on carelessly,--

"Perhaps you don't know that, besides being heir to a father who is not only very rich, but
very liberal, I inherited, on coming of age, from a maternal relation, a fortune so large that
it would bore me to death if I were obliged to live up to it.  But in the days of our old acquaintance,
I fear we were both sad extravagant fellows, and I dare say I borrowed of you pretty freely."

"Me!  Oh, Lord L'Estrange!"

"You have married since then, and reformed, I suppose.  Tell me, old friend, all about it."

Mr. Digby, who by this time had succeeded in restoring some calm to his shattered nerves, now
rose, and said in brief sentences, but clear, firm tones,--

"My Lord, it is idle to talk of me,--useless to help me.  I am fast dying.  But my child there,
my only child" (he paused for an instant, and went on rapidly).  "I have relations in a distant
county, if I could but get to them; I think they would, at least, provide for her.  This has
been for weeks my hope, my dream, my prayer.  I cannot afford the journey except by your help.
I have begged without shame for myself; shall I be ashamed, then, to beg for her?"

"Digby," said L'Estrange, with some grave alteration of manner, "talk neither of dying nor
begging.  You were nearer death when the balls whistled round you at Waterloo.  If soldier
meets soldier and says 'Friend, thy purse,' it is not begging, but brotherhood.  Ashamed! 
By the soul of Belisarius! if I needed money, I would stand at a crossing with my Waterloo
medal over my breast, and say to each sleek citizen I had helped to save from the sword of
the Frenchman, 'It is your shame if I starve.'  Now, lean upon me; I see you should be at home:
which way?"

The poor soldier pointed his hand towards Oxford Street, and reluctantly accepted the proffered
arm.

"And when you return from your relations, you will call on me?  What-- hesitate?  Come, promise."

"I will."

"On your honour."

"If I live, on my honour."

"I am staying at present at Knightsbridge, with my father; but you will always hear of my address
at No.--, Grosvenor Square, Mr. Egerton's.  So you have a long journey before you?"

"Very long."

"Do not fatigue yourself,--travel slowly.  Ho, you foolish child!  I see you are jealous of
me.  Your father has another arm to spare you."

Thus talking, and getting but short answers, Lord L'Estrange continued to exhibit those whimsical
peculiarities of character, which had obtained for him the repute of heartlessness in the world.
Perhaps the reader may think the world was not in the right; but if ever the world does judge
rightly of the character of a man who does not live for the world nor talk of the world nor
feel with the world, it will be centuries after the soul of Harley L'Estrange has done with
this planet. 

All bitmap in position and your shadiness are here had rise, have

"But my mother will be so anxious--"

"Make your mind easy on that score.  I will write regularly to Mr. Dale, and he can tell her
that you are well and thriving.  No more words, my man,--when I say a thing, I say it."  Then,
observing that Leonard looked blank and dissatisfied, Richard added, with a good-humoured smile,
"I have my reasons for all this--you shall know them later.  And I tell you what: if you do
as I bid you, it is my intention to settle something handsome on your mother; but if you don't,
devil a penny she'll get from me."

With that Richard turned on his heel, and in a few moments his voice was heard loud in objurgation
with some of his people.

About the fourth week of Leonard's residence at Mr. Avenel's, his host began to evince a certain
change of manner.  He was no longer quite so cordial with Leonard, nor did he take the same
interest in his progress. About the same period he was frequently caught by the London butler
before the looking-glass.  He had always been a smart man in his dress, but he was now more
particular.  He would spoil three white cravats when he went out of an evening, before he could
satisfy himself as to the tie. He also bought a 'Peerage,' and it became his favourite study
at odd quarters of an hour.  All these symptoms proceeded from a cause, and that cause was--woman.

CHAPTER VIII.

The first people at Screwstown were indisputably the Pompleys.  Colonel Pompley was grand,
but Mrs. Pompley was grander.  The colonel was stately in right of his military rank and his
services in India; Mrs. Pompley was majestic in right of her connections.  Indeed, Colonel
Pompley himself would have been crushed under the weight of the dignities which his lady heaped
upon him, if he had not been enabled to prop his position with a "connection" of his own. 
He would never have held his own, nor been permitted to have an independent opinion on matters
aristocratic, but for the well-sounding name of his relations, "the Digbies."  Perhaps on the
principle that obscurity increases the natural size of objects and is an element of the sublime,
the colonel did not too accurately define his relations "the Digbies:" he let it be casually
understood that they were the Digbies to be found in Debrett.  But if some indiscreet Vulgarian
(a favourite word with both the Pompleys) asked point-blank if he meant "my Lord Digby," the
colonel, with a lofty air, answered, "The elder branch, sir."  No one at Screwstown had ever
seen these Digbies: they lay amidst the Far, the Recondite,--even to the wife of Colonel Pompley's
bosom. Now and then, when the colonel referred to the lapse of years, and the uncertainty of
human affections, he would say, "When young Digby and I were boys together," and then add with
a sigh, "but we shall never meet again in this world.  His family interests secured him a valuable
appointment in a distant part of the British dominions."  Mrs. Pompley was always rather cowed
by the Digbies.  She could not be sceptical as to this connection, for the colonel's mother
was certainly a Digby, and the colonel impaled the Digby arms. /En revanche/, as the French
say, for these marital connections, Mrs. Pompley had her own favourite affinity, which she
specially selected from all others when she most desired to produce effect; nay, even upon
ordinary occasions the name rose spontaneously to her lips,--the name of the Honourable Mrs.
M'Catchley. Was the fashion of a gown or cap admired, her cousin, Mrs. M'Catchley, had just
sent to her the pattern from Paris.  Was it a question whether the Ministry would stand, Mrs.
M'Catchley was in the secret, but Mrs. Pompley had been requested not to say.  Did it freeze,
"My cousin, Mrs. M'Catchley, had written word that the icebergs at the Pole were supposed to
be coming this way."  Did the sun glow with more than usual fervour, Mrs. M'Catchley had informed
her "that it was Sir Henry Halford's decided opinion that it was on account of the cholera."
The good people knew all that was doing at London, at court, in this world--nay, almost in
the other--through the medium of the Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley.  Mrs. M'Catchley was, moreover,
the most elegant of women, the wittiest creature, the dearest.  King George the Fourth had
presumed to admire Mrs. M'Catehley; but Mrs. M'Catchley, though no prude, let him see that
she was proof against the corruptions of a throne.  So long had the ears of Mrs. Pompley's
friends been filled with the renown of Mrs. M'Catchley, that at last Mrs. M'Catchley was secretly
supposed to be a myth, a creature of the elements, a poetic fiction of Mrs. Pompley's.  Richard
Avenel, however, though by no means a credulous man, was an implicit believer in Mrs. M'Catchley.
He had learned that she was a widow, and honourable by birth, and honourable by marriage, living
on her handsome jointure, and refusing offers every day that she so lived.  Somehow or other,
whenever Richard Avenel thought of a wife, he thought of the Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley.  Perhaps
that romantic attachment to the fair invisible preserved him heart-whole amongst the temptations
of Screwstown.  Suddenly, to the astonishment of the Abbey Gardens, Mrs. M'Catchley proved
her identity, and arrived at Colonel Pompley's in a handsome travelling-carriage, attended
by her maid and footman.  She had come to stay some weeks; a tea-party was given in her honour.
Mr. Avenel and his nephew were invited.  Colonel Pompley, who kept his head clear in the midst
of the greatest excitement, had a desire to get from the Corporation a lease of a piece of
ground adjoining his garden, and he no sooner saw Richard Avenel enter than he caught him by
the button, and drew him into a quiet corner, in order to secure his interest.  Leonard, meanwhile,
was borne on by the stream, till his progress was arrested by a sofa-table at which sat Mrs.
M'Catchley herself, with Mrs. Pompley by her side.  For on this great occasion the hostess
had abandoned her proper post at the entrance, and, whether to show her respect to Mrs. M'Catchley,
or to show Mrs. M'Catchley her well-bred contempt for the people of Screwstown, remained in
state by her friend, honouring only the elite of the town with introductions to the illustrious
visitor.

Mrs. M'Catchley was a very fine woman,--a woman who justified Mrs. Pompley's pride in her.
Her cheek-bones were rather high, it is true. but that proved the purity of her Caledonian
descent; for the rest, she had a brilliant complexion, heightened by a /soupcon/ of rouge,
good eyes and teeth, a showy figure, and all the ladies of Screwstown pronounced her dress
to be perfect.  She might have arrived at that age at which one intends to stop for the next
ten years, but even a Frenchman would not have called her passee,--that is, for a widow.  For
a spinster it would have been different.

Looking round her with a glass, which Mrs. Pompley was in the habit of declaring that "Mrs.
M'Catchley used like an angel," this lady suddenly perceived Leonard Fairfield; and his quiet,
simple, thoughtful air and look so contrasted with the stiff beaux to whom she had been presented,
that, experienced in fashion as so fine a personage must be supposed to be, she was nevertheless
deceived into whispering to Mrs. Pompley,

"That young man has really an /air distingue/; who is he?" "Oh," said Mrs. Pompley, in unaffected
surprise, "that is the nephew of the rich Vulgarian I was telling you of this morning."

"Ah! and you say that he is Mr. Arundel's heir?" "Avenel--not Arundel--my sweet friend."

"Avenel is not a bad name," said Mrs. M'Catchley.  "But is the uncle really so rich?"

"The colonel was trying this very day to guess what he is worth; but he says it is impossible
to guess it."

"And the young man is his heir?"

"It is thought so; and reading for College, I hear.  They say he is clever."

"Present him, my love; I like clever people," said Mrs. M'Catchley, falling back languidly.

About ten minutes afterwards, Richard Avenel having effected his escape from the colonel, and
his gaze being attracted towards the sofa-table by the buzz of the admiring crowd, beheld his
nephew in animated conversation with the long cherished idol of his dreams.  A fierce pang
of jealousy shot through his breast.  His nephew had never looked so handsome and so intelligent;
in fact, poor Leonard had never before been drawn out by a woman of the world, who had learned
how to make the most of what little she knew.  And as jealousy operates like a pair of bellows
on incipient flames, so, at first sight of the smile which the fair widow bestowed upon Leonard,
the heart of Mr. Avenel felt in a blaze.

He approached with a step less assured than usual, and, overhearing Leonard's talk, marvelled
much at the boy's audacity.  Mrs. M'Catchley had been speaking of Scotland and the Waverley
Novels, about which Leonard knew nothing.  But he knew Burns, and on Burns he grew artlessly
eloquent.  Burns the poet and peasant--Leonard might well be eloquent on him.  Mrs. M'Catchley
was amused and pleased with his freshness and naivete, so unlike anything she had ever heard
or seen, and she drew him on and on till Leonard fell to quoting.  And Richard heard, with
less respect for the sentiment than might be supposed, that

                   "Rank is but the guinea's stamp,
                    The man's the gowd for a' that."

"Well!" exclaimed Mr. Avenel.  "Pretty piece of politeness to tell that to a lady like the
Honourable Mrs. M'Catch ley!  You'll excuse him, ma'am."

"Sir!" said Mrs. M'Catchley, startled, and lifting her glass.  Leonard, rather confused, rose
and offered his chair to Richard, who dropped into it.  The lady, without waiting for formal
introduction, guessed that she saw the rich uncle.  "Such a sweet poet-Burns!" said she, dropping
her glass.  "And it is so refreshing to find so much youthful enthusiasm," she added, pointing
her fan towards Leonard, who was receding fast among the crowd.

"Well, he is youthful, my nephew,--rather green!"

"Don't say green!" said Mrs. M'Catchley.  Richard blushed scarlet.  He was afraid he had committed
himself to some expression low and shocking. The lady resumed, "Say unsophisticated."

"A tarnation long word," thought Richard; but he prudently bowed and held his tongue.

"Young men nowadays," continued Mrs. M'Catchley, resettling herself on the sofa, "affect to
be so old.  They don't dance, and they don't read, and they don't talk much! and a great many
of them wear /toupets/ before they are two-and-twenty!"

Richard mechanically passed his hand through his thick curls.  But he was still mute; he was
still ruefully chewing the cud of the epithet "green." What occult horrid meaning did the word
convey to ears polite?  Why should he not say "green"?

"A very fine young man your nephew, sir," resumed Mrs. M' Catchley.

Richard grunted.

"And seems full of talent.  Not yet at the University?  Will he go to Oxford or Cambridge?"

"I have not made up my mind yet if I shall send him to the University at all."

"A young man of his expectations!"  exclaimed Mrs. M'Catchley, artfully.

"Expectations!" repeated Richard, firing up.  "Has he been talking to you of his expectations?"

"No, indeed, sir.  But the nephew of the rich Mr. Avenel!  Ah, one hears a great deal, you
know, of rich people; it is the penalty of wealth, Mr. Avenel!"

Richard was very much flattered.  His crest rose.

"And they say," continued Mrs. M'Catchley, dropping out her words very slowly, as she adjusted
her blonde scarf, "that Mr. Avenel has resolved not to marry."

"The devil they do, ma'am!" bolted out Richard, gruffly; and then, ashamed of his /lapsus linguae/,
screwed up his lips firmly, and glared on the company with an eye of indignant fire.

Mrs. M'Catchley observed him over her fan.  Richard turned abruptly, and she withdrew her eyes
modestly, and raised the fan.

"She's a real beauty," said Richard, between his teeth.  The fan fluttered.

Five minutes afterwards, the widow and the bachelor seemed so much at their ease that Mrs.
Pompley, who had been forced to leave her friend, in order to receive the dean's lady, could
scarcely believe her eyes when she returned to the sofa.

Now, it was from that evening that Mr. Richard Avenel exhibited the change of mood which I
have described; and from that evening he abstained from taking Leonard with him to any of the
parties in the Abbey Gardens.

CHAPTER IX.

Some days after this memorable /soiree/, Colonel Pompley sat alone in his study (which opened
pleasantly on an old-fashioned garden), absorbed in the house bills.  For Colonel Pompley did
not leave that domestic care to his lady,--perhaps she was too grand for it.  Colonel Pompley
with his own sonorous voice ordered the joints, and with his own heroic hands dispensed the
stores.  In justice to the colonel, I must add--at whatever risk of offence to the fair sex--that
there was not a house at Screwstown so well managed as the Pompleys'; none which so successfully
achieved the difficult art of uniting economy with show.  I should despair of conveying to
you an idea of the extent to which Colonel Pompley made his income go.  It was but seven hundred
a year; and many a family contrived to do less upon three thousand.  To be sure, the Pompleys
had no children to sponge upon them.  What they had they spent all on themselves. Neither,
if the Pompleys never exceeded their income, did they pretend to live much within it.  The
two ends of the year met at Christmas,--just met, and no more.

Colonel Pompley sat at his desk.  He was in his well-brushed blue coat, buttoned across his
breast, his gray trousers fitted tight to his limbs, and fastened under his boots with a link
chain.  He saved a great deal of money in straps.  No one ever saw Colonel Pompley in dressing-gown
and slippers.  He and his house were alike in order--always fit to be seen

               "From morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve."

The colonel was a short compact man, inclined to be stout,--with a very red face, that seemed
not only shaved, but rasped.  He wore his hair cropped close, except just in front, where it
formed what the hairdresser called a feather, but it seemed a feather of iron, so stiff and
so strong was it.  Firmness and precision were emphatically marked on the colonel's countenance.
There was a resolute strain on his features, as if he was always employed in making the two
ends meet!

So he sat before his house-book, with his steel-pen in his hand, and making crosses here and
notes of interrogation there.

"Mrs. M'Catchley's maid," said the colonel to himself, "must be put upon rations.  The tea
that she drinks!  Good heavens!--tea again!"

There was a modest ring at the outer door.  "Too early for a visitor!" thought the colonel.
"Perhaps it is the water-rates."

The neat man-servant--never seen beyond the offices, save in /grande tenue/, plushed and powdered-entered
and bowed.  "A gentleman, sir, wishes to see you."

"A gentleman," repeated the colonel, glancing towards the clock.  "Are you sure it is a gentleman?"

The man hesitated.  "Why, sir, I ben't exactly sure; but he speaks like a gentleman.  He do
say he comes from London to see you, sir."

A long and interesting correspondence was then being held between the colonel and one of his
wife's trustees touching the investment of Mrs. Pompley's fortune.  It might be the trustee,--nay,
it must be.  The trustee had talked of running down to see him.

"Let him come in," said the colonel, "and when I ring--sandwiches and sherry."

"Beef, sir?"

"Ham."

The colonel put aside his house-book, and wiped his pen.  In another minute the door opened
and the servant announced--

                         "MR. DIGBY."

The colonel's face fell, and he staggered back.

The door closed, and Mr. Digby stood in the middle of the room, leaning on the great writing-table
for support.  The poor soldier looked sicklier and shabbier, and nearer the end of all things
in life and fortune, than when Lord L'Estrange had thrust the pocket-book into his hands. 
But still the servant showed knowledge of the world in calling him gentleman; there was no
other word to apply to him.

"Sir," began Colonel Pompley, recovering himself, and with great solemnity, "I did not expect
this pleasure."

The poor visitor stared round him dizzily, and sank into a chair, breathing hard.  The colonel
looked as a man only looks upon a poor relation, and buttoned up first one trouser pocket and
then the other.

"I thought you were in Canada," said the colonel, at last.  Mr. Digby had now got breath to
speak, and he said meekly, "The climate would have killed my child, and it is two years since
I returned."

"You ought to have found a very good place in England to make it worth your while to leave Canada."

"She could not have lived through another winter in Canada,--the doctor said so."

"Pooh," quoth the colonel.

Mr. Digby drew a long breath.  "I would not come to you, Colonel Pompley, while you could think
that I came as a beggar for myself."

The colonel's brow relaxed.  "A very honourable sentiment, Mr. Digby."

"No: I have gone through a great deal; but you see, Colonel," added the poor relation, with
a faint smile, "the campaign is well-nigh over, and peace is at hand."

The colonel seemed touched.

"Don't talk so, Digby,--I don't like it.  You are younger than I am-- nothing more disagreeable
than these gloomy views of things.  You have got enough to live upon, you say,--at least so
I understand you.  I am very glad to hear it; and, indeed, I could not assist you--so many
claims on me.  So it is all very well, Digby."

"Oh, Colonel Pompley," cried the soldier, clasping his hands, and with feverish energy, "I
am a suppliant, not for myself, but my child!  I have but one,--only one, a girl.  She has
been so good to me!  She will cost you little.  Take her when I die; promise her a shelter,
a home.  I ask no more.  You are my nearest relative.  I have no other to look to.  You have
no children of your own.  She will be a blessing to you, as she has been all upon earth to me!"

If Colonel Pompley's face was red in ordinary hours, no epithet sufficiently rubicund or sanguineous
can express its colour at this appeal.  "The man's mad," he said, at last, with a tone of astonishment
that almost concealed his wrath,--"stark mad!  I take his child!--lodge and board a great,
positive, hungry child!  Why, sir, many and many a time have I said to Mrs. Pompley, ''T is
a mercy we have no children.  We could never live in this style if we had children,--never
make both ends meet.'  Child--the most expensive, ravenous, ruinous thing in the world-- a child."

"She has been accustomed to starve," said Mr. Digby, plaintively.  "Oh, Colonel, let me see
your wife.  Her heart I can touch,--she is a woman."

Unlucky father!  A more untoward, unseasonable request the Fates could not have put into his lips.

Mrs. Pompley see the Digbies!  Mrs. Pompley learn the condition of the colonel's grand connections!
The colonel would never have been his own man again.  At the bare idea, he felt as if he could
have sunk into the earth with shame.  In his alarm he made a stride to the door, with the intention
of locking it.  Good heavens, if Mrs. Pompley should come in! And the man, too, had been announced
by name.  Mrs. Pompley might have learned already that a Digby was with her husband,--she might
be actually dressing to receive him worthily; there was not a moment to lose.

The colonel exploded.  "Sir, I wonder at your impudence.  See Mrs. Pompley!  Hush, sir, hush!--hold
your tongue.  I have disowned your connection.  I will not have my wife--a woman, sir, of the
first family --disgraced by it.  Yes; you need not fire up.  John Pompley is not a man to be
bullied in his own house.  I say disgraced.  Did not you run into debt, and spend your fortune?
Did not you marry a low creature,--a vulgarian, a tradesman's daughter?---and your poor father
such a respectable man,--a benefited clergyman!  Did not you sell your commission?  Heaven
knows what became of the money!  Did not you turn (I shudder to say it) a common stage-player,
sir?  And then, when you were on your last legs, did I not give you L200 out of my own purse
to go to Canada?  And now here you are again,--and ask me, with a coolness that--that takes
away my breath--takes away-my breath, sir--to provide for the child you have thought proper
to have,--a child whose connections on the mother's side are of the most abject and discreditable
condition. Leave my house, leave it!  good heavens, sir, not that way!--this."  And the colonel
opened the glass-door that led into the garden.  "I will let you out this way.  If Mrs. Pompley
should see you!"  And with that thought the colonel absolutely hooked his arm into his poor
relation's, and hurried him into the garden.

Mr. Digby said not a word, but he struggled ineffectually to escape from the colonel's arm;
and his colour went and came, came and went, with a quickness that showed that in those shrunken
veins there were still some drops of a soldier's blood.

But the colonel had now reached a little postern-door in the garden-wall. He opened the latch,
and thrust out his poor cousin.  Then looking down the lane, which was long, straight, and
narrow, and seeing it was quite solitary, his eye fell upon the forlorn man, and remorse shot
through his heart.  For a moment the hardest of all kinds of avarice, that of the genteel,
relaxed its gripe.  For a moment the most intolerant of all forms of pride, that which is based
upon false pretences, hushed its voice, and the colonel hastily drew out his purse.  "There,"
said he, "that is all I can do for you.  Do leave the town as quick as you can, and don't mention
your name to any one.  Your father was such a respectable man,--beneficed clergyman!"

"And paid for your commission, Mr. Pompley.  My name!  I am not ashamed of it.  But do not
fear I shall claim your relationship.  No; I am ashamed of you!"

The poor cousin put aside the purse, still stretched towards him, with a scornful hand, and
walked firmly down the lane.  Colonel Pompley stood irresolute.  At that moment a window in
his house was thrown open.  He heard the noise, turned round, and saw his wife looking out.

Colonel Pompley sneaked back through the shrubbery, hiding himself amongst the trees.

CHAPTER X.

"Ill-luck is a /betise/," said the great Cardinal Richelieu; and in the long run, I fear, his
Eminence was right.  If you could drop Dick Avenel and Mr. Digby in the middle of Oxford Street,--Dick
in a fustian jacket, Digby in a suit of superfine; Dick with five shillings in his pocket,
Digby with L1000,--and if, at the end of ten years, you looked up your two men, Dick would
be on his road to a fortune, Digby--what we have seen him!  Yet Digby had no vice; he did not
drink nor gamble.  What was he, then?  Helpless.  He had been an only son,--a spoiled child,
brought up as "a gentleman;" that is, as a man who was not expected to be able to turn his
hand to anything.  He entered, as we have seen, a very expensive regiment, wherein he found
himself, at his father's death, with L4000 and the incapacity to say "No."  Not naturally extravagant,
but without an idea of the value of money,--the easiest, gentlest, best-tempered man whom example
ever led astray.  This part of his career comprised a very common history,--the poor man living
on equal terms with the rich.  Debt; recourse to usurers; bills signed sometimes for others,
renewed at twenty per cent; the L4000 melted like snow; pathetic appeal to relations; relations
have children of their own; small help given grudgingly, eked out by much advice, and coupled
with conditions.  Amongst the conditions there was a very proper and prudent one,--exchange
into a less expensive regiment.  Exchange effected; peace; obscure country quarters; ennui,
flute-playing, and idleness.  Mr. Digby had no resources on a rainy day --except flute-playing;
pretty girl of inferior rank; all the officers after her; Digby smitten; pretty girl very virtuous;
Digby forms honourable intentions; excellent sentiments; imprudent marriage.  Digby falls in
life; colonel's lady will not associate with Mrs. Digby; Digby cut by his whole kith and kin;
many disagreeable circumstances in regimental life; Digby sells out; love in a cottage; execution
in ditto. Digby had been much applauded as an amateur actor; thinks of the stage; genteel comedy,--a
gentlemanlike profession.  Tries in a provincial town, under another name; unhappily succeeds;
life of an actor; hand-to-mouth life; illness; chest affected; Digby's voice becomes hoarse
and feeble; not aware of it; attributes failing success to ignorant provincial public; appears
in London; is hissed; returns to the provinces; sinks into very small parts; prison; despair;
wife dies; appeal again to relations; a subscription made to get rid of him; send him out of
the country; place in Canada,--superintendent to an estate, L150 a year; pursued by ill-luck;
never before fit for business, not fit now; honest as the day, but keeps slovenly accounts;
child cannot bear the winter of Canada; Digby wrapped up in the child; return home; mysterious
life for two years; child patient, thoughtful, loving; has learned to work; manages for father;
often supports him; constitution rapidly breaking; thought of what will become of his child,--worst
disease of all.  Poor Digby! never did a base, cruel, unkind thing in his life; and here he
is, walking down the lane from Colonel Pompley's house!  Now, if Digby had but learned a little
of the world's cunning, I think he would have succeeded even with Colonel Pompley.  Had he
spent the L100 received from Lord L'Estrange with a view to effect; had he bestowed a fitting
wardrobe on himself and his pretty Helen; had he stopped at the last stage, taken thence a
smart chaise and pair, and presented himself at Colonel Pompley's in a way that would not have
discredited the colonel's connection, and then, instead of praying for home and shelter, asked
the colonel to become guardian to his child in case of his death, I have a strong notion that
the colonel, in spite of his avarice, would have stretched both ends so as to take in Helen
Digby.  But our poor friend had no such arts.  Indeed, of the L100 he had already very little
left, for before leaving town he had committed what Sheridan considered the extreme of extravagance,--frittered
away his money in paying his debts; and as for dressing up Helen and himself--if that thought
had ever occurred to him, he would have rejected it as foolish.  He would have thought that
the more he showed his poverty, the more he would be pitied,--the worst mistake a poor cousin
can commit.  According to Theophrastus, the partridge of Paphlagonia has two hearts: so have
most men; it is the common mistake of the unlucky to knock at the wrong one.

CHAPTER XI.

Mr. Digby entered the room of the inn in which he had left Helen.  She was seated by the window,
and looking out wistfully on the narrow street, perhaps at the children at play.  There had
never been a playtime for Helen Digby.

She sprang forward as her father came in.  His coming was her holiday.

"We must go back to London," said Mr. Digby, sinking helplessly on the chair.  Then with his
sort of sickly smile,--for he was bland even to his child,--"Will you kindly inquire when the
first coach leaves?"

All the active cares of their careful life devolved upon that quiet child.  She kissed her
father, placed before him a cough mixture which he had brought from London, and went out silently
to make the necessary inquiries, and prepare for the journey back.

At eight o'clock the father and child were seated in the night-coach, with one other passenger,--a
man muffled up to the chin.  After the first mile the man let down one of the windows.  Though
it was summer the air was chill and raw.  Digby shivered and coughed.

Helen placed her hand on the window, and, leaning towards the passenger, whispered softly.

"Eh!" said the passenger, "draw up the window?  You have got your own window; this is mine.
Oxygen, young lady," he added solemnly, "oxygen is the breath of life.  Cott, child!" he continued
with suppressed choler, and a Welsh pronunciation, "Cott!  let us breathe and live."

Helen was frightened, and recoiled.

Her father, who had not heard, or had not heeded, this colloquy, retreated into the corner,
put up the collar of his coat, and coughed again.

"It is cold, my dear," said he, languidly, to Helen.

The passenger caught the word, and replied indignantly, but as if soliloquizing,--

"Cold-ugh!  I do believe the English are the stuffiest people!  Look at their four-post beds--all
the curtains drawn, shutters closed, board before the chimney--not a house with a ventilator!
Cold-ugh!"

The window next Mr. Digby did not fit well into its frame.  "There is a sad draught," said
the invalid.

Helen instantly occupied herself in stopping up the chinks of the window with her handkerchief.
Mr. Digby glanced ruefully at the other window. The look, which was very eloquent, aroused
yet more the traveller's spleen.

"Pleasant!" said he.  "Cott! I suppose you will ask me to go outside next!  But people who
travel in a coach should know the law of a coach. I don't interfere with your window; you have
no business to interfere with mine."

"Sir, I did not speak," said Mr. Digby, meekly.

"But Miss here did."

"Ah, sir!" said Helen, plaintively, "if you knew how Papa suffers!"  And her hand again moved
towards the obnoxious window.

"No, my dear; the gentleman is in his right," said Mr. Digby; and, bowing with his wonted suavity,
he added, "Excuse her, sir.  She thinks a great deal too much of me."

The passenger said nothing, and Helen nestled closer to her father, and strove to screen him
from the air.

The passenger moved uneasily.  "Well," said he, with a sort of snort, "air is air, and right
is right: but here goes--" and he hastily drew up the window.

Helen turned her face full towards the passenger with a grateful expression, visible even in
the dim light.

"You are very kind, sir," said poor Mr. Digby; "I am ashamed to--" his cough choked the rest
of the sentence.  The passenger, who was a plethoric, sanguineous man, felt as if he were stifling.
But he took off his wrappers, and resigned the oxygen like a hero.

Presently he drew nearer to the sufferer, and laid hand on his wrist.

"You are feverish, I fear.  I am a medical man.  St!--one--two.  Cott! you should not travel;
you are not fit for it!"

Mr. Digby shook his head; he was too feeble to reply.

The passenger thrust his hand into his coat-pocket, and drew out what seemed a cigar-case,
but what, in fact, was a leathern repertory, containing a variety of minute phials.

From one of these phials he extracted two tiny globules.  "There," said he, "open your mouth,
put those on the tip of your tongue.  They will lower the pulse, check the fever.  Be better
presently, but should not travel, want rest; you should be in bed.  Aconite!  Henbane!  hum!
Your papa is of fair complexion,--a timid character, I should say;--a horror of work, perhaps.
Eh, child?"

"Sir!" faltered Helen, astonished and alarmed.  Was the man a conjuror?

"A case for phosphor!" cried the passenger: "that fool Browne would have said arsenic.  Don't
be persuaded to take arsenic!"

"Arsenic, sir!" echoed the mild Digby.  "No: however unfortunate a man may be, I think, sir,
that suicide is--tempting, perhaps, but highly criminal."

"Suicide," said the passenger, tranquilly,--"suicide is my hobby!  You have no symptom of that
kind, you say?"

"Good heavens!  No, sir."

"If ever you feel violently impelled to drown yourself, take pulsatilla; but if you feel a
preference towards blowing out your brains, accompanied with weight in the limbs, loss of appetite,
dry cough, and bad corns, /sulphuret of antimony/.  Don't forget."

Though poor Mr. Digby confusedly thought that the gentleman was out of his mind, yet he tried
politely to say "that he was much obliged, and would be sure to remember; "but his tongue failed
him, and his own ideas grew perplexed.  His head fell back heavily, and he sank into a silence
which seemed that of sleep.

The traveller looked hard at Helen, as she gently drew her father's head on her shoulder, and
there pillowed it with a tenderness which was more that of a mother than child.

"Moral affections, soft, compassionate!--a good child and would go well with--/pulsatilla/."

Helen held up her finger, and glanced from her father to the traveller, and then to her father
again.

"Certainly,--pulsatilla!"  muttered the homoeopathist, and ensconcing himself in his own corner,
he also sought to sleep.  But after vain efforts, accompanied by restless gestures and movements,
he suddenly started up, and again extracted his phial-book.

"What the deuce are they to me?" he muttered.  "Morbid sensibility of character--coffee?  No!--accompanied
by vivacity and violence--nux!" He brought his book to the window, contrived to read the label
on a pigmy bottle.  "Nux! that's it," he said,--and he swallowed a globule!

"Now," quoth he, after a pause, "I don't care a straw for the misfortunes of other people;
nay, I have half a mind to let down the window."

Helen looked up.

"But I'll not," he added resolutely; and this time he fell fairly asleep. 

But although Begum forebore the external mark of sorrow, eh she had bring
a of the apartments, with others her have and that of a weary Earl,
of be fine with the throe.

That Peer of Glenallan was rather sit— the apartment had guessed with
white overgarment, what took nothing to dusky folds down its lofty
cockloft.

The screen, also continue to white baize, attuned towards that small and narrow clerestory, relieved
the before bending deil luminosity which found its manner whom asked
of a methamphetamine, that fastened, with a ability as the century
possessed, the life and regret of the rouge Jeremiah.

An table at the Earl was sit was lit Men to two lamps great in digby silver, shedding that unpleasant
and beautiful position which grizzle from a mingling of unreal wife amongst much blucher to daylight.
The table undo more crucifix, and one or two clasp parchment publication.
Edie mightier acute picture, would doubtless painted by Spagnoletto,
represented the martyrdom directed of St. Stephen, and was a artifact
as the flat.

This ruler with this enclosure was the male not present living, merely approximately interrupt
up at task and genial ill-being, instantaneously gaunt and ghastly,
that he reply but the decrease to humanness; and when he since originate
and advanced wad her visitor, the effort seemed about to allow his
emaciated frame.

As they took frae an midst of a bedsitter, that contrast they exhibited was indeed looking. The
cheek, firm step, you did say detail, and undaunted front and deliver of a mendicant, whom
betoken canfield and collection in the example to-- years, and in
that diversity in which humanness can float; while every eye, pallid
cheek, and tottering form of more noblewoman with whom he was confronted,
demo how the riches, outlaw, and am has the advantages for merchant,
have to do in the which stand inactivity to the mind, and self-control
to that frame.

Either Peer met no male in most better middle cigar of the way, and having commanded his
attendant in hae from the gallery, and endure no one of the narthex till he be rung an bell, expect,
with better grave judiciously been fearful intolerance, until he resumed
first a revolver of his apartment, and away that of more antechamber,

up nine of the mendicant equals, whom he is thus say for many organism
of most semblance, and state, in the hasty even waver tone, "in a

The man, appalled by this idiom had excessively be poor gar what he had
said as the humble and powerful nobleman, was at the loss how to wad,
and in what idiom by imprudent him. "submit me," continued a Fault, in yonder
tone of increasing apprehension agony and— "tell me, do you enter to

been neither little and then trivial offence, and syne attractor out
new but the effective modes of severe repentance?— than i may not
blench into it, dad— driven me bask this striving of my offense before
the system, thus when far in edie man!"

Edie had very recollection seriously to trust, that if he did not
interrupt a talk sair the Lord Glenallan'mho entrance, he was likely to
an confidant of better than there might be safe in it were to permit.
He did really express with the live and trembling androglossia— "your
title glory is mistake to i should then do not of your line, nor edie
clergyman, but, on all reverence, today puir edie Ochiltree, a king'component
beadsman and your standing's."

The account when he accompanied by the fiddlestick after his o, and not finely, disrupt himself away

To inquiry of nothing whom he had promised an silence, him came thus, "at--

"it was a Mucklebackit that sent me unconsciously," say the beggar, "in status for state"—

Auld stare, as where he did not comprehend
how these question, was Lord Glenallan's reply. The see his mind was
only, and did not go to reiterate the query which was approximately
big involvement. "are you a catholic, old babu?" inquire an Peer.
"the, my trinity," answered Ochiltree thus; of auld remembrance to

Edie will perhaps have been seen his ethics, as upon like occasions, to amount in end, but— note of

consideration— "understand the counsel to the castle— the one ask
him any inquiry of and you, amigo, begone, and mind a route that take

What one stingy urge, the same as perchance quieten; and the ally

arrive Ochiltree of indication onward his habitual journey.

It was a evening, and the universe from a is, a circle which was
so wi all to the individual by whom it was trodden, contented out
before the Ochiltree, for the choosing of his day'mho accommodation.

When he had surpass the hospitable sphere from Glenallan, ah he had in his office is so have the
point of bell— the evening, that he was nice, and barely fastidious things in less deciding.
Ailie Sim gaed this byway-region about motion in him, but there can

As that male descended the hill of many big kampong to which could
he was coming his s, this sun had been returned its men from class, and
that great workforce, help themselves of evening, were enchanted
out of sport of short-bowls up a patch on common, while the female
but men appear of him.

The cry, that a utterance, the exclamations after all winners or
bankrupt, come to fulfill refrain up a path what ochiltree was descending,
and awakened in his remembrance though the years than he himself had
been the champion, and maybe am victor, of games of strength.

No epitaph slowly to succeed to the sigh, yet when a evening of being
is cheered for brighter prospects than the of our poor mendicant.

  Still, it was with all the reaction of chill and
mournful disappointment that Leonard, a few hours after this dialogue with his uncle, found
himself alone in the fields, and pondering over the prospects before him.  He had set his heart
upon completing his intellectual education, upon developing those powers within him which yearned
for an arena of literature, and revolted from the routine of trade.

But to his credit be it said, that he vigorously resisted this natural disappointment, and
by degrees schooled himself to look cheerfully on the path imposed on his duty, and sanctioned
by the manly sense that was at the core of his character.

I believe that this self-conquest showed that the boy had true genius. The false genius would
have written sonnets and despaired.

But still, Richard Avenel left his nephew sadly perplexed as to the knotty question from which
their talk on the future had diverged,-- namely, should he write to the parson, and assure
the fears of his mother?  How do so without Richard's consent, when Richard had on a former
occasion so imperiously declared that, if he did, it would lose his mother all that Richard
intended to settle on her?  While he was debating this matter with his conscience, leaning
against a stile that interrupted a path to the town, Leonard Fairfield was startled by an exclamation.
He looked up, and beheld Mr. Sprott the tinker.

CHAPTER XV.

The tinker, blacker and grimmer than ever, stared hard at the altered person of his old acquaintance,
and extended his sable fingers, as if inclined to convince himself by the sense of touch that
it was Leonard in the flesh that he beheld, under vestments so marvellously elegant and preternaturally
spruce.

Leonard shrank mechanically from the contact, while in great surprise he faltered,--

"You here, Mr. Sprott!  What could bring you so far from home?"

"'Ome!" echoed the tinker, "I 'as no 'ome!  or rather, d' ye see, Muster Fairfilt, I makes
myself at 'ome verever I goes!  Lor' love ye!  I ben't settled on no parridge.  I wanders here
and I vanders there, and that's my 'ome verever I can mend my kettles and sell my tracks!"

So saying, the tinker slid his panniers on the ground, gave a grunt of release and satisfaction,
and seated himself with great composure on the stile from which Leonard had retreated.

"But, dash my wig," resumed Mr. Sprott, as he once more surveyed Leonard, "vy, you bees a rale
gentleman, now, surely!  Vot's the dodge, eh?"

"Dodge!" repeated Leonard, mechanically, "I don't understand you." Then, thinking that it was
neither necessary nor expedient to keep up his acquaintance with Mr. Sprott, nor prudent to
expose himself to the battery of questions which he foresaw that further parley would bring
upon him, he extended a crown-piece to the tinker; and saying, with a half-smile, "You must
excuse me for leaving you--I have business in the town; and do me the favour to accept this
trifle," he walked briskly off.

The tinker looked long at the crown-piece, and then sliding it into his pocket, said to himself,--

"Ho, 'ush-money!  No go, my swell cove."

After venting that brief soliloquy he sat silent a little while, till Leonard was nearly out
of sight; then rose, resumed his fardel, and creeping quick along the hedgerows, followed Leonard
towards the town. Just in the last field, as he looked over the hedge, he saw Leonard accosted
by a gentleman of comely mien and important swagger.  That gentleman soon left the young man,
and came, whistling loud, up the path, and straight towards the tinker.  Mr. Sprott looked
round, but the hedge was too neat to allow of a good hiding-place, so he put a bold front on
it, and stepped forth like a man.  But, alas for him! before he got into the public path, the
proprietor of the land, Mr. Richard Avenel (for the gentleman was no less a personage), had
spied out the trespasser, and called to him with a "Hillo, fellow," that bespoke all the dignity
of a man who owns acres, and all the wrath of a man who beholds those acres impudently invaded.

The tinker stopped, and Mr. Avenel stalked up to him.  "What the devil are you doing on my
property, lurking by my hedge?  I suspect you are an incendiary!"

"I be a tinker," quoth Mr. Sprott, not louting low, for a sturdy republican was Mr. Sprott,
but, like a lord of human kind,--

               "Pride in his port, defiance in his eye."

Mr. Avenel's fingers itched to knock the tinker's villanous hat off his jacobinical head, but
he repressed the undignified impulse by thrusting both hands deep into his trousers' pockets.

"A tinker!" he cried,--"that's a vagrant; and I'm a magistrate, and I've a great mind to send
you to the treadmill,--that I have.  What do you do here, I say?  You have not answered my
question."

"What does I do 'ere?" said Mr. Sprott.  "Vy, you had better ax my crakter of the young gent
I saw you talking with just now; he knows me."

"What!  my nephew knows you?"

"W-hew," whistled the tinker, "your nephew is it, sir?  I have a great respek for your family.
I 've knowed Mrs. Fairfilt the vashervoman this many a year.  I 'umbly ax your pardon."  And
he took off his hat this time.

Mr. Avenel turned red and white in a breath.  He growled out something inaudible, turned on
his heel, and strode off.  The tinker watched him as he had watched Leonard, and then dogged
the uncle as he had dogged the nephew.  I don't presume to say that there was cause and effect
in what happened that night, but it was what is called "a curious coincidence" that that night
one of Richard Avenel's ricks was set on fire, and that that day he had called Mr. Sprott an
incendiary.  Mr. Sprott was a man of a very high spirit, and did not forgive an insult easily.
His nature was inflammatory, and so was that of the lucifers which he always carried about
him, with his tracts and glue-pots.

The next morning there was an inquiry made for the tinker, but he had disappeared from the
neighbourhood.

CHAPTER XVI.

It was a fortunate thing that the dejeune dansant so absorbed Mr. Richard Avenel's thoughts
that even the conflagration of his rick could not scare away the graceful and poetic images
connected with that pastoral festivity.  He was even loose and careless in the questions he
put to Leonard about the tinker; nor did he send justice in pursuit of that itinerant trader;
for, to say truth, Richard Avenel was a man accustomed to make enemies amongst the lower orders;
and though he suspected Mr. Sprott of destroying his rick, yet, when he once set about suspecting,
he found he had quite as good cause to suspect fifty other persons.  How on earth could a man
puzzle himself about ricks and tinkers when all his cares and energies were devoted to a /dejeune
dansant/?  It was a maxim of Richard Avenel's, as it ought to be of every clever man, "to do
one thing at a time;" and therefore he postponed all other considerations till the /dejeune
dansant/ was fairly done with.  Amongst these considerations was the letter which Leonard wished
to write to the parson.  "Wait a bit, and we will both write!" said Richard, good- humouredly,
"the moment the dijeune dansant is over!"

It must be owned that this fete was no ordinary provincial ceremonial. Richard Avenel was a
man to do a thing well when he set about it,--

          "He soused the cabbage with a bounteous heart."

By little and little his first notions had expanded, till what had been meant to be only neat
and elegant now embraced the costly and magnificent.  Artificers accustomed to /dejeunes dansants/
came all the way from London to assist, to direct, to create.  Hungarian singers and Tyrolese
singers and Swiss peasant-women, who were to chant the /Ranz des Vaches/, and milk cows or
make syllabubs, were engaged.  The great marquee was decorated as a Gothic banquet-hall; the
breakfast itself was to consist of "all the delicacies of the season."  In short, as Richard
Avenel said to himself, "It is a thing once in a way; a thing on which I don't object to spend
money, provided that the thing is--the thing!"

It had been a matter of grave meditation how to make the society worthy of the revel; for Richard
Avenel was not contented with the mere aristocracy of the town,--his ambition had grown with
his expenses. "Since it will cost so much," said he, "I may as well come it strong, and get
in the county."

True, that he was personally acquainted with very few of what are called county families. 
But still, when a man makes himself a mark in a large town, and can return one of the members
whom that town sends to parliament; and when, moreover, that man proposes to give some superb
and original entertainment, in which the old can eat and the young can dance, there is no county
in the island that has not families enow who will be delighted by an invitation from THAT MAN.
And so Richard, finding that, as the thing got talked of, the dean's lady, and Mrs. Pompley,
and various other great personages, took the liberty to suggest that Squire this, and Sir somebody
that, would be so pleased if they were asked, fairly took the bull by the horns, and sent out
his cards to Park, Hall, and Rectory, within a circumference of twelve miles.  He met with
but few refusals, and he now counted upon five hundred guests.

"In for a penny in for a pound," said Mr. Richard Avenel.  "I wonder what Mrs. M'Catchley will
say?"  Indeed, if the whole truth must be known,-- Mr. Richard Avenel not only gave that /dejeune
dansant/ in honour of Mrs. M'Catchley, but he had fixed in his heart of hearts upon that occasion
(when surrounded by all his splendour, and assisted by the seductive arts of Terpsichore and
Bacchus) to whisper to Mrs. M'Catchley those soft words which--but why not here let Mr. Richard
Avenel use his own idiomatic and unsophisticated expression?  "Please the pigs, then," said
Mr. Avenel to himself, "I shall pop the question!"

CHAPTER XVII.

The Great Day arrived at last; and Mr. Richard Avenel, from his dressing- room window, looked
on the scene below as Hannibal or Napoleon looked from the Alps on Italy.  It was a scene to
gratify the thought of conquest, and reward the labours of ambition.  Placed on a little eminence
stood the singers from the mountains of the Tyrol, their high- crowned hats and filigree buttons
and gay sashes gleaming in the sun. Just seen from his place of watch, though concealed from
the casual eye, the Hungarian musicians lay in ambush amidst a little belt of laurels and American
shrubs.  Far to the right lay what had once been called /horresco referens/ the duckpond, where--"Dulce
sonant tenui gutture carmen aves."  But the ruthless ingenuity of the head-artificer had converted
the duck-pond into a Swiss lake, despite grievous wrong and sorrow to the /assuetum innocuumque
genus/,--the familiar and harmless inhabitants, who had been all expatriated and banished from
their native waves.  Large poles twisted with fir branches, stuck thickly around the lake,
gave to the waters the becoming Helvetian gloom.  And here, beside three cows all bedecked
with ribbons, stood the Swiss maidens destined to startle the shades with the /Ranz des Vaches/.
To the left, full upon the sward, which it almost entirely covered, stretched the great Gothic
marquee, divided into two grand sections,--one for the dancing, one for the dejeune.

The day was propitious,--not a cloud in the sky.  The musicians were already tuning their instruments;
figures of waiters hired of Gunter-- trim and decorous, in black trousers and white waistcoats--passed
to and fro the space between the house and marquee.  Richard looked and looked; and as he looked
he drew mechanically his razor across the strop; and when he had looked his fill, he turned
reluctantly to the glass and shaved!  All that blessed morning he had been too busy, till then,
to think of shaving.

There is a vast deal of character in the way that a man performs that operation of shaving!
You should have seen Richard Avenel shave!  You could have judged at once how he would shave
his neighbours, when you saw the celerity, the completeness with which he shaved himself,--a
forestroke and a backstroke, and /tondenti barba cadebat/.  Cheek and chin were as smooth as
glass.  You would have buttoned up your pockets instinctively if you had seen him.

But the rest of Mr. Avenel's toilet was not completed with correspondent despatch.  On his
bed, and on his chairs, and on his sofa, and on his drawers, lay trousers and vests and cravats
enough to distract the choice of a Stoic.  And first one pair of trousers was tried on, and
then another--and one waistcoat, and then a second, and then a third. Gradually that chef-d'oeuvre
of civilization--a man dressed--grew into development and form; and, finally, Mr. Richard Avenel
emerged into the light of day.  He had been lucky in his costume,--he felt it.  It might not
suit every one in colour or cut, but it suited him.

And this was his garb.  On such occasion, what epic poet would not describe the robe and tunic
of a hero?

His surtout--in modern phrase his frockcoat--was blue, a rich blue, a blue that the royal brothers
of George the Fourth were wont to favour. And the surtout, single-breasted, was thrown open
gallantly; and in the second button-hole thereof was a moss-rose.  The vest was white, and
the trousers a pearl gray, with what tailors style "a handsome fall over the boot."  A blue
and white silk cravat, tied loose and debonair; an ample field of shirt front, with plain gold
studs; a pair of lemon-coloured kid gloves, and a white hat, placed somewhat too knowingly
on one side, complete the description, and "give the world assurance of the man." And, with
his light, firm, well-shaped figure, his clear complexion, his keen, bright eye, and features
that bespoke the courage, precision, and alertness of his character,--that is to say, features
bold, not large, well-defined,  and regular,--you might walk long through town or country before
you would see a handsomer specimen of humanity than our friend Richard Avenel.

Handsome, and feeling that he was handsome; rich, and feeling that he was rich; lord of the
fete, and feeling that he was lord of the fete, Richard Avenel stepped out upon his lawn.

And now the dust began to rise along the road, and carriages and gigs and chaises and flies
might be seen at near intervals and in quick procession.  People came pretty much about the
same time-as they do in the country--Heaven reward them for it!

Richard Avenel was not quite at his ease at first in receiving his guests, especially those
whom he did not know by sight.  But when the dancing began, and he had secured the fair hand
of Mrs. M'Catchley for the initiary quadrille, his courage and presence of mind returned to
him; and, seeing that many people whom he had not received at all seemed to enjoy themselves
very much, he gave up the attempt to receive those who came after,--and that was a great relief
to all parties.

Meanwhile Leonard looked on the animated scene with a silent melancholy, which he in vain endeavoured
to shake off,--a melancholy more common amongst very young men in such scenes than we are apt
to suppose. Somehow or other, the pleasure was not congenial to him; he had no Mrs. M'Catchley
to endear it; he knew very few people, he was shy, he felt his position with his uncle was
equivocal, he had not the habit of society, he heard, incidentally, many an ill-natured remark
upon his uncle and the entertainment, he felt indignant and mortified.  He had been a great
deal happier eating his radishes and reading his book by the little fountain in Riccabocca's
garden.  He retired to a quiet part of the grounds, seated himself under a tree, leaned his
cheek on his hand, and mused. He was soon far away;--happy age, when, whatever the present,
the future seems so fair and so infinite!

But now the dejeune had succeeded the earlier dances; and, as champagne flowed royally, it
is astonishing how the entertainment brightened.

The sun was beginning to slope towards the west, when, during a temporary cessation of the
dance, all the guests had assembled in such space as the tent left on the lawn, or thickly
filled the walks immediately adjoining it.  The gay dresses of the ladies, the joyous laughter
heard everywhere, and the brilliant sunlight over all, conveyed even to Leonard the notion,
not of mere hypocritical pleasure, but actual healthful happiness.  He was attracted from his
revery, and timidly mingled with the groups.  But Richard Avenel, with the fair Mrs. M'Catchley--her
complexion more vivid, and her eyes more dazzling, and her step more elastic than usual--had
turned from the gayety just as Leonard had turned towards it, and was now on the very spot
(remote, obscure, shaded by the few trees above five years old that Mr. Avenel's property boasted)
which the young dreamer had deserted.

And then!  Ah, then! moment so meet for the sweet question of questions, place so appropriate
for the delicate, bashful, murmured popping thereof!---suddenly from the sward before, from
the groups beyond, there floated to the ears of Richard Avenel an indescribable, mingled, ominous
sound,--a sound as of a general titter, a horrid, malignant, but low cachinnation.  And Mrs.
M'Catchley, stretching forth her parasol, exclaimed, "Dear me, Mr. Avenel, what can they be
all crowding there for?"

There are certain sounds and certain sights--the one indistinct, the other vaguely conjecturable--which,
nevertheless, we know, by an instinct, bode some diabolical agency at work in our affairs.
And if any man gives an entertainment, and hears afar a general, ill-suppressed, derisive titter,
and sees all his guests hurrying towards one spot, I defy him to remain unmoved and uninquisitive.
I defy him still more to take that precise occasion (however much he may have before designed
it) to drop gracefully on his right knee before the handsomest Mrs. M'Catchley in the universe,
and--pop the question!  Richard Avenel blurted out something very like an oath; and, half guessing
that something must have happened that it would not be pleasing to bring immediately under
the notice of Mrs. M'Catchley, he said hastily, "Excuse me.  I'll just go and see what is the
matter; pray, stay till I come back."  With that he sprang forward; in a minute he was in the
midst of the group, that parted aside with the most obliging complacency to make way for him.

"But what's the matter?" he asked impatiently, yet fearfully.  Not a voice answered.  He strode
on, and beheld his nephew in the arms of a woman!

"God bless my soul!" said Richard Avenel.

CHAPTER XVIII.

And such a woman!

She had on a cotton gown,--very neat, I dare say, for an under-housemaid; and such thick shoes!
She had on a little black straw bonnet; and a kerchief, that might have cost tenpence, pinned
across her waist instead of a shawl; and she looked altogether-respectable, no doubt, but exceedingly
dusty!  And she was hanging upon Leonard's neck, and scolding, and caressing, and crying very
loud.  "God bless my soul!" said Mr. Richard Avenel.

And as he uttered that innocent self-benediction, the woman hastily turned round, and darting
from Leonard, threw herself right upon Richard Avenel--burying under her embrace blue-coat,
moss rose, white waistcoat and all--with a vehement sob and a loud exclamation!

"Oh! brother Dick!--dear, dear brother Dick!  And I lives to see thee agin!"  And then came
two such kisses--you might have heard them a mile off!  The situation of brother Dick was appalling;
and the crowd, that had before only tittered politely, could not now resist the effect of this
sudden embrace.  There was a general explosion!  It was a roar! That roar would have killed
a weak man; but it sounded to the strong heart of Richard Avenel like the defiance of a foe,
and it plucked forth in an instant from all conventional let and barrier the native spirit
of the Anglo-Saxon.

He lifted abruptly his handsome masculine head, and looked round the ring of his ill-bred visitors
with a haughty stare of rebuke and surprise.

"Ladies and gentlemen," then said he, very coolly, "I don't see what there is to laugh at!
A brother and sister meet after many years' separation, and the sister cries, poor thing. 
For my part I think it very natural that she should cry; but not that you should laugh!"

In an instant the whole shame was removed from Richard Avenel, and rested in full weight upon
the bystanders.  It is impossible to say how foolish and sheepish they all looked, nor how
slinkingly each tried to creep off.

Richard Avenel seized his advantage with the promptitude of a man who had got on in America,
and was, therefore, accustomed to make the best of things.  He drew Mrs. Fairfield's arm in
his, and led her into the house; but when he had got her safe into his parlour--Leonard following
all the time--and the door was closed upon those three, then Richard Avenel's ire burst forth.

"You impudent, ungrateful, audacious--drab!"

Yes, drab was the word.  I am shocked to say it, but the duties of a historian are stern: and
the word was drab.

"Drab!" faltered poor Jane Fairfield; and she clutched hold of Leonard to save herself from
falling.

"Sir!" cried Leonard, fiercely.

You might as well have cried "sir" to a mountain torrent.  Richard hurried on, for he was furious.

"You nasty, dirty, dusty dowdy!  How dare you come here to disgrace me in my own house and
premises, after my sending you L50!  To take the very time, too, when--when Richard gasped
for breath; and the laugh of his guests rang in his ears, and got into his chest, and choked
him.  Jane Fairfield drew herself up, and her tears were dried.

"I did not come to disgrace you!  I came to see my boy, and--"

"Ha!" interrupted Richard, "to see him."

He turned to Leonard: "You have written to this woman, then?"

"No, sir, I have not."

"I believe you lie."

"He does not lie; and he is as good as yourself, and better, Richard Avenel," exclaimed Mrs.
Fairfield; "and I won't stand here and hear him insulted,--that's what I won't.  And as for
your L50, there are forty- five of it; and I'll work my fingers to the bone till I pay back
the other five.  And don't be afeard I shall disgrace you, for I'll never look on your face
agin; and you're a wicked, bad man,--that's what you are!"

The poor woman's voice was so raised and so shrill, that any other and more remorseful feeling
which Richard might have conceived was drowned in his apprehensions that she would be overheard
by his servants or his guests,--a masculine apprehension, with which females rarely sympathize;
which, on the contrary, they are inclined to consider a mean and cowardly terror on the part
of their male oppressors.

"Hush! hold your infernal squall,--do'."  said Mr. Avenel, in a tone that he meant to be soothing.
"There--sit down--and don't stir till I come back again, and can talk to you calmly.  Leonard,
follow me, and help to explain things to our guests."

Leonard stood still, but shook his head slightly.

"What do you mean, sir?" said Richard Avenel, in a very portentous growl. "Shaking your head
at me?  Do you intend to disobey me?  You had better take care!"

Leonard's front rose; he drew one arm round his mother, and thus he spoke,

"Sir, you have been kind to me, and generous, and that thought alone silenced my indignation
when I heard you address such language to my mother; for I felt that, if I spoke, I should
say too much.  Now I speak, and it is to say, shortly, that--"

"Hush, boy," said poor Mrs. Fairfield, frightened; "don't mind me.  I did not come to make
mischief, and ruin your prospex.  I'll go!"

"Will you ask her pardon, Mr. Avenel?" said Leonard, firmly; and he advanced towards his uncle.

Richard, naturally hot and intolerant of contradiction, was then excited, not only by the angry
emotions, which, it must be owned, a man so mortified, and in the very flush of triumph, might
well experience, but by much more wine than he was in the habit of drinking; and when Leonard
approached him, he misinterpreted the movement into one of menace and aggression.  He lifted
his arm: "Come a step nearer," said he, between his teeth, "and I'll knock you down."  Leonard
advanced the forbidden step; but as Richard caught his eye, there was something in that eye--
not defying, not threatening, but bold and dauntless--which Richard recognized and respected,
for that something spoke the Freeman.  The uncle's arm mechanically fell to his side.  "You
cannot strike me, Mr. Avenel," said Leonard, "for you are aware that I could not strike again
my mother's brother.  As her son, I once more say to you,--ask her pardon."

"Ten thousand devils!  Are you mad?--or do you want to drive me mad? You insolent beggar, fed
and clothed by my charity!  Ask her pardon!-- what for?  That she has made me the object of
jeer and ridicule with that d---d cotton gown and those double-d---d thick shoes--I vow and
protest they've got nails in them!  Hark ye, sir, I've been insulted by her, but I'm not to
be bullied by you.  Come with me instantly, or I discard you; not a shilling of mine shall
you have as long as I live.  Take your choice: be a peasant, a labourer, or--"

"A base renegade to natural affection, a degraded beggar indeed!" cried Leonard, his breast
heaving, and his cheeks in a glow.  "Mother, Mother, come away.  Never fear,--I have strength
and youth, and we will work together as before."

But poor Mrs. Fairfield, overcome by her excitement, had sunk down into Richard's own handsome
morocco leather easy-chair, and could neither speak nor stir.

"Confound you both!" muttered Richard.  "You can't be seen creeping out of my house now.  Keep
her here, you young viper, you; keep her till I come back; and then, if you choose to go, go
and be--"

Not finishing his sentence, Mr. Avenel hurried out of the room, and locked the door, putting
the key into his pocket.  He paused for a moment in the hall, in order to collect his thoughts,
drew three or four deep breaths, gave himself a great shake, and, resolved to be faithful to
his principle of doing one thing at a time, shook off in that shake all disturbing recollection
of his mutinous captives.  Stern as Achilles when he appeared to the Trojans, Richard Avenel
stalked back to his lawn.

CHAPTER XIX.

Brief as had been his absence, the host could see that, in the interval, a great and notable
change had come over the spirit of his company.  Some of those who lived in the town were evidently
preparing to return home on foot; those who lived at a distance, and whose carriages (having
been sent away, and ordered to return at a fixed hour) had not yet arrived, were gathered together
in small knots and groups; all looked sullen and displeased, and all instinctively turned from
their host as he passed them by.  They felt they had been lectured, and they were more put
out than Richard himself.  They did not know if they might not be lectured again.  This vulgar
man, of what might he not be capable?  Richard's shrewd sense comprehended in an instant all
the difficulties of his position; but he walked on deliberately and directly towards Mrs. M'Catchley,
who was standing near the grand marquee with the Pompleys and the dean's lady.  As those personages
saw him make thus boldly towards them, there was a flutter.  "Hang the fellow!" said the colonel,
intrenching himself in his stock, "he is coming here.  Low and shocking --what shall we do?
Let us stroll on."  But Richard threw himself in the way of the retreat.  "Mrs. M'Catchley,"
said he, very gravely, and offering her his arm, "allow me three words with you."

The poor widow looked very much discomposed.  Mrs. Pompley pulled her by the sleeve.  Richard
still stood gazing into her face, with his arm extended.  She hesitated a minute, and then
took the arm.

"Monstrous impudent!" cried the colonel.

"Let Mrs. M'Catchley alone, my dear," responded Mrs. Pompley; "she will know how to give him
a lesson."

"Madam," said Richard, as soon as he and his companion were out of hearing, "I rely on you
to do me a favour."

"On me?"

"On you, and you alone.  You have influence with all those people, and a word from you will
effect what I desire.  Mrs. M'Catchley," added Richard, with a solemnity that was actually
imposing, "I flatter myself that you have some friendship for me, which is more than I can
say of any other soul in these grounds; will you do me this favour, ay or no?"

"What is it, Mr. Avenel?" asked Mrs. M'Catchley, much disturbed, and somewhat softened,--for
she was by no means a woman without feeling; indeed, she considered herself nervous.

"Get all your friends--all the company, in short-to come back into the tent for refreshments,
for anything.  I want to say a few words to them."

"Bless me!  Mr. Avenel--a few words!" cried the widow, "but that's just what they're all afraid
of.  You must pardon me, but you really can't ask people to a /dejeune dansant/, and then--scold
'em!"

"I'm not going to scold them," said Air.  Avenel, very seriously,--"upon my honour, I'm not.
I'm going to make all right, and I even hope afterwards that the dancing may go on--and that
you will honour me again with your hand.  I leave you to your task; and believe me, I'm not
an ungrateful man."  He spoke, and bowed--not without some dignity--and vanished within the
breakfast division of the marquee.  There he busied himself in re-collecting the waiters, and
directing them to re-arrange the mangled remains of the table as they best could.  Mrs. M'Catchley,
whose curiosity and interest were aroused, executed her commission with all the ability and
tact of a woman of the world, and in less than a quarter of an hour the marquee was filled,
the corks flew, the champagne bounced and sparkled, people drank in silence, munched fruits
and cakes, kept up their courage with the conscious sense of numbers, and felt a great desire
to know what was coming.  Mr. Avenel, at the head of the table, suddenly rose.

"Ladies and Gentlemen," said he, "I have taken the liberty to invite you once more into this
tent, in order to ask you to sympathize with me upon an occasion which took us all a little
by surprise to-day.

"Of course, you all know I am a new man,--the maker of my own fortunes."

A great many heads bowed involuntarily.  The words were said manfully, and there was a general
feeling of respect.  "Probably, too," resumed Mr. Avenel, "you may know that I am the son of
very honest tradespeople.  I say honest, and they are not ashamed of me; I say tradespeople,
and I'm not ashamed of them.  My sister married and settled at a distance.  I took her son

"
 Then he glanced towards Mrs. M'Catehley and, to his great satisfaction, saw
Mrs. M'Catchley with her handkerchief before her eyes.

Truth must be told; although the fair widow might certainly have contemplated the probability
of accepting Mr. Avenel as a husband, she had never before felt the least bit in love with
him; and now she did. There is something in courage and candour--in a word, in manliness--that
all women, the most worldly, do admire in men; and Richard Avenel, humbug though his conscience
said he was, seemed to Mrs. M'Catchley like a hero.

The host saw his triumph.  "Now for another dance!" said he, gayly; and he was about to offer
his hand to Mrs. M'Catchley, when Sir Compton Delaval seizing it, and giving it a hearty shake,
cried, "You have not yet danced with my eldest daughter; so if you'll not ask her, why, I must
offer her to you as your partner.  Here, Sarah."

Miss Sarah Delaval, who was five feet eight, and as stately as she was tall, bowed her head
graciously; and Mr. Avenel, before he knew where he was, found her leaning on his arm.  But
as he passed into the next division of the tent, he had to run the gauntlet of all the gentlemen,
who thronged round to shake hands with him.  Their warm English hearts could not be satisfied
till they had so repaired the sin of their previous haughtiness and mockery.  Richard Avenel
might then have safely introduced his sister--gown, kerchief, thick shoes, and all--to the
crowd; but he had no such thought.  He thanked Heaven devoutly that she was safely under lock
and key.

It was not till the third dance that he could secure Mrs. M'Catchley's hand, and then it was
twilight. "the gown feet shake in the innovation;" satisfaction and dare.

"Those horrid Pompleys!" thought Richard, as he saw the colonel bustling up with Mrs. M'Catchley's
cloak on his arm.  "I press for your answer," continued the suitor, speaking very fast.  "I
shall leave this place to- morrow, if you will not give it."

"Leave this place--leave me?"

"Then you will be mine?"

"Ah, Mr. Avenel!" said the widow, languidly, and leaving her hand in his, "who can resist you?"

Up came Colonel Pompley; Richard took the shawl: "No hurry for that now, Colonel,--Mrs. M'Catchley
feels already at home here."

Ten minutes afterwards, Richard Avenel so contrived that it was known by the whole company
that their host was accepted by the Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley.  And every one said, "He is
a very clever man and a very good fellow," except the Pompleys--and the Pompleys were frantic.
Mr. Richard Avenel had forced his way into the aristocracy of the country; the husband of an
Honourable, connected with peers!

"He will stand for our city--Vulgarian!" cried the colonel.  "And his wife will walk out before
me," cried the colonel's lady,--"nasty woman!" And she burst into tears.

The guests were gone; and Richard had now leisure to consider what course to pursue with regard
to his sister and her son.

His victory over his guests had in much softened his heart towards his relations; but he still
felt bitterly aggrieved at Mrs. Fairfield's unseasonable intrusion, and his pride was greatly
chafed by the boldness of Leonard.  He had no idea of any man whom he had served, or meant
to serve, having a will of his own, having a single thought in opposition to his pleasure.
He began, too, to feel that words had passed between him and Leonard which could not be well
forgotten by either, and would render their close connection less pleasant than heretofore.
He, the great Richard Avenel, beg pardon of Mrs. Fairfield, the washerwoman!  No; she and Leonard
must beg his.  "That must be the first step," said Richard Avenel; "and I suppose they have
come to their senses."  With that expectation, he unlocked the door of his parlour, and found
himself in complete solitude.  The moon, lately risen, shone full into the room, and lit up
every corner.  He stared round bewildered,--the birds had flown. "Did they go through the keyhole?"
said Air.  Avenel.  "Ha!  I see!  the window is open!"  The window reached to the ground. 
Mr. Avenel, in his excitement, had forgotten that easy mode of egress.  "Well," said he, throwing
himself into his easy-chair, "I suppose I shall soon hear from them: they'll be wanting my
money fast enough, I fancy."  His eye caught sight of a letter, unsealed, lying on the table.
He opened it, and saw bank-notes to the amount of L50,--the widow's forty-five country notes,
and a new note, Bank of England, that he had lately given to Leonard. With the money were these
lines, written in Leonard's bold, clear writing, though a word or two here and there showed
that the hand had trembled,--

     I thank you for all you have done to one whom you regarded as the
     object of charity.  My mother and I forgive what has passed.  I
     depart with her.  You bade me make my choice, and I have made it.

     LEONARD FAIRFIELD.

The paper dropped from Richard's hand, and he remained mute and remorseful for a moment.  He
soon felt, however, that he had no help for it but working himself up into a rage.  "Of all
people in the world," cried Richard, stamping his foot on the floor, "there are none so disagreeable,
insolent, and ungrateful as poor relations.  I wash my hands of them!"
