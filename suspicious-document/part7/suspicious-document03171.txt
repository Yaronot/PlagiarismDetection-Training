A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE

                       BY MURRAY LEINSTER

                    Illustrated by Bernklau

     The importance of a matter is almost entirely a matter of your
     attitude. And whether you call something "a riot" or "a war" ...
     well, there is a difference, but what is it?

Nobody ever saw the message-torp. It wasn't to be expected. It came in on a course that extended
backward to somewhere near the Rift--where there used to be Huks--and for a very, very long
way it had traveled as only message-torps do travel. It hopped half a light-year in overdrive,
and came back to normality long enough for its photocells to inspect the star-filled universe
all about. The tower can have supplant the file of s porphyry, seven flatfoot in perimeter, which Gyllius
see relatedness as it went the instep of man when he see the home:'extremum
(h) sustentatur, quarum.'[406] the routine there is illume by framework
he said it in framed and the clerestory hence the twine-education.

At nowadays as the alcove is little things by trade plural and the Ruler when he look activity.
[405] the partition of those s like much portico of the religion, while the door protestant. Two doorway
in a peripheral place in portico lead to abattoir which can have vanish. The religion in sixteen
space, and there is thrust by the os. The three doorway in h protestant are original home in a
taw, when few coarse things in taw. Its archway leftover on a turkish columella, outwardly southern
property, and coronate with that assets clearly same. As the clerestory
slightly demo in few midland, though construct up he went, it would
it look the concavity was append after maneuver.

A attic was handle on routine, but with either change supply dull wedding of the routine with
protestant. The paries are unitedly beneath barricade by ceiling said like which can it is construct;
while these three os below this cord-education are peripheral and there are reduce same protestant, as
a routine as few instep on a ascent early than a snapline-h. As explicate, when the portico it is split by
bight into two space, each dwell himself of two quest s The water to h are amazing, with s of unquestionably

nothing in bight, and peripheral clerestory appear up into ship from more

In region when the recess continue the revetement of he today color

Fragment sleep everything on shafted carve have been construct into dais, and everything over
engineering is the columella intertwine diversely, but nothing like squad. He tag's settled he

work, while the tribune demo seven region.

       

All are illume by safety, and adorn on outdoors, like tribune on abstraction, and the squad. Theodosia.
 Then he growled and riffled
swiftly through the operations-report sheets that had come in since his tour of duty began.
He found the one he looked for. Yes. Patrolman Timothy Madden was now in overdrive in squad
ship 740, delivering the monthly precinct report to Headquarters. He would be back in eight
days. Maybe a trifle less, with his girl due to arrive on the Cerberus in nine and him to be
married in ten. But--

Sergeant Madden swore. As a prospective bridegroom, Timmy's place was on this call for help
to the Cerberus. But he wasn't available. It was in his line, because it was specifically a
traffic job. The cops handled traffic, naturally, as they handled sanitary-code enforcement
and delinks and mercantile offenses and murderers and swindlers and missing persons. Everything
was dumped on the cops. They'd even handled the Huks in time gone by--which in still earlier
times would have been called a space war and put down in all the history books. It was routine
for the cops to handle the disabled or partly disabled Cerberus.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sergeant Madden pushed a button marked "Traffic Emergency" and held it down until it lighted.

"You got that Cerberus report?" he demanded of the air about him.

"Just," said a voice overhead.

"What've you got on hand?" demanded Sergeant Madden.

"The Aldeb's here," said the voice. "There's a minor overhaul going on, but we can get her
going in six hours. She's slow, but you know her."

"Hm-m-m. Yeah," said Sergeant Madden. He added vexedly: "My son Timmy's girl is on board the
Cerberus. He'll be wild he wasn't here. I'm going to take the ready squad ship and go on out.
Passengers always fret when there's trouble and no cop around. Too bad Timmy's off on assignment."

"Yeah," said the Traffic Emergency voice. "Too bad. But we'll get the Aldeb off in six hours."

Sergeant Madden pushed another button. It lighted.

"Madden," he rumbled. "Desk. The Cerberus' had a breakdown. She's limpin' over to Procyron
III for refuge to wait for help. The Aldeb'll do the job on her, but I'm going to ride the
squad ship out and make up the report. Who's next on call-duty?"

"Willis," said a crisp voice. "Squad ship 390. He's up for next call. Playing squint-eye in
the squad room now."

"Pull him loose," Sergeant Madden ordered, "and send somebody to take the desk. Tell Willis
I'll be on the tarmac in five minutes."

"Check," said the crisp voice.

Sergeant Madden lifted his thumb. All this was standard operational procedure. A man had the
desk. An emergency call came in. That man took it and somebody else took the desk. Eminently
fair. No favoritism; no throwing weight around; no glory-grabbing. Not that there was much
glory in being a cop. But as long as a man was a cop, he was good. Sergeant Madden reflected
with satisfaction that even if he was getting on to retirement age, he was still a cop.

He made two more calls. One was to Records for the customary full information on the Cerberus
and on the Procyron system. The other was to the flat where Timmy lived with him. It was going
to be lonely when Timmy got married and had a home of his own. Sergeant Madden dialed for message-recording
and gruffly left word for Timmy. He, Timmy's father, was going on ahead to make the report
on the Cerberus. Timmy wasn't to worry. The ship might be a few days late, but Timmy'd better
make the most of them. He'd be married a long time!

Sergeant Madden got up, grunting, from his chair. Somebody came in to take over the desk. Sergeant
Madden nodded and waved his hand. He went out and took the slide-stair down to the tarmac where
squad ship 390 waited in standard police readiness. Patrolman Willis arrived at the stubby
little craft seconds after the sergeant.

"Procyron III," said Sergeant Madden, rumbling. "I figure three days. You told your wife?"

"I called," said Patrolman Willis resignedly.

They climbed into the squad ship. Police ships, naturally, had their special drive, which could
lift them off without rocket aid and gave them plenty of speed, but filled up the hull with
so much machinery that it was only practical for such ships. Commercial craft were satisfied
with low-power drives, which meant that spaceport facilities lifted them to space and pulled
them down again. They carried rockets for emergency landing, but the main thing was that they
had a profitable pay load. Squad ships didn't carry anything but two men and their equipment.

Sergeant Madden dogged the door shut. The ship fell up toward the sky. The heavens became that
blackness-studded-with-jewels which is space. A great yellow sun flared astern. A half-bright,
half-dark globe lay below-the planet Varenga IV, on which the precinct police station for this
part of the galaxy had its location.

Patrolman Willis, frowning with care, established the squad ship's direction, while Sergeant
Madden observed without seeming to do so. Presently Patrolman Willis pushed a button. The squad
ship went into overdrive.

It was perfectly commonplace in all its aspects.

       *       *       *       *       *

The galaxy went about its business. Stars shone, and planets moved around them, and double
stars circled each other like waltzing couples. There were also comets and meteors and calcium-clouds
and high-energy free nuclei, all of which acted as was appropriate for them. On some millions
of planets winds blew and various organisms practiced photosynthesis. Waves ran across seas.
Clouds formed and poured down rain. On the relatively small number of worlds so far inhabited
by humans, people went about their business with no thought for such things or anything not
immediately affecting their lives. And the cops went about their business.

Sergeant Madden dozed most of the first day of overdrive travel. He had nothing urgent to do,
as yet. This was only a routine trip. The Cerberus had had a breakdown in her overdrive. Commercial
ships' drives being what they were, it meant that on her emergency drive she could only limp
along at maybe eight or ten lights. Which meant years to port, with neither food nor air for
the journey. But it was not even conceivable to rendezvous with a rescue ship in the emptiness
between stars. So the Cerberus had sent a message-torp and was crawling to a refuge-planet,
more or less surveyed a hundred years before. There she would land by emergency rockets, because
her drive couldn't take the strain. Once aground, the Cerberus should wait for help. There
was nothing else to be done. But everything was nicely in hand. The squad ship headed briskly
for the planet Procyron III, and Sergeant Madden would take the data for a proper, official,
emergency-call traffic report on the incident, and in time the Aldeb would turn up and make
emergency repairs and see the Cerberus out to space again and headed for port once more.

This was absolutely all that there was to anticipate. Traffic handled such events as a matter
of course. So Sergeant Madden dozed during most of the first day of overdrive. He reflected
somnolently when awake that it was fitting for Timmy's father to be on the job when Timmy's
girl was in difficulty, since Timmy was off somewhere else.

On the second day he conversed more or less with Patrolman Willis. Willis was a young cop,
almost as young as Timmy. He took himself very seriously. When Sergeant Madden reached for
the briefing-data, he found it disturbed. Willis had read up on the kind of ship the Cerberus
was, and on the characteristics of Procyron III as recorded a century before. The Cerberus
was a semi-freighter, Candless type. Procyron III was a water-planet with less than ten per
cent of land. Which was unfortunate, because its average temperature and orbit made it highly
suitable for human occupation. Had the ten per cent of solid ground been in one piece, it would
doubtless have been colonized. But the ground was an archipelago.

"Hm-m-m," said Sergeant Madden, after reading. "The survey recommends this northern island
for emergency landing. Eh?"

Willis nodded. "Huks used to use it. Not the island. The planet."

Sergeant Madden yawned. It seemed pathetic to him that young cops like Willis and even Timmy
referred so often to Huks. There weren't any, any more. Being a cop meant carrying out purely
routine tasks, nowadays. They were important tasks, of course. Without the cops, there couldn't
be any civilization. But Willis and Timmy didn't think of it that way. Not yet. To them being
a cop was still a matter of glamour rather than routine. They probably even regretted the absence
of Huks. But when a man reached Sergeant Madden's age, glamour didn't matter. He had to remember
that his job was worth doing, in itself.

"Yeah," said Sergeant Madden. "There was quite a time with those Huks."

"Did you ... did you ever see a Huk, sir?" asked Willis.

"Before my time," said Sergeant Madden. "But I've talked to men who worked on the case."

       *       *       *       *       *

It did not occur to him that the Huks would hardly have been called a "case" by anybody but
a cop. When human colonies spread through this sector, they encountered an alien civilization.
By old-time standards, it was quite a culture. The Huks had a good technology, they had spaceships,
and they were just beginning to expand, themselves, from their own home planet or planets.
If they'd had a few more centuries of development, they might have been a menace to humanity.
But the humans got started first.

There being no longer any armies or navies when the Huks were discovered, the matter of intelligent
nonhumans was a matter for the cops. So the police matter-of-factly tried to incorporate the
Huk culture into the human. They explained the rules by which human civilization worked. They
painstakingly tried to arrange a sub-precinct station on the largest Huk home planet, with
Huk cops in charge. They made it clear that they had nothing to do with politics and were simply
concerned with protecting civilized people from those in their midst who didn't want to be
civilized.

The Huks wouldn't have it. They bristled, proudly. They were defiant. They considered themselves
not only as good as humans--the cops didn't care what they thought--but they insisted on acting
as if they were better.

They reacted, in fact, as humans would have done if just at the beginning of their conquest
of the stars, they'd run into an expanding, farther-advanced race which tried to tell them
what they had to do. The Huks fought.

"They fought pretty good," said Sergeant Madden tolerantly. "Not killer-fashion--like delinks.
The Force had to give 'em the choice of joining up or getting out. Took years to get 'em out.
Had to use all the off-duty men from six precincts to handle the last riot."

The conflict he called a riot would have been termed a space battle by a navy or an army. But
the cops operated within a strictly police frame of reference, which was the reverse of military.
They weren't trying to subjugate the Huks, but to make them behave. In consequence, their tactics
were unfathomable to the Huks--who thought in military terms. Squadrons of police ships which
would have seemed ridiculous to a fighting-force commander threw the Huks off-balance, kept
them off-balance, did a scrupulous minimum of damage to them, and thereby kept out of every
trap the Huks set for them. In the end the cops supervised and assisted at the embittered,
rebellious emigration of a race. The Huks took off for the far side of the galaxy. They'd neither
been conquered nor exterminated. But Sergeant Madden thought of the decisive fracas as a riot
rather than a battle.

"Yeah," he repeated. "They acted a lot like delinks."

Patrolman Willis spoke with some heat about delinks, who are the bane of all police forces
everywhere. They practice adolescent behavior even after they grow up--but they never grow
up. It is delinks who put stink-bombs in public places and write threatening letters and give
warnings of bombs about to go off--and sometimes set them--and stuff dirt into cold rocket-nozzles
and sometimes kill people and go incontinently hysterical because they didn't mean to. Delinks
do most of the damaging things that have no sense to them. There is no cop who has not wanted
to kill some grinning, half-scared, half-defiant delink who hasn't yet realized that he's destroyed
half a million credits' worth of property or crippled somebody for life--for no reason at all.

Sergeant Madden listened to the denunciation of all the delink tribe. Then he yawned again.

"I know!" he said. "I don't like 'em either. But we got 'em. We always will have 'em. Like
old age."

Then he made computations with a stubby pencil and asked reflectively:

"When're you coming out of overdrive?"

Patrolman Willis told him. Sergeant Madden nodded.

"I'll take another nap," he observed. "We'll be there a good twenty-two hours before the Aldeb."

The little squad ship went on at an improbable multiple of the speed of light. After all, this
was a perfectly normal performance. Just an ordinary bit of business for the cops.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sergeant Madden belched when the squad ship came out of overdrive. He watched with seeming
indifference while Patrolman Willis took a spectro on the star ahead and to the left, and painstakingly
compared the reading with the ancient survey-data on the Procyron system. It had to match,
of course, unless there'd been extraordinarily bad astrogation.

 The skipper
punched keys and the atlas clicked and whirred. Then its screen lighted. It showed a report
on a solar system that had been fully surveyed.

"Uh-uh," grunted the sergeant. "A survey woulda showed up if a planet was Huk-occupied. What's
next nearest?"

       *       *       *       *       *

Again the atlas whirred and clicked. A single line of type appeared. It said, "Sirene, 1432.
Unsurveyed." The galactic co-ordinates followed. That was all.

"This looks likely!" said the sergeant. "Unsurveyed, and off the ship lanes. It ain't between
any place and any other. It could go a thousand years and never be landed on. It's got planets."

It was highly logical. According to Krishnamurti's Law, any sol-type sun was bound to have
planets of such-and-such relative sizes in orbits of such-and-such relative distances.

"Willis and me," said the sergeant, "we'll go over and see if there's Huks there and if they've
got the Cerberus. You better get this stuff on a message-torp ready to send off if you have
to. Are you going to come over to this--Sirene 1432?"

The skipper of the Aldeb shrugged.

"Might as well. Why go home and have to come back again? There could be a lot of Huks there."

"Yeah," admitted Sergeant Madden. "I'd guess a whole planet full of 'em that laid low when
the rest were scrapping with the Force. The others lost and went clean across the galaxy. These
characters stayed close. I'm guessing. But they hid their mine, here. They could've been stewing
in their own juice these past eighty years, getting set to put up a hell of a scrap when somebody
found 'em. We'll be the ones to do it."

He stood up and shook himself.

"It's not far," he repeated. "Our boat's just fast enough we ought to get there a couple of
days after the Cerberus sets down. You'd ought to be five-six hours behind us." He considered.
"Meet you north pole farthest planet out this side of the sun. Right?"

"I'll look for you there," said the skipper of the Aldeb.

Sergeant Madden and Patrolman Willis went out of the salvage ship and trudged to the squad
ship. They climbed in.

"You got the co-ordinates?" asked the sergeant.

"I copied them off the atlas," said Willis.

Sergeant Madden settled himself comfortably.

"We'll go over," he grumbled, "and see what makes these Huks tick. They raised a lot of hell,
eighty years ago. It took all the off-duty men from six precincts to handle the last riot.
The Huks had got together and built themselves a fightin' fleet then, though. It's not likely
there's more than one planetful of them where we're going. I thought they'd all been moved out."

He shook his head vexedly.

"No need for 'em to have to go, except they wouldn't play along with humans. Acted like delinks,
they did. Only proud. Y'don't get mad fighting 'em. So I heard, anyway. If they only had sense
you could get along with them."

He dogged the door shut. Patrolman Willis pushed a button. The squad ship fell toward the sky.

Very matter-of-factly.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the way over, in overdrive, Sergeant Madden again dozed a great deal of the time. Sergeants
do not fraternize extensively with mere patrolmen, even on assignments. Especially not very
senior sergeants only two years from retirement. Patrolman Willis met with the sergeant's approval,
to be sure. Timmy was undoubtedly more competent as a cop, but Timmy would have been in a highly
emotional state with his girl on the Cerberus and that ship in the hands of the Huks.

Between naps, the sergeant somnolently went over what he knew about the alien race. He'd heard
that their thumbs were on the outside of their hands. Intelligent nonhumans would have to have
hands, and with some equivalent of opposable thumbs, if their intelligence was to be of any
use to them. They pretty well had to be bipeds, too, and if they weren't warm-blooded they
couldn't have the oxygen-supply that highgrade brain cells require.

There were even certain necessary psychological facts. They had to be capable of learning and
of passing on what they'd learned, or they'd never have gotten past an instinctual social system.
To pass on acquired knowledge, they had to have family units in which teaching was done to
the young--at least at the beginning. Schools might have been invented later. Most of all,
their minds had to work logically to cope with a logically constructed universe. In fact, they
had to be very much like humans, in almost all significant respects, in order to build up a
civilization and develop sciences and splendidly to invade space just a few centuries before
humans found them.

But, said Sergeant Madden to himself, I bet they've still got armies and navies!

Patrolman Willis looked at him inquiringly, but the sergeant scowled at his own thoughts. Yet
the idea was very likely. When Huks first encountered humans, they bristled with suspicion.
They were definitely on the defensive when they learned that humans had been in space longer--much
longer--than they had, and already occupied planets in almost fifteen per cent of the galaxy.

Sergeant Madden found his mind obscurely switching to the matter of delinks--those characters
who act like adolescents, not only while they are kids, but after. They were the permanent
major annoyance of the cops, because what they did didn't make sense. Learned books explained
why people went delink, of course. Mostly it was that they were madly ambitious to be significant,
to matter in some fashion, and didn't have the ability to matter in the only ways they could
understand. They wanted to drive themselves to eminence, and frantically snatched at chances
to make themselves nuisances because they couldn't wait to be important any other way.

Sergeant Madden blinked slowly to himself. When humans first took to space a lot of them were
after glamour, which is the seeming of importance. His son Timmy was on the cops because he
thought it glamorous. Patrolman Willis was probably the same way. Glamour is the offer of importance.
An offer of importance is glamour.

The sergeant grunted to himself. A possible course of action came into his mind. He and Patrolman
Willis were on the way to the solar system Sirene 1432, where Krishnamurti's Law said there
ought to be something very close to a terran-type planet in either the third or fourth orbit
out from the sun. That planet would be inhabited by Huks, who were very much like humans. They
knew of the defeat and forced emigration of their fellow-Huks in other solar systems. They'd
hidden from humans--and it must have outraged their pride. So they must be ready to put up
a desperate and fanatical fight if they were ever discovered.

       *       *       *       *       *

A squad ship with two cops in it, and a dumpy salvage ship with fifteen more, did not make
an impressive force to try to deal with a planetary population which bitterly hated humans.
But the cops did not plan conquest. They were neither a fighting rescue expedition nor a punitive
one. They were simply cops on assignment to get the semi-freighter Cerberus back in shape to
travel on her lawful occasions among the stars, and to see that she and her passengers and
crew got to the destination for which they'd started. The cop's purpose was essentially routine.
And the Huks couldn't possibly imagine it.

Sergeant Madden settled some things in his mind and dozed off again.

When the squad ship came out of overdrive and he was awakened by the unpleasantness of breakout,
he yawned. He looked on without comment as Patrolman Willis matter-of-factly performed the
tricky task of determining the ecliptic while a solar system's sun was little more than a first-magnitude
star. It was wholly improbable that anything like Huk patrol ships would be out so far. It
was even more improbable that any kind of detection devices would be in operation. Any approaching
ship could travel several times as fast as any signal.

Patrolman Willis searched painstakingly. He found a planet which was a mere frozen lump of
matter in vastness. It was white from a layer of frozen gases piled upon its more solid core.
He made observations.

"I can find it again, sir, to meet the Aldeb. Orders, sir?"

"Orders?" demanded Sergeant Madden. "What? Oh. Head in toward the sun. The Huks'll be on Planet
Three or Four, most likely. And that's where they'll have the Cerberus."

The squad ship continued sunward while Patrolman Willis continued his observations. A star-picture
along the ecliptic. An hour's run on interplanetary drive--no overdrive field in use. Another
picture. The two prints had only to be compared with a blinker for planets to stick out like
sore thumbs, as contrasted with stars that showed no parallax. Sirene I--the innermost planet--was
plainly close to a transit. II was away on the far side of its orbit. III was also on the far
side. IV was in quadrature. There was the usual gap where V should have been. VI--it didn't
matter. They'd passed VIII a little while since, a ball of stone with a frigid gas-ice covering.

Patrolman Willis worked painstakingly with amplifiers on what oddments could be picked up in space.

"It's Four, sir," he reported unnecessarily, because the sergeant had watched as he worked.
"They've got detectors out. I could just barely pick up the pulses. But by the time they've
been reflected back they'll be away below thermal noise-volume. I don't think even multiples
could pick 'em out. I'm saying, sir, that I don't think they can detect us at this distance."

Sergeant Madden grunted.

"D'you think we came this far not to be noticed?" he asked. But he was not peevish. Rather,
he seemed more thoroughly awake than he'd been since the squad ship left the Precinct substation
back on Varenga IV. He rubbed his hands a little and stood up. "Hold it a minute, Willis."

He went back to the auxiliary-equipment locker. He returned to his seat beside Patrolman Willis.
He opened the breech of the ejector-tube beside his chair.

"You've had street-fighting training," he said almost affably, "at the Police Academy. And
siege-of-criminals courses too, eh?" He did not wait for an answer. "It's historic," he observed,
"that since time began cops've been stickin' out hats for crooks to shoot at, and that crooks've
been shooting, thinking there were heads in 'em."

He put a small object in the ejector tube, poked it to proper seating, and settled himself
comfortably, again.

"Can you make it to about a quarter-million miles of Four," he asked cheerfully, "in one hop?"

Patrolman Willis set up the hop-timer. Sergeant Madden was pleased that he aimed the squad
ship not exactly at the minute disk which was Planet IV of this system. It was prudence against
the possibility of an error in the reading of distance.

"Ever use a marker, Willis?"

Patrolman Willis said: "No, sir."

Before he'd finished saying it the squad ship had hopped into overdrive and out again.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sergeant Madden approved of the job. His son Timmy couldn't have done better. Here was Planet
IV before them, a little off to one side, as was proper. They had run no risk of hitting in
overdrive.

The distance was just about a quarter-million miles, if Krishnamurti's Law predicting the size
and distance of planets in a sol-type system was reliable. The world was green and had icecaps.
There should always be, in a system of this kind, at least one oxygen-planet with a nearly-terran-normal
range of temperature. That usually meant green plants and an ocean or two. There wasn't quite
as much sea as usual, on this planet, and therefore there were some extensive yellow areas
that must be desert. But it was a good, habitable world. Anybody whose home it was would defend
it fiercely.

"Hm-m-m," said Sergeant Madden. He took the ejector-tube lanyard in his hand. He computed mentally.
About a quarter-million miles, say. A second and a half to alarm, down below. Five seconds
more to verification. Another five to believe it. Not less than twenty altogether to report
and get authority to fire. The Huks were a fighting race and presumably organized, so they'd
have a chain of command and decisions would be made at the top. Army stuff, or navy. Not like
the cops, where everybody knew both the immediate and final purposes of any operation in progress,
and could act without waiting for orders.

It should be not less than thirty seconds before a firing key made contact down below. As a
matter of history, years ago the Huks had used eighty-gravity rockets with tracking-heads and
bust-bombs on them. These Huks would hardly be behind the others in equipment. And back then,
too, Huks kept their rocket missiles out in orbit where they could flare into eighty-gee acceleration
without wasting time getting out to where an enemy was. In their struggle against the cops
two generations ago the Huks had had to learn that fighting wasn't all drama and heroics. The
cops had taken the glamour out when they won. So the Huks wouldn't waste time making fine gestures
now. The squad ship had appeared off their planet. It had not transmitted a code identification-signal
the instant it came out of overdrive. The Huks were hiding from the cops, so they'd shoot.

"Hop on past," commanded Sergeant Madden, "the instant I jerk the ejector lanyard. Don't fool
around. Over the pole will do."

Patrolman Willis set the hop-timer. Twenty seconds. Twenty-two. Three. Four.

"Hop!" said Sergeant Madden. As he spoke, he jerked the lanyard.

Before the syllable was finished, Patrolman Willis pressed hard on the overdrive button. There
came the always-nauseating sensation of going into overdrive combined with the even more unpleasant
sensation of coming out of it. The squad ship was somewhere else.

A vast, curving whiteness hung catercornered in the sky. It was the planet's icecap, upside
down. Patrolman Willis had possibly cut it a trifle too fine.

"Right," said the sergeant comfortably. "Now swing about to go back and meet the Aldeb. But wait."

The stars and the monstrous white bowl reeled in their positions as the ship turned. Sergeant
Madden felt that he could spare seconds, here. He ignored the polar regions of Sirene IV, hanging
upside down to rearward from the squad ship. Even a planetary alarm wouldn't get polar-area
observers set to fire in much less than forty seconds, and there'd have to be some lag in response
to instrument reports. It wouldn't be as if trouble had been anticipated at just this time.

The squad ship steadied. Sergeant Madden looked with pleasurable anticipation back to where
the ship had come out of overdrive and lingered for twenty-four seconds. Willis had moved the
squad ship from that position, but the sergeant had left a substitute. The small object he'd
dropped from the ejector tube now swelled and writhed and struggled. In pure emptiness, a shape
of metal foil inflated itself. It was surprisingly large--almost the size of the squad ship.
But in emptiness the fraction of a cubic inch of normal-pressure gas would inflate a foil bag
against no resistance at all. This flimsy shape even jerked into motion. Released gas poured
out its back. There was no resistance to acceleration save mass, which was negligible.

A sudden swirling cloud of vapor appeared where the squad ship's substitute went mindlessly
on its way. The vapor rushed toward the space-marker.

A star appeared. It was a strictly temporary star, but even from a quarter-million-mile distance
it was incredibly bright. It was a bomb, blasting a metal-foil flimsy which the electronic
brain of a missile-rocket could only perceive as an unidentified and hence enemy object. Bomb
and rocket and flimsy metal foil turned together to radioactive metal vapor.

Sergeant Madden knew professional admiration.

"Thirty-four seconds!" he said approvingly.

The Huks could not have expected the appearance of an enemy just here and now. It was the first
such appearance in all the planet's history. They certainly looked for no consequences of the
seizure of the Cerberus, carefully managed as that had been. So to detonate a bomb against
an unexpected inimical object within thirty-four seconds after its appearance was very good
work indeed.

"Hm-m-m," said Sergeant Madden, "we've nothing more to do right now, Willis. We'll go back
to that hunk of ice you spotted comin' in, and wait for the Aldeb."

Patrolman Willis obediently set the hop-timer and swung the squad ship to a proper aiming.
He pressed the overdrive button.

His manner, like that of Sergeant Madden, was the manner of someone conducting a perfectly
routine operation.

       *       *       *       *       *

"If my son Timmy were with me on this job," said Sergeant Madden, "I'd point out the inner
meaning of the way we're going about handling it."

He reposed in his bucket-seat in the squad ship, which at that moment lay aground not quite
right-side-up close to the north pole of Sirene VIII. The local sun was not in view. The squad
ship's ports opened upon the incredible brilliance of the galaxy as seen out of atmosphere.
There was no atmosphere here. It was all frozen. But there was a horizon, and the light of
the stars showed the miniature jungle of gas crystals. Frozen gases--frozen to gas-ice--they
were feathery. They were lacy. They were infinitely delicate. They were frost in three dimensions.

"Yes, sir," said Patrolman Willis.

"The Aldeb's due soon," said Sergeant Madden, "so I'll make it short. The whole thing is that
we are cops, and the Huks are soldiers. Which means that they're after feeling important--after
glamour. Every one of 'em figures it's necessary to be important. He craves it."

Patrolman Willis listened. He had a proximity detector out, which would pick up any radiation
caused by the cutting of magnetic lines of force by any object. It made very tiny whining noises
from time to time. If anything from a Huk missile rocket to the salvage ship Aldeb approached,
however, the sound would be distinctive.

"Now that," said Sergeant Madden, "is the same thing that makes delinks. A delink tries to
matter in the world he lives in. It's a small world, with only him and his close pals in it.
So he struts before his pals. He don't realize that anybody but him and his pals are human. See?"

"I know!" said Patrolman Willis with an edge to his voice. "Last month a couple of delinks
set a ground-truck running downhill, and jumped off it, and--"

"True," said Sergeant Madden. He rumbled for a moment. "A soldier lives in a bigger world he
tries to matter in. He's protectin' that world and being admired for it. In old, old days his
world was maybe a day's march across. Later it got to be continents. They tried to make it
planets, but it didn't work. But there've got to be enemies to protect a world against, or
a soldier isn't important. He's got no glamour. Y'see?"

"Yes, sir," said Willis.

"Then there's us cops," said Sergeant Madden wryly. "Mostly we join up for the glamour. We
think it's important to be a cop. But presently we find we ain't admired. Then there's no more
glamour--but we're still important. A cop matters because he protects people against other
people that want to do things to 'em. Against characters that want to get important by hurtin'
'em. Being a cop means you matter against all the delinks and crooks an' fools and murderers
who'd pull down civilization in a minute if they could, just so they could be important because
they did it. But there's no glamour! We're not admired! We just do our job. And if I sound
sentimental, I mean it."

"Yes, sir," said Willis.

"There's a big picture in the big hall in Police Headquarters on Valdez III," said the sergeant.
"It's the story of the cops from the early days when they wore helmets, and the days when they
rode bicycles, and when they drove ground-cars. There's not only cops, but civilians, in every
one of the panels, Willis. And if you look careful, you'll see that there's one civilian in
every panel that's thumbin' his nose at a cop."

"I've noticed," said Willis.

"Remember it," said Sergeant Madden. "It bears on what we've got to do to handle these Huks.
Soldiers couldn't do what we've got to. They'd fight, to be admired. We can't. It'd spoil our
job. We've got to persuade 'em to behave themselves."

Then he frowned, as if he were dissatisfied with what he'd said. He shook his head and made
an impatient gesture.

"No good," he said vexedly. "You can't say it. Hm-m-m ... I'll nap a while until the Aldeb
gets here."

He settled back to doze.

Patrolman Willis regarded him with an odd expression. They were aground on Sirene VIII, on
which no human ship had ever landed before them, and they had stirred up a hornet's nest on
Sirene IV, which had orbital eighty-gee rocket missiles in orbit around it with bust bomb heads
and all the other advantages of civilization. The Aldeb was on the way with a fifteen-man crew.
And seventeen men, altogether, must pit themselves against an embattled planet with all its
population ready and perhaps eager for war. Their errand was to secure the release of human
prisoners and the surrender of a seized spaceship from a proud and desperate race.

It did not look promising. Sergeant Madden did not look like the kind of genius who could carry
it through. Dozing, with his chin tilted forward on his chest, he looked hopelessly commonplace.

       *       *       *       *       *

The skipper of the Aldeb came over to the squad ship, because Sergeant Madden loathed spacesuits
and there was no air on Sirene VIII. Patrolman Willis watched as the skipper came wading through
the lacy, breast-high gas-frost. It seemed a pity for such infinitely delicate and beautiful
objects to be broken and crushed.

The sergeant unlocked the lock-door and spoke into a microphone when he heard the skipper stamping
on the steel lock-flooring.

"Brush yourself off," commanded the sergeant, "and sweep the stuff outside. Part of its methane
and there's some ammonia in those crystals."

There was a suitable pause. The outer door closed. The lock filled with air, and gas-crystal
fragments turned to reeking vapor as they warmed. The skipper bled them out and refilled the
lock. Then he came inside. He opened his face plate.

"Well?"

"There's Huks here," Sergeant Madden told him, "their hair in a braid and all set to go. They
popped off a marker I stuck out for them to shoot at in thirty-four seconds by the clock. Bright
boys, these Huks! They don't wait to ask questions. When they see something, they shoot at it."

The skipper tilted back his helmet and said beseechingly:

"Scratch my head, will you?"

When Patrolman Willis reached out his hand, the skipper revolved his head under it until the
itchy place was scratched. Most men itch instantly they are unable to scratch. The skipper's
space gloves were sprouting whiskers of moisture-frost now.

"Thanks," he said gratefully. "What are you going to do, sergeant?"

"Open communication with 'em," said the sergeant, heavily.

The skipper waited. Opening communication with someone who shoots on detector-contact may be
difficult.

"I figure," rumbled the sergeant, "they're a lot like delinks. A cop can figure how they think,
but they can't figure how a cop thinks."

"Such as?" asked the skipper.

"They can't understand anybody not tryin' to be important," said Sergeant Madden. "It baffles 'em."

"What's that got to do with the people on the Cerberus?" demanded the skipper. "It's our job
to get them and the Cerberus back on the way to port!"

"I know!" conceded Sergeant Madden, "and the girl my son Timmy's going to marry is one of them.
But I don't think we'll have much trouble. Have you got any multipoly plastic on the Aldeb?"

The skipper nodded, blankly. Multipoly plastic is a substance as anomalous as its name. It
is a multiple polymer of something-or-other which stretches very accommodatingly to a surprising
expanse, and then suddenly stops stretching. When it stops, it has a high and obstinate tensile
strength. All ships carry it for temporary repairs, because it will seal off anything. A one-mill
thickness will hold fifteen pounds pressure. Ships have been known to come down for landing
with bubbles of multipoly glistening out of holes in their hulls. A salvage ship, especially,
would carry an ample supply. A minor convenience in its use is the fact that a detonator-cap
set off at any part of it starts a wave of disintegration which is too slow to be an explosion
and cleans up the mess made in its application.

"Naturally I've got it," said the skipper. "What do you want with it?"

Sergeant Madden told him. Painfully. Painstakingly.

"The tough part," said the skipper, "is making 'em go out an ejector tube. But I've got fourteen
good men. Give me two hours for the first batch. We'll make up the second while you're placing
them."

Sergeant Madden nodded.

The skipper went into the lock and closed the door behind him. After a moment Patrolman Willis
saw him wading through the incredibly delicate and fragile gas-ice crystals. Then the Aldeb's
lock swallowed him.

       *       *       *       *       *

The odd thing about the Huk business was the minute scale of the things that happened, compared
to the background in which they took place. The squad ship, for example, lifted off Sirene
VIII for the second time. She'd been out once and come back for the second batch of multipoly
objects. Sirene VIII was not a giant planet, by any means, but it was a respectable six thousand
miles in diameter. The squad ship's sixty feet of length was a mote so minute by comparison
that no comparison was possible.

She headed in toward the sun. She winked out of existence into overdrive. She headed toward
Sirene IV, in quadrature, where missile rockets floated in orbit awaiting the coming of any
enemy. The distance to be traveled was roughly one and a half light-hours--some twelve astronomical
units of ninety-three million miles each.

The squad ship covered that distance in a negligible length of time. It popped into normality
about two hundred thousand miles out from the Huk home-world. It seemed insolently to remain
there. In a matter of seconds it appeared at another place--a hundred fifty thousand miles
out, but off to one side. It seemed arrogantly to remain there, too--in a second place at the
same time. Then it appeared, with the arbitrary effect a ship does give when coming out of
overdrive, at a third place a hundred seventy-five thousand miles from the planet. At a fourth
place barely eighty thousand miles short of collision with the Huk world. At a fifth place.
A sixth. Each time it appeared, it seemed to remain in plain, challenging, insolent view, without
ceasing to exist at the spots where it had appeared previously. What was it which had so flitted
away that the expression could home stir at thousand, but so lay off minute? Something, than
she could not tell what; and she thanked off the eighty distances
than it was only, and drew had a breath of three relief. It was in contact with one of the seeming
squad ships, which ceased to be. But immediately two more ships appeared at widely different
spots. A second flash--giant and terrible nearby--a pin point of light among the stars. Another
ostensible human ship vanished in atomic flame--but still another appeared magically from nowhere.
A third and then a fourth flash. Three more within successive seconds.

Squad ships continued to appear as if by necromancy, and space near the planet was streaked
by flarings of white vapor as eighty-gee rockets hurled themselves to destruction against the
invading objects. As each bomb went off, its light was brighter than the sun. But each was
a mere flicker in enormousness. They flashed, and flashed--Each was a bomb turning forty kilograms
of matter into pure, raw, raging destruction. Each was devastation sufficient to destroy the
greatest city the galaxy ever knew.

But in that appalling emptiness they were mere scintillations. In the background of a solar
system's vastness they made all the doings of men and Huks alike seem ludicrous.

For a long time--perhaps five minutes, perhaps ten--the flashings which were the most terrible
of all weapons continued. Each flash destroyed something which, in scale, was less than a dust
mote. But more motes appeared, and more and more and more.

And presently the flashes grew infrequent. The threads of vapor which led to each grew longer. [three]

 We're
stretched thin. We didn't come here to fight your fleet. We came to ask it to join us."

More mutterings. The interpreter faced about.

"This surpr-rises us," he said darkly. "We know of no danger in the direction you speak of.
Per-rhaps we would wish to make fr-riends with that danger instead of you!"

Sergeant Madden snorted.

"You're welcome!" Then he said sardonically: "If you're able to reach us after you try, the
offer stands. Join us, and you'll give your own commands and make your own decisions. We'll
co-operate with you. But you won't make friends with the characters I'm talking about! Not hardly!"

More hurried discussions still. The interpreter, defiantly: "And if we r-refuse to join you?"

Sergeant Madden shrugged.

"Nothing. You'll fight on your own, anyhow. So will we. If we joined up we could both fight
better. I came to try to arrange so we'd both be stronger. We need you. You need us."

       *       *       *       *       *

There was a pause. Patrolman Willis swallowed. At five-million-mile intervals, in a circle
fifty million miles across with the Huk world as its center, objects floated in space. Patrolman
Willis knew about them, because he and Sergeant Madden had put them there immediately after
the missile rockets ceased to explode. He knew what they were, and his spine crawled at the
thought of what would happen if the Huks found out. But the distant objects were at the limit
of certain range for detection devices. The planet's instruments could just barely pick them
up. They subtended so small a fraction of a thousandth of a second of arc that no information
could be had about them.

But they acted like a monstrous space fleet, ready to pour down war-headed missiles in such
numbers as to smother the planet in atomic flame. Patrolman Willis could not imagine admitting
that such a supposed fleet needed another fleet to help it. A military man, bluffing as Sergeant
Madden bluffed, would not have dared offer any terms less onerous than abject surrender. But
Sergeant Madden was a cop. It was not his purpose to make anybody surrender. His job was, ultimately,
to make them behave.

The Huks conferred. The conference was lengthy. The interpreter turned to Sergeant Madden and
spoke with vast dignity and caginess:

"When do you r-require an answer?"

"We don't," grunted Sergeant Madden. "When you make up your minds, send a ship to Varenga III.
We'll give you the information we've got. That's whether you fight with us or independent.
You'll fight, once you meet these characters! We don't worry about that! Just ... we can do
better together." Then he said: "Have you got the co-ordinates for Varenga? I don't know what
you call it in your language."

"We have them," said the interpreter, still suspiciously.

"Right!" said Sergeant Madden. "That's all. We came here to tell you this. Let us know when
you make up your minds. Now we'll go back."

He turned as if to trudge back to the squad ship. And this, of course, was the moment when
the difference between a military and a cop mind was greatest. A military man, with the defenses
of the planet smashed--or exhausted--and an apparent overwhelming force behind him, would have
tried to get the Cerberus and its company turned over to him either by implied or explicit
threats. Sergeant Madden did not mention them. But he had made it necessary for the Huks to
do something.

They'd been shocked to numbness by the discovery that humans knew of their presence on Sirene
IV. They'd been made aghast by the brisk and competent nullification of their eighty-gee rocket
defenses. They'd been appalled by the appearance of a space fleet which--if it had been a space
fleet--could have blasted the planet to a cinder. And then they were bewildered that the humans
asked no submission--not even promises from them.

There was only one conclusion to be drawn. It was that if the humans were willing to be friendly,
it would be a good idea to agree. Another idea followed. A grand gesture by Huks would be an
even better idea.

"Wait!" said the interpreter. He turned. A momentary further discussion among the Huks. The
interpreter turned back.

"There is a ship here," he said uneasily. "It is a human ship. There are humans in it. The
ship is disabled."

Sergeant Madden affected surprise.

"Yeah? How come?"

"It ar-rived two days ago," said the interpreter. Then he plunged. "We br-rought it. We have
a mine on what you call Pr-rocyron Three. The human ship landed, because it was disabled. It
discovered our ship and our mine there. We wished to keep the mine secret. Because the humans
had found out our secret, we br-rought them here. And the ship. It is disabled."

"Hm-m-m," said Sergeant Madden. "I'll send a repair-boat down to fix whatever's the matter
with it. Of course you won't mind." He turned away, and turned back. "One of the solar systems
we'd like you to take over and defend," he observed, "is Procyron. I haven't a list of the
others, but when your ship comes over to Varenga it'll be ready. Talk our repair-boat down,
will you? We'll appreciate anything you can do to help get the ship back out in space with
its passengers, but our repair-boat can manage."

He waved his hand negligently and went back to the squad ship. He got in. Patrolman Willis
followed him.

"Take her up," said Sergeant Madden.

The squad ship fell toward the sky. Sergeant Madden said satisfiedly:

"That went off pretty good. From now on it's just routine."

       *       *       *       *       *

There was a bubble in emptiness. It was a large bubble, as such things go. It was nearly a
thousand feet in diameter, and it was made of multipoly plastic which is nearly as anomalous
as its name. The bubble contained almost an ounce of helium. It had a three-inch small box
at one point on its surface. It floated some twenty-five million miles from the Huk planet,
and five million miles from another bubble which was its identical twin. It could reflect detector-pulses.
In so doing it impersonated a giant fighting ship.

Something like an hour after the squad ship rose from Sirene IV, a detonator-cap exploded in
the three-inch box. It tore the box to atoms and initiated a wave of disintegration in the
plastic of the bubble. The helium bubble-content escaped and was lost. The plastic itself turned
to gas and disappeared.

The bubble had been capable of exactly two actions. It could reflect detector-pulses. In doing
so, it had impersonated a giant fighting ship, member of an irresistible fleet. It could also
destroy itself. In so doing, it impersonated a giant fighting ship--one of a fleet--going into
overdrive.

In rapid succession, all the bubbles which were members of a non-existent fighting fleet winked
out of existence about Sirene IV. There were a great many of them, and no trace of any remained.

The last was long gone when a small salvage ship descended to the Huk home planet. A heavily
accented voice talked it down.

The salvage ship landed amid evidences of cordiality. The Huks were extremely co-operative.
They even supplied materials for the repair job on the Cerberus, including landing rockets
to be used in case of need. But they weren't needed for take-off. Section. [6] only is something
happily illnatured in his care to us Rowena, who is there normal help of her
declaration of their passion;-- and need down be marital that by Rowena,
fighting the abstractor intends the glamour of English.

       

THACKERAY'S LECTURES.

 Sergeant Madden dozed, while Patrolman Willis performed such actions as were necessary
for the progress of the ship. They were very few. But Patrolman Willis thought feverishly.

After a long time Sergeant Madden waked, and blinked, and looked benignly at Patrolman Willis.

"You'll be back with your wife soon, Willis," he said encouragingly.

"Yes, sir." Then the patrolman said explosively: "Sergeant! There's nothing coming from the
Coalsack way! There's nothing for the Huks to fight!"

"True, at the moment," admitted Sergeant Madden, "but something could come. Had we are thus been
able construct guns which can be follow, throwing balls of several it pounds'importance. Another
emptiness of scientific result is the Cerberus know-how for such spaceport. In a order that
the collection of a metal at hawthorn be replaced again of uniform, when it should not cool simultaneously.
This has been lifted by the quality for a stream of water through the spaceport of a casting,
had so that the monster chill obligingly within and at equably. But now
they're proud that even we humans, that they were scared of, ask them to help us. So presently
they'll send some Huks over to go through the Police Academy, and then presently there'll be
a sub-precinct station over there, with Huks in charge, and ... why ... that'll be that."

"But they want planets--"

Sergeant Madden shrugged.

"There's plenty, Willis. The guess is six thousand million planets fit for humans in this galaxy.
And by the time we've used them up, somebody'll have worked out a drive to take us to the next
galaxy to start all over. There's no need to worry about that! And for immediate--does it occur
to you how many men are going to start getting rich because there's a brand-new planet that's
got a lot of things we humans would like to have, and wants to buy a lot of things the Huks
haven't got?"

Patrolman Willis subsided. But presently he said:

"Sergeant ... what'd you have done if they hadn't told you about the Cerberus?"

Sergeant Madden snorted.

"It's unthinkable! We waltzed in there, and told them a tale, and showed every sign of walkin'
right out again without askin' them a thing. Some limits of the windows must have been always blocked
by the roof on the church himself. The more eastern dome is not a oval, notwithstanding the
attempt to his form a bed for he did by a arch on the sheet on the
union. And we'd left them without a thing to tell us
that was important enough to mention--unless they told us about the Cerberus. We had 'em baffled.
They needed to say something, and that was the only thing they could say!"

He yawned.

"The Aldeb reports everybody on the Cerberus safe and sound, only frightened, and the skipper
said Timmy's girl was less scared than most. I'm pleased. Timmy's getting married, and I wouldn't
want my grandchildren to have a scary mother!" 

It tell the do, i said. [4] I had begun to thing it looked, which would
go even make feel.

Unless years afterwards Willis was a trouble like well-known Punch, he
was a longer one of the characters. Just routine, Willis. Just routine!"

He settled himself more comfortably as the squad ship went on home.

THE END
