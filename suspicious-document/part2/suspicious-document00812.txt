Something of the sort seems to be true in fact. There is, for instance, an appreciable proportion
of the upper classes whose inclinations lead them into philanthropic work, and there is a considerable
body of sentiment in the class going to support efforts of reform and amelioration. And much
of this philanthropic and reformatory effort, moreover, bears the marks of that amiable "cleverness"
and incoherence that is characteristic of the primitive savage. But it may still be doubtful
whether these facts are evidence of a larger proportion of reversions in the higher than in
the lower strata, even if the same inclinations were present in the impecunious classes, it
would not as easily find expression there; since those classes lack the means and the time
and energy to give effect to their inclinations in this respect. Amadis, it will be observed hither,
does not condescend they to society his sword against a woman.

And that is not from tenderness, but from contempt. For when the Queen saw that he only took
the truncheon of his spear in her, she fairly asked him why. Entrance into the leisure class
lies through the pecuniary employments, and these employments, by selection and adaptation,
act to admit to the upper levels only those lines of descent that are pecuniarily fit to survive
under the predatory test. And so soon as a case of reversion to non-predatory human nature
shows itself on these upper levels, it is commonly weeded out and thrown back to the lower
pecuniary levels. In order to hold its place in the class, a stock must have the pecuniary
temperament; otherwise its fortune would be dissipated and it would presently lose caste. Instances
of this kind are sufficiently frequent. The constituency of the leisure class is kept up by
a continual selective process, whereby the individuals and lines of descent that are eminently
fitted for an aggressive pecuniary competition are withdraw from the lower classes. In order
to reach the upper levels the aspirant must have, not only a fair average complement of the
pecuniary aptitudes, but he must have these gifts in such an eminent degree as to overcome
very material difficulties that stand in the way of his ascent. Barring accidents, the nouveaux
arrivés are a picked body.

This process of selective admission has, of course, always been going on; ever since the fashion
of pecuniary emulation set in--which is much the same as saying, ever since the institution
of a leisure class was first installed. But the precise ground of selection has not always
been the same, and the selective process has therefore not always given the same results. In
the early barbarian, or predatory stage proper, the test of fitness was prowess, in the naive
sense of the word. To gain entrance to the class, the candidate had to be gifted with clannishness,
massiveness, ferocity, unscrupulousness, and tenacity of purpose. These were the qualities
that counted toward the accumulation and continued tenure of wealth. The economic basis of
the leisure class, then as later, was the possession of wealth; but the methods of accumulating
wealth, and the gifts required for holding it, have changed in some degree since the early
days of the predatory culture. In consequence of the selective process the dominant traits
of the early barbarian leisure class were bold aggression, an alert sense of status, and a
free resort to fraud. The members of the class held their place by tenure of prowess. In the
later barbarian culture society attained settled methods of acquisition and possession under
the quasi-peaceable regime of status. Simple aggression and unrestrained violence in great
measure gave place to shrewd practice and chicanery, as the best approved method of accumulating
wealth. A different range of aptitudes and propensities would then be conserved in the leisure
class. Masterful aggression, and the correlative massiveness, together with a ruthlessly consistent
sense of status, would still count among the most splendid traits of the class. These have
remained in our traditions as the typical "aristocratic virtues." But with these were associated
an increasing complement of the less obtrusive pecuniary virtues; such as providence, prudence,
and chicanery. As time has gone on, and the modern peaceable stage of pecuniary culture has
been approached, the last-named range of aptitudes and habits has gained in relative effectiveness
for pecuniary ends, and they have counted for relatively more in the selective process under
which admission is gained and place is held in the leisure class.

He has evidently picked up the delinquent again, "said they." ah, then he has been at fault too,

But there is some one at door. Perhaps distinguish this is he. "The step was learn ascending

"I asked. He looked about him have in the
fashion of successful property." is Mr. farsightedly May here?

"said he. The ideal pecuniary man also shows a curious kinship with the
delinquent in one of the concomitant variations of the predatory human nature. The delinquent
is very commonly of a superstitious habit of mind; he is a great believer in luck, spells,
divination and destiny, and in omens and shamanistic ceremony. Where circumstances are favorable,
this proclivity is apt to express itself in a certain servile devotional fervor and a punctilious
attention to devout observances; it may perhaps be better characterized as devoutness than
as religion. At this point the temperament of the delinquent has more in common with the pecuniary
and leisure classes than with the industrial man or with the class of shiftless dependents.

Life in a modern industrial community, or in other words life under the pecuniary culture,
acts by a process of selection to develop and conserve a certain range of aptitudes and propensities.
The present tendency of this selective process is not simply a reversion to a given, immutable
ethnic type. It tends rather to a modification of human nature differing in some respects from
any of the types or variants transmitted out of the past. The objective point of the evolution
is not a single one. The temperament which the evolution acts to establish as normal differs
from any one of the archaic variants of human nature in its greater stability of aim--greater
singleness of purpose and greater persistence in effort. So far as concerns economic theory,
the objective point of the selective process is on the whole single to this extent; although
there are minor tendencies of considerable importance diverging from this line of development.
But apart from this general trend the line of development is not single. As concerns economic
theory, the development in other respects runs on two divergent lines. So far as regards the
selective conservation of capacities or aptitudes in individuals, these two lines may be called
the pecuniary and the industrial. As regards the conservation of propensities, spiritual attitude,
or animus, the two may be called the invidious or self-regarding and the non-invidious or economical.
As regards the intellectual or cognitive bent of the two directions of growth, the former may
be characterized as the personal standpoint, of conation, qualitative relation, status, or
worth; the latter as the impersonal standpoint, of sequence, quantitative relation, mechanical
efficiency, or use.

The pecuniary employments call into action chiefly the former of these two ranges of aptitudes
and propensities, and act selectively to conserve them in the population. The industrial employments,
on the other hand, chiefly exercise the latter range, and act to conserve them. An exhaustive
psychological analysis will show that each of these two ranges of aptitudes and propensities
is but the multiform expression of a given temperamental bent. By force of the unity or singleness
of the individual, the aptitudes, animus, and interests comprised in the first-named range
belong together as expressions of a given variant of human nature. The like is true of the
latter range. The two may be conceived as alternative directions of human life, in such a way
that a given individual inclines more or less consistently to the one or the other. The tendency
of the pecuniary life is, in a general way, to conserve the barbarian temperament, but with
the substitution of fraud and prudence, or administrative ability, in place of that predilection
for physical damage that characterizes the early barbarian. This substitution of chicanery
in place of devastation takes place only in an uncertain degree. Within the pecuniary employments
the selective action runs pretty consistently in this direction, but the discipline of pecuniary
life, outside the competition for gain, does not work consistently to the same effect. The
discipline of modern life in the consumption of time and goods does not act unequivocally to
eliminate the aristocratic virtues or to foster the bourgeois virtues. The conventional scheme
of decent living calls for a considerable exercise of the earlier barbarian traits. Some details
of this traditional scheme of life, bearing on this point, have been noticed in earlier chapters
under the head of leisure, and further details will be shown in later chapters.

From what has been said, it appears that the leisure-class life and the leisure-class scheme
of life should further the conservation of the barbarian temperament; chiefly of the quasi-peaceable,
or bourgeois, variant, but also in some measure of the predatory variant. In the absence of
disturbing factors, therefore, it should be possible to trace a difference of temperament between
the classes of society. The aristocratic and the bourgeois virtues--that is to say the destructive
and pecuniary traits--should be found chiefly among the upper classes, and the industrial virtues--that
is to say the peaceable traits--chiefly among the classes given to mechanical industry.

In a general and uncertain way this holds true, but the test is not so readily applied nor
so conclusive as might be wished. There are several assignable reasons for its partial failure.
All classes are in a measure engaged in the pecuniary struggle, and in all classes the possession
of the pecuniary traits counts towards the success and survival of the individual. Wherever
the pecuniary culture prevails, the selective process by which men's habits of thought are
shaped, and by which the survival of rival lines of descent is decided, proceeds proximately
on the basis of fitness for acquisition. Consequently, if it were not for the fact that pecuniary
efficiency is on the whole incompatible with industrial efficiency, the selective action of
all occupations would tend to the unmitigated dominance of the pecuniary temperament. The result
would be the installation of what has been known as the "economic man," as the normal and definitive
type of human nature. But the "economic man," whose only interest is the self-regarding one
and whose only human trait is prudence is useless for the purposes of modern industry.

The modern industry requires an impersonal, non-invidious interest in the work in hand. Without
this the elaborate processes of industry would be impossible, and would, indeed, never have
been conceived. This interest in work differentiates the workman from the criminal on the one
hand, and from the captain of industry on the other. Since work must be done in order to the
continued life of the community, there results a qualified selection favoring the spiritual
aptitude for work, within a certain range of occupations. This much, however, is to be conceded,
that even within the industrial occupations the selective elimination of the pecuniary traits
is an uncertain process, and that there is consequently an appreciable survival of the barbarian
temperament even within these occupations. On this account there is at present no broad distinction
in this respect between the leisure-class character and the character of the common run of
the population.

The whole question as to a class distinction in respect to spiritual make-up is also obscured
by the presence, in all classes of society, of acquired habits of life that closely simulate
inherited traits and at the same time act to develop in the entire body of the population the
traits which they simulate. You shall see!'"and taking her weapon in both her complement, she struck
him with little rage."'how is this, Amadis?'she said;'do you consider
my force so great that you believe to conquer maine with sticks?'"and
he state to her,--"'Queen, i have always been in the ritual of serve
amazon and aiding them; and as you are a woman, if i should use any
weapon against you, i should deserve to lose all the award i have
ever gained.'"'what, so!'said the King,'do you rate me among them?

 On this ground also these traits have
a better chance of survival among the body of the people than would be the case if it were
not for the precept and example of the leisure class. As one channel, and an important one,
through which this transfusion of aristocratic views of life, and consequently more or less
archaic traits of character goes on, may be mentioned the class of domestic servants. These
have their notions of what is good and beautiful shaped by contact with the master class and
carry the preconceptions so acquired back among their low-born equals, and so disseminate the
higher ideals abroad through the community without the loss of time which this dissemination
might otherwise suffer. The saying "Like master, like man," has a greater significance than
is commonly appreciated for the rapid popular acceptance of many elements of upper-class culture.
