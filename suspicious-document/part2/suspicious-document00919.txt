[180] The motives for the massacre of Jaffa are given by Bourrienne in so impartial a manner,
that we are inclined to believe he has given a true transcript of his master's mind. "Bonaparte
sent his aids-de-camp, Beauharnais and Crosier, to appease as far as possible the fury of the
soldiery, to examine what passed, and to report. They learned that a numerous detachment of
the garrison had retired into a strong position, where large buildings surrounded a courtyard.
This court they entered, displaying the scarfs which marked their rank. The Albanians and Arnauts,
composing nearly the entire of these refugees, cried out from the windows that they wished
to surrender, on condition their lives were spared; if not, threatening to fire upon the officers,
and to defend themselves to the last extremity. The young men conceived they ought, and had
power, to accede to the demand, in opposition to the sentence of death pronounced against the
garrison of every place taken by assault. I was walking with General Bonaparte before his tent
when these prisoners, in two columns, amounting to about four thousand men, were marched into
the camp. When he beheld the mass of men arrive, and before seeing the aids-de-camp, he turned
to me with an expression of consternation, 'What would they have me to do with these? Have
I provisions to feed them; ships to transport them either to Egypt or France? How the devil
could they play me this trick!' The two aids-de-camp, on their arrival and explanations, received
the strongest reprimands. To their defence, namely, that they were alone amid numerous enemies,
and that he had recommended to them to appease the slaughter, he replied, in the sternest tone,
'Yes, without doubt, the slaughter of women, children, old men, the peaceable inhabitants,
but not of armed soldiers; you ought to have braved death, and not brought these to me. What
would you have me do with them?' But the evil was done. Four thousand men were there--their
fate must be determined. The prisoners were made to sit down, huddled together before the tents,
their hands being bound behind them. A gloomy rage was depicted to every lineament. A council
was held in the general's tent," &c.

On the third day an order was issued that the prisoners should be shot,--an order which was
literally executed on four thousand men. "The atrocious crime," says M. Bourrienne, "makes
me yet shudder when I think of it, as when it passed before me. All that can be imagined of
fearful on this day of blood would fall short of the reality!"--Memoirs, vol i. p. 156.
