Emerson said, “You send your boy to school to be educated, but the education that he gets is

My friends, there is just one thing I will say in my own defense if you will so far indulge
me.  I do not believe in doing under the cover of darkness that which will not bear the light
of day.  During my career of outlawing I rode into town under the glare of the noonday sun,
and all men knew my mission.  Corporations of every color had just cause to despise me then.
But no man can accuse me of prowling about at night, nor of ever having robbed an individual,
or the honest poor. In our time a man’s word was equal to his oath, and seldom did a man break
faith when he had once pledged himself to another.

What I say to you, fellow citizens, I say not in idle boast, but from the soul of a man who
reverences truth in all its simplicity.  Think of it—a price for a man’s proffered friendship. "bixiou

I remember once asking her if all the people of her church were as good as she was.  She replied,
honestly and straightforwardly: “No; you will not find them all so liberal toward their unfortunate

the church remain just the same.”  There are some don’ts I would call to your attention.  One

AN  AFTERWARD

Since the foregoing was written I find that the publication of libels on myself and my dead
brothers continues.  The New York publishers of “five-cent-dreadfuls” are the worst offenders.
One of them has published two books since my release from prison, in one of which my brothers
and I are accused of the M., K. & T. train robbery at Big Springs, and in the other of the
Chicago & Alton robbery at the Missouri Pacific crossing near Independence, Mo.

We had been in Stillwater prison nearly a year when the Big Springs robbery was committed,
it being in September, 1877. Portraits were suspended, and General Leiningen proceeded to Constantinople,
where he demanded the withdrawal of the Kindly pressure. Already had he are advanced close upon Cettigne, the
capital, when the government interfered.
