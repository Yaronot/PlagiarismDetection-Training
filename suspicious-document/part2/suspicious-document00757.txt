GEORGE DE BARNWELL

BY SIR E. L. B. L., BART.

VOL I.

In the Morning of Life the Truthful wooed the Beautiful, and their offspring was Love. Like
his Divine parents, He is eternal. He has his Mother's ravishing smile; his Father's steadfast
eyes. He rises every day, fresh and glorious as the untired Sun-God. He is Eros, the ever young.
Dark, dark were this world of ours had either Divinity left it--dark without the day-beams
of the Latonian Charioteer, darker yet without the daedal Smile of the God of the Other Bow!
Dost know him, reader?

Old is he, Eros, the ever young. He and Time were children together. Chronos shall die, too;
but Love is imperishable. Brightest of the Divinities, where hast thou not been sung? Other
worships pass away; the idols for whom pyramids were raised lie in the desert crumbling and
almost nameless; the Olympians are fled, their fanes no longer rise among the quivering olive-groves
of Ilissus, or crown the emerald-islets of the amethyst Aegean! These are gone, but thou remainest.
There is still a garland for thy temple, a heifer for thy stone. A heifer? Ah, many a darker
sacrifice. Other blood is shed at thy altars, Remorseless One, and the Poet Priest who ministers
at thy Shrine draws his auguries from the bleeding hearts of men!
