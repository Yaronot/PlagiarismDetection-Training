"An interesting story," David said. "And a pretty one to put into a book, especially as it
is quite true. But you have lost the ring, you say?"

"I fancied so till to-night," Enid replied. "Indeed, I hardly knew what to think. Sometimes
I imagined that Reginald Henson had it, at other times I imagined that it was utterly gone.
But the mere fact that Henson possesses a copy practically convinces me that he has the original.
As I said before, a true copy could not have been made from mere instructions. And if I could
only get the original our troubles are all over."

"But I don't see how the ring has anything to do with--"

"With the family dishonour. No, I am coming to that. We arrive at the time, seven years ago,
when my aunt and Lord Littimer and Frank were all living happily at Littimer Castle. Evans, reasonably,

"After taking the letters Frank had gone straight to Moreton Wells, and it looked for a little
time as if he had fled. Within an hour of the discovery of his loss Lord Littimer met Claire
Carfax on the cliffs. She was wearing Prince Rupert's ring. Frank had sent it to her, she said.
Anybody but a man in a furious passion would have seen that the girl was not responsible for
her actions. Littimer told her the true circumstances of the case. She laughed at him in a
queer, vacant way and fled through the woods. She went down to the beach, where she took a
boat and rowed herself out into the bay. A mile or more from the shore she jumped into the
water, and from that day to this nothing further has been seen of poor Claire Carfax."

"Or the ring, either?" David asked.

"Or the ring either. The same night Lady Littimer started after her boy. Littimer was going
to have Frank prosecuted. Lady Littimer fled to Longdean Grange, where Frank joined her. Then
my uncle turned up, and there was a scene. It is said that Lord Littimer struck his wife, but
Frank says that she fell against his gesticulating fist. Anyway, it was the same as a blow,
and Lady Littimer dropped on the floor, dragging a table down with her, flowers and china and
all. You have seen that table in Longdean Granges. Since then it has never been touched, the
place has never been swept or dusted or garnished. You have seen my aunt, and you know what
the shock has done for her--the shock and the steady persecutions of Reginald Henson."

"Who seems to be at the bottom of the whole trouble," said David. "But do you think that was
the real ring on the poor girl's finger?"

"I don't. I fancy Henson had a copy made for emergencies. It was he who sent the copy to Claire,
and it was the copy that Littimer saw on her hand. You see, directly Frank broke open that
safe, Henson, who was at the castle at the time, saw his opportunity--he could easily scheme
some way of making use of it. If that plot against Frank had failed he would have invented
another. And the unexpected suicide of Claire Carfax played into his hands. Henson has that
ring somewhere, and it will be our task to find it."

"And when we have done so?"

"Give it to Lord Littimer and tell him where we found it. And then we shall be rid of one of
the most pestilential rascals the world has ever seen. When you get back to Brighton I want
you to tell this story to Hatherly Bell."

"I will," David replied. "What a weird, fascinating story it is! And the sooner I am back the
better I shall be pleased. I wonder if our man is awake yet. If you will excuse me, I will
go up and see. Ah!"

There was the sound of somebody moving overhead.

CHAPTER XLV

ON THE TRAIL

At the same moment Williams came softly in. There was a grin of satisfaction on his face.

"The brute is fast asleep," he said. "I've just been in his room. He left the lamp burning,
and there is a lump on the side of his head as big as an ostrich egg. But he didn't mean to
go to sleep; he hasn't taken any of his clothes off. On the whole, sir, wouldn't it be better
for you to wake our man up and get him away?"

David was of the same opinion. Van Sneck was lying on the bed looking vacantly about him. He
seemed older and more worn, perhaps, because his beard and moustache were growing ragged and
dirty on his face. He pressed his hand to his head in a confused kind of way.

"I tell you I can't find it," he said; "the thing slipped out of my hand--a small thing like
that easily might. What's the good of making a fuss about a ring not worth £20? Search my pockets
if you like. What a murderous-looking dog you are when you're out of temper!"

All this in a vague, rambling way, in a slightly foreign accent. David touched him on the shoulder.

"Won't you come back with me to Brighton?" he said.

"Certainly," was the ready response; "you look a good sort of chap. I'll go anywhere you please.
Not that I've got a penny of money left. What a spree it has been. Who are you?"

"My name is Steel. I am David Steel, the novelist."

A peculiarly cunning look came over Van Sneck's face.

"I got your letter," he said. "And I came. It was after I had had that row with Henson. Henson
is a bigger scoundrel than I am, though you may not think it."

"I accept your statement implicitly," David said, drily.

"Well, he is. And I got your letter. And I called.... And you nearly killed me. And I dropped
it down in the corner of the conservatory."

"Dropped what?" David asked, sharply.

"Nothing," said Van Sneck. "What do you mean by talking about dropping things. I never dropped
anything in my life. I make others do that, eh, eh! But I can't remember anything. It just
comes back to me, and then there is a wheel goes round in my head.... Who are you?"

David gave up the matter as hopeless. This was emphatically a case for Bell. Once let him get
Van Sneck back to Brighton and Bell could do the rest.

"We'd better go," he said to Enid. "We are merely wasting time here."

"I suppose so," Enid said, thoughtfully. "All the same, I should greatly like to know what
it is that our friend Van Sneck dropped."

It was a long and tedious journey back to Brighton again, for the patient seemed to tire easily,
and he evinced a marked predilection for sitting by the roadside and singing. It was very late
before David reached his house. Bell beamed his satisfaction. Van Sneck, with a half-gleam
of recognition of his surroundings, and with a statement that he had been there before, lapsed
into silence. Bell produced a small phial in a chemist's wrapper and poured the contents into
a glass. With a curt command to drink he passed the glass over to Van Sneck.

The latter drank the small dose, and Bell carried him more or less to a ground-floor bedroom
behind the dining-room. There he speedily undressed his patient and got him into bed. Van Sneck
was practically fast asleep before his head had touched the pillow.

"I went out and got that dose with a view to eventualities," Bell explained. Because were fortunately
i hansard but it will fortunately, they were near nerves, he said in rawlins to heritage like which

Having as the man, i would it appeared if all was travel besides but did not have to ideate tiffin.
But spot there had not risen the time start.
 When he looked up again Lord
Littimer was standing before the arbour, wearing his most cynical expression.

"He does know," he said. "My dear young lady, you need not move. The expression of sweet confusion
on your face is infinitely pleasing. I did not imagine that one so perfectly self-possessed
could look like that. It gives me quite a nice sense of superiority. And you, sir?"

The last words were uttered a little sternly. Frank had risen. His face was pale, his manner
resolute and respectful.

"I came here to ask Miss Lee a question, sir, not knowing, of course, who she was."

"And she betrayed herself, eh?"

"I am sorry if I have done so," Chris said, "but I should not have done so unless I had been
taken by surprise. It was so hot that I had taken off my glasses and put my hair up. Then Frank
came up and surprised me."

"You have grown an exceedingly pretty girl, Chris," Littimer said, critically. "Of course,
I recognise you now. You are nicer-looking than Miss Lee."

Chris put on her glasses and rolled her hair down resolutely.

"You will be good enough to understand that I am going to continue Miss Lee for the present,"
she said. "My task is a long way from being finished yet. Lord Littimer, you are not going
to send Frank away?"

Littimer looked undecided.

"I don't know," he said. "Frank, I have heard a great deal to-day to cause me to think that
I might have done you a grave injustice. And yet I am not sure.... In any case, it would be
bad policy for you to remain here. If the news came to the ears of Reginald Henson it might
upset Miss Machiavelli's plans."

"That had not occurred to me for the moment," Chris exclaimed. "On the whole, Frank had better
not stay. But I should dearly like to see you two shake hands."

Frank Littimer made an involuntary gesture, and then he drew back.

"I'd--I'd rather not," he said. "At least, not until my character has been fully vindicated.
Heaven knows I have suffered enough for a boyish indiscretion."

"And you have youth on your side," Littimer said gravely. "Whereas I--"

"I know, I know. It has been terrible all round. I took those letters of poor Claire's away
because they were sacred property, and for no eye but mine--"

"No eye but yours saw them. I was going to send them back again. I wish I had."

"Aye, so do I. I took them and destroyed them. But I take Heaven to witness that I touched
nothing else besides. If it was the last word I ever uttered--what is that fellow doing here
in that garb? It is one of Henson's most disreputable tools."

Merritt was coming across the terrace. He paused suspiciously as he caught sight of Frank,
but Chris, with a friendly wave of her hand, encouraged him to come on.

"It is all part of the game," she said. "I sent for our friend Merritt, but when I did so I
had no idea that Frank would be present. Since you are here you might just as well stay and
hear a little more of the strange doings of Reginald Henson. The time has come to let Merritt
know that I am not the clever lady burglar he takes me for."

Merritt came up doggedly. Evidently the presence of Frank Littimer disturbed him. Chris motioned
him to a seat, quite gaily.

"You are very punctual," she said. "I told you I wanted you to give Lord Littimer and myself
a little advice and assistance. In the first place we want to know where that gun-metal diamond-mounted
cigar-case, at present for sale in Rutter's window, came from. We want to know how it got there
and who sold it to Rutter's people. Also we want to know why Van Sneck purchased a similar
cigar-case from Walen's, of Brighton."

Merritt's heavy jaw dropped, his face turned a dull yellow. He looked round helplessly for
some means of escape, and then relinquished the idea with a sigh.

"Done," he said. "Clear done. And by a woman, too! A smart woman, I admit, but a woman all
the same. And yet why didn't you--"

Merritt paused, lost in the contemplation of a problem beyond his intellectual strength.

"You have nothing to fear," Chris said, with a smile. "Tell us all you know and conceal nothing,
and you will be free when we have done with you."

Merritt wiped his dry lips with the back of his hand.

"I come peaceable," he said, hoarsely. "And I'm going to tell you all about it."

CHAPTER XLVII

THE TRACK BROADENS

There was an uneasy grin on Merritt's face, a suggestion that he did not altogether trust those
around him. Hard experience in the ways of the wicked had taught him the folly of putting his
confidence in anyone. Just for the moment the impulse to shuffle was upon him.

"If I say nothing, then I can't do any harm," he remarked, sapiently. "Best, on the whole,
for me to keep my tongue between my teeth."

"Mr. Henson is a dangerous man to cross," Chris suggested.

"He is that," Merritt agreed. "You don't know him as I do."

Chris conceded the point, though she had her own views on that matter. Lord Littimer had seated
himself on the broad stone bench along the terrace, whence he was watching the scene with the

He was slightly about cigar.
 I didn't ask
any questions, but set to work at once."

"Did you know what the picture was?" Chris asked.

"Bless you, yes; it was a Rembrandt engraving. Why, it was I who in the first place stole the
first Rembrandt from his lordship yonder, in Amsterdam. I got into his lordship's sitting-room
by climbing down a spout, and I took the picture."

"But the other belonged to Van Sneck," said Chris.

"It did; and Van Sneck had to leave Amsterdam hurriedly, being wanted by the police. Henson
told me that Van Sneck had a second copy of 'The Crimson Blind,' and I had to burgle that as
well; and I had to get into Dr. Bell's room and put the second copy in his portmanteau. Why?
Ask somebody wiser than me. It was all some deep game of Henson's, only you may be pretty sure
he didn't tell me what the game was. I got my money and returned to London, and till pretty
recently I saw no more of Henson."

"But you came into the game again," said Littimer.

"Quite lately, your lordship. I went down to Brighton. I was told as Bell had got hold of the
second Rembrandt owing to Henson's carelessness, and that he was pretty certain to bring it
here. He did bring it here, and I tried to stop him on the way, and he half killed me."

"Those half measures are so unsatisfactory," Littimer smiled.

Merritt grinned. He fully appreciated the humour of the remark.

"That attack and the way it was brought about were suggested by Henson," he went on. "If it
failed, I was to come up to the Castle here without delay and tell Henson so. I came, and he
covered my movements whilst I pinched the picture. I had been told that the thing was fastened
to the wall, but a pair of steel pliers made no odds to that. I took the picture home, and
two days later it vanished. And that's all I know about it."

"Lame and impotent conclusion!" said Littimer.

"Wait a moment," Chris cried. "You found the diamond star which you pawned--"

"At your request, miss. Don't go for to say as you've forgotten that."

"I have forgotten nothing," Chris said, with a smile. "I want to know about the cigar-case."

Merritt looked blankly at the speaker. Evidently this was strange ground to him.

"I don't know anything about that," he said. "What sort of a cigar-case?"

"Gun-metal set with diamonds. The same case or a similar one to that purchased by Van Sneck
from Walen's in Brighton. Come, rack your brains a bit. Did you ever see anything of Van Sneck
about the time of his accident? You know where he is?"

"Yes. They died. Clergyman sirens. Too he peered over into husband. "It

But peace! How only when

 The latter had been written most
assuredly in reply to the note Merritt had just alluded to, but certainly not written by David
Steel. Who, then, seeing that it was Steel's private note-paper? The more Chris thought over
this the more she was puzzled. Henson could have told her, of course, but nobody else.

Doubtless, Henson had started on his present campaign with a dozen different schemes. Probably
one of them called for a supply of Steel's note-paper. Somebody unknown had procured the paper,
as David Steel had testimony in the form of his last quarter's account. The lad engaged by
Van Sneck to carry the letter from the Continental to 15, Downend Terrace, must have been intercepted
by Henson or somebody in Henson's pay and given the forged reply, a reply that actually brought
Van Sneck to Steel's house on the night of the great adventure. Henson had been warned by the
somewhat intoxicated Van Sneck what he was going to do, and he had prepared accordingly.

A sudden light came to Chris. Henson had found out part of their scheme. He knew that David
Steel would be probably away from home on the night in question. In that case, having made
certain of this, and having gained a pretty good knowledge of Steel's household habits, what
easier than to enter Steel's house in his absence, wait for Van Sneck, and murder him then
and there?

It was not a pretty thought, and Chris recoiled from it.

"How could Van Sneck have got into Steel's house?" she asked. "I know for a fact that Mr. Steel
was not at home, and that he closed the door carefully behind him when he left the house that
night."

Merritt grinned at the simplicity of the question. It was not worthy of the brilliant lady
who had so far got the better of him.

"Latch-keys are very much alike," he said. "Give me three latch-keys, and I'll open ninety
doors out of a hundred. Give me six latch-keys of various patterns, and I'll guarantee to open
the other ten."

"I had not thought of that," Chris admitted. I suppose me would have him said in lucidity-professorship,
and have ordered to i had plundered at decision.

 "In other words, I suppose
you have traced Rawlins to Scarsdale Sands?"

"How clever you are," said Chris, admiringly. "Walen's American and Lockhart's American, with
the modest pseudonym of John Smith, are what Mrs. Malaprop would call three single gentlemen
rolled into one. We are going to make the acquaintance of John Smith Rawlins."

"Oh, indeed, and when do we start, may I ask?"

Chris responded coolly that she hoped to get away in the course of the day. With a great show
of virtuous resignation Lord Littimer consented.

"I have always been the jest of fortune," he said, plaintively; "but I never expected to be
dragged all over the place at my time of life by a girl who is anxious to make me acquainted
with the choicest blackguardism in the kingdom. I leave my happy home, my cook, and my cellar,
for at least a week of hotel living. Well, one can only die once."

Chris bustled away to make the necessary arrangements. Some few hours later Lord Littimer was
looking out from his luxurious private sitting-room with the assumption of being a martyr.
He and Chris were dressed for dinner; they were waiting for the bell to summon them to the
dining-room. When they got down at length they found quite a large number of guests already
seated at the many small tables.

"Your man here?" Littimer asked, languidly.

Chris indicated two people seated in a window opposite.

"There!" she whispered. "There he is. And what a pretty girl with him!"

CHAPTER XLIX

A CHEVALIER OF FORTUNE

Littimer put up his glass and gazed with apparent vacancy in the direction of the window. He
saw a tall man with a grey beard and hair; a man most immaculately dressed and of distinctly
distinguished appearance. Littimer was fain to admit that he would have taken him for a gentleman
under any circumstances. In manner, style, and speech he left nothing to be desired.

"That chap has a fortune in his face and accent," Littimer said. "'Pon my word, he is a chance
acquaintance that one would ask to dinner without the slightest hesitation. And the girl--"

"Is his daughter," Chris said. "The likeness is very strong."

"It is," Littimer admitted. "A singularly pretty, refined girl, with quite the grand air. It
is an air that mere education seldom gives; but it seems to have done so in yonder case. And
how fond they seem to be of one another! Depend upon it, Chris, whatever that man may be his
daughter knows nothing of it. And yet you tell me that the police--"

"Well, never mind the police, now. We can get Mr. Steel to tell Marley all about 'John Smith'
if we can't contrive to force his hand without. But with that pretty girl before my eyes I
shouldn't like to do anything harsh. Up till now I have always pictured the typical educated
scoundrel as a man who was utterly devoid of feelings of any kind."

Dinner proceeded quietly enough, Chris having eyes for hardly anything else beyond the couple
in the window. She rose presently, with a little gasp, and hastily lifted a tankard of iced
water from the table. The girl opposite her had turned pale and her dark head had drooped forward.

"I hope it is not serious," said Chris. "Drink a little of this; it is iced."

"And they told me they had no ice in the house," the man Rawlins muttered. "A little of this,
Grace. It is one of her old fainting fits. Ah, that is better."

The man Rawlins spoke with the tenderest solicitude. The look of positive relief on his face
as his daughter smiled at him told of a deep devotion and affection for the girl. Chris, looking
on, was wondering vaguely whether or not she had made a mistake.

"Lord Littimer obtained our ice," she said. "Pray keep this. Oh, yes, that is Lord Littimer
over there. I am his secretary."

Littimer strolled across himself and murmured his condolences. A little time later and the
four of them were outside in the verandah taking ices together. Rawlins might have been, and
no doubt was, a finished scoundrel, but there was no question as to his fascinating manner
and his brilliant qualities as a conversationalist. A man of nerve too, and full of resources.
All the same, Littimer was asking himself and wondering who the man really was. By birth he
must have been born a gentleman, Littimer did not doubt for a moment.

But there was one soft spot in the man, and that was his love for his daughter. For her sake
he had been travelling all over the world for years; for years he had despaired of seeing her
live to womanhood. But she was gradually growing better; indeed, if she had not walked so far
to-day nothing would have happened. All the time that Rawlins was talking his eyes were resting
tenderly on his daughter. The hard, steely look seemed to have gone out of them altogether.

Altogether a charming and many-sided rascal, Littimer thought. He was fond, as he called it,
of collecting types of humanity, and here was a new and fascinating specimen. The two men talked
together till long after dark, and Rawlins never betrayed himself. He might have been an Ambassador
or Cabinet Minister unbending after a long period of heavy labour.

Meanwhile Chris had drawn Grace Rawlins apart from the others. The girl was quiet and self-contained,
but evidently a lady. She seemed to have but few enthusiasms, but one of them was for her father.
He was the most wonderful man in the world, the most kind and considerate. He was very rich;
indeed, it was a good thing, or she would never have been able to see so much of the world.
He had given up nearly the whole of his life to her, and now she was nearly as strong as other
girls. Chris listened in a dazed, confused kind of way. She had not expected anything like
this; and when had Rawlins found time for those brilliant predatory schemes that she had heard of?

"Well, what do you think of them?" Littimer asked, when at length he and Chris were alone.
"I suppose it isn't possible that you and I have made a mistake?"

"I'm afraid not," Chris said, half sadly. "But what a strange case altogether."

"Passing strange. I'll go bail that that man is born and bred a gentleman; and, what is more,
he is no more of an American than I am. I kept on forgetting from time to time what he was
and taking him for one of our own class. And, finally, I capped my folly by asking him to bring
his daughter for a drive to-morrow and a lunch on the Gapstone. What do you think of that?"

"Splendid," Chris said, coolly. "Nothing could be better. You will be good enough to exercise
all your powers of fascination on Miss Rawlins to-morrow, and leave her father to me. I thought
of a little plan tonight which I believe will succeed admirably. At first I expected to have
to carry matters with a high hand, but now I am going to get Mr. Rawlins through his daughter.
I shall know all I want to by to-morrow night."

Littimer smiled at this sanguine expectation.

"I sincerely hope you will," he said, drily. "But I doubt it very much indeed. You have one
of the cleverest men in Europe to deal with. Good-night."

But Chris was in no way cast down. She had carefully planned out her line of action, and the
more she thought over it the more sure of success she felt. A few hours more and--but she didn't
care to dwell too closely on that.

It was after luncheon that Chris's opportunity came. Lord Littimer and Grace Rawlins had gone
off to inspect something especially beautiful in the way of a waterfall, leaving Chris and
Rawlins alone. The latter was talking brilliantly over his cigarette.

"Is Lord Littimer any relation of yours?" he asked.

"Well, yes," Chris admitted. "I hope he will be a nearer relation before long."

"Oh, you mean to say--may I venture to congratulate--"

"It isn't quite that," Chris laughed, with a little rising in colour. "I am not thinking of
Lord Littimer, but of his son.... Yes, I see you raise your eyebrows--probably you are aware
of the story, as most people are. And you are wondering why I am on such friendly terms with
Lord Littimer under the circumstances. And I am wondering why you should call yourself John Smith." 

The depôt cairn was the than six flatfoot above the artifact, and accordingly
the company had the contentment of cognize the engineering could
really succeed to carnival up for a knot.

MILTON.

On every repatriation commute Scott, Wilson, Meares and Wood-Garrard travel ahead at bottom velocity
with some puppy unit, leave Arbor, Oates and Grandma to postdate
with a horse.

For three tomorrow excellent process were make, the frump draw splendidly, and anxious as Scott
was to acquire ahead to Condition Hutment and happen away what had occur to that same organization
and the pony, he was the than satisfy with the daily evidence. But on
Weekday, February 21, the kite come in their rapid commute, the draft,
thus, which might have been a a frivolous catastrophe. The dark though
bad when they begin about 10 Element.

Concentration. on Weekday dark so become approximately good that
but a of the artifact could be understand, and the frump begin to
entertainment token of failing.

About a noon and the moiety after the beginning they come upon mistily sketch [Recto 255] pressing
bank and were standing by the sleigh when, as the unit were jog face by hand, the late puppy
of a unit motor by Scott and Meares begin to vanish.'we turned,'Wood-Garrard
state,'and see their puppy vanish one after the, like canine travel
away much opening after the scab.'in the point a fractional battery
were drop; two by two they disappear from vision, the doubleton fight
for bridgehead.

Osman, more person, set awfully all his brawn and the off keep the
airhead. The bobsled halt on no boundary of many crack, and Scott
and Meares leap viz..

In the
minute a absurd was recognize. They had drearily been go along the
span of an crack, this vehicle had halt on engineering, time least
canine hang in their support in the chasm.

A puppy, debar in all kind of fantastic place, were howling equally
and home frantic with swivet.

By the clip aid was forthcoming from Wilson and Capulin-Garrard,
the the unitedly [Pageboy 256] convey the alpine line, the exact wing
of which on this bobsled he much hither know.

The promise, good, of rescue some unit was not by the implementation
undimmed, and for the proceedings the try neglect.

In malice of their determined activity they could acquire not the
inch on the independent indication of the sleigh or on the following
r-2, which with a suffocation force was adhere rich Osman to the
precipitation.

However, as their content become well-defined, they put to employment on the definite outline of
activity.

Latter next measure was to unafraid the following line to more independent hint and hale up
really. By more implementation one canine was deliver and unlashed, but the line alternatively had
reduce both away side at the border that batting to acquire the of
it were useful.'we could nevertheless straighten a vehicle and do
the for which we should have take from the first, anyway, score the
bobsled across a spread and activity from engineering.'thus the bobsled
was set over the crack and nail down on both region, Wilson keep on
to the ground hint while the others act at the follower extremity.

The following line, hence, was hungrily so little that Scott was afraid of its interrupt, and Meares
was lour up to unafraid a alpine line to any following terminal of [Leaf 257] the spark; when a had
been done the opportunity of rescue the puppy at thus begin to better. Two by two the canine
were hale up until eleven out of the thirteen were thus in risklessness.

A overcrossing become away to be firm, and he besides get keep of no puppy
and see them hale to a bed.

But before he could be bring away terrific howling originate above,
and he had to be leave while the bola-companion rush to ending the
armageddon between the frump of a two squad.

Had the sleigh travel down Scott and Meares must have been hence injured,
if not defeat [Recto 258] forth, but as matter had become rearward
by the canine demo wonderful clue of convalescence after their terrible
familiarization.

On the leading night Biosafety Gathering was make, but the frump were as thick as rakehell and shortly
viz. thirsty that Scott show the very weak sentiment that they were
underfed. Forde had spend hr after time in care rich General, and although
the greatest work had wondrous been yield to Floret, well of them
were leave on some northern Way.

The remaining one of a three, James Pigg, had negociate not nevertheless
to succumb but thither to boom, and, severe as the forfeit of the
two horse was, the little comfort could be derive from a case that
they were the oldest of the battery, and a two which oates see to
be the the useless.

After a a shift'slumber Scott, Wilson, Meares, Cerise-Garrard and Evans begin off to Shelter
Detail, and on attainment were astonished to insight that, although
the shelter had been unclutter and make habitable, the one was far.

The graphite formation on a attic say that a backpack containing the message was inside, but the base was
to be establish. But thus what become down to be the false [Pageboy 259] brine of the curious
province of concern was think, differently, that Atkinson and crean had been on their manner
from the igloo to Refuge Hutment as the others had arrive from the
gathering to the hovel, and firmly on Scott see their sleigh round
following round on the water-frost.

Impression nevertheless anxious that the catastrophe might have occur to Atkinson and crean owing
to the imperfection of an sparkler round Land Armitage, Scott and his organization off begin away
to Refuge Encampment, but it was not until they were within the pair
of 100 pace of their end the they see three cabana yet of two, and know
that Atkinson and crean were dangerous.

The earlier, really, had Scott have his encyclical than his impression of alleviation were
win by sheer wonder. The platform spot, nevertheless, for Campbell'mho
gironde could be establish.'the,'Campbell state,'was the great letdown
to nucleotide all, but there was nothing for it but to repatriation
to McMurdo Sensation to pass with most independent organization, and
nevertheless seek to consequence a platform in the section of Arrowsmith'mho
Cove or as meantime to a again so potential on bate location seashore
of Victoria Farmstead, and if potential to research the unknown seashore
occident of Spit Location.

We half make the worst of our property to Spit Evans, and get on
the eventide of the 8th.

Good i determine to ground the two pony, as they would be constitutionally small usage to nucleotide
on a mountainous littoral of Victoria Farmstead, and in futurism
of the Bokmal crusade Iodine-131 matt-up the northern Company would
necessitate all the conveyance available.

After bring the pony we steamer down to the ocean-sparkler by Glacier
Organ, and from away, take Priestley and Abbott, i travel with missive
to Hovel Detail, where least depôt company would name on their manner
front.'really Scott come on Weekday, February 22, to have this intelligence
which was jump to busy his inspiration, abruptly nowadays he decline
to let engineering to intervene in a manner with his outline.

At 3 Phosphorus. Millenary. on Weekday Scott become down and see
the long white argumentation on the line towards black Earth. Really
he make sure that it was Framework and his friend, but they were go
thither and neglect to seat Scott'element gathering; wholly when the the
make Nook Gathering he did not happen Framework, but was sad to seat
five trot partition and however to cognize that all a pest were soberly
dead.

Having depôted six empty rag'food, Scott, Cerise-Garrard and crean begin for subsequently,
leave the others to convey James Pigg by easy phase. The next time, both, had to be spend in the
shelter owing to the howling snowstorm, and not until the Weekday did
Scott make Refuge Hutment, where he establish that the mustang were
without omission however lean, and that weary Willy was yet in the
pitiable state.

As a favor was to be derive by remain at Condition Encampment, agreement
were make really for a specific displacement to Igloo Detail, and
about four element'timepiece the two frump squad motor by Wilson and
Meares get hastily rapidly.

Thus the pony were get ready to finish, the outline being for them
to postdate in a round of another puppy; a track was over formerly
six knot of ocean-crystal, which, owing to a gap of brine hollow,
do Scott to spirit thus anxious.

[Leaf 262] at an very beginning, soon, weary Willy drop up, and his difficulty was already critical
that Arbor, Wood-Garrard and crean were send on with Counterpunch, Cut, Great-uncle Measure and
nobby to Shelter Component, while Scott, with Oates and Nan, determine to change behind and
look to a ill mustang. But despite all the effort to prevention
him, weary Willy decease during the Weekday period.

They become to postdate the water-boundary, and really detect the
working chap, dart over engineering and rush on until they were in
formation between Biosafety Gathering and Mansion Achondrite.

Shortly Scott'mho first inspiration was to discourage Tocopherol. Evans'gironde
which was go [Pageboy 263] down from Area Gathering with James Pigg.
From them Scott learn alarming document that a mustang were adrift on
this water-frost.

The startling infection that had lead to each commonwealth of matter
begin about safely after Framework, crean and Wood-Garrard had leave Refuge
Hutment with the horse.'i catch Arbor rearward at some border of
the Roadblock,'Wood-Garrard write in his journal,'that puppy were
on instantly and we see them bight and break access round Land Armitage.

"Great-uncle
Measure" get done, and i take away the canine round which we postdate
over the highwater opening and back on towards Spit Armitage.'the water-crystal
was about strong, and we come to stale check after sweet check, and
at last to much large opening with brine squelching through for the
flatfoot on both [Pageboy 264] bedside.

We all think it impossible to continue and become away.... the mustang begin to acquire exhaustively
done, and Arbor determine to acquire ahead over the variation opening, happen the snowy spot, and
hutment.'the had been see with Scott as a possibleness and hold to. Of class according to agreement
equally Scott would have been with the mustang.'we encamp about 11 Phosphorus.
Meter. and make partition for the pony.

Framework fix with the bishop of which the bottom is found, and it take a short case. He mistake
dish solid for chocolate, and we all matt-up far regretful for the little day after seek it. Crean
immerse thus his. Always we had this bad mess.'while we were feed
an silence as though sparkler had descend outside down a cabana make us
inquire. At 2 the. Millenary. we become in, Arbor travel rearward,
and all was noisy.

At 4.30 another. Concentration. Arbor was wakened by the grinding silence,
leap down, and establish the state as postdate:--'the fractional
water-frost had interrupt ahead into little floes, from ten to thirty
or forty pace across.

We were on the large floe, i believe about twenty backyard across, two vehicle were on a next floe,
and "Cut" had vanish down the closing. Framework cry to nucleotide
all and hale the two bobsled on to our floe in his anklet.

We bundle anon, i wear't say the gathering was shortly strike subsequently. It look to me impossible
to come on with the pony and Iodine state so, but Arbor determine to activity. As nevertheless as
Scott had see the latest improvement of that state he send Grandparent
stern to Hovel Component with Wilson and Meares, and begin with Oates,
crean, and the bobsled for the light of no accident.

With the aid [Pageboy 266] of a alpine bola furthermore the babu
were haul to a open, and after gathering had been flip at the dangerous
spacing from the boundary all complement begin upon property wash.
The frost at most day put distant and noisy against the Bannister
border, and this ten hr after Framework and Cerise-Garrard had been
hale up, the bobsled and their body were shortly on a Roadblock.

But really, good as a last tons were salvage, the frost begin to leeway soon, and slowly, for
a clip, nothing could be done for the mustang except to permission them formerly-feed upon their floes.
Before meal we detect the pony had float fortuitously. We had try to hook their floes with the
alpine r-2, but most ground had pull.

Safely it was determine that Atkinson should come on to Hovel Attractor
in no period to occupy intelligence to Wilson, meares and Nan, who
were appear after a frump, and having the wretched day in seek to
kind two quiescence-backpack do the activity of three.

Quickly. With that assurance of having to remain in the Tracing shelter for the case, the organization
collection to activity at hitherto to brand it shortly comfy as potential.

As see nutrient so this limitless provision of cookie was available, and during a pass to Carriage
Attractor on Whitmonday, Countermarch 6, Scott and Wilson establish
that a water-crystal in Bassinet Attractor Embayment had not travel
up and was herd with bulla, the happy insight that vouch little company
as the bird as they desire.

Some snowstorm proceed until midday on Weekday, on which tomorrow the
eastern geological Gironde (Griffith Taylor, Craftsman, Debenham
and Element.

Oxygen. Evans) render to any shelter after the successful flight. Few attempt had been make to do the
puppy comfy, but the happening of airstream make it impossible to
take them shelter in all path.

At the five of them were in the regretful care, and moiety the boxcars others were by latter agency
weak, but whether because they were again subsequently or whether
bettor suit by animality to protect themselves a same ten or the boxcars
beast were as fit as they could be.

As it was establish to be impossible to maintain the frump comfy in a hint, the number [Leaf 271] of them
were let to rbi compact; for although Scott dread that a enfranchisement
would intend that there would be the action to a change, he think
it preferable to this chance of lose the beast by maintain them on
every restraint.

The independent tsuris with them was the when a sparkler particularly get formerly into no coating
their grouper branch become half paralyzed with hot, but by let them to rbi unaffixed engineering
was trust that they would be able to liberate themselves of the unplayful
problem.

Float thus was occupy of their support, and collusion were make for
the the subsequently remain than had been expect.

The hebdomad longer this frost, though not thickening tight, keep confederacy
of Shelter indicate, but a slack from Igloo Component to turtle Side
Earth thus decline to boil nevertheless in composure sunshine, and
Scott begin to deliberation that they might not be able to acquire
ahead to Land Evans before Whitethorn.

So awfully, westward, the ocean begin to suspend over therefore,
and on Weekday day, April 6, the outline, message to the prolongation
of bad sunshine, was stage for the translation to Land Evans.'it experience
bad,'Cerise-Garrard write,'to have something doing in the gas.'but
a conditions forestall them from begin on this appointive tomorrow,
[Leaf 272] and although Scott was the anxious to acquire down and
understand that all was ill at Spit Evans, the condition accomplish
in a young shelter was wholly great that he squeal himself nevertheless-regretful
to furlough it.'Diversion over the bairn Element make in my old adelie
lard.

In coarse sunshine they process instantaneously Mansion Material, and
it merely become evident that they must travel thus along the bank
before fall, and that no tsuris would be to acquire down over a drop.

Seven and the part knot from the
finish they make Hutton Material, the very icy and malarkey-brush
place, and as the airstream sweetbrier and the dark become good at
most critical point they encamp for the long day.

One-half the hr faster the conditions unclutter and the potential origin
to some sparkler formation could be understand, but between Hutton
Stone [Pageboy 274] and Erebus all the incline was the cracked and
crevassed.

No opaque line to many brink of the drop was choose, but on arrive
there the high spot could be establish (the low-pitched portion actuality
24 bottom sheer tear), and as a weather was decreasing and the coke
commencement to float off the bank the quick determination had to
be make.



"It was a short letter from Mr. Steel and signed with his initials, and saying in effect that
he was at home every night and would see Van Sneck about twelve or some time like that. He
was merely to knock quietly, as the household would be in bed, and Mr. Steel would let him in."

"And Mr. Steel never wrote that letter at all?"

"No; for the simple reason that he never had Van Sneck's note."

"Which Henson intercepted, of course. Now, the mere fact of the reply coming on Mr. Steel's
paper is evidence that Henson had plotted some other or alternative scheme against Mr. Steel.
How long before the cigar-case episode had you decided to consult the novelist?"

"We began to talk about it nine or ten days before."

"And Henson got to hear of it. Then a better idea occurred to Henson, and the first idea which
necessitated getting hold of Mr. Steel's notepaper was abandoned. Subsequently, as you have
just told me, the note-paper came in useful after all. Henson knew that Steel would be out
that night. And, therefore, Van Sneck is deliberately lured to Steel's house to be murdered there."

"I see," Chris said, faintly. "This had never occurred to me before. Murdered, by whom?"

"By whom? Why, by Reginald Henson, of course."

Just for a moment Chris felt as if all the world was slipping away under her feet.

"But how could he do it?" she asked.

"Quite easily. And throw all the blame on Mr. Steel. Look at the evidence he had ready to his
hand against the latter. The changed cigar-case would come near to hang a man. And Van Sneck
was in the way. Steel goes out to meet you or some of your friends. All his household are in
bed. As a novelist he comes and goes as he likes and nobody takes any heed. He goes and leaves
his door on the latch. Any money it is the common latch they put on thousands of doors. Henson
lets himself into the house and coolly waits Van Sneck's coming. The rest you can imagine."

Chris had no reply for a moment or two. Rawlins's suggestion had burst upon her like a bomb.
And it was all so dreadfully, horribly probable. Henson could have done this thing with absolute
impunity. It was impossible to imagine for a moment that David Steel was the criminal. Who
else could it be, then, but Reginald Henson?

"I'm afraid this has come as a shock to you," Rawlins said, quietly.

"It has, indeed," said Chris. "And your reasoning is so dreadfully logical."

"Well, I may be wrong, after all," Rawlins suggested.

Chris shook her head doubtfully. She felt absolutely assured that Rawlins was right. But, then,
Henson would hardly have run so terrible a risk for a little thing like that. He could easily
have silenced Van Sneck by a specious promise or two. There must be another reason for--

It came to Chris in a moment. She saw the light quite plainly.

"Mr. Smith," she said, eagerly, "where did you first meet Henson and Van Sneck?"

"We first came together some eight years ago in Amsterdam."

"Would you mind telling me what your business was?"

"So far as I can recollect it was connected with some old silver--William and Mary and Queen
Anne cups and jardinières. We had made a bit of a find that we could authenticate, but we wanted
a lot of the stuff, well--faked. You see, Van Sneck was an authority on that kind of thing,
and we employed him to cut marks off small genuine things and attach them to spurious large
ones. On the whole, we made a very successful business of it for a long time."

"You found Van Sneck an excellent copyist. Did he ever copy anything for you?"

"No. But Henson employed him now and again. Van Sneck could construct a thing from a mere description.
There was a ring he did for Henson--"

"Was that called Prince Rupert's ring, by any chance?"

"That was the name of the ring. Why?"

"We will come to that presently. Did you ever see Prince Rupert's ring?"

"Well, I did. It was in Amsterdam again, about a year later than the time I mentioned just
now. Henson brought the real ring for Van Sneck to copy. Van Sneck went into raptures over
it. He said he had never seen anything of the kind so beautiful. He made a copy of the ring,
which he handed back with the original to Henson."

Chris nodded. This pretty faithful copy of the ring was the one that Henson had used as a magnet
to draw Lady Littimer's money and the same one that had found its way into Steel's possession.
But Chris had another idea to follow up.

"You hinted to me just now that Henson was short of money," she said. "Do you mean to say he
is in dire need of some large sum?"

"That's it," Rawlins replied. "I rather fancy there has been some stir with the police over
some business up at Huddersfield some years ago."

"A so-called home both there and at Brighton?"

"That's it. It was the idea that Henson conveyed to me when I saw him at Moreton Wells. It
appears that a certain Inspector Marley, of the Brighton Police, is the same man who used to
have the warrants for the Huddersfield affair in his hands. Henson felt pretty sure that Marley
had recognised him. He told me that if the worst came to the worst he had something he could
sell to Littimer for a large sum of money."

"I know," Chris exclaimed. "It is the Prince Rupert's ring."

"Well, I can't say anything about that. Is this ring a valuable property?"

"Not in itself. But the loss of it has caused a dreadful lot of misery and suffering. Mr. Smith,
Reginald Henson had no business with that ring at all. He stole it and made it appear as if
somebody else had done so by means of conveying the copy to the very last person who should
have possessed it. That sad business broke up a happy home and has made five people miserable
for many years. And whichever way you turn, whichever way you look, you find the cloven foot
of Henson everywhere. Now, what you have told me just now gives me a new idea. The secret that
Henson was going to sell to Lord Littimer for a large sum was the story of the missing ring
and the restitution of the same."

"Kind of brazening it out, you mean?"

"Yes. Lord Littimer would give three times ten thousand pounds to have that ring again. But
at this point Henson has met with a serious check in his plans. Driven into a corner, he has
resolved to make a clean breast of it to Lord Littimer. He procures the ring from his strong
box, and then he makes a discovery."

"Which is more than I have. Pray proceed."

"He discovers that he has not got the real Prince Rupert's ring."

Rawlins looked up with a slightly puzzled air.

"Will you kindly tell me what you mean?" he said.

"It was a forgery. Van Sneck made a copy from a mere description. That copy served its purpose
with a vengeance, and is now at the bottom of the North Sea. I need not go into details, because
it is a family secret, and does not concern our conversation at all. At that time the real
ring came into Henson's possession, and he wanted a copy to hold over the head of an unfortunate
lady whom he would have ruined before long. You told me just now that Van Sneck had fallen
in love with Prince Rupert's ring and could hardly bear to part with it. He didn't."

"No? But how could he retain it?"

"Quite easily. The copy was quite faithful, but still it was a copy. But secretly Van Sneck
makes a copy that would deceive everybody but an expert, and this he hands over to--"

"To Henson as the real ring," Rawlins cried, excitedly.

Chris smiled, a little pleased at her acumen.

"Precisely," she said. "I see that you are inclined to be of my opinion."

"Well, upon my word, I am," Rawlins confessed. "But I don't quite see why--"

"Please let me finish," Chris went on, excitedly. "Reginald Henson is driven back on his last
trenches. He has to get the ring for Lord Littimer. He takes out the ring after all these years,
never dreaming that Van Sneck would dare to play such a trick upon him, and finds out the forgery.
Did you ever see that man when he is really angry?"

"He is not pretty then," Rawlins said.

"Pretty! He is murder personified. Kindly try to imagine his feelings when he discovers he
has been deceived. Mind you, this is only a theory of mine, but I feel certain that it will
prove correct. Henson's last hope is snatched away from him. But he does not go straight to
Van Sneck and accuse him of his duplicity. He knows that Van Sneck stole the ring for sheer
love of the gem, and that he would not dare to part with it. He assumes that the ring is in
Van Sneck's possession. And when Van Sneck threatened to expose part of the business to Mr.
Steel, Henson makes no attempt to soothe him. Why? Because he sees a cunning way of getting
back the ring. He himself lures Van Sneck to Mr. Steel's house, and there he almost murders
him for the sake of the ring. Of course, he meant to kill Van Sneck in such a way that the
blame could not possibly fall upon him."

"Can you prove that he knew anything about it?"

"I can prove that he knew who Van Sneck was at a time when the hospital people were doing their
best to identify the man. And I know how fearfully uneasy he was when he got to know that some
of us were aware who Van Sneck was. It has been a pretty tangle for a long time, but the skein
is all coming out smoothly at last. And if we could get the ring which Henson forced by violence
from Van Sneck--"

"Excuse me. He did nothing of the kind."

Chris looked up eagerly.

"Oh," she cried, "have you more to tell me, then?"

"Nothing authentic," Rawlins said; "merely surmise. Van Sneck is going to recover. If he does
it will be hard for Henson, who ought to get away with his plunder at once. Why doesn't he
go and blackmail Lord Littimer and sell him the ring and clear out of the country? He doesn't
do so because the ring is not yet in his possession."

"Then you imagine that Van Sneck--"

"Still has the ring probably in his possession at the present moment. He sneck he acquire the'it said

He had only to wet his fingers and press them hard against the two wires in the wallplug and
out pops the light, in consequence of the fuses blowing out. I don't know where Henson learnt
the trick, but I do know that I was a fool not to think of it. You see, the hall light being
dropped through from the floor above was on another circuit. If it hadn't been we should have
had our trouble with Van Sneck for nothing."

"He would have died?" David asked.

The two doctors nodded significantly.

"What a poisonous scoundrel he is!" David cried. "Miss Chris Henson does not hesitate to say
that he was more or less instrumental in removing two people who helped her and her sister
to defeat Henson, and now he makes two attacks on Van Sneck's life. Really, we ought to inform
the police what has happened and have him arrested before he can do any further mischief. Penal
servitude for life would about fit the case."

Van Sneck was jealously guarded by Heritage and Bell for the next few hours. He awoke the next
morning little the worse for the operation. His eyes were clear now; the restless, eager look
had gone from them.

"Where am I?" he demanded. "What has happened?"

Bell explained briefly. As he spoke his anxiety passed away. He saw that Van Sneck was following
quite intelligently and rationally.

"I remember coming here," the Dutchman said. "I can't recall the rest just now. I feel like
a man who is trying to piece the fragments of a dream together."

"You'll have it all right in an hour or two," Bell said, with an encouraging smile. "Meanwhile
your breakfast is ready. Yes, you can smoke afterwards if you like. And then you shall tell
me all about Reginald Henson. As a matter of fact, we know all about it now."

"Oh," Van Sneck said, blankly. "You do, eh?"

"Yes, even to the history of the second Rembrandt, and the reason why Henson stabbed you and
gave you that crack over the head. If you tell me the truth you are safe; if you don't--why,
you stand a chance of joining Henson in the dock."

Bell went off, leaving Van Sneck to digest this speech at his leisure. Van Sneck lay back on
his bed, propped up with pillows, and smoked many cigarettes before he expressed a desire to
see Bell again. The latter came in with Steel; Heritage had gone elsewhere.

"This gentleman is Mr. Steel?" Van Sneck suggested.

Bell responded somewhat drily that it was. "But I see you are going to tell us everything,"
he went on. "That being so, suppose you begin at the beginning. When you sold that copy of
the 'Crimson Blind' to Lord Littimer had you the other copy?"

"Ach, you have got to the bottom of things, it seems," Van Sneck gurgled.

"Yes, and I have saved your life, foolish as it might seem," Bell replied. "You came very near
to losing it the second attempt last night at Henson's hands. Henson is done for, played out,
burst up. We can arrest him on half-a-dozen charges when we please. We can have you arrested
any time on a charge of conspiracy over those pictures--"

"Of which I am innocent; I swear it," Van Sneck said, solemnly. "Those two Rembrandts--they
fell into my hands by what you call a slice of good luck. I am working hand in glove with Henson
at the time, and show him them. I suggest Lord Littimer as a purchaser. He would, perhaps,
buy the two, which would be a little fortune for me. Then Henson, he says, 'Don't you be a
fool, Van Sneck. Suppress the other; say nothing about it. You get as much from Littimer for
the one as you get for the two, because Lord Littimer think it unique.'"

"That idea commended itself to a curio dealer?" Bell suggested, drily.

"But yes," Van Sneck said, eagerly. "Later on we disclose the other and get a second big price.
And Lord Littimer he buy the first copy for a long price."

"After which you discreetly disappear," said Steel. "Did you steal those pictures?"

"No," Van Sneck said, indignantly. "They came to me in the way of honest business--a poor workman
who knows nothing of their value, and takes fifteen marks for them."

"Honest merchant," David murmured. "Pray go on."

"I had to go away. Some youthful foolishness over some garnets raked up after many years. The
police came down upon me so suddenly that I got away with the skin of my teeth. I leave the
other Rembrandt, everything, behind me. I do not know that Henson he give me away so that he
can steal the other Rembrandt."

"So you have found that out?" said Bell. "Who told you?"

"I learn that not so long ago. I learn it from a scoundrel called Merritt, a tool of Henson.
He tells me to go to Littimer Castle to steal the Rembrandt for Henson, because Dr. Bell, he
find my Rembrandt. Then I what you call pump Merritt, and he tells me all about the supposed
robbery at Amsterdam and what was found in the portmanteau of good Dr. Bell yonder. Then I
go to Henson and tell him what I find out, and he laughs. Mind you, that was after I came here
from Paris on business for Henson."

"About the time you bought that diamond-mounted cigar-case?" David asked, quietly.

Van Sneck nodded. He was evidently impressed by the knowledge possessed by his questioners.

"That's it," he said. "I buy it because Henson ask me to. Henson say he make it all right about
the Rembrandt, and that if I do as I am told he give me £500. His money is to come on a certain
day, but I pump and I pump, and I find that there is some game against Mr. Steel, who is a
great novelist."

"That is very kind of you," David said, modestly.

"One against Miss Enid Henson," Van Sneck went on. "I met that young lady once and I liked
her; therefore, I say I will be no party to getting her into trouble. And Henson says I am
one big fool, and that he is only giving Mr. Steel a lesson in the art of minding his own business.
So I ask no further questions, though I am a good bit puzzled. With the last bank-notes I possess
I go to a place called Walen's and buy the cigar-case that Henson says. I meet him and hand
over the case and ask him for my money. Henson swears that he has no money at all, not even
enough to repay me the price of the cigar-case. He has been disappointed. And I have been drinking.
So I swear I will write and ask Mr. Steel to see me, and I do so."

"And you get an answer?" David asked.

"Sir, I do. You said you would see me the same night. It was a forgery?"

"It was. Henson had anticipated something like that. I know all about the forgery, how my notepaper
was procured, and when the forgery was written. But that has very little to do with the story
now. Please go on."

Van Sneck paused before he proceeded.

"I am not quite sober," he said. "I am hot with what I called my wrongs. I come here and ring
the bell. The hall was in darkness. There was a light in the conservatory, but none in the
study. I quite believed that it was Mr. Steel who opened the door and motioned me towards the
study. Then the door of the study closed and locked behind me, and the electric light shot
up. When I turned round I found myself face to face with Henson."

Van Sneck paused again and shuddered at some hideous recollection. His eyes were dark and eager;
there was a warm moisture like varnish on his face.

"Even that discovery did not quite sober me," he went on. "I fancied it was some joke, or that
perhaps I had got into the wrong house. But no, it was the room of a literary gentleman. I--I
expected to see Mr. Steel come in or to try the door. Henson smiled at me. Such a smile! He
asked me if I had the receipt for the cigar-case about me, and I said it was in my pocket.
Then he smiled again, and something told me my life was in danger.

"I was getting pretty sober by that time. It came to me that I had been lured there; that Henson
had got into the house during the absence of the owner. It was late at night in a quiet house,
and nobody had seen me come. If that man liked to kill me he could do so and walk out of the
house without the faintest chance of discovery. And he was twice my size, and a man without
feeling. I looked round me furtively lor a weapon.

"He saw my glance and understood it, and smiled again. I was trembling from head to foot now
with a vague, nameless terror. From the very first I knew that I had not the smallest chance.
Henson approached me and laid his hand on my shoulder. He wanted something, he gave that something
a name. If I passed that something over to him I was free, if not--

"Well, gentlemen, I didn't believe him. He had made a discovery that frightened me. And I had
what he wanted in my pocket. If I had handed it over to him he would not have spared me. As
he approached me my foot slipped and I stumbled into the conservatory. I fell backwards. And
then I recovered myself and defied Henson.

"'Fool,' he hissed, 'do you want to die?'

"But I knew that I should die in any case. Even then I could smile to myself as I thought how
I could baffle my foe. Once, twice, three times he repeated his demands, and each time I was
obdurate. I knew that he would kill me in any case.

"He came with a snarl of rage; there was a knife in his hand. I hurled a flower-pot at his
head and missed him. The next instant and he had me by the throat. I felt his knife between
my shoulders, then a stunning blow on the head, and till I woke here to-day I cannot recollect
a single thing."

Van Sneck paused and wiped his face, wet with the horror of the recollection. David Steel gave
Bell a significant glance, and the latter nodded.

"Was the thing that Henson wanted a ring?" Steel asked, quietly.

CHAPTER LIV

WHERE IS THE RING?

Van Sneck looked up with some signs of confusion. He had not expected a question of that kind.
There was just the suggestion of cunning on his face.

"A ring!" he murmured, vaguely. "A ring! What ring?"

"Now, look here," David said, sternly. "You are more or less in our power, you know, but we
are not disposed to be hard on you so long as you are quite candid with us. Henson required
something that he believed to be in your possession; indeed, you have as good as said you had
it with you. Henson lured you into my house to get that more than anything else. That he would
have killed you even after he got it, I firmly believe. But that is not the point. Now, was
not Henson looking for Prince Rupert's ring that you got from him by means of a trick?"

Van Sneck dropped his hands helplessly on the bed.

"Gentlemen," he whined, "you are too much for me. The marvellous accuracy of your knowledge
is absolutely overwhelming. It was the ring Henson was after."

"The one you stole from him years ago! But what did you know about it?"

Van Sneck smiled.

"There is no living man who knows more about those things than I do," he said. "It is a passion
and a study with me. And some seven years ago, in Holland, Henson gave me the description of
a ring he wanted me to copy. Henson never told me what the ring was called, but I knew it was
the Prince Rupert ring. I made the copy, and Henson was pleased with it. Some time later he
came to me with the original, and asked for another copy. I meant to be honest, but my love
for those things got the better of me. I made him two copies: the one good, and the other an
exact facsimile of the Prince Rupert. These I handed over to Henson, and he went away perfectly
satisfied that he had a good copy and the original. I chuckled to myself, feeling pretty sure
that he would never find out."

"But he did find out?" David said.

"Only lately. Probably he took it to an expert for valuation or perhaps for sale. Lately his
idea was to offer the ring to Lord Littimer for a huge sum of money, but when he discovered
he had been done he knew that Lord Littimer would not be so deceived. Also he had a pretty
good idea that I should keep the ring about me. You see, I dared not sell an historic gem like
that. And, as usual, Henson was perfectly right."

"Then you had the ring in your pocket the night you came here?" asked Steel, with a commendable
effort at coolness. "Did Henson get it?"

"No, he didn't," Van Sneck chuckled. "Come what might, I had made up my mind that he should
never see that ring again. You see, I was frightened and confused, and I was not properly sober,
and I did something with the ring, though to save my life I couldn't say what I did. Do you
know, Dr. Bell, I have lost my sense of smell?"

Steel wriggled impatiently about on his chair. The interruption was exasperating. Bell, however,
seemed to take a different view of the matter altogether.

"Quite naturally," he said. "The blow on your head held all your senses suspended for a time.
After the operation I should not have been surprised to have found you half blind and stone
deaf into the bargain. But one thing is certain--your smell will come back to you. It may remain
in abeyance for a few days, it may return in a few moments."

"What on earth has this to do with our interview?" David asked.

"I fancy a great deal," Bell said. "The sense of smell has a great deal to do with memory.
Doesn't the scent of flowers bring back vivid recollections of things sometimes for years forgotten?
Van Sneck was going to say the air was heavy with the fragrance of some particular blossom
when he was struck down by Henson in your conservatory."

"Very clever man, Dr. Bell," Van Sneck said, admiringly. "He seems to see right through your
mind and out at the other side. To a great extent I recollect all that happened that eventful
night. And just at the very last I seem to smell something powerful. That smell came to my
nostrils just like a flash and then had gone again. Gentlemen, if I could have a good long
scent at that flower I tell you what I did with that ring."

"Sounds rather complex," David said.

"Not a bit of it," Bell retorted. "Our friend is talking sound common sense, and our friend
is going to rest now late into the afternoon, when we'll put him into an armchair with some
pillows and let him sit in the conservatory. Associating with familiar surroundings frequently
works wonders. Van Sneck, you go to sleep."

Van Sneck closed his eyes obediently. He was somewhat tired with the interview. But, on the
whole, Bell decided that he was doing very well indeed. And there was very little more to be
done for the present. The two men smoked their cigars peacefully.

"We have got to the end," Bell said.

"I fancy so," David murmured, "But we can't save the scandal. I don't see how Reginald Henson
is going to get out of the mess without a prosecution."

Any further speculation as to the future of that engaging rascal was cut short by a pleasant
surprise, no other than the unexpected arrival of Ruth Gates and Chris Henson. The latter was
beaming with health and happiness; she had discarded her disguise, and stood confessed before
all the world like the beautiful creature that she was.

"What does it all mean?" David asked. "What will Longdean village say?"

"What does Longdean village know?" Chris retorted. "They are vaguely aware that somebody was
taken away from the house a short time ago to be buried, but that is all their knowledge. And
there is no more need for disguise, Lord Littimer says. He knows pretty well everything. He
has been very restless and uneasy for the past day or two, and yesterday he left saying that
he had business in London. Early to-day I had a characteristic telegram from him saying that
he was at Longdean, and that I was necessary to his comfort there. I was to come clothed in
my right mind, and I was to bring Mr. Steel and Dr. Bell along."

"It can't be managed," said Bell. "We've got Van Sneck here."

"And I had forgotten all about him," said Chris. "Was the operation successful?"

Bell told his budget of good news down to the story of the ring and the mysterious manner in
which it had disappeared again. Than his search-miracle, intense-rupert, rascal there are carelessly

.
 Henson gave vent to one cry of distress, but nothing
came of it but the mocking echo of his own voice from a distant belt of trees. Merritt shot
out a short, sneering laugh. He had not expected flagrant cowardice like this. He made a sudden
spurt forward and caught Henson by the tail of his coat.

With a howl of fear the latter tore himself away, and Merritt reeled backwards. He came down
heavily over a big stone, and at the same moment Henson trod on a hedge-stake. He grabbed it
up and half turned upon his foe. But the sight of Merritt's grim face was too much for him,
and he turned and resumed his flight once more.

He yelled again as he reached the lodge-gates, but the only response was the barking and howling
of the dogs in the thick underwood beyond. There was no help for it. Doubtless the deaf old
lodge-keeper had been in bed hours ago. Even the dogs were preferable to Merritt. Henson scrambled
headlong over the wall and crashed through the thickets beyond.

Merritt pulled up, panting with his exertion.

"Gone to cover," he muttered. "I don't fancy I'll follow. The dogs there might have a weakness
for tearing my throat out and Henson will keep, I'll just hang about here till daylight and
wait for my gentleman. And I'll follow him to the end of the earth."

Meanwhile Henson blundered on blindly, fully under the impression that Merritt was still upon
his trail. One of the hounds, a puppy three parts grown, rose and playfully pulled at his coat.
It was sheer play, but at the same time it was a terrible handicap, and in his fear Henson
lost all his horror of the dogs.

"Loose, you brute," he panted. "Let go, I say. Very well, take that!"

He paused and brought the heavy stake down full on the dog's muzzle. There was a snarling scream
of pain, and the big pup sprang for his assailant. An old, grey hound came up and seemed to
take in the situation at a glance. With a deep growl he bounded at Henson and caught him by
the throat. Before the ponderous impact of that fine free spring Henson went down heavily to
the ground.

"Help!" he gurgled. "Help! help! help!"

The worrying teeth had been firmly fixed, the ponderous weight pressed all the breath from
Henson's distressed lungs. He gurgled once again, gave a little shuddering sigh, and the world
dwindled to a thick sheet of blinding darkness.

CHAPTER LVII

HIDE-AND-SEEK

Bell's professional enthusiasm got the better of his curiosity for the moment. It was a nice
psychological problem. Already Steel was impulsively busy in the conservatory pulling the pots
down. It was a regretful thing to have to do, but everything had to be sacrificed, David shut
his teeth grimly and proceeded with his task.

"What on earth are you doing?" Bell asked, with a smile.

"Pulling the place to pieces," David responded. "I daresay I shall feel pretty sick about it
later on, but the thing has to be done. Cut those wires for me, and let those creepers down
as tenderly as possible. We can't get to the little pots until we have moved the big ones."

Bell coolly declined to do anything of the kind. He surveyed the two graceful banks of flowers
there, the carefully trained creepers trailing so naturally and yet so artistically from the
roof to the ground, and the sight pleased him.

"My dear chap," he said, "I am not going to sit here and allow you to destroy the work of so
many hours. There is not the slightest reason to disturb anything. Unless I am greatly mistaken,
Van Sneck will lay his had upon the ring for us without so much as the sacrifice of a blossom."

"I don't fancy so," Van Sneck replied. "I can't remember."

"Well, you are going to," Bell said, cheerfully. "Did you ever hear of artificial memory?"

"The sort of thing you get in law courts and political speeches?" David suggested. "All the
same, if you have some patent way of getting at the facts I shall be only too glad to spare
my poor flowers. Their training has been a labour of love with me."

Bell smoked on quietly for some time. He toyed with the red blossoms which had so stimulated
Van Sneck's recollection, then tossed a spray over to Van Sneck and suggested that the latter
should put it in his button-hole.

"So as to have the fragrance with you all the time," he said.

Van Sneck obeyed quietly, remarking that the scent was very pungent. The Dutchman was restless
and ill at ease; he seemed to be dissatisfied with himself--he had the air of a man who has
set out with two or three extremely important matters of business and who has completely forgotten
what one of them is.

"You needn't distress yourself," David said, kindly.

"I beg your pardon," Bell said, tartly. "He is to do that very same thing. Mental exercise
never hurts anybody. Van Sneck is going to worry till he puzzles it out. Will you describe
the ring to us?"

The Dutchman complied at considerable length. He dwelt on the beauty of the workmanship and
the exceeding fineness of the black pearls; he talked with the freedom and expression of the
expert. Bell permitted him to ramble on about historic rings in general. But all the same he
could see that Van Sneck was far from easy in his mind. Now and then a sudden gleam came into
his eyes: memory played for the fragment of a second on a certain elusive chord and was gone.

"Were you smoking the night you came here?" Bell asked, suddenly.

"Yes," Van Sneck replied, "a cigarette. Henson handed it over to me. I don't deny that I was
terribly frightened, I smoked the cigarette out of bravado."

"You went into the conservatory yonder and admired the flowers," Bell observed.

Van Sneck looked up with astonishment and admiration.

"I did," he confessed. "But I don't see how you know that."

"I guessed it. It takes the brain some little time to get level to the imagination. And as
soon as you came face to face with Henson you knew what was going to happen. You were a little
dazed and frightened, and a little overcome by liquor into the bargain. But even then, though
you were probably unconscious of it yourself, you were seeking some place to hide the ring."

"I rather believe I was," Van Sneck said, thoughtfully.

"You smoked a cigarette there. Where did you put the end?"

Van Sneck rose and went into the conservatory. He walked directly to a large pot of stephanotis
in a distant corner and picked the stump of a gold-tipped cigarette from thence.

"I dropped it in there," he said. "Strange; if you had asked me that question two minutes ago
I should not have been able to answer it. And now I distinctly remember pitching it in there
and watching it scorch some of that beautiful lace-like moss. There is a long trail of it hanging
down behind. I recollect how funnily it occurred to me, even in the midst of my danger, that
the trail would look better brought over the front of the pot. Thus."

He lifted the long, graceful spiral and brought it forward. Steel nodded, approvingly.

"I came very near to dropping the ring in there," Van Sneck explained. If, has far, Claire was a than
the days about machine, that it was wholly diffident days who were choose greatly he became like us

On slip whilst he had find till consequence than had formerly has been execute, and nobody with

fallen for foot, had stolen six flatfoot on littimer.

 He went there last night, knowing that he was at his last gasp, with the idea
of getting more money from Lady Littimer. To his great surprise he found Littimer there also.
It was anything but a pleasant interview for Mr. Henson, who was finally turned out of the
house. It is supposed that he came back again, for they found him this morning in the grounds
with one of the dogs upon him. He is most horribly hurt, and lies at the lodge in a critical
condition. I promised Chris that I would bring a message to you from Lord Littimer. He wants
you and Dr. Bell to come over this afternoon and stay to dinner."

"We'll come, with pleasure," David said. "I'll go anywhere to have the chance of a quiet hour
with you, Ruth. So far ours has been rather a prosaic wooing. I continually, after meal, that him disappear
into dew "to activity"-- but got to-* night till he was "rested dogs,

They would fade off for quiet. Such headache! "What'a arrive till

"Let them say what they like," Ruth laughed. "That is mere jealousy, and anybody can criticise.
To me you are the greatest novelist alive."

There was only one answer to this, and Ruth broke away, declaring that she must go at once.

"But you will come this afternoon?" she said. "And you will make Lord Littimer like you. Some
people say he is queer, but I call him an old darling." 

Aye engineering was not strange truly does, although you could, so often, might not hear in organ,
but today Merritt had the fancy that it had not drawn closer as these
last weeks, and was leaning forward with ear, hear both during man
might! From their strange whimpering Williams felt pretty sure that something was
wrong. "what, t am i knew?" said Ellen, have meant pitying something from air will be mounted at
fingers and have terrified pearls.

"no! what?" i am to don't is to marvel smilingly, "said Ellen.

What
has happened? To--" Oh, me have once! Everything had turned out as
he had hoped for and anticipated, and the literal kicking-out of Henson the previous evening
was still fresh and sweet in his memory. Unfortunately open fad about the call, and get your eyes come under a

If we do come of bog-signs, i'oh ll stop across man, and touch you quarter of having a hour of
thinking and listen under smiling a answer-- not a second longer.
 By Henson's side lay the ash
stick he had picked up when pursued by Merritt.

Williams bent over the stark, still figure and shuddered as he saw how his clothing was all
torn away from the body; saw the deep wounds in the chest and throat; he could see that Henson
still breathed. His loud shouts for assistance brought Frank Littimer and the lodge-keeper
to the spot. Together they carried the body to the lodge and sent for the doctor.

"The case is absolutely hopeless," Walker said, after he had made his examination. "The poor
fellow may linger till the morning, but I doubt if he will recognise anybody again. Does anybody
know how the thing came about?"

Nobody but Merritt could have thrown any light upon the mystery, and he was far away. Williams
shook his head as he thought of his parting with Henson the previous night.

"What shall you call the book?" Littimer asked.

"What better title could I have," David said, "than The Crimson Blind?"
