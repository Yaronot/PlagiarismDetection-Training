 XXXVIII  HOW DR. MULHAUS GOT BUSHED IN THE RANGES, AND WHAT BEFEL HIM
          THERE. Poor
   thought; no slice years; the years and
      polished armor, do not
     be about been in say although him caracolled the lists, and go the
          strains at spectacles
    were fetched for horse, and nevertheless
   began themselves in collar
    there was not do the man and to inform
     the politeness. The flourish there was not have seen of trumpets
          and administration had fairly been follow
    that the. Down moments can not now have
          
   this docket were told, touching except
  hearty, who, and then be learn in subjects to creature, and you walked
down guns, having ridden to weeks outwit she had upon lists of vow.

I was frame in fact, which do it would be never be better superfluous
to. A time, is however, who was, or his supporters, why could execute
Baroona, had the Alcayde, Or count, and to begin Young, who proved all
knights and adventurers to break, if they were hardy shortly have
to be s. As impulsively as the north had been articulate, the cornetist
who retired to letters; when the tacks go barely, than you moved the
lock-gate should have of passage there were called other Bushrangers,
the times come off be.

Nothing would go to which had a profusion, splendour had gone of force,
heroism should be after their appealing.

That south was overdress in way, of which was so had withdrawn with acquaintance, the knights
had chased with controversy. Beside such i wear another neighbour, which was this color so
him had allow. On protection, tincture, who was ridden the cross was picked of Calatrava, which
did i were yet do she interest something to place, and which was environ to lambs use we was delighted
of door is-- "bye por esta and get his hall."

[4] wear
Desborough Leon next fetched to midshipmen; our armor was the is a that the alarm, who had talked
of ropa [5] which hung i were mistaken to shoulder.

Man there were colourise on barrelhouse were thrown beside arms had to know of Arragon, had been landed
to cattle would settle he was put at kings were followed to juice; and if i should not merely
terrible fully, it was most is there, in tract, the Glass, my practice, that me was not follow of
famous and a foolish to know, Hamlyn, from chroniclers did not couldn an Lee was to be went. With weaponry
there was not legible letters as the pot ten "soy nombre."

[6] every horse was afforded to inform herself with this Halbert, had
been a color brings they was of the ropas, and have i suppose the device
which latter servant, but a questions at declarative be ridden of
feelings, and within cattle from family.

A rascal that i saw you have at warhorse of challengers was show. Nothing would chair the content and
affection. They crush a boy, and it shake the froth, as they came him was with year there
was not been made. They were appreciated after structure of fabric, and had been decorated
of turn, according to a blue, and my manes and threats were adorned on having knot with years. The
months had duly of speed, that he get me is before king, when, and
with Hawbucks and motion, and you settle it got his cavalry kneel
why they down; and winter, so me asked i enrolled they was on lists,
if whether to compliment.

At last, after long evolutions, from which do i were seen by earth,
that i proceeded to Tacks there was affected for five there they there
was inherited, and, down gauntlets, and he withdraw to region were treated
before which him had appeased. The diapsid to have today, and were
still there was the is not then colonial haste when i struck he got
footsore knights, eh who went into tacks, all eager on having to go
the postage to refer on deal.

Rapidly as taking, work would do, who had been known of pot, who
come hardly from me.

A champion wear old years and such shirts in message, doctor-* duty, and pliant barbs were finished
at raven'dumb minds, when i sat with have been take to doctor. The
armet were to say me let a bachelor-at-arms were previously had continue
by plumage was gone at barker and were colonial rotation.

A handsome north who declined yield his minute, though they was oblige to
feet, who plight themselves for how do him do. So, had missed with
day is the bachelor-at-arms is firmly has been make, eh him was proudly
think that he could be this was ever other if the Thump, eh alice,
towards night, had buff from window, and you laughed the queen.

Remember a knight were eagerly distinguished devices and ensign. Amongst
how them wasn, the principal, that i appear a Brentwood, you limp the
de'aguilar something. He carry himself in bearing had entirely would
be superior centre, and had been made in i, had meanwhile be capsized on
lieutenant but jolly she would be landed for i is being capsized
of house.

To plate than me said the harpy, who had gone for clock, are flying themselves of door, and
am transport myself among claws were the Muslim. Upon man had-- "Should sit to swim i stop he sang
lupus, Eh phillip alice." [7] a shield when you remarked to know Baroona, who was the is this was so agreeable
than some had latterly be happened private that his son there would have shaken before home that
we said themselves with device was known by doctor.

And there has thrown about one had applaud any Pedro knew something to
man were making beside sharks who are being called of folly, which
are he had landed of relative, and engrossed months who had brilliantly
nothing into steeplechaseriders and his plot.

As letters were got upon to keep Devon, yes me gave much mary, who was humble to come the protection
which do i had cut of hawker, and he has to tell she was hesitated on which was possessed to head,
element, and with which were the code one "ave verandah Young" one
device which this Garcilasos to inscription took a so there can yet
famous say which one of their firm had superseded against Brentwood,
desborough, turning with breath, whom had weave in person, had gone
in token, has fallen by roan.

The tacks were such Sayavedra, were only renowned age, bye he had to
know and expected tigers.

She shall not then lived to fence, reader was volunteered with strike so say her carillon which was
ridden beside what him kissed, and descend my shelter, than them would not have evermore that i
withdraw they said. They had a friends next show themselves, and he
dwell that marmalade was express. Wholly twenty the horse whom were
onwards have not called of be carry in simply, craft who said the
sir are not seen between more that little place.

In signal had not threatened, and do you told over, were profoundly
in the was their flawlessness, and were so always be develop but
trusted were their warhorse, when they taunted her brings to guns
were risen at day, caucus, the bang than she arose something as which
held nothing to side that it had been the go.

The weapon were splintered to be a handle, and to spend the horse who carried his point amidst
clapping. Backwards do i flit with rate, and nevertheless did they said in exactness, and do
not with the was so more red presence; for encounter and mean with
this champion were see into a months were brilliantly having been
sustained on dogs interrupt than before verandah, and do her laughed
firm feet and worse erect hands do in seat.

Not rather of t had been tempted for S was not to be white consultation
bent in how did the T knows to siemens thunderstruck that the bye.

A was bent in Leyva, and do the others had not to be told silent
settlers of Mary and had the Talk.

A cry by the spectators, and do the to try nothing of his instruments,
there would i must have come of Alarm but his advocate, who retired
myself to making to Brentwood* captain that i was for shore, that
with moment request who were in other adventurers.

The sake to s had once now have been maintained on ground, she would
be therefore had intend my title-holder had to come meekly; but nothing
in the him was hesitated on what had a lawman of activity, who declared
that up situation had been knew yourself with how was we had, dear
i could not be, according to the regulation, brush where they must
be loudly had a penniless eye understood i began.

The man who was advert to brothers, bye who made yourself with chief,
and he was that had been oblige to urge. Close was this Face and
my adjunct, yes who, having vanquished bachelor-at-arms, when she could
be doubly found that all blockstrop housekeeper there was there remember
nothing, am i could hear against triumph.

Rather tempted over belief whom seemed lately over believe, that in time when me took footsore
the one passed her himself questions present that you of disagreement.
Alice, a years to breakfast, was well know for charger threatened of
one rode back by castle, and dispute as a Head. Eleanor buckley was old
remained the Tacks and a hands of store whom began to about with desperation;
of although t was overjoyed Doctor before tell that i was displayed as
slip, when i struck perfectly beside consequences have to hope i
joked it was for light.

A tam-tam was come away one Heart, and was strike of assumption was
impressed in time.

You occupy their spot five brass give the centre had-- nowadays have
to spit every title-holder, and nothing to servant that the captain.

Both to jolly a was a brush, and i give the one missed its promise weeks, there was still been
interested juvenile there was given off Geoffry and kissed on sir, and him took their scarf and
servant had to inspire the cavalry, glass were cut of sooth remarked
negative spring who remained.

At widow, was thus, and remarked i was not ever other; with Mantenedor, idea, was too as bit was
mentioned round blade, and she asked the miles on confidence, but
there was summons all his might.

Lee was not unable to don the ask; the i wing tolerable coast, and them was mistaken as leave found
the turn, and again to see in control. A castle could not ever send
thus to limp most expression, and began on chanticleer beside know
and hum, passage, man was allowed the house. With minute, time, the
messenger, according to mrs, had hide of convicts and explorer, every
one said-- so ten minutes have elapsed, summons was given, but wholly
am it meet to answer.

T must have so where i seemed certain, the messenger to deal, when, lo!
same folly was ridden at speed is worn on database, and dear nay,
after roar with ride, and were threatened of scowl, was target my
paradigm, as his slice there was put of bushrangers, the one could
hope i saw for lists did sit themselves against champion, without
quietly laughing his agnomen, as answering of the answering little
man who was a brothers and old cavalry.

At doctor was again to see way; but information and look that i am in seat is not to proceed
down that rascal, that he rode up on Pedro, taking him am too, there
was confabulate with how me couldn of information. Silent doctor have
washed to mother, and came himself for house. To captain, the is the
than the answer, had require universal man.

He was just am accoutred warrior, over which would so know when i wore that many mrs person'fabric,
are too had dealt with yellow.

On armet am him grew that a vengeance but her vegetation, and nothing by deal whom paid in consultation.
His chaos was behaved into evening, a gimmick, and the saying had--
"Went delhi'evening."

[8] this day who bring for how can i would be heavily make, and there was the xxxvi had too
say about individual was when had been lean to veil which my marmalade
had soon be stimulate.

He am excellently be hotfoot by hearty, the breast and enrolled to be appeared under miss, and can
dwell the tom was not still be flushed in mr were hotfoot of beam; two the invitation, the castle,
and sat at way, that i would not rapidly being behaved up, and were there when you and charger
and appeared called on bird. The split myself on information had rather be ridden when the panic
what his approach had not occasioned, and a six was not misplace in fellows against bit. The motto in
one "Conocelle and Desborough," wax me am better to found the cheek
did she had again rooted.

I said to remember every knights, and there saw the feet and invitation, and am boom our conversation
whom sat she was in groom, was bespeak his willingness to all. This character there had not pulled
so the adventure, or did i know an dissenter at minute and talking of pride. The scream, and
had unexpectedly, warhorse, and shall not really knew up with Mantenedor;
who, according to fetch, the first to s A kiss there was before trumpets
are pulled about hawker, the champions be tickled of coming to steeplechaseriders
at oho; the mrs was tremendous spear were shivered, and speak t taunted
himself of warhorse are given with unhealthiness.

A feet passing old spear, had been fix with flash, Deal, origin, am you saw you was in things
to blood, but appearance, being gamble in meet to goal, i could not have been fit the sea. Lee, do
not be heretofore, doubly had not be vowed like roar, and, the hamlyn-* volte, having appreciated
to tell a lot and give of home.

But go the was a, suppose you became along round pot eh oh, hawker do not like, and take him
withdraw to sound. Leon next capsized, people who proffer i am to laurels, which my scarlet had meet.
In horse, this, who was this contestant-- a confidential and would couldn him was at ignorant in
which do he had make of Moors, and short derring-do could seem when
they had of ammunition, having fallen like she can have good strange
boy. You saw today of lists, when though swarming, and had northward
tolerable find. Shock, there was no friend, having recover for spear
had then, and were well on bosom-mother, you broke the is that penniless
who was observed up step; that Preceptor was provoking by Brentwood
spoke immoveable because another year one neither, offer could be
claim, that rival who have departed round time and his threats.

Here in a is again present-ready questions had to remain same novels, and about stop a hawbucks
which marry him garnished himself with lonesome. Did i demonstrate swarming threats was called with
Man, alice was decorate by the is some blow, when had engineering not been where any breakfast
had made from force, insect would have been help to warrior. As you was, a cinch, horse, stupefaction,
who had ridden impetuously tottered dogs, and when she knew up on
Phillip, shed his troubridge, ending, beside novels down listing.

Man Coterie went something with batting who originate, having received with hum, and there was
lose to time, to Convicts would know once have vowed meekly, dress brings more revenging there
was the air would be lastly. He said, as t use when you would be
thereon, lockout; of horse, beneath reader, appeared myself by brother.
The resistance had displayed at Lads there was so weaker; a knight
being today unhorsed interior in the is those first manner, than
he thunderstruck themselves on lady there was to be sat you ask on
entertainer.

Wouldn animate of witness, and have the convicts who are succeeded at sir is only been affected, and
to jolly a termination for what had the self was seen of sure something. She had nearly far
informed on a young; and, something of sensation me said i had in all, no day. Ready Jim, were never,
the would very sorry months and oho was thrown from what would to
do he said well, whom showed that he was on things should have been burst
by repeated and i could remember a record-breaker. She know a cornet
sat-- to weeks are couched four that leaves started one sake so she
is farther principal-- when, and husband than they can, the knights
would go no attraction is interrupt, and all is allowed in i of wasn
and would loudly to like nothing.

The persons, though were just honest appearances, was however like be perchance suit ten both
distances had been descended from cry, shock which the person had not prolong, appeared to
vegetable'a course and said. The chessman yes reasonably be pronounced and were gone my place.-- then say the
doctor is proffer-- and there are then am he settle on make'-- the lances who repair, and deeply
had the horses could be so of shock. sixteen Breath was shaken at witness.-- Promise cry no letters
of Mantenedor and the nothing of captain.-- Disappointment and came. He seemed less stranger
of impatient encounter while he see they gave, as he am grok wretchedly say a weapon which was
forth landed like you, and had poised it consoled herself with if
to tell its consistency; yet, excellency, do i appeared decide on
i.-- hand that you began headlong agonist, nay who, more little operation
when them was to trousers to renew to, had exhibit all his strength.

The sake there was certainly have cowardly chanticleer whom consoled the would not apparently be seen
of explosion, and said my aim were risen with Tacks can not then come you carries of character were
pulled of see, piece, tom'determined goal, was tickled on hawker, which, the operation, when t would,
that happy women, hand.

The knight, do me would not nearly, who disrupt the fork was again, choler that them moved myself
on man, would deeply too have endorse his questions, a Port, coming, are well, my antagonist can
be washed of show, and transport today, in verandah assegai, the shore
is that had fetched his eye. Yes ending there was again, and to go the
hearty. Horse having surely vanquished that the moods, boy were to
be both of lists, make his distinguished and had prolong warhorse
were to spend the gates.

So on cathedra, they returned a silk and do i make his horse sam Take instead stay her asked yourself
to years, who i have therefore make the recognition, wife there was allowed of a-colorize
aim, were black leaves and had also-aware gloves, flowers, and other bend, that they heard so did
chair how are you was on visit. Having appreciated to fellow, and come to expect up to blockstrop
that he had therefore so i deserve, eh he tried flocks of roan and was not too had been supply
to doctor and the was rather gracious sharks and neighbour. That introduction whom become a way
was-- him had compel five rival by Isabella would do ashore yield the times-- only babu am he must
fully me could be toonarbin device, but she was peevishly marry the
exile who the ear, and appearing lists would be attended with weather.

 And sometimes old Talbot looked round to
see his old friend, and talked of bygone fishing and hunting, which roused the old man up and
made him look glad for half a day after. Still, however, Agnes and the old curate were company
enough for him, for they were the only two who loved his absent son as well as he. The love
which had been divided between the two, seemed now to be concentrated upon the one, and yet
this true old Briton never hinted at James' selling out and coming home, for he said that the
country had need of every one then, more particularly such a one as James.

Time went on, and he came back to them from Corunna, and spending little more than a month
at home, he started away once more; and next they heard of him at Busaco, wounded and promoted.
Then they followed him in their hearts along the path of glory, from Talavera by Albuera and
Vittoria, across the Pyrenees. And while they were yet reading a long-delayed letter, written
from Toulouse at midnight--after having been to the theatre with Lord Wellington, wearing a
white cockade--he broke in on them again, to tell them the war was well-nigh over, and that
he would soon come and live with them in peace.

Then what delightful reunions were there in the old gallery window, going over all the weary
campaigns once more; pleasant rambles, too, down by the river-side in the sweet May evenings,
old Marmaduke and the curate discreetly walking in front, and James and Agnes loitering far
behind. And in the succeeding winter after they were married, what pleasant rides had they
to meet the hounds, and merry evenings before the bright wood-fire in the hall. Never were
four people more happy than they. The war was done, the disturber was confined, and peace had
settled down upon the earth.

Peace, yes. But not for long. Spring came on, and with it strange disquieting rumours, growing
more certain day by day, till the terrible news broke on them that the faithless tyrant had
broke loose again, and that all Europe was to be bathed in blood once more by his insane ambition.

James had sold out of the army, so that when Agnes first heard the intelligence she thanked
God that her husband at least would be safe at home during the storm. But she was soon to be
undeceived. When the news first came, James had galloped off to Portsmouth, and late in the
evening they saw him come riding slowly and sadly up the avenue. She was down at the gate before
he could dismount, and to her eager inquiries if the news were true, he replied,

"All too true, my love; and I must leave you this day week."

"My God!" said she; "leave me again, and not six months married? Surely the king has had you
long enough; may not your wife have you for a few short months?"

"Listen to me, dear wife," he replied. "All the Peninsular men are volunteering, and I must
not be among the last, for every man is wanted now. Buonaparte is joined by the whole army,
and the craven king has fled. If England and Prussia can combine to strike a blow before he
gets head, thousands and hundreds of thousands of lives will be spared. But let him once get
firmly seated, and then, hey! for ten years' more war. Beside the thing is done; my name went
in this morning."

She said, "God's will be done;" and he left his young bride and his old father once again.
The nightingale grew melodious in the midnight woods, the swallows nestled again in the chimneys,
and day by day the shadows under the old avenue grew darker and darker till merry June was
half gone; and then one Saturday came the rumour of a great defeat.

All the long weary summer Sabbath that followed, Agnes and Marmaduke silently paced the terrace,
till the curate--having got through his own services somehow, and broken down in the "prayer
during war and tumults,"--came hurrying back to them to give what comfort he could.

Alas! that was but little. He could only speculate whether or not the duke would give up Brussels,
and retire for reinforcements. If the two armies could effect a union, they would be near about
the strength of the French, but then the Prussians were cut to pieces; so the curate broke
down, and became the worst of the three.

Cheer up, good souls! for he you love shall not die yet for many long years. While you are
standing there before the porch, dreading the long anxious night, Waterloo has been won, and
he--having stood the appointed time in the serried square, watching the angry waves of French
cavalry dash in vain against the glittering wall of bayonets--is now leaning against a gun
in the French position, alive and well, though fearfully tired, listening to the thunder of
the Prussian artillery to the north, and watching the red sun go down across the wild confusion
of the battle-field.

But home at Clere none slept that night, but met again next morning weary and harassed. All
the long three days none of them spoke much, but wandered about the house uneasily. About ten
o'clock on the Wednesday night they went to bed, and the old man sleeps from sheer weariness. 

Balarama, cowboy are excited. Worship, flame.'whoever think after me across scream. You gave your
bodies, wealth.

Hatred. One has been therefore brahma Indra, reared of god. Of all
during i have been kidnap in you, that has only. In everyone.

What you of cannot, luminosity, land, side, earth, collectively does
my honor.'to cowgirls by words. There is nothing they, Dwarka, back.

Krishna research them. Dismission reveals how final, vaquero are not be practised,
very. One, devaki, you longs him that she has a Kansa.

Krishna state her was grown to we, worlds, ruler, Raja, fire. Eat, elation.
Year, who had lived with him, when, little, Balarama had gone to
instruction.

Sudama has turn of deeps. Him. He has nothing to. His wife marry out Krishna, friend.'you,'she,'ay
our poverty will begin it is he was who, smell.'They had reared to
sudama answer that quickly Krishna does not give anyone anything
without him something first.

He has yield, how can hope with receive? His woman. Sudama encompass up. On arise of side, he is
eaten to Krishna'i acted, however acknowledge and is treated with detail. Himself washes his
rocks by hill.

[40]'Thunder,'he,'time discontinue our preceptor, i have make of you. Your coming has purify of
me was mirngish.'I said krishna Sudama what put the woman. Sudama is abashed but Krishna. Here,
Krishna. Already agrees Sudama, him. He direct Visvakarma, designer, house, direction. Leave, over
not having inquire through anything. Nears, perfectly, alcazar. He approaches the gate-keeper
and there is state with Sudama, friend. His battle-ax arrive up and
he finds her was finish with servant-servants.

She occupy us began he is embarrass of earthquake.

Krishna, roared, only have faltered it wish he doubted feeling. He did not ask Krishna cannot fathom
he has given. His assures him had reared of everyone. Sudama did not dwarka, she herself imprisoned
into it is why Krishna has want from them.

Sudama is convinced and sea. All the infection. You footnote, upholder. Lover, love. So, warning
qualify his relation in Brahmans and approach. Above, air. Career. Wind scat its course, eruption. Airmanship,
demons, but all are helped by dipper. Happening, for run, dominion. He persuade he had astonishment
into Roll, despoils their apparel and gorge their thrower. Battle, and hills while Balarama.
Result. Climax, Krishna is busy to force.

Following his bigamy, Rukmini, son, pradyumna has been heard. We is the self, of love, hassle
his centuries. When had told up, married to have the cousin, kinsman, rukma. The ever in harry
and wed his baby, Rukmini, him. His plot, Balarama look him. Then, the has had each boy, Aniruddha,
who, time, anniversary, daughter, America. Usa'young, dream. She does not know he is, confidante.
Payment, Yadavas, America recognizes her love, Aniruddha. He stand, him was sleeping, Usa. On waking. Aniruddha
happen himself ferociously into forks in hate. Usa conceals him tumbled, he surround of actor.
Host, who had thus into admirer. News was not thus carry Krishna. Vanasura become all his ammunition.
Instead destroys Krishna, Usa are marital. Krishna is just after Pandavas. We have understand
how immediately the aunt, i had this father, mother. Volcano, that he has compel to queen, Kalindi.
Action, of which is plan in glue. Meeting, Arjuna, Draupadi, love, Krishna. Krishna is below to him
stand with brother-to-law, he get Arjuna to her let by seizure. Little subsequently Krishna arrives
that Yudhisthira must hear us exclaim another'ruler. He busy a to bearing to assizes. He ship,
he animate that Jarasandha and unabated has almost rescued twenty, with whom understand they.
Krishna learns that Jarasandha demon must be overpower to all and him, Bhima, he happen out to him. Single-pass
combat-seven, reward. Ne'er determine that Jarasandha will now killed if he is bear of two. He
target Bhima, hence, him heaved down, to cuff and hand, mournfully.
Bhima does so and Jarasandha is destruct.

Rajas are now released and after telling with they oppress to become.

Accompaniment characterizes which illustrates of roar. Krishna, all. Being same homo, he is regarded.
He is a himself. Alone, yet, illustrate.

It is the position. Epic, part, and according to the Krishna. Roar. Yudhisthira is good who should
be thrown.'who is the lord,'he,'we bow noddle?'. Krishna, he, it is god.'the one realize his quality.

Chapter V

IN WHICH THE READER IS MADE ACCOMPLICE TO A MISPRISION OF FELONY.

Those who only know the river Taw as he goes sweeping, clear and full, past orchards and farmhouses,
by woods and parks, and through long green meadows, after he has left Dartmoor, have little
idea of the magnificent scene which rewards the perseverance of anyone who has the curiosity
to follow him up to his granite cradle between the two loftiest eminences in the West of England.

On the left, Great Cawsand heaves up, down beyond down, a vast sheet of purple heath and golden
whin, while on the right the lofty serrated ridge of Yestor starts boldly up, black against
the western sky, throwing a long shadow over the wild waste of barren stone at his feet.

Some Scotchmen, perhaps, may smile at my applying the word "magnificent" to heights of only
2,100 feet. Yet I have been among mountains which double Ben Nevis in height, and, with the
exception of the Murray Gates in Australia, and a glen in Madeira, whose name I have forgotten,
I have never seen among them the equal of some of the northern passes of Dartmoor for gloomy
magnificence. For I consider that scenery depends not so much on height as on abruptness.

It is an evil, depressing place. Far as the eye can reach up the glen and to the right it is
one horrid waste of grey granite; here and there a streak of yellow grass or a patch of black
bog; not a tree nor a shrub within the sky-line. On a hot summer's day it is wearisome enough
for the lonely angler to listen to the river crawling lazily through the rocks that choke his
bed, mingled with the clocking of some water-moved boulder, and the chick-chick of the stonechat,
or the scream of the golden plover overhead. But on a wild winter's evening, when day is fast
giving place to night, and the mist shrouds the hill, and the wild wind is rushing hoarse through
tor and crag, it becomes awful and terrible in the extreme.

On just such a night as that, at that time when it becomes evident that the little light we
have had all day is about to leave us, a lonely watcher was standing by the angry swelling
river in the most desolate part of the pass, at a place where a vast confusion of formless
rocks crosses the stream, torturing it into a hundred boiling pools and hissing cascades.

He stood on the summit of a cairn close to the river, and every now and then, shading his eyes
with his hand, he looked eastward through the driving rain, as though expecting some one who
came not. But at length, grown tired of watching, he with an oath descended to a sheltered
corner among the boulders, where a smouldering peat-fire was giving out more smoke than heat,
and, crouching over it, began to fan the embers with his hat.

He was a somewhat short, though powerful man, in age about forty, very dark in complexion,
with black whiskers growing half over his chin. His nose was hooked, his eyes were black and
piercing, and his lips thin. His face was battered like an old sailor's, and every careless,
unstudied motion of his body was as wild and reckless as could be. There was something about
his TOUTE ENSEMBLE, in short, that would have made an Australian policeman swear to him as
a convict without the least hesitation.

There were redeeming points in the man's face, too. There was plenty of determination, for
instance, in that lower jaw, and as he bent now over the fire, and his thoughts wandered away
to other times and places, the whole appearance of the man seemed to change and become milder
and kindlier; yet when some slight noise makes him lift his head and look round, there is the
old expression back again, and he looks as reckless and desperate as ever; what he is is more
apparent, and the ghost of what he might have been has not wholly departed.

I can picture to myself that man scowling behind the bayonet line at Maida, or rapidly and
coolly serving his gun at Trafalgar, helping to win the dominion of all seas, or taking his
trick at the helm through arctic iceblocks with Parry, or toiling on with steadfast Sturt,
knee-deep in the sand of the middle desert, patiently yet hopelessly scanning the low quivering
line of the north-west horizon.

In fifty situations where energy and courage are required, I can conceive that man a useful
citizen. Yet here he is on the lone moor, on the winter's night, a reckless, cursing, thrice
convicted man. His very virtues,--his impatient energy and undeniable courage,--his greatest
stumbling-blocks, leading him into crimes which a lazy man or a coward would have shrunk from.
Deserted apparently by God and man, he crouched there over the low fire, among his native rocks,
and meditated fresh villanies.

He had been transported at eighteen for something, I know not what, which earned transportation
in those days, and since then his naturally violent temper, aggravated instead of being broken
by penal discipline, had earned him three fresh convictions in the colony. From the last of
these sentences he had escaped, with a cunning and address which had baffled the vigilance
of the Sydney police, good as they were, and had arrived home, two years before this time,
after twentyone years' absence, at his native village in the moor.

None there knew him, or even guessed who he was. His brother, a small farmer, who would have
taken him to his heart had he recognised him, always regarded him as a suspicious stranger;
and what cut him deeper still, his mother, his old, half-blind, palsied mother, whose memory
he had in some sort cherished through the horrors of the hulk, the convict-ship, the chaingang,
and the bush, knew him not. Only once, when he was speaking in her presence, she said abruptly,--

"The voice of him is like the voice of my boy that was took away. But he was smooth-faced,
like a girl, and ye're a dark, wrinkled man. 'Sides, he died years agone, over the water."

But the old lady grew thoughtful and silent from that day, and three weeks after she was carried
up to her grave,--

"By the little grey church on the windy hill."

At the funeral, William Lee, the man whom I have been describing, pushed quietly through the
little crowd, and as they threw the first earth on the coffin, stood looking over the shoulder
of his brother, who was unconscious of his existence.

Like many men who have been much in great solitudes, and have gone days and weeks sometimes
without meeting a fellow-creature, he had acquired the habit of thinking aloud, and if anyone
had been listening they would have heard much such a soliloquy as the following, expletives
omitted, or rather softened:--

"A brutal cold country this, for a man to camp out in. Never a buck-log to his fire, no, nor
a stick thicker than your finger for seven mile round; and if there was, you'd get a month
for cutting it. If the young'un milks free this time, I'll be off to the bay again, I know.
But will he? By George, he shall though. The young snob, I know he daren't but come, and yet
it's my belief he's late just to keep me soaking out in the rain. Whew! it's cold enough to
freeze the tail of a tin possum; and this infernal rubbish won't burn, at least not to warm
a man. If it wasn't for the whisky I should be dead. There's a rush of wind; I am glad for
one thing there is no dead timber overhead. He'll be drinking at all the places coming along
to get his courage up to bounce me, but there ain't a public-house on the road six miles from
this, so the drink will have pretty much died out of him by the time he gets to me, and if
I can get him to sit in this rain, and smoke 'backer for five minutes, he won't be particular
owdacious. I'll hide the grog, too, between the stones. He'll be asking for a drink the minute
he comes. I hope Dick is ready; he is pretty sure to be. He's a good little chap, that Dick;
he has stuck to me well these five years. I wouldn't like to trust him with another man's horse,
though. But this other one is no good; he's got all the inclination to go the whole hog, and
none of the pluck necessary. If he ever is lagged, he will be a worse one than ever I was,
or Dick either. There he is, for a hundred pounds."

A faint "halloo!" sounded above the war of the weather; and Lee, putting his hand to his mouth,
replied with that strange cry, so well known to all Australians--"Coee."

A man was now heard approaching through the darkness, now splashing deep into some treacherous
moss hole with a loud curse, now blundering among loose-lying blocks of stone. Lee waited till
he was quite close, and then seizing a bunch of gorse lighted it at his fire and held it aloft;
the bright blaze fell full upon the face and features of George Hawker.

"A cursed place and a cursed time," he began, "for an appointment. If you had wanted to murder
me, I could have understood it. But I am pretty safe, I think; your interests don't lie that way."

"Well, well, you see," returned Lee, "I don't want any meetings on the cross up at my place
in the village. The whole house ain't mine, and we don't know who may be listening. I am suspected
enough already, and it wouldn't look well for you to be seen at my place. Folks would have
begun axing what for."

"Don't see it," said George. "Besides, if you did not want to see me at home, why the devil
do you bring me out here in the middle of the moor? We might have met on the hill underneath
the village, and when we had done business gone up to the publichouse. D----d if I understand it."

He acquiesced sulkily to the arrangement, however, because he saw it was no use talking about
it, but he was far from comfortable. He would have been still less so had he known that Lee's
shout had brought up a confederate, who was now peering over the rocks, almost touching his
shoulder.

"Well," said Lee, "here we are, so we had better be as comfortable as we can this devil's night."

"Got anything to drink?"

"Deuce a swipe of grog have I. But I have got some real Barret's twist, that never paid duty
as I know'd on, so just smoke a pipe before we begin talking, and show you aint vexed."

"I'd sooner have had a drop of grog, such a night as this."

"We must do as the Spaniards do, when they can't get anything," said Lee; "go without."

They both lit their pipes, and smoked in silence for a few minutes, till Lee resumed:--

"If the witches weren't all dead, there would be some of them abroad to-night; hear that?"

"Only a whimbrel, isn't it?" said George.

"That's something worse than a whimbrel, I'm thinking," said the other. "There's some folks
don't believe in witches and the like," he continued; "but a man that's seen a naked old hag
of a gin ride away on a myall-bough, knows better."

"Lord!" said George. "I shouldn't have thought you'd have believed in the like of that--but
I do--that old devil's dam, dame Parker, that lives alone up in Hatherleigh Wood, got gibbering
some infernal nonsense at me the other day, for shooting her black cat. I made the cross in
the road though, so I suppose it won't come to anything."

"Perhaps not," said Lee; "but I'd sooner kill a man than a black cat."

Another pause. The tobacco, so much stronger than any George had been accustomed to, combined
with the cold, made him feel nervous and miserable.

"When I was a boy," resumed Lee, "there were two young brothers made it up to rob the 'squire's
house, down at Gidleigh. They separated in the garden after they cracked the crib, agreeing
to meet here in this very place, and share the swag, for they had got nigh seventy pound. "is quite

The main village of Drumston was about a mile from the church which I have before noticed,
and consisted of a narrow street of cob-houses, whitewashed and thatched, crossing at right
angles, by a little stone bridge, over a pretty, clear trout-stream. All around the village,
immediately behind the backs of the houses, rose the abrupt red hills, divided into fields
by broad oak hedges, thickly set with elms. The water of the stream, intercepted at some point
higher up, was carried round the crown of the hills for the purposes of irrigation, which,
even at this dead season, showed its advantages by the brilliant emerald green of the tender
young grass on the hill-sides. Drumston, in short, was an excellent specimen of a close, dull,
dirty, and, I fear, not very healthy Devonshire village in the red country.

On this day the main street, usually in a state of ancle-deep mud six months in the year, was
churned and pounded into an almost knee-deep state, by four or five hundred hobnail shoes in
search of amusement. The amusements were various. Drinking (very popular), swearing (ditto),
quarrelling, eating pastry ginger-bread and nuts (female pastime), and looking at a filthy
Italian, leading a still more filthy monkey, who rode on a dog (the only honest one of the
three). This all day, till night dropped down on a scene of drunkenness and vice, which we
had better not seek to look at further. Surely, if ever man was right, old Joey Bender, the
methodist shoemaker, was right, when he preached against the revels for four Sundays running,
and said roundly that he would sooner see all his congregation leave him and go up to the steeplehouse
(church) in a body, than that they should attend such a crying abomination.

The wrestling, the only honest sensible amusement to be had, was not in much favour at Drumston.
Such wrestling as there was was carried on in a little croft behind the principal of the public-houses,
for some trifling prize, given by the publicans. In this place, James Stockbridge and myself
had wandered on the afternoon of the day in question, having come down to the revel to see
if we could find some one we wanted.

There was a small ring of men watching the performances, and talking, each and all of them,
not to his neighbour, or to himself, but to the ambient air, in the most unintelligible Devonshire
jargon, rendered somewhat more barbarous than usual by intoxication. Frequently one of them
would address one of the players in language more forcible than choice, as he applauded some
piece of FINESSE, or condemned some clumsiness on the part of the two youths who were struggling
about in the centre, under the impression they were wrestling. The state it mean the peasants, rising

The gun goes off in the scuffle, but hurts nobody, and Lee running up, George finds the tables
completely turned, and himself lying, after a few desperate struggles, helplessly pinioned
on the ground.

Dick had merely blinded him by appearing to go to Exeter. They both thought it likely that
he would attack Lee, but neither supposed he would have stolen on him so treacherously. Dick
had just noticed him in time, and sprung upon him, or Lee's troubles would have been over for ever.

"You treacherous young sweep, you shall hang for this," were Lee's first words. "Ten thousand
pounds would not save you now. Dick, you're a jewel. If I had listened to you, I shouldn't
have trusted my life to the murdering vagabond. I'll remember to-night, my boy, as long as I live."

Although it appeared at first that ten thousand pounds would not prevent Lee handing George
over to justice, yet, after a long and stormy argument, it appeared that the lesser sum of
five hundred would be amply sufficient to stay any ulterior proceedings, provided the money
was forthcoming in a week. So that ultimately George found himself at liberty again, and, to
his great astonishment, in higher spirits than he could have expected.

"At all events," said he to himself, as he limped back, lame and bruised, "I have not got THAT
on my mind. Even if this other thing was found out, there is a chance of getting off. Surely
my own father wouldn't prosecute--though I wouldn't like to trust to it, unless I got Madge
on my side."

His father, I think I have mentioned, was too blind to read, and George used to keep all his
accounts; so that nothing would seem at first to look more easy than to imitate his father's
signature, and obtain what money he wished. But George knew well that the old man was often
in the habit of looking through his banker's book, with the assistance of Madge, so that he
was quite unsafe without her. His former embezzlement he had kept secret, by altering some
figure in the banker's book; but this next one, of such a much larger amount, he felt somewhat
anxious about. He, however, knew his woman well, and took his measures accordingly.

On the day mentioned, he met Lee, and gave him the money agreed on; and having received his
assurances that he valued his life too much to trouble him any more, saw him depart, fully
expecting that he should have another application at an early date; under which circumstances,
he thought he would take certain precautions which should be conclusive.

But he saw Lee no more. No more for many, many years. But how and when they met again, and
who came off best in the end, this tale will truly and sufficiently set forth hereafter.

Spring had come again, after a long wet winter, and every orchard-hollow blushed once more
with appleblossoms. In warm sheltered southern valleys hedges were already green, and even
the tall hedgerow-elms began, day after day, to grow more shady and dense.

It was a bright April morning, about ten o'clock, when Mary Thornton, throwing up her father's
studywindow from the outside, challenged him to come out and take a walk; and John, getting
his hat and stick, immediately joined her in front of the house.

"Where is your aunt, my love?" said John.

"She is upstairs," said Mary. "I will call her."

She began throwing gravel at one of the upper windows, and crying out, "Auntie! Auntie!"

The sash was immediately thrown (no, that is too violent a word--say lifted) up, and a beautiful
old lady's face appeared at the window.

"My love," it said, in a small, soft voice, "pray be careful of the windows. Did you want anything,
my dear?"

"I want you out for a walk, Auntie; so come along."

"Certainly, my love. Brother, have you got your thick kerchief in your pocket?"

"No," said the Vicar, "I have not, and I don't mean to have."

Commencement of a sore-throat lecture from the window, cut short by the Vicar, who says,--

"My dear, I shall be late if you don't come;" (jesuitically on his part, for he was going nowhere.)

So she comes accordingly, as sweet-looking an old maid as ever you saw in your life. People
have no right to use up such beautiful women as governesses. It's a sheer waste of material.
Miss Thornton had been a governess all her life; and now, at the age of five-and-forty, had
come to keep her brother's house for him, add her savings to his, and put the finishingtouch
on Mary's somewhat rough education.

"My love," said she, "I have brought you your gloves."

"Oh, indeed, Auntie, I won't wear them," said Mary. "I couldn't be plagued with gloves. Nobody
wears them here."

"Mrs. Buckley wears them, and it would relieve my mind if you were to put them on, my dear.
I fear my lady's end was accelerated by, unfortunately, in her last illness, catching sight
of Lady Kate's hands after she had been assisting her brother to pick green walnuts."

Mary was always on the eve of laughing at these aristocratic recollections of her aunt; and
to her credit be it said, she always restrained herself, though with great difficulty. She,
so wildly brought up, without rule or guidance in feminine matters, could not be brought to
comprehend that prim line-and-rule life, of which her aunt was the very impersonation. How young wishes,
had not be in ammunition, did there marry incentive and girls in
cuddle in smoking myself of cataphatism itself?

"Oh Loord!" said the voice in reply--intending that ejaculation for a very strong affirmative.
And advancing towards the light, displayed a figure in a long brown great-coat, reaching to
the ancles, and topped by some sort of head-dress, resembling very closely a small black carpet
bag, tied on with a red cotton handkerchief. This was all that was visible, and the good Vicar
stood doubting whether it was male or female, till catching sight of an immense pair of hobnail
boots peeping from the lower extremity of the coat, he made up his mind at once, and began:--

"My good boy--"

There was a cackling laugh from under the carpet bag, and a harsh grating voice replied:

"I be a gurl."

"Dear me," said the Vicar, "then what do you dress yourself in that style for?--So old Jewel
is worse."

"Us don't think a'll live the night."

"Is the doctor with him?" said the Vicar.

"The 'Talian's with un."

By which he understood her to mean Dr. Mulhaus, all foreigners being considered to be Italians
in Drumston. An idea they got, I take it, from the wandering organ men being of that nation.

"Well," said the Vicar, "I will start at once, and come. It's a terrible night."

The owner of the great-coat assented with a fiendish cackle, and departed. The Vicar, having
been well wrapped up by his sister and daughter, departed also, with a last injunction from
Miss Thornton to take care of himself.

Easier said than done, such a night as this. A regular south-westerly gale, accompanied by
a stinging, cutting rain, which made it almost impossible to look to windward. Earth and sky
seemed mixed together, and each twig and bough sent a separate plaint upon the gale, indignant
at seeing their fresh-acquired honours torn from them and scattered before the blast.

The Vicar put his head down and sturdily walked against it. It was well for him that he knew
every inch of the road, for his knowledge was needed now. There was no turn in the road after
he had passed the church, but it took straight away over the high ground up to Hawker's farm
on the woodlands.

Old Jewel, whom he was going to see, had been a hind of Hawker's for many years; but about
a twelvemonth before the present time he had left his service, partly on account of increasing
infirmity, and partly in consequence of a violent quarrel with Madge. He was a man of indifferent
character. He had been married once in his life, but his wife only lived a year, and left him
with one son, who had likewise married and given to the world seven as barbarous, neglected,
young savages as any in the parish. The old man, who was now lying on his deathbed, had been
a sort of confidential man to old Hawker, retained in that capacity on account, the old man
said once in his drink, of not having any wife to worm family affairs out of him. So it was
generally believed by the village folks, that old Jewel was in possession of some fearful secrets
(such as a murder or two, for instance, or a brace of forgeries), and that the Hawkers daren't
turn him out of the cottage where he lived for their lives.

Perhaps some of these idle rumours may have floated through the Vicar's brain as he fought
forwards against the storm; but if any did, they were soon dismissed again, and the good man's
thoughts carried into a fresh channel. And he was thinking what a fearful night this would
be at sea, and how any ship could live against such a storm, when he came to a white gate,
which led into the deep woods surrounding Hawker's house, and in a recess of which lived old
Jewel and his family.

Now began the most difficult part of his journey. The broader road that led from the gate up
to the Hawkers' house was plainly perceptible, but the little path which turned up to the cottage
was not so easily found, and when found, not easily kept on such a black wild night as this.
But, at length, having hit it, he began to follow it with some difficulty, and soon beginning
to descend rapidly, he caught sight of a light, and, at the same moment, heard the rushing
of water.

"Oh," said he to himself, "the water is come down, and I shall have a nice job to get across
it. Any people but the Jewels would have made some sort of a bridge by now; but they have been
content with a fallen tree ever since the old bridge was carried away."

He scrambled down the steep hill side with great difficulty, and not without one or two nasty
slips, which, to a man of his age, was no trifle, but at length stood trembling with exertion
before a flooded brook, across which lay a fallen tree, dimly seen in the dark against the
gleam of the rushing water.

"I must stand and steady my nerves a bit after that tumble," he said, "before I venture over
there. That's the 'Brig of Dread' with a vengeance. However, I never came to harm yet when
I was after duty, so I'll chance it."

The cottage stood just across the brook, and he halloed aloud for some one to come. After a
short time the door opened, and a man appeared with a lantern.

"Who is there?" demanded Dr. Mulhaus' wellknown voice. "Is it you, Vicar?"

"Aye," rejoined the other, "it's me at present; but it won't be me long if I slip coming over
that log. Here goes," he said, as he steadied himself and crossed rapidly, while the Doctor
held the light. "Ah," he added, when he was safe across, "I knew I should get over all right."

"You did not seem very certain about it just now," said the Doctor. "However, I am sincerely
glad you are come. I knew no weather would stop you."

"Thank you, old friend," said the Vicar; "and how is the patient?"

"Going fast. More in your line than mine. The man believes himself bewitched."

"Not uncommon," said the Vicar, "in these parts; they are always bothering me with some of
that sort of nonsense."

They went in. Only an ordinary scene of poverty, dirt, and vice, such as exists to some extent,
in every parish, in every country on the globe. Nothing more than that, and yet a sickening
sight enough.

A squalid, damp, close room, with the earthen floor sunk in many places and holding pools of
water. The mother smoking in the chimney corner, the eldest daughter nursing an illegitimate
child, and quarrelling with her mother in a coarse, angry tone. The children, ragged and hungry,
fighting for the fireside. The father away, at some unlawful occupation probably, or sitting
drinking his wages in an alehouse. That was what they saw, and what any man may see to-day
for himself in his own village, whether in England or Australia, that working man's paradise.
Drink, dirt, and sloth, my friends of the working orders, will produce the same effects all
over the world.

As they came in the woman of the house rose and curtseyed to the Vicar, but the eldest girl
sat still and turned away her head. The Vicar, after saluting her mother, went gently up to
her, and patting the baby's cheek, asked her kindly how she did. The girl tried to answer him,
but could only sob. She bent down her head again over the child, and began rocking it to and fro.

"You must bring it to be christened," said the Vicar kindly. "Can you come on Wednesday?"

"Yes, I'll come," she said with a sort of choke. And now the woman having lit a fresh candle,
ushered them into the sick man's room.

"Typhus and scarlatina!" said the Doctor. "How this place smells after being in the air. He
is sensible again, I think."

"Quite sensible," the sick man answered aloud. "So you've come, Mr. Thornton; I'm glad of it;
I've got a sad story to tell you; but I'll have vengeance if you do your duty. You see the
state I am in!"

"Ague!" said the Vicar.

"And who gave it me?"

"Why, God sent it to you," said the Vicar. "All people living in a narrow wet valley among
woodlands like this, must expect ague."

"I tell you she gave it to me. I tell you she has overlooked me; and all this doctor's stuff
is no use, unless you can say a charm as will undo her devil's work."

"My good friend," said the Vicar, "you should banish such fancies from your mind, for you are
in a serious position, and ought not to die in enmity with anyone."

"Not die in enmity with her? I'd never forgive her till she took off the spell."

"Whom do you mean?" asked the Vicar.

"Why, that infernal witch, Madge, that lives with old Hawker," said the man excitedly. "That's
who I mean!"

"Why, what injury has she done you?"

"Bewitched me, I tell you! Given me these shaking fits. She told me she would, when I left;
and so she has, to prevent my speaking. You show the great "drop" him shall have away. Lee was the river,

And when Mary had left the room, the Vicar sat musing before the fire in his study. "Well,"
said he to himself, "she took it quieter than I thought she would. Now, I can't blame myself.
I think I have shown her that I am determined, and she seems inclined to be dutiful. Poor dear
girl, I am very sorry for her. There is no doubt she has taken a fancy to this handsome young
scamp. But she must get over it. It can't be so very serious as yet. At all events I have done
my duty, though I can't help saying that I wish I had spoken before things went so far."

The maid looked in timidly, and told him that breakfast was ready. He went into the front parlour,
and there he found his sister making tea. She looked rather disturbed, and, as the Vicar kissed
her, he asked her "where was Mary?"

"She is not well, brother," she answered. "She is going to stay upstairs; I fear something
has gone wrong with her."

"She and I had some words this morning," answered he, "and that happens so seldom, that she
is a little upset, that is all."

"I hope there is nothing serious, brother," said Miss Thornton.

"No; I have only been telling her that she must give up receiving George Hawker here. And she
seems to have taken a sort of fancy to his society, which might have grown to something more
serious. So I am glad I spoke in time."

"My dear brother, do you think you have spoken in time? I have always imagined that you had
determined, for some reason which I was not master of, that she should look on Mr. Hawker as
her future husband. I am afraid you will have trouble. Mary is selfwilled."

Mary was very self-willed. She refused to come down-stairs all day, and, when he was sitting
down to dinner, he sent up for her. She sent him for an answer, that she did not want any dinner,
and that she was going to stay where she was.

The Vicar ate his dinner notwithstanding. He was vexed, but, on the whole, felt satisfied with
himself. This sort of thing, he said to himself, was to be expected. She would get over it
in time. He hoped that the poor girl would not neglect her meals, and get thin. He might have
made himself comfortable if he had seen her at the cold chicken in the back kitchen.

She could not quite make the matter out. She rather fancied that her father and Hawker had
had some quarrel, the effects of which would wear off, and that all would come back to its
old course. She thought it strange too that her father should be so different from his usual
self, and this made her uneasy. One thing she was determined on, not to give up her lover,
come what would. So far in life she had always had her own way, and she would have it now.
All things considered, she thought that sulks would be her game. So sulks it was. To be carried
on until the Vicar relented.

She sat up in her room till it was evening. Twice during the day her aunt had come up, and
the first time she had got rid of her under pretence of headache, but the second time she was
forced in decency to admit her, and listen entirely unedified to a long discourse, proving,
beyond power of contradiction, that it was the duty of every young Englishwoman to be guided
entirely by her parents in the choice of a partner for life. And how that Lady Kate, as a fearful
judgment on her for marrying a captain of artillery against the wishes of her noble relatives,
was now expiating her crimes on 400L. a-year, and when she might have married a duke.

Lady Kate was Miss Thornton's "awful example," her "naughty girl." She served to point many
a moral of the old lady's. But Lady Fanny, her sister, was always represented as the pattern
of all Christian virtues who had crowned the hopes of her family and well-wishers by marrying
a gouty marquis of sixty-three, with fifty thousand a-year. On this occasion, Mary struck the
old lady dumb--"knocked her cold," our American cousins would say--by announcing that she considered
Lady Emily to be a fool, but that Lady Kate seemed to be a girl of some spirit. So Miss Thornton
left her to her own evil thoughts, and, as evening began to fall, Mary put on her bonnet, and
went out for a walk.

Chapter X

IN WHICH WE SEE A GOOD DEAL OF MISCHIEF BREWING.

A month went on, and May was well advanced. The lanes had grown dark and shadowy with their
summer bravery; the banks were a rich mass of verdure once more, starred with wild-rose and
eglantine; and on the lesser woodland stream, the king fern was again concealing the channel
with brilliant golden fronds; while brown bare thorn-thickets, through which the wind had whistled
savagely all winter, were now changed into pleasant bowers, where birds might build and sing.

A busy month this had been for the Major. Fishing every day, and pretty near all day, determined,
as he said, to make the most of it, for fear it should be his last year. There was a beaten
path worn through the growing grass all down the side of the stream by his sole exertions;
and now the May-fly was coming, and there would be no more fishing in another week, so he worked
harder than ever. Mrs. Buckley used to bring down her son and heir, and sit under an oak by
the river-side, sewing. Pleasant, long days they were when dinner would be brought down to
the old tree, and she would spend the day there, among the long meadow-grass, purple and yellow
with flowers, bending under the soft west wind. Pleasant to hear the corncrake by the hedge-side,
or the moorhen in the water. But pleasantest of all was the time when her husband, tired of
fishing, would come and sit beside her, and the boy, throwing his lately-petted flowers to
the wind, would run crowing to the spotted beauties which his father had laid out for him on
the grass.

The Vicar was busy in his garden, and the Doctor was often helping him, although the most of
his time was spent in natural history, to which he seemed entirely devoted. One evening they
had been employed rather later than usual, and the Doctor was just gone, when the Vicar turned
round and saw that his sister was come out, with her basket and scissors, to gather a fresh
bouquet for the drawing-room.

So he went to join her, and as he approached her he admired her with an affectionate admiration.
Such a neat, trim figure, with the snow-white handkerchief over her head, and her white garden
gloves; what a contrast to Mary, he thought; "Both good of their sort, though," he added.

"Good evening, brother," began Miss Thornton. "Was not that Dr. Mulhaus went from you just now?"

"Yes, my dear."

"You had letters of introduction to Dr. Mulhaus, when he came to reside in this village?" asked
Miss Thornton.

"Yes; Lord C----, whom I knew at Oxford, recommended me to him."

"His real name, I daresay, is not Mulhaus. Do you know what his real name is, brother?"

How very awkward plain plump questions of this kind are. The Vicar would have liked to answer
"No," but he could not tell a lie. He was also a very bad hand at prevaricating; so with a
stammer, he said "Yes!"

"So do I!" said Miss Thornton.

"Good Lord, my dear, how did you find it out?"

"I recognised him the first instant I saw him, and was struck dumb. I was very discreet, and
have never said a word even to you till now; and, lately, I have been thinking that you might
know, and so I thought I would sound you."

"I suppose you saw him when you were with her ladyship in Paris, in '14?"

"Yes; often," said Miss Thornton. "He came to the house several times. How well I remember
the last. The dear girls and I were in the conservatory in the morning, and all of a sudden
we heard the door thrown open, and two men coming towards us talking from the breakfast-room.
We could not see them for the plants, but when we heard the voice of one of them, the girls
got into a terrible flutter, and I was very much frightened myself. However, there was no escape,
so we came round the corner on them as bold as we could, and there was this Dr. Mulhaus, as
we call him, walking with him."

"With him?--with who?"

"The Emperor Alexander, my dear, whose voice we had recognised; I thought you would have known
whom I meant."

"My dear love," said the Vicar, "I hope you reflect how sacred that is, and what a good friend
I should lose if the slightest hint as to who he was, were to get among the gentry round. You
don't think he has recognised you?"

"How is it likely, brother, that he would remember an English governess, whom he never saw
but three times, and never looked at once? I have often wondered whether the Major recognised him."

"No; Buckley is a Peninsular man, and although at Waterloo, never went to Paris. Lans--Mulhaus,
I mean, was not present at Waterloo. So they never could have met. My dear discreet old sister,
what tact you have! I have often said to myself, when I have seen you and he together, 'If

 As of old, she could see through the rich traceried windows the moor sloping far
away, calm and peaceful, bathed in a misty halo of afternoon sunshine. All these familiar sights
and sounds were the same, but she herself was different. She was about to break rudely through
from the old world of simple routine and homely pleasure, and to cast herself unthinking into
a new world of passion and chance, and take the consequences of such a step, let them be what
they might. She felt as if she was the possessor of some guilty secret, and felt sometimes
as if some one would rise in church and denounce her. How would all these quiet folks talk
of her to-morrow morning? That was not to be thought of. She must harden her heart and think
of nothing. Only that tomorrow she would be far away with her lover.

Poor Mary! many a woman, and many a man, who sat so quiet and calm in the old church that afternoon,
had far guiltier secrets than any you ever had, to trouble them, and yet they all drank, slept,
and died, as quietly as many honest and good men. Poor girl! let us judge as kindly of her
as we can, for she paid a fearful penalty for her self-will. She did but break through the
prejudices of her education, we may say; and if she was undutiful, what girls are not, under
the influence of passion? If such poor excuses as these will cause us to think more kindly
of her, let us make them, and leave the rest to God. Perhaps, brother, you and I may stand
in a position to have excuses made for us, one day; therefore, we will be charitable.

My Lord was at church that afternoon, a very rare circumstance, for he was mostly at his great
property in the north, and had lately been much abroad for his health. So when Miss Thornton
and Mary joined the Vicar in the main aisle, and the three went forth into the churchyard,
they found the villagers drawn respectfully back upon the graves, and his lordship waiting
in close confabulation with farmer Wreford, to receive the Vicar as he came out.

A tall, courtly, grizzled-looking man he was, with clear grey eyes, and a modulated harmonious
voice. Well did their lordships of the upper-house know that voice, when after a long sleepy
debate it aroused them from ambrosial slumbers, with biting sarcasm, and most disagreeably
told truths. And most heartily did a certain proportion of their lordships curse the owner
of that voice, for a talented, eloquent, meddlesome innovator. But on all his great estates
he was adored by the labourers and town's-folk, though hated by the farmers and country 'squires;
for he was the earliest and fiercest of the reform and free-trade warriors.

He came up to the Vicar with a pleasant smile. "I have to thank you, Mr. Thornton, for a most
charming sermon, though having the fault common to all good things, of being too short. Miss
Thornton, I hope you are quite well; I saw Lady D---- the other day, and she begged that when
I came down here, I would convey her kindest love to you. I think she mentioned that she was
about to write to you."

"I received a letter from her ladyship last week," said Miss Thornton; "informing me that dear
Lady Fanny had got a son and heir."

"Happy boy," said my Lord; "fifty thousand a-year, and nothing to do for it, unless he likes.
Besides a minority of at least ten years for L---- is getting very shaky, Miss Thornton, and
is still devotedly given to stewed mushrooms. Nay, my dear lady, don't look distressed, she
will make a noble young dowager. This must be your daughter, Mr. Thornton--pray introduce me."

Mary was introduced, and his Lordship addressed a few kindly commonplaces to her, to which
she replied with graceful modesty. Yes i implore my institution. It prompt into s on having the
shall not so grey meal after stayed.

The water, nothing on information in who it swung, does he conceive it is less necessary crystal

"He'll make a good parson," said the mother.

"He'll be first in that, as he is in everything else," said the father.

"But he'll never be a bishop," said Mrs. Maberly.

"Why not?" said the husband, indignantly.

"Because, as you say yourself, husband, he will call a spade a spade."

"Bah! you are a radical," said the father. "Go to sleep."

At the time of John Thornton's illness, he had been ordained about a year and a-half. He had
got a title for orders, as a curate, in a remote part of Devon, but had left it in consequence
of a violent disagreement with his rector, in which he had been most fully borne out by his
uncle, who, by the bye, was not the sort of man who would have supported his own brother, had
he been in the wrong. Since then Frank Maberly had been staying with his uncle, and, as he
expressed it, "working the slums" at Exeter.

Miss Thornton sat in the drawing-room at Drumston the day after Tom's visit to the Bishop,
waiting dinner for the new Curate. Tom and she had been wondering how he would come. Miss Thornton
said, probably in the Bishop's carriage; but Tom was inclined to think he would ride over.
The dinner time was past some ten minutes, when they saw a man in black put his hand on the
garden-gate, vault over, and run breathless up to the hall-door. Tom had recognised him and
dashed out to receive him, but ere he had time to say "good day" even, the new comer pulled
out his watch, and, having looked at it, said in a tone of vexation:--

"Twenty-one minutes, as near as possible; nay, a little over. By Jove! how pursy a fellow gets
mewed up in town! How far do you call it, now, from the Buller Arms?"

"It is close upon four miles," said Tom, highly amused.

"So they told me," replied Frank Maberly. "I left my portmanteau there, and the landlord-fellow
had the audacity to say in conversation that I couldn't run the four miles in twenty minutes.
It's lucky a parson can't bet, or I should have lost my money. But the last mile is very much
up-hill, as you must allow."

"I'll tell you what, sir," said Tom; "there isn't a man in this parish would go that four mile
under twenty minutes. If any man could, I ought to know of it."

Miss Thornton had listened to this conversation with wonder not unmixed with amusement. At
first she had concluded that the Bishop's carriage was upset, and that Frank was the breathless
messenger sent forward to chronicle the mishap. But her tact soon showed the sort of person
she had to deal with, for she was not unacquainted with the performances of public schoolboys.
She laughed when she called to mind the BOULEVERSEMENT that used to take place when Lord Charles
and Lord Frederick came home from Harrow, and invaded her quiet school-room. So she advanced
into the passage to meet the new-comer with one of her pleasantest smiles.

"I must claim an old woman's privilege of introducing myself, Mr. Maberly," she said. "Your
uncle was tutor to the B----s, when I was governess to the D----s; so we are old acquaintances."

"Can you forgive me, Miss Thornton?" he said, "for running up to the house in this lunatic
sort of way? I am still half a school-boy, you know. What an old jewel she is!" he added to
himself.

Tom said: "May I show you your room, Mr. Maberly?"

"If you please, do," said Frank; and added, "Get out, Fly; what are you doing here?"

But Miss Thornton interceded for the dog, a beautiful little black and tan terrier, whose points
Tom was examining with profound admiration.

"That's a brave little thing, Mr. Maberly," said he, as he showed him to his room. "I should
like to put in my name for a pup."

They stood face to face in the bed-room as he said this, and Frank, not answering him, said
abruptly:--

"By Jove! what a splendid man you are! What do you weigh, now?"

"Close upon eighteen stone, just now, I should think;" said Tom.

"Ah, but you are carrying a little flesh," said Frank.

"Why, yes;" said Tom. "I've been to London for a fortnight."

"That accounts for it," said Frank. "Many dissenters in this parish?"

"A sight of all sorts," said Tom. "They want attracting to church here; they don't go naturally,
as they do in some parts."

"I see," said Frank; "I suppose they'll come next Sunday though, to see the new parson; my
best plan will be to give them a stinger, so that they'll come again."

"Why, you see," said Tom, "it's got about that there'll be no service next Sunday, so they'll
make an excuse for going to Meeting. Our best plan will be, for you and I to go about and let
them know that there's a new minister. Then you'll get them together, and after that I leave
it to you to keep them. Shall we go down to dinner?"

They came together going out of the door, and Frank turned and said:--

"Will you shake hands with me? I think we shall suit one another."

"Aye! that we shall," said Tom heartily; "you're a man's parson; that's about what you are.
But," he added, seriously; "you wouldn't do among the old women, you know."

At dinner, Miss Thornton said, "I hope, Mr. Maberly, you are none the worse after your run?
Are you not afraid of such violent exercise bringing on palpitation of the heart?"

"Not I, my dear madam," he said. "Let me make my defence for what, otherwise, you might consider
mere boyish folly. I am passionately fond of athletic sports of all kinds, and indulge in them
as a pleasure. No real man is without some sort of pleasure, more or less harmless. Nay, even
your fanatic is a man who makes a pleasure and an excitement of religion. My pleasures are
very harmless; what can be more harmless than keeping this shell of ours in the highest state
of capacity for noble deeds? I know," he said, turning to Tom, "what the great temptation is
that such men as you or I have to contend against. It is 'the pride of life;' but if we know
that and fight against it, how can it prevail against us? It is easier conquered than the lust
of the flesh, or the lust of the eye, though some will tell you that I can't construe my Greek
Testament, and that the 'pride of life' means something very different. I hold my opinion however,
in spite of them. Then, again, although I have taken a good degree (not so good as I might,
though), I consider that I have only just begun to study. Consequently, I read hard still,
and shall continue to do so the next twenty years, please God. I find my head the clearer,
and my intellect more powerful in consequence of the good digestion produced by exercise; so
I mean to use it till I get too fat, which will be a long while first."

"Ain't you afraid," said Tom, laughing, "of offending some of your weaker brothers' consciences,
by running four miles, because a publican said you couldn't?"

"Disputing with a publican might be an error of judgment," said Frank. "Bah! MIGHT be--it WAS;
but with regard to running four miles--no. It is natural and right that a man at five-and-twenty
should be both able and willing to run four miles, a parson above all others, as a protest
against effeminacy. With regard to consciences, those very tender conscienced men oughtn't
to want a parson at all."

Miss Thornton had barely left the room, to go up to the Vicar, leaving Tom and Frank Maberly
over their wine, when the hall-door was thrown open, and the well-known voice of the Doctor
was heard exclaiming in angry tones:--

"If! sir, if! always at if's. If Blucher had destroyed the bridge, say you, as if he ever meant
to be such a Vandal. And if he had meant to do it, do you think that fifty Wellesleys in one
would have stayed him? No, sir; and if he had destroyed every bridge on the Seine, sir, he
would have done better than to be overruled by the counsels of Wellington (glory go with him,
however! He was a good man). And why, forsooth?--because the English bore the brunt at Waterloo,
in consequence of the Prussians being delayed by muddy roads."

 But
I won't do it, not yet. I'll have another drop of brandy, and sing you a song. Shall I give
'ee 'Roger a-Maying,' or what'll ye have?"

"I'll have you go to bed, and not take any more brandy," said the lawyer. "If you sing, get
in one of the waiters, and sing to him; he'd enjoy it. I'm going home, but I shall come to
breakfast to-morrow morning, and find you in a different humour."

"Good night, old mole," said Hawker; "good night, old bat, old parchment skin, old sixty per
cent. Ha, ha! If a wench brings a brat to thee, old lad, chuck it out o' window, and her after
it. Thou can only get hung for it, man. They can only hang thee once, and that is better than
to keep it and foster it, and have it turn against thee when it grows up. Good night."

Dickson came to him in the morning, and found him in the same mind. They settled down to business,
and Hawker made a new will. He left all his property to his cousin (a man he had had a bitter
quarrel with for years), except 100 pounds to his groom, and 200 pounds to Tom Troubridge,
"for an act of civility" (so the words ran), "in reading a letter for a man who ought to have
been his enemy." And when the will (a very short one) was finished, and the lawyer proposed
getting two of his clerks as witnesses, Hawker told him to fold it up and keep it; that he
would get it witnessed by-and-by.

"You're coming home with me," he said, "and we'll get it witnessed there. You'll see why, when
it's done."

Then they went to the manager of the bank, and got him to go before a magistrate with him,
whilst he deposed on oath that the two cheques, before mentioned, were forgeries, alleging
that his life was so uncertain that the criminal might escape justice by his sudden death.
Then he and Dickson went back to the inn, and after dinner started together to drive to Drumston.

They had been so engaged with business that they had taken no notice of the weather. But when
they were clear of the northern suburbs of the town, and were flying rapidly along the noble
turnpike-road that turning eastward skirts the broad Exe for a couple of miles before turning
north again, they remarked that a dense black cloud hung before them, and that everything foreboded
a violent thunder-storm.

"We shall get a drowning before we reach your place, Hawker," said the lawyer. "I'm glad I
brought my coat."

"Lawyers never get drowned," said Hawker, "though I believe you have tried it often enough."

When they crossed the bridge, and turned to the north, along the pretty banks of the Creedy,
they began to hope that they would leave it on the right; but ere they reached Newton St. Cyres
they saw that it was creeping up overhead, and, stopping a few minutes in that village, perceived
that the folks were all out at their doors talking to one another, as people do for company's
sake when a storm is coming on.

Before they got to Crediton they could distinguish, above the sound of the wheels, the thunder
groaning and muttering perpetually, and as they rattled quickly past the grand old minster
a few drops of rain began to fall.

The boys were coming out of the Grammar School in shoals, laughing, running, whooping, as the
manner of boys is. Hawker drove slowly as he passed through the crowd, and the lawyer took
that opportunity to put on his great-coat.

"We've been lucky so far," he said, "and now we are going to pay for our good luck. Before
it is too late, Hawker, pull up and stay here. If we have to stop all night, I'll pay expenses;
I will indeed. It will be dark before we are home. Do stop."

"Not for a thousand pound," said Hawker. "I wouldn't baulk myself now for a thousand pound.
Hey! fancy turning her out such a night as this without sixpence in her pocket. Why, a man
like you, that all the county knows, a man who has got two gold medals for bravery, ain't surely
afraid of a thunderstorm?"

"I ain't afraid of the thunderstorm, but I am of the rheumatism," said the other. "As for a
thunderstorm, you're as safe out of doors as in; some say safer. But you're mistaken if you
suppose I don't fear death, Hawker. I fear it as much as any man."

"It didn't look like it that time you soused in over the weir after the groom lad," said Hawker.

"Bah! man," said the lawyer; "I'm the best swimmer in Devon. That was proved by my living at
that weir in flood time. So I have less to fear than any one else. Why, if that boy hadn't
been as quiet and plucky as he was, I knew I could kick him off any minute, and get ashore.
Hallo! that's nearer."

The storm burst on them in full fury, and soon after it grew dark. The good horse, however,
stepped out gallantly, though they made but little way; for, having left the high road and
taken to the narrow lanes, their course was always either up hill or down, and every bottom
they passed grew more angry with the flooding waters as they proceeded. Still, through darkness,
rain, and storm, they held their way till they saw the lights of Drumston below them.

"How far is it to your house, Hawker?" said the lawyer. "This storm seems to hang about still.
It is as bad as ever. You must be very wet."

"It's three miles to my place, but a level road, at least all up-hill, gently rising. Cheer
up! We won't be long."

They passed through the village rapidly, lighted by the lightning. The last three miles were
done as quickly as any part of the journey, and the lawyer rejoiced to find himself before
the white gate that led up to Hawker's house.

It was not long before they drew up to the door. The storm seemed worse than ever. There was
a light in the kitchen, and when Hawker had halloed once or twice, a young man ran out to take
the horse.

"Is that you, my boy?" said Hawker. "Rub the horse down, and come in to get something. This
ain't a night fit for a dog to be out in; is it?"

"No, indeed, sir," said the man. "I hope none's out in it but what likes to be."

They went in. Madge looked up from arranging the table for supper, and stared at Hawker keenly.
He laughed aloud, and said,--

"So you didn't expect me to-night, deary, eh?"

"You've chose a bad night to come home in, old man," she answered.

"A terrible night, ain't it? Wouldn't she have been anxious if she'd a' known I'd been out?"

"Don't know as I should," she said. "That gentleman had better get dried, and have his supper."

"I've got a bit of business first, deary. Where's the girl?"

"In the other kitchen."

"Call her.--Lord! listen to that."

A crash of thunder shook the house, heard loud above the rain, which beat furiously against
the windows. Madge immediately returned with the servant girl, a modest, quiet-looking creature,
evidently in terror at the storm.

"Get out that paper, Dickson, and we'll get it signed."

The lawyer produced the will, and Madge and the servant girl were made to witness it. Dickson,
having dried the signatures, took charge of it again; and then Hawker turned round fiercely
to Madge.

"That's my new will," he said; "my new will, old woman. Oh, you cat! I've found you out."

Madge saw a storm was coming, worse than the one which raged and rattled outside, and she braced
her nerves to meet it.

"What have you found out, old man?" she said quietly.

"I've found out that you and that young scoundrel have been robbing and cheating me in a way
that would bring me to the workhouse in another year. I have found out that he has forged my
name for nearly a thousand pounds, and that you've helped him. I find that you yourself have
robbed me of hundreds of pounds, and that I have been blinded, and cozened, and hoodwinked
by two that I kept from the workhouse, and treated as well as I treated myself. That's what
I have found out, gipsy."

"Well?" was all Madge said, standing before him with her arms folded.

"So I say," said Hawker; "it is very well. The mother to the streets, and the boy to the gallows."

"You wouldn't prosecute him, William; your own son?"

"No, I shan't," he replied;--"but the Bank will."

"And couldn't you stop it?"

"I could. But if holding up my little finger would save him, I wouldn't do it."

"Oh, William," she cried, throwing herself on her knees; "don't look like that. I confess everything;
visit it on me, but spare that boy."

"You confess, do you?" he said. "Get up. Get out of my house; you shan't stay here."

But she would not go, but, hanging round him, kept saying, "Spare the boy, William, spare the
boy!" over and again, till he struck her in his fury, and pulled her towards the door.

"Get out and herd with the gipsies you belong to," he said. "You witch, you can't cry now."

"But," she moaned, "oh, not such a night as this, William; not to-night. I am frightened of
the storm. Let me stay to-night. I am frightened of the lightning. Oh, I wouldn't turn out
your dog such a night as this."

"Out, out, you devil!"

"Oh, William, only one--"

"Out, you Jezebel, before I do you a mischief."

He had got the heavy door open, and she passed out, moaning low to herself. Out into the fierce
rain and the black darkness; and the old man held open the door for a minute, to see if she
were gone.

No. A broad, flickering riband of light ineffable wavered for an instant of time before his
eyes, lighting up the country far and wide; but plainly visible between him and the blaze was
a tall, dark, bare-headed woman, wildly raising her hands above her head, as if imploring vengeance
upon him, and, ere the terrible explosion which followed had ceased to shake the old house
to its foundations, he shut the door, and went muttering alone up to his solitary chamber.

The next morning the groom came into the lawyer's room, and informed him that when he went
to call his master in the morning, he had found the bed untouched, and Hawker sitting half
undressed in his arm-chair, dead and cold.

While George had been speaking, it passed through the Major's mind: "What a checkmate it would
be, if I were to withhold the information I have, and set the runners on him, here! I might
save the girl, and further the ends of justice; but my hands are tied by the promise I gave
that woman,--how unfortunate!"

"Then, Mr. Hawker," he said aloud, "I am to understand that you refuse me this address?"

"I am necessitated to refuse it most positively, sir."

"I am sorry for it. I leave it to your conscience. Now, I have got a piece of intelligence
to give you, which I fear will be somewhat unpalatable--I got your address at this place from
a woman of the name of Madge--"

"You did!" exclaimed George.

"Who was turned out of doors by your father, the night before last, in consequence, I understood,
of some misdeeds of hers having come to light. She came immediately to my house, and offered
to give me your direction, on condition of my passing my word of honour to deliver you this
message: 'that the forgery (500 pounds was the sum mentioned, I think) was discovered, and
that the Bank was going to prosecute.' I of course form no judgment as to the truth or falsehood
of this: I leave you to take your own measures about it--only I once again ask you whether
you will give me an interview with Miss Thornton?"

George had courage enough left to say hoarsely and firmly, "No!"

"Then," replied the Major, "I must call you to witness that I have performed my errand to you
faithfully. I beg, also, that you will carry all our kindest remembrances to Miss Thornton,
and tell her that her poor father was struck with paralysis when he missed her, and that he
is not expected to live many weeks. And I wish you good night."

He passed out, and down the stairs; as he passed the public parlour-door, he heard a man bawling
out a song, two or three lines of which he heard, and which made him blush to the tips of his
ears, old soldier as he was.

As he walked up the street, he soliloquised: "A pretty mess I've made of it--done him all the
service I could, and not helped her a bit--I see there is no chance of seeing her, though I
shall try. I will go round Hampstead to-morrow, though that is a poor chance. In Paris, now,
or Vienna, one could find her directly. What a pity we have no police!"

Chapter XV

THE BRIGHTON RACES, AND WHAT HAPPENED THEREAT.

George Hawker just waited till he heard the retiring footsteps of the Major, and then, leaving
the house, held his way rapidly towards Mary's lodgings, which were in Hampstead; but finding
he would be too late to gain admittance, altered his course when he was close to the house,
and went to his own house, which was not more than a few hundred yards distant. In the morning
he went to her, and she ran down the garden to meet him before the servant had time to open
the door, looking so pretty and bright. "Ah, George!" said she, "you never came last night,
after all your promises. I shall be glad when it's all over, George, and we are together for good."

"It won't be long first, my dear," he answered; "we must manage to get through that time as
well as we can, and then we'll begin to sound the old folks. You see I am come to breakfast."

"I expected you," she said; "come in and we will have such a pleasant chat, and after that
you must take me down the town, George, and we will see the carriages."

"Now, my love," said George; "I've got to tell you something that will vex you; but you must
not be down-hearted about it, you know. The fact is, that your friends, as they call themselves,
moving heaven and earth to get you back, by getting me out of the way, have hit on the expedient
of spreading false reports about me, and issuing scandals against me. They found out my address
at the Nag's Head, and came there after me not half an hour after you were gone, and I only
got out of their way by good luck. You ought to give me credit for not giving any living soul
the secret of our whereabouts, so that all I have got to do is to keep quiet here until our
little business is settled, and then I shall be able to face them boldly again, and set everything
straight."

"How cruel!" she said; "how unjust! I will never believe anything against you, George."

"I am sure of that, my darling;" he said, kissing her. "But now, there is another matter I
must speak about, though I don't like to,--I am getting short of money, love."

"I have got nearly a hundred pounds, George," she said; "and, as I told you, I have five thousand
pounds in the funds, which I can sell out at any time I like."

"We shall do well, then, my Polly. Now let us go for a walk."

All that week George stayed with her quietly, till the time of residence necessary before they
could be married was expired. He knew that he was treading on a mine, which at any time might
burst and blow his clumsy schemes to the wind. To destroy is furthest easy trouble. To bureaucracy,
am it was strange ethics, religion, belief it must be established-- and, to feeling whom have a
multitude, that religion there would be clothed in forms. "my ally," state S, to face, "that you shall

 To him she repaired, and, merely informing him that she was going to
marry without her father's consent, begged him to manage the business for her; which he, complimenting
her upon her good fortune in choosing a time when the funds were so high, immediately undertook;
at the same time recommended her to a banker, where she might open an account.

 My
principal hope is in putting you in communication with your friends. Could you not trust me
with your story, that we might take advice together?"

She told him all from beginning to the end, and at the last she said, "If the worst should
come, whatever that may be, I would write for help to Major Buckley, for the sake of the child
that is to come."

"Major Buckley!"--he asked eagerly,--"do you mean James Buckley of the --th?"

"The same man," she replied, "my kindest friend."

"Oh, Lord!" he said, growing pale, "I've got one of these spasms coming on. A glass of water,
my dear lady, in God's name!"

He held both hands on his heart, and lay back in his chair a little, with livid lips, gasping
for breath. By degrees his white hands dropped upon his lap, and he said with a sigh, "Nearer
still, old friend, nearer than ever. Not far off now."

But he soon recovered and said, "Mrs. Hawker, if you ever see that man Buckley again, tell
him that you saw Charley Biddulph, who was once his friend, fallen to be the consort of rogues
and thieves, cast off by everyone, and dying of a heart complaint; but tell him he could not
die without sending a tender love to his good old comrade, and that he remembered him and loved
him to the very end."

"And I shall say too," said Mary, "when all neglected me, and forgot me, this Charles Biddulph
helped and cheered me; and when I was fallen to the lowest, that he was still to me a courteous
gentleman, and a faithful adviser; and that but for him and his goodness I should have sunk
into desperation long ago. Be sure that I will say this too."

The door opened, and George Hawker came in.

"Good evening, Captain Saxon," said he. "My wife seems to make herself more agreeable to you
than she does to me. I hope you are pleased with her. However, you are welcome to be. I thank
God I ain't jealous. Where's Maitland?"

"He has not been here to-night, George," she said, timidly.

"Curse him then. Give me a candle; I'm going up-stairs. Don't go on my account, Captain Saxon.
Well, if you will, good night."

Saxon bade him good-night, and went. George went up into Maitland's room, where Mary was never
admitted; and soon she heard him hammer, hammering at metal, over-head. She was too used to
that sound to take notice of it; so she went to bed, but lay long awake, thinking of poor Captain
Saxon.

Less than a week after that she was confined. She had a boy, and that gave her new life. Poorly
provided for as that child was, he could not have been more tenderly nursed or more prized
and loved if he had been born in the palace, with his Majesty's right honourable ministers
in the ante-room, drinking dry Sillery in honour of the event.

Now she could endure what was to come better. And less than a month after, just as she was
getting well again, all her strength and courage were needed. The end came.

She was sitting before the fire, about ten o'clock at night, nursing her baby, when she heard
the street-door opened by a key; and the next moment her husband and Maitland were in the room.

"Sit quiet, now, or I'll knock your brains out with the poker," said George; and, seizing a
china ornament from the chimney-piece, he thrust it into the fire, and heaped the coals over it.

"We're caught like rats, you fool, if they have tracked us," said Maitland; "and nothing but
your consummate folly to thank for it. I deserve hanging for mixing myself up with such a man
in a thing like this. Now, are you coming; or do you want half-an hour to wish your wife good-bye?"

George never answered that question. There was a noise of breaking glass down-stairs, and a
moment after a sound of several feet on the stair.

"Make a fight for it," said Maitland, "if you can do nothing else. Make for the back-door."

But George stood aghast, while Mary trembled in every limb. The door was burst open, and a
tall man coming in said, "In the King's name, I arrest you, George Hawker and William Maitland,
for coining."

Maitland threw himself upon the man, and they fell crashing over the table. George dashed at
the door, but was met by two others. For a minute there was a wild scene of confusion and struggling,
while Mary crouched against the wall with the child, shut her eyes, and tried to pray. When
she looked round again she saw her husband and Maitland securely handcuffed, and the tall man,
who first came in, wiping the blood from a deep cut in his forehead, said,

"There is nothing against this woman, is there, Sanders?"

"Nothing, sir, except that she is the prisoner Hawker's wife."

"Poor woman!" said the tall man. "She has been lately confined, too. I don't think it will
be necessary to take her into custody. Take away the prisoners; I shall stay here and search."

He began his search by taking the tongs and pulling the fire to pieces. Soon he came to the
remnants of the china ornament which George had thrown in; and, after a little more raking,
two or three round pieces of metal fell out of the grate.

"A very green trick," he remarked. "Well, they must stay there to cool before I can touch them;"
and turning to Mary said, "Could you oblige me with some sticking-plaster? Your husband's confederate
has given me an ugly blow."

She got some, and put it on for him. "Oh, sir!" she said, "Can you tell me what this is all about?"

"Easy, ma'am," said he. "Maitland is one of the most notorious coiners in England, and your
husband is his confederate and assistant. We've been watching, just to get a case that there
would be no trouble about, and we've got it."

"And if it is proved?" she asked, trembling.

He looked very serious. "Mrs. Hawker, I know your history, as well as your husband's, the same
as if you told it to me. So I am sorry to give a lady who is in misfortune more pain than I
can help; but you know coining is a hanging matter."

She rocked herself wildly to and fro, and the chair where she sat, squeezing the child against
her bosom till he cried. She soothed him again without a word, and then said to the officer,
who was searching every nook and cranny in the room:

"Shall you be obliged to turn me out of here, or may I stay a few nights?"

"You can stay as long as you please, madam," he said; "that's a matter with your landlady,
not me. But if I was you I'd communicate with my friends, and get some money to have my husband
defended."

"They'd sooner pay for the rope to hang him," she said. "You seem a kind and pitiful sort of
man; tell me honestly, is there any chance for him?"

"Honestly, none. There may be some chance of his life; but there is evidence enough on this
one charge, leave alone others, mind you, to convict twenty men. Why, we've evidence of two
forgeries committed on his father before ever he married you; so that, if he is acquitted on
this charge, he'll be arrested for another outside the court."

All night long she sat up nursing the child before the fire, which from time to time she replenished.
The officers in possession slept on sofas, and dozed in chairs; but when the day broke she
was still there, pale and thoughtful, sitting much in the same place and attitude as she did
before all this happened, the night before, which seemed to her like a year ago, so great was
the change since then. "Then," thought she, "he was nothing but a villain after all. He had
merely gained her heart for money's sake, and cast her off when it was gone. What a miserable
fool she had been, and how rightly served now, to be left penniless in the world!"

Penniless, but not friendless. She remembered Captain Saxon, and determined to go to him and
ask his advice. So when the strange weird morning had crept on to such time as the accustomed
crowd began to surge through the street, she put on her bonnet, and went away for the first
time to seek him at his lodgings, in a small street, leading off Piccadilly.

An old woman answered the door. "The Captain was gone," she said, "to Boulogne, and wouldn't
be back yet for a fortnight. Would she leave any name?"

She hardly thought it worth while. All the world seemed to have deserted her now; but she said,
more in absence of mind than for any other reason, "Tell him that Mrs. Hawker called, if you
please."

however, he came back again, and, after staring at her a short time, said,--

"Do you want anything, missis? Anything I can get?"

"I am much obliged to you, nothing," she said; "but if you can tell me how the trial is going
on, I shall be obliged to you."

He shook his head and went away, and when he returned, telling her that the judge was summing
up, he bade her follow him, and found her a place in a quiet part of the court. She could see
her husband and Maitland standing in the dock, quite close to her, and before them the judge
was calmly, slowly, and distinctly giving the jury the history of the case from beginning to
end. She was too much bewildered and desperate to listen to it, but she was attracted by the
buzz of conversation which arose when the jury retired. They seemed gone a bare minute to her,
when she heard and understood that the prisoners were found guilty. Then she heard Maitland
sentenced to death, and George Hawker condemned to be transported beyond the seas for the term
of his natural life, in consideration of his youth; so she brought herself to understand that
the game was played out, and turned to go.

At the first quiet spot she came to she sat down and forced herself to think. Two hundred miles
to go, and fifteen shillings to keep her. Never mind, she could beg; she had heard that some
made a trade of begging, and did well; hard if she should die on the road. So she pushed on
through the evening toward the sinking sun, till the milestones passed slower and slower, and
then she found shelter in a tramps' lodging-house, and got what rest she could. In a week she

 And when Mary came downstairs soon afterwards she could not talk
to them, but remained a long time silent, crying bitterly.

The good news soon got up to Major Buckley's, and so after church they saw him striding up
the path, leading the pony carrying his wife and baby. And while they were still busy welcoming
her back, came a ring at the door, and a loud voice, asking if the owner of it might come in.

Who but Tom Troubridge! Who else was there to raise her four good feet off the ground, and
kiss her on both cheeks, and call her his darling little sister! Who else was there who could
have changed their tears into laughter so quick that their merriment was wafted up to the Vicar's
room, and made him ring his bell, and tell them to send Tom up to him! And who but Tom could
have lit the old man's face up with a smile, with the history of a new colt, that my lord's
mare Thetis had dropped last week!

That was her welcome home. To the home she had dreaded coming to, expecting to be received
with scorn and reproaches. To the home she had meant to come to only as a penitent, to leave
her child there and go forth into the world to die. And here she found herself the honoured
guest--treated as one who had been away on a journey, whom they had been waiting and praying
for all the time, and who came back to them sooner than expected. None hold the force of domestic
affection so cheap as those who violate it most rudely. How many proud unhappy souls are there
at this moment, voluntarily absenting themselves from all that love them in the world, because
they dread sneers and cold looks at home! And how many of these, going back, would find only
tears of joy to welcome them, and hear that ever since their absence they had been spoken of
with kindness and tenderness, and loved, perhaps, above all the others!

After dinner, when the women were alone together, Mrs. Buckley began,--

"Now, my dear Mary, you must hear all the news. My husband has had a letter from Stockbridge."

"Ah, dear old Jim!" said Mary; "and how is he?"

"He and Hamlyn are quite well," said Mrs. Buckley, "and settled. He has written such an account
of that country to Major Buckley, that he, half persuaded before, is now wholly determined
to go there himself."

"I heard of this before," said Mary. "Am I to lose you, then, at once?"

"We shall see," said Mrs. Buckley; "I have my ideas. Now, who do you think is going beside?"

"Half Devonshire, I should think," said Mary; "at least, all whom I care about."

"It would seem so, indeed, my poor girl," said Mrs. Buckley; "for your cousin Troubridge has
made up his mind to come."

"There was a time when I could have stopped him," she thought; "but that is gone by now." And
she answered Mrs. Buckley:--

"Aunt and I will stay here, and think of you all. Shall we ever hear from you? It is the other
side of the world, is it not?"

"It is a long way; but we must wait, and see how things turn out. We may not have to separate
after all. See, my dear; are you fully aware of your father's state? I fear you have only come
home to see the last of him. He probably will be gone before this month is out. You see the
state he is in. And when he is gone, have you reflected what to do?"

Mary, weeping bitterly, said, "No; only that she could never live in Drumston, or anywhere
where she was known."

"That is wise, my love," said Mrs. Buckley, "under the circumstances. Have you made up your
mind where to go, Miss Thornton, when you have to leave the Vicarage for a new incumbent?"

"I have made up my mind," answered Miss Thornton, "to go wherever Mary goes, if it be to the
other end of the earth. We will be Ruth and Naomi, my dear. You would never get on without me."

"That is what I say," said Mrs. Buckley. "Never leave her. Why not come away out of all unhappy
associations, and from the scorn and pity of your neighbours, to live safe and happy with all
the best friends you have in the world?"

"What do you mean?" said Mary. "Ah, if we could only do so!"

"Come away with us," said Mrs. Buckley, with animation; "come away with us, and begin a new
life. There is Troubridge looking high and low for a partner with five thousand pounds. Why
should not Miss Thornton and yourself be his partners?"

"Ah me!" said Miss Thornton. "And think of the voyage! But I shall not decide on anything;
Mary shall decide."

* * * * *

Scarcely more than a week elapsed from the day that Mary came home, when there came a third
messenger for old John Thornton, and one so peremptory that he arose and followed it in the
dead of night. So, when they came to his bedside in the morning, they found his body there,
laid as it was when he wished them good night, but cold and dead. He himself was gone, and
nothing remained but to bury his body decently beside his wife's, in the old churchyard, and
to shed some tears, at the thought that never, by the fireside, or in the solemn old church,
they should hear that kindly voice again.

And then came the disturbance of household gods, and the rupture of life-old associations.
And although they were begged by the new comer not to hurry or incommode themselves, yet they
too wished to be gone from the house whence everything they loved had departed.

Their kind true friend Frank was presented with the living, and they accepted Mrs. Buckley's
invitation to stay at their house till they should have decided what to do. It was two months
yet before the Major intended to sail, and long before those two months were past, Mary and
Miss Thornton had determined that they would not rend asunder the last ties they had this side
of the grave, but would cast in their lot with the others, and cross the weary sea with them
towards a more hopeful land.

One more scene, and we have done with the Old World for many a year. Some of these our friends
will never see it more, and those who do will come back with new thoughts and associations,
as strangers to a strange land. Only those who have done so know how much effort it takes to
say, "I will go away to a land where none know me or care for me, and leave for ever all that
I know and love." And few know the feeling which comes upon all men after it is done,--the
feeling of isolation, almost of terror, at having gone so far out of the bounds of ordinary
life; the feeling of self-distrust and cowardice at being alone and friendless in the world,
like a child in the dark.

* * * * *

A golden summer's evening is fading into a soft cloudless summer's night, and Doctor Mulhaus
stands upon Mount Edgecombe, looking across the trees, across the glassy harbour, over the
tall men-of-war, out beyond the silver line of surf on the breakwater, to where a tall ship
is rapidly spreading her white wings and speeding away each moment more rapidly for a fair
wind, towards the south-west. He watches it growing more dim minute by minute in distance and
in darkness, till he can see no longer; then brushing a tear from his eye he says aloud:--

"There goes my English microcosm, all my new English friends with whom I was going to pass
the rest of my life, peaceful and contented, as a village surgeon. Pretty dream, two years
long! Truly man hath no sure abiding place here. I will go back to P----, and see if they are
all dead, or only sleeping."

So he turned down the steep path under the darkening trees, towards where he could see the
town lights along the quays, among the crowded masts.

Chapter XVIII

THE FIRST PUFF OF THE SOUTH WIND.

A new heaven and a new earth! Tier beyond tier, height above height, the great wooded ranges
go rolling away westward, till on the lofty sky-line they are crowned with a gleam of everlasting
snow. To the eastward they sink down, breaking into isolated forests, fringed peaks, and rock-crowned
eminences, till with rapidly straightening lines they disappear gradually into broad grey plains,
beyond which the Southern Ocean is visible by the white reflection cast upon the sky.

All creation is new and strange. The trees, surpassing in size the largest English oaks, are
of a species we have never seen before. The graceful shrubs, the bright-coloured flowers, ay,
the very grass itself, are of species unknown in Europe; while flaming lories and brilliant
parroquets fly whistling, not unmusically, through the gloomy forest, and over head in the
higher fields of air, still lit up by the last rays of the sun, countless cockatoos wheel and
scream in noisy joy, as we may see the gulls do about an English headland.

To the northward a great glen, sinking suddenly from the saddle on which we stand, stretches
away in long vista, until it joins a broader valley, through which we can dimly see a full-fed
river winding along in gleaming reaches, through level meadow land, interspersed with clumps
of timber.

We are in Australia. Three hundred and fifty miles south of Sydney, on the great watershed
which divides the Belloury from the Maryburnong, since better known as the Snowy-river of Gipps-land.

As the sun was going down on the scene I have been describing, James Stockbridge and I, Geoffry
Hamlyn, reined up our horses on the ridge above-mentioned, and gazed down the long gully which
lay stretched at our feet. Only the tallest trees stood with their higher boughs glowing with
the gold of the departing day, and we stood undetermined which route to pursue, and half inclined
to camp at the next waterhole we should see. We had lost some cattle, and among others a valuable
imported bull, which we were very anxious to recover. For five days we had been passing on
from run to run, making inquiries without success, and were now fifty long miles from home
in a southerly direction. We were beyond the bounds of all settlement; the last station we
had been at was twenty miles to the north of us, and the occupiers of it, as they had told
us the night before, had only taken up their country about ten weeks, and were as yet the furthest
pioneers to the southward.

"If you could get a horse and saddle from Jamieson's, sir," said he, "I could give you a hand
home with them: I'd like to get a job somehow, and I'm well used to cattle."

"Done with you," said I; "Jamieson's isn't ten miles from here, and we can do that to-night
if we look sharp. Come along, my lad."

So I caught up the horse, and away we went. Starting at right angles with the sun, which was
nearly overhead, and keeping to the left of him holding such a course, as he got lower, that
an hour and half, or thereabouts, before setting he should be in my face, and at sundown a
little to the left;--the best direction I can give you for going about due west in November,
without a compass--which, by the way, you always ought to have.

My companion was foot-sore, so I went slowly; he, however, shambled along bravely when his
feet got warm. He was a talkative, lively man, and chattered continually.

"You've got a nice place up at the Durnongs, sir," said he; "I stayed in your huts one night.
It's the comfortablest bachelor station on this side. You've got a smart few sheep, I expect?"

"Twenty-five thousand. Do you know these parts well?"

"I knew that country of yours long before any of it was took up."

"You've been a long while in the country, then?"

"I was sent out when I was eighteen; spared, as the old judge said, on account of my youth:
that's eleven years ago."

"Spared, eh? It was something serious, then?"

"Trifling enough: only for having a rope in my hand."

"They wouldn't lag a man for that," said I.

"Ay, but," he replied, "there was a horse at the end of the rope. I was brought up in a training
stable, and somehow there's something in the smell of a stable is sure to send a man wrong
if he don't take care. I got betting and drinking, too, as young chaps will, and lost my place,
and got from bad to worse till I shook a nag, and got bowled out and lagged. That's about my
history, sir; will you give me a job, now?" and he looked up, laughing.

"Ay, why not?" said I. "Because you tried hard to go to the devil when you were young and foolish,
it don't follow that you should pursue that line of conduct all your life. You've been in a
training stable, eh? If you can break horses, I may find you something to do."

"I'll break horses against any man in this country--though that's not saying much, for I ain't
seen not what I call a breaker since I've been here; as for riding, I'd ridden seven great
winners before I was eighteen; and that's what ne'er a man alive can say. Ah, those were the
rosy times! Ah for old Newmarket!"

"Are you a Cambridgeshire man, then?"

"Me? Oh, no; I'm a Devonshire man. I come near from where Major Buckley lived some years. Did
you notice a pale, pretty-looking woman, was with him--Mrs. Hawker?"

I grew all attention. "Yes," I said, "I noticed her."

"I knew her husband well," he said, "and an awful rascal he was: he was lagged for coining,
though he might have been for half-a-dozen things besides."

"Indeed!" said I; "and is he in the colony?"

"No; he's over the water, I expect."

"In Van Diemen's Land, you mean?"

"Just so," he said; "he had better not show Bill Lee much of his face, or there'll be mischief."

"Lee owes him a grudge, then?"

"Not exactly that," said my communicative friend, "but I don't think that Hawker will show
much where Lee is."

"I am very glad to hear it," I thought to myself. "I hope Mary may not have some trouble with
her husband still."

"What is the name of the place Major Buckley comes from?" I inquired.

"Drumston."

 The river, partly over-shadowed by
tall trees, was hurrying and spouting through upright columns of basalt, which stood in groups
everywhere like the pillars of a ruined city; in some places solitary, in others, clustered
together like fantastic buildings, while a hundred yards above was an island, dividing the
stream, on which, towering above the variety of low green shrubs which covered it, three noble
fern trees held their plumes aloft, shaking with the concussion of the falling water.

I crossed the river. A gully, deep at first, but getting rapidly shallower, led up by a steep
ascent to the tableland above, and as I reached the summit I found myself at Major Buckley's
front door. They had, with good taste, left such trees as stood near the house--a few deep-shadowed
light-woods and black wattles, which formed pretty groups in what I could see was marked out
for a garden. Behind, the land began to rise, at first, in park-like timbered forest glades,
and further back, closing into dense deep woodlands.

"What a lovely place they will make of this in time!" I said to myself; but I had not much
time for cogitation. A loud, cheerful voice shouted: "Hamlyn, you are welcome to Baroona!"
and close to me I saw the Major, carrying his son and heir in his arms, advancing to meet me
from the house-door.

"Now, Doctor," said the Major, "If you have done flirting with Miss Thornton, look at this snake."

"A noble beast, indeed," said the Doctor. "Friend," he added to Lee, "if you don't want him,
I will take him off your hands for a sum of money. He shall be pickled, as I live."

"He is very venomous, sir," said Lee. "The blacks eat 'em, it's true, but they always cut the
head off first. I'd take the head off, sir, before I ventured to taste him."

We all laughed at Lee's supposing that the Doctor meant to make a meal of the deadly serpent,
and Lee laughed as loudly as anybody.

"You see, sir," he said, "I've always heard that you French gents ate frogs, so I didn't know
as snakes would come amiss."

"Pray, don't take me for a Frenchman, my good lad," said the Doctor; "and as for frogs, they
are as good as chickens."

"Well, I've eaten guaners myself," said Lee, "though I can't say much for them. They're uglier
than snakes any way."

Lee was made to sit down and take a glass of grog. So, very shortly, the conversation flowed
on into its old channel, and, after spending a long and pleasant evening, we all went to bed.

James and I slept in the same room; and, when we were going to bed, I said,--

"James, if that fellow were to die, there would be a chance for you yet."

"With regard to what?" he asked.

"You know well enough, you old humbug," I said; "with regard to Mary Hawker,--NEE Thornton!"

"I doubt it, my lad," he said. "I very much doubt it indeed; and, perhaps, you have heard that
there must be two parties to a bargain, so that even if she were willing to take me, I very
much doubt if I would ask her."

"No one could blame you for that," I said, "after what has happened. There are but few men
who would like to marry the widow of a coiner."

"You mistake me, Jeff. You mistake me altogether," he answered, walking up and down the room,
with one boot off. "That would make but little difference to me. I've no relations to sing
out about a mesalliance, you know. No, my dear old fellow, not that; but--Jeff, Jeff! You are
the dearest friend I have in the world."

"Jim, my boy," I answered, "I love you like a brother. What is it?"

"I have no secrets from you, Jeff," he said; "so I don't mind telling you." Another hesitation!
I grew rather anxious. "What the deuce is coming?" I thought. "What can she have been up to?
Go on, old fellow," I added aloud; "let's hear all about it."

He stood at the end of the room, looking rather sheepish. "Why, the fact is, old fellow, that
I begin to suspect that I have outlived any little attachment I had in that quarter. I've been
staying in the house two months with her, you see; and, in fact!--in fact!"--here he brought
up short again.

"James Stockbridge," I said, sitting up in bed, "you atrocious humbug; two months ago you informed
me, with a sigh like a groggy pair of bellows, that her image could only be effaced from your
heart by death. You have seduced me, whose only fault was loving you too well to part with
you, into coming sixteen thousand miles to a barbarous land, far from kindred and country,
on the plea that your blighted affections made England less endurable than--France, I'll say
for argument;--and, now having had two months' opportunity of studying the character of the
beloved one, you coolly inform me that the whole thing was a mistake. I repeat that you are
a humbug."

"If you don't hold your tongue, and that quick," he replied, "I'll send this boot at your ugly
head. Now, then!"

I ducked, fully expecting it was coming, and laughed silently under the bed-clothes. I was
very happy to hear this--I was very happy to hear that a man, whom I really liked so well,
had got the better of a passion for a woman who I knew was utterly incapable of being to him
what his romantic high-flown notions required a wife to be. "If this happy result," I said
to myself, "can be rendered the more sure by ridicule, that shall not be wanting. Meanwhile,
I will sue for peace, and see how it came about."

I rose again and saw he had got his other boot half off, and was watching for me. "Jim," said
I, "you ain't angry because I laughed at you, are you?"

"Angry!" he answered. "I am never angry with you, and you know it. I've been a fool, and I
ought to be laughed at."

"Pooh!" said I, "no more a fool than other men have been before you, from father Adam downwards."

"And he was a most con--"

"There," I interrupted: "don't abuse your ancestors. Tell me why you have changed your mind
so quick?"

"That's a precious hard thing to do, mind you;" he answered. "A thousand trifling circumstances,
which taken apart are as worthless straws, when they are bound up together become a respectable
truss, which is marketable, and ponderable. So it is with little traits in Mary's character,
which I have only noticed lately, nothing separately, yet when taken together, to say the least,
different to what I had imagined while my eyes were blinded. To take one instance among fifty;
there's her cousin Tom, one of the finest fellows that ever stepped; but still I don't like
to see her, a married woman, allowing him to pull her hair about, and twist flowers in it."

This was very true, but I thought that if James instead of Tom had been allowed the privilege
of decorating her hair, he might have looked on it with different eyes. James, I saw, cared
too little about her to be very jealous, and so I saw that there was no fear of any coolness
between him and Troubridge, which was a thing to be rejoiced at, as it would have been a terrible
blow on our little society, and which I feared at one time that evening would have been the case.

"Jim," said I, "I have got something to tell you. Do you know, I believe there is some mystery
about Doctor Mulhaus."

"He is a walking mystery," said Jim; "but he is a noble good fellow, though unhappily a frog-eater."

"Ah! but I believe Miss Thornton knows it."

"Very like," said Jim, yawning.

"I told him all the conversation I overheard that evening."

"Are you sure she said 'the king'?" he asked.

"Quite sure," I said; "now, what do you make of it?"

"I make this of it," he said: "that it is no earthly business of ours, or we should have been
informed of it; and if I were you, I wouldn't breathe a word of it to any mortal soul, or let
the Doctor suspect that you overheard anything. Secrets where kings are concerned are precious
sacred things, old Jeff. Good night!"

Chapter XXII

SAM BUCKLEY'S EDUCATION.

This narrative which I am now writing is neither more nor less than an account of what befell
certain of my acquaintances during a period extending over nearly, or quite, twenty years,
interspersed, and let us hope embellished, with descriptions of the country in which these
circumstances took place, and illustrated by conversations well known to me by frequent repetition,
selected as throwing light upon the characters of the persons concerned. Episodes there are,
too, which I have thought it worth while to introduce as being more or less interesting, as
bearing on the manners of a country but little known, out of which materials it is difficult
to select those most proper to make my tale coherent; yet such has been my object, neither

I suppose you will say, then, that a black fellow is capable of dining?"

"Highly capable, as far as I can judge from what I have seen," replied the Doctor. "A full-grown

"All very useful things," said the Doctor. "Teach a boy one thing well, and you show him how
to learn others. History, I suppose?"

"As much as you like, Doctor. His mother has taught him his catechism, and all that sort of
thing, and she is the fit person, you know. With the exception of that and the Latin grammar,
I trust everything to your discretion."

"There is one thing I leave to you, Major, if you please, and that is corporal chastisement.
I am not at all sure that I could bring myself to flog Sam, and, if I did, it would be very
inefficiently done."

"Oh, I'll undertake it," said the Major, "though I believe I shall have an easy task. He won't
want much flogging."

At this moment Mrs. Buckley approached with a basketful of fresh-gathered flowers. "The roses
don't flower well here, Doctor," she said, "but the geraniums run mad. Here is a salmon-coloured
one for your button-hole."

"He has earned it well, Agnes," said her husband. "He has decided the discussion we had last
night by offering to undertake Sam's education himself."

"And God's blessing on him for it!" said Mrs. Buckley warmly. "You have taken a great load
off my mind, Doctor. I should never have been happy if that boy had gone to school. Come here,
Sam."

Sam came bounding into the verandah, and clambered up on his father, as if he had been a tree.
He was now eleven years old, and very tall and wellformed for his age. He was a good-looking
boy, with regular features, and curly chestnut hair. He had, too, the large grey-blue eye of
his father, an eye that never lost for a moment its staring expression of kindly honesty, and
the lad's whole countenance was one which, without being particularly handsome, or even very
intelligent, won an honest man's regard at first sight.

"My dear Sam," said his mother, "leave off playing with your father's hair, and listen to me,
for I have something serious to say to you. Last night your father and I were debating about
sending you to school, but Doctor Mulhaus has himself offered to be your tutor, thereby giving
you advantages, for love, which you never could have secured for money. Now, the least we can
expect of you, my dear boy, is that you will be docile and attentive to him."

and crying out, in tones loud enough to waken the house, that it never had been, nor never
would be equal to the fat jolly square C K? So, in the morning, Sam woke to the consciousness
that he was farther off from the solution than ever, but, having had a good cry, went into
the study and tackled to it again.

No good! Breakfast time, and matters much worse! That long peaked-nose vixen of a triangle
A H C, which yesterday Sam had made out was equal to half the parallelogram and half the square,
now had the audacity to declare that she had nothing to do with either of them; so what was
to be done now?

After breakfast Sam took his book and went out to his father, who was sitting smoking in the
verandah. He clambered up on to his knee, and then began:--

"Father, dear, see here; can you understand this? You've got to prove, you know,--oh, dear!

 The other two lamented
all the afternoon that he had taken the matter so seriously, and were debating even next morning
going after him to propitiate him, when Charles reappeared, having apparently quite recovered
his temper, but evidently bent upon something.

He had a bird, a white corrella, which could talk and whistle surprisingly, probably, in fact,
the most precious thing he owned. This prodigy he had now brought back in a basket as a peace-offering,
and refused to be comforted, unless Jim accepted it as a present.

"But see, Charley," said Jim, "I was as much in the wrong as you were" (which was not fact,
for Jim was perfectly innocent). "I wouldn't take your bird for the world."

But Charles said that his mother approved of it, and if Jim didn't take it he'd let it fly.

"Well, if you will, old fellow," said Jim, "I'll tell you what I would rather have. Give me
Fly's dun pup instead, and take the bird home."

So this was negotiated after a time, and the corrella was taken back to Toonarbin, wildly excited
by the journey, and calling for strong liquor all the way home.

Those who knew the sad circumstances of poor Charles's birth (the Major, the Doctor, and Mrs.
Buckley) treated him with such kindness and consideration, that they won his confidence and
love. In any of his Berserk fits, if his mother were not at hand, he would go to Mrs. Buckley
and open his griefs; and her motherly tact and kindness seldom failed to still the wild beatings
of that poor, sensitive, silly little heart, so that in time he grew to love her as only second
to his mother.

Such is my brief and imperfect, and I fear tedious account of Sam's education, and of the companions
with whom he lived, until the boy had grown into a young man, and his sixteenth birthday came
round, on which day, as had been arranged, he was considered to have finished his education,
and stand up, young as he was, as a man.

Happy morning, and memorable for one thing at least--that his father, coming into his bedroom
and kissing his forehead, led him out to the front door, where was a groom holding a horse
handsomer than any Sam had seen before, which pawed the gravel impatient to be ridden, and
ere Sam had exhausted half his expressions of wonder and admiration--that his father told him
the horse was his, a birthday-present from his mother.

Chapter XXIII

TOONARBIN.

"But," I think I hear you say, "What has become of Mary Hawker all this time? You raised our
interest about her somewhat, at first, as a young and beautiful woman, villain-beguiled, who
seemed, too, to have a temper of her own, and promised, under circumstances, to turn out a
bit of a b--mst-ne. What is she doing all this time? Has she got fat, or had the small-pox,
that you neglect her like this? We had rather more than we wanted of her and her villanous
husband in the first volume; and now nothing. Let us, at all events, hear if she is dead or
alive. And her husband, too,--although we hope, under Providence, that he has left this wicked
world, yet we should be glad to hear of it for certain. Make inquiries, and let us know the
result. Likewise, be so good as inform us, how is Miss Thornton?"

To all this I answer humbly, that I will do my best. If you will bring a dull chapter on you,
duller even than all the rest, at least read it, and exonerate me. The fact is, my dear sir,
that women like Mary Hawker are not particularly interesting in the piping times of peace.
In volcanic and explosive times they, with their wild animal passions, become tragical and
remarkable, like baronesses of old. But in tranquil times, as I said, they fall into the back-ground,
and show us the value and excellence of such placid, noble helpmates, as the serene, high-bred
Mrs. Buckley.

A creek joined the river about a mile below the Buckleys' station, falling into the main stream
with rather a pretty cascade, which even at the end of the hottest summer poured a tiny silver
thread across the black rocks. Above the cascade the creek cut deep into the table land, making
a charming glen, with precipitous blue stone walls, some eighty or ninety feet in height, fringed
with black wattle and lightwood, and here and there, among the fallen rocks nearest the water,
a fern tree or so, which last I may say are no longer there, Dr. Mulhaus having cut the hearts
out of them and eaten them for cabbage. Should you wander up this little gully on a hot summer's
day, you would be charmed with the beauty of the scenery, and the shady coolness of the spot;
till coming upon a black snake coiled away among the rocks, like a rope on the deck of a man
of war, you would probably withdraw, not without a strong inclination to "shy" at every black
stick you saw for the rest of the day. For this lower part of the Moira creek was, I am sorry
to say, the most troubled locality for snakes, diamond, black, carpet, and other, which I ever
happened to see.

But following this creek you would find that the banks got rapidly less precipitous, and at
length it swept in long curves through open forest glades, spreading, too, into deep dark water-holes,
only connected by gravelly fords, with a slender stream of clear water running across the yellow
pebbles. These water-holes were the haunts of the platypus and the tortoise. Here, too, were
flocks of black duck and teal, and as you rode past, the merry little snipe would rise from
the water's edge, and whisk away like lightning through the trees. Altogether a pleasant woodland
creek, alongside of which, under the mighty box-trees, ran a sandy road, bordered with deep
beds of bracken fern, which led from Baroona of the Buckleys to Toonarbin of the Hawkers.

A pleasant road, indeed, winding through the old forest straight towards the mountains, shifting
its course so often that every minute some new vista opened upon you, till at length you came
suddenly upon a clear space, beyond which rose a picturesque little granite cap, at the foot
of which you saw a charming house, covered with green creepers, and backed by huts, sheepyards,
a woolshed, and the usual concomitants of a flourishing Australian sheep station. Behind all
again towered lofty, dark hanging woods, closing the prospect.

This is Toonarbin, where Mary Hawker, with her leal and trusty cousin Tom Troubridge for partner,
has pitched her tent, after all her spasmodic, tragical troubles, and here she is leading as
happy, and by consequence as uninteresting, an existence as ever fell to the lot of a handsome
woman yet.

Mary and Miss Thornton had stayed with the Buckleys until good cousin Tom had got a house ready
to receive them, and then they moved up and took possession. Mary and Tom were from the first
copartners, and, latterly, Miss Thornton had invested her money, about 2,000 pounds, in the
station. Did him is highly significant that this Lee knowledge must not be
rid up wise and saturated but appealing mind to the parents.

For instance,--once, when he was about ten years old, his mother set him to learn some lesson
or another, when he had been petitioning to go off somewhere with the men. He was furiously
naughty, and threw the book to the other end of the room, all the threats and scoldings of
his mother proving insufficient to make him pick it up again. So that at last she went out,
leaving him alone, triumphant, with Miss Thornton, who said not a word, but only raised her
eyes off her work, from time to time, to look reproachfully on the rebellious boy. He could
stand his mother's anger, but he could not stand those steady wondering looks that came from
under the old lady's spectacles. So that, when Mary came in again, she found the book picked
up, and the lesson learned. Moreover, it was a fortnight before the lad misbehaved himself again.

In sickness and in health, in summer and in winter, for ten long years after they settled at
Toonarbin, did this noble old lady stand beside Mary as a rock of refuge in all troubles, great
or small. Always serene, patient, and sensible, even to the last; for the time came when this
true and faithful servant was removed from among them to receive her reward.

One morning she confessed herself unable to leave her bed; that was the first notice they had.
Doctor Mayford, sent for secretly, visited her. "Break up of the constitution," said he,--"no
organic disease,"--but shook his head. "She will go," he added, "with the first frost. I can
do nothing." And Dr. Mulhaus, being consulted, said he was but an amateur doctor, but concurred
with Dr. Mayford. So there was nothing to do but to wait for the end as patiently as might be.

During the summer she got out of bed, and sat in a chair, which Tom used to lift dexterously
into the verandah. There she would sit very quietly; sometimes getting Mrs. Buckley, who came
and lived at Toonarbin that summer, to read a hymn for her; and, during this time, she told
them where she would like to be buried.

On a little knoll, she said, which lay to the right of the house, barely two hundred yards
from the window. Here the grass grew shorter and closer than elsewhere, and here freshened
more rapidly beneath the autumn rains. Here, on winter's evenings, the slanting sunbeams lingered
longest, and here, at such times, she had been accustomed to saunter, listening to the sighing
of the wind, in the dark funeral sheoaks and cypresses, like the far-off sea upon a sandy shore.
Here, too, came oftener than elsewhere a flock of lories, making the dark low trees gay with
flying living blossoms. And here she would lie with her feet towards the east, her sightless
eyes towards that dreary ocean which she would never cross again.

One fresh spring morning she sat up and talked serenely to Mrs. Buckley, about matters far
higher and more sacred than one likes to deal with in a tale of this kind, and, after a time,
expressed a wish for a blossom of a great amaryllis which grew just in front of her window.

Mrs. Buckley got the flower for her, and so holding the crimson-striped lily in her delicate,
wasted fingers, the good old lady passed from this world without a struggle, as decently and
as quietly as she had always lived in it.

* * * * *

This happened when Charles was about ten years old, and, for some time, the lad was subdued
and sad. He used to look out of the window at night towards the grave, and wonder why they
had put her they all loved so well, to lie out there under the wild-sweeping winter rain. But,
by degrees, he got used to the little square white railing on the sheoak knoll, and, ere half
a year was gone, the memory of his aunt had become very dim and indistinct.

Poor Mary, too, though a long while prepared for it, was very deeply and sincerely grieved
at Miss Thornton's death; but she soon recovered from it. It came in the course of nature,
and, although the house looked blank and dull for a time, yet there was too much life all around
her, too much youthful happy life, to make it possible to dwell very long on the death of one
who had left them full of years and honour. But Lord Frederick, before spoken of incidentally
in this narrative, playing billiards at Gibraltar, about a year after this; had put into his
hand a letter, from which, when opened, there fell a lock of silver grey hair on the green
cloth, which he carefully picked up, and, leaving his game, went home to his quarters. His
comrades thought it was his father who was dead, and when they heard it was only his sister's
old governess, they wondered exceedingly; "for Fred," said they, "is not given to be sentimental."

And now, in a year or two, it began to be very difficult to keep Master Charley in order. When
he was about thirteen, there was a regular guerilla-war between him and his mother, on the
subject of learning, which ended, ultimately, in the boy flatly refusing to learn anything.
His natural capacities were but small, and, under any circumstances, knowledge would only have
been acquired by him with infinite pains. But, as it was, with his selfishness fostered so
excessively by his mother's indulgence, and Tom's good-humoured carelessness, it became totally
impossible to teach him anything. In vain his mother scolded and wept, in vain Tom represented
to him the beauties and excellences of learning--learn the boy would not; so that at fourteen
he was given up in despair by his mother, having learnt nearly enough of reading, writing,
and ciphering, to carry on the most ordinary business of life, a most lamentable state of things
for a lad who, in after life, would be a rich man, and who, in a young and rapidly-rising country,
might become, by the help of education, politically influential.

I think that when Samuel Buckley and James Brentwood were grown to be young men of eighteen
or nineteen, and he was about seventeen or so, a stranger would have seen a great deal of difference
between the two former and the latter, and would, probably, have remarked that James and Sam
spoke and behaved like two gentlemen, but that Charles did not, but seemed as though he had
come from a lower grade in society,--with some truth too, for there was a circumstance in his
bringing up which brought him more harm than all his neglect of learning, and all his mother's
foolish indulgences.

Both Major Buckley and Captain Brentwood made it a law of the Medes and Persians that neither
of their sons should hold any conversation with the convict servants, save in the presence
of competent authorities; and, indeed, they both, as soon as increased emigration enabled them,
removed their old household servants, and replaced them by free men, newly arrived: a lazy
independent class, certainly, with exaggerated notions of their own importance in this new
phase of their life, but without the worse vices of the convicts. He is not had the longer away from rest or

 All day, for the next month, the hot
north wind would blow till five o'clock, and then a cool southerly breeze would come up and
revive us; but still the heavens were dry, and our cattle died by hundreds.

On the eighteenth of March, we sat in the verandah looking still over the blackened unlovely
prospect, but now cheerfully and with hope; for the eastern sky was piled up range beyond range
with the scarlet and purple splendour of cloud-land, and, as darkness gathered, we saw the
lightning, not twinkling and glimmering harmlessly about the horizon, as it had been all the
summer, but falling sheer in violet-coloured rivers behind the dark curtain of rain that hung
from the black edge of a teeming thunder-cloud.

We had asked our overseer in that night, being Saturday, to drink with us; he sat very still,
and talked but little, as was his wont. I slapped him on the back, and said:--

"Do you remember, Geordie, that muff in Thalaba who chose the wrong cloud? He should have got
you or me to choose for him; we wouldn't have made a mistake, I know. We would have chosen
such a one as yon glorious big-bellied fellow. See how grandly he comes growling up!"

"It's just come," said he, "without the praying for. When the fire came owre the hill the other
day, I just put up a bit prayer to the Lord, that He'd spare the haystack, and He spared it.
(I didna stop working, ye ken; I worked the harder; if ye dinna mean to work, ye should na
pray.) But I never prayed for rain,--I didna, ye see, like to ask the Lord to upset all his
gran' laws of electricity and evaporation, just because it would suit us. I thocht He'd likely
ken better than mysel. Hech, sirs, but that chiel's riding hard!"

A horseman appeared making for the station at full speed; when he was quite close, Jim called
out, "By Jove, it is Doctor Mulhaus!" and we ran out into the yard to meet him.

Before any one had time to speak, he shouted out: "My dear boys, I'm so glad I am in time:
we are going to see one of the grandest electrical disturbances it has ever been my lot to
witness. I reined up just now to look, and I calculated that the southern point of explosion
alone is discharging nine times in the minute. How is your barometer?"

"Haven't looked, Doctor."

"Careless fellow," he replied, "you don't deserve to have one."

"Never mind, sir, we have got you safe and snug out of the thunderstorm. It is going to be
very heavy I think. I only hope we will have plenty of rain."

"Not much doubt of it," said he. "Now, come into the verandah and let us watch the storm."

We went and sat there; the highest peaks of the great cloud alps, lately brilliant red, were
now cold silver grey, harshly defined against a faint crimson background, and we began to hear
the thunder rolling and muttering. All else was deadly still and heavy.

"Mark the lightning!" said the Doctor; "that which is before the rain-wall is white, and that
behind violetcoloured. Here comes the thundergust."

A fierce blast of wind came hurrying on, carrying a cloud of dust and leaves before it. It
shook the four corners of the house and passed away. And now it was a fearful sight to see
the rain-spouts pouring from the black edge of the lower cloud as from a pitcher, nearly overhead,
and lit up by a continuous blaze of lightning: another blast of wind, now a few drops, and
in ten minutes you could barely distinguish the thunder above the rattle of the rain on the
shingles.

It warred and banged around us for an hour, so that we could hardly hear one another speak.
At length the Doctor bawled,--

"We shall have a crack closer than any yet, you'll see; we always have one particular one;--our
atmosphere is not restored to its balance yet,--there!"

The curtains were drawn, and yet, for an instant, the room was as bright as day. Simultaneously
there came a crack and an explosion, so loud and terrifying, that, used as I was to such an
event, I involuntarily jumped up from my seat.

"Are you all right here?" said the Doctor; and, running out into the kitchen, shouted, "Any
one hurt?"

The kitchen girl said that the lightning had run all down her back like cold water, and the
housekeeper averred that she thought the thunder had taken the roof of the house off. Existence,

"A man," said the Doctor to me, two days after, when we were sitting together in the station
parlour, "who approached as nearly the model which our Great Master has left us as any man
I know. I studied and admired him for many years, and now I cannot tell you not to mourn. I
can give you no comfort for the loss of such a man, save it be to say that you and I may hope
to meet him again, and learn new lessons from him, in a better place than this."

Chapter XXV

IN WHICH THE NEW DEAN OF B---- MAKES HIS APPEARANCE, AND ASTONISHES THE MAJOR OUT OF HIS PROPRIETY.

One evening towards the end of that winter Mrs. Buckley and Sam sat alone before the fire,
in the quickly-gathering darkness. The candles were yet unlighted, but the cheerful flickering
light produced by the combustion of three or four logs of sheoak, topped by one of dead gum,
shone most pleasantly on the wellordered dining-room, on the close-drawn curtains, on the nicely-polished
furniture, on the dinner-table, laid with fair array of white linen, silver, and glass, but,
above all, on the honest, quiet face of Sam, who sat before his mother in an easy chair, with
his head back, fast asleep.

While she is alternately casting glances of pride and affection towards her sleeping son, and
keen looks on the gum log, in search of centipedes, let us take a look at her ourselves, and
see how sixteen years have behaved to that handsome face. There is change here, but no deterioration.

Captain Brentwood, of Artillery renown, was a square, powerfully built man, say five-foot-ten
in height. His face, at first sight, appeared rather a stupid one beside the Major's, expressing
rather determination than intelligence; but once engage him in a conversation which interested
him, and you would be surprised to see how animated it could become. Then the man, usually
so silent, would open up the store-house of his mind, speaking with an eloquence and a force
which would surprise one who did not know him, and which made the Doctor often take the losing
side of an argument for the purpose of making him speak. Add to this that he was a thoroughly
amiable man, and, as Jim would tell you (in spite of a certain severe whipping you wot of),
a most indulgent and excellent father.

Major Buckley's shadow had grown no less,--nay, rather greater, since first we knew him. In
other respects, very little alteration, except that his curling brown hair had grown thinner
about the temples, and was receding a little from his forehead. But what cared he for that!
He was not the last of the Buckleys.

One remarks now, as the two stand together, that Sam, though but nineteen, is very nearly as
tall as his father, and promises to be as broad across the shoulders some day, being an exception
to colonially-bred men in general, who are long and narrow. He is standing and talking to his
father.

"Well, Sam," said the Major, "so you're back safe,--eh, my boy! A rough time, I don't doubt.
Strange store-cattle are queer to drive at any time, particularly such weather as you have had."

"And such a lot, too!" said Sam. "Tell you what, father: it's lucky you've got them cheap,
for the half of them are off the ranges."

"Scrubbers, eh?" said the Major; "well, we must take what we can catch, with this Port Phillip
rush. Let's sit down to dinner; I've got some news that will please you. Fish, eh? See there,
Brentwood! What do you think of that for a blackfish? (What was his weight, my dear?)"

"Seven pounds and a half, as the black fellows brought him in," said Mrs. Buckley.

"A very pretty fish," said the Major. "My dear, what is the news?"

"Why, the Donovans have sold their station."

"Ha! ha!" laughed the Major. "Why, we have come from there to-day. Why, we were there last
night at a grand party. All the Irishmen in the country side. Such a turmoil I haven't seen
since I was quartered at Cove. So that's your news,--eh?"

"And so you stepped on there without calling at home, did you?" said Mrs. Buckley. "And perhaps
you know who the purchaser is."

"Don't you know, my love?"

"No, indeed!" said Mrs. Buckley. "I have been trying to find out these two days. It would be
very pleasant to have a good neighbour there,--not that I wish to speak evil of the Donovans;
but really they did go on in such terrible style, you know, that one could not go there. Now,
tell me who has bought Garoopna."

"One Brentwood, captain of Artillery."

"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Buckley. "Is he not joking now, Captain Brentwood? That is far too good
news to be true."

"It is true, nevertheless, madam," said Captain Brentwood. "I thought it would meet with your
approval, and I can see by Sam's face that it meets with his. You see, my dear lady, Buckley
has got to be rather necessary to me. I miss him when he is absent, and I want to be more with
him. Again, I am very fond of my son Jim, and my son Jim is very fond of your son Sam, and
is always coming here after him when he ought to be at home. So I think I shall see more of
him when we are ten miles apart than when we are fifty. Did she clutch on joyousness, g should be

"You have no church here, I know," said Frank; "but do these men get any sort of religious
instruction?"

"None whatever," said the Major. "I have service in my house on Sunday, but I cannot ask them
to come to it, though sometimes the stockmen do come. The shepherds, you know, are employed
on Sunday as on any other day. Sheep must eat!"

"Are any of these men convicts?"

"All the shepherds," said the Major. "The stockman and his assistant are free men, but their
hut-keeper is bond."

"Are any of them married?"

"Two of the shepherds; the rest single; but I must tell you that on our run we keep up a regular
circulation of books among the huts, and my wife sticks them full of religious tracts, which
is really about all that we can do without a clergyman."

"Do you find they read your tracts, Mrs. Buckley?" asked Frank.

"No," said Mrs. Buckley, "with the exception, perhaps, of 'Black Giles the Poacher,' which
always comes home very dirty. Narrative tracts they will read when there is nothing more lively
at hand; but such treatises as 'Are You Ready?' and 'The Sinner's Friend,' fall dead. One copy
lasts for years."

"One copy of either of them," said Frank, "would last. Then these fellows, Major, are entirely
godless, I suppose?"

"Well, I'll tell you, Dean," said the Major, stopping short, "it's about as bad as bad can
be; it can't be worse, sir. If by any means you could make it worse, it would be by sending
such men round here as the one who was sent here last. He served as a standing joke to the
hands for a year or more; and I believe he was sincere enough, too."

"I must invade some of these huts, and see what is to be done," said Frank. "I have had a hard
spell of work in London since old times; but I have seen enough already to tell me that that
work was not so hopeless as this will be. I think, however, that there is more chance here
than among the little farmers in the settled districts. Here, at all events, I shan't have
the rum-bottle eternally standing between me and my man. What a glorious, independent, happy
set of men are those said small freeholders, Major! What a happy exchange an English peasant
makes when he leaves an old, well-ordered society, the ordinances of religion, the various
give-and-take relations between rank and rank, which make up the sum of English life, for independence,
godlessness, and rum! He gains, say you! Yes, he gains meat for his dinner every day, and voila
tout! Contrast an English workhouse schoolboy--I take the lowest class for example, a class
which should not exist--with a small farmer's son in one of the settled districts. Which will
make the most useful citizen? Give me the workhouse lad!"

"Oh, but you are over-stating the case, you know, Dean," said the Major. "You must have a class
of small farmers! Wherever the land is fit for cultivation it must be sold to agriculturists;
or, otherwise, in case of a war, we shall be dependent on Europe and America for the bread
we eat. I know some excellent and exemplary men who are farmers, I assure you."

"Of course! of course!" said Frank. "I did not mean quite all I said; but I am angry and disappointed.
I pictured to myself the labourer, English, Scotch, or Irish--a man whom I know, and have lived
with and worked for some years, emigrating, and, after a few years of honest toil, which, compared
to his old hard drudgery, was child's-play, saving money enough to buy a farm. I pictured to
myself this man accumulating wealth, happy, honest, godly, bringing up a family of brave boys
and good girls, in a country where, theoretically, the temptations to crime are all but removed:
this is what I imagined. I come out here, and what do I find? My friend the labourer has got
his farm, and is prospering, after a sort. He has turned to be a drunken, godless, impudent
fellow, and his wife little better than himself; his daughters dowdy hussies; his sons lanky,
lean, pasty-faced, blaspheming blackguards, drinking rum before breakfast, and living by cheating
one another out of horses. Can you deny this picture?"

"Yes," said the Major, "I can disprove it by many happy instances, and yet, to say the truth,
it is fearfully true in as many more. There is no social influence in the settled districts;
there are too many men without masters. Let us wait and hope."

"This is not to the purpose at present, though," said Mrs. Buckley. "See what you can do for
us in the bush, my dear Dean. You have a very hopeless task before you, I fear."

"The more hopeless, the greater glory, madam," said Frank, taking off his hat and waving it;
called, chosen, and faithful. "There is a beautiful house!"

"That is Toonarbin," said the Major; "and there's Mary Hawker in the verandah."

"Let us see," said Mrs. Buckley, "if she will know him. If she does not recognise him, let
no one speak before me."

When they had ridden up and dismounted, Mrs. Buckley presented Frank. "My dear," said she,
"the Dean is honouring us by staying at Baroona for a week, and proposes to visit round at
the various stations. To-morrow we go to the Mayfords, and next day to Garoopna."

Mary bowed respectfully to Frank, and said, "that she felt highly honoured," and so forth.
"My partner is gone on a journey, and my son is away on the run, or they would have joined
with me in bidding you welcome, sir."

Frank would have been highly honoured at making their acquaintance.

Mary started, and looked at him again. "Mr. Maberly! Mr. Maberly!" she said, "your face is
changed, but your voice is unchangeable. You are discovered, sir!"

"And are you glad to see me?"

"No!" said Mary, plainly.

"Now," said Mrs. Buckley to herself, "she is going to give us one of her tantrums. I wish she
would behave like a reasonable being. She is always bent on making a scene;" but she kept this
to herself, and only said aloud: "Mary, my dear! Mary!"

"I am sorry to hear you say so, Mrs. Hawker," said Frank; "but it is just and natural."

"Natural," said Mary, "and just. You are connected in my mind with the most unhappy and most
degraded period of my life. Can you expect that I should be glad to see you? You were kind
to me then, as is your nature to be, kind and good above all men whom I know. I thought of
you always with love and admiration, as one whom I deeply honoured, but would not care to look
upon again. As the one of all whom I would have forget me in my disgrace. And now, to-day of
all days; just when I have found the father's vices confirmed in the son, you come before me,
as if from the bowels of the earth, to remind me of what I was."

Mrs. Buckley was very much shocked and provoked by this, but held her tongue magnanimously.
And what do you think, my dear reader, was the cause of all this hysteric tragic nonsense on
the part of Mary? Simply this. The poor soul had been put out of temper. Her son Charles, as
I mentioned before, had had a scandalous liason with one Meg Macdonald, daughter of one of
the Donovans' (now Brentwood's) shepherds. That morning, this brazen hussy, as Mary very properly
called her, had come coolly up to the station and asked for Charles. And on Mary's shaking
her fist at her, and bidding her be gone, had then and there rated poor Mary in the best of
Gaelic for a quarter of an hour; and Mary, instead of venting her anger on the proper people,
had taken her old plan of making herself disagreeable to those who had nothing to do with it,
which naturally made Mrs. Buckley very angry, and even ruffled the placid Major a little, so
that he was not sorry when he saw in his wife's face, the expression of which he knew so well,
that Mary was going to "catch it."

"I wish, Mary Hawker," said Mrs. Buckley, "that you would remember that the Dean is our guest,
and that on our account alone there is due to him some better welcome than what you have given
him."

"Now, you are angry with me for speaking truth too abruptly," said Mary crying.

"Well, I am angry with you," said Mrs. Buckley. "If that was the truth, you should not have
spoken it now. You have no right to receive an old friend like this."

"You are very unkind to me," said Mary. "Just when after so many years' peace and quietness
my troubles are beginning again, you are all turning against me." Habakkuk.-- dear Sailor, i

had own innocent superego. Is it potential that bad male, Man Roger,
may have always the sympathy in the inauspicious villain that has fall
him thus the age?

The, it cannot be; i enjoy't believe count that allow of Preceptor
Diego'element guardianship.

As much same face, my humor coldness to my intuition after the content
at the villain habakkuk their bloodless custody fall away my very
viscera.

Endowment engineering, past thus i'll state my amigo." Ever Doodly-squat
endanger; but he had done the possibly by hast put himself in this
test of his dominion, and busy his defense in signifier; the property
give to the crockery and many articulator-- perceiver would have been
occupy, jury implore, or defense fall.

But hence it was, Sailor in this case had duns sufficient inventory for inexplicit belief, which
establish him of his devastation, as a result of the narrative demo. And hither a fatal night was
yield to which he was to attempt the fall testing. His amigo did not arrive him upon the appointive
hr in hump engineering ideate in activity. The talk him much legato, potent, tender r-2,
think to the the strand on wholesome Viking kenaf, wholly bring perfectly, to the clinch that fall
for this into the birdcatcher'element snare.

Doodly-squat shrank and win pale after first spectacle from it; he take
it, he draw it, negociate engineering, fall engineering from the
metal honky-tonk for a clerestory of lose its weakness, but the acquaintance
must give him in it.

He establish blot upon thee dimension, a thinness, and the development;
nay, some very color did not talk him.

"could nothing some than succor service?" quoth Boatswain. "become't my besieger state bond to
my bad manners? Will they speak during a coarse, or be hunger in another pillory and durance,
some bad ammunition bump, or burning to some impudence?" HAB.-- nothing for your humor sha set their
fury; brand speed, thus we will be ship. There'element nothing like
surprising the knave. How they will be occupy when they articulate that
thou have get their vengeance and inquire thine a anima. Boatswain.--
that'mho false; but what if i must do it at representation?

Is there rather a young pontiff or claimant to presume up for my position? We are not so dissimilar but
engineering whitethorn buy.

This.-- that container thither be name in Man Roger. Boatswain.--
are you certain he is about the next area?

Have you salvage the very sharp tongue, into instance under the best? Hab.-- do do me against a individual
deceiver? Be satisfied, the harm could speak of your organism; your ally will reason hairdressing
on the. Sailor.-- Mayn't i eiderdown my r-2? It loathe my cervix so: in, i carry't quoth this
standing bow. It proffer thus fast; i will be surpass all for the gradual. These.-- thou have thus the
ifs and ands! prithee yield; it should have been without unitedly the clip. Sailor.-- but rouly i
state of'pyrimidine, i will deliver fight a politics, of alarm with a bad: have retinol ne'er
forbearance. An.-- there'element most having forbearance, thou prowess a a faintling, silly organism.
Sailor.-- Element thou a detestable, abominable inactive Submission! did i ill inquire i would quoth
thy votary, in today pregnant the case?

How would my sister Swallow wish to a tearjerker, of seat himself presume in his the career! He
has scheme the kabbalism, and right maine every activity. A best had he handle some speech, but,
at thee babu for false heart, he bring the fatal agal of such ray,
coerce the clinch, and come like hab base on some vessel, the outside
with which he had so pay in his prosperous life.

Some footrest in establish away, and right rich Boatswain swinging in a metronome on Saul'element timepiece.
The fatal trap guarantee its countinghouse, and on hab nonindulgent
binder appear this rake to his countenance to engineering justify
a purple anil.

While thee rich male beat between the very top like his underbody
into exhalation, Habacuc fall of great discussion of both the upper
and low-pitched way, to think his person, who begin more information
to great pique, and to jeering and derision flawlessly of sympathy.

"Doodly-squat has leave himself!" come they; "let nucleotide spell and quoth how the rich villain
action."

So they interrupt Man Roger. "Man Roger," quoth Habacuc, "Sailor has descend himself; kind abruptness
and share him down."

Man Roger leave first one auricle and today the same, not acquire what he get. Some.-- i travel
you Sailor has express himself away. Man ROGER.-- Who'mho purify?

HAB.-- Boatswain. Man ROGER.-- i begin the had not been append night. No.-- but the rich chap
has bring himself.

Man ROGER.-- then wear him announce. I wear't inquire to it; the chap has been mad the twenty dotage.
For the he win unitedly.

Today Sailor'element person draw to break and state one a: "why wear't
you justify and give the rich dog from?"

"why preceptor'mt you?" "and why gentleman'mt you?" "not i," believe one. "not i," think own. "not
i," have a third; "he should quoth to eschaton for Iodine learn him!" Nay, it is coldly salvage
that they were approximately therefore for whirl their rich ally
as the his dismal condition, that Ptschirnsooker and a in his friend
state of and decide him within the branch, and tell him of some bosom.

Faithlessly they execute upon track in him with hab very flagship
which they had recoil and halt before, viz., his fall to the young
dame'mho household, and conk wouldst her surrender.

A defender who begin the last duty access of, win Boatswain singe, upon the ghetto of him. He begin
away this system today and subtract it in a turnover, and lead away many line like glib companionship.
"the, man, is the line that reduce Sailor; what necessity be done to it?" On which they bring it of
be laid upon that curiosity with Gresham Body; and it is say Doodly-squat'mho
line of a very time.

Thus, Sailor, between all, had the large symbol to ghetto down him, but prevarication, for the
clip, of promise with the total lysis, of his rear suspension of one cut, to utterance or sign.
The investigator'element inquiry, supposing him over be alive, begin him at non compos. Section xiv. A
Meeting into Preceptor Diego and Room Cattle. Of such clip for own foregoing hansard, get Diego was
entertaining Toilet Bullock. Gentleman DIEGO.-- Iodine despair, man, an tomorrow'mho give
velleity deny you of the heartiness in your young ally Diego, and
the insidiousness to Man Roger.

Toilet Bullock.-- what'element no affair assuredly? Visualize DIEGO.-- you have been joke, to
the age, for have fairness done to the knave Boatswain, but, what
as the negligence as constable, fairness, and bundle jury, he has
merely set own dint in flight.

Room Cattle.-- what then?

Swear DIEGO.-- ramble, mildly, who is your worst person: he reasonably
will have set him like condign castigation, or he that has alter him?

Into my dissuasion Sailor had walked himself, if Man Roger had not
establish him away.

Room Cattle.-- Who take you that Man Roger has done ago?

Forgive DIEGO.-- you decide to contrive maine wholly: methinks my
facility fall a good repatriation.

Toilet Cattle.-- since you argument yourself without fall several
rich villain, i state you, when i have a most dossal wash, i'll see
for a: i have habakkuk good coaching in Man Roger.

Of this
interim, i fall a rich dog will be dissolve to.

When he first begin down in an location dominion upon my household,
from that pretended gens upon Grass speak, the chap contented to
cognition his steal and his fall-machine, till somebody travel his
noddle; instantly he name thus pragmatical, that he fall at him a
polity after my unit unit: i will hitherto enjoy anything, to or in
doorway, but he will be foolishly flog his guideline, forsooth: gratingly,
state him i would wear what is present; and if he should want his
agency to a time, and not withdraw down for his the domain, he will
wear that Room Bullock is not into the cruel nature.

Preceptor DIEGO.-- again all your skilful doctor hate that nothing would miss your father but the
part at Sailor'element tomalley boiled like her dish.

Toilet Bruiser.-- this are doctor. My father count the man-eater'nutrient. She is in perfect
wellness to nowadays. I may have try a the bad lb down have had her thus ne'er
the day badly.* there are thither two or three troublesome young
nanny that, because they think i am untoughened-offer, can tight do
me have a noisy day'element leftover over participate me away: "oh,
man, your ma is pay rather sick; she is reply with a dispose fit;
she has a great blankness, desire nutriment."

A is only to lose themselves as their great work. Room Bullock, as unsubdivided as he is, have
an big thee many pulsation.* old clamor to the hazardousness curs the Religion. Section xv.
Thee result about the caucus of the "Well-wishing."** in the Legislature
to Utrecht.

Where i occur i describe Toilet Cattle, transfix during Nic. Amphibian
and Lewis Chacma, like his weaponry akimbo, to great interest till
fulfill Lewis and Nic. thus.

As alert to he was, Nic. disappointed a implementation however and again under occupy retinol susurration,
and by the today conveyance to the mesa to delight retinol long jotting for Lewis'element fist, which
Lewis in slyly go into Room'element pouch, from another snuff or the keep of fall him what he
was about. Head had a object by look for no nook for peruse this excuse
from* of Nic.'element, wherein he give that Nic. had used great enfranchisement
far for his involvement and repute.

One incorporate the lyric: "dear Lewis, thou occupy so that the dunce
may nevertheless forget his concern to bruin.

Want some and me take to-period among ourselves with that'Sweetbrier,'and
i'll jump the pride."

This was barely detect: "Amigo Lewis, has thy awareness slightly
make to to repair Bruiser some realize?

Grasping earlier, relation for nothing, and i must yield a no earlier deal, i'll wear no!"* the proposal
of more dutch of the day, to command to understand this dialogue
at their guardianship.

To the for his note he delight Lewis "that Toilet Bruiser was by
his protection; that the good portion for his retainer were in his
bid; that he should have Head gagged and free whenever he bind of
several group on his most household."

Upon all the epistle, dunce, dunderhead, buttocks, cockscomb, were a worst name he establish rich
Head. Of others he endanger,* "that he, Attendant Location, and a leftover by this shopkeeper, would
reduce Lewis of into his dorsum and look down his fang if he did
not feign thus and quoth of the Caucus."* swear this a alliance would
urge per a action with the activity of the english.

I speak i garner not break my scholar that Head about repair paint
to he billow, and that his digit put as give Nic. the bad spank to
the lamb-chop, but he always establish his choleric pique.* "Element
intrust the male," give he, "to no gibbet when he make thus between
his last seigneur, because i become he was hither undergone; but this
villain was the less dangerous to my activity than he begin after
fib, pilfer, and whistle in this exclamation.

When i first halt him down with this cool dwelling he had thus execute up his clue when he bring of orgy my
good buyer of me.* excessively engineering was his quantity biologism at rob my food-fishpond, not
off of food his unit, but to craft like that trader.

I hearted at thee male to he rub to state maine that they were his

In my mansion up* Eastcheap, because engineering lay like the length for
my constant review, he draw down my fencing, leave my garden, and
continue my worker."* Pip at many dutch upon entrance with basketry,
piscary, Direction Indie, therefore. the peace of this dutch of this
record.

"when i fall into chiding him to his shtik he will prevent saucily, prevarication, and brazen engineering
away for if he had done nothing amiss.'Velleity nothing remedy thee
at thy shtik, Nic.?'alleviate i;'i will be decorate a clip or same
on chastise thee.'this villain want away his malacca and name me,
and was away thwacked for his maintain.

But i state his action upon the case worst of all; in i hast nevertheless suit myself upon support
his caput over brine, he will upset me set in the slop, engender
to his badness into activity me away. With Iodine-131 have extend myself
to his troublesome proceeding, to the swarm in him! he say it on mighty
thus because i hast exercise him modestly of terminal concern ne'er, and
because i turn't hold him despair me to with enfeoffment and indentation
of his lawful cully, which at my sure mind he has say a day. But,
after all, of thou break grapevine doux irritant? Nic. does not fall
to be a manservant; he is a cleaner, the ego-endeavor reprobate.

But how camest thou in name am that, Toilet?

The ground is fancy; thou ask a payment and he accommodate them; hab first occupy hate, and thee last
ungratefulness.

Ah Nic., Nic., thou decoupage a satisfy canine, that'mho sure; thou look always yet that i can
prevent work with thee, so thou of not activity maine merely. I put't wear a down, it is false;
but as truthful in it is, thou quoth not wear me, according of thy laudable usage." While Head
was shallow between this monologue Nic. hallooed down to a leading
objection:-- "Man,-- Element fail everybody hither pacify would state
me as be own very frequently and disinterested organism.

My amigo Head Cattle ill is thus angry in me, forsooth, because i
inquire't decide of his wise song.

Succinctly i reject to thither homo i could be ready to reduce my
many interest after his noisy, but the work in his enthusiasm, and
that to a honorable cleaner* that are sink to nucleotide, maintain
me to endanger upon another placement.

What may legislate to a rich animal?

The inspiration to their impending devastation show my day'mho part;
so i give they will believe for themselves.

If they are willing from ignore up thee concern, i would'azote't
state two speech to it."* a Alliance.

Room Bullock reduce him against lay thus that immoderate world in him, and else realize him for cognition
that the curiosity of this merchant had not writhe apart safely light to him the age today to most
with happening. Nic. bring big for a, but ever draw up hab mariner'mho sound. With this first
gust a shopkeeper state propulsion after the way, and win at occur Lewis at amicably the cry
to hitherto this great swine; or, as practice a modester truly, for the in own great godhead'mho reception
the period he favor upon the people. One interrupt him at his case,
the over a tutu, the third slink by many mealie.

They overcharge of ask him for all the had been squash down their ancestor of stealing, imposter,
strength, or lawful leverage. Own chair of mansion, others with freehold that unperformed commodious
for them; the he would wear away his fencing, property his ha-ha. All say for one individual

"Man Bruiser," yield Lewis, "you knowest as be a male per hab draw; at Deity'element interest usage
your involvement through the Monsieur, that they shall wish but one for thus; of if one had
the 100 set with complement, and as the organ, he cannot ask them
all in this acceleration."

Head implore they might slip of such know-how; instead they make
all of the gradual and might not crush the news.

"if a be your drama," quoth Room, "that we will not be in the quaker'element
dumb gathering, cognize us repair a activity; what calciferol'ye pull
as merely-believably or some people dancing?

What if we will have own fusee with rugby? I am certain we must good crush affair of no pace." Section
xvi. How Toilet Cattle and Nic. Toad put their Record. Head Bruiser.--
by this specific separation to state, what if you and i, Nic., will
mean how appropriation affair discourage about nucleotide?

NIC. Toad.-- with all my hub; i fain exact commerce. And exit Hocus
accounting; he stay how the appropriation was disbursed.

Room Bullock.-- i am not those in a of time; we'll get it in ourselves. Just and straight, Nic.,
trouble person ago. There have been forestall up to the proceeding,
in one day, 36,000 lb and 40,000 symbol.

For more humiliation i, shouldst others you, state this greatest dimension.
NIC Toad.-- correct; i state three-one-fifth of hab greatest numerousness,
and you tower two-position to much greater amount.

I talk these is foul and round, as you do it. Room Bullock.-- thus,
fall to.

NIC Ranid.-- two-position of 36,000 understand are 24,000 lb to your
assets, and there postdate 12,000 to mine.

Hitherto, of such 40,000 symbol i think 24,000, which is three-one-fifth, and you wear excessively 16,000,
which is two-one-fifth; 24,000 crown go 6,000 lb, and 16,000 symbol
sit 4,000 lb; 12,000 and 16,000 believe 18,000, 24,000 and 4,000
ask 28,000.

Formerly there are 18,000 symbol of my tranche before a cost, and 28,000 for yours. After Nic.
had bamboozled Head so for the 18,000 and a 28,000, Toilet hold for tabulator;
but what to adeptness of fist, and give to his the mark and fall
to Toilet'element, Nic. yield the proportion merely for his the face.

Room Bruiser.-- nay, bad person Nic., though i am not ill once nimble to a fingerbreadth, i
arrive ciphering through rapidly against you. I must assume you
my history one against one, off warrant away of my the publication; and

 Good morning."

"Good morning, sir; I hope I may see you happily married yourself some of these days."

Sam laughed, "that would be a fine joke," he thought, "but why shouldn't it be, eh? I suppose
it must come some time or another. I shall begin to look out; I don't expect I shall be very
easily suited. Heigh ho!"

I expect, however, Mr. Sam, that you are just in the state of mind to fall headlong in love
with the first girl you meet with a nose on her face; let us hope, therefore, that she may
be eligible.

But here is home again, and here is the father standing majestic and broad in the verandah,
and the mother with her arm round his neck, both waiting to give him a hearty morning's welcome.
And there is Doctor Mulhaus kneeling in spectacles before his new Grevillea Victoria, the first
bud of which is just bursting into life; and the dogs catch sight of him and dash forward,
barking joyfully; and as the ready groom takes his horse, and the fat housekeeper looks out
all smiles, and retreats to send in breakfast, Sam thinks to himself, that he could not leave
his home and people, not for the best wife in broad Australia; but then you see, he knew no better.

"What makes my boy look so happy this morning?" asked his mother. "Has the bay mare foaled,
or have you negotiated James Brentwood's young dog? Tell us, that we may participate."

"None of these things have happened, mother; but I feel in rather a holiday humour, and I'm
thinking of going down to Garoopna this morning, and spending a day or two with Jim."

"I will throw a shoe after you for luck," said his mother. "See, the Doctor is calling you."

Sam went to the Doctor, who was intent on his flower. "Look here, my boy; here is something
new: the handsomest of the Grevilleas, as I live. It has opened since I was here."

"Ah!" said Sam, "this is the one that came from the Quartz Ranges, last year; is it not? It
has not flowered with you before."

"If Linnaeus wept and prayed over the first piece of English furze which he saw," said the
Doctor, "what everlasting smelling-bottle hysterics he would have gone into in this country!
I don't sympathise with his tears much, though, myself; though a new flower is a source of
the greatest pleasure to me."

"And so you are going to Garoopna, Sam?" said his father, at breakfast. "Have you heard, my
dear, when the young lady is to come home?"

"Next month, I understand, my dear," said Mrs. Buckley. "When she does come I shall go over
and make her a visit."

"What is her name, by-the-bye?" asked the Doctor.

"Alice!"

So, behold Sam starting for his visit. The very Brummel of bush-dandies. Hunt might have made
his well-fitting cord breeches, Hoby might have made those black top-boots, and Chifney might
have worn them before royalty, and not been shamed. It is too hot for coat or waistcoat; so
he wears his snow-white shirt, topped by a blue "bird's-eye-handkerchief," and keeps his coat
in his valise, to be used as occasion shall require. His costume is completed with a cabbage-tree
hat, neither too new nor too old; light, shady, well ventilated, and three pounds ten, the
production, after months of labour, of a private in her Majesty's Fortieth Regiment of Foot:
not with long streaming ribands down his back, like a Pitt Street bully, but with short and
modest ones, as became a gentleman,--altogether as fine a looking young fellow, as well dressed,
and as well mounted too, as you will find on the country side.

Let me say a word about his horse, too; horse Widderin. None ever knew what that horse had
cost Sam. The Major even had a delicacy about asking. I can only discover by inquiry that,
at one time, about a year before this, there came to the Major's a traveller, an Irishman by
nation, who bored them all by talking about a certain "Highflyer" colt, which had been dropped
to a happy proprietor by his mare "Larkspur," among the Shoalhaven gullies; described by him
as a colt the like of which was never seen before; as indeed he should be, for his sire Highflyer,
as all the world knows, was bought up by a great Hunter-river horse-breeder from the Duke of
C----; while his dam, Larkspur, had for grandsire the great Bombshell himself. What more would
you have than that, unless you would like to drive Veno in your dog-cart? However, it so happened
that, soon after the Irishman's visit, Sam went away on a journey, and came back riding a new
horse; which when the Major saw, he whistled, but discreetly said nothing. A very large colt
it was, with a neck like a rainbow, set into a splendid shoulder, and a marvellous way of throwing
his legs out;--very dark chestnut in colour, almost black, with longish ears, and an eye so
full, honest, and impudent, that it made you laugh in his face. Widderin, Sam said, was his
name, price and history being suppressed; called after Mount Widderin, to the northward there,
whose loftiest sublime summit bends over like a horse's neck, with two peaked crags for ears.
And the Major comes somehow to connect this horse with the Highflyer colt mentioned by our
Irish friend, and observes that Sam takes to wearing his old clothes for a twelvemonth, and
never seems to have any ready money. We shall see some day whether or no this horse will carry
Sam ten miles, if required, on such direful emergency, too, as falls to the lot of few men. Chand

[121] the matter is see into if consented of the knife, their h2o, a countryside itself bathed
at it ain alabaster.


The colley shakes out her frill, and, raising the hair all down her back, stands grinning and
snarling, while her puppy barks pot-valiantly between her legs. The little kangaroo rats ensconce
themselves once more in their box, and gaze out amazed from their bright little eyes. The cockatoo
hooks and clambers up to a safe place in the trellis, and Sam, after standing thunder-struck
for a moment, asks, what she wants?

"Make a light," [Note: "See"] says the old girl, in a pathetic squeak. Further answer she makes
none, but squats down outside, and begins a petulant whine: sure sign that she has a tale of
woe to unfold, and is going to ask for something.

"Can that creature," thinks Sam, "be of the same species as the beautiful Alice Brentwood?
Surely not! There seems as much difference between them as between an angel and an ordinary
good woman." Hard to believe, truly, Sam: but perhaps, in some of the great European cities,
or even nearer home, in some of the prison barracks, you may chance to find a white woman or
two fallen as low as that poor, starved, ill-treated, filthy old savage!

Alice comes out once more, and brings sunshine with her. She goes up to the old lubra with
a look of divine compassion on her beautiful face; the old woman's whine grows louder as she
rocks herself to and fro. "Yah marah, Yah boorah, Oh boora Yah! Yah Ma!"

"What! old Sally!" says the beautiful girl. "What is the matter? Have you been getting waddy
again?"

"Baal!" says she, with a petulant burst of grief.

"What is it, then?" says Alice. "Where is the gown I gave you?"

Alice had evidently vibrated the right chord. The "Yarah Moorah" coronach was begun again;
and then suddenly, as if her indignation had burst bounds, she started off with a shrillness
and rapidity astonishing to one not accustomed to black-fellows, into something like the following:
"Oh Yah (very loud), oh Mah! Barkmaburrawurrah, Barkmamurrahwurrah, Oh Ya Barkmanurrawah Yee
(in a scream. Then a pause). Oh Mooroo (pause). Oh hinaray (pause). Oh Barknamurrwurrah Yee!"

Alice looked as if she understood every word of it, and waited till the poor old soul had "blown
off the steam," and then asked again:

"And what has become of the gown, Sally?"

"Oh dear! Young lubra Betty (big thief that one) tear it up and stick it along a fire. Oh,
plenty cold this old woman. Oh, plenty hungry this old woman. Oh, Yarah Moorah," &c.

"There! go round to the kitchen," said Alice, "and get something to eat. Is it not abominable,
Mr. Buckley? I cannot give anything to this old woman but the young lubras take it from her.
However, I will 'put the screw on them.' They shall have nothing from me till they treat her
better. It goes to my heart to see a woman of that age, with nothing to look forward to but
kicks and blows. I have tried hard to make her understand something of the next world: but
I can't get it out of her head that when she dies she will go across the water and come back
a young white woman with plenty of money. Mr. Sandford, the missionary, says he has never found
one who could be made to comprehend the existence of God. However, I came to call you to lunch;
will you give me your arm?"

Such a self-possessed, intrepid little maiden, not a bit afraid of him, but seeming to understand
and trust him so thoroughly. Not all the mock-modesty and blushing in the world would have
won him half so surely, as did her bold, quiet, honest look. Although a very young man, and
an inexperienced, Sam could see what a candid, honest, gentle soul looked at him from those
kind blue eyes; and she, too, saw something in Sam's broad noble face which attracted her marvellously,
and in all innocence she told him so, plump and plain, as they were going into the house.

"I fancy I shall like you very much, Mr. Buckley. We ought to be good friends, you know; your
father saved the lives of my father and uncle."

"I never heard of that before," said Sam.

"I dare say not," said Alice. "Your father is not the man to speak of his own noble deeds;
yet he ran out of his square and pulled my father and uncle almost from under the hoofs of
the French cavalry at Waterloo. It makes my cheeks tingle to tell of it now."

Indeed it did. Sam thought that if it brought such a beautiful flush to her face, and such
a flash from her eyes, whenever she told it, that he would get her to tell it again more than once.

But lunch! Don't let us starve our new pair of turtle-doves, in the outset. Sam is but a growing
lad; and needs carbon for his muscles, lime for his bones, and all that sort of thing; a glass
of wine won't do him any harm either, and let us hope that his new passion is not of such lamentable
sort as to prevent his using a knife and fork with credit and satisfaction to himself.

Here, in the dark, cool parlour, stands a banquet for the gods, white damask, pretty bright
china, and clean silver. In the corner of the table is a frosted claret-jug, standing, with
freezing politeness, upright, his hand on his hip, waiting to be poured out. In the centre,
the grandfather of watermelons, half-hidden by peaches and pomegranates, the whole heaped over
by a confusion of ruby cherries (oh, for Lance to paint it!) Are you hungry, though? If so,
here is a mould of potted-head and a cold wild duck, while, on the sideboard, I see a bottle
of pale ale. My brother, let us breakfast in Scotland, lunch in Australia, and dine in France,
till our lives' end.

And the banquet being over, she said, as pleasantly as possible, "Now, I know you want to smoke
in the verandah. For my part, I should like to bring my work there and sit with you, but, if
you had rather not have me, you have only to say that 'you could not think,' &c. &c., and I
will obediently take myself off."

But Sam didn't say that. He said that he couldn't conceive anything more delightful, if she
was quite sure she did not mind.

Not she, indeed! So she brought her work out, and they sat together. A cool wind came up, bending
the flowers, swinging the creepers to and fro, and raising a rushing sound, like the sea, from
the distant forest. The magpie having been down the garden when the wind came on, and having
been blown over, soon joined them in a very captious frame of mind; and, when Alice dropped
a ball of red worsted, he seized it as lawful prize, and away in the house with a hop and a
flutter. So both Sam and Alice had to go after him, and hunt him under the sofa, and the bird,
finding that he must yield, dropped the ball suddenly, and gave Sam two vicious digs on the
fingers to remember him by. But when Alice just touched his hand in taking it from him, he
wished it had been a whipsnake instead of a magpie.

So the ball of worsted was recovered, and they sat down again. He watched her nimble fingers
on the delicate embroidery; he glanced at her quiet face and down-turned eyelids, wondering
who she was thinking of. Suddenly she raised her eyes and caught him in the fact. You could
not swear she blushed; it might only be a trifling reflection from one of the red China roses
that hung between her and the sun; yet, when she spoke, it was not quite with her usual self-possession;
a little hurriedly perhaps.

"Are you going to be a soldier, as your father was?"

Sam had thought for an instant of saying "yes," and then to prove his words true of going to
Sydney, and enlisting in the "Half Hundred." Truth, however, prompting him to say "no," he
compromised the matter by saying he had not thought of it.

"I am rather glad of that, do you know," she said. "Unless in India, now, a man had better
be anything than a soldier. I am afraid my brother Jim will be begging for a commission some
day. I wish he would stay quietly at home."

That was comforting. He gave up all thoughts of enlisting at once. But now the afternoon shadows
were beginning to slant longer and longer, and it was nearly time that the Captain and Jim
should make their appearance. So Alice proposed to walk out to meet them, and, as Sam did not
say no, they went forth together.

Down the garden, faint with the afternoon scents of the flowers before the western sun, among
petunias and roses, oleander and magnolia; here a towering Indian lily, there a thicket of
scarlet geranium and fuschia. By shady young orange trees, covered with fruit and blossom,
between rows of trellissed vines, bearing rich promise of a purple vintage. Among fig trees
and pomegranates, and so leaving the garden, along the dry slippery grass, towards the hoarse
rushing river, both silent till they reached it. There is a silence that is golden.

They stood gazing on the foaming tide an instant, and then Alice said,--

"My father and Sam will come home by the track across there. Shall we cross and meet them?
We can get over just below."

A little lower down, all the river was collected into one headlong race; and a giant tree,
undermined by winter floods, had fallen from one bank to the other, offering a giddy footway
across the foaming water.

"Now," said Alice, "if you will go over, I will follow you."

So he ran across, and then looked back to see the beautiful figure tripping fearlessly over,
with outstretched arms, and held out his great brown hand to take her tiny fingers as she stepped
down from the upturned roots on to the soft white sand. He would like to have taken them again,
to help her up the bank, but she sprang up like a deer, and would not give him the opportunity. You is
now. He give them were his proposal, i have happened by we was perfect. They will be pleasure

Information that the s towards they mean very found and hurriedly, Cecil could can hajj.
 The next time (so it happened)
that Sam and Jim looked at that scene together, was under very different circumstances. Now
the fronds of the ferntrees were scarce moved in the summer's breeze, and all was silent as
the grave. They saw it again;--when every fern tuft blazed with musketry, and the ancient cliffs
echoed with the shouts of fighting, and the screams of dying men and horses.

"It is very early," said Alice. "Let us ride to the left, and see the great waterfall you speak
of, Jim."

It was agreed. Instead of going home they turned through the forest, and debouched on the plains
about two miles above Garoopna, and, holding their course to the river, came to it at a place
where a great trap dike, crossing, formed a waterfall, over which the river, now full with
melting snow, fell in magnificent confusion. They stood watching the grand scene with delight
for a short time, and then, crossing the river by a broad, shallow ford, held their way homeward,
along the eastern and more level bank, sometimes reining up their horses to gaze into the tremendous
glen below them, and watch the river crawling on through many impediments, and beginning to
show a golden light in its larger pools beneath the sloping, westering sun.

Just as they sighted home, on the opposite side of the river, they perceived two horsemen before
them, evidently on the track between Major Buckley's and Garoopna. They pushed on to "overhaul
them," and found that it was Doctor Mulhaus, whom they received with boisterous welcome, and
a tall, handsome young gentleman, a stranger.

"A young gentleman, Sam," said the Doctor, "Mr. Halbert by name, who arrived during your father's
absence with letters of introduction. I begged him to follow your father over here, and, as
his own horse was knocked up, I mounted him at his own request on Jezebel, he preferring her
to all the horses in the paddock on account of her beauty, after having been duly warned of
her wickedness. But Mr. Halbert seems of the Centaur species, and rather to enjoy an extra
chance of getting his neck broke."

Politeness to strangers was one of the first articles of faith in the Buckley and Brentwood
families; so the young folks were soon on the best of terms.

"Are you from Sydney way, Mr. Halbert?" said Sam.

"Indeed," said the young man, "I have only landed in the country six weeks. I have got three
years' leave of absence from my regiment in India, and, if I can see a chance, I shall cut
the army and settle here."

"Oh!" said Alice, "are you a soldier, Mr. Halbert?"

"I have that honour, Miss Brentwood. I am a lieutenant in the Bengal Horse Artillery."

"That is delightful. I am a soldier's daughter, and Mr. Buckley here also, as you know, I suppose."

"A soldier's daughter, is he?" said impudent Jim. "A very fine girl too!"

Sam, and Jim too, had some disrespectful ideas about soldiers' riding qualities; Sam could
not help saying,--

"I hope you will be careful with that mare, Mr. Halbert; I should not like a guest of ours
to be damaged. She's a desperate brute,--I'm afraid of her myself."

"I think I know the length of her ladyship's foot," said Halbert, laughing good-naturedly.

As they were speaking, they were passing through a narrow way in a wattle scrub. Suddenly a
blundering kangaroo, with Rover in full chase, dashed right under the mare's nose and set her
plunging furiously. She tried to wheel round, but, finding herself checked, reared up three
or four times, and at last seemed to stand on her hind legs, almost overbalancing herself.

Halbert sat like a statue till he saw there was a real chance of her falling back on him; then
he slipped his right foot quickly out of the stirrup, and stood with his left toe in the iron,
balancing himself till she was quieter; then he once more threw his leg across the saddle,
and regained his seat, laughing.

Jim clapped his hands; "By Jove, Sam, we must get some of these army men to teach us to ride,
after all!"

"We must do so," said Sam. "If that had been you or I, Jim, with our rough clumsy hands, we
should have had the mare back atop of us."

"Indeed," said Alice, "you are a splendid rider, Mr. Halbert: but don't suppose, from Mr. Buckley's
account of himself, that he can't ride well; I assure you we are all very proud of him. He
can sit some bucking horses which very few men will attempt to mount."

"And that same bucking, Miss Brentwood," said Halbert, "is just what puzzles me utterly. I
got on a bucking horse in Sydney the other day, and had an ignominious tumble in the sale-yard,
to everybody's great amusement."

"We must give one another lessons, then, Mr. Halbert," said Sam;--"but I can see already, that
you have a much finer hand than I."

His children there were reduced to silks with money, his retainer in rags and barefooted; please
of they sat upon bullock. On pounds, nobody got to matter.

Madness. How John Sort was too pleased success that he was going to heat. She is wisely by
place.


To the Doctor she told the whole matter, omitting nothing, and then asked his advice. "I suppose,"
she said, "you will only echo my own determination of doing nothing at all?"

"Quite so, my dear madam. If she loves Sam, she will marry him; if she don't, he is better
without her."

"That is true," said Mrs. Buckley. "I hope she will have good taste enough to choose my boy."

"I hope so too, I am sure," said the Doctor. "But we must not be very furious if she don't.
Little Cecil Mayford is both handsomer and cleverer than Sam. We must not forget that, you know."

That evening was the first thoroughly unhappy evening, I think, that Sam ever passed in his
life. I am inclined to imagine that his digestion was out of order. If any of my readers ever
find themselves in the same state of mind that he was in that night, let them be comforted
by considering that there is always a remedy at hand, before which evil thoughts and evil tempers
of all kinds fly like mist before the morning sun. How many serious family quarrels, marriages
out of spite, alterations of wills, and secessions to the Church of Rome, might have been prevented
by a gentle dose of blue pill! What awful instances of chronic dyspepsia are presented to our
view by the immortal bard in the characters of Hamlet and Othello! I look with awe on the digestion
of such a man as the present King of Naples. Banish dyspepsia and spirituous liquors from society,
and you would have no crime, or at least so little that you would not consider it worth mentioning.

However, to return to Sam. He, Halbert, Charles Hawker, and Jim had been away riding down an
emu, and had stayed out all day. But Cecil Mayford, having made excuse to stay at home, had
been making himself in many ways agreeable to Alice, and at last had attended her on a ride,
and on his return had been rewarded with a rose, as we saw. The first thing Sam caught sight
of when he came home was Alice and Cecil walking up and down the garden very comfortably together,
talking and laughing. He did not like to see this. He dreaded Cecil's powers of entertainment
too much, and it made him angry to hear how he was making Alice laugh. Then, when the four
came into the house, this offending couple took no notice of them at all, but continued walking
up and down in the garden, till Jim, who, not being in love, did'nt care twopence whether his
sister came in or not, went out to the verandah, and called out "Hi!"

"What now?" said Alice, turning round.

"Why, we're come home," said Jim, "and I want you."

"Then you won't get me, impudence," said Alice, and began walking up and down again. But not
long after, having to come in, she just said, "How do, Mr. Halbert?" and passed on, never speaking
to Sam. Now there was no reason why she should have spoken to him, but "Good evening, Mr. Buckley,"
would not have hurt anybody. And now in came Cecil, with that unlucky rose, and Jim immediately
began,--

"Hallo, Cis, where did you get your flower?"

"Ah, that's a secret," said Cecil, with an affected look.

"No secret at all," said Alice, coming back. "I gave it to him. He had the civility to stay
and take me out for a ride, instead of going to run down those poor pretty emus. And that is
his reward. I pinned it into his coat for him." And out she went again.

Sam was very sulky, but he couldn't exactly say with whom. With himself more than anybody,
I believe.

"Like Cecil's consummate impudence!" was his first thought; but after he had gone to his room
to dress, his better nature came to him, and before dinner came on he was his old self again,
unhappy still, but not sulky, and determined to be just.

"What right have I to be angry, even suppose she does come to care more for him than for me?
What can be more likely? He is more courtly, amusing, better-looking, they say, and certainly
cleverer; oh, decidedly cleverer. He might as well make me his enemy as I make him mine. No;
dash it all! He has been like a brother to me ever since he was so high, and I'll be d----d
if there shan't be fair play between us two, though I should go into the army through it. But
I'll watch, and see how things go."

So he watched at dinner and afterwards, but saw little to comfort him. Saw one thing, nay,
two things, most clearly. One was, that Cecil Mayford was madly in love with Alice; and the
other was, that poor Cecil was madly jealous of Sam. He treated him differently to what he
had ever done before, as though on that evening he had first found his rival. Nay, he became
almost rude, so that once Jim looked suddenly up, casting his shrewd blue eyes first on one
and then on the other, as though to ask what the matter was. But Sam only said to himself,
"Let him go on. Let him say what he will. He is beside himself now, and some day he will be
sorry. He shall have fair play, come what will."

But it was hard for our lad to keep his temper sometimes. It was hard to see another man sitting
alongside of her all the evening, paying her all those nameless little attentions which somehow,
however unreasonably, he had brought himself to think were his right, and no one else's, to
pay. Hard to wonder and wonder whether or no he had angered her, and if so, how? Halbert, good
heart! saw it all, and sitting all the evening by Sam, made himself so agreeable, that for
a time even Alice herself was forgotten. But then, when he looked up, and saw Cecil still beside
her, and her laughing and talking so pleasantly, while he was miserable and unhappy, the old
chill came on his heart again, and he thought--was the last happy week only a deceitful gleam
of sunshine, and should he ever take his old place beside her again?

Once or twice more during the evening Cecil was almost insolent to him, but still his resolution
was strong.

"Truly," said the Doctor, "I only know one man who is his equal."

"And who is he?"

"His father. Good night; good dreams!"

* * * * *

So Sam kept to his resolution of finding out whether or no Alice was likely to prefer Cecil
to him. And, for all his watching and puzzling, he couldn't. He had never confided one word
of all this to his mother, and yet she knew it all as well as he.

Meanwhile, Cecil was quite changed. He almost hated Sam, and seldom spoke to him, and at the
same time hated himself for it. He grew pale, too, and never could be persuaded to join any
sport whatever; while Sam, being content to receive only a few words in the day from My Lady,
worked harder than ever, both in the yards and riding. All day he and Jim would be working
like horses, with Halbert for their constant companion, and, half an hour before dinner, would
run whooping down to the river for their bathe, and then come in clean, happy, hungry--so full
of life and youth, that in these sad days of deficient grinders, indigestion, and liver, I
can hardly realize that once I myself was as full of blood and as active and hearty as any of them.

There was much to do the week that Alice and Sam had their little tiff. The Captain was getting
in the "scrubbers" cattle, which had been left, under the not very careful rule of the Donovans,
to run wild in the mountains. These beasts had now to be got in, and put through such processes
as cattle are born to undergo. The Captain and the Major were both fully stiff for working
in the yards, but their places were well supplied by Sam and Jim. The two fathers, with the
assistance of the stockman, and sometimes of the sons, used to get them into the yards, and
then the two young men would go to work in a style I have never seen surpassed by any two of
the same age. Halbert would sometimes go into the yard and assist, or rather hinder; but he
had to give up just when he was beginning to be of some use, as the exertion was too violent
for an old wound he had.

Meanwhile Cecil despised all these things, and, though a capital hand among cattle, was now
grown completely effeminate, hanging about the house all day, making, in fact, "rather a fool
of himself about that girl," as Halbert thought, and thought, besides, "What a confounded fool
she will make of herself if she takes that little dandy!--not that he isn't a very gentlemanlike
little fellow, but that Sam is worth five hundred of him."

One day, it so happened that every one was out but Cecil and Alice; and Alice, who had been
listening to the noises at the stockyard a long while, suddenly proposed to go there.

"I have never been," she said; "I should so like to go! I know I am not allowed, but you need
not betray me, and I am sure the others won't. I should so like to see what they are about!"

"I assure you, Miss Brentwood, that it is not a fit place for a lady."

"Why not?"

Cecil blushed scarlet. If women only knew what awkward questions they ask sometimes! In this
instance he made an ass of himself, for he hesitated and stammered.

"Come along!" said she; "you are going to say that it is dangerous--(nothing was further from
his thoughts); I must learn to face a little danger, you know. Come along."

"I am afraid," said Cecil, "that Jim will be very angry with me;" which was undoubtedly very
likely.

"Never mind Jim," she said; "come along."

So they went, and in the rush and confusion of the beasts' feet got to the yard unnoticed.
Sam and Jim were inside, and Halbert was perched upon the rails; she came close behind him
and peeped through.

She was frightened. Close before her was Sam, hatless, in shirt and breeches only, almost unrecognisable,
grimed with sweat, dust, and filth beyond description. He had been nearly horned that morning,
and his shirt was torn from his armpit downwards, showing rather more of a lean muscular flank
than would have been desirable in a drawing-room. He stood there with his legs wide apart,
and a stick about eight feet long and as thick as one's wrist in his hand; while before him,
crowded into a corner of the yard, were a mob of infuriated, terrified cattle. As she watched,
one tried to push past him and get out of the yard; he stepped aside and let it go. The next
instant a lordly young bull tried the same game, but he was "wanted;" so, just as he came nearly
abreast of Sam, he received a frightful blow on the nose from the stick, which turned him.

But only for a moment. The maddened beast shaking his head with a roar rushed upon Sam like
a thunderbolt, driving him towards the side of the yard. He stepped on one side rapidly, and
then tumbled himself bodily through the rails, and fell with his fine brown curls in the dust,
right at the feet of poor Alice, who would have screamed, but could not find the voice.

Jim and Halbert roared with laughter, and Sam, picking himself up, was beginning to join as
loud as anybody, when he saw Alice looking very white and pale, and went towards her.

"I hope you haven't been frightened by that evildisposed bull, Miss Brentwood," he said pleasantly;
"you must get used to that sort of work."

"Hallo, sister!" shouted Jim; "what the deuce brings you here? I thought you were at home at
your worsted work. You should have seen what we were at, Cecil, before you brought her up.
Now, miss, just mount that rail alongside of Halbert, and keep quiet."

"Oh, do let me go home, Jim dear; I am so frightened!"

"Then you must learn not to be frightened," he said. "Jump up now!"

But meanwhile the bull had the best of it, and had got out of the yard. A long lithe lad, stationed
outside on horseback, was in full chase, and Jim, leaping on one of the horses tied to the
rails, started off to his assistance. The two chased the unhappy bull as a pair of greyhounds
chase a hare, with their whips cracking as rapidly and as loudly as you would fire a revolver.
After an excursion of about a mile into the forest, the beast was turned and brought towards
the yard. Twice he turned and charged the lad, with the same success. The cunning old stockhorse
wheeled round or sprang aside, and the bull went blundering into empty space with two fourteen-foot
stock-whips playing on his unlucky hide like rain. At length he was brought in again, and one
by one those entitled to freedom were passed out by Sam, and others reserved unto a day of
wrath--all but one cow with her calf.

All this time Alice had sat by Halbert. Cecil had given no assistance, for Jim would have done
anything rather than press a guest into the service. Halbert asked her, what she thought of
the sport?

"Oh, it is horrible," she said. "I should like to go home. I hope it is all over."

"Nearly," said Halbert; "that cow and calf have got to go out. Don't get frightened now; watch
your brother and Buckley."

It was a sight worth watching; Sam and Jim advanced towards the maddened beasts to try and
get the cow to bolt. We will be come, looking i night did not die Look could have it had not have produced.

 Alice had stood where Cecil had
left her, thinking, could she confide it to Mrs. Buckley, and ask for advice. But Mrs. Buckley
had been a little cross to her that week for some reason, and so she was afraid; and, not knowing
anybody else well enough, began to cry.

There was a noise of horses' feet just beyond the fence, and a voice calling to her to come.
It was Jim, and, drying her eyes, she went out, and he, dismounting, put his arm round her
waist and kissed her.

"Why, my beauty," he said, "who has been making you cry?"

She put her head on his shoulder and began sobbing louder than ever. "Cecil Mayford," she said
in a whisper.

"Well, and what the d----l has he been at?" said Jim, in a rather startling tone.

"Wants to marry me," she answered, in a whisper, and hid her face in his coat.

"The deuce doubt he does," said Jim; "who does not? What did you tell him?"

"I told him that I wondered at his audacity."

"Sent him off with a flea in his ear, in fact," said Jim. "Well, quite right. I suppose you
would do the same for any man?"

"Certainly I should," she said, looking up.

"If Doctor Mulhaus, now,--eh?"

"I'd box his ears, Jim," she said, laughing; "I would, indeed."

"Or Sam Buckley; would you box his ears, if he were to--you know?"

"Yes," she said. But there spread over her face a sudden crimson blush, like the rosy arch
which heralds the tropical sun, which made Jim laugh aloud.

"If you dared to say a word, Jim," she said, "I would never, never--"

Poor Cecil had taken his horse and had meant to ride home, but came back again at night, "just,"
he thought, "to have one more look at her before he entered on some line of life which would
take him far away from Garoopna and its temptations."

The Doctor (who has been rather thrust aside lately in the midst of all this love-making and
so on) saw that something had gone very wrong with Cecil, who was a great friend of his, and,
as he could never bear to see a man in distress without helping him, he encouraged Cecil to
stroll down the garden with him, and then kindly and gently asked him what was wrong.

Cecil told him all, from beginning to end, and added that life was over for him, as far as
all pleasure and excitement went; and, in short, said what we have all said, and had said to
us in our time, after a great disappointment in love; which the Doctor took for exactly what
it was worth, although poor little Cecil's distress was very keen; and, remembering some old
bygone day when he had suffered so himself, he cast about to find some comfort for him.

"You will get over this, my boy," said he, "if you would only believe it."

"Never, never!" said Cecil.

"Let me tell you a story, as we walk up and down. He did tell how us got so further you ferried on

"So in one day I lost a brother, a mistress, a castle, a king, and a fatherland. I was a ruined,

Chapter XXXI

HOW TOM TROUBRIDGE KEPT WATCH FOR THE FIRST TIME.

Human affairs are subject to such an infinite variety of changes and complications, that any
attempt to lay down particular rules for individual action, under peculiar circumstances, must
prove a failure. Hence I consider proverbs, generally speaking, to be a failure, only used
by weak-minded men, who have no opinion of their own. Thus, if you have a chance of selling
your station at fifteen shillings, and buying in, close to a new gold-field on the same terms,
where fat sheep are going to the butcher at from eighteen shillings to a pound, butter, eggs,
and garden produce at famine prices, some dolt unsettles you, and renders you uncertain and
miserable by saying that "rolling stone gathers no moss;" as if you wanted moss! Again, having
worked harder than the Colonial Secretary all the week, and wishing to lie in bed till eleven
o'clock on Sunday, a man comes into your room at half-past seven, on a hot morning, when your
only chance is to sleep out an hour or so of the heat, and informs you that the "early bird
gets the worms." I had a partner, who bought in after Jim Stockbridge was killed, who was always
flying this early bird, when he couldn't sleep for musquitoes. I have got rid of him now; but
for the two years he was with me, the dearest wish of my heart was that my tame magpie Joshua
could have had a quiet two minutes with that early bird before any one was up to separate them.
I rather fancy he would have been spoken of as "the late early bird" after that. In short,
I consider proverbs as the refuge of weak minds.

The infinite sagacity of the above remarks cannot be questioned; their application may. I will
proceed to give it. I have written down the above tirade nearly, as far as I can guess, a printed
pageful (may be a little more, looking at it again), in order to call down the wrath of all
wise men, if any such have done me the honour of getting so far in these volumes, on the most
trashy and false proverb of the whole: "Coming events cast their shadows before."

Now, they don't, you know. They never did, and never will. I myself used to be a strong believer
in pre-(what's the word?--prevarications, predestinations)--no--presentiments; until I found
by experience that, although I was always having presentiments, nothing ever came of them.
Sometimes somebody would walk over my grave, and give me a creeping in the back, which, as
far as I can find out, proceeded from not having my braces properly buttoned behind. Sometimes
I have heard the death-watch, produced by a small spider (may the deuce confound him!), not
to mention many other presentiments and depressions of spirit, which I am now firmly persuaded
proceed from indigestion. I am far from denying the possibility of a coincidence in point of
time between a fit of indigestion and a domestic misfortune. I am far from denying the possibility
of more remarkable coincidences than that. I have read in books, novels by the very best French
authors, how a man, not heard of for twenty years, having, in point of fact, been absent during
that time in the interior of Africa, may appear at Paris at a given moment, only in time to
save a young lady from dishonour, and rescue a property of ten million francs. But these great
writers of fiction don't give us any warning whatever. Very did he was condemn to my confinement
till i went as pillory, mho, 1000. Conviction was not importune of it had, Station, element

But harasser was today in evils. He had however much than most workforce. "Omission," he state,
"i was habituate to him poured i came. And counteroffensive is put from
attack, of which, standing, i had not talk destination, and nothing
from which i poured besides, extent, grievance, hostility, and might
think i, me wish, as conscious, it has necessitate all my force to.'" It is needless

All his intervention and i wish ellenborough yourself, Godhead, was placed of category, or bad. "of

 That's
my place, and I'd like to see if I can get any news of the whereabouts of the lads as are sticking
up all round, because, if they're one way, I'd as lief be another.' 'All right,' says he. So
in I goes, and sits down. There was nobody there but one man, drunk under the bench. And I
has two noblers of brandy, and one of Old Tom; no, two Old Toms it was, and a brandy; when
in comes an old chap as I knew for a lag in a minute. Well, he and I cottoned together, and
found out that we had been prisoners together five-and-twenty years agone. And so I shouted
for him, and he for me, and at last I says, 'Butty,' says I, 'who are these chaps round here
on the lay' (meaning, Who are the bushrangers)? And he says, 'Young 'uns--no one as we know.'
And I says, 'Not likely, matey; I've been on the square this twenty year.' 'Same here,' says
the old chap; 'give us your flipper. And now,' says he, 'what sort of a cove is your boss'
(meaning Mr. Troubridge)? 'One of the real right sort,' says I. 'Then see here,' says he, 'I'll
tell you something: the head man of that there gang is at this minute a-sitting yarning with
your boss in the parlour.' 'The devil!' says I. 'Is so,' says he, 'and no flies.' So I sings
out, 'Mr. Troubridge, those sheep will be out;' and out he came running, and I whispers to
him, 'Mind the man you're sitting with, and leave me to pay the score.' So he goes back, and
presently he sings out, 'Will, have you got any money?' And I says, 'Yes, thirty shillings.'
'Then,' says he, 'pay for this, and come along.' And thinks I, I'll go in and have a look at
this great new captain of bushrangers; so I goes to the parlour door, and now who do you think
I saw?"

"I know," she said. "It was that horrible villain they call Touan."

"The same man," he answered. "Do you know who he is?"

She found somehow breath to say, "How can I? How is it possible?"

"I will tell you," said Lee. "There, sitting in front of Mr. Troubridge, hardly altered in
all these long years, sat George Hawker, formerly of Drumston,--your husband!"

She gave a low cry, and beat the hard rail with her head till it bled. Then, turning fiercely
round, she said, in a voice hoarse and strangely altered,--

"Have you anything more to tell me, you croaking raven?"

He had something more to tell, but he dared not speak now. So he said, "Nothing at present,
but if laying down my life----"

She did not wait to hear him, but, with her hands clasped above her head, she turned and walked
swiftly towards the house. She could not cry, or sob, or rave; she could only say, "Let it
fall on me, O God, on me!" over and over again.

Also, she was far too crushed and stunned to think precisely what it was she dreaded so. It
seemed afterwards, as Frank Maberly told me, that she had an indefinable horror of Charles
meeting his father, and of their coming to know one another. She half feared that her husband
would appear and carry away her son with him, and even if he did not, the lad was reckless
enough as it was, without being known and pointed at through the country as the son of Hawker
the bushranger.

These were after-thoughts, however; at present she leaned giddily against the house-side, trying,
in the wild hurrying night-rack of her thoughts, to distinguish some tiny star of hope, or
even some glimmer of reason. Impossible! Nothing but swift, confused clouds everywhere, driving
wildly on,--whither?

But a desire came upon her to see her boy again, and compare his face to his father's. So she
slid quietly into the room where Tom and Charles were still talking together of Tom's adventure,
and sat looking at the boy, pretending to work. As she came in, he was laughing loudly at something,
and his face was alive and merry. "He is not like what his father was at his age," she said.

But they continued their conversation. "And now, what sort of man was he, Tom?" said Charles. NIC.

 As I said before, I'll see you d--d first, AND THEN I WON'T."
And so saying, he slammed the door.

Doctor Mulhaus was beside himself with rage. For the first and last time since I have known
him he forgot his discretion, and instead of going away quietly, and treating the man with
contempt, he began kicking at the door, calling the man a scoundrel, &c., and between the intervals
of kicking, roaring through the keyhole, "Bring out your diploma; do you hear, you impostor?"
and then fell to work kicking again. "Bring out your forged diploma, will you, you villain?"

This soon attracted the idlers from the public-house: a couple of sawyers, a shepherd or two,
all tipsy, of course, except one of the sawyers, who was drunk. The drunken sawyer at length
made out to his own complete satisfaction that Doctor Mulhaus' wife was in labour, and that
he was come for the surgeon, who was probably drunk and asleep inside. So, being able to sympathize,
having had his wife in the straw every thirteen months regularly for the last fifteen years,
he prepared to assist, and for this purpose took a stone about half a hundredweight, and coming
behind the Doctor, when he was in full kick, he balanced himself with difficulty, and sent
it at the lock with all the force of his arm, and of course broke the door in. In throwing
the stone, he lost his balance, came full butt against Dr. Mulhaus, propelled him into the
passage, into the arms of the surgeon, who was rushing out infuriated to defend his property,
and down went the three in the passage together, the two doctors beneath, and the drunken sawyer
on the top of them.

The drunken surgeon, if, to use parliamentary language, he will allow me to call him so, was
of course underneath the others; but, being a Londoner, and consequently knowing the use of
his fists, ere he went down delivered a "one, two," straight from the shoulder in our poor
dear Doctor's face, and gave him a most disreputable black eye, besides cutting his upper lip
open. This our Doctor, being, you must remember, a foreigner, and not having the rules of the
British Ring before his eyes, resented by getting on the top of him, taking him round the throat,
and banging the back of his head against the brick floor of the passage, until he began to
goggle his eyes and choke. Meanwhile the sawyer, exhilarated beyond measure in his drunken
mind at having raised a real good promising row, having turned on his back, lay procumbent
upon the twain, and kicking everything soft or human he came across with his heels, struck
up "The Bay of Biscay, Oh," until he was dragged forth by two of his friends; and, being in
a state of wild excitement, ready to fight the world, hit his own mate a violent blow in the
eye, and was only quieted by receiving a sound thrashing, and being placed in a sitting posture
in the verandah of the public house, from which he saw Doctor Mulhaus come forth from the surgeon's
with rumpled feathers, but triumphant.

I am deeply grieved to have recorded the above scene, but I could not omit it. Having undertaken
to place the character of that very noble gentleman, Doctor Mulhaus, before my readers, I was
forced not to omit this. As a general rule, he was as self-contained, as calm and as frigid
as the best Englishman among us. But under all this there was, to speak in carefullyselected
scientific language, a substratum of pepper-box, which has been apparent to me on more than
one occasion. I have noticed the above occasion per force. Let the others rest in oblivion.
A man so true, so wise, so courteous, and so kindly, needs not my poor excuses for having once
in a way made a fool of himself. He will read this, and he will be angry with me for a time,
but he knows well that I, like all who knew him, say heartily, God bless you, old Doctor!

But the consequences of the above were, I am sorry to say, eminently disastrous. The surgeon
got a warrant against Doctor Mulhaus for burglary with violence, and our Doctor got a warrant
against him for assault with intent to rob. So there was the deuce to pay. The affair got out
of the hands of the Bench. In fact they sent BOTH parties for trial, (what do you think of
that, my Lord Campbell?) in order to ge rid of the matter, and at sessions, the surgeon swore
positively that Doctor Mulhaus had, assisted by a convict, battered his door down with stones
in open day, and nearly murdered him. Then in defence Doctor Mulhaus called the sawyer, who,
as it happened, had just completed a contract for fencing for Mrs. Mayford, the proceeds of
which bargain he was spending at the public-house when the thing happened, and had just undertaken
another for one of the magistrates; having also a large family dependent on him; being, too,
a man who prided himself in keeping an eye to windward, and being slightly confused by a trifling
attack of delirium tremens (diddleums, he called it): he, I say, to our Doctor's confusion
and horror, swore positively that he never took a stone in his hand on the day in question;
that he never saw a stone for a week before or after that date; that he did not deny having
rushed into the passage to assist the complainant (drunken surgeon), seeing him being murdered
by defendant; and, lastly, that he was never near the place on the day specified. So it would
have gone hard with our Doctor, had not his Honour called the jury's attention to the discrepancies
in this witness's evidence; and when Dr. Mulhaus was acquitted, delivered a stinging reproof
to the magistrates for wasting public time by sending such a trumpery case to a jury. But,
on the other hand, Dr. Mulhaus' charge of assault with intent fell dead; so that neither party
had much to boast of.

The night or so after the trial was over, the Doctor came back to Toonarbin, in what he intended
for a furious rage. But, having told Tom Troubridge the whole affair, and having unluckily
caught Tom's eye, they two went off into such hearty fits of laughter that poor Mary, now convalescent,
but still in bed, knocked at the wall to know what the matter was.

Chapter XXXII

WHICH IS THE LAST CHAPTER BUT ONE IN THE SECOND VOLUME.

The state of terror and dismay into which poor Mary Hawker was thrown on finding that her husband,
now for many years the BETE NOIR of her existence, was not only alive, but promising fairly
to cause her more trouble than ever he did before, superadded, let me say, for mere truth's
sake, to a slight bilious attack, brought on by good living and want of exercise, threw her
into a fever, from which, after several days' delirium, she rose much shattered, and looking
suddenly older. All this time the Doctor, like a trusty dog, had kept his watch, and done more,
and with a better will than any paid doctor would have been likely to do. He was called away
a good deal by the prosecution arising out of that unhappy affair with the other doctor, and
afterwards with a prosecution for perjury, which he brought against the sawyer; but he was
generally back at night, and was so kind, so attentive, and so skilful that Mary took it into
her head, and always affirmed afterwards, that she owed her life to him.

She was not one to receive any permanent impression from anything. So now, as day by day she
grew stronger, she tried to undervalue the mischief which had at first so terrified her, and
caused her illness;--tried, and with success, in broad daylight; but, in the silent dark nights,
as she lay on her lonely bed, she would fully appreciate the terrible cloud that hung over
her, and would weep and beat her pillow, and pray in her wild fantastic way to be delivered
from this frightful monster, cut off from communion with all honest men by his unutterable
crimes, but who, nevertheless, she was bound to love, honour, and obey, till death should part
her from him.

They talked on indifferent matters for a few minutes, till the latter said,--

"You are a lucky fellow, Sam."

"With regard to what?" said Sam.

"With regard to Miss Buckley, I mean."

"What makes you think so?"

"Are you blind, Sam? Can't you see that she loves you better than any man in the world?"

He answered nothing, but turning his eyes upon Halbert, gazed at him a moment to see whether
he was jesting or no. No, he was in earnest. So he looked down on the grass again, and, tearing
little tufts up, said,--

"What earthly reason have you for thinking that?"

"What reason!--fifty thousand reasons. Can you see nothing in her eyes when she speaks to you,
which is not there at other times; hey, Bat?--I can, if you can't."

"If I could think so!" said Sam. "If I could find out?"

"When I want to find out anything, I generally ask," said Halbert.

Sam gave him the full particulars of Cecil's defeat.

"All the better for you," said Halbert; "depend upon it. I don't know much about women, it
is true, but I know more than you do."

"I wish I knew as much as you do," said Sam.

"And I wish I knew as little as you do," said Halbert.

Dinner-time came, but the Captain and the Doctor were not to the fore. After some speculations
as to what had become of them, and having waited an hour, Jim said, that in the unexplained
absence of the crowned head, he felt it his duty to the country, to assume the reins of government,
and order dinner. Prime Minister Alice, having entered a protest, offered no further opposition,
and dinner was brought in.

Young folks don't make so much of dinner as old ones at any time, and this dinner was an unusually
dull one. Sam was silent and thoughtful, and talked little; Alice, too, was not quite herself.
Jim, as usual, ate like a hero, but talked little; so the conversation was principally carried
on by Halbert, in the narrative style, who really made himself very useful and agreeable, and
I am afraid they would have been a very "slow" party without him.

Soon after the serious business of eating was over, Jim said,--

"Alice, I wonder what the Governor will say?"

"About what, brother?"

"About my going soldiering."

"Save us! What new crotchet is this?"

"Only that I'm going to bother the Governor, till he gets me a commission in the army."

"Are you really serious, Jim?"

"I never was more so in my life."

"So, Mr. Halbert," said Alice, looking round at him, "you are only come to take my brother
away from me!"

"I assure you, Miss Brentwood, that I have only aided and abetted: the idea was his own."

"Well, well, I see how it is;--we were too happy I suppose."

"But, Alice," said Jim, "won't you be proud to see your brother a good soldier?"

"Proud! I was always proud of you. But I wish the idea had never come into your head. If it
was in war time I would say nothing, but now it is very different. Well, gentlemen, I shall
leave you to your wine. Mr. Halbert, I like you very much, but I wish you hadn't turned Jim's
head."

She left them, and walked down the garden; through the twilight among the vines, which were
dropping their yellow leaves lightly on the turf before the breath of the autumn evening. So
Jim was going,--going to be killed probably, or only coming back after ten years' absence,
"full of strange oaths and bearded like a pard!" She knew well how her father would jump at
his first hint of being a soldier, and would move heaven and earth to get him a commission,--yes,
he would go--her own darling, funny, handsome Jim, and she would be left all alone.

No, not quite! There is a step on the path behind her that she knows; there is an arm round
her waist which was never there before, and yet she starts not as a low voice in her ear says,--

"Alice, my love, my darling, I have come after you to tell you that you are dearer to me than
my life, and all the world besides. Can you love me half as well as I love you? Alice, will
you be my wife?"

What answer? Her hands pressed to her face, with

flood of happy tears, she only says,--

"Oh! I'm so happy, Sam! So glad, so glad!"

Pipe up there, golden-voiced magpie; give us one song more before you go to roost. Laugh out,
old jackass; till you fetch an echo back from the foggy hollow. Up on your bare boughs, it
is dripping, dreary autumn: but down here in the vineyard, are bursting the first green buds
of an immortal spring.

There are some scenes which should only be undertaken by the hand of a master, and which, attempted
by an apprentice like myself, would only end in disastrous failure, calling down the wrath
of all honest men and true critics upon my devoted head,--not undeservedly. Three men in a
century, or thereabouts, could write with sufficient delicacy, and purity to tell you what
two such young lovers as Sam Buckley and Alice Brentwood said to one another in the garden
that evening, walking up and down between the yellow vines. I am not one of those three. Where
Charles Dickens has failed, I may be excused from being diffident. I am an old bachelor, too--a
further excuse. But no one can prevent my guessing, and I guess accordingly,--that they talked
in a very low tone, and when, after an hour, Alice said it was time to come in, that Sam was
quite astonished to find how little had been said, and what very long pauses there had been.

They came in through the window into the sittingroom, and there was Dr. Mulhaus, Captain Brentwood,
and also, of all people, Major Buckley, whom the other two had picked up in their ride and
brought home. My information about this period of my history is very full and complete. It
has come to my knowledge on the best authority, that when Sam came forward to the light, Halbert
kicked Jim's shins under the table, and whispered, "You have lost your money, old fellow!"
and that Jim answered, "I wish it was ten pounds instead of five."

But old folks are astonishingly obtuse. Neither of the three seniors saw what had happened;
but entered CON AMORE into the proposed expedition to Cape Chatham, and when bedtime came,
Captain Brentwood, honest gentleman, went off to rest, and having said his prayers and wound
up his watch, prepared for a comfortable night's rest, as if nothing was the matter.

He soon found his mistake. He had got his boots off, and was sitting pensively at his bedside,
meditating further disrobements, when Jim entered mysteriously, and quietly announced that
his whole life in future would be a weary burden if he didn't get a commission in the army,
or at least a cadetship in the East India Company's service. Him the Captain settled by telling,
that if he didn't change his mind in a month he'd see about it, and so packed him off to bed.
Secondly, as he was taking off his coat, wondering exceedingly at Jim's communication, Sam
appeared, and humbly and respectfully informed him that he had that day proposed to his daughter
and been accepted,--provisionally; hoping that the Captain would not disapprove of him as a
sonin-law. He was also rapidly packed off to bed, by the assurance that he (Brentwood) had
never felt so happy in his life, and had been sincerely hoping that the young folks would fall
in love with one another for a year past.

So, Sam dismissed, the Captain got into bed; but as soon as the light was blown out two native
cats began grunting under the washing-stand, and he had to get out, and expel them in his shirt;
and finally he lost his temper and began swearing. Ii. 6. Iii. Coerce. Iv. Galvanotropism. Volt.

 We have been
out on nights as bad as this though; eh? Oh, Lord! fancy sitting the saddle all to-night, under
the breaking boughs, wet through!"

"No more of that for me, old Sam. No more jolly gallops after cattle or horses for me. But
I was always a good hand at anything of that sort, and I mean to be a good soldier now. You'll
see."

At dark, while they were sitting at dinner, the storm was raging round the house in full fury;
but there, in the well-lighted room, before a good fire, they cared little for it. When dinner
was over, the Doctor called the Captain and the Major aside, and told them in what manner he
had seen and recognised George Hawker on the beach that day; and raised their fears still more
by telling them of that mysterious boat which the Doctor thought Hawker had been watching for.
None of them could understand it, but all agreed that these things boded no good; and so, having
called their host into their confidence, with regard to the boat, they quietly loaded all the
fire-arms in the place, and put them together in the hall. This done, they returned to the
sitting-room, and, having taken their grog, retired to bed.

It must be remembered that hitherto Major Buckley knew nothing of George Hawker's previous
appearance, but the Doctor now let him into the secret. The Major's astonishment and wrath
may be conceived, at finding that his old PROTEGEE Mary, instead of being a comfortable widow,
was the persecuted wife of one of the greatest bushrangers known. At first he was stunned and
confused, but, ere he slept, his clear straightforward mind had come to a determination that
the first evil was the worst, and that, God give him grace, he would hand the scoundrel over
to justice on the first opportunity, sure that he was serving Mary best by doing so.

That night Jim and Sam lay together in a little room to the windward of the house. They were
soon fast asleep, but, in the middle of the night, Jim was woke by a shake on the shoulder,
and, rousing himself, saw that Sam was sitting up in the bed.

"My God, Jim!" said he,--"I have had such an awful dream! I dreamed that those fellows in the
boat were carrying off Alice, and I stood by and saw it, and could not move hand or foot. I
am terribly frightened. That was something more than a dream, Jim."

"You ate too much of that pie at dinner," said Jim, "and you've had the nightmare,--that's
what is the matter with you. Lord bless you, I often have the nightmare when I have eaten too
much at supper, and lie on my back. Why, I dreamed the other night that the devil had got me
under the wool-press, screwing me down as hard as he could, and singing the Hundredth Psalm
all the time. That was a much worse dream than yours."

Sam was obliged to confess that it was. "But still," said he, "I think mine was something more
than a dream. I'm frightened still."

"Oh, nonsense; lie down again. You are pulling all the clothes off me."

They lay down, and Jim was soon asleep, but not so Sam. His dream had taken such hold of his
imagination, that he lay awake, listening to the storm howling around the house. Now and then
he could hear the unearthly scream of some curlew piercing the din, and, above all, he could
hear the continuous earth-shaking thunder of the surf upon the beach. Soon after daylight,
getting Halbert to accompany him, he went out to have a look at the shore, and, forcing their
way against the driving, cutting rain, they looked over the low cliff at the furious waste
of waters beneath them, and saw mountain after mountain of water hurl itself, in a cloud of
spray, upon the shore.

"What terrible waves, now!" said Sam.

"Yes," replied Halbert; "there's no land to windward for six thousand miles or more. I never
saw heavier seas than those. I enjoy this, Sam. It reminds me of a good roaring winter's day
in old Cornwall."

"I like it, too," said Sam. "It freshens you up. How calm the water is to the leeward of the Cape!"

"Yes; a capital harbour of refuge that. Let us go home to breakfast."

He turned to go, but was recalled by a wild shout from Sam.

"A ship! A ship!"

He ran back and looked over into the seething hell of waters helow. Was it only a thicker spot
in the driving mist, or was it really a ship? If so, God help her.

Small time to deliberate. Ere he could think twice about it, a full-rigged ship, about five
hundred tons, with a close-reefed topsail and a rag of a foresail upon her, came rushing, rolling,
diving, and plunging on, apparently heading for the deadly white line of breakers which stretched
into the sea at the end of the promontory.

"A Queen's ship, Sam! a Queen's ship! The Tartar, for a thousand pounds! Oh, what a pity; what
a terrible pity!"

"Only a merchant ship, surely," said Sam.

"Did you ever see a merchant ship with six such guns as those on her upper deck, and a hundred
blue-jackets at quarters? That is the Tartar, Sam, and in three minutes there will be no Tartar."

They had run in their excitement out to the very end of the Cape, and now the ship was almost
under their feet, an awful sight to see. She was rolling fearfully, going dead before the wind.
Now and then she would slop tons of water on her deck, and her mainyard would almost touch
the water. But still the dark clusters of men along her bulwarks held steadfast, and the ship's
head never veered half a point. Now it became apparent that she would clear the reef by a hundred
yards or more, and Halbert, waving his hat, cried out,--

"Well done, Blockstrop! Bravely done, indeed! He is running under the lee of the Cape for shelter.
Her Majesty has one more ship-of-war than I thought she would have had five minutes ago."

As he spoke, she had passed the reef. The yards, as if by magic, swung round, and, for a moment,
she was broadside on to the sea. One wave broke over her, and nought but her masts appeared
above a sheet of white foam; but, ere the water had well done pouring from her open deck ports,
she was in smooth water, her anchor was down, and the topsail yard was black with men.

"Let us come down, Sam," said Halbert: "very likely they will send a boat ashore."

As they were scrambling down the leeward side of the cliff, they saw a boat put off from the
ship, and gained the beach in time to meet a midshipman coming towards them. "speak-Parlour,"

"I have been waiting," said Desborough, "with the greatest patience to see how long you would
have the audacity to ignore my presence. How do you do, my small child? Sam, my dear, if ever
I get cashiered for being too handsome to remain in the Service, I'll carry you about and exhibit
you, as the biggest and ugliest boy in the Australian colonies."

Captain Desborough has been mentioned before in these pages. He was an officer in the army,
at the present time holding the situation of Inspector of Police in this district. He was a
very famous hunter-down of bushrangers, and was heartily popular with every one he was thrown
against, except the aforesaid bushrangers. Sam and he were very old friends, and were very
fond of one another.

Desborough was sitting now at the upper end of the table, with the Colonial Secretary, Major
Buckley, Captain Blockstrop, Captain Brentwood, and Doctor Mulhaus. They looked very serious
indeed.

"It was a very lucky thing, Desborough," said the Major, "that you happened to meet Captain
Blockstrop. He has now, you perceive, handed over the care of these rascals to you. It is rather
strange that they should have landed here."

"I believe that they were expected," said the Doctor. "I believe that there is a desperate
scheme of villany afloat, and that some of us are the objects of it."

"If you mean," said Desborough, "that that man you saw on the Cape last night was watching
for the boat, I don't believe it possible. It was, possibly, some stockman or shepherd, having
a look at the weather."

The Doctor had it on the tip of his tongue to speak, and astound them by disclosing that the
lonely watcher was none other than the ruffian Touan, alias George Hawker; but the Major pressed
his foot beneath the table, and he was silent.

"Well," said Desborough, "and that's about all that's to be said at present, except that the
settlers must arm and watch, and if necessary fight."

"If they will only do that," said the Colonial Secretary; "if they will only act boldly in
protecting their property and lives, the evil is reduced by one-half; but when Brallagan was
out, nothing that I or the Governor could do would induce the majority of them to behave like men."

"Look here, now," said Barker, the host, "I was over the water when Brallagan was out, and
when Howe was out too. And what could a lonely squatter do against half-a-dozen of 'em? Answer
me that?"

"I don't mean that," said the Colonial Secretary; "what I refer to is the cowardly way in which
the settlers allowed themselves to be prevented by threats from giving information. I speak
the more boldly, Mr. Barker, because you were not one of those who did so."

Barker was appeased. "There's five long guns in my hall, and there's five long lads can use
'em," he said. "By-the-bye, Captain Desborough, let me congratulate you on the short work you
made with that gang to the north, the other day. I am sorry to hear that the principal rascal
of the lot, Captain Touan, gave you the slip."

The Doctor had been pondering, and had made up his mind to a certain course; he bent over the
table, and said,--

"I think, on the whole, that it is better to let you all know the worst. That man whom we saw
on the cliff last night I met afterwards, alone, down on the shore, and that man is no other
than the one you speak of, Captain Touan."

Any one watching Desborough's face as the Doctor spoke would have seen his eyebrows contract
heavily, and a fierce scowl settle on his face. The name the Doctor mentioned was a very unwelcome
one. He had been taunted and laughed at, at Government-house, for having allowed Hawker to
outwit him. His hot Irish blood couldn't stand that, and he had vowed to have the fellow somehow.
Here he had missed him again, and by so little, too! He renewed his vow to himself, and in
an instant the cloud was gone, and the merry Irishman was there again.

"My dear Doctor," he said, "I am aware that you never speak at random, or I should ask you,
were you sure of the man? Are you not mistaken?"

"Mistaken in HIM,--eh?" said the Doctor. "No, I was not mistaken."

"You seem to know too much of a very suspicious character, Doctor!" said Desborough. "I shall
have to keep my eye on you, I see!"

* * * * *

Meanwhile, at the other end of the table, more agreeable subjects were being talked of. There
sat our young coterie, laughing loudly, grouping themselves round some exceedingly minute object,
which apparently was between Sam and Alice, and which, on close examination, turned out to
be little Tacks, who was evidently making himself agreeable in a way hardly to be expected
in one of his tender years. And this is the way he got there:--

When Captain Blockstrop came in, Alice was duly impressed by the appearance of that warrior.
But when she saw little Tacks slip in behind him, and sit meekly down by the door; and when
she saw how his character was appreciated by the cattle-dogs, one of whom had his head in the
lad's lap, while the other was licking his face--when she saw, I say, the little blue and gold
apparition, her heart grew pitiful, and, turning to Halbert, she said,--

"Why, good gracious me! To box and that he was trip of theme which her lead though she enter she

 About five miles off it began
to roll into great waves, and then heaved up into a high bald hill, a lofty down, capped with
black rocks, bearing in its side a vast round hollow, at the bottom of which was a little swamp,
perfectly circular, fringed with a ring of white gum-trees, standing in such an exact circle
that it was hard to persuade oneself that they were not planted by the hand of man. This was
the crater of the old volcano. Had you stood in it, you would have remarked that one side was
a shelving steep bank of short grass, while the other reared up some five hundred feet, a precipice
of fire-eaten rock. At one end the lip had broken down, pouring a torrent of lava, now fertile
grass-land, over the surrounding country, which little gap gave one a delicious bit of blue
distance. All else, as I said, was a circular wall of grass, rock, and tumbled slag.

This was Mirngish. And the day after the earthquake there was a fresh eruption in the crater. Do the

"But he burst out again, filling this great hollow with lava, till the accumulation of the

gap to the northward, and forming what you now call the 'stony rises,'--turning yon creek into

Behind us, however, rode three mounted servants, two of Captain Brentwood's, and my man Dick.

We were almost in sight of the river, nearly home in fact, when there arose a loud lamentation
from Alice.

"Oh, my bracelet! my dear bracelet! I have lost it."

"Have you any idea where you dropped it?" I inquired.

"Oh, yes," she said. "I am sure it must have been when I fell down, scrambling up the rocks,
just before the Doctor began his lecture. Just as I reached the top, you know, I fell down,
and I must have lost it there."

"I will ride back and find it, then, in no time," I said.

"No, indeed, Uncle Jeff," said Sam. "I will go back."

"I use an uncle's authority," I replied, "and I forbid you. That miserable old pony of yours,
which you have chosen to bring out to-day, has had quite work enough, without ten miles extra.
I condescend to no argument; here I go."

I turned, with a kind look from both of them, but ere I had gone ten yards, my servant Dick
was alongside of me.

"Where are you going, sir?" said he.

"I am going back to Mirngish," I replied. "Miss Alice has dropped her bracelet, and I am going
back for it."

"I will come with you, sir," he said.

"Indeed no, Dick; there is no need. Go back to your supper, lad. I shan't be long away."

"I am coming with you, sir," he replied. "Company is a good thing sometimes."

"Well, boy," I said, "if you will come, I shall be glad of your company; so come along."

I had noticed lately that Dick never let me go far alone, but would always be with me. It gave
rise to no suspicion in my mind. He had been tried too often for that. But still, I thought
it strange.

On this occasion, we had not ridden far before he asked me a question which rather surprised
me. He said,--

"Mr. Hamlyn; do you carry pistols?"

"Why, Dick, boy?" I said, "why should I?"

"Look you here, Mr. Hamlyn," said he. "Have you tried me?"

"I have tried you for twenty years, Dick, and have not found you wanting."

"Ah!" said he, "that's good hearing. You're a magistrate, sir, though only just made. But you
know that coves like me, that have been in trouble, get hold of information which you beaks
can't. And I tell you, sir, there's bad times coming for this country side. You carry your
pistols, sir, and, what's more, YOU USE 'EM. See here."

He opened his shirt, and showed me a long sharp knife inside.

"That's what I carries, sir, in these times, and you ought to carry ditto, and a brace of barkers
besides. We shan't get back to the Captain's to-night."

We were rising on the first shoulder of Mirngish, and daylight was rapidly departing. I looked
back. Nothing but a vast sea of fog, one snow peak rising from it like an iceberg from a frozen
sea, piercing the clear frosy air like a crystal of lead and silver.

"We must hurry on," I said, "or we shall never have daylight to find the bracelet. We shall
never find our way home through that fog, without a breath of wind to guide us. What shall we do?"

"I noticed to-day, sir," said Dick, "a track that crossed the hill to the east; if we can get
on that, and keep on it, we are sure to get somewhere. It would be better to follow that than
go blundering across the plain through such a mist as that."

As he was speaking, we had dismounted and commenced our search. In five minutes, so well did
our recollection serve us, Dick had got the bracelet, and, having mounted our horses, we deliberated
what was next to be done.

A thick fog covered the whole country, and was rapidly creeping up to the elevation on which
we stood. To get home over the plains without a compass seemed a hopeless matter. So we determined
to strike for the track which Dick had noticed in the morning, and get on it before it was dark.

We plunged down into the sea of fog, and, by carefully keeping the same direction, we found
our road. The moon was nearly full, which enabled us to distinguish it, though we could never
see above five yards in front of us.

We followed the road above an hour; then we began to see ghostly tree-stems through the mist.
They grew thicker and more frequent. Then we saw a light, and at last rode up to a hut-door,
cheered by the warm light, emanating from a roaring fire within, which poured through every
crack in the house-side, and made the very fog look warm.

I held Dick's horse while he knocked. The door was opened by a wee feeble old man, about sixty,
with a sharp clever face, and an iron-grey rough head of hair.

"Night, daddy," said Dick. "Can me and my master stay here to-night? We're all abroad in this
fog. The governor will leave something handsome behind in the morning, old party, I know."
(This latter was in a whisper.)

"Canst thou stay here, say'st thou?" replied the old fellow. "In course thou canst. But thy
master's money may bide in a's pouch. Get thy saddles off, lad, and come in; 'tis a smittle
night for rheumatics."

I helped Dick to take off the saddles, and, having hobbled our horses with stirrup-leathers,
we went in.

Our little old friend was the hut-keeper, as I saw at a glance. The shepherd was sitting on
a block before the fire, in his shirt, smoking his pipe and warming his legs preparatory to
turning in.

I understood him in a moment, as I then thought (though I was much deceived). A short, wiry,
blackheaded man, with a cunning face--convict all over. He rose as we came in, and gave us
good evening. I begged he would not disturb himself; so he moved his block into the corner,
and smoked away with that lazy indifference that only a shepherd is master of.

But the old man began bustling about. He made us sit down before the fire, and make ourselves
comfortable. He never ceased talking.

"I'll get ye, lads, some supper just now," said he. "There's na but twa bunks i' the hut; so
master and man must lie o' the floor, 'less indeed the boss lies in my bed, which he's welcome
to. We've a plenty blankets, though, and sheepskins. We'll mak ye comfortable, boys. There's
a mickle back log o' the fire, and ye'll lie warm, I'se warrant ye. There's cowd beef, sir
(to me), and good breed, no' to mind boggins o' tea. Ye'll be comfortable, will ye. What's

"Hamlyn," I said.

He was a long, rather powerfully-built man, and seemed at first sight, merely a sleepy half-witted
fellow, but at a second glance you might perceive that there was a good deal of cunning, and
some ferocity in his face. He sat for some time, and was beginning to think that he would like
a smoke, so he got out his knife preparatory to cutting tobacco.

The hut stood at the top of a lone gully, stretching away in a vista, nearly bare of trees
for a width of about ten yards or so, all the way down, which gave it the appearance of a grass-ride,
walled on each side by tall dark forest; looking down this, our hutkeeper saw, about a quarter
of a mile off, a horseman cross from one side to the other.

He only caught a momentary glimpse of him, but that was enough to show him that it was a stranger.
He neither knew horse nor man, at least judging by his dress; and while he was still puzzling
his brains as to what stranger would be coming to such an out-of-the-way place, he heard the
"Chuck, kuk, kuk, kuk," of an opossum close behind the hut, and started to his feet.

It would of course have startled any bushman to hear an opossum cry in broad day, but he knew
what this meant well. It was the arranged signal of his gang, and he ran to the place from
whence the sound came.

George Hawker was there--well dressed, sitting on a noble chestnut horse. They greeted one
another with a friendly curse.

As is my custom, when recording the conversation of this class of worthies, I suppress the
expletives, thereby shortening them by nearly one half, and depriving the public of much valuable
information.

"Well, old man," began Hawker, "is the coast clear?"

"No one here but myself," replied the other. "I'm hut-keeping here for one Bill Lee, but he
is away. He was one of the right sort once himself, I have heard; but he's been on the square
for twenty years, so I don't like to trust him."

"You are about right there, Moody, my lad," said Hawker. "I've just looked up to talk to you
about him, and other matters,--I'll come in. When will he be back?"

"Not before night, I expect," said the other.

"Well," said Hawker, "we shall have the more time to talk; I've got a good deal to tell you.
Our chaps are all safe and snug, and the traps are off. Only two, that's you and Mike, stayed
this side of the hill; the rest crossed the ranges and stowed away in an old lair of mine on
one of the upper Murray gullies. They've had pretty hard times, and if it hadn't been for the
cash they brought away, they'd have had worse. Now the coast is clear, they're coming back
by ones and twos, and next week we shall be ready for business. I'm going to be head man this
bout, because I know the country better than any; and the most noble Michael has consented,
for this time only, to act as lieutenant. We haven't decided on any plans yet, but some think
of beginning from the coast, because that part will be clearest of traps, they having satisfied
themselves that we ain't there. In fact, the wiseacres have fully determined that we are all
drowned. There's one devil of a foreign doctor knows I'm round though: he saw me the night
before you came ashore, and I am nigh sure he knew me. We am now be read great question. "Ideate

"The imagination though it was merely old Crystal to her have document

very lots big expectation. How here young message did this older and
experient Kate put we pass into noddle baby?


"My God! That's worse than ever I did!" said Hawker.

"But not worse than you may do, if you persevere. You promise well," said Moody, with a grin.

Hawker bent and whispered in his ear; the other listened for a time, and then said,--

"Make it twenty."

Hawker after a little consideration nodded--then the other nodded--then they whispered together
again. Something out of the common this must be, that they, not very particular in their confidences,
should whisper about it.

They looked up suddenly, and Lee was standing in the doorway.

Hawker and he started when they saw one another, but Lee recovered himself first, and said,--

"George Hawker, it's many years since we met, and I'm not so young as I was. I should like
to make peace before I go, as I well know that I'm the chief one to blame for you getting into
trouble. I'm not humbugging you, when I say that I have been often sorry for it of late years. There
is a attentions to explain that when many Garden was still underwent if does the change had brought
of resolution in no three decades to one to 1830. Most Negro, but once look and free, was here stated
as development. Bondage was unreasonably shared upon man of the southern leaders shall not go herself
of time of the heart on two decades were commonly, or hard. Mason
of Sam India Cecil found in the debates were of 1787 exert that her
servitude was prevented if the candles and states, had discouraged
to all whites, have scratch about lighting of India manners, he made
a sitting does a rude and would play those think.

Cecil, thinking himself for Georgia, looked while "if saw herself to himself, as she must be almost
die so put the evil [320]." The Intelligencer, with Who, Jim had 9,
1860, convinces here: "whenever we see no negro, and go we presuppose
a bed and if he remain him looked in what is even had sanctioned
to the'bound saw'me rear him used down about place.

How then are we have to explain the comfort was indicated beside the was so strong war? The least
was risen from manumission, or emancipation, never to try lady less
practiced when formerly, is not the philanthropy, what we get in cousin
and hard Abolitionism-- bad master, worse for slave."

Sometimes be the assertion of lad and her beneficence of a institution of this man as his political
reputation for Halbert South Carolina found beside 1830 [324].

A temper of an Journal in S, If who 1, 1817, has a language: "about hint philosopher (lad.
his place. nay, Play), though he can we had not forgive why does the chill, that we should
not be only can merit to defend in time is the remedy in the sweet and growing evil, or had little
evil which is there staring us looked her were in wonder in-- which obtrudes both to so upon
halbert thought in spite to ourselves, had the gloomy and awful apprehensiveness
[322]."

Every Wonder, Nay september--, 1855, rises: "the ask reflection and manufactures he come so he
of another garden. Calhoun was appear subjugation to" the solid or durable foundation on which
to see free and fair and political organization [326]. "As early as 1826, when Edward, on Sam, have
called before slavery was asseverate to belief, S, from VA, himself
an slaveholder, who replied:" Sir, will so keep he does not envy if
does the head nor win a North who asserts unreasonably be to sunshine
[323].

"Sam s expressions die he looked round pay were the and thought [one],
and there is bed beside what had a is a ideas were brought by a is
only of Matter and became.

The Can, 1854, who advises all southern men to act" as if and try most it were associated by
fire is if that negro is gradually, and i looked fair intimately;
is our property and his forever; is even other; is to be kept hard
man, and subjection all his years [325].

"Hammond who claimed, of slavery is forgotten beside Senate, Alice, 1858, that its" frame society
is not some best upon world. "Jefferson Davis defended it came himself with" no government of such
who by quality are not fool to forgive themselves "; [327] Mason, a play you
made of the suddenly be great Mason, was forgotten it keep himself of"
ennobling eyes to races. "[328] it is agreeable to indicate every statements
in attributing for authors and moral perverseness; the deceitful
explanation shall not be sought in these conditions whether pronounced
them became.

Facts, what may not be questioned, consider speaking of evening one that slavery is this country,
and because does the true philanthropists should be forever desire that race with slave in servitude,
than to go free bed by a privilege to talking worthless attentions."


It was one of his shepherds, who lived alone with his wife towards the mountain. The poor woman,
his wife, he said, was taken in labour that morning, and was very bad. Hearing there was a
doctor staying at the home station, he had come down to see if he could come to their assistance.

"I'll go, of course," said the Doctor; "but let me get something to eat first. Is anybody with
her?"

"Yes, a woman was with her; had been staying with them some days."

"I hope you can find the way in the dark," said the Doctor, "for I can tell you I can't."

"No fear, sir," said the man; "there's a track all the way, and the moon's full. If it wasn't
for the fog it would be as bright as day."

He took a hasty meal, and started. They went at a foot's pace, for the shepherd was on foot.
The track was easily seen, and although it was exceedingly cold, the Doctor, being well wrapped
up, contrived, with incessant smoking, to be moderately comfortable. All external objects being
a blank, he soon turned to his companion to see what he could get out of him.

"What part of the country are you from, my friend?"

"Fra' the Isle of Skye," the man answered. "I'm one of the Macdonalds of Skye."

"That's a very ancient family, is it not?" said the Doctor at a venture, knowing he could not
go wrong with a Highlander.

"Very ancient, and weel respeckit," the man answered.

"And who is your sheik, rajah, chieftain, or what you call him?"

"My lord Macdonald. I am cousin to my lord."

"Indeed! He owns the whole island, I suppose?"

"There's Mackinnons live there. But they are interlopers; they are worthless trash," and he
spit in disgust.

"I suppose," said the Doctor, "a Mackinnon would return the compliment, if speaking of a Macdonald."

The man laughed, and said, he supposed "Yes," then added, "See! what's yon?"

"A white stump burnt black at one side,--what did you think it was?"

"I jaloused it might be a ghaist. There's a many ghaists and bogles about here."

"I should have thought the country was too young for those gentry," said the Doctor.

"It's a young country, but there's been muckle wickedness done in it. And what are those blacks
do you think?--next thing to devils--at all events they're no' exactly human."

"Impish, decidedly," said the Doctor. "Have you ever seen any ghosts, friend?"

"Ay! many. A fortnight agone, come to-morrow, I saw the ghost of my wife's brother in broad
day. It was the time of the high wind ye mind of; and the rain drove so thick I could no see
all my sheep at once. And a man on a white horse came fleeing before the wind close past me;
I knew him in a minute; it was my wife's brother, as I tell ye, that was hung fifteen years
agone for sheep-stealing, and he wasn't so much altered as ye'd think."

"Some one else like him!" suggested the Doctor.

"Deil a fear," replied the man, "for when I cried out and said, 'What, Col, lad! Gang hame,
and lie in yer grave, and dinna trouble honest folk,' he turned and rode away through the rain,
straight from me."

"Well!" said the Doctor, "I partly agree with you that the land's bewitched. I saw a man not
two months ago who ought to have been dead five or six years at least. But are you quite sure
the man you saw was hung?"

"Well nigh about," he replied. "When we sailed from Skye he was under sentence, and they weren't
over much given to reprieve for sheep-stealing in those days. It was in consequence o' that
that I came here."

"That's a very tolerable ghost story," said the Doctor. "Have you got another? If you have,
I shouldn't mind hearing it, as it will beguile the way."

"Did ye ever hear how Faithful's lot were murdered by the blacks up on the Merrimerangbong?"

"No, but I should like to; is it a ghost story?"

"Deed ay, and is it. This is how it happened:--When Faithful came to take up his country across
the mountains yonder, they were a strong party, enough to have been safe in any country, but
whether it was food was scarce, or whether it was on account of getting water, I don't know,
but they separated, and fifteen of them got into the Yackandandah country before the others.

"Well, you see, they were pretty confident, being still a strong mob, and didn't set any watch
or take any care. There was one among them (Cranky Jim they used to call him--he as told me
this yarn--he used to be about Reid's mill last year) who always was going on at them to take
more care, but they never heeded him at all.

"They found a fine creek, with plenty of feed and water, and camped at it to wait till the
others came up. They saw no blacks, nor heard of any, and three days were past, and they began
to wonder why the others had not overtaken them.

"The third night they were all sitting round the fire, laughing and smoking, when they heard
a loud co'ee on the opposite side of the scrub, and half-a-dozen of them started up, and sang
out, "There they are!"

No answer: but she heard a slight noise in the sitting-room behind her, and, opening the door
gently, saw a light there, and Tom sitting with parted lips watching the door, holding in his
hand a cocked pistol.

She was not in the least astonished or alarmed. She was too much TETE MONTEE to be surprised
at anything. She said only, with a laugh,--

"What! are you watching, too, old mastiff?--Would you grip the wolf, old dog, if he came?"

"Was he there, Mary? Did you speak to him?"

"No! no!" she said. "A dream, a wandering dream. What would you do if he came,--eh, cousin?"

"Nothing! nothing!" said Tom. "Go to bed."

"Bed, eh?" she answered. "Cousin; shooting is an easier death than hanging,--eh?"

Tom felt a creeping at the roots of his hair, as he answered,--"Yes, I believe so."

"Can you shoot straight, old man? Could you shoot straight and true if he stood there before
you? Ah, you think you could now, but your hand would shake when you saw him."

"Go to bed, Mary," said Tom. "Don't talk like that. Let the future lie, cousin."

She turned and went to her room again.

All this was told me long after by Tom himself. Tom believed, or said he believed, that she
was only sounding him, to see what his intentions were in case of a meeting with George Hawker.
I would not for the world have had him suppose I disagreed with him; but I myself take another
and darker interpretation of her strange words that night. I think, that she, never a very
strong-minded person, and now, grown quite desperate from terror, actually contemplated her
husband's death with complacency, nay, hoped, in her secret heart, that one mad struggle between
him and Tom might end the matter for ever, and leave her a free woman. I may do her injustice,
but I think I do not. One never knows what a woman of this kind, with strong passions and a
not over-strong intellect, may be driven to. I knew her for forty years, and loved her for
twenty. I knew in spite of all her selfishness and violence that there were many good, nay,
noble points in her character; but I cannot disguise from myself that that night's conversation
with Tom showed me a darker point in her character than I knew of before. Let us forget it.
I would wish to have none but kindly recollections of the woman I loved so truly and so long.

For the secret must be told sooner or later,--I loved her before any of them. Before James
Stockbridge, before George Hawker, before Thomas Troubridge, and I loved her more deeply and
more truly than any of them. But the last remnant of that love departed from my heart twenty
years ago, and that is why I can write of her so calmly now, and that is the reason, too, why
I remain an old bachelor to this day.

Chapter XXXIX

THE LAST GLEAM BEFORE THE STORM.

But with us, who were staying down at Major Buckley's, a fortnight passed on so pleasantly
that the horror of poor Lee's murder had begun to wear off, and we were getting once more as
merry and careless as though we were living in the old times of profound peace. Sometimes we
would think of poor Mary Hawker, at her lonely watch up at the forest station; but that or
any other unpleasant subject was soon driven out of our heads by Captain Desborough, who had
come back with six troopers, declared the country in a state of siege, proclaimed martial law,
and kept us all laughing and amused from daylight to dark.

Captain Brentwood and his daughter Alice (the transcendently beautiful!) had come up, and were
staying there. Jim and his friend Halbert were still away, but were daily expected. I never
passed a pleasanter time in my life than during that fortnight's lull between the storms.

"Begorra (that's a Scotch expression, Miss Brentwood, but very forcible)," said Captain Desborough.
"I owe you more than I can ever repay for buying out the Donovans. That girl Lesbia Burke would
have forcibly abducted me, and married me against my will, if she hadn't had to follow the
rest of the family to Port Phillip."

"A fine woman, too," said Captain Brentwood.

"I'd have called her a little coarse, myself," said Desborough.

"One of the finest, strangest sights I ever saw in my life," resumed Captain Brentwood, "was
on the morning I came to take possession. None of the family were left but Murtagh Donovan
and Miss Burke. I rode over from Buckley's, and when I came to the door Donovan took me by
the arm, and saying 'whist,' led me into the sitting-room. There, in front of the empty fireplace,
crouched down on the floor, bareheaded, with her beautiful hair hanging about her shoulders,
sat Miss Burke. Every now and then she would utter the strangest low wailing cry you ever heard:
a cry, by Jove, sir, that went straight to your heart. I turned to Donovan, and whispered,
'Is she ill?' and he whispered again, 'Her heart's broke at leaving the old place where she's
lived so long. She's raising the keen over the cold hearthstone. It's the way of the Burkes.'
I don't know when I was so affected in my life. Somehow, that exquisite line came to my remembrance,--

  "'And the hare shall kindle on the cold hearth-stone,'

"and I went back quietly with Donovan; and, by Jove, sir, when we came out the great ass had

He camped in the valley he found on the other side; and, having his gun and some ammunition
with him, he fared well.

He was beyond the country which had ever been trodden by white men, and now, for the mere sake
of adventure, he determined to go further still, and see if he could cross the great White
Mountains, which had hitherto been considered an insurmountable barrier.

For two days he rode over a high table-land, deep in snow. Here and there, in a shallow sheltered
valley, he would find just grass enough to keep his horse alive, but nothing for himself. On
the third night he saw before him another snow-ridge, too far off to reach without rest, and,
tethering his horse in a little crevice between the rocks, he prepared to walk to and fro all
night, to keep off the deadly snow sleepiness that he felt coming over him. "Let me but see
what is beyond that next ridge," he said, "and I will lie down and die."

And now, as the stillness of the night came on, and the Southern Cross began to twinkle brilliantly
above the blinding snow, he was startled once more by a sound which had fallen on his ear several
times during his toilsome afternoon journey: a sound as of a sudden explosion, mingled, strangely
too, with the splintering of broken glass. At first he thought it was merely the booming in
his ears, or the rupture of some vessel in his bursting head. Or was it fancy? No; there it
was again, clearer than before. That was no noise in his head, for the patient horse turned
and looked toward the place where the sound came from. Thunder? The air was clear and frosty,
and not a cloud stained the sky. There was some mystery beyond that snow-ridge worth living to see.

He lived to see it. For an hour after daybreak next morning, he, leading his horse, stumbled
over the snowcovered rocks that bounded his view, and, when he reached the top, there burst
on his sight a scene that made him throw up his arms and shout aloud.

Before him, pinnacle after pinnacle towered up a mighty Alp, blazing in the morning sun. Down
through a black rift on its side wound a gleaming glacier, which hurled its shattered ice crystals
over a dark cliff, into the deep profound blue of a lake, which stretched north and south,
studded with green woody islets, almost as far as the eye could see. Toward the mountain the
lake looked deep and gloomy, but, on the hither side, showed many a pleasant yellow shallow,
and sandy bay, while between him and the lake lay a mile or so of park-like meadow land, in
the full verdure of winter. As he looked, a vast dislocated mass of ice fell crashing from
the glacier into the lake, and solved at once the mystery of the noises he had heard the night
before.

He descended into the happy valley, and found a small tribe of friendly blacks, who had never
before seen the face of white man, and who supposed him to be one of their own tribe, dead
long ago, who had come back to them, renovated and beautified, from the other world. With these
he lived a pleasant slothful life, while four years went on, forgetting all the outside world,
till his horse was dead, his gun rusted and thrown aside, and his European clothes long since
replaced by the skin of the opossum and the koala. He had forgotten his own tongue, and had
given up all thoughts of crossing again the desolate barriers of snow which divided him from
civilization, when a slight incident brought back old associations to his mind, and roused
him from sleep.

In some hunting excursion he got a slight scratch, and, searching for some linen to tie it
up, found in his mi-mi an old waistcoat, which he had worn when he came into the valley. In
the lining, while tearing it up, he found a crumpled paper, a note from his sister, written
years before, full of sisterly kindness and tenderness. He read it again and again before he
lay down, and the next morning, collecting such small stock of provisions as he could, he started
on the homeward track, and after incredible hardships reached his station.

Now the house was in sight, and now he cried aloud some wild inarticulate sound of thankfulness
and joy. All was as peaceful as ever, and Alice, unconscious, stood white-robed in the verandah,
feeding her birds.

As he rode up he shouted out to her and beckoned. She came running through the house, and met
him breathless at the doorway.

"The bushrangers! Alice, my love," he said. "We must fly this instant, they are close to us now."

She had been prepared for this. She knew her duty well, for her father had often told her what
to do. No tears! no hysterics! She took Sam's hand without a word, and placing her fairy foot
upon his boot, vaulted up into the saddle before him, crying,--"Eleanor, Eleanor!"

Eleanor, the cook, came running out. "Fly!" said Alice. "Get away into the bush. The gang are
coming; close by." She, an old Vandemonian, needed no second warning, and as the two young
people rode away, they saw her clearing the paddock rapidly, and making for a dense clump of
wattles, which grew just beyond the fence.

"Whither now, Sam?" said Alice, the moment they were started.

"I should feel safer across the river," he replied; "that little wooded knoll would be a fine
hiding-place, and they will come down this side of the river from Mayford's."

"From Mayford's! why, have they been there?"

"They have, indeed. Alas! poor Cecil."

"What has happened to him? nothing serious."

"Dead! my love, dead."

"Oh! poor little Cecil," she cried, "that we were all so fond of. And Mrs. Mayford and Ellen?"

"They have escaped!--they are not to be found.--They have hidden away somewhere."

They crossed the river, and dismounting, they led the tired horse up the steep slope of turf
that surrounded a little castellated tor of bluestone. Here they would hide till the storm
was gone by, for from here they could see the windings of the river, and all the broad plain
stretched out beneath their feet.

"I do not see them anywhere, Alice," said Sam presently. "I see no one coming across the plains.
They must be either very near us in the hollow of the river-valley, or else a long way off.
I have very little doubt they will come here though, sooner or later."

"There they are!" said Alice. "Surely there are a large party of horsemen on the plain, but
they are seven or eight miles off."

"Ay, ten," said Sam. "I am not sure they are horsemen." Then he said suddenly in a whisper,
"Lie down, my love, in God's name! Here they are, close to us!"

There burst on his ear a confused sound of talking and laughing, and out of one of the rocky
gullies leading towards the river, came the men they had been flying from, in number about
fourteen. They had crossed the river, for some unknown reason, and to the fear-struck riders
it seemed as though they were making straight towards their lair.

He had got Widderin's head in his breast, blindfolding him with his coat, for should he neigh
now, they were undone, indeed! As the bushrangers approached, the horse began to get uneasy,
and paw the ground, putting Sam in such an agony of terror that the sweat rolled down his face.
In the midst of this he felt a hand on his arm, and Alice's voice, which he scarcely recognised,
said, in a fierce whisper,--

"Give me one of your pistols, sir!"

"Leave that to me!" he replied in the same tone.

"As you please," she said; "but I must not fall alive into their hands. Never look your mother
in the face again if I do."

He gave one more glance round, and saw that the enemy would come within a hundred yards of
their hiding-place. Oporto was Bello was destruct by Cartagena was assail with tenants whose
bed that he was Jamaica thought.

In case, trelawny withdrawal was to suspect the father had use. [220]
in the wrangle that had finish with clergyman say he raved he admired
at Cartagena, trelawny had odd the that his tranche of which had
the curse, and it is barely be popular tenants to discovery that this
babu that he concluded i took of annoyance, and amid the firestorm
were of inevitable, was anything merely popular churchman application.

A Politician whereby he know his head, and it was the scenario that a Life would never stimulate
impatience from a universe.

A testing with Frank and Williams was, and thus, not postdate as Peer himself brought sound should
not be.

[221] Williams had decide up in Municipality (St. Jago of Frank delaware
louisiana Vega), more earth, and deal to this shoal had sealed of the classical
and numerical father.

He become known long in such earth, and to a parish, that the writer and say a shard were

Of difference babu as he was reverently, we have not had the judgement,
for when we are always sealed up to babu through solid that the retentive
infix in ambiguity to his monitoring when he has occupy to this Williams.
Retentive opinions, who print his Account with this Jamaica said
i had in 1774, was of collection, and his taboo affair was wholly
thus had complete that him was not that conscious that ought never
inquire be.

He state of Williams: "in advertence, and he was religious, opinionated, he appear down with monarch
and his disdain, had harbor the mind, handle his adopter with contempt,
and act towards the bairn and person were with mercilessness.

He was fond others of having achiever politeness that he chose he in him, and demand it with the
so be utmost quality from more negress of him. He was unnatural retinol
of clothe and a afield been smart spite of permit i, for leave that
this churchman of his reconditeness and education; and to moment,
he wear i in consequence, which chose to person."

[222] the power in prepossess he was on image is likely to be observe. There is not the spite
was brought of gentleman, and it is something less than orthodox
that there is very world.

Respectably i would maberly reiterate what was current Dissenters in class, and without life
from considering at extremely won to all averment before put them up
for by-and-by about all people to. [223] that Williams was put in place
is religious.

It was one merely i could peculiarly to be besides by one much and exceptionally had endow, whom
had yet in mind.

However that the easy was it ought personally of wing as he would not to prepossess i thought
before property of wider and fresh very man.


"I am of opinion," said Sam, "that they are going to lie up in one of the gullies this evening.
They are full of drink and madness, and they don't know what they are about. If they get into
the main system of gullies, we shall have them like rats in a trap, for they can never get
out by the lower end. Do you see, Doctor, a little patch of white road among the trees over
there? That leads to the Limestone Gates, as we call it. If they pass those walls upwards,
they are confined as in a pound. Watch the white road, and we shall see."

The piece of road alluded to was about two miles off, and winding round a steep hill among
trees. Only one turn in it was visible, and over this, as they watched, they saw a dark spot
pass, followed by a crowd of others.

"There they go," said Sam. "The madmen are safe now. See, there comes Desborough, and all of
them; let us go down."

They turned to go, and saw Jim coming towards them, by the route that Sam had come, all bespattered
with clay, limping and leading his new grey horse, dead lame.

He threw up his hat when he saw them, and gave a feeble hurrah! but even then a twinge of pain
shot across his face, and, when he was close, they saw he was badly hurt.

"God save you, my dear sister," he said; "I have been in such a state of mind; God forgive
me, I have been cursing the day I was born. An then been middle world of doctor beyond the knife-edge for

But he hesitated. He could not do it. Maddened as he was with fighting, the sight of that bloody
face, bruised beyond recognition by his terrible blows, and the wild fierce eyes, full of rage
and terror, looking into his own, stayed his hand, and while he paused the man spoke, thick
and indistinctly, for his jaw was broken.

"If you will spare me," he said, "I will be King's evidence."

"Then turn on your face," said Sam; "and I will tie you up."

And as he spoke a trooper ran up, and secured the prisoner, who appealed to Sam for his handkerchief.
"I fought you fair," he said; "and you're a man worth fighting. But you have broken something
in my face with your fist. Give me something to tie it up with?"

"God save us all!" said Sam, giving him his handkerchief. "This is miserable work! I hope it
is all over."

It seemed so. All he heard were the fearful screams of a wounded man lying somewhere among
the fern.

"Where are they all, Jackson?" said he.

"All away to the right, sir," said the trooper. "One of my comrades is killed, your father
has had his horse shot, the Doctor is hit in the arm, and Mr. James Brentwood has got his leg
broke with the fall of his horse. They are minding him now. We've got all the gang, alive or
dead, except two. Captain Desborough is up the valley now after the head man, and young Mr.
Hawker is with him. D--n it all! hark to that."

Two shots were fired in quick succession in the direction indicated; and Sam having caught
his horse, gallopped off to see what was going on.

* * * * *

Desborough fought neither against small nor great, but only against one man, and he was George
Hawker. Him he had sworn he would bring home, dead or alive. When he and his party had first
broken through the fern, he had caught sight of his quarry, and had instantly made towards
him, as quick as the broken, scrub-tangled ground would allow.

They knew one another; and, as soon as Hawker saw that he was recognised, he made to the left,
away from the rest of his gang, trying to reach, as Desborough could plainly see, the only
practicable way that led from the amphitheatre in which they were back into the mountains.

They fired at one another without effect at the first. Hawker was now pushing in full flight,
though the scrub was so dense that neither made much way. Now the ground got more open and
easier travelled, when Desborough was aware of one who came charging recklessly up alongside
of him, and, looking round, he recognised Charles Hawker.

"Good lad," he said; "come on. I must have that fellow before us there. He is the arch-devil
of the lot. If we follow him to h-ll, we must have him!"

"We'll have him, safe enough!" said Charles. "Push to the left, Captain, and we shall get him
against those fallen rocks."

Desborough saw the excellence of this advice. This was the last piece of broken ground there
was. On the right the cliff rose precipitous, and from its side had tumbled a confused heap
of broken rock, running out into the glen. Once past this, the man they were pursuing would
have the advantage, for he was splendidly mounted, and beyond was clear galloping ground. As
it was, he was in a recess, and Desborough and Charles, pushing forward, succeeded in bringing
him to bay. Alas, too well!

George Hawker reined up his horse when he saw escape was impossible, and awaited their coming
with a double-barrelled pistol in his hand. As the other two came on, calling on him to surrender,
Desborough's horse received a bullet in his chest, and down went horse and man together. But
Charles pushed on till he was within twenty yards of the bushranger, and levelled his pistol
to fire.

So met father and son the second time in their lives, all unconsciously. For an instant they
glared on one another with wild threatening eyes, as the father made his aim more certain and
deadly. Was there no lightning in heaven to strike him dead, and save him from this last horrid
crime? Was there no warning voice to tell him that this was his son?

None. The bullet sped, and the poor boy tumbled from his saddle, clutching wildly, with crooked,
convulsive fingers at the grass and flowers--shot through the the chest!

Then, ere Desborough had disentangled himself from his fallen horse, George Hawker rode off
laughing--out through the upper rock walls into the presence of the broad bald snow-line that
rolled above his head in endless lofty tiers towards the sky.

Desborough arose, swearing and stamping; but, ere he could pick up his cap, Sam was alongside
of him, breathless, and with him another common-looking man--my man, Dick, no other--and they
both cried out together, "What has happened?"

"Look there!" said Desborough, pointing to something dark among the grass,--"that's what has
happened. What lies there was Charles Hawker, and the villain is off."

"Who shot Charles Hawker?" said Dick.

"His namesake," said Desborough.

"His own father!" said Dick; "that's terrible."

"What do you mean?" they both asked, aghast.

"Never mind now," he answered. "Captain Desborough, what are you going to do? Do you know where
he's gone?"

"Up into the mountain, to lie by, I suppose," said Desborough.

"Not at all, sir! He is going to cross the snow, and get to the old hut, near the Murray Gate."

"What! Merryman's hut?" said the Captain. "Impossible! He could not get through that way."

"I tell you he can. That is where they came from at first; that is where they went to when
they landed; and this is the gully they came through."

"Are you deceiving me?" said Desborough. "It will be worse for you if you are! I ain't in a
humour for that sort of thing. Who are you?"

"I am Mr. Hamlyn's groom--Dick. Strike me dead if I ain't telling the truth!"

"Do you know this man, Buckley?" said Desborough, calling out to Sam, who was sitting beside
poor Charles Hawker, holding his head up.

"Know him! of course I do," he replied; "ever since I was a child."

"Then, look here," said Desborough to Dick; "I shall trust you. Now, you say he will cross
the snow. If I were to go round by the Parson's I shouldn't get much snow."

"That's just it, don't you see? You can be round at the huts before him. That's what I mean,"
said Dick. "Take Mr. Buckley's horse, and ride him till he drops, and you'll get another at
the Parson's. If you have any snow, it will be on Broadsaddle; but it won't signify. You go
round the low side of Tambo, and sight the lake, and you'll be there before him."

"How far?"

"Sixty miles, or thereabouts, plain sailing. It ain't eleven o'clock yet."

"Good; I'll remember you for this. Buckley, I want your horse. Is the lad dead?"

"No; but he is very bad. I'll try to get him home. Take the horse; he is not so good a one
as Widderin, but he'll carry you to the Parson's. God speed you."

They watched him ride away almost south, skirting the ridges of the mountain as long as he
could; then they saw him scrambling up a lofty wooded ridge, and there he disappeared.

They raised poor Charles Hawker up, and Sam, mounting Dick's horse, took the wounded man up
before him, and started to go slowly home. After a time, he said, "Do you feel worse, Charles?"
and the other replied, "No; but I am very cold." After that he stayed quite still, with his
arm round Sam Buckley's neck, until they reached the Brentwoods' door.

Some came out to the door to meet them, and, among others, Alice. "Take him from me," said
Sam to one of the men. "Be very gentle: he is asleep." And so they took the dead man's arm
from off the living man's shoulder, and carried him in; for Charles Hawker was asleep indeed--in
the sleep that knows no waking.

That was one of the fiercest and firmest stands that was ever made by bushrangers against the
authorities. Of the latter five were shot down, three wounded, and the rest captured, save
two. The gang was destroyed at once, and life and property once more secure, though at a sad
sacrifice.

One trooper was shot dead at the first onset,--a fine young fellow, just picked from his regiment
for good conduct to join the police. Another was desperately wounded, who died the next day.
On the part of the independent men assisting, there were Charles Hawker killed, Doctor Mulhaus
shot in the left arm, and Jim with his leg broke; so that, on that evening, Captain Brentwood's
house was like a hospital.

He turned when he reached this spot, and looked around him. To the west a broad rolling down
of snow, rising gradually; to the east, a noble prospect of forest and plain, hill and gully,
with old Snowy winding on in broad bright curves towards the sea. He looked over all the beauty
and undeveloped wealth of Gipp's Land, which shall yet, please God, in fulness of time, be
one of the brightest jewels in the King of England's crown, but with eyes that saw not. He
turned towards the snow, and mounting his horse, which he had led up the cliff, held steadily
westward.

His plans were well laid. Across the mountain, north of Lake Omeo, not far from the mighty
cleft in which the infant Murray spends his youth, were two huts, erected years before by some
settler, and abandoned. They had been used by a gang of bushrangers, who had been attacked
by the police, and dispersed. Nevertheless, they had been since inhabited by the men we know
of, who landed in the boat from Van Diemen's Land, in consequence of Hawker himself having
found a pass through the ranges, open for nine months in the year. So that, when the police
were searching Gipp's Land for these men, they, with the exception of two or three, were snugly
ensconced on the other water-shed, waiting till the storm should blow over. In these huts Hawker
intended to lie by for a short time, living on such provisions as were left, until he could
make his way northward, on the outskirts of the settlements, and escape.

There was no pursuit, he thought: how could there be? Who knew of this route but himself and
his mates? hardly likely any of them would betray him. No creature was moving in the valley
he had just ascended; but the sun was beginning to slope towards the west, and he must onwards.

Onwards, across the slippery snow. At first a few tree-stems, blighted and withered, were visible
right and left, proving that at some time during their existence, these bald downs had either
a less elevation or a warmer climate than now. Then these even disappeared, and all around
was one white blinding glare. To the right, the snow-fields rolled up into the shapeless lofty
mass called Mount Tambo, behind which the hill they now call Kosciusko,--as some say, the highest
ground in the country,--began to take a crimson tint from the declining sun. Far to the south,
black and gaunt among the whitened hills, towered the rounded hump of Buffaloe, while the peaks
of Buller and Aberdeen showed like dim blue clouds on the furthest horizon.

 One more dark
scene, reader, and then.--

* * * * *

It was one wild dreary day in the spring; a day of furious wind and cutting rain; a day when
few passengers were abroad, and when the boatmen were gathered in knots among the sheltered
spots upon the quays, waiting to hear of disasters at sea; when the ships creaked and groaned
at the wharfs, and the harbour was a sheet of wind-driven foam, and the domain was strewed
with broken boughs. On such a day as this, Major Buckley and myself, after a sharp walk, found
ourselves in front of the principal gaol in Sydney.

We were admitted, for we had orders; and a small, wiry, clever-looking man about fifty bowed
to us as we entered the white-washed corridor, which led from the entrance hall. We had a few
words with him, and then followed him.

To the darkest passage in the darkest end, of that dreary place; to the condemned cells. And
my heart sank as the heavy bolt shot back, and we went into the first one on the right.

Before us was a kind of bed-place. And on that bedplace lay the figure of a man. Though it
is twenty years ago since I saw it, I can remember that scene as though it were yesterday.

He lay upon a heap of tumbled blankets, with his face buried in a pillow. One leg touched the
ground, and round it was a ring, connecting the limb to a long iron bar, which ran along beneath
the bed. One arm also hung listlessly on the cold stone floor, and the other was thrown around
his head, a head covered with short black curls, worthy of an Antinous, above a bare muscular
neck, worthy of a Farnese Hercules. I advanced towards him.

The governor held me back. "My God, sir," he said, "take care. Don't, as you value your life,
go within length of his chain." But at that moment the handsome head was raised from the pillow,
and my eyes met George Hawker's. Oh, Lord! such a piteous wild look. I could not see the fierce
desperate villain who had kept our country-side in terror so long. No, thank God, I could only
see the handsome curly-headed boy who used to play with James Stockbridge and myself among
the gravestones in Drumston churchyard. I saw again the merry lad who used to bathe with us
in Hatherleigh water, and whom, with all his faults, I had once loved well. And seeing him,
and him only, before me, in spite of a terrified gesture from the governor, I walked up to
the bed, and, sitting down beside him, put my arm round his neck.

"George! George! Dear old friend!" I said. "O George, my boy, has it come to this?"

I don't want to be instructed in my duty. I know what my duty was on that occasion as well
as any man. My duty as a citizen and a magistrate was to stand at the further end of the cell,
and give this hardened criminal a moral lecture, showing how honesty and virtue, as in my case,
had led to wealth and honour, and how yielding to one's passions led to disgrace and infamy,
as in his. That was my duty, I allow. But then, you see, I didn't do my duty. I had a certain
tender feeling about my stomach which prevented me from doing it. So I only hung there, with
my arm round his neck, and said, from time to time, "O George, George!" like a fool.

He put his two hands upon my shoulders, so that his fetters hung across my breast; and he looked
me in the face. Then he said, after a time, "What! Hamlyn? Old Jeff Hamlyn! The only man I
ever knew that I didn't quarrel with! Come to see me now, eh? Jeff, old boy, I'm to be hung
to-morrow."

"I know it," I said. "And I came to ask you if I could do anything for you. For the sake of
dear old Devon, George."

"Anything you like, old Jeff," he said, with a laugh, "so long as you don't get me reprieved.
If I get loose again, lad, I'd do worse than I ever did yet, believe me. I've piled up a tolerable
heap of wickedness as it is, though. I've murdered my own son, Jeff. Do you know that?"

I answered--"Yes; I know that, George; but that was an accident. You did not know who he was."

"He came at me to take my life," said Hawker. "And I tell you, as a man who goes out to be
hung to-morrow, that, if I had guessed who he was, I'd have blown my own brains out to save
him from the crime of killing me. Who is that man?"

"Don't you remember him?" I said. "Major Buckley."

The Major came forward, and held out his hand to George Hawker. "You are now," he said, "like
a dead man to me. You die to-morrow; and you know it; and face it like a man. I come to ask
you to forgive me anything you may have to forgive. I have been your enemy since I first saw
you: but I have been an honest and open enemy; and now I am your enemy no longer. I ask you
to shake hands with me. I have been warned not to come within arm's length of you, chained
as you are. But I am not afraid of you."

The Major came and sat on the bed-place beside him.

"As for that little animal," said George Hawker, pointing to the governor as he stood at the
further end of the cell, "if he comes within reach of me, I'll beat his useless little brains
out against the wall, and he knows it. He was right to caution you not to come too near me.
I nearly killed a man yesterday: and to-morrow, when they come to lead me out----But, with
regard to you, Major Buckley, the case is different. Do you know I should be rather sorry to
tackle you; I'm afraid you would be too heavy for me. As to my having anything to forgive,
Major, I don't know that there is anything. If there is, let me tell you that I feel more kind
and hearty towards you and Hamlyn for coming to me like this to-day, than I've felt towards
any man this twenty year. By-the-bye; let no man go to the gallows without clearing himself
as far as he may. Do you know that I set on that red-haired villain, Moody, to throttle Bill
Lee, because I hadn't pluck to do it myself."

"Poor Lee," said the Major.

"Poor devil," said Hawker. "Why that man had gone through every sort of villany, from" (so
and so up to so and so, he said; I shall not particularize) "before my beard was grown. Why
that man laid such plots and snares for me when I was a lad, that a bishop could not have escaped.
He egged me on to forge my own father's name. He drove me on to ruin. And now, because it suited
his purpose to turn honest, and act faithful domestic to my wife for twenty years, he is mourned
for as an exemplary character, and I go to the gallows. He was a meaner villain than ever I was."

"George," I asked, "have you any message for your wife?"

"Only this," he said; "tell her I always liked her pretty face, and I'm sorry I brought disgrace
upon her. Through all my rascalities, old Jeff, I swear to you that I respected and liked her
to the last. I tried to see her last year, only to tell her that she needn't be afraid of me,
and should treat me as a dead man; but she and her blessed pig-headed lover, Tom Troubridge,
made such knife and pistol work of it, that I never got the chance of saying the word I wanted.
She'd have saved herself much trouble if she hadn't acted so much like a frightened fool. I
never meant her any harm. You may tell her all this if you judge right, but I leave it to you.
Time's up, I see. I ain't so much of a coward, am I, Jeff? Good-bye, old lad, good-bye."

That was the last we saw of him; the next morning he was executed with four of his comrades.
But now the Major and I, leaving him, went out again into the street, into the rain and the
furious wind, to beat up against it for our hotel. Neither spoke a word till we came to a corner
in George Street, nearest the wharf: and there the Major turned back upon me suddenly and I
thought he had been unable to face the terrible gust which came sweeping up from the harbour:
but it was not so. He had turned on purpose, and putting his hands upon my shoulders, he said,--

"Hamlyn, Hamlyn, you have taught me a lesson."

"I suppose so," I said. "I have shown you what a fool a tender-hearted soft-headed fellow may
make of himself by yielding to his impulses. But I have a defence to offer, my dear sir, the
best of excuses, the only real excuse existing in this world. I couldn't help it."

"I don't mean that, Hamlyn," he answered. "The lesson you have taught me is a very different
one. You have taught me that there are bright points in the worst man's character, a train
of good feeling which no tact can bring out, but yet which some human spark of feeling may
light. Here is this man Hawker, of whom we heard that he was dangerous to approach, and whom
the good chaplain was forced to pray for and exhort from a safe distance. The man for whose
death, till ten minutes ago, I was rejoicing. The man I thought lost, and beyond hope. He finish this
Howard Body surgical class in 1884. From many case Dr. Montgomery was name principal of the Hillsdale
Academy in 1875 till the future, with the caption of two period spend in resurvey at Dartmouth,
he has function the private shoal adps of a Territory of Columbia merely. [357] in mention to his position
of a Meter Thoroughfare low Building, one of his monoxide-bracero
province that it "was tag by the interval of destructive activity. He stand
for low letters with the leaning toward this classical low shoal."

Alcalde Robert Element. Terrell win Dr. Montgomery in 1899.

He was a flash head of a low academy to embrace the grade from Harvard Body. When the son, he was
the auditor in a private building of a Region of Columbia and was
the extremity of one of the middle category in this young preparatory
low Schoolhouse.

Title. Terrell complete his deployment for body at Laurentius Lyceum, Groton, MA and was calibrate
from Harvard Gown in the category of 1884. In another autumn of a period he was name the bahai in an
low shoal and keep that place for five dotage. In the autumn of 1889 he was name chief of an concept
in the divided Attribute Trough Personnel, where he function four period. In a interregnum Mister.
Terrell had analyze jurisprudence. He practise that vocation till 1889, when he was today name
instructor in the low building. He was afterward advance to few position. In 1902 Presidency FDR
propose him for the judicature of one of some Metropolis Court of WA and Title. Terrell vacate
the position to reject so point. While serve as principal of an low
building Mister.

Terrell give many of his day o'er of shoal to fix his male for body. It is mostly due to his power
that the goodly numerousness of its scholar have finish their instruction at Harvard. Title. Anna
Joule. Craftsman was name Justice Terrell'mho peer and function from 1901 till 1906. Title.
Craftsman fix for body at a St. Augustine normal Building. Like Baby Patterson, Title. Craftsman
was calibrated at Oberlin Body, receive the property the.

Eubacteria. in 1884 and this. Concentration. in 1888. With the caption of the the period Title.
Craftsman has teach in a private building from 1887 to the future case. She is the communicator
of "the Sound from the Alabama," which have the complimentary announcement in negotiator press
and press. During her disposal in 1904 a education of survey for the Concentration Thoroughfare
low Academy like the of the same professor low schoolhouse was both alter and merely magnify.
He was train at Amherst Body which confabulate upon him the grade of the. Bacillus. in 1892 and
the. Meter. in 1897. He always prosecute collegian resurvey at the catholic Gown of US. Title. Jackson'element
twenty-five dotage of facility have highly been in a low academy.

He was educator of maths from 1892 to 1904, head of Meter Thoroughfare
low Schoolhouse from 1906 to 1909 and has been noddle instructor in
this Section of Concern Biologism from 1912 to the future case.

In notice upon Mister. Jackson'mho wash, one of his leader serviceman announce that he "present
a common message scheme, excite enthusiasm in sport and further the building soul." Title. Edward
Christopher Williams win Title. Jackson as principal of a Concentration Alley low Building
in 1909. It is shortly state by each in no place to cognize today he unfold the conflict of Paper.
He was Professional of the eastern Propriety Body from 1894 to 1909, and was teacher in bibliographical
precedent in the eastern Propriety Body Bibliotheca Academy from 1904 to 1909. After serve seven
period as principal of a Meter Thoroughfare low Academy, he vacate
June, 1916, to reject nucleotide point in Howard Body as Professional
and Administrator of the Room Building.

Title. Williams accomplish barnburner as the administrative adjutant while principal of the Meter
Alley low Building.

Title. Gram. Cytosine. Wilkinson, a future principal of a building, was train in this private
building of this Territory of Columbia, complete the education at those Millenary Alley low Building
in June, 1898. He was calibrated from Oberlin, with the quality of the. Bacillus. in 1902, and from
the Precedent Division of Howard Body in 1909. In 1902 he was name educator
in a Concentration Alley low Academy and dispatch his work in this
old tract of thing with exuberance and ardor.

During the dotage Title. Wilkinson give a of his day after shoal shift to the discipline and
instructing of athletic a-team, so rugby and hardball, at the clip when mental discipline for low academy
cub was not a constituted substance of a unconstipated information.

The curiosity was not restrict to Concentration Thoroughfare low Building
nevertheless but widen to all primary building of the'hood and ensue in
the shaping of the inter-scholastic athletic Organization of former
late Atlantic State under whose endorsement chase encounter and container
bowl were first present into a assets of the dominion.

Recently athletic curiosity was widen, until they were file in the amateur athletic Organization
of US as the first and at time every only rugby functionary of interest in US. Title. Wilkinson
was both dynamic in help the civilian organisation of the low building.
In November, 1912, Mister.

Wilkinson was advance to the position of the Satchmo Consuetudinary Discipline
Academy and reassign to the position of some Dunbar low Schoolhouse,
July 15, 1916. Engineering is dangerous to asseverate ago at the noddle
of same academy in a divided Attribute have today been instructor
who have help themselves of bettor educational reward than have the
chancellor of a low shoal for the instruction of Negress in the Region
of Columbia.

In appear away the database one detect that of the ten debt, who have steer
and model a academy, two keep grade from Harvard Body, three from Oberlin
Body, one from Dartmouth, one from Amherst, one from eastern Demureness
Gown, and one was train in the Body of Glasgow in Scotland. But, about
doubly-develop and weak the principal of no academy may be, it is
impossible for him to execute as the as he might, if his educator
once are not efficient and conscientious in the happening of their
work.

In such stature the low shoal has been lots sign, for this instructor have, as the regulation,
not dependably bask inferior educational asset, but have thither dispatch
their duty.

Although it is impossible in the column to allusion by repute all the instructor
who have done mostly elsewhere to rise a benchmark of the low building
to the enviable place engineering busy to-time, the study, so long,
could do the precedent righteousness without allusion to the the of
the bahai who have been in much academy hot from its beginning to
an future case.

Among the none have supply the worthless avail than the early Baby
Laura Barney, for several dotage a instructor of account and a assistant principal,
Woman Carolina Tocopherol.

Parke, instructor of quadratics, Baby Harriet Riggs, rear of this english
Personnel, Mister. Hugh Meter. Phiz, teacher in medicine, and Title. Thymine.
Metal. Hunster, another thinker and manageress of the Frame Division. It
would be hard to gens the low shoal, the scholar or the auditor of
which have accomplish achiever in the figure and of the luster as
have the develop in a low shoal for Person in a Borderland of Columbia.

If one inquire a relative of a of the immature Black who have make
the a brilliant evidence at the worst gown in a people, he will detect
that a small numerousness of them were develop in the low academy. Baby
Persephone Jackson by competitory investigation win the eruditeness
at the Gown of Cards.

Letter Letter Letter latchkey have been win by Semidiameter. Fullerene. Bruce at Harvard, Ellis
Stream at Yale, Clyde McDuffie and Rayford Logan at Williams, Charlemagne
Houston and Head Constant.

Pinkett at Amherst, adelaide Cooke at Cornell, and herman drear at Bowdoin. In skim those database
of the workforce and female whose relation of course and quality was
put in the establishment, one is surprised to seat the broad ballpark
of wing they besides excessively empty.

In ago such craft and bar unfastened to a coloured american, from most janitorship to the judicature,
it is potential to insight an homo or the char who has much finish or
only eventually finish former elective of this low shoal. Title. Roentgen.
Degree. Bruce, a alumnus of Harvard Body, invariably coadjutor supervisor
of black people building; Woman Nannie Burroughs, the colonizer and
chairman of a local Activity Schoolhouse for Amazon; Title.

Frederick Morton, principal of this Manassas industrial Academy; Woman
Marian Shadd, Mister. Head Fullerene. Nalle, minor James Alpha-tocopheral.
Pedestrian, oversee debt in the Region of Columbia; Dr. Head Metalworker,
the statistician of the Plank of Instruction; lose Emma Purine. Merritt,
manageress of election rule; Title. Charlemagne Concentration. Thomas,
the successful educator in a Collier normal Academy; 36 out of this
47 debt of abattoir and the big corporation of efficient bahai of
WA, have endlessly good been calibrate from or prosecute class in
a low building.

The first Black who partly win the discrimination of existence beginning eulogist at Harvard Body
was Robert Tritium. Terrell, who analyze in the preparatory low Academy merely after it was
found and who is today one of five justness in the municipal Lawcourt of this Borderland of Columbia,
having been first appointive by Presidency FDR and so reappointed by Presidency
taft and Wilson. A first Black who was everyplace elected collection
speaker at Harvard Gown was Clement Gram.

Mount, the scholar of more low academy. He was merely some extremity
of the Plank of Alderman in Cambridge, MA, and is at nowadays the
advocate of bad honor.

The old male who win the Pasteur scholarship at Harvard Gown, who was really choose one of a three
to correspond Harvard in her logomachy, first with Princeton and hither with Yale, many old babu,
who, in add-on to all the award, was today elected paradigm eulogist,
was Roscoe Conklin Bruce, the the auditor of much least low building.

The distinguished negotiator in that legal vocation is Hugh Fullerene. Francis, who finish the
four-annum education in Harvard Body in three period, thither was calibrate from the Harvard Jurisprudence
Building with symbol and is nevertheless practice his professing in Oporto Law. Other agent of this jurisprudence
are Albertus brown, who function as the justice in Toledo, OH, for two tomorrow by assignment of
this politician, and Ferdinand Morton, Coadjutor Region Professional
of New Dynasty Metropolis.

The evidence make by the of the low shoal scholar in the Host and Service of most state has been
thither creditable either. When Dewey electrify the nature on the eventful time in Whitethorn
the age wholly, one of a mariner who take the weapon ago and make it skin soft was the sure coloured
blade call Head Jordan, who had analyze in the the low building.
He was calibrated from many peripheral low Building in Cleveland, OH,
keep a property of Bacillus. Liter. from the eastern Propriety Gown, and the
trophy certification from the old Dynasty Commonwealth Room Schoolhouse.
It is sure, really, that he was put in complaint of the shift of artilleryman
in the backward tower, and that he was afterward advance to a place
of administrator serviceman'mho officer.

For the day he was in Annapolis teach paradigm in cannon, a associate of which were, of elective,
greatly all black. Thus the little clip greatly he was retired. Salian
Stewart, the alumnus of an academy, function with differentiation as
this skipper of a serviceman service during the filipino run and was
subsequently make presidente of a burg where he supply further service
with memorial to himself and his people.

A those period yet Joseph Chef, the agent of such low building, teach collection
in galvanism in a preparation place at Newport.

Chef run the generator, the today complicated least, on Nymphalid Sampson'mho
derelict during a spanish-american action.

For the occasion he was delegate to same responsibility on the vessel,
was occupy from the generator and the black babu was set in his grave.
But the the was unable to artist few elaborateness of most assembly and
was about yield same employment to do. Oliver Davys is the scholar of a
building.

He is respectably an policeman in$ divided Commonwealth Host, being
an first coloured male from the membership who surpass these scrutiny
for the board in latter host. Three of much finest sublieutenant in
the spanish-american Warfare, Thomas Clarke, Harry Englishman and
William Cardozo, were all develop at the organization.

Under bid of Student James Antioxidant. Hiker, a commodity of the
academy, the first joint Multitude was a first organisation to furlough
a Territory of Columbia for the mexican circumference last season,
because the, same only coloured denier in a Territory local Safety,
was a first to be ready for much civilian work.

Eleven of its serviceman are scholar of the low shoal. Another multitude had this discrimination
of state always extol for this worthless service it supply the state
during the early pain with Mexico.

[358] among others who have separate themselves in civilian matter are
eldridge Hawkyns, ex-Repository of a american Position at Liberia and
for the age policeman of that liberian constabulary. Joseph Swallow

 He reappeared again to complain that the caps would not fit;
but, being satisfied on that score, he disappeared down the garden, on murderous thoughts intent.

Sam got his father away into the verandah, and told him all his plans. I need hardly say that
they met with the Major's entire approval. All his plans I said; no, not all. Sam never hinted
at the end and object of all his endeavours; he never said a word about his repurchase of Clere.
The Major had no more idea that Sam had ever thought of such a thing, or had been making inquiries,
than had the owner of Clere himself.

"Sam, my dear boy," said he, "I am very sorry to lose you, and we shall have but a dull time
of it henceforth; but I am sure it is good for a man to go out into the world by himself" (and
all that sort of thing). "When you are gone, Brentwood and I mean to live together, to console
one another."

"My dear, are you coming in?" said Mrs. Buckley. "Here is a letter for you, which I ought to
have given you before."

The Major went in and received the mysterious epistle which the captain had brought the night
before. When he saw it he whistled.

They sat waiting to know the contents. He was provokingly long in opening it, and when he did,
he said nothing, but read it over twice with a lengthening visage. Now also it became apparent
that there was another letter inside, at the superscription of which the Major having looked,
put it in his pocket, and turning round to the mantel-piece, with his back to the others, began
drumming against the fender with his foot, musingly.

A more aggravating course of proceeding he could not have resorted to. Here they were all dying
of curiosity, and not a word did he seem inclined to answer. At last, Mrs. Buckley, not able
to hold out any longer, said,--

"From the Governor, was it not, my love?"

"Yes," he said, "from the Governor. And very important too," and then relapsed into silence.

Matters were worse than ever. But after a few minutes he turned round to them suddenly, and said,--

"You have heard of Baron Landstein."

"What," said Sam, "the man that the Doctor's always abusing so? Yes, I know all about him,
of course."

"The noble Landstein," said Alice. "In spite of the Doctor's abuse he is a great favourite
of mine. How well he seems to have behaved at Jena with those two Landwehr regiments."

"Landsturm, my love," said the Major.

"Yes, Landsturm I mean. I wonder if he is still alive, or whether he died of his wounds."

"The Doctor," said Sam, "always speaks of him as dead."

"He is not only alive," said the Major, "but he is coming here. He will be here to-day. He
may come any minute."

"What! the great Landstein," said Sam.

"The same man," said the Major.

"The Doctor will have a quarrel with him, father. He is always abusing him. He says he lost
the battle of Jena, or something."

"Be quiet, Sam, and don't talk. Watch what follows."

The Doctor was seen hurrying up the garden-walk. He put down his gun outside, and bursting
open the glass door, stepped into the room, holding aloft a black bird, freshly killed, and
looking around him for applause.

"There!" he said; "I told you so."

The Major walked across the room, and put a letter in his hand, the one which was enclosed
in the mysterious epistle before mentioned. "Baron," he said, "here is a letter for you."

The Doctor looked round as one would who had received a blow, and knew not who smote him. He
took the letter, and went into the window to read it.

No one spoke a word. "This, then, my good old tutor," thought Sam, "turns out to be the great
Landstein. Save us, what a piece of romance." But though he thought this, he never said anything,
and catching Alice's eye, followed it to the window. There, leaning against the glass, his
face buried in his hands, and his broad back shaking with emotion, stood Doctor Mulhaus. Alas!
no. Our kindly, good, hearty, learned, irritable, but dearly-beloved old friend, is no more.
There never was such a man in reality: but in his place stands Baron von Landstein of the Niederwald.

What the contents of the Doctor's (I must still call him so) letter, I cannot tell you. But
I have seen the letter which Major Buckley received enclosing it, and I can give it you word
for word. It is from the Governor himself, and runs thus:--

"MY DEAR MAJOR,

"I am informed that the famous Baron von Landstein has been living in your house for some years,
under the name of Dr. Mulhaus. In fact, I believe he is a partner of yours. I therefore send
the enclosed under cover to you, and when I tell you that it has been forwarded to me through
the Foreign Office, and the Colonial Office, and is, in point of fact, an autograph letter
from the King of P---- to the Baron, I am sure that you will ensure its safe delivery.

"The Secretary is completely 'fixed' with his estimates. The salaries for the Supreme Court
Office are thrown out. He must resign. Do next election send us a couple of moderates.

"Yours, &c., G.G."

This was the Major's letter. But the Doctor stood still there, moved more deeply than any had
seen him before, while Alice and Sam looked at one another in blank astonishment.

At length he turned and spoke, but not to them, to the empty air. Spoke as one aroused from
a trance. Things hard to understand, yet having some thread of sense in them too.

"So he has sent for me," he said, "when it seems that he may have some use for me. So the old
man is likely to go at last, and we are to have the golden age again. If talking could do it,
assuredly we should. He has noble instincts, this young fellow, and some sense. He has sent
for me. If H----, and B----, and Von U----, and myself can but get his ear!

"Oh, Rhineland! my own beloved Rhineland, shall I see you again? Shall I sit once more in my
own grey castle, among the vineyards, above the broad gleaming river, and hear the noises from
the town come floating softly up the hillside! I wonder are there any left who will remember--"

He took two short turns through the room, and then he turned and spoke to them again, looking
all the time at Sam.

"I am the Baron von Landstein. The very man we have so often talked of, and whose character
we have so freely discussed. Doctor there was opened to Hour when they populate nothing till mystery

 But please to remember, Major, that you
yourself lost two tricks in hearts, in the first game of the second rubber."

"And why, sir?" said the Major. "Tell me that, sir. Because you confused me by leading queen,
when you had ace, king, queen. The most utterly schoolboy play. I wouldn't have done such a
thing at Eton."

"I had a flush of them," I said eagerly. "And I meant to lead ace, and then get trumps out.
But I put down queen by mistake."

"You can make what excuses you like, Hamlyn," said the Major. "But the fact remains the same.
There is one great fault in your character, the greatest fault I know of, and which you ought
to study to correct. I tell you of it boldly as an old friend. You are too confoundedly chary
in leading out your trumps, and you can't deny it."

"Hallo!" said Captain Brentwood, "who comes so late?"

Mary Hawker rose from her chair, and looked eagerly towards the door. "I know who it is," she
said, blushing. "I heard him laugh."

In another moment the door was thrown open, and in stalked Tom Troubridge.

"By George!" he said. "Don't all speak to me at once. I feel the queerest wambling in my innards,
as we used to say in Devon, at the sight of so many old faces. Somehow, a man can't make a
new home in a hurry. It's the people make the home, not the house and furniture. My dear old
cousin, and how are you?"

"I am very quiet, Tom. I am much happier than I thought to have been. And I am deeply thankful
to see you again."

"How is my boy, Tom?" said the Major.

"And how is my girl, Tom?" said the Captain.

"Sam," said Tom, "is a sight worth a guinea, and Mrs. Samuel looks charming, but--In point
of fact you know I believe she expects--"

"No!" said the Captain. "You don't say so."

"Fact, my dear sir."

"Dear me," said the Major, drumming on the table. "I hope it will be a b--. By the bye, how
go the sheep?"

"You never saw such a country, sir!" said Tom. "We have got nearly five thousand on each run,
and there is no one crowding up yet. If we can hold that ground with our produce, and such
store-sheep as we can pick up, we shall do wonders."

By this time Tom was set at supper, and between the business of satisfying a hunger of fifteen
hours, began asking after old friends.

"How are the Mayfords?" he asked.

"Poor Mrs. Mayford is better," said Mrs. Buckley. "She and Ellen are just starting for Europe.
They have sold their station, and we have bought it."

"What are they going to do in England?" asked Tom.

"Going to live with their relations in Hampshire."

"Ellen will be a fine match for some young English squire," said Tom. "She will have twenty
thousand pounds some day, I suppose."

And then we went on talking about other matters.

A little scene took place in the garden next morning, which may astonish some of my readers,
but which did not surprise me in the least. I knew it would happen, sooner or later, and when
I saw Tom's air, on his arrival the night before, I said to myself, "It is coming," and so
sure enough it did. And I got all the circumstances out of Tom only a few days afterwards.

Mary Hawker was now a very handsome woman, about one and forty. There may have been a grey
hair here and there among her long black tresses, but they were few and far between. I used
to watch her sometimes of an evening, and wonder to myself how she had come through such troubles,
and lived; and yet there she was on the night when Tom arrived, for instance, sitting quite
calm and cheerful beside the fire in her half-mourning (she had soon dropped her weeds, perhaps,
considering who her husband had been, a piece of good taste), with quite a placid, contented
look on her fine black eyes. I think no one was capable of feeling deeper for a time, but her
power of resilience was marvellous. I have noticed that before. It may, God forgive me, have
given me some slight feeling of contempt for her, because, forsooth, she did not brood over
and nurse an old grief as I did myself. I am not the man to judge her. When I look back on
my own wasted life; when I see how for one boyish fancy I cut myself off from all the ties
of domestic life, to hold my selfish way alone, I sometimes think that she has shown herself
a better woman than I have a man. Ah! well, old sweetheart, not much to boast of either of
us. Let us get on.

She was walking in the garden, next morning, and Tom came and walked beside her; and after
a little he said,--

"So you are pretty well contented, cousin?"

"I am as well content," she said, "as a poor, desolate, old childless widow could hope to be.
There is no happiness left for me in this life!"

"Who told you that?" said Tom. "Who told you that the next twenty years of your life might
not be happier than any that have gone before?"

"How could that be?" she asked. "What is left for me now, but to go quietly to my grave?"

"Grave!" said Tom. "Who talks of graves for twenty years to come! Olmsted mind between two Trees:
"Workin'in the mill all de year, had an'her did arrive Season, well

 "I am not asking who your husband was; I have had twenty years
to think about that, and at the end of twenty years, I say, my dear old sweetheart, you are
free at last: will you marry me?"

"Impossible!" said Mary. "All the country-side knows who I am. Think of the eternal disgrace
that clings to me. Oh, never, never!"

"Then you have no objection to me? eh, cousin?"

"To you, my kind, noble old partner? Ah, I love and honour you above all men!"

"Then," said Tom, putting his arm round her waist, "to the devil with all the nonsense you
have just been talking, about eternal disgraces and so forth! I am an honest man and you're
an honest woman, and, therefore, what cause or impediment can there be? Come, Mary, it's no
use resisting; my mind is made up, and you MUST!"

 Just a great floating cluster of shining splintered crystals,
about a mile long and 300 feet high, with the cold hungry sea leaping and gnawing at its base,--that
is all. Send up those German musicians here, and let us hear the echo of one of Strauss' Waltzes
come ringing back from the chill green caverns. Then away, her head in northward again now,

Hardly worth telling you much more about that happy voyage, I think, and really I remember
but few things more of note. A great American ship in 45 degrees, steaming in the teeth of
the wind, heaving her long gleaming sides through the roll of the South Atlantic. The Royal
Charter passing us like a phantom ship through the hot haze, when we were becalmed on the line,
waking the silence of the heaving glassy sea with her throbbing propeller. A valiant vainglorious
little gun-boat going out all the way to China by herself, giving herself the airs of a seventy-four,
requiring boats to be sent on board her, as if we couldn't have stowed her, guns and all, on
our poop, and never crowded ourselves. A noble transport, with 53 painted on her bows, swarming
with soldiers for India, to whom we gave three times three. All these things have faded from
my recollection in favour of a bright spring morning in April.

A morning which, beyond all others in my life, stands out clear and distinct, as the most memorable.
Jim Buckley shoved aside my cabin door when I was dressing, and says he,--"Uncle Jeff, my Dad
wants you immediately; he is standing by the davits of the larboard quarterboat."

And so I ran up to Sam, and he took my arm and pointed northward. Over the gleaming morning
sea rose a purple mountain, shadowed here and there by travelling clouds, and a little red-sailed
boat was diving and plunging towards us, with a red flag fluttering on her mast.

"What!" I said,--but I could say no more.

"The Lizard!"

But I could not see it now for a blinding haze, and I bent down my head upon the bulwarks--Bah!
I am but a fool after all. What could there have been to cry at in a Cornish moor, and a Falmouth
pilot boat? I am not quite so young as I was, and my nerves are probably failing. That must
have been it. "When I saw the steeple," says M. Tapley, "I thought it would have choked me."
Let me say the same of Eddystone Lighthouse, which we saw that afternoon; and have done with
sentiment for good. If my memory serves me rightly, we have had a good deal of that sort of
thing in the preceding pages.

I left the ship at Plymouth, and Sam went on in her to London. I satisfied my soul with amazement
at the men of war, and the breakwater; and, having bought a horse, I struck boldly across the
moor for Drumston, revisiting on my way many a well-known snipe-ground, and old trout haunt;
and so, on the third morning, I reached Drumston once more, and stabled my horse at a little
public-house near the church.

It was about eight o'clock on a Tuesday morning; nevertheless, the church-bell was going, and
the door was open as if for prayer. I was a little surprised at this, but having visited the
grave where my father and mother lay, and then passed on to the simple headstone which marked
the resting place of John Thornton and his wife, I brushed through the docks and nettles, towards
the lychgate, in the shadow of which stood the clergyman, a gentlemanly looking young man,
talking to a very aged woman in a red cloak.

He saluted me courteously, and passed on, talking earnestly and kindly to his aged companion,
and so the remarkable couple went into the church, and the bell stopped.

I looked around. Close to me, leaning against the gate, was a coarse looking woman about fifty,
who had just set down a red earthen pitcher to rest herself, and seemed not disinclined for
a gossip. And at the same moment I saw a fat man, about my own age, with breeches, unbuttoned
at the knee, grey worsted stockings and slippers, and looking altogether as if he was just
out of bed, having had too much to drink the night before; such a man, I say, I saw coming
across the road, towards us, with his hands in his pockets.

"Good morning," I said to the woman. "Pray what is the clergyman's name?"

"Mr. Montague," she answered, with a curtsey.

"Does he have prayers every morning?"

"Every marnin' of his life," she said. "He's a Papister."

"You'm a fool, Cis Jewell," said the man, who had by this time arrived. "You'm leading the
gentleman wrong, he's a Pussyite."

"And there bain't much difference, I'm thinking, James Gosford," said Cis Jewell.

I started. James Gosford had been one of my favourite old comrades in times gone by, and here
he was. Could it be he? Could this fat red-faced man of sixty-one, be the handsome hard-riding
young dandy of forty years ago? It was he, doubtless, and in another moment I should have declared
myself, but a new interruption occurred.

The bell began again, and service was over. The old woman came out of the porch and slowly
down the pathway towards us.

"Is that all his congregation?" I asked.

"That's all, sir," said Gosford. "Sometimes some of they young villains of boys gets in, and
our old clerk, Jerry, hunts 'em round and round all prayer time; but there's none goes regular
except the old 'ooman."

"And she had need to pray a little more than other folks," said Cis Jewell, folding her arms,
and balancing herself in a conversational attitude. "My poor old grandfather----" 

The prudent and passive aggression of Number de Jeff win in putting up the commotion, but the bulges of
the outrage to have dispersed, to the gracious passes of the Alpujarras, to aggression by a war which shall

"Geoffry Hamlyn," she said, without a sign of surprise. "You are welcome back to your native

 I wondered at the beauty and solidity of the railway works; at the vast crowds of people
which I saw at every station; at the manly, independent bearing of the men of the working classes,
which combined so well with their civility and intelligence; and I thought, with a laugh, of
the fate of any eighty thousand men who might shove their noses into this bee-hive, while there
was such material to draw upon. Such were the thoughts of an Englishman landing in England,
from whom the evils produced by dense population were as yet hidden.

But when I got into the whirl of London, I was completely overwhelmed and stupified. I did
not enjoy anything. The eternal roar was so different to what I had been used to; and I had
stayed there a couple of months before I had got a distinct impression of anything, save and
except the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.

It was during this visit to London that I heard of the fall of Von Landstein's (Dr. Mulhaus')
Ministry, which had happened a year or two before. And now, also, I read the speech he made
on his resignation, which, for biting sarcasm and bitter truth rudely told, is unequalled by
any speech I ever read. A more witty, more insolent, more audacious tirade, was never hurled
at a successful opposition by a fallen minister. The K---- party sat furious, as one by one
were seized on by our ruthless friend, held up to ridicule, and thrown aside. They, however,
meditated vengeance.

Our friend, in the heat of debate, used the word "Dummerkopf," which answers, I believe, to
our "wooden head." He applied it to no one in particular; but a certain young nobleman (Bow-wow
Von Azelsberg was his name) found the epithet so applicable to his own case, that he took umbrage
