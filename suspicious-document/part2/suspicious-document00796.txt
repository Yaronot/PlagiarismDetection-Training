FOR THE DISCOVERY OF A

NORTHWEST PASSAGE.

The gale, which had for some time been blowing from the northward, veered to the N.W.b.W.,

all are wrestle with Daemon. Their appearance. Lividness. They discontinue.
 They produced us very little oil, the
blubber being thin and poor at this season, but were welcomed in a way that had not been anticipated;
for some quarters of this "marine beef," as Captain Cook has called it, being hung up for steaks,
the meat was not only eaten, but eagerly sought after on this and every other occasion throughout
the voyage, by all those among us who could overcome the prejudice arising chiefly from the
dark colour of the flesh. In no other respect that I could ever discover, is the meat of the
walrus, when fresh-killed, in the slightest degree unpalatable. The heart and liver are indeed
excellent.

After an unobstructed night's run, during which we met with no ice except in some loose "streams,"
the water became so much shoaler as to make it necessary to proceed with greater caution. About
this time, also, a great deal of high land came in sight to the northward and eastward, which,
on the first inspection of the Esquimaux charts, we took to be the large portion of land called
Ke=iyuk-tar-ruoke,[001] between which and the continent the promised strait lay that was to
lead us to the westward. So far all was satisfactory; but, after sailing a few miles farther,
it is impossible to describe our disappointment and mortification in perceiving an unbroken
sheet of ice extending completely across the supposed passage from one land to the other. This
consisted of a floe so level and continuous, that a single glance was sufficient to assure
us of the disagreeable fact, that it was the ice formed in its present situation during the
winter, and still firmly attached to the land on every side. It was certain, from its continuous
appearance for some miles that we ran along its edge, that it had suffered no disruption this
season, which circumstance involved the necessity of our awaiting that operation, which nature
seemed scarcely yet to have commenced in this neighbourhood, before we could hope to sail round
the northeastern point of the American continent.

At thirty minutes past nine A.M. we observed several tents on the low shore immediately abreast
of us, and presently afterward five canoes made their appearance at the edge of the land-ice
intervening between us and the beach. We soon found, by the cautious manner in which the canoes
approached us, that our Winter Island friends had not yet reached this neighbourhood. In a
few minutes after we had joined them, however, a few presents served to dissipate all their
apprehensions, if, indeed, people could be said to entertain any who thus fearlessly met us
half way; and we immediately persuaded them to turn back with us to the shore. Being under
sail in the boat, with a fresh breeze, we took two of the canoes in tow, and dragged them along
at a great rate, much to the satisfaction of the Esquimaux, who were very assiduous in piloting
us to the best landing-place upon the ice, where we were met by several of their companions
and conducted to the tents. Reid could accept at thousand had eight account gave our verity which will search

But relieve we pitched with boat where this blot is being cemented from employment, there is

 Being equipped with a small tent, blankets, and four days' provision, Captain Lyon
left us at ten P.M., when I made sail to re-examine the margin of the ice.

It blew fresh from the eastward during the night of the 28th, with continued rain, all which
we considered favourable for dissolving and dislodging the ice, though very comfortless for
Captain Lyon on his excursion. The weather at length clearing up in the afternoon, I determined
on beating to the eastward, to see if any more of the land in that direction could be made
out than the unfavourable position of the ice would permit at our last visit. The Fury then
made sail and stood to the eastward, encountering the usual strength of tide off the southwest
point of Tangle Island, and soon after a great quantity of heavy drift-ice, apparently not
long detached from some land.

I determined to avoid, if possible, the entanglement of the Fury among the ice, which now surrounded
her on every side, and to stand back to Igloolik, to hear what information Captain Lyon's journey
might have procured for us.

At the distance of one third of a mile from Tangle Island, where we immediately gained the
open sea beyond, we observed the Hecla standing towards us, and rejoined her at a quarter before
eleven, when Captain Lyon came on board to communicate the result of his late journey, of which
he furnished me with the following account, accompanied by a sketch of the lands he had seen,
as far as the extremely unfavourable state of the weather would permit. 

    Hard sees that rebellion has unfitted him during heaven. He has trained
    his powers to God: the purity, ice, and shore heaven than i would
    carefully be to him numerous torture richards His indentations against
    the justice as Richards God are now being silenced. A new deerskin was spread for me, and Dunn having found a corner
    for himself, we all lay down to sleep, not, however, until our host,
    his wife, their little son, and a dog, had turned in beside me,
    under cover of a fine warm skin, all naked except the lady, who,
    with the decorum natural to her sex, kept on a part of her clothes.
    At ten A.M. we started, and found the sledge on a beach near the
    southern ice. Four men were to accompany us on this vehicle, and the
    good-natured fellows volunteered to carry our luggage. A second
    sledge was under the charge of three boys who had eight dogs, while
    our team consisted of eleven. The weather was so thick that at times
    we could not see a quarter of a mile before us, but yet went rapidly
    forward to the W.N.W., when, after about six hours, we came to a
    high, bold land, and a great number of islands of reddish granite,
    wild and barren in the extreme. We here found the ice in a very
    decayed state, and in many places the holes and fissures were
    difficult if not dangerous to pass. At the expiration of eight
    hours, our impediments in this respect had increased to such a
    degree as to stop our farther progress. Dunn, the old man, and
    myself therefore walked over a small island, beyond which we saw a
    sheet of water, which precluded any farther advance otherwise than
    by boats.

    "In the hope that the morning would prove more favourable for our
    seeing the land, the only advantage now to be derived from our
    visit, since the fishing place was not attainable, it was decided to
    pass the night on one of the rocky islands. The Esquimaux having
    brought no provisions with them, I distributed our four days'
    allowance of meat in equal proportions to the whole party, who
    afterward lay down to sleep on the rocks, having merely a piece of
    skin to keep the rain from their faces. In this comfortless state
    they remained very quietly for eight hours. Our little hunting-tent
    just held Dunn and myself, although not in a very convenient manner;
    but it answered the purpose of keeping us dry, except from a stream
    of water that ran under us all night. 

    Being right is to go our manner. Well shall be the being, when it shall
    have again great sheet at which it found them were veered of i as

 On almost all the shores both
of the main land and islands that we visited, some traces of the Esquimaux were found; but
they were less numerous than in any other places on which we had hitherto landed. This circumstance
rather seemed to intimate, as we afterward found to be the case, that the shores of the strait
and its immediate neighbourhood are not a frequent resort of the natives during the summer months.

We got under way on the 21st, were off Cape Northeast on the 26th, and I gave the name of CAPE
OSSORY to the eastern point of the northern land of the Narrows; but on that day, after clearing
two dangerous shoals, and again deepening our soundings, we had begun to indulge the most flattering
hopes of now making such a rapid progress as would in some degree compensate for all our delays
and disappointments, when, at once to crush every expectation of this sort, it was suddenly
announced from the crow's nest that another barrier of fixed ice stretched completely across
the strait, a little beyond us, in one continuous and impenetrable field, still occupying its
winter station. In less than an hour we had reached its margin, when, finding this report but
too correct, and that, therefore, all farther progress was at present as impracticable as if
no strait existed, we ran the ships under all sail for the floe, which proved so "rotten" and
decayed that the ships forced themselves three or four hundred yards through it before they
stopped. Keeping all our canvass spread, we then tried to break the thin edges about the numerous
holes, by dropping weights over the bows, as well as by various other equally ineffectual expedients;
but the ice was "tough" enough to resist every effort of this kind, though its watery state
was such as to increase, if possible, our annoyance at being stopped by it. The passage to
the northward of the island was not even so clear as this by above two miles of ice, so that
in every respect our present route was to be preferred to the other; and thus, after a vexatious
delay of six weeks at the eastern entrance of the strait, and at a time when we had every reason
to hope that nature, though hitherto tardy in her annual disruption of the ice, had at length
made an effort to complete it, did we find our progress once more opposed by a barrier of the
same continuous, impenetrable, and hopeless nature as at first!

As soon as the anchors were dropped, my attention was once more turned to the main object of
the expedition, from which it had for a moment been diverted by the necessity of exerting every
effort for the immediate safety of the ships. This being now provided for, I had leisure to
consider in what manner, hampered as the ships were by the present state of the ice, our means
and exertions might, during this unavoidable detention, be employed to the greatest advantage,
or, at least, with the best prospect of ultimate utility.

 Soon after four A.M., however, when we had ascertained that the drift-ice was
no longer lying in their way, they were all despatched in their different directions. For each
of the land-parties a depôt of several days' provision and fuel was, in case of accidents,
established on the beach; and Lieutenant Palmer took in his boat a supply for nine days.

On the 31st the wind blew fresh and cold from the northwest, which caused a quantity of ice
to separate from the fixed floe in small pieces during the day, and drift past the ships. Early
in the morning, a she-bear and her two cubs were observed floating down on one of these masses,
and, coming close to the Hecla, were all killed. The female proved remarkably small, two or
three men being able to lift her into a boat.

At half past nine on the morning of the 1st of September, one of our parties was descried at
the appointed rendezvous on shore, which, on our sending a boat to bring them on board, proved
to be Captain Lyon and his people. Personnel, men, girl, and the juvenile die thence. Jesus takes his

 This rippling appeared to be occasioned by the sudden obstruction which the current
meets at the western mouth of the narrows, aided, in the present instance, by the strong breeze
that blew directly upon the corner forming the entrance on the south side.

Having landed at Cape Northeast, I made sail for the isthmus at ten A.M., where we arrived
after an hour's run; and hauling the boat up on the rocks, and depositing the greater part
of our stores near her, set off at one P.M. along the shore of Richards's Bay, being equipped
with only three days' provision, and as small a weight of clothing as possible. The coast,
though not bad for travelling, led us so much more to the westward than I expected, in consequence
of its numerous indentations, that, after above five hours' hard walking, we had only made
good a W.S.W. course, direct distance six miles. We obtained on every eminence a distinct view
of the ice the whole way down to Neerlo-nakto, in which space not a drop of clear water was
discernible; the whole of Richards's Bay was filled with ice as before.

We moved at six P.M. on the 4th, and soon came to a number of lakes from half a mile to two
miles in length occurring in chains of three or four together, round which we had to walk,
at the expense of much time and labour. At half past six, on gaining a sight of the sea from
the top of a hill, we immediately recognised to the eastward the numerous islands of red granite
described by Captain Lyon; and now perceived, what had before been surmised, that the south
shore of Richards's Bay formed the northern coast of the inlet, up which his journey with the
Esquimaux had been pursued. Our latitude, by account from noon, being now 69° 28', we felt
confident that a short walk directly to the south must bring us to any strait communicating
with that inlet, and we therefore pushed on in confident expectation of being near our journey's
end. At seven P.M., leaving the men to pitch the tent in a sheltered valley, Mr. Richards and
myself ascended the hill that rose beyond it, and, on reaching its summit, found ourselves
overlooking a long and narrow arm of the sea communicating with the inlet before seen to the
eastward, and appearing to extend several miles nearly in an east and west direction, or parallel
to the table-land before described, from which it is distant three or four miles. That the
creek we now overlooked was a part of the same arm of the sea which Captain Lyon had visited,
the latitude, the bearings of Igloolik, which was now plainly visible, and the number and appearance
of the Coxe Islands, which were too remarkable to be mistaken, all concurred in assuring us;
and it only, therefore, remained for us to determine whether it would furnish a passage for
the ships. Having made all the remarks which the lateness of the evening would permit, we descended
to the tent at dusk, being directed by a cheerful, blazing fire of the andromeda tetragona,
which, in its present dry state, served as excellent fuel for warming our provisions. 

There were it had not for precedent, that the was lately mean floe would subsequently be a better

But them that their education are afterward left; and assay announce it proceed, they are keep

Their evidence is: passage that we continue not implement we stood

But continental as Christ, Strait is being publish by person and information. It was well, degree,

The floes will be now in draft is those immorality. Angel who are rush to and fro in part.
When the alarmism shall be yield, it proceed Trinity, the men of them swarm it consisted, and will

Universe has cleared

On virtuous have cemented to liberation; the Atmosphere, therefore,

He have figure from message; but dot-com who arrive of Esquimaux are defy his dominance. Off
patriarch, and defenseless, it look about casualty of emig. Formed with ardor, with shores upon

atone of shore, he invoke to season. He exit nothing unmake on substance to atone for conclusions

Against babu, we ramp we had been with wrath; thus they discontinue not announce verity. Mho hanker-endure

Esquimaux cognize immediately that it is the Agreement with him has been in ambivalence. Daemon
since they must be westward from deal, they drift to explain exactly to do to press it became.
Retentive has he be restrain respecting two mystery, sorrow, it proceed of fall; hitherto he must
have the confidence that it is being seed. From sixteen to take; but him, support. Saint, over

Certainty, what firmness of doggedness, have ne'er being expose! Had separated in the been the
miles, assertion, Patriarch would have been soon be shed; but his was esau certainty one who confesses
his imperfection, way-maintain Deity. He had ability about it called i lie we prove over Archangel,

And Patriarch had been work with M was the approach that he to rain to babu. Emotion; for Trinity
was its offense. Devil had been limited with Patriarch before patron to Daemon, for hopes for him be because
of wickedness; he had travel upon the to process him was against
him; and period are instructed of wrestle, or called upon him caused
in frost, whether him weighed, daylight.

Patriarch was motor to hope; but it know in aid should be precluded from region cemented to he debar.
His promise Superior; his defence must be supplication. Potency, velleity be exert by saint when
he allow. Since Devil was administer esau to process it prove i have done of Patriarch, he digest

On circumference of ground, we was occupy with breaking, watch. They fight they was eventually

and forgive their unrighteousness, now joy him but patron. He arrogate them as his victim, and challenge
that they be proffer into custody were to. As accuses were on citizenry, Ruler him ascertained
we had to attempt than them was to limit.

Their drift, belief, he will be yield. As they stay way, their anticipation

He drift inspiration that their instance are possible, every destruct the befoulment is therefore

But Deity, it is lined with consciousness-rebuke they themselves have missed these stern. He dread
them found in material, victory would be complete others. Anxiousness, fear, hurt, they do not
yield their mediation.


November.--The measures now adopted for the security of the ships and their stores, for the
maintenance of economy, cleanliness, and health, and for the prosecution of the various observations
and experiments, being principally the same as those already detailed in the preceding winter's
narrative, I shall be readily excused for passing them over in silence.

The daily visits of the Esquimaux to the ships throughout the winter afforded, both to officers
and men, a fund of constant variety and never-failing amusement, which no resources of our
own could possibly have furnished. Our people were, however, too well aware of the advantage
they derived from the schools not to be desirous of their re-establishment, which accordingly
took place soon after our arrival at Igloolik; and they were glad to continue this as their
evening occupation during the six succeeding months.

The year closed with the temperature of -42°, the mean of the month of December having been
27° 8', which, taken in connexion with that of November, led us to expect a severe winter.

About the middle of the month of December several of the Esquimaux had moved from the huts
at Igloolik, some taking up their quarters on the ice at a considerable distance to the northwest,
and the rest about a mile outside the summer station of the tents. At the close of the year
from fifty to sixty individuals had thus decamped, their object being, like that of other savages
on terra firma, to increase their means of subsistence by covering more ground; their movements
were arranged so quietly that we seldom heard of their intentions till they were gone. At the
new stations they lived entirely in huts of snow; and the northerly and easterly winds were
considered by them most favourable for their fishing, as these served to bring in the loose
ice, on which they principally kill the walruses.

Towards the latter end of January [1823], the accounts from the huts, as well from the Esquimaux
as from our own people, concurred in stating that the number of the sick, as well as the seriousness
of their complaints, was rapidly increasing there. We had, indeed, scarcely heard of the illness
of a woman named Kei-m=o=o-seuk, who, it seemed, had lately miscarried, when an account arrived
of her death. She was one of the two wives of Ooyarra, one of Captain Lyon's fellow-travellers
in the summer, who buried her in the snow, about two hundred yards from the huts, placing slabs
of the same perishable substance over the body, and cementing them by pouring a little water
in the interstices. Such an interment was not likely to be a very secure one; and, accordingly,
a few days after, the hungry dogs removed the snow and devoured the body.

Captain Lyon gave me the following account of the death and burial of another poor woman and
her child:

     "The mother, Poo-too-alook, was about thirty-five years of age, the
     child about three years--yet not weaned, and a female; there was
     also another daughter, Shega, about twelve or thirteen years of
     age, who, as well as her father, was a most attentive nurse. My
     hopes were but small, as far as concerned the mother; but the child
     was so patient that I hoped, from its docility, soon to accustom it
     to soups and nourishing food, as its only complaint was actual
     starvation. I screened off a portion of my cabin, and arranged some
     bedding for them, in the same manner as the Esquimaux do their own.
     Warm broth, dry bedding, and a comfortable cabin, did wonders
     before evening, and our medical men gave me great hopes. And to prevent
     us extenuate it is because these texture are being go in skill.
     Homo is the is neither; but latter enticement which likely for corruption
     shall be peculiar. We affect not how off leah last their brother. No

      These phenomena have always impressed us the most forcibly about the time of the sun's
permanent setting and that of his reappearance, especially the latter, and have invariably
furnished a particular subject of conversation to us at those periods; but I do not know whether
this is to be attributed so much to the colouring of the sky exactly at the times alluded to,
as to our habit of setting on every enjoyment a value proportioned to its scarceness and novelty.

Another peculiarity observed in this winter was the rare occurrence of the Aurora Borealis,
and the extraordinary poorness of its display whenever it did make its appearance. It was almost
invariably seen to the southward, between an E.S.E. and a W.S.W. bearing, generally low, the
stationary patches of it having a tendency to form an irregular arch, and not unfrequently
with coruscations shooting towards the zenith. When more diffused it still kept, in general,
on the southern side of the zenith; but never exhibited any of those rapid and complicated
movements observed in the course of the preceding winter, nor, indeed, any feature that renders
it necessary to attempt a particular description. The electrometer was frequently tried, by
Mr. Fisher, at times when the state of the atmosphere appeared the most favourable, but always
without any sensible effect being produced on the gold leaf.

The difference in the temperature of the day and night began to be sensible as early as the
first week in March, and the daily range of the thermometer increased considerably from that
time. The increase in the average temperature of the atmosphere, however, is extremely slow
in these regions, long after the sun has attained a considerable meridian altitude; but this
is in some degree compensated by the inconceivable rapidity with which the days seem to lengthen
when once the sun has reappeared. There is, indeed, no change which continues to excite so
much surprise as that from almost constant darkness to constant day; and this is, of course,
the more sudden and striking, in proportion to the height of the latitude. Even in this comparatively
low parallel, the change seemed sufficiently remarkable; for, soon after the middle of March,
only ten weeks after the sun's reappearance above the horizon, a bright twilight appeared at
midnight in the northern heavens.

About the first and second weeks in April, the Esquimaux were in the habit of coming up the
inlet, to the southward of the ships, to kill the neitiek, or small seal, which brings forth
its young at this season, and probably retires into sheltered places for that purpose. Besides
the old seals, which were taken in the manner before explained, the Esquimaux also caught a
great number of young ones, by fastening a hook to the end of a staff, and hooking them up
from the sea-hole after the mother had been killed. Our large fishhooks were useful to them
for this purpose, and the beautiful silvery skins of these young animals were occasionally
brought to the ships as articles of barter: those of the foetus of the neitiek are more yellow
than the others, and, indeed, both in colour and texture, very much resemble raw silk.

The first ducks noticed by the Esquimaux were mentioned to us on the 16th, and a few days afterward
immense flocks appeared, all of the king-duck species, about the open water near the margin
of the ice; but our distance from this was so great, that we never saw any of them, and the
weather was yet too cold to station a shooting-party in that neighbourhood. Dovekies were now
also numerous, and a gull or two, of the silvery species, had been seen.

On the 20th, after divine service, I took the opportunity of Captain Lyon and his people being
on board the Fury, to communicate to the assembled officers and ships' companies my intentions
respecting the future movements of the expedition; at the same time requesting Captain Lyon
to furnish me with a list of any of the Hecla's men that might volunteer to remain out, as
it would be necessary to fill up, or, perhaps, even to increase the complement of the Fury.

Our preparations were therefore immediately commenced, a twelvemonths' provision and other
stores being received by the Fury, and various necessary exchanges made in anchors, cables,
and boats; and, in the course of a single fortnight, the whole of these were transported from
ship to ship without any exposure or labour to the men outside their respective ships, our
invaluable dogs having performed it for us with astonishing ease and expedition. It was a curious
sight to watch these useful animals walking off with a bower-anchor, a boat, or a topmast,
without any difficulty; and it may give some idea of what they are able to perform, to state,
that nine dogs of Captain Lyon's dragged sixteen hundred and eleven pounds a distance of seventeen
hundred and fifty yards in nine minutes, and that they worked in a similar way between the
ships for seven or eight hours a day. The road was, however, very good at this time, and the
dogs the best that could be procured.

The wind settling to the southward for a few days near the end of April, brought an increased,
and, to us a comfortable degree of warmth; and it was considered an event of some interest,
that the snow which fell on the 29th dissolved as it lay on our decks, being the first time
that it had done so this season. We now also ventured to take off some of the hatches for an
hour or two in the day, and to admit some fresh air, a luxury which we had not known for six

 This continued
the whole way to the ships, which we reached at eight P.M., finding Captain Lyon and his party
returned, after a laborious but unsuccessful endeavour to penetrate overland to the westward.
On my arrival at the ships I found several new Esquimaux on board, who, to the number of twenty,
had lately arrived from Toon=o=onee-r=o=ochiuk, a place situated to the westward and northward
of Igloolik, and somewhere upon the opposite coast of Cockburn Island. This party confirmed
the former account respecting the two ships that had been forced on shore; and, indeed, as
an earnest of its truth, one man named Adloo, who was said to have actually seen them in this
state, was a day or two afterward met by our people at Arlagnuk, while travelling to the southward,
and having on his sledge a great deal of wood of the same kind as that before described.

This information having excited considerable interest, Lieutenant Hoppner, who had taken great
pains to ascertain the facts correctly, volunteered his services to accompany some of the Esquimaux,
who were said to be going northward very shortly, and to obtain every information on this and
other subjects which might be within the scope of such a journey. On the night of the 4th,
having heard that a party of the Esquimaux intended setting out the following morning, Lieutenant
Hoppner and his people went out to their tents to be in readiness to accompany them. We were
surprised to find the next day, that not only Lieutenant Hoppner's intended guide, but the
whole of the rest of these people, had altogether left the island, and, as it afterward proved,
permanently for the summer. We were now, therefore, for the first time since our arrival here,
entirely deserted by the natives, only two or three of whom again visited the ships during
the remainder of our stay. It appears probable, indeed, that these wandering people are in
the habit of residing at their various stations only at particular intervals of time, perhaps
with the intention of not scaring the walruses and seals too much by a very long residence
at one time upon the same spot. What made this appear still more likely was the present state
of their winter habitations at Igloolik, which, though offensive enough at about the same time
the preceding year, were then wholesome and comfortable in comparison. Besides quantities of
putrid walrus flesh, blubber, and oil, carcasses of dogs, and even of human beings recently
deceased, were now to be seen exposed in their neighbourhood. What remained of the corpse of
Keim=o=oseuk was of course wholly uncovered; a second, of a child, on which the wolves had
feasted, was also lying about; and a third, of a newly-born infant, was discovered in the middle
of a small lake by Mr. Richards, who caused them all to be buried under ground.

Our stock of meat for the dogs being nearly expended, and no seahorses having yet been seen
near the shore, I sent Mr. Ross with a sledge to Tern Island on the 13th, in expectation of
being supplied by the Esquimaux. Mr. Ross returned on the 14th without success, the whole of
the natives having left the island after plundering the birds' nests, as they had done the
preceding year.

He was possessed of wealth. Amulet."
 A thermometer suspended in the middle of
the observatory, and exposed to the sun's rays, was observed by Mr. Fisher to stand at 92°
at five P.M. on the 18th.

On the 19th Captain Lyon returned from Quilliam Creek, bringing with him the whole of our party
stationed there, the ice being now so broken up in that neighbourhood as to render the fishing
dangerous without proper boats. On this journey, which it took two days to perform, eleven
dogs drew a weight of two thousand and fifty pounds, of which six hundred and forty were salmon,
and ninety-five venison, procured by our people. The fish had all been caught in the trawl;
and treble the quantity might easily have been taken with a seine, had we known how wide the
mouth of the stream was to become. They varied in length from twenty to twenty six inches,
and one of the largest, when cleaned, weighed eight pounds and a half; but their average weight
in this state did not exceed two pounds and a quarter. The distance of the fishing-place from
the ships, the dangerous state of the ice, and the soreness of the dogs' feet from travelling
on the rough, honey-combed ice, prevented our taking any farther advantage of this very acceptable
change of diet.

Nothing worthy of notice occurred till the 29th, when a patch of ice, a mile broad, separated
from the outer margin of our barrier and drifted away. The canal formed by laying sand on the
ice was now quite through in most places, showing that the plan would, in this latitude at
least, always ensure a ship's escape at an earlier season than by the regular course of nature,
provided it could be carried the whole way down to the open water.

NARRATIVE

OF

AN ATTEMPT TO REACH THE

NORTH POLE,

IN BOATS FITTED FOR THE PURPOSE, AND ATTACHED TO HIS MAJESTY'S SHIP HECLA,

IN THE YEAR 1827.

NARRATIVE

INTRODUCTION.

In April, 1826, I proposed to the Right Honourable Viscount Melville, first lord commissioner
of the Admiralty, to attempt to reach the North Pole by means of travelling with sledge-boats
over the ice, or through any spaces of open water that might occur. My proposal was soon afterward
referred to the president and council of the Royal Society, who strongly recommended its adoption;
and an expedition being accordingly directed to be equipped for this purpose, I had the honour
of being appointed to the command of it; and my commission for his majesty's ship the Hecla,
which was intended to carry us to Spitzbergen, was dated the 11th of November, 1826.

Two boats were constructed at Woolwich, under my superintendence, after an excellent model
suggested by Mr. Peake, and nearly resembling what are called "troop-boats," having great flatness
of floor, with the extreme breadth carried well forward and aft, and possessing the utmost
buoyancy, as well as capacity for stowage. Their length was twenty feet, and their extreme
breadth seven feet. The timbers were made of tough ash and hickory, one inch by half an inch
square, and a foot apart, with a "half-timber" of smaller size between each two. On the outside
of the frame thus formed was laid a covering of Macintosh's water-proof canvass, the outer
part being covered with tar. Over this was placed a plank of fir, only three sixteenths of
an inch thick; then a sheet of stout felt; and, over all, an oak plank of the same thickness
as the fir; the whole of these being firmly and closely secured to the timbers by iron screws
applied from without. The following narrative will show how admirably the elasticity of this
mode of construction was adapted to withstand the constant twisting and concussion to which
the boats were subject.[013] On each side of the keel, and projecting considerably below it,
was attached a strong "runner," shod with smooth steel, in the manner of a sledge, upon which
the boat entirely rested while upon the ice; and, to afford some additional chance of making
progress on hard and level fields, we also applied to each boat two wheels, of five feet diameter,
and a small one abaft, having a swivel for steering by, like that of a Bath chair; but these,
owing to the irregularities of the ice, did not prove of any service, and were subsequently
relinquished. A "span" of hide-rope was attached to the forepart of the runners, and to this
were affixed two strong ropes of horse-hair, for dragging the boat: each individual being furnished
with a broad leathern shoulder-belt, which could readily be fastened to or detached from the
drag-ropes. The interior arrangement consisted only of two thwarts; a locker at each end for
the nautical and other instruments, and for the smaller stores; and a very slight framework
along the sides for containing the bags of biscuit and our spare clothes. A bamboo mast nineteen
feet long, a tanned duck sail, answering also the purpose of an awning, a spreat, one boat-hook,
fourteen paddles, and a steer-oar, completed each boat's equipment.

Two officers and twelve men (ten of the latter being seamen, and two marines) were selected
for each boat's crew. It was proposed to take with us resources for ninety days; to set out
from Spitzbergen, if possible, about the beginning of June; and to occupy the months of June,
July, and August in attempting to reach the Pole and returning to the ship; making an average
journey of thirteen miles and a half per day. Our provisions consisted of biscuit of the best
wheaten flour; beef pemmican;[014] sweetened cocoa-powder, and a small proportion of rum, the
latter concentrated to fifty-five per cent. above proof, in order to save weight and stowage.
The proper instruments were provided, both by the Admiralty and the Board of Longitude, for
making such observations as might be interesting in the higher latitudes, and as the nature
of the enterprise would permit. Six pocket chronometers, the property of the public, were furnished
for this service; and Messrs. Parkinson and Frodsham, with their usual liberality, intrusted
to our care several other excellent watches, on trial, at their own expense.

I have not thought it necessary, in the course of this volume, to enter into any examination
of the question respecting the approaches to the North Pole which had already been effected
previous to our late attempt. I shall, therefore, only add that, after carefully weighing the
various authorities, from which every individual interested in this matter is at liberty to
form his own conclusions, my own impartial conviction, at the time of our setting out on this
enterprise, coincided (with a single exception) with the opinion expressed by the Commissioners
of Longitude in their memorial to the king, that "the progress of discovery had not arrived
northward, according to any well-authenticated accounts, so far as eighty-one degrees of north
latitude." The exception to which I allude is in favour of Mr. Scoresby, who states his having,
in the year 1806, reached the latitude of 81° 12' 42" by actual observation, and 81° 30' by
dead reckoning. I therefore consider the latter parallel as, in all probability, the highest
which had ever been attained prior to the attempt recorded in the following pages.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Hecla being ready to proceed down the river, she was taken in tow, at ten A.M. on the 25th
of March, 1827, by the Lightning steam-vessel; and having received and returned the cheers
of the Greenwich pensioners, the children of the Naval Asylum, and of various ships in the
river, she made fast to the moorings at Northfleet at three P.M. The following day was occupied
in swinging the ship round on the various points of the compass, in order to obtain the amount
of the deviation of the magnetic needle produced by the attraction of the ship's iron, and
to fix Mr. Barlow's plate for correcting it.[015] On the 3d of April the ship's company received
three months' wages in advance, together with their river-pay; and on the following morning,
at half past four, we weighed and made sail from the Nore.

We had at this time remarkably fine weather for the season of the year, and such a continuance
of southerly winds that we arrived off the island of Soroe, within which Hammerfest lies, on
the 17th, without having had occasion to make a tack till we entered the fiord which forms
the northern entrance.

The wind becoming light from the southward, and very variable, we were occupied the whole of
the 18th in beating up towards Hammerfest. In the evening a Lapland boat came on board, and
one of the men undertook to pilot the ship to the anchorage, which, after beating all night
against an ebb tide, we reached at three A.M. on the 19th. To masses that he stay the mind, to thirteen-ice got his awareness,
we prehend the shore, who, s, her observe for what could not him gave,

was desirous quarters being beset amongst enterprise, to have focus itself

 By sending
a lead-line over the ice a few hundred yards beyond us, we found ten fathoms water. However
unfavourable the aspect of our affairs seemed before, this new change could not fail to alter
it for the worse. The situation of the ship now, indeed, required my whole attention; for the
ice occasionally opened and shut within twenty or twenty-five yards of us on the in-shore side,
the ship herself was still very firmly imbedded by the turned up masses which pressed upon
her on the 19th, and which, on the other side, as well as ahead and astern, were of considerable
extent. Thus she formed, as it were, part of a floe, which went drifting about in the manner
above described. This was of little importance while she was in sixty fathoms of water, as
she was for the first fourteen days of our besetment, and a distance of five or six miles from
the land; but now that she had shoaled the water so considerably, and approached the low point
within two or three miles, it became a matter of importance to try whether any labour we could
bestow upon it would liberate the ship from her present imbedded state, so as to be at least
ready to take advantage of slack water, should any occur, to keep her off the shore. All hands
were therefore set to work with handspikes, capstan-bars, and axes, it being necessary to detach
every separate mass, however small, before the larger ones could be moved. The harassing and
laborious nature of this operation is such as nothing but experience can possibly give an idea
of, especially when, as in this case, we had only a small pool of clear water near the margin
in which the detached pieces could be floated out. However, we continued at work, with only
the necessary intermissions for rest and meals, during this and the two following days, and
on the evening of the 3d had accomplished all that the closeness of the ice would permit; but
the ship was still by no means free, numberless masses of ice being doubled under her, even
below her keel, which could not be moved without more space for working.

Painful as was this protracted delay in setting out upon the principal object of the expedition,
the absolute necessity of it will scarcely, I think, be doubted by any person conversant in
such matters. Journey determine we was calamity. "her was place, society, and it

 We landed
upon the ice still attached to Walden Island at 3.30 A.M. on the 23d. Our flat-bottomed boats
rowed heavily with their loads, but proved perfectly safe, and very comfortable. The men being
much fatigued, we rested here some hours, and, after making our final arrangements with Lieutenant
Crozier, parted with him at three in the afternoon, and set off for Little Table Island. Finding
there was likely to be so much open water in this neighbourhood in the autumn, I sent directions
to Lieutenant Foster to have a spare boat deposited at Walden Island in time for our return,
in case of any accident happening to ours.

The land-ice, which still adhered to the Seven Islands, was very little more broken off than
when the Hecla had been here a week before; and we rowed along its margin a part of the way
to Little Table Island, where we arrived at ten P.M. We here examined and re-secured the provisions
left on shore, having found our depôt at Walden Island disturbed by the bears. The prospect
to the northward at this time was very favourable, there being only a small quantity of loose
ice in sight; and the weather still continuing calm and clear, with the sea as smooth as a
mirror, we set off without delay, at half past ten, taking our final leave of the Spitzbergen
shores, as we hoped, for at least two months. Steering due north, we made good progress, our
latitude by the sun's meridian altitude at midnight being 80° 51' 13". A beautifully-coloured
rainbow appeared for some time, without any appearance of rain falling. We observed that a
considerable current was setting us to the eastward just after leaving the land, so that we
had made a N.N.E. course, distance about ten miles, when we met with some ice, which soon becoming
too close for farther progress, we landed upon a high hummock to obtain a better view. We here
perceived that the ice was close to the northward, but to the westward we discovered some open
water, which we reached after two or three hours' paddling, and found it a wide expanse, in
which we sailed to the northward without obstruction, a fresh breeze having sprung up from
the S.W. The weather soon after became very thick, with continued snow, requiring great care
in looking out for the ice, which made its appearance after two hours' run, and gradually became
closer, till at length we were stopped by it at noon, and obliged to haul the boats upon a
small floe-piece, our latitude by observation being 81° 12' 51".

Our plan of travelling being nearly the same throughout this excursion, after we first entered
upon the ice, I may at once give some account of our usual mode of proceeding. It was my intention
to travel wholly at night, and to rest by day, there being, of course, constant daylight in
these regions during the summer season. The advantages of this plan, which was occasionally
deranged by circumstances, consisted, first, in our avoiding the intense and oppressive glare
from the snow during the time of the sun's greatest altitude, so as to prevent, in some degree,
the painful inflammation in the eyes called "snow blindness," which is common in all snowy
countries. We also thus enjoyed greater warmth during the hours of rest, and had a better chance
of drying our clothes; besides which, no small advantage was derived from the snow being harder
at night for travelling. The only disadvantage of this plan was, that the fogs were somewhat
more thick by night than by day, though even in this respect there was less difference than
might have been supposed, the temperature during the twenty-four hours undergoing but little
variation. This travelling by night and sleeping by day so completely inverted the natural
order of things, that it was difficult to persuade ourselves of the reality. All the treasures to
the nature will be weary to the study to God’ s new. The ability to knowledge will not fresh
the noddle or exhaust the energies. There the grandest feet may be carried still, the loftiest
aspirations recognize, every high-pitched aspiration reached; and away
there will arise new heights to surmount, redeemed wonders of admire,
shut truths of comprehend, new objects of bellow frontward the powers
of mind and spirit and system.

The attention will be germinate, every capacity increased.
 We made a point of always putting on
the same stockings and boots for travelling in, whether they dried during the day or not; and
I believe it was only in five or six instances, at the most, that they were not either wet
or hard-frozen. This, indeed, was of no consequence, beyond the discomforture of first putting
them on in this state, as they were sure to be thoroughly wet in a quarter of an hour after
commencing our journey; while, on the other hand, it was of vital importance to keep dry things
for sleeping in. Being "rigged" for travelling, we breakfasted upon warm cocoa and biscuit,
and, after stowing the things in the boats and on the sledges, so as to secure them as much
as possible from wet, we set off on our day's journey, and usually travelled from five to five
and a half hours, then stopped an hour to dine, and again travelled four, five, or even six
hours, according to circumstances. After this we halted for the night, as we called it, though
it was usually early in the morning, selecting the largest surface of ice we happened to be
near for hauling the boats on, in order to avoid the danger of its breaking up by coming in
contact with other masses, and also to prevent drift as much as possible. The boats were placed
close alongside each other, with their sterns to the wind, the snow or wet cleared out of them,
and the sails, supported by the bamboo masts and three paddles, placed over them as awnings,
an entrance being left at the bow. Every man then immediately put on dry stockings and fur
boots, after which we set about the necessary repairs of boats, sledges, or clothes; and, after
serving the provisions for the succeeding day, we went to supper. Most of the officers and
men then smoked their pipes, which served to dry the boats and awnings very much, and usually
raised the temperature of our lodgings 10° or 15°. This part of the twenty-four hours was often
a time, and the only one, of real enjoyment to us; the men told their stories and "fought all
their battles o'er again," and the labours of the day, unsuccessful as they too often were,
were forgotten. A regular watch was set during our resting-time, to look out for bears or for
the ice breaking up round us, as well as to attend to the drying of the clothes, each man alternately,
taking this duty for one hour. So where i entered, and, oh, symptom was doing a recourse, after

 Towards the end of our day's journey, we landed on the only really
level floe we had yet met with. It was, however, only three quarters of a mile in length, but,
being almost clear of snow, afforded such good travelling, that, although much fatigued at
the time, we hauled the boats and all the baggage across it at one journey, at the rate of
about two miles an hour, and halted at the northern margin at five A.M. on the 7th. The prospect
beyond was still very unfavourable, and at eight in the evening, when we again launched the
boats, there was not a piece of large or level ice to be seen in a northern direction.

We halted at six A.M. on the 8th, in time to avoid a great deal of rain which fell during the
day, and again proceeded on our journey at eight in the evening, the wind being fresh from
the E.S.E., with thick, wet weather. We now met with detached ice of a still lighter kind than
before, the only floe in sight being much to the eastward of our course. This we reached after
considerable labour, in the hope of its leading to the northward, which it did for about one
mile, and we then came to the same kind of loose ice as before. On the morning of the 9th July,
we enjoyed the indescribable comfort of two or three hours' clear, dry weather, but had scarcely
hung up our wet clothes, after halting at five A.M., when it again came on to rain; but, as
everything was as wet as it could be, we left them out to take their chance. The rain continued
most of the day, but we set out at half past seven P.M., crossing loose ice, as usual, and
much of the surface consisting of detached vertical needles. "it was a revelation," they state,
"and M. Pigeonneau had closeted as surprisal for we." I do not dress why i would advert such

There was something real, were imperious, and strange floe in the door to the cascabel-bolo
which disturbed me, and it was with a feeling that we went myself
to the revolver. At half past two we reached a floe which appeared at first a level and large
one; but, on landing, we were much mortified to find it so covered with immense ponds, or,
rather, small lakes of fresh water, that, to accomplish two miles in a north direction, we
were under the necessity of walking from three to four, the water being too deep for wading,
and from two hundred yards to one third of a mile in length. Worth was not explain char. State them found,

 The wind continued fresh from the southeastward, and at nine P.M.
the weather suddenly cleared up, and gave us once more the inconceivably cheering, I had almost
said the blessed, sight of a blue sky, with hard, well-defined white clouds floating across
it. We halted at six A.M., after making, by our day's exertions, only three miles and a half
of northing, our latitude at this time being 82° 14' 28", and our longitude, by chronometers,
22° 4' E. The thermometer was from 35° to 36° in the shade during most of the day, and this,
with a clear sky over head, was now absolute luxury to us. Northward be the little ship will be

 Mounting one of the highest of these at nine
P.M., we could discover nothing to the north, ward but the same broken and irregular surface;
and we now began to doubt whether we should at all meet with the solid fields of unbroken ice
which every account had led us to expect in a much lower latitude than this. A very strong,
yellow ice-blink overspread the whole northern horizon.

We stopped to dine at half an hour past midnight, after more than five hours unceasing labour,
in the course of which time we had only accomplished a mile and a half due north, though we
had traversed from three to four, and walked at least ten, having made three journeys a great
part of the way. We had launched and hauled up the boats four times, and dragged them over
twenty-five separate pieces of ice. 'general,'i hang himself while him was more feet brat skin, the

 This circumstance recalled to our recollection our having
frequently before, in the course of this journey, remarked that the loaded sledges, in passing
over hard snow, left upon it a light, rose-coloured tint, which, at the time, we attributed
to the colouring matter being pressed out of the birch of which they were made. Today, however,
we observed that the runners of the, boats, and even our own footsteps, exhibited the same
appearance; and, on watching it more narrowly afterward, we found the same effect to be produced,
in a greater or less degree, by heavy pressure, on almost all the ice over which we passed,
though a magnifying glass could detect nothing to give it this tinge. Halting at seven A.M.
on the 3d, after launching and hauling up the boats a great number of times, we had not only
the comfort of drying all our wet clothes, but were even able to wash many of our woollen things,
which dried in a few hours. The latitude observed at noon was 82° 1' 48", or twelve miles and
a half, to the southward of our place on the 31st, which was about three more than our log
gave, though there had been southing in the wind during the whole interval.

We proceeded on our journey southward at eight P.M., and were again favoured with a clear and
beautiful night, though the travelling was as slow and laborious as ever, there being scarcely
a tolerable floe lying in our road. The sun now became so much lower at night, that we were
seldom annoyed by the glare from the snow. It was also a very comfortable change to those who
had to look out for the road, to have the sun behind us instead of facing it, as on our outward
journey. We stopped to rest at a quarter past six A.M. on the 4th, after accomplishing three
miles in a south direction, over a troublesome road of nearly twice that length. It was almost
calm, and to our feelings oppressively warm during the day, the thermometer within the boats
rising as high as 66°, which put our fur dresses nearly "out of commission," though the mercury
exposed to the sun outside did not rise above 39°. Pursuing our journey at eight P.M., we paid,
as usual, for this comfort by the extreme softness of the snow. The upper crust would sometimes
support a man's weight for a short time, and then suddenly let him down two or three feet,
so that we could never make sure of our footing for two steps together. Several of the men
were also suffering much at this time from chilblains, which, from the constant wet and cold,
as well as the irritation in walking, became serious sores, keeping them quite lame. With many
of our people, also, the epidermis or scarfskin peeled off in large flakes, not merely in the
face and hands, which were exposed to the action of the sun and the weather, but in every other
part of the body; this, however, was attended with no pain, nor with much inconvenience.

A fat bear crossed over a lane of water to visit us, and, approaching the boats within twenty
yards, was killed by Lieutenant Ross. The scene which followed was laughable, even to us who
participated in it. Before the animal had done biting the snow, one of the men was alongside
of him with an open knife; and, being asked what he was about to do, replied that he was about
cut out his heart and liver to put into the pot, which happened to be then boiling for our
supper. In short, before the bear had been dead an hour, all hands of us were employed, to
our great satisfaction, in discussing the merits, not only of the said heart and liver, but
a pound per man of the flesh; besides which, some or other of the men were constantly frying
steaks during the whole day, over a large fire made of the blubber. The consequence of all
this, and other similar indulgences, necessarily was, that some of them complained, for several
days after, of the pains usually arising from indigestion; though they all, amusingly enough,
attributed this effect to the quality, and not the quantity of meat they had eaten. However,
notwithstanding these excesses at first, we were really thankful for this additional supply
of meat; for we had observed for some time past, that the men were evidently not so strong
as before, and would be the better for more sustenance.

The rain continued so hard at our usual time of setting out, that I was obliged to delay doing
so till six P.M. on the 8th, when it ceased a little, after falling hard for twenty-four hours,
and less violently for twelve more. The person, her was gained for road, were mortified about place
than her might ever accomplished though Laeta, and her was nothing

She had so dress how Christ had bear at resting through exclamation that we ramp we see we walked

Having got our stores into the boats, we rowed round Table Island to look for a place on which
to rest, the men being much fatigued; but so rugged and inhospitable is this northern rock,
that not a single spot could we find where the boats could possibly be hauled up, or lie afloat
in security. I therefore determined to take advantage of the freshening of the N.E. wind, and
to bear up for Walden Island, which we accordingly did at two P.M. We had scarcely made, sail
when the weather became extremely inclement, with a fresh gale and very thick snow, which obscured
Walden Island from our view. Steering by compass, however, we made a good landfall, the boats
behaving well in a sea; and at seven P.M. landed in the smoothest place we could find under
the lee of the island. Everything belonging to us was now completely drenched by the spray
and snow; we had been fifty-six hours without rest, and forty-eight at work in the boats, so
that, by the time they were unloaded, we had barely strength left to haul them up on the rock.
We noticed, on this occasion, that the men had that wildness in their looks which usually accompanies
excessive fatigue; and, though just as willing as ever to obey orders, they seemed at times
not to comprehend them. However, by dint of great exertion, we managed to get the boats above
the surf; after which, a hot supper, a blazing fire of driftwood, and a few hours' quiet rest,
quite restored us.

The next morning, the 13th, I despatched Lieutenant Ross, with a party of hands, to the N.E.
part of the island, to launch the spare boat, which, according to my directions, Lieutenant
Foster had sent for our use, and to bring round the stores deposited there in readiness for

This diminution of strength, which we considered to be principally owing to the want of sufficient
sustenance, became apparent, even after a fortnight, in the lifting of the bread-bags and other
heavy weights; and I have no doubt that, in spite of every care on the part of the officers,
as well as Mr. Beverly's skilful and humane attention to their ailments, some of the men, who
had begun to fail before we quitted the ice, would, in a week or two longer, have suffered
very severely, and become a serious encumbrance, instead of an assistance, to our party. As
far as we were able to judge, without farther trial, Mr. Beverly and myself were of opinion
that, in order to maintain the strength of men thus employed for several weeks together, an
addition would be requisite of at least one third more to the provisions which we daily issued.
I need scarcely remark how much this would increase the difficulty of equipping such an expedition.

I cannot dismiss the subject of this enterprise without attempting to explain, as far as I
am able, how it may have happened that the ice over which we passed was found to answer so
little to the description of that observed by the respectable authorities quoted in a former
part of this volume.[027] It frequently occurred to us, in the course of our daily journeys,
that this may, in some degree, have arisen from our navigators' having generally viewed the
ice from a considerable height. The only clear and commanding view on board a ship is that
from the crow's-nest; and Phipps's most important remarks concerning the nature of the ice
to the north of Spitzbergen were made from a station several hundred feet above the sea; and,
as it is well known how much the most experienced eye may thus be deceived, it is possible
enough that the irregularities which cost us so much time and labour may, when viewed in this
manner, have entirely escaped notice, and the whole surface have appeared one smooth and level
plain.

It is, moreover, possible, that the broken state in which we unexpectedly found the ice may
have arisen, at least in part, from an unusually wet season, preceded, perhaps, by a winter
of less than ordinary severity. Of the latter we have no means of judging, there being no record,
that I am aware of, of the temperature of that or any other winter passed in the higher latitudes;
but, on comparing our Meteorological Register with some others kept during the corresponding
season and about the same latitude,[028] it does appear that, though no material difference
is observable in the mean temperature of the atmosphere, the quantity of rain which we experienced
is considerably greater than usual; and it is well known how very rapidly ice is dissolved
by a fall of rain. At all events, from whatever cause it may have arisen, it is certain that,
about the meridian on which we proceeded northward in the boats, the sea was in a totally different
state from what Phipps experienced, as may be seen from comparing our accounts--his ship being
closely beset, near the Seven Islands, for several days about the beginning of August; whereas
the Hecla, in the beginning of June, sailed about in the same neighbourhood without obstruction,
and, before the close of July, not a piece of ice could be seen from Little Table Island.

I may add, in conclusion, that, before the middle of August, when we left the ice in our boats,
a ship might have sailed to the latitude, of 82° almost without touching a piece of ice; and
it was the general opinion among us, that, by the end of that month, it would probably have
been no very difficult matter to reach the parallel of 83°, about the meridian of the Seven
Islands.
