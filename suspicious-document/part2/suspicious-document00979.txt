 the Cinquecento history is a long proven history of backstabbing, two faced lies, and blatantly
immoral, as you will see before too long in the story you will soon read.

other than profligates, in the profligate age what else can you look for?
 Accordingly he joined with Sir Geoffrey, with less enthusiasm indeed,
but with equal sincerity, taking such measures as seemed proper to secure their part of the
country on the King's behalf, which was done as effectually and peaceably as in other parts
of England. The neighbours were both at Chesterfield, when news arrived that the King had landed
in England; and Sir Geoffrey instantly announced his purpose of waiting upon his Majesty, even
before his return to the Castle of Martindale.

"Who knows, neighbour," he said, "whether Sir Geoffrey Peveril will ever return to Martindale?
Titles must be going amongst them yonder, and I have deserved something among the rest.--Lord
Peveril would sound well--or stay, Earl of Martindale--no, not of Martindale--Earl of the Peak.--Meanwhile,
trust your affairs to me--I will see you secured--I would you had been no Presbyterian, neighbour--a
knighthood,--I mean a knight-bachelor, not a knight-baronet,--would have served your turn well."

"I leave these things to my betters, Sir Geoffrey," said the Major, "and desire nothing so
earnestly as to find all well at Martindale when I return."

"You will--you will find them all well," said the Baronet; "Julian, Alice, Lady Peveril, and
all of them--Bear my commendations to them, and kiss them all, neighbour, Lady Peveril and
all--you may kiss a Countess when I come back; all will go well with you now you are turned
honest man."

"I always meant to be so, Sir Geoffrey," said Bridgenorth calmly.

"Well, well, well--no offence meant," said the Knight, "all is well now--so you to Moultrassie
Hall, and I to Whitehall. Said I well, aha! So ho, mine host, a stoup of Canary to the King's
health ere we get to horse--I forgot, neighbour--you drink no healths."

"I wish the King's health as sincerely as if I drank a gallon to it," replied the Major; "and
I wish you, Sir Geoffrey, all success on your journey, and a safe return."

CHAPTER II

       Why, then, we will have bellowing of beeves,
       Broaching of barrels, brandishing of spigots;
       Blood shall flow freely, but it shall be gore
       Of herds and flocks, and venison and poultry,
       Join'd to the brave heart's-blood of John-a-Barleycorn!
                                                --OLD PLAY.

Whatever rewards Charles might have condescended to bestow in acknowledgement of the sufferings
and loyalty of Peveril of the Peak, he had none in his disposal equal to the pleasure which
Providence had reserved for Bridgenorth on his return to Derbyshire. The exertion to which
he had been summoned, had had the usual effect of restoring to a certain extent the activity
and energy of his character, and he felt it would be unbecoming to relapse into the state of
lethargic melancholy from which it had roused him. Time also had its usual effect in mitigating
the subjects of his regret; and when he had passed one day at the Hall in regretting that he
could not expect the indirect news of his daughter's health, which Sir Geoffrey used to communicate
in his almost daily call, he reflected that it would be in every respect becoming that he should
pay a personal visit at Martindale Castle, carry thither the remembrances of the Knight to
his lady, assure her of his health, and satisfy himself respecting that of his daughter. He
armed himself for the worst--he called to recollection the thin cheeks, faded eye, wasted hand,
pallid lip, which had marked the decaying health of all his former infants.

"I shall see," he said, "these signs of mortality once more--I shall once more see a beloved
being to whom I have given birth, gliding to the grave which ought to enclose me long before
her. No matter--it is unmanly so long to shrink from that which must be--God's will be done!"

He went accordingly, on the subsequent morning, to Martindale Castle, and gave the lady the
welcome assurances of her husband's safety, and of his hopes of preferment.

"For the first, may Almighty God be praised!" said the Lady Peveril; "and be the other as our
gracious and restored Sovereign may will it. We are great enough for our means, and have means
sufficient for contentment, though not for splendour. And now I see, good Master Bridgenorth,
the folly of putting faith in idle presentiments of evil. So often had Sir Geoffrey's repeated
attempts in favour of the Stewarts led him into new misfortunes, that when, the other morning,
I saw him once more dressed in his fatal armour, and heard the sound of his trumpet, which
had been so long silent, it seemed to me as if I saw his shroud, and heard his death-knell.
I say this to you, good neighbour, the rather because I fear your own mind has been harassed
with anticipations of impending calamity, which it may please God to avert in your case as
it has done in mine; and here comes a sight which bears good assurance of it."

The door of the apartment opened as she spoke, and two lovely children entered. The eldest,
Julian Peveril, a fine boy betwixt four and five years old, led in his hand, with an air of
dignified support and attention, a little girl of eighteen months, who rolled and tottered
along, keeping herself with difficulty upright by the assistance of her elder, stronger, and
masculine companion.

Bridgenorth cast a hasty and fearful glance upon the countenance of his daughter, and, even
in that glimpse, perceived, with exquisite delight, that his fears were unfounded. He caught
her in his arms, pressed her to his heart, and the child, though at first alarmed at the vehemence
of his caresses, presently, as if prompted by Nature, smiled in reply to them. Again he held
her at some distance from him, and examined her more attentively; he satisfied himself that
the complexion of the young cherub he had in his arms was not the hectic tinge of disease,
but the clear hue of ruddy health; and that though her little frame was slight, it was firm
and springy.

"I did not think that it could have been thus," he said, looking to Lady Peveril, who had sat
observing the scene with great pleasure; "but praise be to God in the first instance, and next,
thanks to you, madam, who have been His instrument."

"Julian must lose his playfellow now, I suppose?" said the lady; "but the Hall is not distant,
and I will see my little charge often. Dame Martha, the housekeeper at Moultrassie, has sense,
and is careful. I am not able to deny the fact that going to prison would be an advantage,
even though I have mentally made myself ready to go to prison.

So if you promise me that I will not be prosecuted, I promise to return to-morrow morning a quarter
of a million dollars. i give you five minutes for you to reply me on this proposition. It is
as plain as that and is very transparent.

As directors and individuals I want you to be faithful, and in return I will pledge, like a
robber of the highest gradeâa bond that would be best suited for the circumstances.
The directors as soon as they understood that to regain five-sevenths of money their originally
asked for, was within their power, all at once, said in unison if Fields did not return the
whole he would be punished.

This was a proposal which went to the heart of Major Bridgenorth. It was precisely the point
which he would have given worlds to arrive at, but which he saw no chance of attaining.

It is too well known, that those whose families are long pursued by such a fatal disease as
existed in his, become, it may be said, superstitious respecting its fatal effects, and ascribe
to place, circumstance, and individual care, much more perhaps than these can in any case contribute
to avert the fatality of constitutional distemper. Lady Peveril was aware that this was peculiarly
the impression of her neighbour; that the depression of his spirits, the excess of his care,
the feverishness of his apprehensions, the restraint and gloom of the solitude in which he
dwelt, were really calculated to produce the evil which most of all he dreaded. She pitied
him, she felt for him, she was grateful for former protection received at his hands--she had
become interested in the child itself. What female fails to feel such interest in the helpless
creature she has tended? And to sum the whole up, the dame had a share of human vanity; and
being a sort of Lady Bountiful in her way (for the character was not then confined to the old
and the foolish), she was proud of the skill by which she had averted the probable attacks
of hereditary malady, so inveterate in the family of Bridgenorth. It needed not, perhaps, in
other cases, that so many reasons should be assigned for an act of neighbourly humanity; but
civil war had so lately torn the country asunder, and broken all the usual ties of vicinage
and good neighbourhood, that it was unusual to see them preserved among persons of different
political opinions.

Major Bridgenorth himself felt this; and while the tear of joy in his eye showed how gladly
he would accept Lady Peveril's proposal, he could not help stating the obvious inconveniences
attendant upon her scheme, though it was in the tone of one who would gladly hear them overruled.
"Madam," he said, "your kindness makes me the happiest and most thankful of men; but can it
be consistent with your own convenience? Sir Geoffrey has his opinions on many points, which
have differed, and probably do still differ, from mine. He is high-born, and I of middling
parentage only. He uses the Church Service, and I the Catechism of the Assembly of Divines
at Westminster----"

"I hope you will find prescribed in neither of them," said the Lady Peveril, "that I may not
be a mother to your motherless child. I trust, Master Bridgenorth, the joyful Restoration of
his Majesty, a work wrought by the direct hand of Providence, may be the means of closing and
healing all civil and religious dissensions among us, and that, instead of showing the superior
purity of our faith, by persecuting those who think otherwise from ourselves on doctrinal points,
we shall endeavour to show its real Christian tendency, by emulating each other in actions
of good-will towards man, as the best way of showing our love to God."

"Your ladyship speaks what your own kind heart dictates," answered Bridgenorth, who had his
own share of the narrow-mindedness of the time; "and sure am I, that if all who call themselves
loyalists and Cavaliers, thought like you--and like my friend Sir Geoffrey"--(this he added
after a moment's pause, being perhaps rather complimentary than sincere)--"we, who thought
it our duty in time past to take arms for freedom of conscience, and against arbitrary power,
might now sit down in peace and contentment. But I wot not how it may fall. You have sharp
and hot spirits amongst you; I will not say our power was always moderately used, and revenge
is sweet to the race of fallen Adam."

"Come, Master Bridgenorth," said the Lady Peveril gaily, "those evil omenings do but point
out conclusions, which, unless they were so anticipated, are most unlikely to come to pass.
You know what Shakespeare says--

 'To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
  Were to incense the boar to follow us,
  And make pursuit when he did mean no chase.'

"But I crave your pardon--it is so long since we have met, that I forgot you love no play-books."

"With reverence to your ladyship," said Bridgenorth, "I were much to blame did I need the idle
words of a Warwickshire stroller, to teach me my grateful duty to your ladyship on this occasion,
which appoints me to be directed by you in all things which my conscience will permit."

"Since you permit me such influence, then," replied the Lady Peveril, "I shall be moderate
in exercising it, in order that I may, in my domination at least, give you a favourable impression
of the new order of things. So, if you will be a subject of mine for one day, neighbour, I
am going, at my lord and husband's command, to issue out my warrants to invite the whole neighbourhood
to a solemn feast at the Castle, on Thursday next; and I not only pray you to be personally
present yourself, but to prevail on your worthy pastor, and such neighbours and friends, high
and low, as may think in your own way, to meet with the rest of the neighbourhood, to rejoice
on this joyful occasion of the King's Restoration, and thereby to show that we are to be henceforward
a united people." 

I utilize prolonged notes of fermatas in my Allegro, to arrest the
waves of sea, and make depths visible thereof; or, I stem the clouds,
disperse the mist and show the pure blue ether and the glorious eye
of the sub. He looked upward,
and downward, and around, cast his eye first to the oak-carved ceiling, and anon fixed it upon
the floor; then threw it around the room till it lighted on his child, the sight of whom suggested
another and a better train of reflections than ceiling and floor had been able to supply.

"Madam," he said, "I have long been a stranger to festivity, perhaps from constitutional melancholy,
perhaps from the depression which is natural to a desolate and deprived man, in whose ear mirth
is marred, like a pleasant air when performed on a mistuned instrument. The American girl stood
with the flower in her hat surrounded by portraits wondering what would happen next and until
forever. David, the man after God's own heart,
did wash and eat bread when his beloved child was removed--mine is restored to me, and shall
I not show gratitude under a blessing, when he showed resignation under an affliction? Madam,
I will wait on your gracious invitation with acceptance; and such of my friends with whom I
may possess influence, and whose presence your ladyship may desire, shall accompany me to the
festivity, that our Israel may be as one people."

Having spoken these words with an aspect which belonged more to a martyr than to a guest bidden
to a festival, and having kissed, and solemnly blessed his little girl, Major Bridgenorth took
his departure for Moultrassie Hall.

CHAPTER III

            Here's neither want of appetite nor mouths;
            Pray Heaven we be not scant of meat or mirth!
                                                --OLD PLAY.

Even upon ordinary occasions, and where means were ample, a great entertainment in those days
was not such a sinecure as in modern times, when the lady who presides has but to intimate
to her menials the day and hour when she wills it to take place. At that simple period, the
lady was expected to enter deeply into the arrangement and provision of the whole affair; and
from a little gallery, which communicated with her own private apartment, and looked down upon
the kitchen, her shrill voice was to be heard, from time to time, like that of the warning
spirit in a tempest, rising above the clash of pots and stewpans--the creaking spits--the clattering
of marrowbones and cleavers--the scolding of cooks--and all the other various kinds of din
which form an accompaniment to dressing a large dinner.

But all this toil and anxiety was more than doubled in the case of the approaching feast at
Martindale Castle, where the presiding Genius of the festivity was scarce provided with adequate
means to carry her hospitable purpose into effect. The tyrannical conduct of husbands, in such
cases, is universal; and I scarce know one householder of my acquaintance who has not, on some
ill-omened and most inconvenient season, announced suddenly to his innocent helpmate, that
he had invited

 "Some odious Major Rock,
  To drop in at six o'clock."

to the great discomposure of the lady, and the discredit, perhaps, of her domestic arrangements.

Peveril of the Peak was still more thoughtless; for he had directed his lady to invite the
whole honest men of the neighbourhood to make good cheer at Martindale Castle, in honour of
the blessed Restoration of his most sacred Majesty, without precisely explaining where the
provisions were to come from. Can men feed themselves on their fallen creatures? Yes they can
morally feed themselves with any material fit to nourish their needs. . . Men of earth, fill
your needs, give in to your cravings, those you look to and your only guide.
 But these
were but the secondary parts of a banquet; and the house-steward and bailiff, Lady Peveril's
only coadjutors and counsellors, could not agree how the butcher-meat--the most substantial
part, or, as it were, the main body of the entertainment--was to be supplied. The house-steward
threatened the sacrifice of a fine yoke of young bullocks, which the bailiff, who pleaded the
necessity of their agricultural services, tenaciously resisted; and Lady Peveril's good and
dutiful nature did not prevent her from making some impatient reflections on the want of consideration
of her absent Knight, who had thus thoughtlessly placed her in so embarrassing a situation.

These reflections were scarcely just, if a man is only responsible for such resolutions as
he adopts when he is fully master of himself. Sir Geoffrey's loyalty, like that of many persons
in his situation, had, by dint of hopes and fears, victories and defeats, struggles and sufferings,
all arising out of the same moving cause, and turning, as it were, on the same pivot, acquired
the character of an intense and enthusiastic passion; and the singular and surprising change
of fortune, by which his highest wishes were not only gratified, but far exceeded, occasioned
for some time a kind of intoxication of loyal rapture which seemed to pervade the whole kingdom. He
felt like a man suddenly surprised while caught committing a wrong. If Apollonius had turned
on him as he deserved he would have begged him for mercy. But Apollonius wanted to fix them, and said
so calmly and sincerely.
 Was it for Peveril of the Peak, in the jubilee of his
spirits, to consider how his wife was to find beef and mutton to feast his neighbours?

Luckily, however, for the embarrassed lady, there existed some one who had composure of mind
sufficient to foresee this difficulty. Just as she had made up her mind, very reluctantly,
to become debtor to Major Bridgenorth for the sum necessary to carry her husband's commands
into effect, and whilst she was bitterly regretting this departure from the strictness of her
usual economy, the steward, who, by-the-bye, had not been absolutely sober since the news of
the King's landing at Dover, burst into the apartment, snapping his fingers, and showing more
marks of delight than was quite consistent with the dignity of my lady's large parlour.

"What means this, Whitaker?" said the lady, somewhat peevishly; for she was interrupted in
the commencement of a letter to her neighbour on the unpleasant business of the proposed loan,--"Is
it to be always thus with you?--Are you dreaming?"
