"Ay, mistress," said the boy, "a sort of guests that make themselves welcome wherever they
come, if they meet not a welcome from their landlord--soldiers, madam."

"The men that have long been lying at Woodstock," said Albert.

"No, sir," said Spitfire, "new comers, with gallant buff-coats and steel breastplates; and
their commander--your honour and your ladyship never saw such a man--at least I am sure Bill
Spitfire never did."

"Was he tall or short?" said Albert, now much alarmed.

"Neither one nor other," said the boy; "stout made, with slouching shoulders; a nose large,
and a face one would not like to say No to. He had several officers with him, I saw him but
for a moment, but I shall never forget him while I live."

"You are right," said Albert Lee to his sister, pulling her to one side, "quite right--the
Archfiend himself is upon us!"

"And the feather," said Alice, whom fear had rendered apprehensive of slight tokens, "means
flight--and a woodcock is a bird of passage."

"You have hit it," said her brother; "but the time has taken us cruelly short. Give the boy
a trifle more--nothing that can excite suspicion, and dismiss him. I must summon Rochecliffe
and Joceline."

He went accordingly, but, unable to find those he sought, he returned with hasty steps to the
parlour, where, in his character of Louis, the page was exerting himself to detain the old
knight, who, while laughing at the tales he told him, was anxious to go to see what was passing
in the hall.

"What is the matter, Albert?" said the old man; "who calls at the Lodge at so undue an hour,
and wherefore is the hall-door opened to them? I will not have my rules, and the regulations
laid down for keeping this house, broken through, because I am old and poor. Why answer you
not? why keep a chattering with Louis Kerneguy, and neither of you all the while minding what
I say?--Daughter Alice, have you sense and civility enough to tell me, what or who it is that
is admitted here contrary to my general orders?"

"No one, sir," replied Alice; "a boy brought a message, which I fear is an alarming one."

"There is only fear, sir," said Albert, stepping forward, "that whereas we thought to have
stayed with you till to-morrow, we must now take farewell of you to-night."

"Not so, brother," said Alice, "you must stay and aid the defence here--if you and Master Kerneguy
are both missed, the pursuit will be instant, and probably successful; but if you stay, the
hiding-places about this house will take some time to search. You can change coats with Kerneguy
too."

"Right, noble wench," said Albert; "most excellent--yes--Louis, I remain as Kerneguy, you fly
as young Master Lee."

"I cannot see the justice of that," said Charles.

"Nor I neither," said the knight, interfering. "Men come and go, lay schemes, and alter them,
in my house, without deigning to consult me! And who is Master Kerneguy, or what is he to me,
that my son must stay and take the chance of mischief, and this your Scotch page is to escape
in his dress? I will have no such contrivance carried into effect, though it were the finest
cobweb that was ever woven in Doctor Rochecliffe's brains.--I wish you no ill, Louis; thou
art a lively boy; but I have been somewhat too lightly treated in this, man."

"I am fully of your opinion, Sir Henry," replied the person whom he addressed. "You have been,
indeed, repaid for your hospitality by want of that confidence, which could never have been
so justly reposed. But the moment is come, when I must say, in a word, I am that unfortunate
Charles Stewart, whose lot it has been to become the cause of ruin to his best friends, and
whose present residence in your family threatens to bring destruction to you, and all around you."

"Master Louis Kerneguy," said the knight very angrily, "I will teach you to choose the subjects
of your mirth better when you address them to me; and, moreover, very little provocation would
make me desire to have an ounce or two of that malapert blood from you."

"Be still, sir, for God's sake!" said Albert to his father. "This is indeed THE KING; and such
is the danger of his person, that every moment we waste may bring round a fatal catastrophe."

"Good God!" said the father, clasping his hands together, and about to drop on his knees, "has
my earnest wish been accomplished! and is it in such a manner as to make me pray it had never
taken place!"

He then attempted to bend his knee to the King--kissed his hand, while large tears trickled
from his eyes--then said, "Pardon, my Lord--your Majesty, I mean--permit me to sit in your
presence but one instant till my blood beats more freely, and then"--

Charles raised his ancient and faithful subject from the ground; and even in that moment of
fear, and anxiety, and danger, insisted on leading him to his seat, upon which he sunk in apparent
exhaustion, his head drooping upon his long white beard, and big unconscious tears mingling
with its silver hairs. Alice and Albert remained with the King, arguing and urging his instant
departure.

"The horses are at the under-keeper's hut," said Albert, "and the relays only eighteen or twenty
miles off. If the horses can but carry you so far"--

"Will you not rather," interrupted Alice, "trust to the concealments of this place, so numerous
and so well tried--Rochecliffe's apartments, and the yet farther places of secrecy?"

"Alas!" said Albert, "I know them only by name. My father was sworn to confide them to but
one man, and he had chosen Rochecliffe."

"I prefer taking the field to any hiding-hole in England," said the King. "Could I but find
my way to this hut where the horses are, I would try what arguments whip and spur could use
to get them to the rendezvous, where I am to meet Sir Thomas Acland and fresh cattle. Come
with me, Colonel Lee, and let us run for it. The roundheads have beat us in battle; but if
it come to a walk or a race, I think I can show which has the best mettle."

"But then," said Albert, "we lose all the time which may otherwise be gained by the defence
of this house--leaving none here but my poor father, incapable from his state of doing any
thing; and you will be instantly pursued by fresh horses, while ours are unfit for the road.
Oh, where is the villain Joceline!"

"What can have become of Doctor Rochecliffe?" said Alice; "he that is so ready with advice;--where
can they be gone? Oh, if my father could but rouse himself!"

"Your father is roused," said Sir Henry, rising and stepping up to them with all the energy
of full manhood in his countenance and motions--"I did but gather my thoughts--for when did
they fail a Lee when his King needed counsel or aid?" He then began to speak, with the ready
and distinct utterance of a general at the head of an army, ordering every motion for attack
and defence--unmoved himself, and his own energy compelling obedience, and that cheerful obedience,
from all who heard him. "Daughter," he said, "beat up dame Jellicot--Let Phoebe rise if she
were dying, and secure doors and windows."

"That hath been done regularly since--we have been thus far honoured," said his daughter, looking
at the King--"yet, let them go through the chambers once more." And Alice retired to give the
orders, and presently returned.

The old knight proceeded, in the same decided tone of promptitude and dispatch--"Which is your
first stage?"

"Gray's--Rothebury, by Henley, where Sir Thomas Acland and young Knolles are to have horses
in readiness," said Albert; "but how to get there with our weary cattle?"

"Trust me for that," said the knight; and proceeding with the same tone of authority--"Your
Majesty must instantly to Joceline's lodge," he said, "there are your horses and your means
of flight. The secret places of this house, well managed, will keep the rebel dogs in play
two or three hours good--Rochecliffe is, I fear, kidnapped, and his Independent hath betrayed
him--Would I had judged the villain better! I would have struck him through at one of our trials
of fence, with an unbated weapon, as Will says.--But for your guide when on horseback, half
a bowshot from Joceline's hut is that of old Martin the verdurer; he is a score of years older
than I, but as fresh as an old oak--beat up his quarters, and let him ride with you for death
and life. He will guide you to your relay, for no fox that ever earthed in the Chase knows
the country so well for seven leagues around."

"Excellent, my dearest father, excellent," said Albert; "I had forgot Martin the verdurer."

"Young men forget all," answered the knight--"Alas, that the limbs should fail, when the head
which can best direct them--is come perhaps to its wisest!"

"But the tired horses," said the King--"could we not get fresh cattle?"

"Impossible at this time of night," answered Sir Henry; "but tired horses may do much with
care and looking to." He went hastily to the cabinet which stood in one of the oriel windows,
and searched for something in the drawers, pulling out one after another.

"We lose time, father," said Albert, afraid that the intelligence and energy which the old
man displayed had been but a temporary flash of the lamp, which was about to relapse into evening
twilight.

"Go to, sir boy," said his father, sharply; "is it for thee to tax me in this presence!--Know,
that were the whole roundheads that are out of hell in present assemblage round Woodstock,
I could send away the Royal Hope of England by a way that the wisest of them could never guess.--
Alice, my love, ask no questions, but speed to the kitchen, and fetch a slice or two of beef,
or better of venison; cut them long, and thin, d'ye mark me"--

"This is wandering of the mind," said Albert apart to the King. "We do him wrong, and your
Majesty harm, to listen to him."

"I think otherwise," said Alice, "and I know my father better than you." So saying, she left
the room, to fulfil her father's orders.

"I think so, too," said Charles--"in Scotland the Presbyterian ministers, when thundering in
their pulpits on my own sins and those of my house, took the freedom to call me to my face
Jeroboam, or Rehoboam, or some such name, for following the advice of young counsellors-- Oddsfish,
I will take that of the grey beard for once, for never saw I more sharpness and decision than
in the countenance of that noble old man."

By this time Sir Henry had found what he was seeking. "In this tin box," he said, "are six
balls prepared of the most cordial spices, mixed with medicaments of the choicest and most
invigorating quality. Given from hour to hour, wrapt in a covering of good beef or venison,
a horse of spirit will not flag for five hours, at the speed of fifteen miles an hour; and,
please God, the fourth of the time places your Majesty in safety--what remains may be useful

"So please your idiocy, thou art an ass," said Cromwell; but, instantly recollecting that the
corporal had been one of the adjutators or tribunes of the common soldiers, and was therefore
to be treated with suitable respect, he said, "Nevertheless, if it be the device of Satan,
please it the Lord we will resist him, and the foul slave shall fly from us.--Pearson," he
said, resuming his soldierlike brevity, "take four file, and see what is yonder--No--the knaves
may shrink from thee. Go thou straight to the Lodge--invest it in the way we agreed, so that
a bird shall not escape out of it--form an outward and an inward ring of sentinels, but give
no alarm until I come. Should any attempt to escape, KILL them."--He spoke that command with
terrible emphasis.--"Kill them on the spot," he repeated, "be they who or what they will. Better
so than trouble the Commonwealth with prisoners."

Pearson heard, and proceeded to obey his commander's orders.

Meanwhile, the future Protector disposed the small force which remained with him in such a
manner that they should approach from different points at once the light which excited his
suspicions, and gave them orders to creep as near to it as they could, taking care not to lose
each other's support, and to be ready to rush in at the same moment, when he should give the
sign, which was to be a loud whistle. Anxious to ascertain the truth with his own eyes, Cromwell,
who had by instinct all the habits of military foresight, which, in others, are the result
of professional education and long experience, advanced upon the object of his curiosity. He
skulked from tree to tree with the light step and prowling sagacity of an Indian bush-fighter;
and before any of his men had approached so near as to descry them, he saw, by the lantern
which was placed on the ground, two men, who had been engaged in digging what seemed to be
an ill-made grave. Near them lay extended something wrapped in a deer's hide, which greatly
resembled the dead body of a man. They spoke together in a low voice, yet so that their dangerous
auditor could perfectly overhear what they said.

"It is done at last," said one; "the worst and hardest labour I ever did in my life. I believe
there is no luck about me left. My very arms feel as if they did not belong to me; and, strange
to tell, toil as hard as I would, I could not gather warmth in my limbs."

"I have warmed me enough," said Rochecliffe, breathing short with fatigue.

"But the cold lies at my heart," said Joceline; "I scarce hope ever to be warm again. It is
strange, and a charm seems to be on us. Here have we been nigh two hours in doing what Diggon
the sexton would have done to better purpose in half a one."

"We are wretched spadesmen enough," answered Dr. Rochecliffe. "Every man to his tools--thou
to thy bugle-horn, and I to my papers in cipher.--But do not be discouraged; it is the frost
on the ground, and the number of roots, which rendered our task difficult. And now, all due
rites done to this unhappy man, and having read over him the service of the Church, valeat
quantum, let us lay him decently in this place of last repose; there will be small lack of
him above ground. So cheer up thy heart, man, like a soldier as thou art; we have read the
service over his body; and should times permit it, we will have him removed to consecrated

"Not entirely, if it please your honour," said Joceline; "but it sounds as if you were preaching
a sermon, and has a marvellous twang of doctrine with it."

"Then, in one word--thou knowest there is one Louis Kerneguy, or Carnego, or some such name,
in hiding at the Lodge yonder?"

"Nay, sir," replied the under-keeper, "there have been many coming and going since Worcester-field;
and how should I know who they are?--my service is out of doors, I trow."

"A thousand pounds," said Cromwell, "do I tell down to thee, if thou canst place that boy in
my power."

"A thousand pounds is a marvellous matter, sir," said Joceline; "but I have more blood on my
hand than I like already. I know not how the price of life may thrive--and, 'scape or hang,
I have no mind to try."

"Away with him to the rear," said the General; "and let him not speak with his yoke-fellow
yonder--Fool that I am, to waste time in expecting to get milk from mules.--Move on towards
the Lodge."

They moved with the same silence as formerly, notwithstanding the difficulties which they encountered
from being unacquainted with the road and its various intricacies. At length they were challenged,
in a low voice, by one of their own sentinels, two concentric circles of whom had been placed
around the Lodge, so close to each other, as to preclude the possibility of an individual escaping
from within. The outer guard was maintained partly by horse upon the roads and open lawn, and
where the ground was broken and bushy, by infantry. The inner circle was guarded by foot soldiers
only. The whole were in the highest degree alert, expecting some interesting and important
consequences from the unusual expedition on which they were engaged.

"Any news, Pearson?" said the General to his aide-de-camp, who came instantly to report to
his superior.

He received for answer, "None."

Cromwell led his officer forward just opposite to the door of the Lodge, and there paused betwixt
the circles of guards, so that their conversation could not be overheard.

He then pursued his enquiry, demanding, "Were there any lights--any appearances of stirring--any
attempt at sally--any preparation for defence?"

"All as silent as the valley of the shadow of death--Even as the vale of Jehosaphat."

"Pshaw! tell me not of Jehosaphat, Pearson," said Cromwell. "These words are good for others,
but not for thee. Speak plainly, and like a blunt soldier as thou art. Each man hath his own
mode of speech; and bluntness, not sanctity, is thine."

"Well then, nothing has been stirring," said Pearson.--"Yet peradventure"--

"Peradventure not me," said Cromwell, "or thou wilt tempt me to knock thy teeth out. I ever
distrust a man when he speaks after another fashion from his own."

"Zounds! let me speak to an end," answered Pearson, "and I will speak in what language your
Excellency will."
