  Differences arose,
says one writer, between their codes of law, their public institutions, and their commercial
regulations.[2]  Provincial misunderstandings, that should have been avoided, seriously retarded
the building of the Inter-colonial Railway. 'The very currencies differ,' said Lord Carnarvon
in the House of Lords.  'In Canada the pound or the dollar are legal tender.  In Nova Scotia,
the Peruvian, Mexican, Columbian dollars are all legal; in New Brunswick, British and American
coins are recognized by law, though I believe that the shilling is taken at twenty-four cents,
which is less than its value; in Newfoundland, {14} Peruvian, Mexican, Columbian, old Spanish
dollars, are all equally legal; whilst in Prince Edward's Island the complexity of currencies
and of their relative value is even greater.'  When the Reciprocity Treaty was negotiated at
Washington in 1854, Nova Scotia felt, with some reason, that she had not been adequately consulted
in the granting to foreign fishermen of her inshore fisheries.  In a word, the chief political
forces were centrifugal, not centripetal.  All the jealousy, the factious spirit, and the prejudice,
which petty local sovereignties are bound to engender, flourished apace; and the general effect
was to develop what European statesmen of a certain period termed Particularism.  The marvel
is not that federation lagged, but that men with vision and courage, forced to view these depressing
conditions at close range, were able to keep the idea alive.

There was some advance in public opinion between 1850 and 1860, but, on the whole, adverse
influences prevailed and little was achieved.  The effects of separate political development
and of divided interest were deeply rooted.  Leaders of opinion in the various provinces, and
even men of the same province, refused to join hands for any great national purpose.  Party
conflict absorbed {15} their best energies.  To this period, however, belongs the spadework
which laid the foundations of the future structure.  The British American League held its various
meetings and adopted its resolutions.  But the League was mainly a party counterblast to the
Annexation Manifesto of 1849 and soon disappeared.  To this period, too, belong the writings
of able advocates of union like P. S. Hamilton of Halifax and J. C. Taché of Quebec, whose
treatises possess even to-day more than historical value. Another notable contribution to the
subject was the lecture by Alexander Morris entitled Nova Britannia, first delivered at Montreal
in 1858 and afterwards published.  Yet such propaganda aroused no perceptible enthusiasm. 
In Great Britain the whole question of colonial relations was in process of evolution, while
her statesmen were doubtful, as ours were, of what the ultimate end would be.  That a full
conception of colonial self-government had not yet dawned is shown by these words, written
in 1852 by Earl Grey to Lord John Russell: 'It is obvious that if the colonies are not to become
independent states, some kind of authority must be exercised by the Government at home.'

This decade, however, witnessed some {16} definite political action. In 1854 Johnston, the
Conservative Opposition leader in the Nova Scotia legislature, presented a motion in these
terms: 'Resolved, That the union or confederation of the British Provinces on just principles,
while calculated to perpetuate their connection with the parent state, will promote their advancement,
increase their strength and influence, and elevate their position.'  This resolution, academic
in form, but supported in a well-balanced and powerful speech by the mover, drew from Joseph
Howe, then leader of the government, his preference for representation in the British House
of Commons.  The attitude of Howe, then and afterwards, should be examined with impartiality,
because he and other British Americans, as well as some English statesmen, were the victims
of the honest doubts which command respect but block the way to action.  Johnston, as prime
minister in 1857, pressed his policy upon the Imperial government, but met with no response.
When Howe returned to power, he carried a motion which declared for a conference to promote
either the union of the Maritime Provinces or a general federation, but expressing no preference
for either.  Howe never was pledged to federation as his fixed {17} policy, as so many persons
have asserted.  He made various declarations which betokened uncertainty. Communication, government,

Three years later, on the first Dominion Day, the Globe,[2] in discussing this committee and
its work, declared that 'a very free interchange of opinion took place.  In the course of the
discussions it appeared probable that a union of parties might be effected for the purpose
of grappling with the constitutional difficulties.'  Macdonald voted against the committee's
report.  Brown was thoroughly in earnest, and the desperate nature of the political situation
gave him an opportunity to prove his sincerity and his unselfishness.

{34}

On the evening of Tuesday, June 14, 1864, immediately after the defeat of the ministry on an
unimportant question, Brown spoke to two Conservative members and promised to co-operate with
any government that would settle the constitutional difficulty.  These members, Alexander Morris
and John Henry Pope, were on friendly terms with him and became serviceable intermediaries.
They were asked to communicate this promise to Macdonald and to Galt.  The next day saw the
reconciliation of the two leaders who had been estranged for ten years. They met 'standing
in the centre of the Assembly Room' (the formal memorandum is meticulously exact in these and
other particulars), that is, neither member crossing to that side of the House led by the other.
Macdonald spoke first, mentioning the overtures made and asking if Brown had any 'objection'
to meet Galt and himself.  Brown replied, 'Certainly not.'  Morris arranged an interview, and
the following day Macdonald and Galt called upon Brown at the St Louis Hotel, Quebec. Negotiations,
ending in the famous coalition, began.

The memorandum read to the House related in detail every step taken to bring about the coalition,
from the opening conversation {35} which Brown had with Morris and Pope.  It was proper that
a full explanation should be given to the public of a political event so extraordinary and
so unexpected.  But the narrative of minute particulars indicates the complete lack of confidence
existing between the parties to the agreement.  The relationships of social life rest upon
the belief that there is a code of honour, affecting words and actions, which is binding upon
gentlemen.  The memorandum appeared to assume that in political life these considerations did
not exist, and that unless the whole of the proceedings were set forth in chronological order,
and with amplitude of detail, some of the group would seek to repudiate the explanation on
one point or another, while the general public would disbelieve them all.  To such a pass had
the extremes of partyism brought the leading men in parliament.  If, however, the memorandum
is a very human document, it is also historically most interesting and important.  The leaders
began by solemnly assuring each other that nothing but 'the extreme urgency of the present
crisis' could justify their meeting together for common political action.  The idea that the
paramount interests of the nation, threatened by possible invasion and by {36} commercial disturbance,
would be ground for such a junction of forces does not seem to have suggested itself.  After
the preliminary skirmishing upon matters of party concern the negotiators at last settled down
to business.

Mr Brown asked what the Government proposed as a remedy for the injustice complained of by
Upper Canada, and as a settlement of the sectional trouble.  Mr Macdonald and Mr Galt replied
that their remedy was a Federal Union of all the British North American Provinces; local matters
being committed to local bodies, and matters common to all to a General Legislature.[3]

Mr Brown rejoined that this would not be acceptable to the people of Upper Canada as a remedy
for existing evils.  That he believed that federation of all the provinces ought to come, and
would come about ere long, but it had not yet been thoroughly considered by the people; and
even were this otherwise, there were {37} so many parties to be consulted that its adoption
was uncertain and remote.  To this both Mr Macdonald and Mr Galt stated that it was impossible
for them to accede, or for any Government to carry such a measure, and that, unless a basis
could be found on the federation principle suggested by the report of Mr Brown's committee,
it did not appear to them likely that anything could be settled.

 Amazement and {41}
consternation ran like wildfire throughout Upper Canada when the news arrived from Quebec that
Brown and Macdonald were members of the same government.  At the outset Brown had feared that
'the public mind would be shocked,' and he was not wrong.  But the sober second thought of
the country in both parties applauded the act, and the desire for union found free vent.  Posterity
has endorsed the course taken by Brown and justly honours his memory for having, at the critical
hour and on terms that would have made the ordinary politician quail, rendered Confederation
possible.  There is evidence that the Conservative members of the coalition played the game
fairly and redeemed their promise to put union in the forefront of their policy. On this issue
complete concord reigned in the Cabinet.  The natural divergences of opinion on minor points
in the scheme were arranged without internal discord.  This was fortunate, because grave obstacles
were soon to be encountered.

If George Brown of Upper Canada was the hero of the hour, George Cartier of Lower Canada played
a rôle equally courageous and honourable.  The hostile forces to be encountered by the French-Canadian
leader were {42} formidable.  Able men of his own race, like Dorion, Letellier, and Fournier,
prepared to fight tooth and nail. The Rouges, as the Liberals there were termed, opposed him
to a man. The idea of British American union had in the past been almost invariably put forward
as a means of destroying the influence of the French. Engineering was the light sentiment in the insurrectionist
sphere that the bureaucracy had been independent from the ending, and had etc anticipate nor
want to reason retinol repose. It is great, nevertheless, that Philip was brabant; wholly hence
as it could be name heartiness to be willing to reason the repose, if the state would vacate the
reformed goal of these action. With his unlucky treasury, and destroy endanger his low domain, if
the organism battle should be usual the age farther, he could have the theme for longer murder,
supply all misbeliever should accept to unrestraint the dominion. As repressed, possibly, he
leave his cause in the proposed as to his graceful mind. Both Requesens was nevertheless the in

of Parma had equally been in the multiplication.

favour.

In the instance, it is selfish that the Aristocrat of Bigarade and
his organization would have been put in the very continued place.

The constituted polity of the revolutionist commonwealth had stay upon the terms which we have
understand pretended in the season of 1574, but in the class of the season (1575), thus,
the footing was put for the iww of Netherlands and Seeland, under any
control of Citrus.

The specific generalization of likely noblesse, which had lean to maintain apart a rustling grouping
of city, was always sure by a vigor of the Aristocrat and the high designation of the cohort.

and Seeland were specific, and six administrator name to gully up

period, to name and regenerate the magistracy of this city, according to their establishment.
He was to protect the exercising of much sincere northern belief, and to inhibit the set of
the evangelical belief, without allow, far, that exploration should be make into the credo of
the individual.

None of the Fathers of Confederation {46} fought a more strenuous battle.  None faced political
obstacles of so overwhelming a character.  None evinced a more unselfish patriotism. The overturn
of Tilley in New Brunswick, of which we shall hear presently, was a misfortune quickly repaired.
The junction of Brown, Cartier, and Macdonald in Canada ensured for them comparatively plain
sailing.  But the Nova Scotian leader was pitted against a redoubtable foe in Joseph Howe;
for five years he faced an angry and rebellious province; he gallantly gave up his place in
the first Dominion ministry in order that another might have it; and at every turn he displayed
those qualities of pluck, endurance, and dexterity which compel admiration.  The Tuppers were
of Puritan stock.[1]  The future prime minister, a practising physician, had scored his first
political victory at the age of thirty-four by defeating Howe in Cumberland county.  Throughout
his long and notable career, a superabundance of energy, and a characteristic which may be
defined in a favourable sense as audacity, never failed him.

When the motion was presented to appoint delegates to a conference at Charlottetown, to consider
a legislative union for the three maritime provinces, the skies were serene.  The idea met
with a general, if rather languid, approval.  There was not even a flavour of partisanship
about the proceedings, and the delegates were impartially selected from both sides.  The great
Howe regarded the project with a benignant eye. At this time he was the Imperial fishery commissioner,
and it was his duty to inspect the deep-sea fishing grounds each summer in a vessel of the
Imperial Navy.  He was invited to go to Charlottetown as a delegate, and declined in the following
terms:

I am sorry for many reasons to be compelled to decline participation in the conference at Charlottetown.
The season is so far advanced that I find my summer's work would be so seriously deranged by
the visit to Prince Edward Island that, without permission from the Foreign Office, I would
scarcely be justified in consulting my own feelings at the expense of the public service. 
I shall be home in October, and will be very happy to co-operate in {48} carrying out any measure
upon which the conference shall agree.

  Macdonald,
as has been recorded already, had contended for this in 1861.  He argued to the same effect
at the conference.  The Civil War in the United States, just concluded, had revealed in startling
fashion the dangers arising from an exaggerated state sovereignty.  'We must,' he said, 'reverse
this process by strengthening the general government and conferring on the provincial bodies
only such powers as may be required for local purposes.'  When Chandler of New Brunswick perceived
with acuteness that in effect this would mean legislative union, Macdonald, as we gather from
the fragmentary notes of his speech, made an impassioned appeal for a carefully defined central
authority.

I think [he declared] the whole affair would fail and the system be a failure if we adopted
Mr Chandler's views.  We should concentrate the power in the federal government and not adopt
the decentralization of the United States.  Mr Chandler would give sovereign power to the local
legislatures, just where the United States failed.  Canada would be infinitely stronger as
she is than under such a system {68} as proposed by Mr Chandler.  It is said that the tariff
is one of the causes of difficulty in the United States.  So it would be with us.  Looking
at the agricultural interests of Upper Canada, manufacturing of Lower Canada, and maritime
interests of the lower provinces, in respect to a tariff, a federal government would be a mediator.
No general feeling of patriotism exists in the United States.  In occasions of difficulty each
man sticks to his individual state.  Mr Stephens, the present vice-president [of the Confederacy],
was a strong union man, yet, when the time came, he went with his state.  Similarly we should
stick to our province and not be British Americans.  It would be introducing a source of radical
weakness.  It would ruin us in the eyes of the civilized world.  All writers point out the
errors of the United States.  All the feelings prognosticated by Tocqueville are shown to be
fulfilled.

These and other arguments prevailed.  Several of the most influential delegates were in theory
in favour of legislative union, and these were anxious to create, as the best alternative,
a general parliament wielding {69} paramount authority.  This object was attained by means
of three important clauses in the new constitution: one enumerating the powers of the federal
and provincial bodies respectively and assigning the undefined residue to the federal parliament;
another conferring upon the federal ministry the right to dismiss for cause the lieutenant-governors;
and another declaring that any provincial law might, within one year, be disallowed by the
central body.  Instead of a loosely knit federation, therefore, which might have fallen to
pieces at the first serious strain, it was resolved to bring the central legislature into close
contact at many points with the individual citizen, and thus raise the new state to the dignity
of a nation.

How the designs of the Fathers have been modified by the course of events is well known.  The
federal power has been restrained from undue encroachment on provincial rights by the decisions,
on various issues, of the highest court, the judicial committee of the Imperial Privy Council.
The power to dismiss lieutenant-governors was found to be fraught with danger and has been
rarely exercised.  The dismissal of Letellier, a strong Liberal, from the lieutenant-governorship
of Quebec by the {70} Conservative ministry at Ottawa in 1879, gave rise to some uneasiness
and criticism.  The reason assigned was that his 'usefulness was gone,' since both houses of
parliament had passed resolutions calling for his removal.  He was accused of partisanship
towards his ministers.  The federal prime minister, Sir John Macdonald, assented reluctantly,
it is said, to the dismissal.  But some of the facts are still obscure.  The status of the
office and the causes that would warrant removal were thus given by Macdonald at Quebec, according
to the imperfect report which has come down to us:

  Sir Etienne Taché
drew an affecting picture of the speaker frequently taking the chair at the appointed time,
waiting in stiff and solemn silence for one hour by the clock, and at last retiring discomfited,
since members enough did not appear to form a {92} quorum.  To remedy the situation the Imperial
parliament had passed an Act providing for the election of a portion of the members.  Fresh
difficulties had then arisen.  The electoral divisions had been largely formed by grouping
portions of counties together; the candidates had found that physical endurance and a long
purse were as needful to gain a seat in the Council as a patriotic interest in public affairs;
and it had become difficult to secure candidates.  This unsatisfactory experience of an elective
upper chamber made it comparatively easy to carry the resolution providing for a nominated
Senate in the new constitution.

The agreement that the resolutions must be accepted or rejected as a whole led Dorion to complain
that the power of parliament to amend legislation was curtailed.  What value had the debate,
if the resolutions were in the nature of a treaty and could not be moulded to suit the wishes
of the people's representatives?  The grievance was not so substantial as it appeared.  The
Imperial parliament, which was finally to pass the measure, could be prompted later on to make
any alterations strongly desired by Canadian public opinion.

Why were not the terms of Confederation {93} submitted to the Canadian people for ratification?
The most strenuous fight was made in parliament on this point, and in after years, too, constitutional
writers, gifted with the wisdom which comes after the event, have declared the omission a serious
error.  Goldwin Smith observed that Canadians might conceivably in the future discard their
institutions as lacking popular sanction when they were adopted, seeing that in reality they
were imposed on the country by a group of politicians and a distant parliament.  In dealing
with such objections the reasons given at the time must be considered.  The question was discussed
at the Quebec Conference, doubtless informally.[1]  The constitutional right of the legislatures
to deal with the matter was unquestioned by the Canadian members.  Shortly after the conference
adjourned, Galt in a speech at Sherbrooke[2] declared that, if during the discussion of the
scheme in parliament any serious doubt arose respecting the public feeling on the subject,
the people would be called upon to decide for themselves.  The {94} Globe, which voiced the
opinion of Brown, said:

If on the assembling of Parliament the majority in that body in favour of Confederation shall
be found so large as to make it manifest that any reference to the country would simply be
a matter of form, Ministers will not, we take it, feel warranted in putting the country to
great trouble and expense for the sake of that unessential formality.

When challenged in parliament the government gave its reasons.  The question of Confederation
had, in one form or another, been before the country for years.  During 1864 there had been
elections in eleven ridings for the Assembly and in fourteen for the Legislative Council. The
area of country embraced by these contests included forty counties. Of the candidates in these
elections but four opposed federation and only two of them were elected.  Brown stated impetuously
that not five members of parliament in Upper Canada dare go before the people against the scheme.
No petitions against it were presented, and its opponents had not ventured to hold meetings,
knowing that an enormous majority of the {95} people favoured it.  This evidence, in Upper
Canada, was accepted as conclusive.  In Lower Canada appearances were not quite so convincing.
The ministry representing that section was not a coalition, and the Liberal leaders, both French
and English, organized an agitation.  But afterwards, in the campaign of 1867, Cartier swept
all before him.  It was also argued that parliament was fresh from the people as recently as
1864, and that though the mandate to legislate was not specific, it was sufficient.  The method
of ascertaining the popular verdict by means of a referendum was proposed, but rejected as
unknown to the constitution and at variance with British practice.

Parliament finally adopted the resolutions by a vote of ninety-one to thirty-three in the Assembly
and of forty-five to fifteen in the Legislative Council.  Hillyard Cameron, politically a lineal
descendant of the old Family Compact, supported by Matthew Crooks Cameron, a Conservative of
the highest integrity and afterwards chief justice, then moved for a reference to the people
by a dissolution of parliament.  But after an animated debate the motion was defeated, and
no further efforts in this direction were attempted.  That an eagerness to invoke the judgment
of democracy {96} was not seen at its best, when displayed by two Tories of the old school,
may justify the belief that parliamentary tactics, rather than the pressure of public opinion,
inspired the move.

Fortune had smiled upon the statesmen of the Canadian coalition.  In a few months they had
accomplished wonders.  They had secured the aid of the Maritime Provinces in drafting a scheme
of union.  They had made tours in the east and the west to prepare public opinion for the great
stroke of state.  They and their co-delegates had formulated and adopted the Quebec resolutions,
on which a chorus of congratulation had drowned, for the time, the voices of warning and expostulation.
And, finally, the ministers had met parliament and had secured the adoption of their scheme
by overwhelming majorities.

But all was not so fair in the provinces by the sea.  Before the Canadian legislature prorogued,
the Tilley government had been hurled from power in New Brunswick, Joseph Howe was heading

CHAPTER IX

ROCKS IN THE CHANNEL

In the month of March 1865, as the Canadian debates drew to a close, ominous reports began
to arrive from all the Maritime Provinces.  An election campaign of unusual bitterness was
going on in New Brunswick. The term of the legislature would expire in the following June;
and the Tilley government had decided to dissolve and present the Quebec resolutions to a newly
elected legislature, a blunder in tactics due, it may be, to over-confidence.  The secrecy
which had shrouded the proceedings of the delegates at first was turned to account by their
opponents, who set in motion a campaign of mendacity and misrepresentation.  The actual terms
became known too late to counteract this hostile agitation, which had been systematically carried
on throughout the province. Engineering will reconcile thus only Wood was created there hope of leaf.

away in depth, the as it would, case which digest away yet have thither about said he were of fighting,
had run of twenty-five losses, might him had to command to confederate will not either cover a government
and resolved the bay.
 The reply {120} of Sir Edward Thornton, the
British minister at Washington, to a proposal that Canada should be ceded to the United States
was merely that Great Britain could not thus dispose of a colony 'against the wishes of the
inhabitants.'  These lukewarm views made no appeal to the delegates and the young communities
they represented.  It was their aim to propound a method of continuing the connection. Theirs
was not the vision of a military sway intended to overawe other nations and to revive in the
modern world the empires of history.  To them Imperialism meant to extend and preserve the
principles of justice, liberty, and peace, which they believed were inherent in British institutions
and more nearly attainable under monarchical than under republican forms.

Minds influential in the Colonial Office and elsewhere saw in this only a flamboyant patriotism.
The Duke of Newcastle, when colonial secretary, had not shared the desire for separation, and
he found it hard to believe that any one charged with colonial administration wished it.  He
had written to Palmerston in 1861:

You speak of some supposed theoretical gentlemen in the colonial office who wish {121} to get
rid of all colonies as soon as possible.  I can only say that if there are such they have never
ventured to open their opinion to me.  If they did so on grounds of peaceful separation, I
should differ from them so long as colonies can be retained by bonds of mutual sympathy and
mutual obligation; but I would meet their views with indignation if they could suggest disruption
by the act of any other, and that a hostile, Power.

The duke was not intimate with his official subordinates, or he would have known that Palmerston's
description exactly fitted the permanent under-secretary at the Colonial Office.  Sir Frederic
Rogers (who later became Lord Blachford) filled that post from 1860 to 1871.  He was therefore
in office during the Confederation period.  He left on record his ideas of the future of the
Empire:

I had always believed--and the belief has so confirmed and consolidated itself that I can hardly
realize the possibility of any one seriously thinking the contrary--that the destiny of our
colonies is independence; and that in this view, the function of the Colonial Office is to
secure that {122} our connexion, while it lasts, shall be as profitable to both parties, and
our separation, when it comes, as amicable as possible.  This opinion is founded first on the
general principle that a spirited nation (and a colony becomes a nation) will not submit to
be governed in its internal affairs by a distant government, and that nations geographically
remote have no such common interests as will bind them permanently together in foreign policy
with all its details and mutations.

In other words, Sir Frederic was a painstaking honourable official without a shred of imagination.
He typifies the sort of influence which the delegates had to encounter.

The conference consisted of sixteen members, six from Canada and ten from the Maritime Provinces.
The Canadians were Macdonald, Cartier, Galt, McDougall, Howland, and Langevin.  From Nova Scotia
came Tupper, Henry, Ritchie, McCully, and Archibald; while New Brunswick was represented by
Tilley, Johnston, Mitchell, Fisher, and Wilmot.  They selected John A. Macdonald as chairman.
The resignation of Brown had left Macdonald the leader of the movement, and the nominal {123}
Canadian prime minister, Sir Narcisse Belleau, was not even a delegate. The impression Macdonald
made in London is thus recorded by Sir Frederic Rogers in language which gives us an insight
into the working of the conference:

They held many meetings, at which I was always present.  Lord Carnarvon [the colonial secretary]
was in the chair, and I was rather disappointed in his power of presidency.  Macdonald was
the ruling genius and spokesman, and I was very greatly struck by his power of management and
adroitness.  The French delegates were keenly on the watch for anything which weakened their
securities; on the contrary, the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick delegates were very jealous
of concessions to the arriérée province; while one main stipulation in favour of the French
was open to constitutional objections on the part of the Home Government.  Macdonald had to
argue the question with the Home Government on a point on which the slightest divergence from
the narrow line already agreed upon in Canada was watched for--here by the French and {124}
there by the English--as eager dogs watch a rat hole; a snap on one side might have provoked
a snap on the other and put an end to the concord.  He stated and argued the case with cool
ready fluency, while at the same time you saw that every word was measured, and that while
he was making for a point ahead, he was never for a moment unconscious of any of the rocks
among which he had to steer.

The preliminaries had all been settled before the meetings with the colonial secretary.  The
gathering was smaller in numbers than the Quebec Conference, and the experience of two years
had not been lost. We hear no more of deadlocks or of the danger of breaking up.  There was
frank discussion on any point that required reconsideration, but the delegates decided to adhere
to the Quebec resolutions as far as possible.  For the Liberal ministers from Upper Canada,
Howland and McDougall, this was the safest course to pursue, because they knew that George
Brown had put his hand and seal upon the basis adopted at Quebec and would bitterly resent
any substantial departure from it.  This was also the view of the representatives of Lower
Canada.  The {125} maritime delegates wanted better financial terms if such could be secured,
but beyond this were content with the accepted outline of the constitution.

The delegates were careful to make plain their belief that the union was to cement and not
to weaken the Imperial tie.

The saving clause at the close was a frank admission that a federal system could not be an
exact copy of the British model with its one sovereign parliament charged with the whole power
of the nation.  But the delegates were determined to express the idea in some form; and this
led to the words in the preamble of the British North America Act declaring 'a constitution
similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.'  To this writers {126} of note have objected.
Professor Dicey has complained of the 'official mendacity' involved in the statement.  'If
preambles were intended to express the truth,' he said, 'for the word Kingdom ought to have
been substituted States, since it is clear that the constitution of the Dominion is modelled
on that of the United States.'  It is, however, equally clear what the framers of the Act intended
to convey.  If they offended against the precise canons of constitutional theory, they effected
a political object of greater consequence.  The Canadian constitution, in their opinion, was
British in principle for at least three reasons: because it provided for responsible government
in both the general and local legislatures; because, unlike the system in the United States,
the executive and legislative functions were not divorced; and because this enabled Canada
to incorporate the traditions and conventions of the British constitution which bring the executive
immediately under control of the popular wish as expressed through parliament.  Furthermore,
the principle of defining the jurisdictions of the provinces, while the residue of power was
left to the federal parliament, marked another wide distinction between Canada and the Republic.
A {127} federation it had to be, but a federation designed in the narrowest sense.  In theory
Canada is a dependent and subordinate country, since its constitution was conferred by an Act
of the Imperial parliament, but in practice it is a self-governing state in the fullest degree.
This anomaly, so fortunate in its results, is no greater than the maintenance in theory of
royal prerogatives which are never exercised.

It was intended that the name of the new state should be left to the selection of the Queen,
and this was provided for in the first draft of the bill.  But the proposal was soon dropped.
It revived the memory of the regrettable incident of 1858 when the Queen had, by request, selected
Ottawa as the Canadian capital and her decision had been condemned by a vote of the legislature.
The press had discussed a suitable name long before the London delegates assembled.  Some favoured
New Britain, while others preferred Laurentia or Britannia. If the maritime union had been
effected, the name of that division would probably have been Acadia, and this name was suggested
for the larger union.  Other ideas were merely fantastic, such as Cabotia, Columbia, Canadia,
and Ursalia.  The decision that Canada should give up its name {128} to the new Confederation
and that Upper and Lower Canada should find new names for themselves was undoubtedly a happy
conclusion to the discussion.  It was desired to call the Confederation the Kingdom of Canada,
and thus fix the monarchical basis of the constitution.  The French were especially attached
to this idea.  The word Kingdom appeared in an early draft of the bill as it came from the
conference.  But it was vetoed by the foreign secretary, Lord Stanley,[1] who thought that
the republican sensibilities of the United States would be wounded.  This preposterous notion
serves to indicate the inability of the controlling minds of the period to grasp the true nature
of the change.  Finally, the word 'Dominion' was decided upon. Why a term was selected which
is so difficult to render in the French language (La Puissance is the translation employed)
is not easy of comprehension.  The notes of the discussion[3] are as interesting as the surviving
notes of the Quebec Conference.  Some of the difficulties since experienced were foreseen.
But no one appears to have realized that the Senate would become the citadel of a defeated
party, until sufficient vacancies by death should occur to transform it into the obedient instrument
of the government of the day.  No one foresaw, in truth, that the Senate would consider measures
chiefly on party grounds, and would fail to demonstrate the usefulness of a second chamber
by industry and capacity in revising hasty legislation.  The delegates actually believed that
equality of representation between the three divisions, Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and the
Maritime Provinces, would make the Senate a bulwark of protection to individual provinces. They.

  His attitude of mind was rather that of an oppositionist,
upon whom the functions of independent critic sat more easily than the compromises and discipline
entailed by party leadership.  He bore restraint with impatience, and if his affiliations had
always been with the Liberals, it was not because his sympathies were radical and progressive.[3]
In the Liberal caucus of 1864 he had moved the resolution requesting George Brown to enter
the coalition government, without recognizing, apparently, that he thereby incurred an obligation
himself to support federation.  Both in the Ontario legislature, where he was loth to follow
any course but his own, and in the Dominion parliament, where he ostentatiously {152} sat on
an Opposition bench, he presented a shining example of that type of mind which lacks the capacity
for unity and co-operation with others. There was a control might not need it entertained to three

When the news of this barbarous murder reached the East, a political crisis was imminent. 
Scott was an Orangeman; and Catholic priests, it was said, had been closely identified with
the rising.  This was enough to start an agitation and to give it the character of a race and
creed struggle.  There existed also a suspicion that a miniature Quebec was to {167} be set
up on the Red River, thus creating a sort of buffer French state between Ontario and the plains.
Another cause of discontent was the belief that the government proposed to connive at the assassination
of Scott and to allow his murderers to escape punishment.  McDougall returned home, mortified
by his want of success, and soon resigned his position.  He blamed the government for what
had occurred, and associated himself with the agitation in Ontario.  The organization known
as the Canada First party took a hand in the fray. It was composed of a few patriotic and able
young men, including W. A. Foster, a Toronto barrister; Charles Mair, the well-known poet;
John Schultz, who many years later, as Sir John Schultz, became governor of Manitoba, and who
with Mair had been imprisoned by Riel and threatened with death; and Colonel George T. Denison,
whose distinguished career as the promoter of Imperial unity has since made him famous in Canada
and far beyond it.

The circumstances of the time, the distrust between the races and the vacillation of a sorely
pressed government, combined to make an awkward situation.  The evidence does not show that
the Ontario agitators let slip any {168} of their opportunities.  The government was compelled
to send under Colonel Wolseley an expeditionary force of Imperial troops and Canadian volunteers
to nip in the bud the supposed attempt to establish French ascendancy on the Red River.  This
expedition was completely successful without the firing of a shot.  Riel, at the sight of the
troops, fled to the United States, and the British flag was raised over Fort Garry.  So, in
1870, Manitoba entered the Dominion as a new province, and the adjacent territories were organized
under a lieutenant-governor and council directly under federal jurisdiction. Out of them, thirty-five
years later, came the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

But the fruits of the rebellion were evident for years.  One result was the defeat in Ontario
of Sandfield Macdonald's ministry in 1871.  'I find the country in a sound state,' wrote Sir
John Macdonald during the general elections of 1872, 'the only rock ahead being that infernal
Scott murder case, about which the Orangemen have quite lost their heads.'[1]

When order was restored the clever miscreant Riel returned to the settlement.  By raising a
force to aid in quelling a threatened Fenian {169} invasion, he gulled Bishop Taché and the
new governor, Adams G. Archibald, and had himself elected to the Dominion parliament.  But
Riel's crimes were too recent and too gross to be overlooked.  His effrontery in taking the
oath as a member was followed by his expulsion from the House; and once more he fled the country,
only to reappear in the rôle of a rebel on the Saskatchewan in 1884, and, in the following
year, to expiate his crimes on the scaffold.

Having carried the Dominion to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, the next step for the government
was the acquisition of British Columbia. After the Oregon Treaty of 1846 the British possessions
on the Pacific coast lay in three divisions, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and the Stikeen
Territory, all in the domains of the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1863, after the inrush of gold-seekers,
the two latter had been united under one government and granted a Legislative Council, partly
elective.  Vancouver Island already had a legislature with two chambers, one elective.  In
1865 Amor DeCosmos, one of the members of the Assembly for Victoria, began the union movement
by proposing that Vancouver Island should be joined to British Columbia.  There {170} was friction
between the two colonies, largely on commercial grounds.  A tariff enacted by the colony on
the mainland proved injurious to the island merchants who flourished under a free port.  So
in 1866 the Imperial parliament passed an Act uniting the two colonies.  Despite the isolation
of the Pacific coast settlements from the British colonies across the continent on the Atlantic,
the Confederation movement had not passed unnoticed in the Far West; and in March 1867 the
Legislative Council of British Columbia adopted a resolution requesting Governor Seymour to
take measures to secure the admission of British Columbia into the Dominion 'on fair and equitable
terms.'  In transmitting the resolution to the home authorities the governor candidly pointed
out the difficulties.  He was not strongly in favour of the policy.  The country east of the
Rocky Mountains, it should be kept in mind, was still in the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company.
An alien population from the United States was increasing in number. Enormous obstacles stood
in the way of communication eastward.  'The resolution,' wrote Seymour, 'was the expression
of a despondent community longing for change.'  However, a public meeting in Victoria held
on January {171} 29, 1868, urgently recommended union.  A memorial to the Canadian government
declared that the people generally were enthusiastic for the change.  The leading newspapers
endorsed it.  The popularly elected councils of Victoria and New Westminster were of the same
mind.  Opposed to this body of opinion were the official class and a small party who desired
annexation to the United States.  The terms demanded were the assumption by Canada of a debt
of about $1,500,000, a fixed annual subsidy, a wagon-road between Lake Superior and the head
of navigation on the Fraser within two years, local representative institutions, and representation
in the Canadian parliament.

  Years of doubt and trial
there were, but in due course the Nova Scotian came to regard himself as a Canadian and the
British Columbian ceased to feel that a man from the East was a foreigner.  The provinces have
steadily developed a community of interest.  They meet cordially in periodical conferences
to discuss the rights and claims possessed in common, and if serious, even menacing, questions
are not dealt with as they should be, the failure will be traced to faulty statesmanship and
not to lack of unity.

{189}

To preserve the Imperial tie was the third and greatest object of the Fathers.  They realized
that many dangers threatened it--some tangible and visible, others hidden and beyond the ken
of man.  It may not be denied that the barque of the new nationality was launched into an unknown
sea.  The course might conceivably lead straight to complete independence, and honest minds,
like Galt's, were held in thrall by this view.  Could monarchy in any shape be re-vitalized
on the continent where the Great Republic sat entrenched?  What sinister ideas would not the
word Imperialism convey to the practical men of the western world?  These fears the Fathers
met with resolute faith and the seeing eye.  They believed that inherent in the beneficent
rule of Queen Victoria there was a constitutional sovereignty which would appeal irresistibly
to a young democracy; that unwavering fidelity to the crown could be reconciled with the fullest
extension of self-government; and that the British Empire when organized on this basis would
hold its daughter states beyond the seas with bonds that would not break.

And so it has proved.  Of all the achievements of the Fathers this is the most splendid {190}
and enduring.  The Empire came to mean, not the survival of antiquated ideas, but the blessings
of a well-ordered civilization.  And when in 1914 the Great War shook the world, Canadians,
having found that the sway of Britain brought them peace, honour, and contentment, were proud
to die for the Empire.  To debate the future of Canada was long the staple subject for abstract
discussion, but the march of events has carried us past the stage of idle imaginings.  A knowledge
of the laws by which Divine Providence controls the destinies of nations has thus far eluded
the subtlest intellect, and it may be impossible for any man, however gifted, to foresee what
fate may one day overtake the British Empire.  But its traditions of freedom and toleration,
its ideals of pure government and respect for law, can be handed on unimpaired through the
ages.  The opportunity to maintain and perpetuate these traditions and ideals is the priceless
inheritance which Canada has received from the Fathers of Confederation.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The printed material relative to Confederation is voluminous.  The earliest proposals are to
be found in the Constitutional Documents by Shortt and Doughty.  The parliamentary debates
of the four provinces from 1864 to 1867 record the progress of the movement which culminated
in the British North America Act.  For the intimate history of the coalition ministry and the
conferences in Quebec and in London the two works by Sir Joseph Pope, Memoirs of Sir John Macdonald
and Confederation Documents, are mines of indispensable information. It would have to administer when
