Truly I cared very little for angling, but I had discovered that Walkirk was an indefatigable
and patient fisherman. I had intended that he should cross the stream with me, but it now occurred
to me that it would be far better to let him stay on this side, while I pursued my researches
alone. Accordingly I proposed that he should fish in the part of the stream which I had seen
the day before, while I pressed on farther. "In this way," I remarked artfully, "we shall not
interfere with each other." Had I supposed that there was the slightest possibility of the
appearance on the stream of the apparition of the day before, I should have requested Walkirk
to fish from the top of a distant tree. But I had no fears on this score. If what I had seen
had been a phantasm, my under-study would have to doze to see it, and I knew he would not do
that; and if what I had seen was real, it would not appear this morning, for the water was
too low for swimming. The creek, as I now perceived, was affected by the tide, and its depth
was very much less than on the preceding afternoon.

I turned to the right, and followed the stream for some distance; now walking by its edge,
and now obliged, by masses of undergrowth, to make a detour into the woods. But, that see more connection,

regard of Sir Laurence Altham for Mind Jonas Flicker.



After a walk of perhaps a quarter of an hour I stopped suddenly. I had discovered something.
I looked about me, utterly amazed. I was on the little beach which the Sand Lady had assigned
to Walkirk and me as a camping ground.

I sat down, vainly endeavoring to comprehend the situation. Out of the mass of wild suppositions
and conjectures which crowded themselves into my mind there came but one conviction, and with
that I was satisfied: Sylvia was here.

It mattered not that the Sand Lady had said that hers was the only house upon the island; it
mattered not that Captain Jabe had said nothing of his neighbor; in truth, nothing mattered.
One sister of the House of Martha had come to this place; why not another? What I had seen
in the woods had been no fantasy. Sylvia was here.

XXXI.

TAKING UP UNFINISHED WORK.

My reasons for believing that Sylvia was on this island were circumstantial, it is true, but
to me they were entirely conclusive, and the vehement desire of my soul was to hasten to the
house and ask to see her. But I did not feel at all sure that this would be the right thing
to do. The circumstances of this case were unusual. Sylvia was a sister of a religious house.
It was not customary for gentlemen to call upon such sisters, and the lady who was the temporary
custodian of this one might resent such an attempt.

It was, however, impossible for me entirely to restrain my impulses, and without knowing exactly
what I intended to do I advanced toward the house. Very soon I saw its chimneys above the trees
which partly surrounded it. Then, peeping under cover of a thicket, I went still nearer, so
that, if there had been any people in the surrounding grounds, I could have seen them; but
I saw no one, and I sat down on a log and waited. It shamed me to think that I was secretly
watching a house, but despite the shame I continued to sit and watch.

There was the flutter of drapery on a little porch. My heart beat quickly, my eyes were fixed
upon the spot; but nothing appeared except a maid who brought out some towels, which she hung
on a bush to dry. Then again I watched and watched.

After a time four people came out from the house, two of them carrying colored parasols. I
knew them instantly. There was the Middle-Aged Man of the Sea, and his friend the Shell Man;
and there was the Sand Lady, and my enemy who called herself a Person. They went off toward
the little pier. Sylvia was not with them, nor did she join them. They entered their boat and
sailed away. They were going fishing, as was their custom. The fact that Sylvia was not with
them, and that no one of them had stayed behind to keep her company, caused my heart to fall.
In cases like mine, it takes very little to make the heart fall. The thought forced itself
into my mind that perhaps, after all, I had seen a vision, and had been building theories on
dreams.

Suddenly the shutter of an upper window opened, and I saw Sylvia!

It was truly Sylvia. She was dressed in white, not gray. Her hair was massed upon her head.
There was no gray bonnet. She looked up at the sky, then at the trees, and withdrew.

My heart was beating as fast as it pleased. My face was glowing, and shame had been annihilated.
I sat and watched. Presently a door opened, and Sylvia came out.

Now I rose to my feet. I must go to her. It might not be honorable to take her at this disadvantage,
but there are moments when even honor must wait for a decision upon its case. However, there
was no necessity for my going to Sylvia; she was coming to me.

As she walked directly to the spot where I stood, I saw Sylvia as I had seen her in my day-dreams,--a
beautiful girl, dressed as a beautiful girl should dress in summer time. In one hand she carried
a portfolio, in the other a little leathern case. As she came nearer, I saw that she was attired
exactly as Mother Anastasia had been dressed when I met her here. Nearer she came, but still
she did not see me. I was not now concealed, but her eyes seemed fixed upon the path in which
she was walking.

When she was within a hundred feet of the thicket through which her path would lead, I advanced
to meet her. I tried to appear cool and composed, but I am afraid my success was slight. As
for Sylvia, she stopped abruptly, and dropped her leathern case. I think that at first she
did not recognize me, and was on the point of screaming. Suddenly to come upon a man in the
midst of these solitudes was indeed startling.

Quickly, however, I made myself known, and her expression of fright changed to one of amazement.
I am happy to say that she took the hand I offered her, though she seemed to have no words
with which to return my formal greeting. In cases like this, the one who amazes should not
impose upon the amazed one the necessity of asking questions, but should begin immediately
to explain the situation.

This I did. I told Sylvia how I had been accidentally brought to Captain Jabe's house, how
I had strolled off in this direction, and how delighted I was to meet her here. In all this
I was careful not to intimate that I had suspected her presence in this region. While speaking,
I tried hard to think what I should say when she should remark, "Then you did not know I was
here?" But she did not make this remark. She looked at me with a little puzzled wrinkle on
her brow, and said, with a smile:--

"It is absolutely wonderful that you should be here, and I should not know it; and that I should
be here, and you should not know it."

Ever since my meeting with Mother Anastasia it had been my purpose, as soon as I could find
or make an opportunity, to declare to Sylvia my love for her. Apart from my passionate yearning
in this direction, I felt that what I had done and attempted to say when I had parted from
my secretary made it obligatory on me, as a man of honor, to say more, the moment I should
be able to do so.

Now the opportunity had come; now we were alone together, and I was able to pour out before
her the burning words which so often, in my hours of reverie, had crowded themselves upon my
mind. The fates had favored me as I had had no reason to expect to be favored, but I took no
advantage of this situation. I spoke no word of love. I cannot say that Sylvia's demeanor cooled
my affection, but I can say that it cooled my desire for instantaneous expression of it. After
her first moments of astonishment, her mind seemed entirely occupied with the practical unraveling
of the problem of our meeting. I endeavored to make this appear a very commonplace affair.
It was quite natural that my companion and I should come together to a region which he had
before visited.

"Yes," said she, "I suppose all out-of-the-way things can be made commonplace, if one reasons
long enough. As for me, of course it is quite natural that, needing a change from the House
of Martha, I should come to my mother's island."

"Your mother!" I stammered.

"Yes," she answered. "Mrs. Raynor, who spends her summers in that house over there, is my mother.
Her brother is here, too, and she has some friends with her. Mother Anastasia was away recently
on a little jaunt, and when she came back she said that I looked tired and wan, and that I
ought to go to my mother's for a fortnight. So I came. That was all simple enough, you see."

Simple enough! Could anything be more extraordinary, more enigmatical? I did not know what
to say, what course to pursue; but in the midst of my surprise I had sense enough to see that,
until I knew more, the less I said the better. Sylvia did not know that I had visited her mother's
island and her mother's house. It is possible that she did not know that Mother Anastasia had
been here. I must decide whether or not I would enlighten her on these points. My disposition
was to be perfectly open and frank with her, and to be thus I must enlighten her. But I waited,
and in answer to her statement merely told her how glad I was that she had a vacation and such
a delightful place to come to. She did not immediately reply, but stood looking past me over
the little vale beyond us.

"Well, here I am," she said presently, "and in a very different dress from that in which you
used to see me; but for all that, I am still a sister of the House of Martha, and so"--

"So what?" I interrupted.

"I suppose I should go back to the house," she answered.

Now I began to warm up furiously.

"Don't think of it!" I exclaimed. "Now that I have met you, give me a few moments of your time.
Let me see you as you are, free and undisguised, like other women, and not behind bars or in
charge of old Sister Sarah."

"Wasn't she horrid?" said Sylvia.

"Indeed she was," I replied; "and now cannot you walk a little with me, or shall we sit down
somewhere and have a talk?"

She shook her head. "Even if mother and the rest had not gone away in the boat, I could not
do that, you know."

If she persisted in her determination to leave me, she should know my love in two minutes.
But I tried further persuasion.

"We have spent hours together," I said; "why not let me make you a little visit now?"

Still she gently shook her head, and looked away. Suddenly she turned her face toward me. Her
blue eyes sparkled, her lips parted, and there was a flush upon her temples.

"There is one thing I would dearly like," she said, "and I think I could stay for that. Will
you finish the story of Tomaso and Lucilla?"

"I shall be overjoyed to do it!" I cried, in a state of exultation. "Come, let us sit over
there in the shade, at the bottom of this hill, and I will tell you all the rest of that story."

Together we went down the little slope.

"You can't imagine," she said, "how I have longed to know how all that turned out. Over and
over again I have finished the story for myself, but I never made a good ending to it. It was
not a bit like hearing it from you."

I found her a seat on a low stone near the trunk of a tree, and I sat upon the ground near
by, while my soul bounded up like a loosened balloon.

"Happy thought!" she exclaimed. "I came out here to write letters, not caring for fishing,
especially in boats; how would you like me to write the rest of the story from your dictation?"

Like it! I could scarcely find words to tell her how I should like it.

"Very well, then," said she, opening her portfolio and taking out some sheets of paper. "My
inkstand is in that case which you picked up; please give it to me, and let us begin. Now this
is a very different affair. I am finishing the work which the House of Martha set me to do,
and I assure you that I have been very much dissatisfied because I have been obliged to leave
it unfinished. Please begin."

"I cannot remember at this moment," I said, "where we left off."

"I can tell you exactly," she answered, "just as well as if I had the manuscript before me.
Tomaso held Lucilla by the hand; the cart was ready in which he was to travel to the sea-coast;
they were calling him to hurry; and he was trying to look into her face, to see if he should
tell her something that was in his heart. You had not yet said what it was that was in his
heart. There was a chance, you know, that it might be that he felt it necessary for her good
that the match should be broken off."

"How did you arrange this in the endings you made?" I asked. "Did you break off the match?"

"Don't let us bother about my endings," she said. "I want to know yours."

XXXII.

TOMASO AND LUCILLA.

On this happy morning, sitting in the shade with Sylvia, I should have much preferred to talk
to her of herself and of myself than to dictate the story of the Sicilian lovers; but if I
would keep her with me I must humor her, at least for a time, and so, as well as I could, I
began my story.

The situation was, however, delightful: it was charming to sit and look at Sylvia, her portfolio
in her lap, pen in hand, and her blue eyes turned toward me, anxiously waiting for me to speak;
it was so enchanting that my mind could with difficulty be kept to the work in hand. But it
would not do to keep Sylvia waiting. Her pen began to tap impatiently upon the paper, and I
went on. We had written a page or two when she interrupted me.

"It seems to me," she said, "that if Tomaso really starts for Naples it will be a good while
before we get to the end of the story. So far as I am concerned, you know, I would like the
story just as long as you choose to make it; but we haven't very much time, and it would be
a dreadful disappointment to me if I should have to go away before the story is ended."

"Why do you feel in a hurry?" I asked. "If we do not finish this morning, cannot I come to
you to-morrow?"

"Oh, no, indeed," she answered. "It's only by the merest chance, you know, that I am writing
for you this morning, and I couldn't do it again. That would be impossible. In fact, I want
to get through before the boat comes back. Not that I should mind mother, for she knows that
I used to write for you, and I could easily explain how I came to be doing it now; and I should
not care about Uncle or Mr. Heming; but as for Miss Laniston,--that is the lady who is visiting
us,--I would not have her see me doing this for anything in the world. She hates the House
of Martha, although she used to be one of its friends, and I know that she would like to see
me leave the sisterhood. She ridicules us whenever she has a chance, and to see me here would
be simply nuts to her."

"Is she a bad-tempered lady?" I asked. "Do you know her very well? Could you trust her in regard
to anything important?"

"Oh, I know her well enough," said Sylvia. "She has always been a friend of the family. She
is wonderfully well educated, and knows everything and has never married, and travels all about
by herself, and is just as independent as she can be. She has very strong opinions about things,
and doesn't hesitate to tell you them, no matter whether she thinks you like it or not. I have
no doubt she is perfectly trustworthy and honorable, and all that; but if you knew her, I do
not think you would like her, and you can easily see why I shouldn't want her to see me doing
this. It would give her a chance for no end of sneers at the work of the sisters."

"Has she never said anything about your acting as my amanuensis?" I asked.

"No, indeed," replied Sylvia. "You may be sure she never heard of that, or she would have made
fun enough of it."

It was impossible for me to allow this dear girl to remain longer in ignorance of the true
state of affairs.

"Miss Raynor," I said,--how I longed to say "Sylvia"!--"I am ashamed that I have allowed you
to remain as long as this under a misunderstanding, but in truth I did not understand the case
myself. I did not know that the lady of this house was your mother, but I have met her, and
have been kindly entertained by her. I did not know Miss Laniston's name, but I have also met
her, and talked to her about you, and she knows you used to write for me, and I do not like her."

Sylvia answered not a word, but, as she sat and looked at me with wide-open eyes, I told her
what had happened since my companion and I had landed at Racket Island. I omitted only my confidences
to Mother Anastasia and Miss Laniston.

"Mother Anastasia has been here," repeated Sylvia, "and she never told me! That surpasses all.
And mother never mentioned that you had been here, nor did any one." She gazed steadfastly
upon the ground, a little pale, and presently she said, "I think I understand it, but it need
not be discussed;" and, closing her portfolio, she rose to her feet.

"Sylvia," I exclaimed, springing up and stepping nearer to her, "it must be discussed! Ever
since I parted from you at the window of your writing-room I have been yearning to speak to
you. I do not understand the actions of your family and friends, but I do know that those actions
were on your account and on mine. They knew I loved you. I have not in the least concealed
the fact that I loved you, and I hoped, Sylvia, that you knew it."
