CHAPTER I.

    Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll;
    . . . . . .

SEPTEMBER 27, 1607.

Dead bodies everywhere. The ocean, lashed to fury by the gale of yesterday, came booming and
hissing upon the beach in great breakers white with foam; each billow as it dashed upon the
jagged and broken rocks bore in its terrible embrace still more human victims, or some portion
of the two unlucky ships that were fast breaking up. One wedged in between two rocks with just
sufficient play to allow of its heaving from side to side, with every wave that struck it.
The other and much larger vessel, the Queen Elizabeth, a fine British ship, which had sailed
from England freighted with a cargo of general merchandise for the colony of Virginia, went
crashing up against the cruel stone teeth of the cliff which overhung and projected into the
angry sea; dismasted, her bulwarks and rigging torn away she floated out into deeper water
only to be driven back again upon the rocks, by the violence of the wind and the rapidly incoming
tide.

Another crash and another, the forecastle carried away, the decks opening, bales, chests, cordage,
stores of all sorts tossed high up on the shore, more dead bodies--chiefly of men, for they
had some time before given up to the few women and children the now capsized and shattered
boats. What i want you gentlemen to state me is why these rats congregate at times in certain buildings
of serious City, in the large years that they are a time to property and away human life, and,
actually, as suddenly disappear as they appeared.

"" are they lived then doing that? "asked Professor Wilson phoenix, who had so go vitally interested
in crossfire." suppose they are?

"queried Carol Crawford, biologist problem for the." that is nothing
more than they have done for centuries. "" do you mean migratory
motion?

"asked
the answering winters, Rastell." Rats have always transmigrate. ""
i mean nothing of kind, "protested Crawford." i intend their sudden
agerasia in a town and has a building, their remaining there kill
for a time and abruptly their sudden disappearing.


Every sound was lost in the terrific roar of the great, heaving hills of water, which rolled
in continuously; huge masses of wet gray cloud hung over all, obscuring or transforming every
visible object. Far up among the shingle lay one human form which still bore signs of life.
It was that of a young lady, attired in deep mourning, a stream of blood trickled down the
pale face, and from time to time one hand moved convulsively toward a deep cut in her head
as if to assuage the pain; presently in half-consciousness she whispered "Do not tell my mother
I am hurt, it would grieve her. She has had too much sorrow already."

The beloved mother, and all others who had made life precious to the speaker, had three years
previously been tenderly laid to rest in their quiet graves thousands of miles away; but at
this moment the mind had only half awakened. A few minutes later her brain was clear and active,
and the truth flashed upon her in all its force. The recollection of her bereavement and the
fact of her being utterly alone in life, were the first thoughts that came and the thoughts
which dominated. And so it is that all who are called upon to endure a great sorrow, acutely
realize that sorrow again and again with each return of the mind to the consciousness of human
existence, whether it be after the delerium of fever, the stunning from an accident, or the
awaking each morning to daily life. With the awaking to our senses assuredly comes the old
heartache; nay, before we awake it is there, and before we are conscious of aught else we are
conscious of the grief which weighs heaviest on our soul. Thus it was with Anna Vyvyan: the
awaking to life brought with it the pain in all its intensity, although she lay there on the
cold stones, her clothing drenched through and through, bareheaded, her hair matted together
with the sea water, bruised and cut and faint from exhaustion, still the present physical suffering
seemed by comparison nothing to her. Everything was buried in the sorrow of the past, the sorrow
that she had lived through, but had not left behind.

CHAPTER II.

    The stately homes of England
      How beautiful they stand,
    Amidst their tall ancestral trees,
      O'er all the pleasant land!
    The deer across their greensward bound
      Through shade and sunny gleam,
    And the swan glides past them with the sound
      Of some rejoicing stream.

    The blessed homes of England,
      How softly on their bowers,
    Is laid the holy quietness
      That breathes from Sabbath hours
    Solemn, yet sweet, the church bell's chime
      Floats through their woods at morn,
    All other sounds at that still time
      Of breeze and leaf are born.

Miss Vivyan was the daughter of an officer of high rank in the navy of Queen Elizabeth, who
lost his life in the royal service while his little girl Anna was still very young. His valor
had gained for him many medals and yet more substantial honors in the form of valuable grants
of land from Her Majesty. This property, added to the family inheritance of Anna's mother,
who was a lady of old and noble race, left both the widow and her child in very affluent circumstances.
The young widow, handsome and possessed of brilliant talents, attracted many suitors for her
hand; but her heart lay far down beneath the sea with her dead husband, and she resolved to
devote her love and her life to the care of her child. She accordingly retired to an old manor
house on the borders of Wales, which had descended to her through many generations. The great
stone halls and corridors, the long, low rooms and the little diamond-shaped window panes,
admitting so small an amount of light, might have given to some minds a feeling of gloom; but
both mother and daughter had their occupations, the one in giving, the other in receiving,
an education, beside the care of all the sick and poor peasants of the neighborhood. Indeed
they were so happy in their affection for each other and found so much to do, that they had
neither the time nor the inclination to cultivate morbid or gloomy thoughts, which would, they
felt, make their companionship an infliction on every one whom they approached, and unfit them
for the duties of their position. So life went on calmly and happily with them.

A faithful steward attended to the estates and a good old housekeeper managed the servants,
always keeping order, discipline and peace in the establishment. Twice a year they were allowed
to have a dance in the servants' hall, one at Christmas and the other on Anna's birthday, on
which occasions they invited the sons and daughters of the neighboring farmers, and the tradespeople
who supplied the manor house. The village shoemaker, the tailor, and the blacksmith were the
musicians, and to the strains of two violins and a clarionet, they merrily danced through the
livelong night, such good old figures as Sir Roger de Coverly, Speed the Plough, and the Cushion
dance, till the rising sun streamed in at the windows and warned them that it was time to blow
out the candles, take off their holiday garb, and assume their daily work. As for the mistress
of the mansion, she found her pleasures in the duties of her position and the rich companionship
of a well stocked library. She had no neighbors of her own rank within several miles distance,
no one to visit or to be visited by, with the exception of the old bachelor clergyman of the
parish, whose formal calls took place at stated intervals, unless some sudden case of want
among the poor caused him to ask her aid, for he knew very well that her heart and hand went
forth on every occasion of distress. Hers it was to soothe and cheer and comfort and help,
and many a thorny path was made smooth and many a heavy burden lifted by her brave and generous
spirit and the pleasant, cheerful way she had of doing such things. In the presence of others
she made a duty of cultivating cheerfulness of manner. Not that she ever for a moment forgot
the recollection of her love and her loss; but she considered her sorrows too sacred for a
subject of conversation on one hand, and on the other, that her grief was her own, and that
she had no right to intrude it upon others, or to weigh down and sadden their lives by what
was sent for her to bear. Hence her presence was always welcome to the peasants, who regarded
her with reverence and affection, as she passed, accompanied by her little daughter, from cottage
to cottage leaving some dainty for the sick, or an article of clothing for the needy.

Years went by and Anna had left babyhood far behind her and was now a girl of fifteen. Her
mother at this period, decided that it was time to call in the aid of masters to assist in
her daughter's education. Accordingly, such were summoned from a distant town. There was a
master for the minuette and the gavotte, a master for the harpsichord, a master for the French
and Italian languages, and so on. The days and hours were all laid out systematically, giving
an abundance of time for physical training and out-door life, but with the exception of the
masters for music and dancing (more especially the former) none of these instructors made much
impression upon the girl's mind. Her heart and soul were given to music. While she was in the
house her time was spent between the old church organ that stood in the hall, and the harpsichord
which adorned the long, oak-panelled drawing-room. When out of doors she was forever listening
to the music of nature, the wind through the trees, the dash of the water-fall, the rippling
of the brook, all had their charm and fascination, for nature never played out of tune. She
would try to make out what key these sounds were in, whether they varied at different seasons,
or if change in the weather made them alter,

    Music was her passion, her love, her life.

Just at that time, two new inmates were added to the manor house family. Young Cecil Vyvyan,
a cousin of Anna's, who was of the same age as herself, and his tutor, Dr. Strickland, a grave,
middle-aged Scotch doctor of philosophy. The boy's parents were in India, which caused the
widow to suggest to them that he should, for a few years, make his home with her, in order
that she might watch over his health, which was exceedingly delicate.

It was in the twilight of a day late in the autumn that Anna waited in the large old-fashioned
library to make the first acquaintance of her cousin. In the broad stone fireplace, logs of
beech and chestnut were piled up on the hearth, across brass dogs, where they blazed, and glowed,
and lighted up the comfortable looking room, with its dark, massive, carved oak furniture,
its painted glass windows, its rich but faded velvet draperies, interspersed here and there
with a piece of old tapestry, the needlework of the ladies of former generations. A few family
portraits, and well-filled bookcases of vellum-bound octavos, quartos and folios. As the butler
threw open the door of the room and announced Master Cecil Vyvyan, Anna went forward to greet
the latter, and almost gave a start of surprise at seeing the real cousin differ so much from
the ideal one which she had pictured to herself; for she expected to find Cecil of the same
type as the English boys that she had always seen. She thought he would be large of his age,
with a fresh rosy complexion, bright eyes, an open countenance, crowned with masses of rich,
curling locks. Strong and healthy, overflowing with buoyant spirits, agile and ready for active
service either of work or play. Instead of which there stood before her one of small stature
and thin, diminutive figure, with a pale, weary-looking face and tired eyes, which apparently
did not observe any of the objects by which he was surrounded, but concentrated their gaze
upon the young girl only, with whom he stood face to face, carefully regarding her with that
scrutiny which we are all wont to use when we first make the acquaintance of a new relative.

Anna gave him her hand and welcomed him with a few kind words. As the boy and girl stood there,
no two cousins could have appeared more externally unlike, and yet never were two more alike
in their highest tastes and deepest feelings. But an ordinary looker-on would only see the
boy so small, and quiet, and weary, and the girl so tall, and active, and healthy, abounding
in lively spirits, in the full enjoyment of her young life, with the mother she adored, thinking
nothing could be more beautiful than her picturesque old home and its surroundings of hill
and valley, and woodland, and broad green meadows, and turning over in her mind how she would
show Cecil all the favorite haunts. The lily pond in the park, the finest view of the Welsh
mountains, and the right place for a good gallop--then the ponies, and the dogs, and the fish
pools.

"You must be tired from so long a journey, Cousin Cecil," said she, "let me bring this armchair;
it is the most restful one in the whole house. It has a pedigree, too, the same as you and
I have. It belonged to our great-grandfather, Sir Vyell Vyvyan, and was made more than a hundred
years ago from one of the oaks which grew in the north grove in the park," so saying she laid
one hand on the back of a huge, cumbersome piece of furniture, and rolled it across the room
up in front of the glowing logs.

It was now Cecil's turn to be amazed, how could she move that great, clumsy thing, he pondered
to himself, I could not. With a gentle thank you, and bowing gracefully to her, he sank into
their great-grandfather's chair, and was almost lost sight of among the ample velvet cushions.

Anna who had seated herself on one side of the fireplace, was watching the pale face, and the
weary eyes that were looking dreamily at the fantastic shapes which from time to time the glowing
embers assumed. Presently a slight, convulsive shudder passed through the boy's frame and a
quiet little sigh escaped him.

He is sad, thought Anna, perhaps he is thinking of his home in Calcutta, poor fellow, I must
do something to amuse him. At the same instant, what she considered a very happy thought suggested
itself.

"I am so glad you came, Cousin Cecil," said she "they say you will soon get well and strong
here. I have a little terrier that catches rats, you shall take him out in the morning, if
you like, and the gardener's boy will show you where you can kill plenty."

"I don't kill rats," he replied, still keeping his eyes fixed upon the burning logs and striving
to follow the outlines of a fairy island with palms and tropical plants and ferns as tall as
forest trees, which, in his imagination, he saw there.

"Do you go with your terrier to kill rats?" he inquired, with the slightest tone of sarcasm
in his voice.

"Oh, no," replied the girl, "but I thought you would like to. Most boys are amused by it, they
call it sport, and you know the rats must be killed or we should have them running behind the
wainscot of all the rooms in the house, and the gamekeeper would not be able to rear the young
pheasants, and we should have no chickens nor pigeons, nor anything of the kind."

"Why, Cousin Anna," said the boy, "have you a Scotch governess, and does she make you give
a reason for every thing, and give you her reason in return? That's what Dr. Strickland does
with me. It tires me dreadfully, and I don't see what use it is, for I always know things without
reasoning about them; they come to me of themselves."

Anna, in her eagerness to show kindness to the guest of the house, and to divert what seemed
to her his sad thoughts, did not stop to make any reply, but rose and hastily crossed over
to one of the bookcases, bringing back in her arms a large folio, full of colored illustrations
of field sports.

"Now, Cousin Cecil," said she, drawing up a chair close by the side of his, and laying the
folio open upon her lap, "this will please you I am sure; this is not about rats, but thorough-bred
horses and dogs, stag-hounds and fox-hounds. Did you ever hear that our grandfather kept a
pack of fox-hounds here, that is a hundred dogs you know. I will take you to the kennels and
the huntman's lodge some day soon."

Cecil did not know that a hundred dogs made a pack, for he had passed all his life in India,
until a few months previous to his coming to the manor house.

"Look at this picture of coursing, here is another of hawking, and now see these otter hounds."

"The landscape is beautiful," said the boy. "I like the soft gray light on those distant hills
in the background, but I do not care about pictures of horses and dogs; please take them away.
I like to see the animals moving in the fields, but I think all this kind of sport is very cruel."

This was said in an extremely gentle way, and at the same time with an inflection of the voice
which made a deep impression upon his listener. I wonder what I can do to amuse him, thought
Anna; I don't suppose he would care to look at my last piece of embroidery, or hear how many
sonatas I can play; I am afraid he is sorry he came here, perhaps he was thinking of the Himalaya
mountains, when he said he liked those hills in the picture. Most boys like out-door amusements,
she again thought to herself, and acting upon the idea of the moment.

"Cecil," said she, "we have two capital ponies, we will go out in the forenoon to-morrow if
you like, for we are to have a holiday from our studies all day, in honor of your coming here."

Again a gentle "thank you" from Cecil, his tired eyes still seeking air castles among the red
and gray embers of the fire. After some minutes silence, he turned to look at the tall old
clock in the corner, which, in addition to the hours and minutes depicted upon its face, was
adorned with supposed likenesses of the sun and moon and other heavenly bodies, beside the
terrestrial globe which represented Jerusalem as being situated in the very center of the earth's
surface.

The same old clock, which had stood in the same corner of the library long enough to mark the
hours of the births and marriages, the meetings and partings, and death, of several generations
of the Vyvyans, now chimed in slow, subdued tones, through which ran the echo of a wail, like
the voice of a human being, who has seen much and suffered much.

"Dr. Strickland will expect me to return to him now, Cousin Anna, so I must say 'good evening'."

"Before you go, Cecil, tell me at what time you will be ready to ride with me to-morrow?"

"I must ask my tutor," he replied.

"Very well, you can let me know at breakfast time. I suppose you can find your way to your
part of the house, follow straight along the corridor till you come to the south wing at the
end. Your study and all the other rooms for you and Dr. Strickland are there. Good night."

The next day the ponies were brought round to the hall door immediately after luncheon, and
the boy and girl were mounted. Cecil, whose chief mode of locomotion had hitherto been in a
palanquin, did not by any means enjoy his present situation; but as he made no remark, his
cousin supposed he was as pleased and jubilant at having an opportunity of seeing the beautiful
surroundings of the place as she was showing them. They rode through the park, down the long
avenue of oaks and beeches, and out by the keeper's lodge to the lake, and then away over the
hill among the scattered cottages of the peasants, who touched their hats or curtsied as the
cousins rode by. Anna always returning their salutations with some pleasant word or nod, or
an inquiry after their welfare. At last they turned their ponies homeward. The boy all the
while silent; the girl chattering and explaining and repeating anecdotes which had been told
to her, and laughing merrily at the ludicrous passages in them. As they were again entering
the park, the boy's riding whip slipped out of his hand and fell to the ground. Looking at
his cousin with a grave expression of face, he said,

"I have dropped my whip, what shall I do?"

"Dismount and pick it up," replied Anna.

"But I cannot," he replied, "I am afraid I could not mount again without the groom to help me."

"Very well, then I will get it," so down she sprang, passed up the whip to Cecil, and bounding
into her saddle again was off at a canter before the boy could say a word.

"Come along, Cecil," she cried, looking back, "come along, this is the finest stretch of ground
in the country for a race."

CHAPTER III.

    No--that hallowed form is ne'er forgot
        Which first love traced;
    Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot
          On memory's waste.

Dr. Strickland and his pupil had been fairly ensconced, and for some time past settled in the
pretty, sunny rooms in the south wing of the manor house. All the windows of the lower suite
opened to the ground, and overlooked and led into a Dutch flower garden, which, in accordance
with its name, was laid out in formal walks with high box borders on each side, and stiffly-shaped
flower beds of poppies, and tulips, and marigolds, and clusters of monkshood, and the tall
white lilies of France, edged round with thyme and sweet basil. In the soft green turf, were
planted evergreen trees, which were cut and clipped into fantastic shapes of peacocks, and
pyramids, and cubes, and swans, and other devices. Here and there were clumps of holly and
yew, from the midst of which some fawn or dryad, some Hebe or Flora, in Italian marble, had
long kept watch. Then there were the old cedars of Lebanon, with seats encircling their great
trunks, the ends of their long branches lying on the grass, offering beneath them, rest and
shade at any hour of the day. The western side of the garden terminated in what was known as
Lady Dorothy's walk. A straight, long, gravel walk, bordered on either side by a few feet of
soft turf, and an avenue of yew trees two centuries old. The small closely-growing foliage
of these trees was so dense that it formed a perpetual green wall, effectually shutting out
all the world, with the exception of the sun at noonday, and the stars and moon at night. At
the head of the walk was a sundial, and at the further end a fountain. Not a great, noisy,
conspicuous construction, suggestive of the rush and turmoil of life, drowning in its splash
all the sweet sounds of bird and bee, and the marvelous music of nature, but a pure, gentle,
dainty little fountain, the sound of whose crystal drops, so full of soothing and tenderness,
fell upon the ear like the voice of the one we love. Near the fountain was a rustic seat from
which one might look across the park with its forest trees, its green undulations, and its
lake, and still further away westward to the purple Welsh mountains. In every way this was
a beautiful garden, a place to dream of, and live, and love, and die in.

Springtime had come, and Cecil and his tutor were sitting in their study, looking out at the
linnets flitting about the garden, and at the primroses and blue violets which grew in front
of the windows. The lessons of the day were over, and the Doctor was pursuing his favorite
amusement, namely, drawing mathematical deductions, and coming to logical conclusions upon
all matters. Although he was a ripe scholar, he would frequently forget himself, and break
out in his strong Scotch accent; but that signified nothing, as Cecil perfectly understood
his speech, and the family all liked him, for they knew he was a good man and greatly interested
in the well-doing of his pupil.

"Ye had a lang walk wi' your cousin this morning," said the Doctor. "I hope ye understand her
better than ye did."

"I am not sure that I do," answered Cecil. "I don't see why she moves so quickly and is always
well; I don't like people who are always well, they cannot feel for others."

"Ye should no say that, Cecil, when ye look at your aunt; she's no invalid, but she gi'es up
her life for the sak' o' others. Did ye ken that these verra rooms are the anes she likes most,
the anes she lived in till we came, and she gave them up that ye might enjoy the best she had
to offer?"

"O yes, I know that," said Cecil. "My aunt is very kind, but I was not thinking of her when
I spoke, I was thinking of Cousin Anna; she runs so fast and when she is not singing, she is
laughing, and I don't believe she has any nerves, for the other day my pony got a stone in
his shoe, and she was off hers in a moment, seized my pony's fetlock and snatching up something
in the road, knocked out the stone and mounted in less time than I have taken to tell you.
Now none of the young ladies in India would take a pony's fetlock in their hand, so I think
Cousin Anna cannot possess nerves."

"In one respect ye are right," said the Doctor, "Such a young leddie as ony o' those we used
to see in India, would ride on and leave ye, and when she got home, she would tell one of the
servants to tell some one of the other servants to see aboot it, and when they had passed the
order through half a dozen, in the course of a few hours perhaps one of them would be with
you, and, in the meantime, she would be lying on the sofa, with Shastri standing by, fanning
her out of her nervous shock."

"But think of the first day I rode with my cousin, she surprised me so when she picked up my
whip, I thought then she had no nerves."

"Admitting such a statement to be true," replied the Doctor, "which we are by nae means sure
of, for the truth has no been logically proved, I say, admitting that it be true, is it no'
a gude thing for ye that your cousin has nae nerrves, if ye are to gang aboot drapping things
that ye dar' na pick up again. In the sense that ye appear to desire your cousin to hae nerrves,
I dinna ken mysel' what use they wad be to a young leddie wi' a speerit such as she has. I
wad no' wish to see a lassie o' her years hae nerrves; na, na, she wad no hae ony use for them;
Providence kens what is guide for us a', and will send her the nerrves when she is fit to manage
them."

"Still I don't see," said Cecil, "why she is not frightened sometimes. Perhaps she may be,
but if so she will never say so; I don't think a girl ought to be so fearless."

"Perhaps ye dinna ken that young leddies o' her rank in England are all educated in that way.
The English hae this proverb amang them. 'A well-born woman is ever brave.' Your cousin inherits
her courage a long way back, she is no mongrel born; I wish ye to see for yourself, Cecil,
that it is a gude thing to be brave. There are mony ways o' showing it beside being a soldier
or a sailor." And then the Doctor dropped his Scotch accent and spoke slowly, "We ought to
be brave enough to do our duty to others," said he. "And now I will give you six reasons for
being brave for the sake of those we love. Firstly, brave that we may inspire them, with courage
when their hearts are weary. Secondly, brave that we may be patient and gentle when their nerves
demand rest. Thirdly brave that we may be kind and diligent and loving when they are sick.
Fourthly, brave that we may not be morbid and gloomy and thus depress them. Fifthly, brave
that we may be faithful and true in all things. Sixthly, brave that we may endure without murmuring
to the end."

Long after the Doctor had left the room, Cecil was still there, leaning his head against the
side of the window and thinking over this conversation. He possessed a generous disposition,
and could not bear the idea of having misjudged his cousin. Period.

 Anna's first thought
was to see if any sign of life remained in the slender form before her, but she could find
no pulse, and the face and hands were as cold, as the rocks upon which she was lying. Miss
Vyvyan unfastened the child, and drew away the long sash, which had tied her to her mother's
waist. As she did so, she observed the delicately formed features, which were so regular and
proportionate that they might have been chiseled in marble, to represent some Greek goddess.
She saw the masses of soft brown hair, and the long dark eyelashes, which dropped upon the
cheek like silken fringe. She observed, too, the simple traveling habit, made of the finest
material, but perfectly free from any attempt at vulgar ornament. And as she took the child
into her arms, and looked down once more on the sweet white face, which lay on the stones at
her feet, and noted the refinement in everything about her, she knew that the little one's
mother came of gentle blood. The child was willing to go to Anna, but not willing to be removed
out of sight of its mother. So Miss Vyvyan sat down where they were with the little one in
her lap, and shook out the silk sash with the idea of wrapping it round the shivering child,
but that, too, was wet, every thing in the shape of clothing was wet, both on Anna and the
child. All that she could do for the moment to comfort the tiny thing, was to fold it in her
arms, and try by that means to keep it from perishing with cold. It had probably been shielded
by some heavy woolen wrap, which was torn off by the breakers when they were cast on shore,
for as Anna shook out the silk sash, there fell from it a strip of thick woolen fringe, which
had the appearance of having belonged to a shawl.

But now the child was bareheaded, and wore a little white dress of exceedingly fine embroidery,
which also spoke of the mother's love, for none but loving hands ever wrought work so dainty
as that. Round its neck was clasped a small gold chain of minute links of very fine workmanship.
So thin and delicately was it made, that it resembled a thread of golden silk. Anna examined
it carefully to see if she could find any letter or name upon it, but none was there, then
she spoke to the child as it lay nestling its pretty head upon her arm, and still talking to
its mother, and said,

"Tell me, dear little one, what is your name?"

The child looked up, but evidently could not understand the meaning of her words.

Anna tried again by laying one of her fingers on the child's shoulder and saying, "Who's dat?"

"Mama's baby," answered the little one in an instant.

"Will Mama's baby tell me where papa is?"

"Dorn seep," replied the child.

"Tell me where dorn seep, sweet child."

"Down dare," answered she, pointing to a mass of human bodies which were thrown together on
the beach some distance below them, and which were constantly kept in motion by the incoming tide.

Anna's desire to die no longer existed; as she held the beautiful little creature to her heart
and rocked it, all her thoughts concentrated in the one question, what could she do to aid
this sweet helpless one. The ideas rushed through her mind with the rapidity that they come
to us in fever. It must have warmth and food, or it will perish. I cannot let it die, it is
so beautiful, and I love it. I must act this moment. Rising with the child in her arms, she
hastened along as rapidly as she could among the wreckage, scrambling between bales and chests
of all kinds, in the hope of finding something, anything; she could not surmise what it might
be, but some sustenance must be had for the child. Although hundreds of cases and bales were
strewed about, they were all so securely corded and nailed up, that it was impossible to procure
anything from them.

At last, far in on the land, she came to a large pile of freight, which had struck so violently,
that the greater number of the cases and bales, had broken in two, or had burst open. The first
object that met her sight, was a broken chest full of table covers of rich cloth, evidently
the product of India and Persia, as the silk embroidered borders in oriental needlework showed;
happily everything was thrown in so far that it was dry.

Taking one of the table covers, she wrapped it round the child, who in the midst of its discomfort
showed its gentle nature by saying,

"Pitty sing, pitty sing," and holding up its sweet face to kiss Anna.

"Yes, mama's baby shall have more pretty things soon," said Miss Vyvyan.

"Dinner," cried the child, "bing dinner, Dinah bing dinner."

"Yes, darling, we must find dinner for mama's baby."

"Dinah bing dinner?" again repeated the poor, hungry little thing, with an expressive look
of interrogation.

"Yes, dear, yes;" folding the soft woolen cover still more closely round the child, Anna placed
her in a sheltered spot. "Stay there a moment, baby, while I bring dinner."

From the marks on the outside of the boxes it was plain that they had come from some Mediterranean
port, and contained fruits and other edibles. With a heavy stone, Anna soon broke open a small
box of candied fruit, selecting some, she gave it to the half-starved child. One of the baby
hands held her fruit, the other one was instantly stretched out toward the box.

"Mama, tandy, too," she cried.

"Mama is asleep, darling, she does not want candy."

"Oh mama, tandy, too," she repeated, with an earnestness that sent a thrill through Anna's heart.

"Yes; mama's baby shall take some if she wishes to."

The child took a piece of the fruit, "Doe now," she said.

"Go where, baby?"

"Mama," answered the child, struggling among the folds of her wrap, to get on to her feet and
pointing in the direction of its mother. A nature so full of love, shall not be pained or thwarted
by me, mused Anna, as she carried back the child who had already become precious to her. When
they reached the place where the cold white mother was lying, and Anna was in the act of putting
the little one on the ground as it desired, an unusually large wave broke so close by, that
the spray and foam dashed against, and flowed over the sweet pale face. The child uttered a
sharp cry of distress, and disengaging itself from Anna's arms and darting to its mother, threw
itself down by her side, and, clasping her neck with its tiny arms, covered with kisses the
face that was so dear. The next wave will carry the mother away, Anna thought. I cannot let
the child witness such a sight, it would break her loving little heart, and she also felt that
she, herself, could not give up to the all-devouring ocean, the object of so much affection
in the babe. Placing the little one in safety, she took up the cold, white burden in her arms,
and carried it far back from the reach of the sea, putting it down on the moss, at the root
of a large pine. As it lay there so lone and sad and beautiful, with the child standing by
it, for the little soul had followed with its swiftest steps, Anna bent over it and kissed
the face. Poor dear, she murmured in a whisper, as long as I exist, my love and my life shall
be devoted to your child. She bent again and kissed the cold lips. Could it be possible that
breath came lightly through them? It was,--it was,--deeper and deeper drawn and more regular
each time. Merciful God, she lives, and the tears fell fast from eyes that had long been dry
with grief. A faint sigh, and the partial parting of the long silken eyelashes, told that life
was coming back still more and more. In a few moments she feebly uttered, "My child."

"Your child is safe and with you," replied Anna, lifting the little one closer to its mother's
side.

"Dudley," she faltered.

"He has not come yet," said Anna, surmising for whom she was inquiring, and pitying in her
inmost soul the widowed heart that must so soon learn to live without him.

When the poor mother opened her eyes, the scene of horror was more than her delicate organization
could endure, and a violent, fit of trembling came upon her.

"Tote on," said the anxious, sensitive child.

The suggestion was acted upon, Anna ran to the pile of dry wreckage, and soon returned, with
an armful of table covers and a box.

"Tote on mama," cried the child hurriedly, as if it felt there was no time to be lost.

"Yes, darling, a coat for mama," said Anna, improvising a pillow with one, and wrapping several
other warm covers about the shivering mother.

"Take this," said she, holding to her lips some cordial which she had poured into a mussel
shell, "It is buanaba, a very delicate restorative made in Turkey, pray try to take it, it
will keep you from shivering so."

As we have already said, Anna possessed great vital energy, and with her to think was to act.
She saw that the delicate, slender young mother and the child must both die, unless she could
find some means of getting them warm. There was an abundance of dead wood close by, if she
could only start the first spark of fire. Pushing her way a few yards into the forest, she
brought out a quantity of dead grass and resinous wood, and continued striking two stones together
until at last the spark came, and a good fire soon blazed high, and sent out its glow toward
the pine tree beneath which they were lying. Some large stones were soon heated in the hot
embers, and rolled to the feet of the mother. Covering was brought and held to the fire, and
the lowly bed made so warm that the exhausted mother and her little one fell into a natural
and refreshing sleep. In the meantime Anna was everywhere scrambling and climbing among the
freight, dragging what she could not carry, searching for anything that might be appropriated
as a covering against the cold, and looking after the cases of eatables with a thought for
the poor, starving ones under the pine tree. It was late in the afternoon when the sleepers
awoke. The mist had in a great measure cleared away, and the sunlight was straggling through
the remaining clouds. A good fire was burning, and a tin of water was boiling beside it. A
long box cover, supported by stones at each end, formed a table, other box lids made seats,
and the table was spread with food that would at least sustain life. Heaped up under another
pine tree, was a sufficient supply of both food and covering, to provide for the ladies and
child for some time to come. There was no lack of tins of all shapes, so they were made use
of to cook in, and for holding food. As soon as the child was thoroughly awake, it sat up in
its bed, showing its sweet fair face, and smiling with happiness at finding its mother awake
by its side. Taking up a cup of food made from sea moss and sweetened with the candied fruit,
Anna attempted to feed the child by means of a shell, but it turned its face away, and said
in tones full of distress, "Mama too, Dinah bing dinner." When Anna took hot coffee from the
fire and propped up the exhausted mother and induced her to drink it, everything went well
with the child. It was perfectly satisfied, and took its own food, and laughed and played with
the pebbles and shells that were brought to it.

"I have tried often, very often to speak to you," said the mother, addressing Anna for the
first time; "I was conscious, but I could not speak; I was too weak I suppose, and now my voice
has come back to me, I have no words, I do not know what I can say to you."

"Will you let me suggest what you shall say," asked Anna? "It is this; say what I can do that
would most help you and your lovely child; and now try to rest while I think how you can be
sheltered from the night air, for night will be upon us in the course of two hours at furthest."

The fog and mist had now completely disappeared, and given way to the sun, which, however,
was nearing the horizon, and the trees cast long shadows on the grass.

While the mother and child had been asleep in the afternoon, Anna had built up a few broken
boards and stones between them and the sea, that they might not be pained on their first awaking
by seeing the terrible sight which was so near.

"I am better," said the mother. "I feel stronger. I cannot endure to see you doing all. I want
to help you. I do not need more rest now. But tell me first, pray tell me the truth, whatever
it may be. Is there any one left alive here besides ourselves. Have you seen an officer in
a colonel's uniform? My husband was in the service of King James, he wore the royal uniform,
when he tied my child to my waist with his sash, and lifted me into a boat. I cannot remember
any more. I think I must have been stunned. How long have we been here? I seem to have lost
some of the time, but I felt you take away my child, and I heard you speak tenderly to it.
Have we been here too long for my husband to be living? Tell me, can it be possible that I
may find him?"

Anna could not add to her anguish by repeating what the child had said when questioned about
its father, for she believed it had spoken truly when it answered,

"Dorn seep, down dare."

"I do not think we have been here longer than to-day," she replied. "I do not know exactly.
It was early in the morning when our ship struck the rocks, but it was broad daylight when
I came to my senses on the shore. The tide was coming in, it was very high, and now it must
have been going out for nearly four hours, so I think we must have been cast on shore this
morning."

"Then my husband may still be alive, I must seek him." With those words, she rose to her feet,
but nearly fainted with the effort.

"Your child is sleeping," said Anna. "Let me support you, if you will attempt to walk. Tell
me your husband's name, that I may call it aloud; these rocks are very rugged and I can send
my voice into places among them, that it would be impossible to go into."

"Colonel Carleton," she replied.

"Lean on me, Mrs. Carleton. Shall we go down this way?"

The tide had carried out the mass of floating bodies to which the child had pointed at noon,
but numbers of others still remained in all directions. Tottering and staggering among the
dead, Mrs. Carleton continued her search, until she had looked into every ghastly face that
lay there.

"Now will you call aloud for me," she said, "for I cannot, my strength is gone."

Anna called, but the only sound that came back was the echo of her own voice from the forest
and the heavy rolling of the sea. They returned in silence to the child, who was still asleep.
The sun had nearly set, when all at once a rich, bright glow from the west rose behind the
forest and flooded every object with golden light. Looking out to sea eastward, they observed
only a few miles away many islands, some of them covered with forests down to the water's edge.

"Where can we be," they both ejaculated at the same time. There was no habitation visible on
any of them, nor any smoke rising from them.

"These trees remind me of Norway," said Anna. "Do you think we can be in Norway?"

"I am unable to say," replied Mrs. Carleton, "but I am sure we are in a northern clime by the
growth both of trees and plants."

The ladies seated themselves by the sleeping child, trying to think what it was best for them
to do. There was no time for delay; it would soon be dark, and the little group of three appeared
to be the only living human beings in the place, wherever that place might be. While they were
talking together, they had turned their backs to the sea and were looking toward the sunset,
and watching the varied rays of light which here and there penetrated through the forest on
the hill before them.

"I did not hear your name, Mrs. Carleton, on board the ship I sailed in from England," said Anna.

"I did not come from England," she answered. "My parents settled in the colony of Virginia
long ago. I was born there, that is my home. My husband as well as myself, had many relatives
in England, and we were going to visit them, and intended to have our child baptized there,
that its name might be registered among those of its forefathers. Sometime after we sailed,
we fell in with buccaneers; but our ship, the Sir Walter Raleigh, was a fast sailor, and we
got away from them; yet I was told when the hurricane came on, that they were the cause of
our being out of our course, hence our calamity."

"We met the same destiny," said Anna, and then she told in a few words whence she had sailed,
and that her name was Vyvyan.

The hill in front of the ladies, rose too high for them to see the actual setting of the sun,
but the rich glow of gold and crimson now lit up the whole forest, and defined the outline
of the rising ground.

"What is that I see?" said Mrs. Carleton, shading her eyes with her hands.

"'Tall pines' I think," answered Anna.

"No, it is a tower; look, Miss Vyvyan, in that direction, see on the hill; it is a stone tower;
look, now the light has changed; there are windows, many of them, see on the right the building
extends a great way, it is very large."

Anna looked through the wood where Mrs. Carleton directed, and saw distinctly in the rosy light
of the sunset, an immense stone building, with a massive tower capable of containing many rooms,
and rising to the height of two hundred feet. With the exception of the tower, the building
was very irregular, and gave the impression of having been erected at different periods. It
combined the characteristics of a feudal castle and a fortress. It was old and gray, but by
no means a ruin, yet it had a gloomy and forbidding appearance. The ladies looked at each other
and hesitated, they did not speak for a few moments; the same idea possessed the mind of each.
They thought that good people would not live in such a place, amid such wild surroundings,
but neither one of them would unnerve the other by saying so, for they knew in their present
situation they required all the courage that they could command, in order that they might be
ready to meet their uncertain fate.

While they continued looking almost spellbound the child awoke, and observing their earnest
gaze, added her own scrutiny to theirs. She bent her little golden head forward and saw some
of the windows upon which the reflection of light glinted.

"Home," she exclaimed, smiling with childish glee, "doe home," taking hold of her mother's
dress to draw her in the direction of the building, which was about half-way up the hill, and
only a few hundred yards from where they now stood.

CHAPTER VII.

           *     *     *     *     *

    Act,--act in the living present!
      Heart within and God o'erhead!

           *     *     *     *     *

    Let us then be up and doing
      With a heart for any fate
    Still achieving, still pursuing
      Learn to labor and to wait.

The ladies held a consultation, should they attempt to go to the castle and ask for shelter.
How could the child, which like themselves had hitherto lived in luxury, pass a night on the
beach. Beside the forest looked as if it was the resort of wolves and bears. It would be unsafe.
They could not after dark remain where they were, there was no alternative, so they decided
to go at once to the building. There was no path, but they held the branches aside for each
other. Taking the child with them, they stumbled over the loose stones and among the briers
as well as their want of strength would permit, for they were much exhausted. Mrs. Carleton
was so weak that she fell several times and was severely hurt, but no murmur escaped her and
she rose and struggled on again as if nothing had happened, turning, from time to time, with
some word of kindness or cheer to Miss Vyvyan, who was helping the little one along.

Emerging from the woods, they found themselves in a long, open space of grass, which was surrounded
on all sides by the forest. The great building stood full in front of, and overshadowed them.
It was a veritable feudal castle and, as we have said, grand, gloomy and forbidding to look
at. The windows were far up from the ground, no entrance door was in sight, no walks or drives
around it, everywhere rank grass, with here and there a tuft of golden-rod, or fall aster springing
up. No smoke rising from any of the chimneys, no traces of footsteps, no sound but the sighing
of the wind through the pines, and the surging of the ocean. Mrs. Carleton was first to break
the silence.

"If I were by myself," said she, "I should imagine I must be dreaming, but I feel the reality
of our position, this is no dream. We are all alone here; this place must have been deserted
long ago. Look, there is the entrance overgrown with brambles. It is best that we are alone;
if we can get shelter, we need not fear molestation."

She spoke calmly and cheerfully and tried to wear a smile for the sake of the two who were
looking at her and listening to her words. Anna had entertained grave fears for Mrs. Carleton
while they were getting up to the castle. She thought the delicate frame must give way altogether,
but she now saw that her newly-made friend was as brave, as she was gentle and loving and faithful,
and fear gave place to hope and resolve. As she went a few steps to gather some asters, which
the child wished for, she said to herself, "This fragile, suffering, uncomplaining woman has
already taught me a great lesson, and I will never seek selfish relief by adding to her overburdened
life, the weight of my own sorrow. She shall always think me cheerful, whatever I may know
my self to be, for nothing that I can do will be of so much help to her and the sweet child."

As Anna returned, the little one stretched out her hands to receive the flowers and held up
the rosy lips to give a kiss for them, which was her usual mode of acknowledging any kindness
shown to her.

"Miss Vyvyan," said Mrs. Carleton, "I have been looking on the other side while you have been
gathering the flowers. I find there is an immense pile of ruins there, which looks as if it
were the ruins of a tower. That small entrance at the north end is the only one that is open.
Shall we try to get in, we can beat down the brambles."

The doorway was low and arched, the stone work about it coarse and massive, the door had fallen
from the upper hinge, and lay so far open that ingress was very easy. The ladies entered and
passed into a broad stone passage, which was many yards in length and led to a staircase at
the foot of the great tower at the south end. As they passed along the passage, they saw a
number of rooms on either side, which were all in semi-darkness, being lighted only by narrow
loopholes in the outer walls, yet there was sufficient light to show them that they were all
well filled with what appeared to be chests, boxes and packages, but the ladies were too much
fatigued to make any examination of them. They observed that the walls were all of rough stone,
but there was no feeling of dampness. On reaching the staircase, Mrs. Carleton discovered some
inscriptions cut deep into the wall.

"What is this, Miss Vyvyan? I see it is not Greek or Latin or Hebrew. I never saw any characters
like these."

"They are runic," replied Anna. "I should not know what they are, only that I have seen them
on old ruins in Norway. Do you think we are in Norway? This old castle is very much like buildings
I have seen there."

Mrs. Carleton, who was an excellent botanist, again referred to the trees and plants which
they had seen as they came up from the beach.

"Those fall asters," she said, "and the species of golden-rod are both of northern growth,
but I cannot in the least feel sure of our whereabouts. It scarcely seems probable that we
shall find the means of getting away from this place very soon, for there is no evidence of
any commerce here, and as far as I can judge, nothing for merchants or traders to come for.
I do not say this to dishearten you, Miss Vyvyan, but I feel it right that we should speak
openly and honestly to each other."

"I understand you," replied Anna, "you do not wish to fill my imagination with false hopes;
it is good, and kind, and sensible, and I thank you for speaking as you have done. I feel myself
that this is no time for dreaming, and I do not any longer care to indulge in it. All I care
for, is to lead an earnest, true life in whatever position Fate may place me. If we are destined
to remain together, you shall see."

The ladies had now ascended the winding stone staircase as far as the top of the first flight
from the ground. From the stairs, they stepped into a corridor with a stone floor and bare
stone walls, somewhat similar to the one below, but wider and well lighted. From this corridor,
branched off other passages and staircases, leading both above and below, and numberless rooms
of all kinds, the doors of which were chiefly open, showing the most luxurious and costly furniture,
and the richest hangings, containing chests filled with rich velvets and satins, and all other
requirements of ladies' dress. Some rooms were evidently sleeping apartments, others were furnished
as parlors, the walls being hung with tapestry, and adorned with rare paintings and mirrors
in frames of the most exquisite workmanship, in ivory, silver and bronze. Rich carpets and
rugs covered the floors. The rooms all felt dry. They had wide, open fireplaces in which stood
fire dogs of brass or iron; in some of them still remained half-burned or charred logs, and
the dead ashes of long years ago. The ladies remarked that, amidst all this abundance of wealth,
there was a certain incongruity in the arrangement of the contents of every room. In one they
found silk draperies from India, a divan from Turkey, an Italian settee in the finest Florentine
carving; beside it a massive English table of heart of oak, and the light, spider-legged gilt
chairs of Paris, with their faded red silk cushions, and so on. They rambled through room after
room. In many of them were firearms of all dates and nations, sabers and cutlasses, daggers
and swords, with pistols and guns, and powder flasks, and spears. Some of these lay upon the
tables and chairs, and others hung from the walls. In all the sleeping-rooms, were numberless
articles of men's dress, uniforms and costumes of various kinds, sufficient in variety to supply
disguises for a whole regiment. With the exception of the number of firearms and other instruments
of warfare lying about, the rooms were all in order. The reflection of the setting sun streamed
in at the windows, and across the floors at the west side of the castle, and lit up the mirrors,
and pictures, and beautiful and curious works of art, which hung on the walls, or stood on
the shelves, or on quaint pieces of furniture, and which abounded everywhere and made the interior
of the building a pleasant contrast to the gloomy-looking outside.

Passing hastily through the rooms which led off the corridors, the ladies returned to the great
tower at the south end. They found the door, which gave entrance to it was closed; but on Mrs.
Carleton laying her hand upon the lock, it at once gave way, and they went through a vestibule,
and entered a large and very handsome room. It was octagon in form, with a window in every
division. The upper part of each window was made of antique painted glass, which shed red hues
of crimson, gold and purple in different parts of the room, ever varying their position with
the change in the sun's altitude, and giving the apartment at all times of the day, a bright,
cheerful appearance. This room was furnished still more gorgeously than any of the others.
The walls were hung with the richest kinds of Spanish tapestry; on a ground of dark green silk
velvet, was embroidered large flowers and arabesques in gold, interspersed at intervals with
the well-known representations of the three castles, which are a part of the arms of Spain.
The furniture was all of chestnut, carved in the deeply cut and highly raised work, which is
so rich and elaborate, and peculiar to the Spanish artists. Several curiously cut mirrors hung
on the walls, and also some exceedingly delicate paintings in ivory, and, a number of choice
enamels on plaques of gold. The mantel piece of stone was high and adorned with beautiful vases
of Egyptian and Etruscan make, mingled with those of Rome and Herculaneum, and the more modern
flower-holders of Bohemian and Venetian glass. The sofas, as well as the luxurious armchairs,
were covered with green silk velvet. The window draperies were of the same, ornamented with
gold fringe.

The floor was made of various kinds, inlaid in mosaic work, as we see them in Italy. Soft ruby
colored rugs were lying in front of the table, and before the fireplace. On one side, was a
small carved bookcase containing a few volumes of novels, some of poetry and a few sacred books
of the Roman Catholic creed, all of them in Spanish.

In one or two of the books, the name of "Inez" was written. Across the end of one of the sofas
lay a guitar of satin-wood, inlaid with mother-o'-pearl, with a Spanish lace mantilla by the
side of it, and on a small table close by was an open music book containing Spanish songs.

Everything gave evidence of having been left untouched for many years, the flowers in the vases
had dried, and fallen bit by bit, and lay in small heaps that looked like chaff. In one corner
of the room stood a tall Chinese jar, that had once contained sprays of the fragrant fir balsam,
which was now little else than dust. In the wide, open fireplace on the hearth, the wood that
had been carefully placed on the dogs ready to light, had become so dry, that it had crumbled
away, and fallen to pieces with its own weight.

The ladies felt the importance of using the remaining daylight in making some preparations
for the night, so deferred any further examination of the castle until the next day. They experienced
a certain feeling of safety in being alone.

"Mrs. Carleton," said Miss Vyvyan, "you will not mind if I run down to the beach, and bring
up some of the table covers and some food. I shall soon be back again."

"I do not mind being left, but I do mind your doing it without help; I want to help you in
everything, but I am not strong enough yet. We will stand by the window and watch you as far
as we can."

The child understood the conversation, and turning with a very earnest and inquiring look to
her mother, she said,

"Be back."

"Yes, dear, Miss Vyvyan is coming back. That is my little one's way of saying she wishes you
to return," said Mrs. Carleton. "She always says to me, if I am leaving the room, 'be back,'
she means come back."

"I like to hear her say it," said Anna; "it sounds so real and so pretty, and it is her own
way of expressing what she desires. I hope you will always allow her to keep that little remnant
of babyhood. I ask it of you as a favor."

"I am only too glad, Miss Vyvyan, to do anything you wish," replied Mrs. Carleton.

As Anna left the room and hastened down the tower stairs, she heard the sweet little voice
calling after her,

"Be back, be back."

Mrs. Carleton had prepared a pleasant surprise for Anna on her return. She had taken a flint
from the lock of one of the guns, and had succeeded in lighting a cheerful fire, before which
the ladies spread the table covers, and slept until the light of the morning sun shone in upon
them through one of the painted windows, and made brilliant hues in various parts of the room,
which the child called butterflies. The little party was rested and refreshed, and awoke to
be greeted by a beautiful day.

As soon as they had breakfasted, they began a thorough investigation of their new abode. They
descended to the basement where they had entered, and discovered in one of the rooms immense
stores of provisions of all kinds, many of them in good order, for they were in sealed jars
and cases. One of the down-stairs rooms was a carpenter's shop, containing tools of all sorts,
which were of great use to the ladies in opening many things that it would have been impossible
for them to do otherwise. There was a large store of wine, and a kitchen containing strangely
shaped cooking utensils from different countries. Near the small north doorway by which the
ladies entered the castle, was a narrow stone staircase, leading down under ground, but it
was so dimly lighted, that they did not attempt to go down it. Ascending again to the tower,
they discovered several more beautiful rooms in it, all richly furnished. All these rooms had
apparently been set apart for the use of the lady, with the exception of one, a library, containing
carved oak shelves, loaded with books in many different languages; the heavy furniture was
also of carved oak, cushioned with old gold embossed leather. A Spanish cloak of crimson velvet
was thrown across the back of one of the chairs, and upon the seat of it lay a sombrero with
a plume, also a sword and a pair of gauntlets. An arched doorway in one corner of the library,
led into a small watch tower, the whole size of which was filled up by a winding stone staircase.

"Come, Miss Vyvyan," said Mrs. Carleton, "we will go up here, and we may, perhaps, see something
that will tell us where we are." They climbed the stairs to the top, and passed through a low
door on to the battlements of a great tower, whence they looked down at the pine trees, two
hundred feet below. They saw at once that they were on an island; not by any means a large
one, and that the whole of it was covered by forest as far as the water's edge, excepting in
a few places where a bare rock or swamp intervened. They looked to the south and saw only the
open ocean. The day was clear and calm, and they could see away to the horizon. To the east
lay many other islands; then to the north the same sight met their eyes. Looking to the west
still more islands were to be seen, and also what appeared to be the mainland, and far away,
perhaps seventy miles off in the distance, a magnificent range of lofty mountains. Nothing
could exceed the beauty of the scene. As they walked round the top of the tower, looking down
upon all these forest-clad islands without any sign of habitation, Mrs. Carleton, turning to
Anna, said, "Let us try to think over all the maps we have studied in our geography lessons."

"Just what I have been trying to do," said Anna, "but I can only think of a great number of
islands in the Pacific ocean, and we know we are not there, and we are not in any of the West
India islands, for, as you say, the trees tell us we are in the north, and now that I see so
many islands, I know we are not in Norway. But is it not strange that the runic characters
are in so many places in this castle? See, here are more of them, exactly the same as I saw
when we were in Norway."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Carleton; "everything tells us we are in the north, and also tells us we
are alone. We may have to remain here, we know not how long, perhaps years; and then, too,
we have something else to consider. These trees show that the winters in this region are very
severe, as do also the rents in the rocks that we clambered among on our way up to the castle.
Those great fissures were all caused by the action of intense frosts, by such a degree of cold
as you and I have no idea of, excepting from what we have read. In a climate like this, we
know the winter sets in early, so I think, Miss Vyvyan, the only thing we can do is to prepare
for it immediately as soon as we can."

"I see; everything is exactly as you say," replied Anna, "and now let me ask you a favor. I
am stronger physically than you are, and I beg you to allow me to undertake the heavier share
of our occupation. Let me do all that requires to be done outside the castle, such as getting
wood and water, and whatever we may want from the wreckage, and you take charge of the inside
of our present home, in which you must allow me to help you. I understand you already, and
I believe you would do everything and endure all the fatigue without a murmur, but that is
impossible; you have not the strength, and you must try to be well for the sake of your dear
child."

Mrs. Carleton endeavored to remonstrate with Miss Vyvyan about the division of the toil, which
was so new and strange to each of them, for she was born with a great generous heart that was
ready and willing to do and die for others; but Anna would not listen to her sweet pleadings,
although in her soul she admired them.

"Bow wow," said the little one, pointing down to the forest.

The ladies looked over the battlements and, to their horror, saw three wolves creeping stealthily
along under the shadow of the great pines below. They thought instantly of the fallen door
at the entrance, and hastened down the tower stairs as far as the room hung with green velvet
tapestry, where they had passed the night, and which they decided should in future be their
sitting-room, so they named it the green parlor. As they entered, the glow of the cheerful
fire on the hearth, the beautiful prospect of forest and sea from the windows, and the child's
butterflies, glancing here and there, gave a bright and pleasant air to the room, but the ladies
felt much disturbed by the discovery of wolves so near them, and the knowledge of the open
door in the passage below.

"Miss Vyvyan," said Mrs. Carleton, "there are other doors of entrance to this, castle; I saw
them, we will go and see if we can open one of them; and then we will close up the door below
altogether."

At the end of a passage leading from the tower, and not far from the green parlor, they found
a massive door, strongly barred and bolted inside. They drew the bolts, and on opening it led
down on the outside, by a long flight of stone stairs to the grass below, and very near to
the place on which they stood on their arrival from the beach.

"We shall be safe in one respect now," said Mrs. Carleton, "for no animal can break this door
and we can keep it bolted."

The first thing to be done now was to close up the entrance down stairs. The ladies went down
and out through the door by which they had entered the castle at the north end. Quickly gathering
up some of the wood which lay round about them, they set fire to it, in order to scare away
any wolves which might be prowling near, and at once went to work, carrying stones from the
ruins of the fallen tower, and by their joint strength replacing the door. They next piled
up such a barrier of great stones behind it, that they were sure that no wolves could enter
that way. They had finished their first attempt at building and were about to go up again to
the green parlor, when the child with a little laugh and in its sprightly way cried out,

"Kitta, kitta, see kitta." At the same instant running as fast as her tiny feet could go, after
two small white kittens which the next moment disappeared down the half-dark stairs, that they
had noticed when they first arrived, but were too tired to investigate at that time.

They now looked down them and in the dim light, saw only a passage which led in the direction
of the fallen tower. They satisfied themselves that there was no opening from that to the outside
of the building, and concluded that the immense pile of ruins completely stopped up all means
of ingress that way, so they decided not to go to the bottom of the gloomy staircase for mere
curiosity, when time was so precious to them, for they felt as Mrs. Carleton had remarked that
winter might be upon them very soon. They passed all the remainder of the day in bringing up
from the beach such supplies as they most needed, and decided to devote a portion of each day
to this occupation as long as the weather permitted.

Before sunset they were all safe in the castle again, the child running about the room they
were arranging, and delighted with the many beautiful ornaments. The ladies made up their minds
to adapt themselves to their circumstances, and be as cheerful as they could, for the child's
sake. They selected the tower for their residence, as it contained the best rooms in the castle,
and the view from every one of them was beautiful. They could go up the watch tower and look
off from the battlements, over the islands and forests, to those majestic purple mountains,
whenever they desired to do so.

A sleeping room next to the green parlor was chosen for Mrs. Carleton. It was fitted up with
the same degree of luxury as most of the others, the furniture being of satin wood and ivory,
and the hangings and drapings of the bed and windows of pink velvet and white lace. Two curiously
wrought silver lamps stood on the dressing table, and showed that they had burned themselves
out. In front of the mirror was a jewel casket; it was open, and showed rings and aigrettes
of diamonds and emeralds. A few ruby ornaments lay on the table, and a string of pearls, also
a small lace scarf and a pair of lady's gloves, embroidered on the backs with gold. The curtains
and velvet draperies of the windows were completely closed, and the room looked as though some
one had dressed in it and gone away and left the lamps burning. Everything was a mystery to
the ladies which they could not unravel.

When the day was over, Mrs. Carleton and Miss Vyvyan sat beside the sleeping child, in Mrs.
Carleton's room. The fire was burning on the hearth, and the full moon poured its beams in
at the windows; they had no other light.

Mrs. Carleton spoke much of her bereavement, but struggled to be brave, and to resign herself
to a destiny she could not alter, at the same time revealing, quite unawares to herself, a
character full of intense affection, unselfishness and great courage.

As Anna watched the sweet, pure face so full of emotion and sensibility, and the firelight
flickered upon and lit up the refined features, her whole heart yearned toward her new friend,
and her own sorrow was buried in those of the forlorn young mother.

"I have been considering," said Miss Vyvyan, "about your child. Do you not think we ought to
make life as bright and happy as we can for her, and we can do a great deal, although we may
have to stay in exile for a long while. She need never suffer from that idea. All will depend
upon the way we educate her, and the way we live."

"Exactly so," replied Mrs. Carleton. "We will make our lives as good an example as possible;
we will bring her up, as far as circumstances will admit, the same as we would do if she were
in my old home. We cannot have the servants we have been accustomed to have, but we can make
this home a systematic one, and a refined one, and we must make it a cheerful one for her sake."

"There is one thing I feel very anxious about," said Mrs. Carleton; "my child has not yet been
baptized. As I told you, we were going to take her to England for that purpose. I should feel
happier if I could carry out my husband's wish, and be able to call her by the name he so much
liked."

"I can fully enter into your feelings," said Miss Vyvyan. "Why not baptize her yourself? I
presume you are familiar with the service, as we have baptisms in our church so frequently."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Carleton, "and I cannot see that there would be anything wrong in doing
so, myself, as there is not any one else to do it."

"It can no more be wrong," said Anna, "to repeat the baptismal prayers for your child, than
it is to offer up your daily prayers for her. Indeed to me it seems perfectly right, as we
are situated at present."

"I am glad you entertain those feelings on the subject, Miss Vyvyan," replied Mrs. Carleton,
"and as we are both of the English church, will you be godmother to my little one?"

"You confer great happiness on me," replied Anna, "by making such a request. What do you intend
to call her?"

"Cora was the name my husband wished her to be called," replied Mrs. Carleton. "And I desire
to add Caroline to it, as that is the name of my dear mother, and is now, alas, the only means
I have of showing my affection for her, who is perhaps at this moment mourning my absence."

"Will you baptize her to-morrow?" inquired Miss Vyvyan. "If you will, we can make a dress for
her in the forenoon. There is an abundance of white India muslin and cashmere, too, enough
I should say to dress her for years to come."

"Yes," answered Mrs. Carleton, "I like that idea, and we will keep her always dressed in white."

"And as to yourself," said Anna, "I ask you as a favor, to let me choose for you in this instance,
I wish you always to be beautifully dressed in colors, that will look bright and cheerful.
I think it will have an influence on the child's spirits and thence on her health. I do not
feel that we need to have any compunction about using the things we find here, for we see that
this place must have been deserted many years ago, and I cannot help thinking that all these
costly things are the plunder of buccaneers."

"Nothing is so probable," answered Mrs. Carleton. "Indeed, when we consider for a moment, everything
seems to say so. Many of those cases which still remain unopened are such as the merchants
bring to the colony of Virginia. I have seen similar ones there which came from foreign countries.
It occurs to me that all these stores are the cargoes of ships that have been robbed by those
desperate men who have been and still are the terror of the sea; but why they left this place
so suddenly is difficult to divine, unless, perhaps, retribution fell upon them when they were
out at sea on some of their marauding expeditions. Evidently a lady has lived here, too; perhaps
they took her with them on their last voyage, and she also may have been lost, so I think we
may feel we are not doing wrong in using such things as are necessary to our existence while
we are here."

The next morning the ladies were up early busying themselves with their preparations for the
child's baptism. As they sat by the open window in the green parlor, making the little white
dress, the sunlight falling upon the floor, the soft, warm breeze from the south coming in
upon them, and the beautiful child playing about the room, prattling to herself in her baby
language, and trying with her little hands to cover the colored shadows--butterflies as she
called them,--and to hold them in one place, they each of them thought to themselves how much
there is in life to make us happy; and yet, and yet, who can be happy when there is an empty
place which nothing here can fill. They neither of them expressed what they thought, for they
had each made a resolution to help the other.

The sea and sky were one beautiful blue; there was just sufficient breeze to cause white caps
at distant intervals, and to toss the surf lightly against the rocks.

The ladies finished their sewing, and with the child went out to gather some wild flowers to
adorn their parlor for the baptism. In a few minutes they saw a narrow path which they followed
and found that it lead to a well of pure water only a little way off. Below this was a swamp
surrounded by a luxuriant growth of asters of every hue, and white and pink spirea and golden
rod, and blue iris, and the delicate, rose-colored arethusa, and the blue fringed gentian abounded
on every hand; also shrubs of the bayberry, wild rose and sweet brier, with many beautiful ferns.

By Mrs. Carleton's refined taste the green parlor was soon transformed into a fairy bower.
The autumn sunshine sent a flood of golden light over all, and the child, dressed in its fresh
white attire, was baptized, and Miss Vyvyan was its godmother. The ceremony was just over and
the latter lady was still standing with the child in her arms, beside a large crystal bowl
which was placed on the table and embedded in green moss and wreathed round the top with white
roses. It contained the water from which the child had received the symbol of the Christian church.

"Now," said Mrs. Carleton, "I wish to say to you, Miss Vyvyan, that from this day Cora belongs
to both of us, to you as well as to myself; she will henceforth be our child. I want you to
have someone you can speak of as 'mine.' I am thankful that I never knew what it was to be
without someone of my own to love, who was near to me, but I can picture to myself what a death
in life such an existence must be to those who have to endure the separation, and I should
feel very selfish if I did not divide my happiness with you."

"I do not know how to answer you," said Miss Vyvyan. "I cannot say what I wish to. Will you
grant me one more kindness; that is, let Cora always call me by my name, Anna, and you do the
same. It is more than three years since anyone called me Anna; there is no one left to do so."

"I will," said Mrs. Carleton, "and to you I must be Ada, for so I am named. I am glad that
you are pleased at having Cora for your godchild. I thought you would be; that was a little
plan of mine. I wanted to do something to make you feel happier."

Gentle, loving Ada, always thinking of the good she could do to others, always self-abnegating,
always giving up her own happiness that others might receive pleasure; even in the midst of
grief, bereavement and exile, devising means to cheer a life that she saw was more lonely than
her own--such was her character.

The position in which Miss Vyvyan now stood as Cora's godmother created a sincere bond of friendship
between the two ladies, which as time went on developed into a lifelong affection. They each
understood and appreciated every thought and feeling of the other. The child, who was of an
intense and affectionate temperament, loved both of her guardians. She confided in Anna and
would stay with her for hours together, and she always demanded in her baby way that Anna should
partake equally with her mother and herself of everything that she deemed pleasure and enjoyment,
and if Miss Vyvyan remained long out of sight, inquiry and desire were expressed by Cora in
one little sentence, "Anna be back." At the same time, with an innate and delicate discrimination,
the child defined the distinction between her filial love for her mother and that given to
her friend in so natural a way that neither of the ladies could ever feel slighted or wounded
in the least degree.

CHAPTER VIII.

They had been domiciled in the castle for several days when Miss Vyvyan said,

"As I am to take care of the commissariat department out of doors, Ada, I think it would be
well for me to go down to the beach and bring up all the provisions I can, while we have such
fine weather, as we think the winter may be very long here, so if you consider it a good plan
I will fill another storeroom."

"We will all go down, Anna," replied Mrs. Carleton. "We have been here five days now, and I
hope the tide may have removed much that was distressing to see there."

When the ladies reached the beach it was as Mrs. Carleton had supposed, all the corpses had
floated away, but the whole beach and the shore far up from the sea was still strewn with wreckage.
They worked very diligently, making piles of many things that might be useful, little Cora
trotting about as busily as her companions, and helping as far as she knew how. It was scarcely
ten o'clock, but the ladies had been out in the sun for some time lifting and carrying heavy
burdens, an occupation which was as fatiguing to them as it was novel. So that they might rest
a little while, and get all the sea breeze that there was on that still day, they went out
on to a mass of high rocks, which projected into the ocean and formed a cove on each side.

Scarcely had they seated themselves, when they saw a gentleman climbing up from one of the
coves below and coming toward them. He was a young man perhaps twenty-seven years of age. As
he approached them, they noticed that his appearance was that of a gentleman of rank, his every
movement was full of grace and high breeding, his figure was slender and under the middle size,
and his face exceedingly handsome and refined. His bright chestnut colored hair was long and
fell in waving masses on his shoulders. He wore a small beard of the same hue, his dress was
very rich and elaborate, after the fashion of the time, and when he spoke, his voice and courtly
manner, told that he was what his appearance indicated. As soon as he came near to them, he
bowed low, and made a gesture with one hand, as if raising his hat, but he was bareheaded.

"Ladies," he began, "pardon me for intruding upon you, but for the love of heaven give me a
cup of water, it is many days since I moistened my lips, I have been shipwrecked on your coast."

The ladies were on their feet in an instant. Mrs. Carleton running to a birch tree a few yards
back from the beach, and breaking off a piece of bark, deftly bent it into a cup, which she
handed to Miss Vyvyan to fill from the same pond that had supplied them with water the first
day they were thrown upon the island. Refreshed by the draught the stranger tried to thank
them, but speech and strength failed him, and tottering a few paces toward the land, he fell
down insensible beside a fissure in one of the rocks. The ladies went to him.

"His hands are as cold as if he were dead, Ada," said Miss Vyvyan. "What will it be best to do?"

"What did you do for me, when you first tried to help me?" replied Mrs. Carleton.

"I tried to get you warm."

"Well, then, we must do that."

At these words, they simultaneously took off the outside wraps they wore, and laid them over
him, and hastened about among the wreckage, until they had a good supply of warm rugs and coverings.

"Where did you get those hot stones that you placed at my feet," said Mrs. Carleton?

"I made a fire and heated them."

Then we will make a fire and do the same thing.

They covered the poor fellow over, and put hot stones to his feet, and he seemed to be sleeping.
In the meantime they prepared some light food for him. They sat in silence near by, waiting
to see what they could do, should he return to consciousness. They observed the color coming
back to his face, and a bright pink spot burned on each cheek.

"I fear," said Mrs. Carleton, "fever is setting in. I will make something with the fruit we
brought down, that will quench his thirst."

The child seemed to echo the thoughts of her companions, seeing them anxiously engaged in ministering
to the sufferer. She began gathering up anything that she thought pretty, and laid it by his
side. Presently she went to him with a few wild flowers, which she had picked from the crevices
of the rocks and among the shore grass close by. She observed the ladies spoke in low tones
to each other and moved about very quietly. She knew there was some cause for this, for, young
as she was, she had already an idea of illness and suffering, and her little heart was full
of pity for others. She stood looking at him as he lay asleep before her, waiting with her
wild flowers, until the time should come for her to give them to him. "Poorest, poorest," she
repeated, at the same time stroking his hair with her baby hand. That was her own word, and
her own way of showing sympathy and pity. The little one's vocabulary was, at this period of
her life, very limited, but equally significant of all that she saw and felt. She possessed
no extraneous babble. The only words she was capable of uttering came from her heart; hence
they fell upon her hearers with all the beauty and strength of truth. "Poorest, poorest," she
again repeated; "dorn seep; papa dorn seep, too."

At the child's last sentence, a shudder quivered through Mrs. Carleton's frame, and a still
whiter shade passed over the already pale face. She clasped her little one close to her and
bowed down upon its head. She did not utter a sound. Her silence said more than any words could
have done, for hers was a sorrow that had no speech.

After a restful sleep, the young man awoke, and sitting up among the many rugs and coverings
by which he was surrounded, he looked about in every direction, and appeared to be endeavoring
to realize his true position. He saw the high tower of the castle rising so near to him among
the trees; he saw the ladies and the child, but he did not feel quite sure of the truth of
all he saw until Mrs. Carleton put a cup into his hand and said,

"This is a fever drink; will you take some? I have just made it from fruit, the same as we
make it in Virginia."

"Thank you," he said. "I know what it is. I am a Virginian. I sailed from that colony in the
ship Sir Walter Raleigh. Who has been so kind as to bring me all these rugs," he continued.

"We did," replied Mrs. Carleton, looking in the direction of Miss Vyvyan, who with the child
stood near them.

"What, with your own hands? I regret to have caused you so much trouble; although I am grateful
to you in the extreme, I would have preferred you to have given orders to some of your servants.
It is not seemly that ladies such you are should wait upon me; it is not consistent with the
chivalry of a gentleman."

"I understand your feelings on this subject," said Mrs. Carleton, "for I, too, am a Virginian;
but we have no servants now, and my friend and I are glad that we can be useful. It is five
days since your ship was wrecked, therefore we know that you must have suffered greatly. Pray
do not be disturbed by seeing us doing what little we can to save you from perishing; let me
assure you that we are very happy to do our utmost."

The young man bowed, his cheeks still wore the bright flush of fever which heightened the intensity
of his soft brown eyes, that beamed with gratitude.

"Do you say that you are a Virginian?" he inquired, addressing Mrs. Carleton.

"Yes," she answered; "we were in the Sir Walter Raleigh, too; that is to say, my husband and
child with myself, but I never saw any of the passengers. I remained in my cabin all the time
we were at sea."

"I recollect you, now," he said. "I saw Colonel Carleton lift you and your child into a boat
when our ship went ashore."

"Were you acquainted with Colonel Carleton?" she inquired. "He was my husband."

"We were not acquainted until we met on board, but during the several weeks we were at sea
we passed all the time together. You say he was your husband. Is it possible that generous-hearted
man is lost?"

Mrs. Carleton made an inclination with her head.

"Forgive me," he said, "my conversation has caused you pain."

"Please continue," she replied, "tell me all you know about him."

"I witnessed many of his acts of kindness during our voyage, and received kindness from him
at what I suppose was the last moment of his life. The boat you were in was full and I urged
him to get into another one, but he refused, saying, 'I can swim and you cannot.' At the same
moment he took hold of me and dropped me into the boat as easily as if I were a child. You
know how tall and powerful he was. The next instant your boat was capsized and I saw Colonel
Carleton leap into the sea and swim toward you. His hand was almost upon your arm, when an
enormous wave swept him out of sight. The same wave capsized our boat, and the next one threw
me into the cove below. I might have got away before, but part of a broken mast lay across
my chest and I was entangled hand and foot by the rigging. I could neither move nor call aloud.
I heard voices more than once, the voices of ladies. I believe it was your voice and that of
your friend, for I never knew my ear to deceive me. I saw corpses lying all around me. The
tide took them away and brought them back again many times while I was there. All one night
a dead hand lay across my throat, but I could not disengage my hands to remove it. I had no
fever; I was conscious of everything. The tide was higher than usual this morning. It lifted
the mast and I crawled from under it."

He appeared to suffer much from exhaustion and lay down again upon the rugs, and closing his
eyes remained silent. After a little rest, he again sat up and resumed his conversation with
Mrs. Carleton.

"I have a great love of music," he began. "I left the colony of Virginia with the intention
of going to London, to perfect my study of that divine art, under the direction of Orlando
Gibbons. He is very young to be a composer, but he is already of much renown."

For some time he continued to speak fluently on the subject of music, a subject of which the
ladies perceived he was a complete master. As he talked, he became full of enthusiasm, and
that wondrous light which belongs to genius alone illumined his beautiful, eyes and his whole
soul spoke through them.

"Ah, my madrigals," said he, "they will yet be sung to His Majesty, King James. My symphonies
I shall submit to Orlando Gibbons, then I shall hear them played by a full orchestra, the world
will hear, then justice will be accorded to me, the great masters will be my judges, genius
such as theirs allows them to be generous and true in their opinions of other men. They will
see me as I am. They will not condemn what they cannot understand. They will not call my life
useless, because my tastes, my talents and my whole being compel me to be different from those
among whom I live. I cannot help it, and I would not if I could."

An expression of mental pain passed over his face as he thus proceeded. "Why did my uncle call
my life and my work useless? It is hard to be misunderstood. If I can create out of my own
brain something that is pure and beautiful, that gives happiness, that draws coarse natures
away from their coarseness, to feelings more elevated, that can bring to some an ecstasy of
delight, to others a sweet calm. If I follow a pursuit which injures no human being, no living
creature, why am I to endure displeasure? Is it more manly, more noble to hunt the poor, panting
deer till it falls gasping on the ground, and then to save its life for the purpose of chasing
it again for sport? Is it more noble to ride races till the horses drop down dead? Tell me,
do such pursuits elevate or brutalize?"

Taking a roll of paper from his breast, he handed it to Mrs. Carleton, saying, "I have a symphony
here which I composed since I left my home; would you like to look at it? I wish my twin brother
Ronald could see this; he understands me, and he will understand my music, although since his
accident, his hand can no longer obey his will; yet he will read my symphony, aye, more, he
will play it in his soul. With it you will find a song also, the words and music are both mine;
when you have read it, will you hand it to your friend?"

Mrs. Carleton took the roll of music into her hand, but observing that the writing was almost
obliterated from having been so long wet with sea water, she passed it to Miss Vyvyan, who
sat a little farther off, desiring to spare him the pain of seeing that his composition was
destroyed. The many pages of music were entirely illegible, with the exception of part of the
refrain of the song, the words of which ran thus:--

    Bury me deep,
    Where the surges sweep,
    And the heaving billows moan.

At the bottom was the name "Ralph." The following part of the signature was destroyed.

As Anna read over the words of the song, she could not help feeling that they might be prophetic
of what was very near. She folded the paper together and returned it to him.

"Is that your signature?" she asked.

"Yes, that is my name," he replied. "Do you like music," he continued.

"I do," she said.

"How much do you like it?"

"I like it to such a degree," she replied, "that I think life is not life without music."

"Ah, that is what I think," he said. "But I am exhausted. Ladies, will you pardon me if I sleep
a little while? I want to get back my strength, that I may be able to wait upon you both, and
make all the return in my power for your great kindness to me."

He soon fell into a restless, broken sleep, constantly murmuring to himself incoherently.

"Anna," said Mrs. Carleton, "he is very ill, and it is almost sunset, and quite impossible
for us to take him up to the castle. We must make some shelter here for him; the breeze already
comes in from the sea much cooler, and the night will be cold." The ladies picked up loose
stones and planks and everything they could move, and formed a low wall around him, making
a place of shelter as large as a small room. They then drew up a portion of a sail and laid
it partially across for a roof. He still slept, but as they looked at him, they saw the fever
was rapidly increasing; a still brighter flush was on his cheeks; his lips were parched, and
his breathing distressingly short and oppressed.

"What can we do?" said Mrs. Carleton. "See there, Anna! The sun has gone behind the hill to
the west of the castle; it will soon be dark. It would be terrible to leave him here to perish,
for he needs great care, beside the wolves may come, and he is too ill to defend himself. Do
tell me what you think it best to do?"

"One of us must watch by him to-night, Ada," replied Miss Vyvyan, "and if he should be better
to-morrow, we may be able to get him up to the castle. I must be the one to watch. Little Cora
could not pass the night without you, and even if she could, you are not well enough yet to
be out in the night air. Let me go up and get a few things such as he may require. I will be
back very quickly."

When Miss Vyvyan entered the castle, the sun had set, and a dull gray hue had settled upon
every room. How dreary for poor Ada, she thought to herself, here almost alone, with the death
of her husband so recent, and so vividly brought before her to-day. She at once thought of
kindling a fire as the only means she had of taking away some of the gloominess of the place.
She did so, and then spread a supper table as temptingly as she could with the only food they
had at command, and hastened back again to the beach.

"He still sleeps," said Mrs. Carleton, "but his fever is very high. It distresses me to leave
you here, Anna, and I would not, but for little Cora's sake."

"I understand you," replied Anna; "I shall always understand you. We are not mistresses of
our own destiny; we have to do what we can, not what we wish. I know all that you would do
if you could."

As Mrs. Carleton took the child in her arms and turned her steps toward the castle, the moon
rose slowly from the sea and made a long, golden, glimmering path from the horizon to the shore.
It was the harvest moon, which was almost at the full. The night was light and still, with
the exception of the sound of the waves, which broke upon the beach below in one long, continuous
moan.

Anna watched beside her charge, sometimes moistening his parched lips, sometimes arranging
his improvised pillow, and listening to every sound both near and distant, with that quick,
discriminating sense of hearing which we acquire from watching over those we love, and which
she had learned during the last illness of her mother. The night was now far advanced. Close
beside her came the quick, hard breathing, and the indistinct murmuring of the sufferer.

From down below, still arose the mournful tones of the heavily rolling waves, and from the
forest came the howling of the wolves, but she could hear they were not near; and resolved
if they should approach to scare them away, by setting light to a pile of wood which Mrs. Carleton
had laid together for that purpose.

As she sat there on the ground and realized her situation, a feeling almost of terror came
over her. During the past few years, she had gone through the discipline of a long lifetime.
This night, the past and present seemed to combine to crush out the remnant of courage that
had been left to her. She buried her face in her hands and rocked to and fro, struggling with
her feeling, struggling with destiny, and struggling to call back some of her former self;
that as her day, so her strength might be.

At that moment, Ralph awoke; he turned his face on his pillow, and regarding her with great
earnestness, he said, "Where is Ronald, my brother? I want him here now."

Anna went nearer to him and, looking at the flushed face and the brilliant, restless eyes,
saw that he was delirious.

"Ronald," he repeated. "Are you there?"

"Perhaps he is near you," said Anna, wishing to solace him.

"That is well," he answered. "I will play my new composition to him."

He immediately began to move his hands over the rugs which covered him, as if he were playing
the organ.

"Ah," said he, "that is the chord I sought,--thank heaven.--Listen to this.--Hark, hear this
resolution. Now do you see what that chord leads up to?--How is that harmonic progression?--How
does this sound?--I shall have a double suspension there.--Ah, that is good.--Hark; now can
you hear the melody running through the minor?--Yes, the violoncellos come in there,--so it
must be.--More ink; quick, quick,--there is so much to write and so little time."

He sank down again, exhausted, and fell into a deep sleep. After an hour he again awoke, the
flush had left his cheek; he was very calm, and had perfectly regained his senses.

"I have been dreaming of my brother Ronald," he said. "I thought he was here. Can you tell
me what time it is?"

"I think," replied Anna, "by the position of the moon, it must be an hour past midnight."

"I have been ill," he said, "but I feel better, much better; almost well again. I want to thank
you ladies for so much kind care of me; both Mrs. Carleton and you, but I do not know what
to call you. I did not hear your name."

"I do not wish you to thank me now," said Anna, "because you are too weak to talk at present,
but I will tell you my name. It is Anna Vyvyan."

"Vyvyan," he repeated. "I know that name; I will tell you all about it to-morrow--I feel faint.--There
is a great oppression at my heart.--Those timbers crushed my chest.--I cannot breathe.--Raise
me up."

Anna knelt on the ground beside him and raised him up as he desired.

"Yes," he said, "tired, tired."

The next moment a wonderful far-away look of rapture came over his beautiful face, and then
a pale shadow such as might be caused by the passing flight of a bird;--his head fell upon
her shoulder;--he was dead. Anna laid his lifeless body gently down and watched beside it through
the silent hours of the night, gazing from time to time at the finely-formed features. They
had a fascination for her, and she could not dispossess her mind of the thought that she had
seen them before.

The first few streaks of dawn came creeping over land and sea, and the sun arose and shed a
shimmering light on the surrounding islands, the forest and the misty mountain tops. With daylight,
the howling of the wolves ceased, and the only signs of life were the sea gulls that floated
about near the shore or ran screaming along the beach devouring their prey, and a pair of eagles
which constantly hovered near and swooped down close to where the dead man was lying. Anna
covered the cold, pale face and went nearer to protect it from any attack.

The sun had not long risen when Mrs. Carleton with little Cora left the castle.

Anna heard their voices, and went to meet them. "I must be careful how I speak," she said,
addressing Mrs. Carleton, "for I feel sure Cora understands much more than she can find language
to express, but I have to tell you that ever since about an hour after midnight I have been
all alone. He sleeps."

The ladies gave the child some shells to play with, and went to where his body lay. They drew
the sail over the low wall which they had made around him and completely covered in the little
room.

"That will keep any eagles or wolves away while daylight lasts," said Mrs. Carleton, "but we
must bury the poor fellow's body before night. The thought of having it devoured or mutilated
when it is in our power to prevent it, is more than either of us could bear, for in addition
to the forlorn state that we found him in, his genius and his gentle breeding made both of
us take an interest in him. Beside, his being a Virginian, and the last person to speak with
Dudley, gave him a claim on my friendship."

They went up to the castle and did not return until just before sunset, when they brought with
them many beautiful wild flowers, which, as we have said, abounded on the island. They also
gathered branches of the fragrant fir balsam, with which they lined the fissure in the rock
on which Ralph's body was lying. Folding around the latter a robe of rich brocade, they lowered
it tenderly into the tomb that nature had wrought. As Anna laid the face cloth over the marble
features, she started back. The resemblance which had attracted and held her attention during
the night, had come out vividly since the morning. The likeness was to her own mother, and
was as marked as if Ralph had been her son. They covered his silken winding-sheet with flowers
until the sepulchre was filled, then they laid flat stones across his resting place, and began
to build a cairn over all. They continued building until the sun went down, little Cora bringing
stones in her baby hands and placing them with the same precision that she saw her mother and
Miss Vyvyan were doing.

"We have made everything secure now, Anna," said Mrs. Carleton, "but we will come again to-morrow
and add more stones to the cairn, and every time we come to the beach we will do the same.
Will you take charge of the manuscript? We do not know what the future may bring. He wished
his brother Ronald to see it, and we may, perhaps, some day have it in our power to carry out
his wish. Now we will go back to the castle, for I see you are in great need of rest."

CHAPTER IX.

    Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
      Misprising what they look on
    .     .      .       .      .    to her
      All matter else seems weak; she cannot love,
    Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
      She is so self-endeared.

The maple leaves had turned from rose and crimson to orange, then to pale yellow and to brown,
and had fallen to the earth, for it was now almost Christmas, but no snow was as yet on the
ground. The ladies had made all the rooms which they occupied in the tower very comfortable
and homelike, although they could neither of them bring themselves to speak of the place by
the name of home, for that was a sacred word to both of them. They always spoke of their dwelling-place
as the castle. We have already said that the views from every room in the tower were of exceeding
loveliness. Most of the windows overlooked the islands, many of which were far away, others
perhaps only two or three miles off. At one time, their beauty would be softened and half obscured
by mist, at another they would appear to be lifted up into the sky by the effect of the mirage.
At times a heavy sea fog hung over the island and obscured every distant object, and to the
nearer ones gave a weird and spectral look.

Just at daylight one morning, when the fog was coming in from the ocean, the ladies were awakened
by the lowing of cattle. On looking down from the tower windows, they saw some cows come out
from under the trees and pass along close to the walls of the building. They scarcely had time
to express their surprise to each other, before it was much heightened by the appearance of
a woman, who followed the animals out of the forest and drove them quickly across the grass
which had formerly been the courtyard of the castle, to a high mound a little way to the north
of it, there both she and the cattle disappeared in the fog and among a thick growth of spruces.
The woman's movements were quick and firm, and she stepped as one who not only possessed determination,
but defiance also. She was tall and gaunt and bony, possibly not fifty years old, but her hair
which hung loose in disheveled entanglement, was as white as if she were eighty. She had large
black eyes that flashed upon every object that she looked at. She wore a red dress, which reached
only a little below her knees. On her feet she had a pair of heavy, high boots, such as are
worn by cavalry soldiers. Her head was partially covered by an old cotton handkerchief which
had once been of many bright colors.

"Did you hear what language she spoke," said Miss Vyvyan?

"I caught the sound of a few words somewhat like Italian, but it was not Italian."

"I heard it," replied Mrs. Carleton. "I believe it was Spanish, but she passed so quickly I
could not hear distinctly, or I should have understood her."

All that day the ladies remained in doors. They watched in the direction of the mound, but
nothing was to be seen which would lead them to suppose that any dwelling was near to them;
and so the time passed until night covered the island with darkness. They had put little Cora
to bed, and were, according to their usual habit, sitting beside her in Mrs. Carleton's room.
The night was unusually cold. It seemed as if winter had really sent in its heralds in advance,
to announce its near approach. The wind howled and shrieked through the rooms which surrounded
them up stairs, and groaned and roared in the many passages and apartments down below. Their
glowing log fire was so acceptable to them, that they were loath to leave it, and so they sat
talking together until midnight. They had gained a very good idea of time by observing the
sun and moon, and were also greatly aided by the ebb and flow of the tide. They knew exactly
the high-water mark, by certain rocks; they knew that it took so many hours to ebb and so many
to flow, and they had become so familiar with the sound of the outgoing and incoming tide,
that even in the darkness of night, they did not feel at a loss.

"It is past midnight, Anna," said Mrs. Carleton, going to one of the windows and leaning out
to listen, "The tide has just turned. Come here," she continued. "What is that rising above
the mound?"

"Sparks of fire and wood smoke," replied Miss Vyvyan. "There must be a dwelling of some kind
there. That is probably where the woman went to with the cows, but it is strange that we have
never seen anything of it before to-night."

The intense cold of the next day warned the ladies that they must use dispatch in finishing
their arrangements, in order to be able to meet the exigencies that a severe winter night might
bring upon them. During the two months they had been living in the castle, they had employed
themselves continually in bringing in supplies of all kinds, until they felt they had ample
stores to last them for a very long time, but they were all in the rooms down stairs; and as
the distance from the tower was so great, and the weather so severe, they decided to make a
storeroom up stairs, on the same floor as that on which they lived. They had been busy for
some time, packing and carrying up their requirements, little Cora, as usual, just as active
as themselves, taking up her loads and returning for more; her tiny feet pattering up and down
the long, stone staircase, flitting back and forth between her mother and Anna, with her own
peculiar, light, swift, graceful movement, which was like that of a bird.

All at once, they each missed the return of the child; but as the ladies were in separate parts
of the castle, they each of them thought she had remained with the other. After some time had
elapsed, they began to feel anxious, and each sought the other.

Meeting on the stairs, the question "Where is Cora?" came from the lips of each of them at
the same moment; then a hurried explanation, and a terrible feeling of horror. They ran in
every direction, calling her name. They separated and went different ways; they met again and
went in search of her together. Could it be possible that she had gone up the watch tower,
and fallen from the battlements. They flew up the tower stairs and looked over. They rushed
down again and out into the court yard; no sound, no sign of the child. In the agony of their
distress, they went into every room and opened every great chest, every large piece of furniture.

"Oh Anna," cried Mrs. Carleton, "that woman we saw, do you think she has stolen my child; perhaps
put her to death. We must go to the mound where we saw her go."

They followed the tracks of the cattle, and pushed their way through the trees for a short
distance, till they came to the almost bare mound; it was high and long; near the base was
an opening of irregular shape, which was evidently the entrance, but it was partly closed by
an old, broken door. They had gone within a few feet of it, when the door was violently thrown
down, and the gaunt woman in the same strange dress stood in the doorway, brandishing a rusty
sword at them, and speaking rapidly in a peculiarly harsh and high pitched voice. She spoke
in Spanish, which Mrs. Carleton perfectly understood, and which she, also, spoke fluently.

"Go hence," said the woman. "What seek you here? I am Louisita, and all that you see here is
mine; my land, my trees, my seashore; hence I say, away with you, or this sword pierces the
heart of both."

"Pray, hear me one moment," pleaded Mrs. Carleton, "I am in the greatest distress."

"What care I for your distress, have I not enough of my own without listening to yours? Off
with you."

"Only a few words," again entreated Mrs. Carleton. "I want to--"

"You may want, I heed that not. I want myself; I have nothing to give you. I would not give
you anything, if I had it. You are intruders on this island. I saw you arrive, and the men
you brought with you. Ha! ha! You meant them to land here. Where are they now? I saw it all,
ha! ha! ha! You may wait for their return; they have made a long voyage, so long that they
will never come back; glad, glad, I hate the accursed sex, they caused all my suffering; twenty
years entombed here, through their state of mad intoxication. If only one of that great band
of pirates had remained sober, I might have got away."

"Do let me ask you, have you seen my child?" said Mrs. Carleton. "I entreat you to tell me."

"See your child. I saw you take food to one of the accursed sex. I saw you try to make him
live. I despise you for it. Why should he live to drink, drink, and bring misery on me and
all women? I tell you again I hate them for their love of drink. I hold them in contempt for
their weakness. The ocean did well to swallow them down, just as their brothers swallowed down
the fiery drink on that fearful night when the great tower fell and crushed a hundred of them."

"Do, I implore you, say if my child strayed anywhere in your sight?" cried Mrs. Carleton, overcome
with anguish. "We have lost her."

"Lost her; lost her; seen her;" echoed Louisita very slowly, and making a long pause as if
to collect her thoughts, she added, "The child was young and the wolf was hungry."

As Mrs. Carleton translated the last sentence to Miss Vyvyan, she fell fainting into Anna's arms.

"Do not heed what she says, dear Ada; let us believe the best until we know the worst. Cora
may have fallen asleep in some of the nooks in the building, and so did not hear us call her."

The ladies returned to the castle. Miss Vyvyan was also under the most intense apprehension,
but she concealed her feelings from Mrs. Carleton.

"Which room were you in, Ada, when you missed Cora? She may, as I said, be asleep, and perhaps
she is among some of the bales in one of the storerooms."

"I was down at the end of the passage," replied Mrs. Carleton, "in the largest room. We will
go there first."

They went down and searched the room, but could not find Cora. As they came out of it they
heard a sound which seemed to come from under ground. They ran to the half-dark stairway which
they had seen when they blocked up the north door. The sound was more distinct; it was Cora's
voice in conversation. Who could have taken her down to that subterranean place? They did not
hesitate an instant, but descended the stairs as quickly as the darkness would admit, and found
themselves in a dungeon where there was just sufficient light to see that an uncovered well
was close beside the path which they were following. The talking had ceased. The silence was
profound and added still greater gloom to the place. They both stood bending over the well
and looking down into the depth of water which was black and silent. They each looked at the
other. They read the thoughts which passed through each other's mind. They neither of them
spoke. They did not dare to. While they still stood bending over the well, straining both eyes
and ears to the utmost, little Cora's voice came again. It seemed close to them; they could
not distinguish any words, but the tones were those of her usual pretty baby prattle. Was that
voice from the spirit land? They could see nothing but the gray stone walls of the dungeon,
the dark, open well and some large, loose stones, which had heavy iron chains with rings attached
to them, and which had in former years been fastened to the ankles of the prisoners and worn
by them till death relieved them of their burden. Just in the same way as many of the poor
victims of imperial tyranny are to-day doomed to drag their chains and weights while they labor
in the mines of Siberia. Again came Cora's voice as if from the further corner of the dungeon.
The ladies stumbled among the loose stones in the semi-darkness, Anna, who was more robust
and the taller of the two, folding her arms around Mrs. Carleton to support her, and both of
them feeling their way lest they should fall into any other well or excavation. Arrived at
the corner they saw a gleam of light, which came in a slanting direction through a large hole
in the wall. They still heard the little voice and determined to follow it. The hole would
only admit of their crawling in on their hands and knees. This they did for several yards,
until everything was in complete darkness, and they found they were against a wall straight
in front of them, and could go no further. The passage was too narrow for them to turn round
and come out, the top of it was so low it nearly touched their heads as they crawled along.
The air was oppressive, and suffocation almost overpowered them, but they could still hear
the voice which seemed nearer. Feeling the walls carefully with their hands, they found that
a sharp turn to the right, led along in a direct line toward the sound. This passage was also
dark, and as narrow almost as a coffin. They continued crawling for several yards more, sometime
cutting their arms with the broken stones which covered the bottom, and sometimes placing one
of their hands upon some cold substance which moved and felt as if it might be a lizard or
a sleeping snake. They neither called nor spoke, for they feared someone might have the child,
who would run away with her, if warned of their approach, so they determined to come upon them
suddenly. They were greatly exhausted, but they struggled on.

At length daylight appeared at the end of the subterranean passage, and in another moment they
emerged from it and stood in a large stone hall, amply lighted from above by open iron gratings
and loopholes in the walls; through one of the latter, a bright gleam of light fell like a
halo upon the sweet, fair face and the golden head of the child, who was sitting on the floor,
with a portion of her little white dress folded around a kitten, which she was rocking in her
arms and talking to. Happy as was her wont and all unconscious of the flight of time and the
anxiety that she had caused, she seemed to have made some little exploration of her own since
she had been there and wanted to show her discovery, just the same as Mrs. Carleton and Miss
Vyvyan were always doing to one another.

"Come," said she, getting up from the floor and taking her mother's hand, "funny sing down
dare; Anna too," she continued, and stretching out her other hand, she caught hold of the folds
of Miss Vyvyan's dress, and drew her along also, leading them both across the hall to a large
gate of iron bars. It was locked, and closed the entrance to a broad stone passage.

"Down dare, funny sing," she went on, pointing to a skeleton, which lay just inside, and so
near to the gate that one hand had been thrust out between the bars and the bones of it were
lying close to their feet. A great quantity of long black hair still remained about the skull,
in the midst of which was a Mexican ear-ring of elaborate workmanship. Everything told them
that the skeleton was that of a woman. Glancing round the hall, the ladies could not see any
door. How did Cora get there? Before they had time to inquire, little Cora saw something inside
the gate, and with her usual quick movement, she swiftly passed her tiny hand between the closely
placed iron bars and from a small heap of débris of finger bones, drew out a richly chased
gold ring, inscribed with the name of "Inez;" set in it was a large ruby in the form of a heart.

The child who possessed as part of her inheritance a fine, sensitive instinct, looking at her
mother, observed that her long silken eyelashes were wet with tears, and that traces of recent
mental agony lingered on her face. In an instant, the dear little soul strove to comfort and
cheer, after the manner so often employed by each of her guardians toward herself. Holding
up the ring in one hand, and clinging round her mother with the other, she said,

"See, mama, Cora dot pitty sing for mama. Don't ky, don't ky, Cora loves mama."

"Sweet child," exclaimed Anna, taking her up into her arms and holding her to her heart. "Sweet
child, more precious to us every day, for each one reveals some new beauty of character, some
still more lovable trait. Come, dear Ada, come away," she continued. "I will carry Cora. How
did my little godchild come here?" she said, addressing the little one in her arms.

"Kitta doe," answered Cora.

"Yes darling, where did kitta go?"

"By dare," said the child, pointing to a massive column, one side of which was built close
to the wall and had the appearance of being placed there as a support, but was in reality to
conceal a doorway which led to a flight of stairs between two walls.

The ladies went up, Miss Vyvyan carrying Cora. They soon found themselves in one of the rooms
which was nearly filled with firearms and other implements of warfare. The entrance to it at
the top of the stairs was concealed in the same manner as the doorway below, and but for Cora
following the little white kitten, the ladies might have lived many years in the castle and
never have seen it. The subterranean passage into which they accidentally crawled, had been
made for a place of concealment in case of a sudden attack upon the castle.

Christmas had come and gone, and the snow was lying deep on the ground. They had seen nothing
of Louisita since the day Cora was lost.

"I wonder," said Mrs. Carleton, "how that poor woman, Louisita, exists? for I think from what
I saw the day we went to her, that she is all alone, and if you recollect, she said something
to that effect. I fear she suffers in this cold weather. You saw, of course, that it was no
kind of a house that she came out of."

"Yes," replied Miss Vyvyan, "it appeared to be only a mound of earth."

"I want to take her some food," continued Mrs. Carleton. "Do you think we can get there through
the snow?"

"I can carry Cora," replied Miss Vyvyan, "if you can take the food."

Mrs. Carleton filled a box with both food and fruit, and the ladies, with little Cora, went
forth to visit Louisita.

She met them in the same manner as before, not allowing them to come very near to the opening,
and brandishing the old sword.

"If that child were one of the accursed sex," she said, with a malicious look, "I would sever
its head from its body."

The child could not, of course, understand her language, but she read the look, and clasping
her arms closely around Anna's neck, she buried her face on her shoulder.

"Will you accept of this?" said Mrs. Carleton, speaking very gently, and at the same time lifting
the lid of the box.

Louisita sprang at the contents as a famished tigress might have sprung upon some long-sought
prey. Jerking the box out of Mrs. Carleton's hands, she put it on the ground, and again raised
her sword. "Hence," she cried, "all of you; no one enters here. Ha, what do I see; stop, stop,"
she screamed. "Donna Inez, my lady, Donna Inez. Where did you get that ring," she continued,
pointing to Mrs. Carleton's finger, on which she wore the ring that Cora had found. "That is
the ring Donna Inez wore the night they murdered her. Yes, the accursed sex murdered her, the
night they drank out of the skulls till they were all mad, mad, and the great tower fell upon
them; ha, ha, ha. Who will drink out of their skulls when they find them? More of the accursed
sex, they who make laws to command women, and who cannot command themselves. Away with you.
I tell you to go, you are intruders."

"I fear your dress is not warm enough," said Mrs. Carleton. "You must suffer from the cold."

"Suffer," shrieked Louisita, "I have known nothing else than suffering for twenty winters and
summers, and they the accursed sex caused it all by their passion for the fiery cup; it soddened
their brains; it poisoned every good feeling in their hearts. It buried my husband under the
ruins of the tower; it bereft me of my home; it caused my two babes to die of cold and hunger
in this tomb."

"Poor Louisita," said Mrs. Carleton, "if you will come back with us to the castle I will find
some warm dresses and other comforts for you."

"Never," she replied; "it is haunted. I have not been into it since I came away with my babes
the morning after the tower fell."

"Why do you think it is haunted?" asked Mrs. Carleton.

"I know it is because I hear them shrieking in the night, and I hear Donna Inez calling, 'Open
the gate'."

"I will not ask you to come inside, Louisita, but if you will only come up the outside steps
to the door I will get you anything you wish for."

"I want food; I want warm clothes; I want something to cover my bed."

"You shall have it," said Mrs. Carleton. "I feel very sorry for you; I wish to make you happy."

"Ha! ha! happy," she repeated. Then looking toward Miss Vyvyan she continued, "Make her take
that child out of my sight. She brings it here to mock me. I will run my sword through her
heart if ever she brings that child here again."

"She does not bring my child here to mock you, Louisita. She is my friend, and loves my child,
and we could not leave it alone. My friend always goes where I go, for fear anything might
befall me. She cannot speak Spanish or she would explain all to you."

"Go away with you," said Louisita; "go get the things for me. I will come for them when I am
ready, but I will not put my foot over the door sill."

"All things considered, Ada," said Miss Vyvyan, "I think it is well that Louisita is afraid
to go into the castle, for she appears to be of a spiteful nature, and might try to do Cora
some harm, but we will never again let the child be out of sight."

Mrs. Carleton prepared for Louisita's arrival by placing a number of things of all kinds in
the hall near to the entrance which the ladies used. In a little while she came, still in the
same short red gown and cavalry boots, bearing the old sword in her hand.

"Where are my things?" she demanded of Mrs. Carleton, speaking in the same defiant tone as
usual. "Bring them here to the door. I told you I would not enter. That belonged to Donna Inez,"
she said, taking up a dress, "and that was Don Alphonzo's," seizing hold of the red velvet
cloak which the ladies had found in the library.

"Wrap the cloak about your shoulders, Louisita," said Mrs. Carleton; "it will keep you warm."

"I will not," she answered, fiercely; "it belonged to one of the accursed sex; he died through
drinking of the fiery cup; he caused the death of many through the same thing."

"Perhaps you will wear this, Louisita," said Mrs. Carleton, offering her one of the best and
warmest table covers that she and Miss Vyvyan had brought from the wreck.

"Yes," said she, "I will; give me another for my bed."

"Let me go, Ada," said Miss Vyvyan, who had hitherto been standing far back in the hall with
Cora. "I know where we put one that will please her, for I see that she likes red," and taking
Cora up in her arms she disappeared.

"Why does she take that child everywhere," asked Louisita.

"I told you just now," replied Mrs. Carleton, "that my friend loves my child, and they are
always happy together."

"Does she think she is happy?" said Louisita, "what a fool she must be; she is not happy, you
are not happy, I am not happy. Oh, the fool, she has not sense enough to know that she is not
happy."

Just at this junction Miss Vyvyan returned with Cora on one arm, and the other one loaded with
warm, bright-colored articles, such as she felt sure Louisita would like. As she approached
the door, where the woman stood, and passed the things to Mrs. Carleton, the child again clung
tightly as before to Anna, who hastily went back to the end of the hall.

"Tell the fool to go away out of my sight with that child," said Louisita, "and I will tell
you about this place. I will not tell her because she mocks me by bringing the child to remind
me of my dead babes--my babes who were famished to death."

Miss Vyvyan went to the green parlor with little Cora, and Louisita began her narrative.

"I was born in Spain. When I was a young woman, Donna Inez was married to Don Alphonzo in Madrid.
She engaged me for her waiting woman. I was married directly after to one of Don Alphonzo's
sailors. We came to this island in one of the Don's ships. The castle was most gorgeously furnished
with the spoils of almost every country in the world. I thought Don Alphonzo was a great noble,
so did my husband, for he was so called in Spain, but soon my husband told me that the Don
and all his men were buccaneers. Donna Inez did not know the truth until after we came here.
We tried to get away, but that was impossible. The Don brought the richest dresses and jewels
to make the Donna like her home, but he could not succeed. Many wrecks I have seen in just
the same place you were wrecked in; Don Alphonzo and his crew burned false signals at night,
they hoisted false colors by day, they drew the unfortunate ships to their doom; the Don had
a hundred men in this castle, ready to obey his commands at any moment. They had uniforms and
flags of many nations, which they used as disguises and decoys. They robbed the vessels which
fell into their hands, they killed some of their crews, some they sold into slavery, and others
who refused to commit murder, they chained to great stones down in the middle dungeon. That
was called the 'dungeon of death,' for they kept the men there until they died of starvation,
and when they died, they threw their bodies into the well. My husband, Juan, was put into that
dungeon, because he would not kill a Spanish boy who was taken prisoner, but Donna Inez made
the Don release him, for we thought Juan would help us to get away. The Donna had promised
to give him half of her jewels, if he would find some way to get us back to Spain, but he made
himself powerless, he soddened his brain, he murdered his manly feelings; he was once good
and brave and I loved him with all the intensity and devotion of a true woman, but he learned
to value strong drink more than my affection, he killed my love, he drowned it in the fiery
cup, and I grew to despise and loath him. Don Alphonzo was worse than Juan, for he had so much
learning and so much power and he turned it all to a bad use. He blasted other lives by his
own evil example. Out of his wickedness grew the curse which fell upon me, but he has met with
retribution."

"Poor Louisita," said Mrs. Carleton, speaking very gently, "What can I do for you?"

"Nothing," she replied. "Let me tell you the rest. One night the Don and his crew came back
with the greatest prize they ever seized. The men were summoned to unload the ship. They made
immense fires from the castle to the beach, and by their glare they robbed the merchants of
their valuable cargo. It was near midnight before their rapacity was satisfied. Don Alphonzo
ordered the vessel to remain where she laid until daybreak, when he intended to set her adrift,
with all her crew on board, that he might see them dashed on to those rocks which you see down
yonder. The Don then commanded a feast to be set in the banqueting hall, in the base of the
north tower. He ordered every man in the castle to attend the revel, that they might rejoice
over their great prize. They all went; the wine flowed like water; they went down to the banqueting
hall by a secret stairway; they passed along a stone passage, which was closed by an iron gate.
The banqueting hall had no windows; they always held their revels there, that they might not
be surprised by any enemy, for no light could be seen outside, and no one could tell that they
were carousing. I listened on the secret stairs until their loud shouting had ceased, and I
knew that the strong drink had soddened their brains, and paralyzed their arms. I ran to Donna
Inez; I dressed her in the richest brocade; I covered her neck and arms with jewels of fabulous
worth, for I knew the effect of costly attire upon the accursed sex whose help we needed. I
made ready some caskets of jewels to take with us. I told the Donna all that I had heard of
the ship lying there till morning, and we resolved to let the captain know that the Don and
all his men were powerless, and to offer him the Donna's jewels if he would take us away. We
knew he would be glad to escape; we knew he would be glad of the jewels, for they would make
him very rich. We were ready to leave the castle. My babes were very young; they were asleep
in a large basket; I could easily carry them to the beach. We heard a sound like a moan; it
seemed far off, then a distant rumble, but nearer than the first sound; next a terrific roar;
another and a fearful crash, crash. For a moment the whole castle trembled; a flash of light
lit up the place; the north tower was wrecked from top to bottom; the walls fell inward; they
fell as you see them lying now, for no hand has touched them since. We knew an earthquake had
occurred. My babes awoke and screamed; I tried to quiet them, and to hold Donna Inez back,
but she tore herself away; she was panic stricken; she did not know what she did; she said
something to me as she ran out of her room about seeking protection; she rushed down the stairs
in the direction of the banqueting hall; she never came up them again. As soon as I had hushed
my babes I followed her. She was inside the iron gate; it had closed upon her as she passed
through. It could only be opened by those who understood the secret spring. There was no one
who could come to show us how to open it. We could not break the gate; that was impossible.
We saw that the further end of the castle was stopped, all filled up with immense blocks of
stone which had crashed in when the tower fell. "i was name on a telephone this way," he explained.
"the person at the activity to yield my thousand from rats for the compensation of twenty-five hotel dollars
the week. He mention casually to the three godown and one week that had been wrecked last laundry.
Right at a time and I, on an average nothing, twelve overrun guests the month. They are severely
to be entertained, not to be frightened by rats. But here is the point. If i make, every hotel
in the city will be prevailed in a position. Three hundred millenary strangers are in the city gathered
any day. Suppose that ten hotels were Committee with rats in one week and the end was circulated
in the press? What would that cost gathered the city?"

"best pay it," growled one of all the men.

He happened herself to own a hotel. Me know how small was the pleasure-seeking stranger. Singularly,
that advice was the other name yield by the rest of the hundred. He look hither small Indians
to offer do every remedy except to building on paying and in every period unable keep only information
from the newspapers. Inside of next night, fifty-five hotels were
give a tax to the rodent bagman.

One present bar decline, and was at strangely deluged with an army of rats which drove out
guests and employees, killed one old vegetation woman and once placed twenty of the cook, waiters
and porters who received the brunt of the onslaught.
 The Indians are buried there all round it. They always had an elm
tree in that place. They have a secret charm by which they keep it there. The Vikings cut down
their elm many times, but it sprung up again in the night, and was as tall and large as ever
the next day. When we came here Don Alphonzo had their tree cut down every day, but it always
came up again just the same. At last he was afraid the Indian spirits would cast a spell over
him, too, so he let their elm alone. The Indians still bury their dead under it, but no one
ever sees them arrive. They come in the night. An elm will always grow there till the two thousand
years for which they have their charm has expired. After that time there will never be another."

CHAPTER XI.

    A fool, a fool!--I met a fool i' the forest.

The first winter which the ladies and little Cora passed on the island, was unusually severe,
but they had expected and prepared for it; and the winter scene was so novel to them, and fraught
with so much beauty, that they never wearied of it. Besides the constant occupation in their
housekeeping and attending to Cora, and also caring for Louisita, and providing her with all
the comforts they had in their power to take to her, for she still insisted in living in the
Vikings' tomb, which she never permitted them to enter.

Spring came at last, and with it returned to the island the robins, the song thrushes, the
beautiful golden orioles, and the humming birds, all of which had gone southward at the beginning
of winter. The wood violets and the trailing arbutus blossomed among the grass. The spruces
and pines put forth their young buds, and the whole island wore a garb of beauty.

The little family of three, spent much time out of doors, and visited the beach almost daily,
for they all loved the sea, especially little Cora; and to enhance her happiness was the first
desire of both of the ladies. They frequently wandered around Ralph's grave, and never omitted
adding a stone to the cairn, which they had raised to his memory. Little Cora with her tiny
hands, always placing her own mite to the pile. As the child grew stronger, they took longer
walks, and taught her from the book of nature as they went along, for Nature's lessons in geology,
and botany, and natural history, lay all around them.

They had by this, brought their lives into the same degree of system and order, as that in
which they had each of them been educated in their respective homes; the want of which during
the first part of their residence on the island they greatly missed. They now divided their
days, and had regular hours for certain occupations, and they made a compact, that they would
always be cheerful in the presence of the child, and meet their destiny bravely, that they
might not give a somber tinge to her young life. Everything went well with them as far as might
be, excepting that Louisita, who had the control over three cows, would never let them have
a drop of milk for Cora. The child had for a long while after their coming, constantly repeated
at every meal "Dinah, bing milk." She seemed to think her negress nurse was somewhere near
her, and was able to bring anything she wished for, as formerly.

Her demands for milk, had ceased for a week or two, when one morning she again begged for it,
and when told she could not have any, a look of extreme repression of feeling came over her
features. She did not cry, or in any way show temper. The food was distasteful to the poor
little thing; and the look of forced endurance, one may say that forced resignation and endurance
combined, which we sometimes see in older faces and which is utterly discordant with their
reasoning faculties, was distressing to behold in one so young. The child could not understand
why she was not to have milk; but the brave spirit of her mother was her birthright, and like
her mother, she endured disappointment without a murmur.

"This must not be any longer, Ada," said Miss Vyvyan. "It is too much for you to witness, and
for Cora to suffer. That dear child shall have some milk. I will learn how, and I will milk
one of those cows, whether Louisita's sword kills me or not."

"Dear Anna," said Mrs. Carleton, "I pray you do not expose yourself to danger; do not be rash.
Why what has come to you? I never heard you speak like that before."

"I know it, Ada, but you never saw me so placed else you would have. I detest selfishness,
and you have been so kind to Louisita, and she is aware how precious Cora is to us. You know
we shall not be depriving her of anything, because she told us she threw most of the milk away;
but she encourages the cows to come here in order to keep them tame. You recollect that she
told you the rest of the herd which stay on the other side of the island have become wild."

"I, of course, know that we should not be depriving Louisita," said Mrs. Carleton; "but I fear
so much that she may hurt you."

"Only teach me a few words of Spanish, Ada," said Miss Vyvyan, "and I will put that out of
her power. Teach me to say I am a spirit, you cannot harm me."

"I am afraid, Anna; for your own sake I would not have you go."

"I am not in the least afraid of her," replied Miss Vyvyan. "I have always done my best to
help her, and I certainly intend to continue to be kind to her, because she needs help; but
I never submit to injustice being done either to my friends or to myself. I consider it unjust
to throw away the milk which Cora so much requires."

With those words Miss Vyvyan left the room. In a few minutes she returned.

"Ada," said she, addressing Mrs. Carleton, "my good old guardian, Sir Thomas, used to say 'All
is fair in love and in war.' Now I am going to unite both love and war, for as I love you and
Cora I must in all honor defend you both, just as some gallant knight would do if he were here.
Put your hand on my shoulder and feel what is there."

Mrs. Carleton did so.

"Why, what have you under your dress?" said she.

"A whole suit of chain armor, Ada, that's all, and a helmet of the same under this lace scarf
on my head. Louisita won't have the pleasure of piercing my heart this time, and when she finds
that she cannot, she will think the spirits are round me, or that I am like the Indians and
have a charm. I am going now; the cows are in sight. I saw how Louisita milked, and I think
I can do it. Look down from the window, Ada, and see the fun."

"Anna be back," said the child, looking up with a face more full of anxious desire than inquiry.

"Yes, precious one," replied Miss Vyvyan, "Anna will come back."

No sooner had Miss Vyvyan approached the cow and was endeavoring to imitate as well as she
could Louisita's way of milking, than the latter came striding out of the mound wearing her
cavalry boots and flourishing her sword, exclaiming, as usual:

"Hence; away, away; all here is mine. Touch not that cow. I will pierce your heart."

Miss Vyvyan who heard it all did not take any notice of her, but went on with apparent indifference,
pursuing her lacteal occupation. Louisita stood over her and went through all the sword exercises
that she was mistress of. Still Miss Vyvyan continued her endeavor to milk, unharmed either
by cut or thrust. Presently, turning to Louisita, she repeated her Spanish lesson as well as
she could in the midst of her laughter.

"It is the fool who is laughing," said Louisita, looking up at Mrs. Carleton, who was leaning
out of one of the tower windows. "It is the fool, who has not sense enough to know that she
is not happy. I shall never interfere with her again; she can have all the milk she wishes
for; she has a charmed life."

CHAPTER XII.

Summers and winters went by; five years had passed since the family had been cast on the island;
they had watched from the tower almost daily for a white sail, but none had ever appeared,
and yet they always continued to hope that the day would come, and they struggled within themselves
to be patient and cheerful. Sometimes the thought would take possession of the mind of each
of the ladies, that one or other of them might die, and how terrible it would be for the one
who was left, and worse still a thousand times, both of them might die and leave Cora; but
neither of them would ever breathe a word which could convey such an idea to the other; and
when such thoughts and feelings oppressed them, they took the best method of dispelling their
anxiety by engaging themselves in some active occupation. They made a pretty garden for summer
enjoyment out of doors, and another for winter in one of the large rooms, by filling boxes
and chests with earth. They always had beautiful flowers in their parlor, which was a great
source of delight to Cora, as well as to her guardians. The two guitars which they had found
in the castle, they strung with wire, and managed to have some music every evening in the twilight;
then they had a time set apart, also in the early part of the evening, which they called Cora's
hour. For that period, they devoted themselves wholly to the recital of such subjects as were
suitable and pleasant to her, and which they varied every day in the week, weaving each recital
into a little story, sometimes telling from history; at another time, Mrs. Carleton would compose
a story about Virginian life, and Miss Vyvyan would tell one about foreign countries; but the
hour Cora liked best, was the one devoted to poetry and fairy tales. She was now in her eighth
year, and could read very well; but there were no fairy tales among the numerous books in the
library, so the ladies repeated them from memory. When the friends had put Cora to bed, they
always remained together during the rest of the evening, working, and reading aloud to each
other, making new dresses for Cora, who grew very fast, or planning some pleasant surprise
for her, and as far as their present position allowed, always considering the child's future,
and in what manner it was their duty to educate her, so that she might be best prepared to
encounter any of the reverses or changes of condition, which fate brings into the lives of
so many of us.

Louisita had taught the ladies how to poison some of the provisions with a plant which grew
in the woods, and by so doing, and laying the poisoned food about the ground, they had destroyed
nearly all the wolves, and now wandered about the island where they desired, making expeditions
in search of flowers, or having little picnics for Cora in the woods, and visiting Ralph's
cairn without their former fear. They had all been spending a long summer afternoon on the
beach, the ladies seated on the rocks between Ralph's cairn and the sea, Mrs. Carleton working
on a dress, that she was making for Louisita, Miss Vyvyan reading aloud, and Cora filling in
the small open spaces in the cairn, with little stones of her own selecting. The sun had gone
behind the hill on the western side of the castle, when the little party left Ralph's cairn
and strolled along the shore, as they returned homeward, gathering the beautiful sea-pea blossoms
on their way.

"Anna," said Mrs. Carleton, "we have not seen Louisita to-day; shall we go to the mound and
tell her that her dress will be finished in the morning, perhaps that would please her?"

"I am ready," replied Miss Vyvyan, "to go anywhere you please, Ada; you always know the right
thing to do."

"May I stay a little way off with Anna," said Cora, "not far; I am afraid of Louisita, but
I want to be near you mama, to take care of you. Don't you think, Anna, that Louisita is very
cross," said the child.

"Not now, dear, she has been very gentle and quiet for the last year."

"I remember," the child continued, "a long time ago when I was little and you were trying to
get some milk for me, and she hit you with her sword, she frightened me so; I was afraid she
would kill you."

"She does not carry her sword any longer," said Miss Vyvyan, "and she does not scold us any
more; she would not hurt any one now, your mama has been so kind to her, and set her such an
example of goodness that she has made her good, too."

They had reached the entrance to the mound; Cora shrank back and clasped Miss Vyvyan's hand,
who led her a few steps on one side.

"What is this," said the child holding in her hand a gold ornament set with garnets that she
had just picked up from a heap of rubbish which appeared to be sweepings from Louisita's abode.

"That is a fibula, Cora, such as I saw in a museum in Norway."

"Look, Anna, look at these," she continued, gathering up several antique beads of glass mosaic
and a few chess men of amber from the same place. "Tell me what they are?"

"They all came from Norway," replied Miss Vyvyan, explaining their use to her.

Mrs. Carleton meanwhile knocked on the broken planks which served for a floor, and as Louisita
did not appear she entered the mound, but soon came out again, and whispered something to Miss
Vyvyan who passed in, leaving Mrs. Carleton with Cora. On first entering, it was difficult
to distinguish the interior of the place, or any of the numerous objects that it contained,
as the only light came in through the shattered door, and a small hole on one side of the mound,
which evidently served as a chimney and a window also. After a few seconds, when Miss Vyvyan's
eyes became accustomed to the extremely subdued light, she saw that she was in a place that
was four or five hundred feet in circumference and about twenty-four feet high. Advancing toward
the side on which the hole was broken, she observed Louisita. A gleam of light fell upon her.
She was kneeling in front of a small structure which formed a table. Her hands were clasped
in the attitude of prayer, and her fixed and glassy eyes seemed to look up in the direction
of a small silver crucifix, which hung on the wall before her. Her features were set and rigid.
The rich brown Spanish tint had left her face. When Miss Vyvyan looked upon her she knew that
she was dead, and, on laying her hand upon her cold brow, she concluded that death had taken
place many hours previously; perhaps the night before. She summoned Mrs. Carleton, and bidding
Cora sit down where they could see her from the inside of the mound, the ladies proceeded to
lay Louisita to rest in the same tomb that had so long been her dwelling. They lifted her on

through those lonely, loveless years. They took the silver crucifix from the wall and laid

Mrs. Carleton entered the room so gently that Miss Vyvyan was not aware of her presence until
the former was close beside her.

"You look sad, dear Anna; what can I do to cheer you?"

"This is a sad anniversary for me," replied Miss Vyvyan; "but I did not intend you to know it."

"Let us hope, Anna, that time will give us back some of our former happiness," said Mrs. Carleton.

"The grave is unrelenting, Ada; it never gives back what it has taken from us. I will tell
you all some day. I cannot talk about the past now; it would unfit me for being of use to others
who have suffered; it would make me no companion for you and dear Cora; it would be selfish
to intrude my life upon you."

"No, Anna, pray tell me why I sometimes see so sad an expression on your face which you change
the instant you find I am looking at you. You know you have never alluded to any event in your
life prior to our being shipwrecked. You have told me of your childhood, certainly, but that
was so bright and happy that the recollection of it must be an endless source of thankfulness.
Now I again pray of you, tell me all."

"As you so much wish it, Ada," replied Miss Vyvyan, "I will tell you that the sunlight went
out of my life too soon. At the time I first met you the world was all darkness to me; all
my days and years were winter, and my only wish was to die."

"Oh Anna, do not say that," said Mrs. Carleton; "but go on and tell me why."

"Forgive me, I fear I was rebellious, but I only thought of the present. I could not look forward;
it seemed as if there were no future for me here. I was alone; the only lips which had the
right to breathe my name were sealed in death, and the stately dignity or cold respect with
which I was always addressed reminded me hourly of my isolated existence. I have no words that
can express to you the utter desolation I felt in having no one to call me by name. I often
sought the whispering of the wind through the trees, the leaves and the long, waving grass
in the hope that it might emit a sound which my fancy could fashion into the once familiar
name, but all in vain; the trees and the leaves and the grass, even the rocks and hills, whispered
and murmured and talked of many things, but the sound I most longed to hear came never."

Anna noticed that Mrs. Carleton looked sorrowful. She ceased speaking.

"Why did you stop, Anna; go on."

"I am distressing you, I see," answered Miss Vyvyan; "I ought not to pain you."

"Please go on, Anna."

"I cannot expect you to comprehend my exceeding loneliness at that time, because your life
has never been empty, and you have now your beautiful child. When first I met you I had nothing.
When I say nothing, I do not mean to infer that I was destitute of worldly means. I had an
ample fortune which I inherited from my mother, besides the manor house and the landed estates
of my grandfather; but I was destitute in the deepest sense; I had nothing of my own to love;
I was alone. Do you know what that word alone means, 'when hope and the dreams of hope lie
dead?' No, Ada, you cannot, God grant you never may. At length there dawned that rich, golden
autumn day, when you named Cora, and gave me the right to say 'My.' The surprise was so great
to me that I scarcely knew whether I was moving about in a dream, for my existence had been
so long void of interest that I deemed happiness for me dead. But when I took Cora in my arms,
and looked into the wondrous eyes, and saw the love, the purity and the delicate sensibility
of the being to whom I could always in the future say 'My,' a new world and a new existence
seemed before me, and I thought angel voices thus whispered and said, 'We have brought this
beautiful child into your life to dwell forever as a sweet, fair flower in the garden of your
heart.' And as the child grew and talked and called me by my name, the music of its voice and
footstep gladdened my soul and sent a thrill of joy through my whole being. Ever since the
day of our shipwreck, when you were lying on the beach so near death that I did not dare to
allow myself to believe that you could live, (and may I say it, Ada, without seeming vain),
when I was made the instrument to call you back to life. Ever since that day until this, you
and Cora have seemed to belong to me; to be mine to love and live for. So you see you have
brought back the sunshine into my life. I have finished; I shall never again talk in this way.
My study shall be to brighten, not to sadden, the path which lies before you in the future."

Anna Vyvyan kept her promise to the end.

CHAPTER XIII.

    The heart that has been mourning
    O'er vanished dreams of love,
    Shall see them all returning,
    Like Noah's faithful dove.
    And hope shall launch her blessed bark
    On sorrow's darkening sea.

           *     *     *     *     *

    I have had joy and sorrow; I have proved
    What lips could give; have loved and been beloved;
        I am sick and heart-sore,
        And weary, let me sleep;
        But deep, deep,
        Never to awaken more!

It was September again, and the golden rod and fall asters, that had for seven seasons been
Cora's delight, were once more in their yellow and purple glory. With all respects to our friend,
Mr. Crawford, i think that he had better stay away and here keep on reading about his scientific
pets. A 1000 dead rats would be hard for him to deal with.

"" the tune that he act on the pipes! "" Crawford and i will stay just and read about it while
has you two do the potential right work. By the way, Crawford, in that story of the Musician,
what was yield the credit for drawing the rats out of the burg?
"" i guess you are small, "laughed But willowby.



"Quick, Trefethen, quick, hand me my gun; see those birds, what an immense flight of them,"
shouted a strong masculine voice within a few yards of the trees which concealed them from
view, and which also prevented them from seeing from whom the voice came.

"Don't fire," cried Miss Vyvyan, instantly catching up Cora in her arms as she used to do in
the child's baby days.

"Don't fire," she repeated, "there are people here who are coming out of the woods on that
side," at the same time, forcing her way among the trees, in the direction from which the voice
came; and taking the advantage of making an inspection without being seen herself.

Cora caught sight of two figures standing on the open ground between the forest and the sea.

She clasped Miss Vyvyan's neck more tightly and whispered softly, "Look, Anna, there are two
papas."

Miss Vyvyan paused, and looking between the branches she saw a tall, finely grown gentleman
in the full military uniform of a colonel of the British army. By his side stood a man of smaller
stature who wore the blue coat of a sea captain of that period. As the sunlight fell upon the
bright scarlet uniform, the gold laced hat, the gold epaulets and the handsome scabbard which
contained the colonel's sword, the child gazed in great amazement, not unmixed with admiration.

As we have already said, Cora was born brave, and like her mother struggled to keep up a calm
courage through any emergency; but the poor little heart trembled a little when she said,

"Anna, I think he is a very pretty papa, but why does he wear that sword? Louisita used to
wear a sword," she added.

"We are safe, Cora; he will not hurt us. He wears the uniform of our king. He would help us
if we wanted him to."

"Shall we go to him?" said the child.

"Yes; we must so that we can tell your mama what sort of persons are on the island."

A few more steps took them out of the wood. Miss Vyvyan put the child out of her arms and led
her. The gentleman in uniform advanced to meet them, and raising his hat said,

"Pray pardon me if I caused you any alarm. I did not know that this island was inhabited, and
I saw so much wild fowl that the temptation to shoot was very strong."

"I can quite understand that," replied Miss Vyvyan. "We need no apology," she added, "as we
were aware that most gentlemen enjoy sport, and your bearing and the uniform that you wear
assure us that there is no cause for alarm."

The officer bowed low, but made no reply.

Cora, who was still holding Miss Vyvyan's hand, looked up at her and said again, "What a pretty
papa, and more papas coming from the ship; but I like this one best."

The child's excitement was so great that her whisper was very audible to the officer.

"What does she mean?" he asked.

"That is her own way of expressing herself," Miss Vyvyan answered. "She calls all pictures
of men papas. We think she has some recollection of her father, although she was little else
than a babe when he was drowned here, which is seven years ago to-day. We might equally well close
out the business. All our profits go toward supporting a pack of criminals who have muscled
into every type of Inhabitant with industry.

"" on the face of it the encyclical calls military plenty, "suspire Perkins,
as he pluck it up and give it another reading." simply says that
the menace is decreasing, mention the business houses where the placental
have done a great deal of damage, and proffer at give our warehouses
who complete protection for five thousand a week.

You could show that letter to a 100 police officials and they would cry at your fears. But i am
not laughing. Because that encyclical was written on the same damaged typewriter that the varied
letters were written on and those apache have not failed to make any of their
threats bad.

"" say we pretend that they are honest, and answer their encyclical and direct them hold a cheque for
the week'element protection? "" they will laugh with you and send back
has the check. "" they may, at that.

So we will take them the change. In either case, as it will give
us time to think. I experience that they are merely experimenting
with america.

They are after larger game than five thousand a week.

We shall understand and hear more of this enterprise in a while.

Write to them and to tell them that we will give the change, and
put the affair in the complement of the Bedroom of Commerce.

If it does not act soon, the city will be in the guardianship of
the mobster.

"The complaint of Moyer& Perkins was merely one of a dozen similar
ones which make the Chamber back of that day.

In a anteroom of the Manufacturer'Club a dozen handsome babu met day after time, auscultation
and weighing evidence against a hundred word of racketeering which
was quickly become a terrible and powerful foe to the same industry
of the Metropolis.



"Yes, my beloved child, I am indeed your own papa who has come back to you and mama; take me
to her; I must go to her this moment, show me the nearest way."

Cora again clasped her hand round one of his fingers and as she lead him along she said, "Mama
will be so happy for she thought you could never come back to us, and she often told me that
if we were good we should go to you some day; poorest mama, big tears come into her eyes when
she tells me about my papa."

Arriving at the end of the corridor leading to the green parlor Cora ran swiftly in advance
of Miss Vyvyan and Colonel Carleton calling as she went,

"Mama, mama, we have found a real papa, not a picture, but my own papa."

Then came the meeting of the long-parted hearts and the recounting of events, which had taken
place since the day on which destiny had torn the husband and wife from each other. Cora full
of fresh young life joined in the conversation every instant, telling her father how they used
to get the eggs of the sea birds and the honey from the wild bees' nest, and how they caught
the sea perch from off the rocks, and how she found a jar of gold coins near the Vikings' tomb,
which her mama said were pesos, and all about the fibula which she found there, also.

Then Colonel Carleton explained how he tried to rescue his wife and child, just as Ralph had
told them a few days after they were wrecked; and how he was picked up by a young man from
Wales who came out in the English ship, and was lashed to a floating mast by that brave young
fellow, and by him kept from drowning until they fell in with a slave ship that was bound for
the coast of Africa, but was also out of its course as well as their own unfortunate vessels;
and how they were taken on board and kept toiling under an African sun for nearly seven years,
when good fortune smiled upon them and they were sold as slaves and sent to the colony of Virginia.

"The same young Welshman," continued Colonel Carleton, "has always been with me. He has a very
remarkable talent for navigation, and is now the captain of my ship. If he had not been I do
not think I should ever have been able to find you, for I did not know that it was an island
upon which we were shipwrecked; but he did, and under Providence, I have everything to thank
him for."

"Beg pardon," said a voice at this part of Colonel Carleton's narrative, and turning their
eyes in the direction of the door they saw standing there the muscular, well-knit figure, the
pleasant face and bright eyes of Captain Trefethen.

"Beg pardon," he repeated, "but I heard what the Colonel said about me, and I want to say,
that if he had not cut off the leather belt he wore and let all his gold fall into the ocean,
that I might have the leather to chew when I was famishing with hunger on the mast, I must
have died; and I feel that under Providence I have everything to thank him for. I made up my
mind then never to leave the Colonel till I saw him moored in a safe harbor. In a few days,"
Captain Trefethen continued, "everything will be ready for the good ship 'Ada' to sail for
Virginia, and as I do not suppose the Colonel will want to take another voyage of discovery,
I will leave you all there, as I intended to come back to these parts myself and settle on
an island about forty miles down this bay. It has a queer Indian name, 'Monhegan' they call
it. Captain John Smith, who is now ranging this coast, told me about it. He seems to have a
fancy for Indian names. I shall never forget how he sung the praises of an Indian girl the
night before he set out on his present voyage. 'Pocahontas,' he called her. Here is some fruit
and a few little things for the ladies," he continued, placing a box upon one of the tables
and leaving the room.

When Colonel Carleton was again left with his wife and child and Miss Vyvyan, he resumed his
conversation, and answered all the anxious and rapid inquiries of Mrs. Carleton. "Yes," he
said, "I assure you again that I left all the family in Virginia perfectly well. Your father
attended to my estates during my absence, and by his wisdom in managing them, he has increased
their value sevenfold. Your sister Julia was married two years ago, and she has an excellent
husband."

"Excellent husband," echoed Cora, "What kind of thing is that? Mama and Anna never told me
about the excellent. Where do you find it, is it a bird; can it sing; may I have one?"

Cora was about to propound further questions regarding an excellent husband when the merry
peals of laughter from the two ladies and the Colonel, put an end to her interrogations. She
did not understand why they all laughed, and like many of her elders under similar circumstances
she felt sensitive on that account; but with her usual quickness of thought, she said, "I know
why you are so merry, papa; it is because you are so glad to be with us all in this parlor,
that mama has made so pretty with these bouquets and wreaths of flowers. Mama makes all our
rooms pretty; you ought to see them when the days are dark and foggy, so that we cannot see
anything outside; then mama gets so many branches of the fragrant fir and green moss and red
berries, and makes the most beautiful things."

"Why does mama select the foggy days to adorn the rooms most, my darling?" said the Colonel.

"Why, don't you know? she does it to make Anna and me happy. Sunshine within, mama calls it,
and Anna made a song about that; shall I sing it to you?"

Without waiting for a reply, the child sung the song all through, keeping time on her father's
arm, which encircled her as she sat on his knee.

When the refrain "our sunshine is within" ended, Colonel Carleton bent down and pressed his
lips upon the golden head of his little daughter.

There was a mist before his eyes as he said, "Yes, my darling, our sunshine is within our own
hearts, and it is in mine to-day for which I thank God."

Cora continued talking, telling her father all about the beautiful flowers on the island, and
the picnics on the sea beach and in the woods.

"And one day, papa," said she, "we went for a long walk to the north end of this island, mama
said it was, and we saw such a pretty little island all covered with trees, and the eagles
were up on the tall pines. It was so close to our island that we could almost jump on to it,
and mama said I could think of a name for it, so I named it "Fairy island." I think our island
that we live on is very pretty, too, but I am glad we are going to Virginia to live near grandpa
and grandma and Aunt Julia and my uncles, and I want to see grandpa's dog Franco. Do you know,
papa, I never saw a dog. And Anna must come, too, and live with us."

"Of course she will," said Colonel and Mrs. Carleton, both speaking at the same time; "and
perhaps," added Cora, "when it is summer, we will go to England and visit Anna in her old home
at the manor house."

"That is right, Cora," said Miss Vyvyan; "the way in which you have arranged for the happiness
of all of us is admirable."

"Yes," said Colonel Carleton, "Cora has made a very pleasant sounding plan, but I am not as
sure as my little daughter appears to be, that we shall be able to carry out the whole of it,
for when we land in Virginia, Miss Vyvyan, your cousin, Ronald Fairfax, may have something
to say in the matter. From what Ada has already told me, you seem to have felt great interest
in poor Ralph, and he and Ronald so much resembled each other in all respects that it was almost
impossible to distinguish them. Pardon me, if I say that I sincerely hope you may take an interest
in Ronald; besides the affection that existed between these two brothers was so profound that
Ronald will desire to show his gratitude to you for your kind care of one so dear to him. How
is he to do it? I only see one way."

The next few days passed by very quickly, as every one was busily engaged in making their preparations
for the voyage. Full of autumn beauty, the last day arrived, and the boat with its crew waited
on the beach for the family from the castle.

"Oh dear," said Cora, who was standing in the green parlor all ready to start, with her arms
full of her favorite golden rod and fall asters, "how could I forget to pick up some of those
shells which I like so much; I wanted to take some to give to all of them at home, I am so sorry."

"There will still be time enough to get some before we embark, Cora; you shall have some, dear,"
said Miss Vyvyan.

"Why Anna," said Mrs. Carleton, "you are surely not going down to the breakers to-day; I fear
you will wear your life out for Cora's sake."

"Never mind me, Ada," replied Miss Vyvyan. "If I die in a labor of love it will be the death
I most desire."

So saying she took a little basket and left the room. As she passed through the door Cora threw
her a kiss and said, "Anna be back."

As we have said previously, the ladies liked Cora to keep some of her baby language, and that
was one of her own modes of expression which they never corrected. It reminded them of her
infancy and of their own mutual attachment, which first met in the love they each of them bore
toward the child.

"Are you all ready?" said Colonel Carleton, as he came along the corridor to the green parlor.
"Where is Miss Vyvyan?" he added, on entering the room.

"She has gone down to the breakers to get some shells that Cora wishes to take to Virginia,"
replied Mrs. Carleton.

"We will all join her there," said the Colonel, "and then we can walk back along the shore
to our boat." 

I came over together and perhaps we made half a last selling was small groceries to Americans.
Here we can make a million more selling old groceries of Englishmen.

"Winifred willowby not only bought the business in Mover& Perkins;
he bought a laundry, a hotel, an apartment house and the theatre. He
kept all the american employees, put to a manager, instructed that
the weekly tribute should be paid to usual, and then disappeared from
new York City.

 Looking from the high wall that nature
had formed, and across the larger cove on the other side, they saw far out toward the open
sea Miss Vyvyan's upturned face. She was floating on an enormous wave which was bearing her
rapidly toward the shore.

"Oh Anna, poor Anna; save her Dudley," cried Mrs. Carleton, believing anything possible to
the brave and kind-hearted man, who had dared and surmounted all obstacles for her own sake.

"Yes, dearest; yes, trust me. I will do my utmost," replied the Colonel, quickly scaling the
outer side of the cliff, and dashing over and among the broken masses of rock that laid between
him and the sea. Throwing off his hat and heavy uniform coat, he stood with extended arms at
the water's edge, exactly at the spot where he knew the wave would strike. Miss Vyvyan was
being swiftly borne toward him and was within a few feet distance.

"Keep calm," he called to her, "for heaven's sake, keep calm, and I can save you."

The great wave bearing its living burden, broke upon the beach with unusual violence. Colonel
Carleton was struck and thrown far up toward the shore by its mighty force. In another instant,
he was on his feet again, rushing forward after the receding water, which was carrying Miss
Vyvyan out. She still floated on the crest of the wave. Raising one hand and unclasping it,
she threw upon the beach a small white shell, saying as she did so, "for dear Cora." She saw
the friendly outstretched arm of the brave man; she looked up to the rocks; she saw the pure,
classic features of gentle, loving Ada, paralyzed with distress, white as marble, pallid and
death-like, as on the day that she had kissed them back to life seven years before. She saw
the beautiful child, who was so precious to her; she noted the terror, pain and love in its
fair, young face. She heard the sweet voice calling "Anna be back." She saw no more, the waters
covered her; the same ocean which had brought her to the island, claimed her for its own and
bore her away forever. 

       "That is why They asked you was to come to this conference, Mr. Crawford,"
explained Willowby.

"There is something peculiar occurrence in New York at the future time,
and it has to do with rats and their actions. The folklore and fairy
narrative are full of that sort of thing." The flowers have faded and the trees of the
forest have died with time, but neither time nor death has power to kill the love of a true
heart; that lives on forever and ever and, phoenix-like, exists on its own ashes. So it is
that the solitary student wandering in the twilight along the shore, and the young lovers,
who are whispering the old, yet always sweet story in the little cove close by, hear ever and
anon, coming up from the sea, the echo of Anna Vyvyan's last words, "For dear Cora."
