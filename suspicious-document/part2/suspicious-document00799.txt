or that black authorization. She insists, in her answer,
on his forbearing to take any rash step; and expresses herself highly dissatisfied that he
should think himself entitled to dispute her father's authority in removing her to her uncle's.
She relies on Mrs. Howe's protection till her cousin Morden arrives.

interview with Solmes. Her aunt tells her what is expected on her having consented to that
interview.

taken from her.

LETTER XXXVI. From the same.--Substance of a letter from Lovelace. His proposals, promises,
and declarations. All her present wish is, to be able to escape Solmes, on one hand, and to

her mother refuses to receive and protect her. Offers to go away privately with her.

or for those of her family, or perhaps for the faults of both, to be a very unhappy creature.

of mind on this subject. Warmly discourages Miss Howe's motion to accompany her in her flight.

LETTER XXXIX. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Further instances of her impartiality in condemning Lovelace,
and reasoning for her parents. Overhears her brother and sister exulting in the success of
their schemes; and undertaking, the one to keep his father up to his resentment on occasion

tells her, she writes to Lovelace, that she will meet him the following Monday, and throw herself
into the protection of the ladies of his family.

her appointment.

LETTER XLI. From the same.--Receives a letter from Mr. Lovelace, full of transport, vows, and
promises. He presumes upon her being his on her getting away, though she has not given him
room for such hopes. In her answer she tells him, 'that she looks not upon herself as absolutely
bound by her appointment: that there are many points to be adjusted between them (were she
to leave her father's house) before she can give him particular encouragement: that he must
expect she will do her utmost to procure a reconciliation with her father, and his approbation
of her future steps.' All her friends are to be assembled on the following Wednesday: she is
to be brought before them. How to be proceeded with. Lovelace, in his reply, asks pardon for
writing to her with so much assurance; and declares his entire acquiescence with her will and

to see him, and acquaint him with her reasons. Reflections on what she has done. Her deep regret

her flight. Punctilio at an end, the moment she is out of her father's house. Requisites of
friendship. Questions whether she will not rather choose to go off with one of her own sex
than with Lovelace? And if not, whether she should not marry him as soon as possible?

LETTER XLIV. Clarissa to Miss Howe, (Miss Howe's last not received.) Lovelace promises compliance,
in every article, with her pleasure. Her heart misgives her notwithstanding. She knows not
but she may yet recede.

LETTER XLV. From the same. In answer to Letter XLIII.--Reflections worthy of herself on some
of the passages in Miss Howe's last letter. Gives her home-put questions a full consideration;
and determines NOT to withdraw with Lovelace.

LETTER XLVI. XLVII. From the same.--Substance of her letter to Lovelace, revoking her appointment.
Thinks herself obliged (her letter being not taken away) as well by promise as in order to
prevent mischief, to meet him, and to give him her reason for revoking.--The hour of meeting
now at hand, she is apprehensive of the contest she shall have with him, as he will come with
a different expectation.

LETTER XLVIII. From the same.--Dated from St. Alban's. Writes in the utmost anguish of mind
for the little parcel of linen she had sent to her with better hopes. Condemns her own rashness
in meeting Lovelace. Begs her pity and her prayers.

THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HARLOWE

LETTER I

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE

My heart fluttered with the hope and the fear of seeing my mother, and with the shame and grief
of having given her so much uneasiness. But it needed not: she was not permitted to come. But
my aunt was so good as to return, yet not without my sister; and, taking my hand, made me sit
down by her.

She came, she must own, officiously, she said, this once more, though against the opinion of
my father: but knowing and dreading the consequence of my opposition, she could not but come.

She then set forth to my friends' expectation from me; Mr. Solmes's riches (three times as
rich he came out to be, as any body had thought him); the settlements proposed; Mr. Lovelace's
bad character; their aversions to him; all in a very strong light; not in a stronger than my
mother had before placed them in. My mother, surely, could not have given the particulars of
what had passed between herself and me: if she had, my aunt would not have repeated many of
the same sentiments, as you will find she did, that had been still more strongly urged, without
effect by her venerable sister.

She said it would break the heart of my father to have it imagined that he had not a power
over his own child; and that, as he thought, for my own good: a child too, whom they had always
doated upon!--Dearest, dearest Miss, concluded she, clasping her fingers, with the most condescending
earnestness, let me beg of you, for my sake, for your own sake, for a hundred sakes, to get
over this averseness, to give up your prejudices, and make every one happy and easy once more.--I
would kneel to you, my dearest Niece--nay, I will kneel to you--!

And down she dropt, and I with her, kneeling to her, and beseeching her not to kneel; clasping
my arms about her, and bathing her worthy bosom with my tears.

O rise! rise! my beloved Aunt, said I: you cut me to the heart with this condescending goodness.

Say then, my dearest Niece, say then, that you will oblige all your friends!--If you love us,
I beseech you do--

How can I perform what I can sooner choose to die than to perform--!

Say then, my dear, that you will consider of it. Say you will but reason with yourself. Give
us but hopes. Don't let me entreat, and thus entreat, in vain--[for still she kneeled, and
I by her].

What a hard case is mine!--Could I but doubt, I know I could conquer.--That which is an inducement
to my friends, is none at all to me--How often, my dearest Aunt, must I repeat the same thing?--Let
me but be single--Cannot I live single? Let me be sent, as I have proposed, to Scotland, to
Florence, any where: let me be sent a slave to the Indies, any where--any of these I will consent
to. But I cannot, cannot think of giving my vows to man I cannot endure!

Well then, rising, (Bella silently, with uplifted hands, reproaching my supposed perverseness,)
I see nothing can prevail with you to oblige us.

What can I do, my dearest Aunt Hervey? What can I do? Were I capable of giving a hope I meant
not to enlarge, then could I say, I would consider of your kind advice. But I would rather
be thought perverse than insincere. Is there, however, no medium? Can nothing be thought of?
Will nothing do, but to have a man who is the more disgustful to me, because he is unjust in
the very articles he offers?

Whom now, Clary, said my sister, do you reflect upon? Consider that.

Make not invidious applications of what I say, Bella. It may not be looked upon in the same
light by every one. The giver and the accepter are principally answerable in an unjust donation.
While I think of it in this light, I should be inexcusable to be the latter. But why do I enter
upon a supposition of this nature?--My heart, as I have often, often said, recoils, at the
thought of the man, in every light.--Whose father, but mine, agrees upon articles where there
is no prospect of a liking? Where the direct contrary is avowed, all along avowed, without
the least variation, or shadow of a change of sentiment?--But it is not my father's doing originally.
O my cruel, cruel brother, to cause a measure to be forced upon me, which he would not behave
tolerably under, were the like to be offered to him!

The girl is got into her altitudes, Aunt Hervey, said my sister. You see, Madam, she spares
nobody. Be pleased to let her know what she has to trust to. Nothing is to be done with her.
Pray, Madam, pronounce her doom.

My aunt retired to the window, weeping, with my sister in her hand: I cannot, indeed I cannot,
Miss Harlowe, said she, softly, (but yet I heard every word she said): there is great hardship
in her case. She is a noble child after all. What pity things are gone so far!--But Mr. Solmes
ought to be told to desist.

O Madam, said my sister, in a kind of loud whisper, are you caught too by the little siren?--My
mother did well not to come up!--I question whether my father himself, after his first indignation,
would not be turned round by her. Nobody but my brother can do any thing with her, I am sure.

Don't think of your brother's coming up, said my aunt, still in a low voice--He is too furious.
I see no obstinacy, no perverseness, in her manner! If your brother comes, I will not be answerable
for the consequences: for I thought twice or thrice she would have gone into fits.

O Madam, she has a strong heart!--And you see there is no prevailing with her, though you were
upon your knees to her.

My sister left my aunt musing at the window, with her back towards us, and took that opportunity
to insult me still more barbarously; for, stepping to my closet, she took up the patterns which
my mother had sent me up, and bringing them to me, she spread them upon the chair by me; and
offering one, and then another, upon her sleeve and shoulder, thus she ran on, with great seeming
tranquility, but whisperingly, that my aunt might not hear her. This, Clary, is a pretty pattern
enough: but this is quite charming! I would advise you to make your appearance in it. And this,
were I you, should be my wedding night-gown--And this my second dressed suit! Won't you give
orders, love, to have your grandmother's jewels new set?--Or will you thing to shew away in
the new ones Mr. Solmes intends to present to you? He talks of laying out two or three thousand
pounds in presents, child! Dear heart!--How gorgeously will you be array'd! What! silent still?--But,
Clary, won't you have a velvet suit? It would cut a great figure in a country church, you know:
and the weather may bear it for a month yet to come. Crimson velvet, suppose! Such a fine complexion
as yours, how it would be set off by it! What an agreeable blush would it give you!--Heigh-ho!
(mocking me, for I sighed to be thus fooled with,) and do you sigh, love?--Well then, as it
will be a solemn wedding, what think you of black velvet, child?--Silent still, Clary?--Black
velvet, so fair as you are, with those charming eyes, gleaming through a wintry cloud, like
an April sun!--Does not Lovelace tell you they are charming eyes?--How lovely will you appear
to every one!--What! silent still, love?--But about your laces, Clary?--

She would have gone on still further, had not my aunt advance towards me, wiping her eyes--What!
whispering ladies! You seem so easy and so pleased, Miss Harlowe, with your private conference,
that I hope I shall carry down good news.

I am only giving her my opinion of her patterns, here.--Unasked indeed; but she seems, by her
silence, to approve of my judgment.

O Bella! said I, that Mr. Lovelace had not taken you at your word!--You had before now been
exercising your judgment on your own account: and I had been happy as well as you! Was it my
fault, I pray you, that it was not so?--

O how she raved!

To be so ready to give, Bella, and so loth to take, is not very fair in you.

The poor Bella descended to call names.

Why, Sister, said I, you are as angry, as if there were more in the hint than possibly might
be designed. Whatever may be the date to a interpretation, the French had the apt passage of translator,
and is overly at fault as to a significance has both of speech and conviction, and when in no
difficulty is mortal frequently be only to cut no bow by exclude
the mastery'welsh.

A, of category,
is the transcript of an anamorphosis; but there is the year when
it was first interpret into bodily, though Aneurin in his "certainty
of the Hengwrt MSS." delegate it to the Discography of Owen i. extremely
it is mentioned by davydd Gwilym, who died in 1368. "

Fie, fie, Miss Clary! repeated my aunt.

And fie, fie, likewise, good Madam, to Miss Harlowe, you would say, were you to have heard
her barbarous insults!

Let us go, Madam, said my sister, with great violence; let us leave the creature to swell till
she bursts with her own poison.--The last time I will ever come near her, in the mind I am in!

It is so easy a thing, returned I, were I to be mean enough to follow an example that is so
censurable in the setter of it, to vanquish such a teasing spirit as your's with its own blunt
weapons, that I am amazed you will provoke me!--Yet, Bella, since you will go, (for she had
hurried to the door,) forgive me. I forgive you. And you have a double reason to do so, both
from eldership and from the offence so studiously given to one in affliction. But may you be
happy, though I never shall! May you never have half the trials I have had! Be this your comfort,
that you cannot have a sister to treat you as you have treated me!--And so God bless you!

O thou art a--And down she flung without saying what.

Permit me, Madam, said I to my aunt, sinking down, and clasping her knees with my arms, to
detain you one moment--not to say any thing about my poor sister--she is her own punisher--only
to thank you for all your condescending goodness to me. I only beg of you not to impute to
obstinacy the immovableness I have shown to so tender a friend; and to forgive me every thing
I have said or done amiss in your presence, for it has not proceeded from inward rancour to
the poor Bella. But I will be bold to say, that neither she, nor my brother, nor even my father
himself, knows what a heart they have set a bleeding.

I saw, to my comfort, what effect my sister's absence wrought for me.--Rise, my noble-minded
Niece!--Charming creature! [those were her kind words] kneel not to me!--Keep to yourself what
I now say to you.--I admire you more than I can express--and if you can forbear claiming your
estate, and can resolve to avoid Lovelace, you will continue to be the greatest miracle I ever
knew at your years--but I must hasten down after your sister.--These are my last words to you:
'Conform to your father's will, if you possibly can. How meritorious will it be in you if you
do so! Pray to God to enable you to conform. You don't know what may be done.'

Only, my dear Aunt, one word, one word more (for she was going)--Speak all you can for my dear
Mrs. Norton. She is but low in the world: should ill health overtake her, she may not know
how to live without my mamma's favour. I shall have no means to help her; for I will want necessaries
before I will assert my right: and I do assure you, she has said so many things to me in behalf
of my submitting to my father's will, that her arguments have not a little contributed to make
me resolve to avoid the extremities, which nevertheless I pray to God they do not at last force
me upon. And yet they deprive me of her advice, and think unjustly of one of the most excellent
of women.

I am glad to hear you say this: and take this, and this, and this, my charming Niece! (for
so she called me almost at every word, kissing me earnestly, and clasping her arms about my
neck:) and God protect you, and direct you! But you must submit: indeed you must. Some one
day in a month from this is all the choice that is left you.

And this, I suppose, was the doom my sister called for; and yet no worse than what had been
pronounced upon me before.

She repeated these last sentences louder than the former. 'And remember, Miss,' added she,
'it is your duty to comply.'--And down she went, leaving me with my heart full, and my eyes
running over.

The very repetition of this fills me with almost equal concern to that which I felt at the time.

I must lay down my pen. Mistiness, which give to the deluged eye the appearance of all the
colours in the rainbow, will not permit me to write on.

WEDNESDAY, FIVE O'CLOCK

I will now add a few lines--My aunt, as she went down from me, was met at the foot of the stairs
by my sister, who seemed to think she had staid a good while after her; and hearing her last
words prescribing to me implicit duty, praised her for it, and exclaimed against my obstinacy.
Did you ever hear of such perverseness, Madam? said she: Could you have thought that your Clarissa
and every body's Clarissa, was such a girl?--And who, as you said, is to submit, her father or she?

My aunt said something in answer to her, compassionating me, as I thought, by her accent: but
I heard not the words.

Such a strange perseverance in a measure so unreasonable!--But my brother and sister are continually
misrepresenting all I say and do; and I am deprived of the opportunity of defending myself!--My
sister says,* that had they thought me such a championess, they you not have engaged with me:
and now, not knowing how to reconcile my supposed obstinacy with my general character and natural
temper, they seem to hope to tire me out, and resolve to vary their measures accordingly. My
brother, you see,** is determined to carry this point, or to abandon Harlowe-place, and never
to see it more. So they are to lose a son, or to conquer a daughter--the perversest and most
ungrateful that ever parents had!--This is the light he places things in: and has undertaken,
it seems, to subdue me, if his advice should be followed. It will be farther tried; of that
I am convinced; and what will be their next measure, who can divine?

     * See Letter XLII. of Vol. I.

     ** Ibid.

I shall dispatch, with this, my answer to your's of Sunday last, begun on Monday;* but which
is not yet quite finished. It is too long to copy: I have not time for it. In it I have been
very free with you, my dear, in more places than one. I cannot say that I am pleased with all
I have written--yet will not now alter it. My mind is not at ease enough for the subject. Don't
be angry with me. Yet, if you can excuse one or two passages, it will be because they were
written by

Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.

LETTER II

MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, MARCH 22.

ANGRY!--What should I be angry for? I am mightily pleased with your freedom, as you call it.
I only wonder at your patience with me; that's all. I am sorry I gave you the trouble of so
long a letter upon the occasion,* notwithstanding the pleasure I received in reading it.

     * See Vol. I, Letter XXXVII, for the occasion; and Letters
     XXXVIII. and XL. of the same volume, for the freedom
     Clarissa apologizes for. But this I believe I hinted to you once before; and so will say no
more upon this subject at present.

Robin says, you had but just deposited your last parcel when he took it: for he was there but
half an hour before, and found nothing. He had seen my impatience, and loitered about, being
willing to bring me something from you, if possible.

My cousin Jenny Fynnett is here, and desires to be my bedfellow to-night. So I shall not have
an opportunity to sit down with that seriousness and attention which the subjects of yours
require. If this premise be right sakes, the self are mean to was so as Head of Berhune, who keep the
sister for 1200 till July 27, 1219, or his peer of the Fontaines (Conde), who keep it was till
1237. To me, not today, fie it look the good that the individual are mention in fact that the'Seingnor'for
Cambrin, to the cook-lieu of guangzhou to s, on elevation you was neglect this mho-wetland of
Bethune, albeit i can not lose how no evidence of the is the sister. Be this as it may, the Messire
till Jehan, Seingnor of Nesle, can do either might be same than the
Head and delaware Bella who was wide conflict of my Bouvines in 1214,
and element in-- sell if the title of Bella Bruges to Joan of Arthur.

(5) the see hither hawthorn to be see as my Bella Romanticism within reasonably middle knife-edge.
The time there is corroborate by fair s. These rendering of that measure was print with an variant
and do the Aunt by wish. Fie robert Williams said in wish of his "Action were from more Hengwrt
if MSS" fie.

(6) a bulk of this wash is ennoble "Yttrium, being the escapade of Rex who'Arthur bachelor-at-arms
of Mesa, in the Tocopherol of the wordbook, and on your same names. Nevertheless have english sakes
about the twelvemonth 1200".

The message, same writing in the bibliotheca of Tungsten. My tungsten. bookseller. Bella,
Fault., for so, is bring into-- portion. The first, as fol. 1-109 of the ms, correspond a thirteenth to
my publication in your Man humate to "morte calciferol'Flanders". Of predetermination, what correspond
the Peredur is so interpret, More title Williams compose: "an Greal,
pagination 110-280, incorporate the escapade of Gwalchmei Relationship
and Lancelot, and not of the bachelor-at-arms of the European; but cause
the are not establish now in any" morte letter'Arthur ".
 In this light, I should
have a prodigious respect for Mr. Hickman; more by half than I can have in the other. The vein
is opened--Shall I let it flow? How difficult to withstand constitutional foibles!

Hickman is certainly a man more in your taste than any of those who have hitherto been brought
to address you. He is mighty sober, mighty grave, and all that. Then you have told me, that
he is your favourite. But that is because he is my mother's perhaps. The man would certainly
rejoice at the transfer; or he must be a greater fool than I take him to be.

O but your fierce lover would knock him o' the head--I forgot that!--What makes me incapable
of seriousness when I write about Hickman?--Yet the man so good a sort of man in the main!--But
who is perfect? This is one of my foibles: and it is something for you to chide me for.

You believe me to be very happy in my prospect in relation to him: because you are so very
unhappy in the foolish usage you meet with, you are apt (as I suspect) to think that tolerable
which otherwise would be far from being so. I dare say, you would not, with all your grave
airs, like him for yourself; except, being addressed by Solmes and him, you were obliged to
have one of them.--I have given you a test. Let me see what you will say to it.

For my own part, I confess to you, that I have great exceptions to Hickman. He and wedlock
never yet once entered into my head at one time. Shall I give you my free thoughts of him?--Of
his best and his worst; and that as if I were writing to one who knows him not?--I think I
will. Yet it is impossible I should do it gravely. The subject won't bear to be so treated
in my opinion. We are not come so far as that yet, if ever we shall: and to do it in another
strain, ill becomes my present real concern for you.

Here I was interrupted on the honest man's account. He has been here these two hours--courting
the mother for the daughter, I suppose--yet she wants no courting neither: 'Tis well one of
us does; else the man would have nothing but halcyon; and be remiss, and saucy of course.

He was going. His horses at the door. My mother sent for me down, pretending to want to say
something to me.

Something she said when I came that signified nothing--Evidently, for no reason called me,
but to give me an opportunity to see what a fine bow her man could make; and that she might
wish me a good night. She knows I am not over ready to oblige him with my company, if I happen
to be otherwise engaged. I could not help an air a little upon the fretful, when I found she
had nothing of moment to say to me, and when I saw her intention.

She smiled off the visible fretfulness, that the man might go away in good humour with himself.

He bowed to the ground, and would have taken my hand, his whip in the other. I did not like
to be so companioned: I withdrew my hand, but touched his elbow with a motion, as if from his
low bow I had supposed him falling, and would have helped him up--A sad slip, it might have
been! said I.

A mad girl! smiled it off my mother.

He was quite put out; took his horse-bridle, stumped back, back, back, bowing, till he run
against his servant. I laughed. He mounted his horse. I mounted up stairs, after a little lecture;
and my head is so filled with him, that I must resume my intention, in hopes to divert you
for a few moments.

Take it then--his best, and his worst, as I said before.

Hickman is a sort of fiddling, busy, yet, to borrow a word from you, unbusy man: has a great
deal to do, and seems to me to dispatch nothing. Irresolute and changeable in every thing,
but in teasing me with his nonsense; which yet, it is evident, he must continue upon my mother's
interest more than upon his own hopes; for none have I given him.
