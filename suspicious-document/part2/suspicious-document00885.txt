As he paused, he listened; but all distinctiveness of sound was lost in the play of the wind,
up hill and down dale, through chasm and over crag, in those uncounted leagues of forest. It
was only a summer wind, soft and from the south; but its murmur had the sweep of the eternal
breath, while, when it waxed in power, it rose like the swell of some great cosmic organ. Through
the pines and in the underbrush it whispered and crackled and crashed, with a variety of effect
strangely bewildering to the young man's city-nurtured senses. There were minutes when he felt
that not only the four country constables whom he had escaped were about to burst upon him,
but that weird armies of gnomes were ready to trample him down.

Out of the confusion of wood-noises, in which his unpractised ear could distinguish nothing,
he waited for a repetition of the shots which a few hours ago had been the protest of his guards;
but, none coming, he sped on again. He weighed the danger of running in the open against the
opportunities for speed, and decided in favor of the latter. Hitherto, in accordance with a
woodcraft invented to meet the emergency, and entirely his own, he had avoided anything in
the nature of a road or a pathway, in order to take advantage of the tracklessness which formed
his obvious protection; but now he judged the moment come for putting actual space between
his pursuers and himself. How near, or how far behind him, they might be he could not guess.
If he had covered ground, they would have covered it too, since they were men born to the mountains,
while he had been bred in towns. His hope lay in the possibility that in this wilderness he
might be lost to their ken, as a mote is lost in the air--though he built something on the
chance that, in sympathy with the feeling in his favor pervading the simpler population of
the region, they had given negative connivance to his escape. These thoughts, far from stimulating
a false confidence, urged him to greater speed.

And yet, even as he fled, he had a consciousness of abandoning something--perhaps of deserting
something--which brought a strain of regret into this minute of desperate excitement. Without
having had time to count the cost or reckon the result, he felt he was giving up the fight.
He, or his counsel for him, had contested the ground with all the resourceful ingenuity known
to the American legal practitioner. He was told that, in spite of the seeming finality of what
had happened that morning, there were still loopholes through which the defence might be carried
on. In the space of a few hours Fate had offered him the choice between two courses, neither
of them fertile in promises of success. The one was long and tedious, with a possibility of
ultimate justification; the other short and speedy, with the accepted imputation of guilt.
He had chosen the latter--instinctively and on the spur of the moment; and while he might have
repeated at leisure the decision he had made in haste, he knew even now that he was leaving
the ways and means of proving his innocence behind him. The perception came, not as the result
of a process of thought, but as a regretful, scarcely detected sensation.

He had dashed at first into the broken country, hilly rather than mountainous, which from the
shores of Lake Champlain gradually gathers strength, as it rolls inland, to toss up the crests
of the Adirondacks. Here, burying himself in the woods, he skirted the unkempt farms, whose
cottage lights, just beginning to burn, served him as signals to keep farther off. When forced
to cross one of the sterile fields, he crawled low, blotting himself out among the bowlders.
At times a patch of tall, tasselled Indian corn, interlaced with wandering pumpkin vines, gave
him cover, till he regained the shelter of the vast Appalachian mother-forest which, after
climbing Cumberlands, Alleghanies, Catskills, and Adirondacks, here clambers down, in long
reaches of ash and maple, juniper and pine, toward the lowlands of the north.

As far as he had yet been able to formulate a plan of flight, it was to seek his safety among
the hills. The necessity of the instant was driving him toward the open country and the lake,
but he hoped to double soon upon his tracks, finding his way back to the lumber camps, whose
friendly spiriting from bunk-house to bunk-house would baffle pursuit. Once he had gained even
a few hours' security, he would be able to some extent to pick and choose his way.

He steered himself by the peak of Graytop, black against the last coral-tinted glow of the
sunset, as a sailor steers by a star. There was further assurance that he was not losing himself
or wandering in a circle, when from some chance outlook he ventured to glance backward and
saw the pinnacle of Windy Mountain or the dome of the Pilot straight behind him. She believe i

What was the motive of these remarks? Ford found himself possessed of a strange curiosity to
know. He pressed as closely as he dared to the open door, but for the moment nothing more was
said. In the silence that followed he began again to wonder how he could best make his demand
for food, when a sound from behind startled him. It was the sound which, among all others,
caused him the wildest alarm--that of a human footstep. His next movement came from the same
blind impulse that sends a hunted fox to take refuge in a church--eager only for the instant's
safety. He had sprung to his feet, cleared the threshold, and leaped into the room, before
the reflection came to him that, if he was caught, he must at least be caught game. Wheeling
round toward the window-door through which he had entered, he stood defiantly, awaiting his
pursuers, and heedless of the astonished eyes fixed upon him. It was not till some seconds
had gone by, and he realized that he was not followed, that he glanced about the room. When
he did so it was to ignore the woman, in order to concentrate all his gaze on the little, iron-gray
man who, still seated, stared at him, with lips parted. In his own turn, Norrie Ford was dumb
and wide-eyed in amazement It was a long minute before either spoke.

"You?"

"You?"

The monosyllable came simultaneously from each. The little woman got to her feet in alarm. "a Quart

 "I shall bring you more things by degrees."

On a chair beside that on which he was sitting she laid a pair of slippers, a pair of socks,
a shirt, a collar, and a tie.

He jumped up hastily, less in surprise than in confusion.

"I can't take anything of Judge Wayne's--" he began to stammer; but she interrupted him.

"I understand your feelings about that," she said, simply. "They're not Judge Wayne's; they
were my father's. I have plenty more."

In his relief at finding she was not Wayne's daughter he spoke awkwardly.

"Your father? Is he--dead?"

"Yes; he's dead. You needn't be afraid to take the things. He would have liked to help a man--in
your position."

"In my position? Then you know--who I am?"

"Yes; you're Norrie Ford. I saw that as soon as I chanced on the terrace last night."

"And you're not afraid of me?"

"I am--a little," she admitted; "but that doesn't matter."

"You needn't be--" he began to explain, but she checked him again.

"We mustn't talk now. I must shut the door and leave you in the dark all day. Men will be passing
by, and they mustn't hear you. I shall be painting in the studio, so that they won't suspect
anything, if you keep still."

Allowing him no opportunity to speak again, she closed the door, leaving him once more in darkness.
Sitting in the constraint she imposed upon him, he could hear her moving in the outer room,
where, owing to the lightness of the wooden partition, it was not difficult to guess what she
was doing at any given moment. He knew when she opened the outer door and moved the easel toward
the entrance. He knew when she took down the apron from its peg and pinned it on. He knew when
she drew up a chair and pretended to set to work. In the hour or two of silence that ensued
he was sure that, whatever she might be doing with her brush, she was keeping eye and ear alert
in his defence.

Who was she? What interest had she in his fate? What power had raised her up to help him? Even
yet he had scarcely seen her face; but he had received an impression of intelligence. He was
sure she was no more than a girl--certainly not twenty--and yet she acted with the decision
of maturity. At the same time there was about her that suggestion of a wild origin--that something
not wholly tamed to the dictates of civilized life--which persisted in his imagination, even
if he could not verify it in fact.

Twice in the course of the morning he heard voices. Men spoke to her through the open doorway,
and she replied. Once he distinguished her words.

"Oh no," she called out to some one at a distance. "I'm not afraid. He won't do me any harm.
I've got Micmac with me. I often stay here all day, but I shall go home early. Thanks," she
added, in response to some further hint. "I'd rather not have any one here. I never can paint
unless I'm quite alone."

Her tone was light, and Ford fancied that as she spoke she smiled at the passers-by who had
thought it right to warn her against himself; but when, a few minutes later, she pushed open
the door softly, the gravity that seemed more natural to her had returned.

"Several parties of men have gone by," she whispered. "They have no suspicion. They won't have,
if you keep still. They think you have slipped away from here, and have gone back toward the
lumber camps. This is your lunch," she continued, hastily, placing more food before him. "It
will have to be your dinner, too. It will be safer for me not to come into this room again
to-day. You must not go out into the studio till you're sure it's dark. No noise. No light.
I've put an extra rug on the couch in case you're chilly in the night."

She spoke breathlessly, in whispers, and, having finished, slipped away.

"You're awfully good," he whispered back. "Won't you tell me your name?"

"Hush!" she warned him, as she closed the door.

He stood still in the darkness, leaving his food untasted, listening to the soft rustle of
her movements beyond the wall. Except that he heard no more voices, the afternoon passed like
the morning. At the end of what seemed to him interminable hours he knew by acute attention
that she hung her apron on its peg, put on her hat, and took up her basket, while Micmac rose
and shook himself. Presently she closed the door of the cabin and locked it on the outside.
He fancied he could almost hear her step as she sped over the grass and into the forest. Only
then did the tension of his nerves relax, as, dropping to his chair in the darkness, he began
to eat.

IV

The two or three days that followed were much like the first. Each morning she came early,
bringing him food, and such articles of clothing as she thought he could wear. By degrees she
provided him with a complete change of raiment, and though the fit was tolerable, they laughed
together at the transformation produced in him. It was the first time he had seen her smile,
and even in the obscurity of the inner room where she still kept him secluded he noted the
vividness with which her habitually grave features lighted up. Micmac, too, became friendly,
inferring with the instinct of his race that Ford was an object to be guarded.

"No one would know you now," the girl declared, surveying him with satisfaction.

"Were these things all your father's?" he asked, with a new attempt to penetrate the mystery
of her personality.

"Yes," she returned, absently, continuing her inspection of him. "They were sent to me, and
I kept them. I never knew why I did; but I suppose it was--for this."

"He must have been a tall man?" Ford hazarded, again.

"Yes, he must have been," she returned, unwarily. Then, feeling that the admission required
some explanation, she added, with a touch of embarrassment, "I never saw him--not that I can
remember."

"Then he died a long time ago?"

Her reply came reluctantly, after some delay:

"Not so very long--about four years ago now."

"And yet you hadn't seen him since you were a child?"

"There were reasons. We mustn't talk. Some one may pass and hear us."

He could see that her hurry in finishing the small tasks she had come in to perform for him
arose not so much from precaution as from a desire to escape from this particular subject.

"I suppose you could tell me his name?" he persisted.

Her hands moved deftly, producing order among the things he had left in confusion, but she
remained silent. It was a silence in which he recognized an element of protest though he ignored
it.

"You could tell me his name?" he asked, again.

"His name," she said, at last, "wouldn't convey anything to you. It wouldn't do you any good
to know it."

"It would gratify my curiosity. I should think you might do as much as that for me."

"I'm doing a great deal for you as it is. I don't think you should ask for more."

Her tone was one of reproach rather than of annoyance, and he was left with a sense of having
committed an indiscretion. The consciousness brought with it the perception that in a measure
he was growing used to his position. He was beginning to take it for granted that this girl
should come and minister to his wants. She herself did it so simply, so much as a matter of
course, that the circumstance lost much of its strangeness. Now and then he could detect some
confusion in her manner as she served him, but he could see too that she surmounted it, in
view of the fact that for him the situation was one of life and death. She was clearly not
indifferent to elementary social usages; she only saw that the case was one in which they did
not obtain. In his long, unoccupied hours of darkness it distracted his thoughts from his own
peril to speculate about her; and when she appeared his questions were the more blunt because
of the small opportunity she allowed for asking them.

"Won't they miss you at home?" he inquired, on the next occasion when she entered his cell.

She paused with a look of surprise.

"At home? Where do you mean?"

"Why--where you live; where your mother lives."

"My mother died a few months after I was born."

"Oh! But even so, you live somewhere, don't you?"

"I do; but they don't miss me there, if that's what you want to know."

"I was only afraid," he said, apologetically, "that you were giving me too much of your time."

In the two years that followed he could not see what purpose he served other than that of a
mark for the old man's poisoned wit. He was taught nothing, and paid nothing, and given nothing
to do. He slept under his great-uncle's roof and ate at his table, but the sharp tongue made
the bed hard to lie on and the bread difficult to swallow down. Idleness reawakened the propensity
to vicious habits which he thought he had outlived, while the rough society of the lumber camps,
in which he sought to relieve the tedium of time, extended him the welcome which Falstaff and
his comrades gave Prince Hal.

The revolt of his self-respect was on the eve of bringing this phase of his existence to an
end when the low farce turned into tragedy. Old Chris Ford was found dead in his bed--shot
in his sleep. On the premises there had been but three persons, one of whom must have committed
the crime--Norrie Ford, and Jacob and Amalia Gramm. Jacob and Amalia Gramm had been the old
man's servants for thirty years. Their faithfulness put them beyond suspicion. The possibility
of their guilt, having been considered, was dismissed with few formalities. The conviction
of Norrie Ford became easy after that--the more respectable people of the neighborhood being
agreed that from the evidence presented no other deduction could be drawn. The very fact that
the old man, by his provocation of the lad, so thoroughly deserved his fate made the manner
in which he met with it the clearer. Even Norrie Ford's friends, the hunters and the lumbermen,
admitted as much as that, though they were determined that he should never suffer for so meritorious
an act as long as they could give him a fighting chance for freedom.

The girl listened to Ford's narrative with some degree of interest, though it contained nothing
new to her. She could not have lived at Greenport during the period of his trial without being
familiar with it all. But when he came to explanations in his own defence she followed listlessly.
Though she leaned back in her chair, and courteously stopped painting, while he talked so earnestly,
the light in her eyes faded to a lustreless gleam, like that of the black pearl. His perception
that her thoughts were wandering gave him a queer sensation of speaking into a medium in which
his voice could not carry, cutting short his arguments, and bringing him to his conclusion
more hurriedly than he had intended.

"I wanted you to know I didn't do it," he finished, in a tone which begged for some expression
of her belief, "because you've done so much to help me."

"Oh, but I should have helped you just the same, whether you had done it or not."

"But I suppose it makes some difference to you," he cried, impatiently, "to know that I didn't."

"I suppose it would," she admitted, slowly, "if I thought much about it."

"Well, won't you think?" he pleaded---"just to oblige me."

"Perhaps I will, when you're gone; but at present I have to give my mind to getting you away.
It was to talk about that that I came this morning."

Had she wanted to slip out of giving an opinion on the subject of his guilt, she could not
have found a better exit. The means of his ultimate escape engrossed him even more than the
theme of his innocence. When she spoke again all his faculties were concentrated into one keen
point of attention.

"I think the time has come for you to--go."

If her voice trembled on the last word, he did not notice it. The pose of his body, the lines
of his face, the glint of his gray eyes, were alive with interrogation.

"Go?" he asked, just audibly. "When?"

"To-morrow."

"How?"

"I'll tell you that then."

"Why can't you tell me now?"

"I could if I was sure you wouldn't raise objections, but I know you will."

"Then there are objections to be raised?"

"There are objections to everything. There's no plan of escape that won't expose you to a good
many risks. I'd rather you didn't see them in advance."

"But isn't it well to be prepared beforehand?"

"You'll have plenty of time for preparation--after you've started. If that seems mysterious
to you now, you'll know what I mean by it when I come to-morrow. I shall be here in the afternoon
at six."

With this information Ford was obliged to be content, spending a sleepless night and an impatient
day, waiting for the time appointed.

She came punctually. For the first time she was not followed by her dog. The only change in
her appearance he could see was a short skirt of rough material instead of her usual linen
or muslin.

"Are we going through the woods?" he asked.

"Not far. I shall take you by the trail that led to this spot before I built the cabin and
made the path." As she spoke she surveyed him. "You'll do," she smiled at last. "In those flannels,
and with your beard, no one would know you for the Norrie Ford of three weeks ago."

It was easy for him to ascribe the glow in her eyes and the quiver in her voice to the excitement
of the moment; for he could see that she had the spirit of adventure. Perhaps it was to conceal
some embarrassment under his regard that she spoke again, hurriedly.

"We've no time to lose. You needn't take anything from here. We'd better start."

He followed her over the threshold, and as she turned to lock the cabin he had time to throw
a glance of farewell over the familiar hills, now transmuted into a haze of amethyst under
the westering sun. A second later he heard her quick "Come on!" as she struck into the barely
perceptible path that led upward, around the shoulder of the mountain.

It was a stiff bit of climbing, but she sped along with the dryad-like ease she had displayed
on the night when she led him to the cabin. Beneath the primeval growth of ash and pine there
was an underbrush so dense that no one but a creature gifted with the inherited instinct of
the woods could have found the invisible, sinuous line alone possible to the feet. But it was
there, and she traced it--never pausing never speaking, and only looking back from time to
time to assure herself that he was in sight, until they reached the top of the dome-shaped hill.

They came out suddenly on a rocky terrace, beneath which, a mile below, Champlain was spread
out in great part of its length, from the dim bluff of Crown Point to the far-away, cloud-like
mountains of Canada.

"You can sit down a minute here," she said, as he came up.

They found seats among the low scattered bowlders, but neither spoke. It was a moment at which
to understand the jewelled imagery of the Seer of the Apocalypse. Jasper, jacinth, chalcedony,
emerald, chrysoprasus, were suggested by the still bosom of the lake, towered round by light-reflecting
mountains. The triple tier of the Vermont shore was bottle-green at its base, indigo in the
middle height, while its summit was a pale undulation of evanescent blue against the jade and
topaz of the twilight.

"The steamer Empress of Erin," the girl said, with what seemed like abruptness, "will sail
from Montreal on the twenty-eighth, and from Quebec on the twenty-ninth. From Rimouski, at
the mouth of the river St. Lawrence, she will sail on the thirtieth, to touch nowhere else
till she reaches Ireland. You will take her at Rimouski."

There was a silence, during which he tried to absorb this startling information. 

"he can have not be dropped of it asked himself to opportunity."

"amply, t have to like i there are descend to see it was forced to-kind. I curled our reserves (nos artiflots)

 However ignoble, there had been
a place for him. But out here on the great vacant lake there was an isolation that gave reality
to his expulsion. The last man left on earth would not feel more utterly alone.

For the first time since the night of his escape there came back to him that vague feeling
of deserting something he might have defended, that almost physical sensation of regret at
not having stood his ground and fought till he fell. He began to understand now what it meant.
Dip, splash, dip, splash, his paddle stirred the dimly shining water, breaking into tiny whirlpools
the tremulous reflection of the stars. Not for an instant did he relax his stroke, though the
regret took more definitive shape behind him. Convicted and sentenced, he was still part of
the life of men, just as a man whom others are trying to hurl from a tower is on the tower
till he has fallen. He himself had not fallen; he had jumped off, while there was still a chance
of keeping his foothold.

It required an hour or two of outward rhythmic movement and confused inward feeling to get
him ready for his next mental step. He had jumped off the tower; true; but he was alive and
well, with no bones broken. What should he do now? Should he try to tear the tower down? The
attempt would not be so very ludicrous, seeing he should only have to join those--socialists,
anarchists, faddists--already at the work. But he admired the tower, and preferred to see is
stand. If he did anything at all, it would be to try to creep back into it.

The reflection gave still another turn to his thoughts. He was passing Burlington by this time--the
electric lamps throwing broad bands of light along the deserted, up-hill streets, between the
sleeping houses. It was the first city he had seen since leaving New York to begin his useless
career in the mountains. The sight moved him with an odd curiosity, not free from a homesick
longing for normal, simple ways of life. He kept the canoe at a standstill, looking hungrily
up the empty thoroughfares, as a poor ghost may gaze at familiar scenes while those it has
loved are dreaming. By-and-by the city seemed to stir in its sleep. Along the waterside he
could hear the clatter of some belated or too early wayfarer; a weird, intermittent creaking
told him that the milk-cart of provincial towns was on its beat; from a distant freight-train
came the long, melancholy wail that locomotives give at night; and then drowsily, but with
the promptness of one conscientious in his duty, a cock crew. Ford knew that somewhere, unseen
as yet by him, the dawn was coming, and--again like a wandering ghost--sped on.

But he had been looking on the tower which the children of men had builded, and had recognized
his desire to clamber up into it again. He was not without the perception that a more fiery
temperament than his own--perhaps a nobler one--would have cursed the race that had done him
wrong, and sought to injure it or shun it. Misty recollections of proud-hearted men who had
taken this stand came back to him.

"I suppose I ought to do the same," he muttered to himself humbly; "but what would be the use
when I couldn't keep it up?"

Understanding himself thus well, his purpose became clearer. Like the ant or the beaver that
has seen its fabric destroyed, he must set patiently to work to reconstruct it. He suspected
a poor-spirited element in this sort of courage; but his instinct forced him within his limitations.
By dint of keeping there and toiling there he felt sure of his ability to get back to the top
of the tower in such a way that no one would think he lacked the right to be on it.

But he himself would know it. He shrank from that fact with the repugnance of an honest nature
for what is not straightforward; but the matter was past helping. He should be obliged to play
the impostor everywhere and with every one. He would mingle with men, shake their hands, share
their friendships, eat their bread, and accept their favors--and deceive them under their very
noses. Life would become one long trick, one daily feat of skill. Any possible success he could
win would lack stability, would lack reality, because there would be neither truth nor fact
behind it.

From the argument that he was innocent he got little comfort. He had forfeited his right to
make use of that fact any longer. Had he stayed where he was he could have shouted it out till
they gagged him in the death-chair. Now he must be dumb on the subject forevermore. In his
disappearance there was an acceptation of guilt which he must remain powerless to explain away.

Many minutes of dull pain passed in dwelling on that point. He could work neither back from
it nor forward. His mind could only dwell on it with an aching admission of its justice, while
he searched the sky for the dawn.

In spite of the crowing of the cock he saw no sign of it--unless it was that the mountains
on the New York shore detached themselves more distinctly from the sky of which they had seemed
to form a part. On the Vermont side there was nothing but a heaped-up darkness, night piled
on night, till the eye reached the upper heavens and the stars.

He paddled on, steadily, rhythmically, having no sense of hunger or fatigue, while he groped
for the clew that was to guide him when he stepped on land. He felt the need of a moral programme,
of some pillar of cloud and fire that would show him a way he should be justified in taking.
He expressed it to himself by a kind of aspiration which he kept repeating, sometimes half aloud:

"O Lord, O Holy One! I want to be a man!"

Suddenly he struck the water with so violent a dash that the canoe swerved and headed landward.

"By God!" he muttered, under his breath, "I've got it.... It isn't my fault.... It's theirs....
They've put me in this fix.... They've brought this dodging, and shifting, and squirming upon
me.... The subterfuge isn't mine; it's theirs.... They've taken the responsibility from me....
When they strip me of rights they strip me of duties.... They've forced me where right and
wrong don't exist for me any more.... They've pitched me out of their Organized Society, and
I've had to go.... Now I'm free ... and I shall profit by my freedom."

In the excitement of these discoveries he smote the waters again. He remembered having said
something of the sort on the night of his interview with Wayne; but he had not till now grasped
its significance. It was the emancipation of his conscience. Whatever difficulties he might
encounter from outside, he should be hampered by no scruples from within. He had been relieved
of them; they had been taken from him. Since none had a duty toward him, he had no duty toward
any. If it suited his purposes to juggle with men, the blame must rest upon themselves. He
could but do his best with the maimed existence they had left to him. Self-respect would entail
observance of the common laws of truth and honesty, but beyond this he need never allow consideration
for another to come before consideration for himself. He was absolved from the necessity in
advance. In the region in which he should pass his inner life there would be no occupant but
himself. From the world where men and women had ties of love and pity and mutual regard they
had cast him out, forcing him into a spiritual limbo where none of these things obtained. It
was only lawful that he should make use of such advantages as his lot allowed him.

There was exaltation in the way in which he grasped this creed as his rule of life; and looking
up suddenly, he saw the dawn. It had taken him unawares, stealing like a gray mist of light
over the tops of the Vermont hills, lifting their ridges faintly out of night, like the ghosts
of so many Titans. Among the Adirondacks one high peak caught the first glimmer of advancing
day, while all the lower range remained a gigantic silhouette beneath the perceptibly paling
stars. Over Canada the veil was still down, but he fancied he could detect a thinner texture
to the darkness.

Then, as he passed a wooded headland, came a sleepy twitter, from some little pink and yellow
bill barely withdrawn from its enfolding wing--to be followed by another, and another, and
another, till both shores were aquiver with that plaintive chirrup, half threnody for the flying
darkness, half welcome to the sun, like the praise of a choir of children roused to sing midnight
matins, but still dreaming. Ford's dip was softer now, as though he feared to disturb that
vibrant drowsiness; but when, later, capes and coves began to define themselves through the
gray gloaming, and, later still, a shimmer of saffron appeared above the eastern summits, he
knew it was time to think of a refuge from the daylight.

The saffron became fire; the fire lit up a heaven of chrysoprase and rose. Where the lake had
been as a metal mirror for the stars, it rippled and dimpled and gleamed with the tints of
mother-of-pearl. He knew the sun must be on the farther slope of the Green Mountains, because
the face they turned toward him was dense in shadow, like the unilluminated portion of the
moon. On the western shore the Adirondacks were rising out of the bath of night as dewy fresh
as if they had been just created.

But the sun was actually in the sky when he perceived that he no longer had the lake to himself.
From a village nestling in some hidden cove a rowboat pulled out into the open--a fisherman
after the morning's catch. It was easy enough for Ford to keep at a prudent distance; but the
companionship caused him an uneasiness that was not dispelled before the first morning steamer
came pounding from the northward. He fixed his attention then on a tiny islet some two or three
miles ahead. There were trees on it, and probably ferns and grass. Reaching it, he found himself
in a portion of the lake forest-banked and little frequented. Pastures and fields of ripening
grain on the most distant slopes of Vermont gave the nearest token of life. All about him there
was solitude and stillness--with the glorious, bracing beauty of the newly risen day.

Landing with stiffened limbs, he drew up the canoe on a bit of sandy beach, over which sturdy
old bushes, elder and birch, battered by the north winds, leaned in friendly, concealing protection.
He himself would be able to lie down here, among the tall ferns and the stunted blueberry-scrub,
as secluded and secure as ever he had been in prison.

Being hungry and thirsty, he ate and drank, consulting his map the while and fixing approximately
his whereabouts. He looked at his little watch and wound it up, and fingered the pages of the
railway guide he found beside it.

The acts brought up the image of the girl who had furnished him with these useful accessories
to flight. For lack of another name he called her the Wild Olive--remembering her yearning,
not wholly unlike his own, to be grafted back into the good olive-tree of Organized Society.
With some shame he perceived that he had scarcely thought of her through the night. It was
astounding to recollect that not twelve hours ago she had kissed him and sent him on his journey. Kind had

 He remembered again that the flippant young Frenchman
had said, "Un ancien curé, qui a fait quelque bêtise." Was it possible that some tragic sin
lay under this gentle life? And was the four-funnelled, twin-screwed Parana but a ghostly ship
bearing a cargo of haunted souls into their earthly purgatory?

"But listen, monsieur," the old man began next day. But listen! There would be difficulties.
Stephens and Jarrott employed only picked men, men with some experience--except for the mere
manual labor such as the Italians could perform. Wouldn't it be well for Mr. Strange to qualify
himself a little before risking a refusal? Ah, but how? Monsieur Durand would explain. There
was first the question of Spanish. No one could get along in the Argentine without a working
knowledge of that tongue. Monsieur Durand himself gave lessons in it--and in French--but in
the English and American colonies of Buenos Aires exclusively. There were reasons why he did
not care to teach among Catholics, though he himself was a fervent one, and he hoped--repentant.
He pronounced the last word with some emphasis, as though to call Strange's attention to it.
If his young friend would give him the pleasure of taking a few lessons, they could begin even
now. It would while away the time on the voyage. He had his own method of teaching, a method
based on the Berlitz system, but not borrowed from it, and, he ventured to say, possessing
its own good points. For example: el tabaco--la pipa--los cigarillos. Que es esto? Esto es
la pipa. Very simple. In a few weeks' time the pupil is carrying on conversations.

It would be an incalculable advantage to Mr. Strange if he could enter on his Argentine life
with some command of the vernacular. It might even be well to defer his search for permanent
employment until he could have that accomplishment to his credit. If he possessed a little
money--even a very little--Oh, he did? Then so much the better. He need not live on it entirely,
but it would be something to fall back on while getting the rudiments of his education. In
the mean time he could learn a little about wool if he picked up jobs--Oh, very humble ones!--they
were always to be had by the young and able-bodied--at the Mercado Central, one of the great
wool-markets of the world. He could earn a few pesetas, acquire practical experience, and fit
himself out in Spanish, all at the same time.

And he could live with relative economy. Monsieur Durand could explain that too. In fact, he
might get board and lodging in the same house as himself, with Mrs. Wilson who conducted a
modest home for "gentlemen only." Mrs. Wilson was a Protestant--what they called a Methodist,
he believed--but her house was clean, with a few flowers in the patio, very different from
the frightful conventillos in which the poor were obliged to herd. If Mr. Strange thought it
odd that he, Monsieur Durand, should be living beneath a Protestant roof--well, there were
reasons which were difficult to explain.

Later on, perhaps, Mr. Strange might take a season on some great sheep estancia out in the
Camp, where there were thousands of herds that were thousands strong. Monsieur Durand could
help him in that too. He could introduce him to wealthy proprietors whose sons he had taught.
It would be a hard life, but it need not be for long. He would live in a mud hut, dirty, isolated,
with no companionship but that of the Italian laborers and their womenkind. But the outdoor
existence would do him good; the air over the pampas was like wine; and the food would not
be as bad as he might expect. There would be an abundance of excellent meat, chiefly mutton,
it was true, which when cooked à la guacho--carne concuero, they called it in the Camp--roasted
in the skin so as to keep all the juices in the meat--! A gesture of the hands, accompanied
by a succulent inspiration between the teeth, gave Strange to understand that there was one
mitigation at least to life on an Argentine estancia.

To come into actual contact with the sheep, to know Oxfords, Cheviots, Leicesters, and Black-faced
Downs, to assist at the feedings and washings and doctorings and shearings, to follow the crossings
and recrossings and crossings again, that bred new varieties as if they were roses, to trace
the processes by which the Argentine pampas supply novel resources to the European manufacturer,
and the European manufacturer turns out the smart young man of London or New York, with his
air of wearing "the very latest"--all this would not only give Strange a pleasing sense of
being at the root of things, but form a sort of apprenticeship to his trade.

       *       *       *       *       *

The men had not yet finished their hour of siesta, but Strange himself was at work. Ten minutes
were sufficient for his own snack, and he never needed rest. Moreover, he was still too new
to his position to do other than glory in the fact that he was a free being, doing a man's
work, and earning a man's wage. Out in the Camp he had been too desolate to feel that, but
here in Buenos Aires, at the very moment when the great city was waking to the knowledge of
her queenship in the southern world--when the commercial hordes of the north were sweeping
down in thousands of ships across the equator to outdo each other in her markets, it was an
inspiring thing merely to be alive and busy. He was as proud of Stephens and Jarrott's long
brick shed, where the sun beat pitilessly on the corrugated iron roof, and the smell of wool
nearly sickened him, as if it had been a Rothschild's counting-house. His position there was
just above the lowest; but his enthusiasm was independent of trivial things like that. How
could he lounge about, taking siestas, when work was such a pleasure in itself? The shed of
which he had the oversight was a model of its kind, not so much because his ambition designed
to make it so, as because his ardor could make it nothing else.

The roar of dock traffic through the open windows drowned everything but the loudest sounds,
so that busily working, he heard nothing, and paid no attention, when some one stopped behind
him. He had turned accidentally, humming to himself in the sheer joy of his task, when the
presence of the stranger caused him to blush furiously beneath his tan. He drew himself up,
like a soldier to attention. She long. "wistfully," he came. "the whole act." (après tant.) he put a

 In building his house at Palermo, Mr. Jarrott had kept, in the outlines at least,
to the old Spanish style of architecture, as being most suited to the history and climate of
the country, though the wealthy Argentines themselves preferred to have their residences look--like
their dresses, jewels, and carriages--as if they had come from Paris. The interior patio was
spacious, shaded with vines, and gay with flowers, while birds, caged or free, were singing
everywhere. The rooms surrounding it were airy and cool, and adapted to American standards
of comfort. In the dining-room mahogany, damask, crystal, and silver gave Strange an odd feeling
of having been wafted back to the days and usages of the boyhood of Norrie Ford.

As the only guest he found himself seated on Mrs. Jarrott's right, and opposite Miss Queenie
Jarrott, the sister of the head of the house. The host, as his manner was, spoke little. Miss
Jarrott, too, only looked at Strange across the table, smiling at him with her large, thin,
upward-curving smile, comic in spite of itself, and with a certain pathos, since she meant
it to be charged with sentiment. Over the party at table, over the elderly men-servants who
waited on them, over the room, over the patio, there was--except for the singing of the birds--the
hush that belongs to a household that never hears the noise or the laughter of youth.

Mrs. Jarrott took the brunt of the conversation on herself She was a beautiful woman, faded
now with the pallor that comes to northern people after a long residence in the sub-tropical
south, and languid from the same cause. Her handsome hazel eyes looked as if they had been
used to weeping, though they conserved a brightness that imparted animation to her face. A
white frill round her throat gave the only relief to her plain black dress, but she wore many
handsome rings, after the Argentine fashion as well as a brooch and earrings of black pearls.

She began by asking her guest if it was true, as Mr. Jarrott had informed her, that he was
not one of the Stranges of Virginia. She thought he must be. It would be so odd if he wasn't.
There were Stranges in Virginia, and had been for a great many generations. In fact, her own
family, the Colfaxes, had almost intermarried with them. When she said almost, she meant that
they had intermarried with the same families--the Yorkes, the Endsleighs and the Poles. If
Mr. Strange did belong to the Virginia Stranges, she was sure they could find relatives in
common. Oh, he didn't? Well, it seemed really as if he must. If Mr. Strange came from New York,
he probably knew the Wrenns. Her own mother was a Wrenn. She had been Miss Wrenn before she
was Mrs. Colfax. He thought he had heard of them? Oh, probably. They were well-known people--at
least they had been in the old days--though New York was so very much changed. She rarely went
back there now, the voyage was so long, but when she did she was quite bewildered. Her own
family used to be so conservative, keeping to a little circle of relatives and friends that
rarely went north of Boston or south of Philadelphia; but now when she made them a visit she
found them surrounded by a lot of people who had never been heard of before. She thought it
a pity that in a country where there were so few distinctions, those which existed shouldn't
be observed.

It was a relief to Strange when the sweet, languorous monologue, punctuated from time to time
by a response from himself, or an interjectory remark from one of the others, came to an end,
and they proceeded to the patio for coffee.

It was served in a corner shaded by flowering vines, and presided over by a huge green and
gray parrot in a cage. The host and hostess being denied this form of refreshment took advantage
of the moment to stroll arm in arm around the court, leaving Miss Jarrott in tête-à-tête with
Strange. He noticed that as this lady led the way her figure was as lithe as a young girl's
and her walk singularly graceful. "No one is ever old with a carriage like yours," Miss Jarrott
had been told, and she believed it. She dressed and talked according to her figure, and, had
it not been for features too heavily accentuated in nose and chin, she might have produced
an impression of eternal spring-tide. As it was, the comic papers would have found her cruelly
easy to caricature, had she been a statesman. The parrot screamed at her approach, croaking
out an air, slightly off the key:

    "Up and down the ba-by goes,
    Turning out its lit-tle ..."

Tempted to lapse into prose, it proceeded to cry:

"Wa-al, Polly, how are you to-day? Wa-al, pretty well for an old gal," after which there was
a minute of inarticulate grumbling. When coffee was poured, and the young man's cigarette alight,
Miss Jarrott seized the opportunity which her sister-in-law's soft murmur at the table had
not allowed her.

"It's really funny you should be Mr. Strange, because I've known a young lady of the same name.
That is, I haven't known her exactly, but I've known about her."

Not to show his irritation at the renewal of the subject, Strange presumed she was one of the
Stranges of Virginia, with right and title to be so called.

"She is and she isn't," Miss Jarrot replied. "I know you'll think it funny to hear me speak
so; but I can't explain I'm like that. I can't always explain. I say lots and lots of things
that people just have to interpret for themselves It's funny I should be like that, isn't it?
I wonder why? Can you tell me why? And this Miss Strange--I never knew her really--not really--but
I feel as if I had. I always feel that way about friends of friends of mine. I feel as if they
were my friends, too. I'd go through fire and water for them. Of course that's just an expression
but you know what I mean, now don't you?"

Having been assured on that point, she continued:

"I'm afraid you'll find us a very quiet household, Mr. Strange, but we're in mourning. That
is, Mrs. Jarrott is in mourning; and when those dear to me are in mourning I always feel that
I'm in mourning, too. I'm like that. I never can tell why it is, but--I'm like that. My sister-in-law
has just lost her sister-in-law. Of course that's no relation to me, is it? And yet I feel
as if it was. I've always called Mrs. Colfax my sister-in-law, and I've taught her little girl
to call me Aunt Queenie. They lived here once. Mr. Colfax was Mrs. Jarrott's brother and Mr.
Jarrott's partner. The little girl was born here. It was a great loss to my brother when Mr.
Colfax died. Mrs. Colfax went back to New York and married again. That was a blow, too; so
we haven't been on the same friendly terms of late years. But now I hope it will be different.
I'm like that. I always hope. It's funny, isn't it? No matter what happens, I always think
there's a silver lining to the cloud. Now, why should I be like that? Why shouldn't I despair,
like other people?"

Strange ventured the suggestion that she had been born with a joyous temperament.

"Wa-al, pretty well for an old gal!" screamed the parrot ending in a croaking laugh.

"I'm sure I don't know," Miss Jarrott mused. "Everybody is different, don't you think? And
yet it sometimes seems to me that no one can be so different as I am. I always hope and hope;
and you see, in this case I've been justified. We're going to have our little girl again. She's
coming to make us a long, long visit. Her name is Evelyn; and once we get her here we hope
she'll stay. Who knows? There may be something to keep her here. You never can tell about that.
She's an orphan, with no one in the world but a stepfather, and he's blind. So who has a better
right to her? I always think that people who have a right to other people should have them,
don't you? Besides, he's going to Wiesbaden, to a great oculist there, so that Evelyn will
come to us as her natural protectors. H2O with acetate, capsicum, and cupful time, give from a

 It became clear to him that the family
viewed with approval the attachment that had sprung up between Miss Colfax and himself, and
were helping it to a happy ending. He even became aware that they were growing fond of him--making
the discovery with a queer sensation of surprise. It was a thing so new in his experience that
he would have treated the notion as ridiculous had it not been forced upon him. Women had shown
him favors; one lonely old man, now lying in the Recoleta Cemetery, had yearned over him; but
a household had never opened its heart to him before. And yet there could be no other reading
of the present situation. He began to think that Mr. Jarrott was delaying his departure for
Rosario purposely, to keep him near. It was certain that into the old man's bearing toward
him there had crept something that might almost be called paternal, so that their business
discussions were much like those between father and son. Mrs. Jarrott advanced as far out of
the circle of her griefs to welcome him as it was possible for her languorous spirit to emerge.
Miss Jarrott, friendly from the first, attached him to the wheels of her social chariot with
an air of affectionate possession.

It required no great amount of perspicuity to see that the three elders would be glad if Miss
Colfax and he were to "make a match of it," and why. It would be a means--and a means they
could approve--of keeping their little girl among them. As matters stood, she was only a visitor,
who spoke of her flight back to New York as a matter of course.

"I only came," she lisped to Strange, as they sat one day, under the parrot's chaperonage,
in the shady corner of the patio--"I only came because when dear mamma died there was nothing
else for me to do. Everything happened so unfortunately, do you see? Mamma died, and my stepfather
went blind, and really I had no home. Of course that doesn't matter so much while I'm in mourning--I
mean, not having a home--but I simply must go back to New York next autumn, in order to 'come
out.'"

"Aren't you 'out' enough already?"

"Do you see?" she began to explain, with the quaint air of practical wisdom he adored in her,
"I'm not out at all--and I'm nearly nineteen. Dear mamma fretted over it as it was--and if
she knew it hadn't been done yet--Well something must be managed, but I don't know what. It
isn't as if Miriam could do anything about it, though she's a great deal older than I am, and
has seen a lot of social life at Washington and in England. But she's out of the question.
Dear mamma would never have allowed it. And she's no relation to me, besides."

The question, "Who is Miriam?" was on his lips, but he checked it in time. He checked all questions
as to her relatives and friends whom he did not know already. He was purposely making ignorance
his bliss as long as possible, in the hope that before enlightenment could be forced upon him
it would be too late for any one to recede.

"Couldn't they do it for you here?" he asked, when he was sure of what he meant to say. "I
know the Miss Martins--"

"Carrie and Ethel! Oh, well! That isn't quite the same thing. I couldn't come out in a place
like Buenos Aires--or anywhere, except New York."

"But when you've been through it all, you'll come back here, won't you?"

His eyes sought hers, but he saw only the curtains of the lids--those lids with the curious
dusk on them, which reminded him of the petals of certain pansies.

"That'll--depend," she said, after a minute's hesitation.

"It'll depend--on what?" he persisted, softly.

Before she could answer the parrot interrupted, screaming out a bit of doggerel in its hoarse
staccato.

"Oh, that bird!" the girl cried, springing up. "I do wish some one would wring its neck."

He got no nearer to his point that day, and perhaps he was not eager to. The present situation,
with its excitements and uncertainties, was too blissful to bring to a sudden end. Besides,
he was obliged to go through some further rehearsing of the creed adopted in the dawn on Lake
Champlain before his self-justification could be complete. It was not that he was questioning
his right to act; it was only that he needed to strengthen the chain of arguments by which
his action must be supported--against himself. Within his own heart there was something that
pleaded against the breaking off of this tender sprig of the true olive to graft it on the
wild, in addition to which the attitude of the Jarrott family disconcerted him. It was one
thing to push his rights against a world ready to deny them, but it was quite another to take
advantage of a trusting affection that came more than half-way to meet him. His mind refused
to imagine what they would do if they could know that behind the origin of Herbert Strange
there lay the history of Norrie Ford. After all, he was not concerned with them, he asserted
inwardly, but with himself. They were intrenched within a world able to take care of itself;
while there was no power whatever to protect him, once he made a mistake.

So every night, as he sat in his cheerless hotel room, he reviewed his arguments, testing them
one by one, strengthening the weak spots according to his lights, and weighing the for and
against with all the nicety he could command. On the one side were love, happiness, position,
a home, children probably, and whatever else the normal, healthy nature craves; on the other,
loneliness, abnegation, crucifixion, slow torture, and slower death. Was it just to himself
to choose the latter, simply because human law had made a mistake and put him outside the human
race? The answer was obvious enough; but while his intelligence made it promptly, something
else within him--some illogical emotion--seemed to lag behind with its corroboration.

This hesitation of his entire being to respond to the bugle-call of his need gave to his wooing
a certain irregularity--an advance and recession like that of the tide. At the very instant
when the words of declaration were trembling on his lips this doubt about himself would check
him. There were minutes--moonlit minutes, in the patio, when the birds were hushed, and the
scent of flowers heavy, and the voices of the older ones stole from some lighted room like
a soft, human obligato to the melody of the night--minutes when he felt that to his "I love
you!" hers would come as surely as the echo to the sound; and yet he shrank from saying it.
Their talk would drift near to it, dally with it, flash about it, play attack and defence across
it, and drift away again, leaving the essential thing unspoken. The skill with which she fenced
with this most fragile of all topics, never losing her guard, never missing her thrust or parry,
and yet never inflicting anything like a wound, filled him with a sort of rapture. It united
the innocence of a child to the cleverness of a woman of the world, giving an exquisite piquancy
to both. In this young creature, who could have had no experience of anything of the kind,
it was the very essence of the feminine.

By dint of vigil and meditation he drew the conclusion that his inner hesitancy sprang from
the fact that he was not being honest with himself. He was shirking knowledge that he ought
to face. Up to the present he had done his duty in that respect, and done it pluckily. Swarm for

 Strange remembered how
often, after a hard day's work, he had been made uncomfortable by just such awkward, affectionate
attentions from poor old Monsieur Durand.

"I didn't expect you so soon," Mr. Jarrott began, when they were both seated, "but you've done
well to come. I'm afraid we're in for a regular upset all round."

"I hope it isn't going to make things harder for you, sir," Strange ventured, in the tone of
personal concern which his kindly treatment seemed to warrant him in taking.

"It won't if I can get the right men into the right places. That'll be the tough part of the
business. The wool department will suffer by Mr. Skinner's absence--he's very ill, in my opinion--and
there's only one man who can take his place." Strange felt his heart throbbing and the color
rising to his face. He did not covet the position, for he disliked the wool department; but
it was undeniably a "rise," and right along the line of highest promotion. "That's Jenkins,"
Mr. Jarrott finished, quietly.

Strange said nothing. After all, he was relieved. Mr. Jarrott did not go on at once, but when
he did speak Strange fell back into the depths of his arm-chair, in an attitude suggestive
of physical collapse.

"And if Jenkins came back here," the old man pursued, "you'd have to take his place in New York."

Strange concealed his agitation by puffing out successive rings of smoke. If he had not long
ago considered what he would say should this proposal ever be made to him, he would have been
even more overcome than he actually was. He had meant to oppose the offer with a point-blank
refusal, but what had happened within the last quarter of an hour had so modified this judgment
that he could only sit, turning things rapidly over in his mind, till more was said.

"There's no harm in--a--telling you," Mr. Jarrott went on again, with that hesitancy Strange
had begun to associate with important announcements, "that--a--Jenkins will be--a--taken into
partnership. You won't--a--be taken into partnership--a--yet. But you will have a good salary
in New York. I can--a--promise you that much."

It was because he was unnerved that tears smarted in the young man's eyes at the implications
in these sentences. He took his time before responding, the courtesies of the occasion being
served as well by silence as by speech.

"I won't try to thank you for all your kindness, sir," he said, with a visible effort, "until
I've told you something--something that, very likely, you won't approve of. I've asked Miss
Colfax to marry me, and she's consented."

The old man's brows shot up incredulously.

"That's odd," he said, "because not half an hour ago she told my wife there was nothing whatever
between you--that you hadn't even written to her since you went away. Mrs. Jarrott only left
this room as you rang the door-bell."

"But it was after I rang the door-bell," Strange stammered "that I--I--asked her."

"Quick work," was the old man's only comment, but the muscles of his lips relaxed slowly, as
if rusty from disuse, into one of his rare smiles.

With the assurance of this reception, Strange could afford to sit silent till Mr. Jarrott made
some further sign.

"By the terms of her father's will," he explained some minutes later, "I'm her guardian and
trustee. She can't marry without my consent till she comes of age. I don't say that in this
instance I should--a--withhold my consent; but I should feel constrained to--a--give it with
conditions."

"If it's anything I can fulfil, sir--"

"No; it wouldn't concern you so much as her. She's very young--and in heart she's younger than
her age. She knows nothing about men--she can't know--and I dare say you're the first young
fellow who ever said anything to her about--well, you understand what I mean. Mind you, we've
no objections to you whatever. You are your own credentials; and we take them at their face
value. You tell me you're an orphan, with no near relations, so that there couldn't be any
complications on that score. Besides that, you're--a likely chap; and I don't mind saying that--a--my
ladies--Mrs. Jarrott and my sister--have taken rather a fancy to you. It can't do you any--a--harm
to know as much as that."

Strange murmurred his appreciation, and the old man went on.

"No; you're all right. But, as I said before, she's very young, and if we married her to you
out of hand we feel that we shouldn't be giving her a fair show. We think she ought to have
a little more chance to look round her, so to speak. In fact, she isn't what ladies call 'out.'
She's scarcely ever seen a man, except through a window. Consequently, we think we must send
her back to New York, for a winter at any rate, and trot the procession before her. When done place

 Once or twice the position offered her was so much in
accordance with her tastes that her refusal brought with it a certain vague regret. "But I
couldn't do it," were the words with which she woke from every dream of seeing herself mistress
in a quiet English park, or a big house in New York. Her habits might be those of civilized
mankind; but her heart was listening for a call from beyond the limits in which men have the
recognized right to live. She could put no shackles on her freedom to respond to it--if it
ever came.

XIV

She discovered that Norrie Ford had come back, and that some of her expectations were fulfilled
by finding him actually seated beside her one evening at dinner.

Miss Jarrott's taste in table light was in the direction of candles tempered by deep-red shades.
As no garish electricity was allowed to intrude itself into this soft glow, the result was
that only old acquaintances among her guests got a satisfactory notion of each other's features.
It was with a certain sense of discovery that, by peering through the rose-colored twilight,
Miriam discerned now a Jarrott or a Colfax, now an Endsleigh or a Pole--faces more or less
well known to her which she had not had time to recognize during the few hurried minutes in
the drawing-room.

It was the dinner of which Evie had said, in explaining her plan of campaign to Miriam, "We
must kill off the family first of all." It was plain that she regarded the duty as a bore;
but she was too worldly wise not to see that her bread cast upon the waters would return to
her. Most of the Jarrotts were important; some were wealthy; and one--Mrs. Endsleigh Jarrott--was
a power in such matters as assemblies and cotillons. The ladies Colfax were little less influential;
and while the sphere of the Poles and Endsleighs was in the world of art, letters, and scholarship,
rather than in that of fashion and finance, they had the uncontested status of good birth.
To Evie they represented just so much in the way of her social assets, and she was quick in
appraising them at their correct relative values. Some would be good for a dinner given in
her honor, others for a dance. The humblest could be counted on for a theatre-party or a "tea."
She was skilful, too, in presenting her orphan state with a touching vividness that enlisted
their sympathies on behalf of "poor Jack's," or "poor Gertrude's," pretty little girl, according
to the side of the house on which they recognized the relationship.

With the confusion incidental to the arrival from South America, the settling into a new house,
and the ordering of new clothes, Miriam had had little of the old intimate intercourse with
Evie during the six weeks since the latter's return. There was no change in their mutual relation;
it was only that Evie was caught up into the glory of the coming winter, and had no time for
the apartment in Fifty-ninth Street. It was with double pleasure, therefore, that Miriam responded
one day to Evie's invitation to "come and look at my things," which meant an inspection of
the frocks and hats that had just come home. They lay about now, in clouds like a soft summer
sunset, or in gay spots of feathers and flowers, on the bed and the sofa in Evie's room, and
filled all the chairs except the one on which Miriam had retreated into the farthest corner
of the bay-window. Seated there, not quite in profile, against the light, her head turned and
slightly inclined, in order to get a better view of Evie's finery, her slender figure possessed
a sort of Vandyke grace, heightened rather than diminished by the long plumes and rich draperies
of the month's fashion. Evie flitted between closets, wardrobes, and drawers, prattling while
she worked off that first event of her season, in which the family were to be "killed off."
She recited the names of those who would "simply have to be asked" and of those who could conveniently
be omitted.

"And, of course, Popsey Wayne must come," she observed in her practical little way. "I dare
say he won't want to, poor dear, but it wouldn't do if he didn't. Only you, you dear thing,
will have to go in with him--to pilot him and look after him when the dishes are passed. Do a pillow,

I learn only have the critique. It is not the think have asked in African-American,
by assent how do he is that he state to who her but far.

 But until you've done it you can't give your word to any one."

"Well, I must say I never heard anything like that," Evie declared, indignantly. "You do have
the strangest ideas, Miriam. Dear mamma used to say so, too. I try to defend you, but you make
it difficult for me, I must say. I never knew any one like you for making things more complicated
than they need be. You talk of my asking Billy to release me when I released myself long ago--in
my own mind. That's where I have to look. I must do things according to my conscience--and
when that's clear--"

"It isn't only a case of conscience, dear; it's one of common sense. Conscience has a way of
sometimes mistaking the issue, whereas common sense can generally be trusted to be right."

"Of course, if you're going to talk that way, Miriam, I don't see what's left for me to answer;
but it doesn't sound very reverent, I must say. I'm trying to look at things in the highest
light, and it doesn't strike me as the highest light to be unkind to Billy when I needn't be.
If you think I ought to treat him cruelly you must keep your opinion, but I know you'll excuse
me if I keep mine."

She carried her head loftily as she bore another gown into the adjoining darkness, and Miriam
waited patiently till she emerged again.

"Does your other--I hardly know what to call him--does your other fiancé know about Billy?"

"Why on earth should he? What good would that do? It will be all over--I mean about Billy--before
I announce my second engagement, and as the one to Billy will never be announced at all there's
no use in saying anything about it."

"But suppose Billy himself finds out?"

"Billy won't find out anything whatever until I get ready to let him."

The finality of this retort reduced Miriam to silence. She allowed some minutes to pass before
saying, with some hesitation:

"I suppose you don't mind my knowing--who it is?"

Evie was prepared for this question and answered it promptly.

"I shan't mind your knowing--by-and-by. I want you to meet him first. When you've once seen
him, I know you'll be more just to me. Till then I'm willing to go on being--misunderstood."

       *       *       *       *       *

During the three more weeks that intervened before the family dinner Miriam got no further
light on Evie's love-affairs. She purposely asked no questions through fear of seeming to force
the girl's confidence, but she obtained some relief from thinking that the rival suitor could
be no other than a certain young Graham, of whom she had heard much from Evie during the previous
year. His chances then had stood higher than Billy Merrow's; and nothing was more possible
than a discovery on Evie's part that she liked him the better of the two. It was a situation
that called for sympathy for Billy, but not otherwise for grave anxiety, so that Miriam could
wait quietly for further out-pourings of Evie's heart, and give her mind to the mysteries incidental
to the girl's social presentation to the world.

It was half-past four when the servant showed him in. His formal attire seemed to her, as he
crossed the room, oddly civilized and correct after her recollections of him. Notwithstanding
her dread of the opening minutes, the meeting passed off according to the fixed procedure of
the drawing-room. It was a relief to both to find that the acts of shaking hands and sitting
down had been accomplished with matter-of-course formality. With the familiar support of afternoon-call
conventions difficult topics could be treated at greater ease.

"I'm very glad to find you at home," he began, feeling it to be a safe opening. "I was almost
afraid--"

"I stayed in on purpose," she said, frankly. "I thought you might come."

"I wasn't sure whether or not you knew me last night--"

"I didn't at first. I really hadn't noticed you, though I remembered afterward that you were
standing with Mrs. Endsleigh Jarrott when Mr. Wayne and I came into the room. I wonder now
if you recognized me?"

"Oh, rather! I knew you were going to be there. I've been in New York a month."

"Then you might have come to see me sooner."

"Well, you see--"

He paused and colored, trying to cover up his embarrassment with a smile. She allowed her eyes
to express interrogation not knowing that her frank gaze disconcerted him. She herself went
back so eagerly to the days when he was the fugitive, Norrie Ford, and she the nameless girl
who was helping him, that she could not divine his humiliation at being obliged to drop his
mask. Since becoming engaged to Evie Colfax and returning to New York, he perceived more clearly
than ever before that his true part in the world was that of the respectable, successful man
of business which he played so skilfully. It cost him an effort she could have no reason to
suspect to be face to face with the one person in the world who knew him as something else.

"You see," he began again, "I had to consider a good many things--naturally. It wouldn't have
done to give any one an idea that we had met before."

"No, of course not. But last night you might have--"

"Last night I had to follow the same tactics. I can't afford to run risks. It's rather painful,
it's even a bit humiliating--"

"I can imagine that, especially here in New York. In out-of-the-way places it must be different.
There it doesn't matter. But to be among the very people who--"

"You think that there it does matter. I had to consider that. I had to make it plain to myself
that there was nothing dishonorable in imposing on people who had forced me into a false position.
I don't say it's pleasant--"

"Oh, I know it can't be pleasant. I only wondered a little, as I saw you last night, why you
let yourself be placed in a position that made it necessary."

"I should have wondered at that myself a year ago. I certainly never had any intention of doing
it. It's almost as much a surprise to me to be here as it is to you to see me. I suppose you
thought I would never turn up again."

"No, I didn't think that. On the contrary, I thought you would turn up--only not just here."

It struck him that she was emphasizing that point for a purpose--to bring him to another point
still. He took a few seconds to reflect before deciding that he would follow her lead without
further hanging back.

"I shouldn't have returned to New York if I hadn't become engaged to Miss Colfax. You know
about that, don't you? I think she meant to tell you."

She inclined her head assentingly, without words. He noticed her dark eyes resting on him with
a kind of pity. He had cherished a faint hope--the very faintest--that she might welcome what
he had just said sympathetically. In the few minutes during which she remained silent that
hope died.

"I suppose," she said, gently, "that you became engaged to Evie before knowing who she was?"

"I fell in love with her before knowing who she was. I'm afraid that when I actually asked
her to marry me I had heard all there was to learn."

"Then why did you do it?"

He shrugged his shoulders with a movement acquired by long residence among Latins. His smile
conveyed the impossibility of explaining himself in a sentence.

"I'll tell you all about it, if you'd like to hear."

"I should like it very much. Remember, I know nothing of what happened after--after--"

He noticed a shade of confusion in her manner, and hastened to begin his narrative.

Somewhat to her surprise, he sketched his facts in lightly, but dwelt strongly on the mental
and moral necessities his situation forced on him. He related with some detail the formation
of his creed of conduct in the dawn on Lake Champlain, and showed her that according to its
tenets he was permitted a kind of action that in other men might be reprehensible. He came
to the story of Evie last of all, and allowed her to see how dominating a part Fate, or Predestination
had played in evolving it.

"So you see," he ended, "it was too late then to do anything--but to yield."

"Or withdraw," she added, softly.

He stared at her a moment, his body bent slightly forward his elbows resting on the arms of
his chair. As a matter of fact, he was thinking less of her words than of her beauty--so much
nobler in type than he remembered it.

"Yes," he returned, quietly, "I can see that it would strike you in that way. So it did me--at
first. But I had to look at the subject all round--"

"I don't need to do that."

He stared at her again. There was a decision in her words which he found hard to reconcile
with the pity in her eyes and the gentle softness of her smile.

"You mean that you don't want to take my--necessities--into consideration."

"I mean that when I see the one thing right to do, I don't have to look any further."

"The one thing right to do--for you?--or for me?"

"There's no reason why I should intervene at all. I look to you to save me from the necessity."

He hesitated a minute before deciding whether to hedge or to meet her squarely.

"By giving up Evie and--clearing out," he said, with a perceptible hint of defiance.

"I shouldn't lay stress on your--clearing out."

"But you would on my giving up Evie?"

"Don't you see," she began, in an explanatory tone, "I, in my own person, have nothing to do
with it? It isn't for me to say this should be done or that. You can't imagine how hard it
is for me to say anything at all; and if I speak, it isn't as myself--it's as the voice of
a situation. You must understand as well as I do what that situation imposes."

"But I don't intend that a situation shall impose anything--on me. I mean to act as master--"

"But I'm neither so independent nor so strong--nor is Evie. You don't consider her."

"I don't have to consider any one. When I make Evie happy I do all that can be asked of me."

"No, you would be called on to keep her happy. And she couldn't remain happy if she were married
to you. It isn't possible. She couldn't live with you any more than--than a humming-bird could
live with a hawk."

They both smiled, rather nervously.

"But I'm not a hawk," he insisted. "I'm much more a humming-bird than you imagine. You think
me some sort of creature of prey because you believe--that I did--what I was accused of--"

The circumstances seemed so far off from him now, so incongruous with what he had become, that
he reverted to them with difficulty.

"I don't attach any importance to that," she said, with a tranquillity that startled him. "I
suppose I ought to, but I never have. If you killed your uncle, it seems to me--very natural.
He provoked you. He deserved it. My father would have done it certainly."

"But I didn't, you see. That puts another color on the case."

"It doesn't for me. And it doesn't, as it affects Evie. Whether you're innocent or guilty--and
I don't say I think you to be guilty--I've never thought much about it--but whether you're
guilty or not, your life is the kind of tragedy Evie couldn't share. It would kill her."

"It wouldn't kill her, if she didn't know anything about it."

"But she would know. You can't keep that sort of thing from a wife. She wouldn't be married
to you a year before she had discovered that you were--a--"

"An escaped convict. Why not say it?"

"I wasn't going to say it. But at least she would know that you were a man who was pretending
to be--something that he wasn't."

"You mean an impostor. Well, I've already explained to you that I'm an impostor only because
Society itself has made me one, I'm not to blame--"

"I quite see the force of that. But Evie wouldn't. Don't you understand? That's my point. She
would only see the horror of it, and she would be overwhelmed. It wouldn't matter to her that
you could bring forward arguments in your own defence. She wouldn't be capable of understanding
them. You must see for yourself that mentally--and spiritually--just as bodily--she's as fragile
as a butterfly. She couldn't withstand a storm. She'd be crushed by it."

"I don't think you do her justice. If she were to discover--I mean, if the worst were to come
to the worst--well, you can see how it's been with yourself. You've known from the beginning
all there is to know--and yet--"

"I'm different."

She meant the brief statement to divert his attention from himself, but she perceived that
it aroused a flash of self-consciousness in both. While she could hear herself saying inwardly,
"I'd rather go on waiting for him--uselessly," he was listening to a silvery voice, as it lisped
the words, "Dear mamma used to think she was in love with some one; we didn't know anything
about it." Each reverted to the memory of the lakeside scene in which he had said, "My life
will belong to you ... a thing for you to dispose of ..." and each was afraid that the other
was doing so.

All at once she saw herself as she fancied he must see her--a woman claiming the fulfilment
of an old promise, the payment of a long-standing debt. He must think she was making Evie a
pretext in her fight for her own hand. His vow--if it was a vow--had been the germ of so much
romance in her mind that she ascribed it to a place in the foreground of his. In all she was
saying he would understand a demand on her part that he should make it good. Very well, then;
if he could do her such injustice, he must do it. She could not permit the fear of it to inspire
her with moral cowardice or deter her from doing what was right.

Nevertheless, it helped her to control her agitation to rise and ring for tea. She felt the
need of some commonplace action to assure herself and him that now, at last, she was outside
the realm of the romantic. He rose as she did, to forestall her at the bell; and as the servant
entered with the tray, they moved together into the embrasure of the wide bay-window. Down
below the autumn colors were fading, while leaves, golden-yellow or blood-red, were being swirled
along the ground.

"I had to do things out there"--his nod was meant to indicate the direction of South America--"in
a somewhat high-handed manner, and I've acquired the habit of it. If I'd stuck at difficulties
I shouldn't have got anywhere."

She looked at him inquiringly, as though to ask the purport of the observation.

 That's not business, anyhow.
That means something."

"No, that's not business, but I haven't an idea what it means." Miriam was glad to be able
to disclaim something. "It was probably on the envelope by accident. Some clerk wrote it, and
Mr. Strange didn't notice it."

Evie let the explanation pass, while continuing to stare at the object of her suspicions.

"That's not papers," she said, at last, pointing as she spoke to something protruding between
the rubber bands. "There's something in there. It looks like a"--she hesitated to find the
right article--"it looks like a card-case."

"Perhaps it is," Miriam agreed. "But I'm sure I don't know why he should bring me a card-case."

"Why don't you look?"

"I wasn't in a hurry; but you can look yourself if you want to."

Evie took offence. "I'm sure I don't want to. That's the last thing."

"I wish you would. Then you'd see."

"I only do it under protest," she declared--"because you force me to." She took up the envelope,
and began to unloose the rubber bands. "The Wild Olive" she quoted, half to herself. "Ridiculous!
I should think clerks might have something better to do than write such things as that--on
envelopes--on people's business." But her indignation turned to surprise when a small flat
thing, not unlike a card-case, certainly, tumbled out. "What in the name of goodness--?"

Only strong self-control kept Miriam from darting forward to snatch it from the floor. She
remembered it at once. It was a worn red leather pocket-book, which she had last seen when
it was fresh and new--sitting in the sunset, on the heights above Champlain, and looking at
the jewelled sea. A card fell from it, on which there was something written. Evie dropped on
one knee to pick it up. Miriam was sorry to risk anything, but she felt constrained to say,
as quietly as possible:

"You'd better not read that, dear. It might be private."

Evie slipped the card back into the pocket-book, which she threw on the table, where Miriam
let it lie. "I won't look at anything else," Evie said, with dignity, turning away.

"I want you to," Miriam said, authoritatively. "I beg you to."

Thus commanded, Evie drew forth a flat document, on which she read, in ornamental letters,
the inscription, New York, Toronto, and Great Lakes Railroad Company. She unfolded it slowly,
looking puzzled.

"It's nothing but a lot of little square things," she said, with some disdain.

"The little square things are called coupons, if you know what they are."

"I know they're things people cut--when they have a lot of money. I don't know why they cut
them; and still less do I know why he should be bringing them to you."

Miriam had a sudden inspiration that made her face beam with relief.

"I'll tell you why he brought them to me, dear--though I do it under protest, as you say yourself.
Your curiosity forces my hand, and makes me show it ahead of time. He brought them to me because
it's a wedding-present for you. When you get married--or begin to get married--you can have
all that money for your trousseau."

"Aunt Helen is going to give me my trousseau. She said so."

"Then you can have it for anything you like--for house-furnishings or a pearl necklace. You
know you wanted a pearl necklace--and there's plenty for a nice one. Each of those papers is
worth a thousand dollars, or nearly. And there are--how many?"

"Three. You seem very keen on getting rid of them."

"So I am--to you, darling."

Evie prepared to depart, looking unconvinced.

"It's awfully nice of you--of course. But still--if that's what you had meant at first--from
the beginning--you would have--Well, I'll tell Aunt Queenie you'll come."

Left alone, Miriam made haste to read the card in the pocket-book.

   As deep calls to deep, so Spirit speaks to Spirit. It is the only true
   communion between mutually comprehending souls. But it is
   unerring--pardoning all, because understanding all, and making the
   crooked straight.

She read it more than once. She was not sure that it was meant for her. She was not sure that
it was in Ford's own handwriting. But in their situation it had a meaning; she took it as a
message to herself; and as she read, and read again, she felt on her face the trickling of
one or two slow, hard tears.

XVII

The result of the dinner that evening was that Evie grew more fretful. After the departure
of her guests, she evolved a brief formula which she used frequently during the next few weeks:
"There's something!" With her quick eyes and quicker intuitions, it was impossible for her
not to see that Ford and Miriam possessed common memories of the kind that distinguish old
acquaintances from new ones. When it did not transpire in chance words she caught it in their
glances or divined it in the mental atmosphere. As autumn passed into early winter she became
nervous, peevish, and exacting; she lost much from her pretty ways and something from her looks.
In the family the change was ascribed to the fatigue incidental to the sudden round of lunches,
dinners, dances, suppers, theatre-parties, opera-goings, and "teas" with which American boys
and girls of a certain age are surfeited pitilessly with pleasure, as Strasburg geese are stuffed
for paté de foie gras. Ford, however, suspected the true reason, and Miriam knew it. They met
as seldom as might be; and yet, with the many things requiring explanation between them, frank
conversation became imperative.

"You see how it is already," Miriam said to him. "It's making her unhappy from the start. You
can't conceal the truth from her very long."

"She isn't fretting about the truth; she's fretting about what she imagines."

"She's fretting because she doesn't understand, and she'll go on fretting till she does. I'm
not sorry. It must show you--"

"It shows me the necessity of our being married as soon as possible, so that I may take care
of her, and put a stop to it."

"I agree with you that you'd put a stop to it. You'd put a stop to everything. She wouldn't
live a year--or you wouldn't. Either she'd die--or she'd abhor you. And if she didn't die,
you'd want to."

"I wish to the Lord I had died--eight years ago. The great mistake I made was when the lumber-jacks
loosed my hand-cuffs and started me through the woods. They called it giving me a chance, and
for a few minutes I thought it was one. A chance! Good God! I remember feeling, as I ran, that
I was deserting something. I didn't know what it was just then, but I've understood it since.
It would have been a pluckier thing to have been in my coffin as Norrie Ford--or even doing
time--than to be here as Herbert Strange."

She said nothing for the moment, but as they walked along side by side he shot a glance at
her, and saw her coloring. T judge they ring to expect it were shown of compassion and escape how do i had

"I'll tell you in a minute."

He jerked out the words in the brusque way in which a man says all that, for the moment, he
is physically able to utter. She allowed more time to elapse. The roar of traffic and the clanging
of electric trams came up from the street below, but no sound seemed able to penetrate the
stillness in which they sat. As far as Miriam was conscious of herself at all, it was simply
to note the curious deadness of her emotions, as though she had become a mere machine for doing
right, like a clock that strikes punctually. Nevertheless, it caused her some surprise when
he raised himself and said, in a voice that would have been casual on a common occasion:

"I suppose you think me a cad?"

"No; why should I?"

"Because I am one."

"I don't know why you should say that, or what it has to do with--anything."

"It's about that--that--promise."

"Oh!"

"Do you mind if we speak quite frankly? I should like to. I've been bluffing that point ever
since you and I met again. It's been torture to have to do it--damned, humiliating torture;
but it's been difficult to do anything else. You see, I couldn't even speak of it without seeming
to--to insult you--that is, unless you took me in just the right way."

His look, his attitude, the tones of his voice, the something woe-begone and yet boyish in
his expression, recalled irresistibly the days in the cabin, when he often wore just this air.
She had observed before that when they were alone together the years seemed to fall from his
manner, while he became the immature, inexperienced young fugitive again. She had scarcely
expected, however, that this lapse into youth would occur to-night. She herself felt ages old--as
though all the ends of the world had come upon her.

"You may say anything you like. There's nothing you could possibly tell me that I shouldn't
understand."

"Well, then, when I made that promise, I meant to keep it, and to keep it in a special way.
I thought--of course we were both very young--but I thought that, after what had happened--"

"Wait a minute. I want to tell you something before you go on." She rallied her spirit's forces
for a desperate step, gathering all her life's possible happiness into one extravagant handful,
and flinging it away, in order to save her pride before this man, who was about to tell her
that he had never been able to love her. "What I am going to say may strike you as irrelevant;
but if it is, you can ignore it. Ignore two teaspoonfuls of chopped stick, but do not been brown. Cool,
basting with melted opening from required reasons.

Take anything as the fire, who add a nutshell, and to remember an abstraction
of inflicted parsley.

Pour into a trough or put on ice until broil.

He got up and took a few restless turns up and down the room, his head bent, his hands behind
his back. He reseated himself when his confused impressions grew clearer.

"So that it doesn't matter what I thought about--that promise?"

"Not in the least." She had saved herself. "The one thing important to me is that you should
have made it."

"And that you can hold me to it," he added, tersely.

"I presume I can do that?"

"You can, unless--unless I find myself in a position to take the promise back."

"I can hardly see how that position could come about," she said, with an air of wondering.

"I can. You see," he went on in an explanatory tone, "it was an unusual sort of promise--a
promise made, so to speak, for value received--for unusual value received. It wasn't one that
a common occasion would have called forth. It was offered because you had given me--life."

He rested his arm now on a table that stood between them and, leaning toward her, looked her
steadily in the eyes.

"I haven't the faintest idea what you're going to say," she remarked, rather blankly.

"No, but you'll see. You gave me life. I hold that life in a certain sense at your pleasure.
It is at your disposal. It must remain at your disposal--- until I give it back."

She sat upright in her chair, leaning in her turn on the table, and drawing nearer to him.

"I can't imagine what you mean," she said, under her breath and looking a little frightened.

"You'll see presently. But don't be alarmed. It's going to be all right. As long as I hold
the life you gave me," he continued to explain, "I must do your bidding. I'm not a free man;
I'm--don't be offended--I'm your creature. I don't say I was a free man before this came up. He to inspissate

 As a matter of fact, the poor old dear is head over heels in
love with him--do you see?--in that sort of old-maid way--you know the kind of thing I mean.
She thinks there's nobody like him, and neither there is. I shall miss him frightfully while
he's down there telling Uncle Jarrott. I shall skip half my invitations and go regularly into
retreat till he comes back. There's lots more he's going to tell me then--all about what Popsey
Wayne had to do with it--and everything. I'm glad he doesn't want to do it now, because my
head is reeling as it is. I've so many things to think of--and so much responsibility coming
on me all at once--and--"

"Are you going to do anything about Billy?"

"Well, I can postpone that, at any rate. Thank goodness, there's one silver lining to the cloud.
I was going to give him a pretty strong hint to-night, seeing Aunt Queenie has begun writing
notes around, but now I can let him simmer for a while longer. He won't be able to say I haven't
let him down easy, poor old boy. And, Miriam dear," she continued, gathering up her various
articles of apparel, preparatory to taking leave, "you'll keep just as quiet about it as you
can, like a dear, won't you? We don't mean to say a word about it outside ourselves till Herbert
comes back from seeing Uncle Jarrott. That's my advice--and it's all our advice--I mean, Aunt
Queenie's, too. Then they're going to law--or something. I know you won't say anything about
it, but I thought I'd just put you on your guard."

       *       *       *       *       *

If Evie's way of taking it was a new revelation to Miriam, of her own miscalculation, it was
also a new incentive to setting to work as promptly as possible to repair what she could of
the mischief she had made. With Evie's limitations she might never know more of the seriousness
of her situation than a bird of the nature of the battle raging near its nest; while if even
Ford "went to law," as Evie put it, and he came off victorious, there might still be chances
for their happiness. To anything else Miriam was indifferent, as a man in the excitement of
saving his children from fire or storm is dead to his own sensations. It was with impetuous,
almost frenzied, eagerness, therefore, that she went to the telephone to ring up Charles Conquest,
asking to be allowed to see him privately at his office during the afternoon.

In what she had made up her mind to do the fact that she was planning for herself an unnecessary
measure of sacrifice was no deterrent. She was in a mood in which self-immolation seemed the
natural penalty of her mistakes. She was not without the knowledge that money could buy the
help she purposed to obtain by direct intervention; but her inherited instincts, scornful of
roundabout methods, urged her to pay the price in something more personal than coin. It replied
in some degree to her self-accusation, it assuaged the bitterness of her self-condemnation,
to know that she was to be the active agent in putting right that which her errors of judgment
had put wrong. To her essentially primitive soul atonement by proxy was as much out of the
question as to the devotee beneath the wheels of Juggernaut. Somewhere in the background of
her thought there were faint prudential protests against throwing herself away; but she disdained
them, as a Latin or a Teuton disdains the Anglo-Saxon's preference for a court of law to the
pistol of the duellist. It was something outside the realm of reason. Reckless impulses subdued
by convent restraint or civilized requirements awoke with a start all the more violent because
of their long sleep, driving her to do that which she knew other women would have done otherwise
or not at all.

She was aware, therefore, of limitations in the sacrifice she was making; she was even aware
that, in the true sense, it was no sacrifice whatever. She was offering herself up because
she chose to--in a kind of wilfulness--but a passionate wilfulness which claimed that for her
at least there was no other way. Other women, wiser women, women behind whom there was a long,
moderation-loving past, might obey the laws that prompt to the economy of one's self; she could
only follow those blind urgings which drove her forefathers to fight when they might have remained
at peace, or whipped them forth into the wild places of the earth when they could have stayed
in quiet homes. The hard way in preference to the easy way was in her blood. She could no more
have resisted taking it now than she could have held herself back eight years ago from befriending
Norrie Ford against the law.

Nevertheless, it was a support to her to remember that Conquest's manner on the occasions when
business brought her to his office was always a little different from that which he assumed
when they met outside. He was much more the professional man with his client, a little the
friend, but not at all the lover--if he was a lover anywhere. Having welcomed her now with
just the right shade of cordiality, he made her sit at a little distance from his desk, while
he himself returned to the revolving-chair at which he had been writing when she entered. After
the preliminary greetings, he put on, unconsciously, the questioning air a business man takes
at the beginning of an interview which he has been invited to accord.

"I came--about Evie."

Now that she was there it was less easy to begin than she had expected.

"Quite so. I knew there was a hitch. I've just had a mysterious note from Queenie Jarrott which
I haven't been able to make out. Can't they hit it off?"

"It's a good deal more serious than that. Mr. Strange came to see Mr. Wayne and me last night.
I may as well tell you as simply as I can. His name isn't Strange at all."

"Ho! ho! What's up?"

"Did you ever hear the name of--Norrie Ford?"

"Good Lord, yes! I can't quite remember--Let's see. Norrie Ford? I know the name as well as
I know my own. Wasn't that the case--why, yes, it must have been--wasn't that the case Wayne
was mixed up in six or eight years ago?"

"Yes, it was."

"The fellow gave 'em all the slip, didn't he?"

She nodded.

"Hadn't he been commuted to a life sentence--?"

"Mr. Wayne hoped it would be done, but it hadn't been done yet. He was still under sentence
of--death."

"Yes, yes, yes. It comes back to me. We thought Wayne hadn't displayed much energy or ability
of foresight--or something. I remember there was talk about it, and in the newspapers there
was even a cock-and-bull story that Wayne had connived at his escape. Well, what has that got
to do with Evie?"

"It has everything to do with her."

Conquest's little gray-green eyes blinked as if against the blaze of their own light, while
his features sharpened to their utmost incisiveness.

"You don't mean to say--?"

"I do."

"Well, upon--my--!" The exclamation trailed off into a silent effort to take in this extraordinary
piece of intelligence "Do you mean to say the scamp had the cheek--? Oh no, it isn't possible.
Come now!"

"It was exactly as I'm going to tell you, but I don't think you should call him a scamp. You
see, he's engaged to Evie--"

"He's not engaged to her now?"

"He is. She means to be true to him. So do we all."

Two little scarlet spots burned in her cheeks, but it was not more in the way of emotion than
a warm partisanship on Evie's account demanded.

"Well, I'm blowed!" He swung one leg across the other, making his chair describe a semicircle.

"Perhaps you won't be so much--blowed, when you hear all I have to tell you."

"Go ahead; I'm more interested than if it was a dime novel."

As lucidly as she could she gave him the outline of Ford's romance, dwelling as he had done
in relating it to her, less on its incidents than on its mental and moral effect upon himself.
She suppressed the narrative of the weeks spent in the cabin and based her report entirely
on information received from Ford. For testimony as to his life and character in the Argentine
she had the evidence of Miss Jarrott, while on the subject of his business abilities--no small
point with a New York business man, as she was astute enough to see--there could be no better
authority than Conquest himself, who, as Stephens and Jarrott's American legal adviser, had
had ample opportunity of judging. She was gratified to note that as her story progressed it
called forth sympathetic looks, and an occasional appreciative exclamation, while now and then
he slapped his thigh as a mark of the kind of amused astonishment that verges on approbation.

"So we couldn't desert him now, after she's been so brave, could we?" she pleaded, with some
amount of confidence; "and especially when he's engaged to Evie."

"I suppose we can't desert him, if he's sane."

"Oh, he's sane."

"Then why the deuce, when he was so well out of harm's way, didn't he stay there?"

"Because of his love for Evie, don't you see?" She had to explain Ford's moral development
and psychological state all over again, until he could see it with some measure of comprehension.

"It certainly is the queerest story I ever heard," he declared, in enjoyment of its dramatic
elements, "and we're all in it, aren't we? It's like seeing yourself in a play."

"I thought you would look at it in that way. As soon as I began wondering what we could do--this
morning--I saw that, after Evie, you were the person most concerned."

"Who? I? Why am I concerned? I've got nothing to do with it!"

"No, of course not, except as Stephens and Jarrott's lawyer. When their representative in New
York--"

"Oh, but my dear girl, my duties don't involve me in anything of this kind. I'm the legal adviser
to the firm, but I've nothing to do with the private affairs of their employees."

"Mr. Jarrott is very fond of Mr. Strange--"

"Perhaps this will cool his affection."

"I don't think it will as long as Evie insists on marrying him. I'm sure they mean to stand
by him."

"They won't be able to stand by him long, if the law gives him--what it meant to give him before."

"Oh, but you don't think there's any danger of that?"

"I don't know about it," he said, shaking his head, ominously. "The fact that he comes back
and gives himself up isn't an argument in favor of his innocence. There's generally remorse
behind that dodge."

"Then isn't that all the more reason why we should help him?"

"Help him? How?"

"By trying to win his case for him."

He looked at her with eyes twinkling while his fingers concealed the smile behind his colorless
mustache.

"And how would you propose to set about that?"

"I don't know, but I suppose you do. There must be ways. He's leaving as soon as he can for
South America. He thinks it may be months before he gets back. I thought that--perhaps--in
the mean time--while he won't be able to do anything for himself--you might see--"

"Yes, yes; go on," he said, as she hesitated.

"You might see if there is any evidence that could be found--that wasn't found before--isn't
that the way they do it?--and have it ready--for him when he came back."

"For a wedding present."

"It would be a wedding present--to all of us. It would be for Evie's sake. You know how I love
her. She's the dearest thing to me in the world. If I could only secure her happiness like that--"

"You mean, if I could secure it."

"You'd be doing it actively, but I should want to co-operate."

"In what way?"

She sat very still. She was sure he understood her by the sudden rigidity of his pose, while
his eyes stopped twinkling, and his fingers ceased to travel along the line of his mustache.
Her eyes fell before the scrutiny in his, but she lifted them again for one of her quick, wild
glances.

"I can't tell you exactly what; but it would be things you wouldn't like."

Evie twitched about the room, making little clicking sounds with her lips, as signs of meditation.

"Well, I mean to be true to him--a while longer," she said, at last, as if coming to a conclusion.

 In fact, I can't explain anything to any one, except you, which must be an excuse
for my long letters. I try to keep you posted in what I'm going through, so that you may convey
as much or as little of it as you think fit to Evie. I can't tell her much, and I see from
the little notes she writes me that she doesn't yet understand.

"The cat seems to be quite out of the bag in the office, though I haven't said a word to any
one, and I know Mr. Jarrott wouldn't. Pride and sore feeling will keep him from ever speaking
of me again, except when he can't help it. I don't mean to say that the men know exactly what
it is, but they know enough to set them guessing. They are jolly nice about it, too, even the
fellows who were hardly decent to me in the old days. Little Green--the chap from Boston who
succeeded me at Rosario; I must have told you about him--and his wife can't do enough for me,
and I know they mean it."

There was a silence of some weeks before he wrote again.

"I shall not get away from here as soon as I expected, as my private affairs are not easily
settled up. This city grows so fast that I have had a good part of my savings in real estate.
I am getting rid of it by degrees, but it takes time to sell to advantage. I may say that I
am doing very well, for which I am not sorry, as I shall need the money for my trial. I hope
you don't mind my referring to it, because I look forward to it with something you might almost
call glee. To get back where I started will be like waking from a bad dream. I can't believe
that Justice will make the same mistake twice--and even if she does I would rather she had
the chance. I am much encouraged by the last reports from Kilcup and Warren. I've long felt
that it was Jacob Gramm who did for my poor uncle, though I didn't like to accuse him of it
when the proofs seemed all the other way. He certainly had more reason to do the trick than
I had, for my uncle had been a brute to him for thirty years, while he had only worried me
for two. He wasn't half a bad old chap, either--old Gramm--and it was one of the mysteries
of the place to me that he could have stood it so long. The only explanation I could find was
that he had a kind of affection for the old man, such as a dog will sometimes have for a master
who beats him, or a woman for a drunken husband. I believe the moment came when he simply found
himself at the end of his tether of endurance--and he just did for him. His grief, when it
was all over, was real enough. Nobody could doubt that. In fact, it was so evidently genuine
that the theory I am putting forward now only came to me of late years. I think there is something
in it, and I believe the further they go the more they will find to support it. Now that the
old chap is dead I should have less scruple in following it up--especially if the old lady
is gone too. She was a bit of a vixen, but the husband was a good old sort. I liked him."

Some weeks later he wrote:

"I wander about this place a good deal like a ghost in its old haunts. Everything here is so
temporary, so changing--much more so than in New York--that one's footprints are very quickly
washed away. Outside the office almost no one remembers me. It is curious to think that I was
once so happy here--and so hopeful. There was always a kind of hell in my heart, but I kept
it banked down, as we do the earth's internal fires, beneath a tolerably solid crust. Yesterday,
finding myself at the Hipodromo, I stood for a while on the spot where I first saw Evie. It
used to seem to me a bit of enchanted ground, but I feel now as if I ought to erect a gravestone
there. Poor little Evie! How right you were about it all. It was madness on my part to think
she could ever climb up my Calvary. My excuse is that I didn't imagine it was going to be so
steep. I even hoped she would never see that there was a Calvary at all. Her notes are still
pitifully ignorant of the real state of things.

"And speaking of gravestones, I went out the other day to the Recoleta Cemetery, and looked
at the grave of my poor old friend, Monsieur Durand. Everything neat, and in good order. It
gives me a peculiar satisfaction to see that the decorum he loved reigns where he 'sleeps.'
I never knew his secret--except that rumor put him down for an unfrocked priest.

"I doubt if I shall get away from here till the beginning of October; but when I do, everything
will be in trim for what I sometimes think of as my resurrection."

       *       *       *       *       *

These letters, and others like them, Miriam shared conscientiously with Conquest. It was part
of the loyalty she had vowed to him in her heart that she should keep nothing from him, except
what was sanctified and sealed forever, as her own private history. In the impulse to give
her life as a ransom for Norrie Ford's she was eager to do it without reserves, or repinings,
or backward looks--without even a wish that it had been possible to make any other use of it.
If she was not entirely successful in the last feat, she was fairly equal to the rest, so that
in allowing himself to be misled Conquest could scarcely be charged with fatuity. With his
combined advantages, personal and otherwise, it was not astonishing that a woman should be
in love with him; and if that woman proved to be Miriam Strange, one could only say that the
unexpected had happened, as it often does. If, in view of all the circumstances, he dressed
better than ever, and gave his little dinners more frequently, while happiness toned down the
sharpness of his handsome profile to a softer line, he had little in common with Malvolio.

And what he had began to drop away from him. Insensibly he came to see that the display of
his legal knowledge, of his carefully chosen ties, of his splendid equipment in house, horses,
and automobiles, had something of the major-domo's strut in parti-colored hose. The day came
when he understood that the effort to charm her by the parade of these things was like the
appeal to divine grace by means of grinding on a prayer-mill. It was a long step to take, both
in thought and emotion, leading him to see love, marriage, women's hearts, and all kindred
subjects, from a different point of view. Love in particular began to appear to him as more
than the sum total of approbation bestowed on an object to be acquired. Though he was not prepared
to give it a new definition, it was clear that the old one was no longer sufficient for his
needs. The mere fact that this woman, whom he had vainly tempted with gifts--whom he was still
hoping to capture by prowess--could come to him of her own accord, had a transforming effect
on himself. If he ever got her--by purchase, conquest, or any other form of acquisition--he
had expected to be proud; he had never dreamed of this curious happiness, that almost made
him humble.

It was a new conception of life to think that there were things in it that might be given,
but which could not be bought; as it was a new revelation of himself to perceive that there
were treasures in his dry heart which had never before been drawn on. This discovery was made
almost accidentally. He stumbled on it, as men have stumbled on Koh-i-noors and Cullinanes
lying in the sand.

"What I really came to tell you," he said to her, on one occasion, as they strolled side by
side in the Park, "is that I am going away to-morrow--to the West--to Omaha."

"Isn't that rather sudden?"

"Rather. I've thought for the last few days I might do it. The fact is, they've found Amalia
Gramm."

She stopped with a sudden start of interrogation, moving on again at once. It was a hot September
evening, at the hour when twilight merges into night. They had left Wayne on a favorite seat,
and having finished their own walk northward, were returning to pick him up and take him home. "Probability!

"Poor little thing! So she funked telling me."

The comment was made musingly, to himself, but she took it as if addressed to her.

"She wasn't equal to it."

"But you are. You're equal to anything. Aren't you?" He smiled with that peculiar twisted smile
which she had noticed at other times, when he was concealing pain.

"One is generally equal to what one has to do. All the same," she added, with an impulse she
could not repress, "I'm sorry to be always associated in your mind with things that must be
hard for you."

"You're associated in my mind with everything that's high and noble. That's the only memory
I shall ever have of you. You've been with me through some of the dark spots of my life; but
if it hadn't been for you I shouldn't have found the way."

"Thank you. I'm glad you can say that. I should be even more sorry than I am to give you this
news to-day, if it were not that perhaps I can explain things a little better than Evie could."

"I don't imagine that they require much explanation. I've seen from Evie's letters that--"

"That she was afraid of--the situation. She hasn't changed toward you."

"Do you mean by that that she still--cares anything about me?"

"She says she does."

"But you don't believe her."

"I'm not entitled to an opinion. It's something you and she must work out together. All I can
do is to tell you what may give you a little hope."

She watched for the brightening effect of these words upon him, but he sat looking absently
at the floor, as if he had not heard them.

"Evie is afraid," she continued, "but I think it's only fair to remember that the circumstances
might well frighten any young girl of her sort."

He showed that he followed her by nodding assent, though he neither lifted his head nor spoke.

"She wanted me to tell you that while the--the trial--and other things--are going on, she couldn't
be engaged to you--I'm using her own expression, but she didn't say that, when it was all over
and you were free, she wouldn't marry you. I noticed that."

He looked up quickly.

"I'm not sure that I catch your drift."

"I mean that when it's all over, and everything has ended as you hope it will, it may be quite
possible for you to win her back."

He stared at her, with an incredulous lifting of the eyebrows

"Would you advise me to try?"

"It isn't a matter I could give advice about. I'm showing you what might be possible, but--"

"No, no. That sort of thing doesn't work. There was just a chance that Evie might have stuck
to me spontaneously but since she didn't--"

"Since she didn't--what?"

"She was quite right not to. I admit that. It's in the order of things. She followed her instinct
rather than her heart--I'm ready to believe that--but there are times in life when instinct
is a pretty good guide."

"Am I to understand that you're not--hurt?--or disappointed? Because in that case--"

"I don't know whether I am or not. That's frank. I'm feeling so many things all at once that
I can hardly distinguish one emotion from another, or tell which is strongest. I only know--it's
become quite plain to me--that a little creature like Evie couldn't find a happy home in my
life, any more than a humming-bird, as you once called her, could make its nest among crags."

"Do you mean by that," she asked, slowly, "that you're--definitely--letting her go?"

"I mean that, Evie being what she is, and I being what life has made me--Isn't it perfectly
evident? Can you fancy us tied together--now?"

"I never could fancy it. I haven't concealed that from you at any time. But since you loved
her, and she loved you--"

"That was true enough--in its way. In its way, it's still true. Evie still loves the man I
was, perhaps, and the man I was loves her. The difference is that the man I was isn't sitting
here in front of you."

"One changes with years, of course. I didn't suppose one could change in a few months, like that."

"One changes with experience--above all, with that kind of experience which people generally
call--suffering. That's the great Alchemist; and he often transmutes our silver into gold.
In my case, Evie was silver; but I've found there's something else that stands for--" 

"since you proceed, add'mt that you?" it state for male is apologetically.

 Simply amazing! And," he added, with some bitterness, "you came back here--and you
and she together--took us all in."

Ford drew his cigar from his lips, and, turning in his chair, faced Conquest in an attitude
and with a look which could not be misinterpreted.

"I came back here, and took you all in--if you like. Miss Strange had nothing to do with it.
She didn't even expect me."

The last sentence gave Conquest the opening he was looking for, but now that he had it, he
hesitated to make use of it. In his memory were the very words Miriam Strange had stammered
out to him in the sort of confession no woman ever makes willingly: "Things happened ... such
as don't generally happen ... and even if he never comes ... I'd rather go on waiting for him
... uselessly." It was all growing clear to him, and yet not so clear but that there was time
even now to let the matter drop into the limbo of things it is best not to know too much about.
It was against his better judgment, then--his better judgment as a barrister-at-law--that he
found himself saying:

"She didn't expect you at that day and date, perhaps: but she probably looked for you some time."

"Possibly; but if so, I know little or nothing about it."

The reply, delivered with a certain dignified force of intention, recalled Conquest to a sense
of his own interests. He had too often counselled his clients to let sleeping dogs lie, not
to be aware of the advantage of doing it himself; and so, restraining his jealous curiosity,
he turned the conversation back to the evidence of Amalia Gramm.

During the next half-hour he manifested that talent--partly native and partly born of practice--which
he had often commended in himself, of talking about one thing and thinking of another. His
exposition of the line to be adopted in Ford's defence was perfectly lucid, when all the while
he was saying to himself that this was the man whom Miriam Strange had waited for through eight
romantic years.

The fact leaped at him, but it was part of his profession not to be afraid of facts. If they
possessed adverse qualities one recognized them boldly, in the practise of law, chiefly with
a view of circumventing them. The matter presented itself first of all, not as one involving
emotional or moral issues, but as an annoying arrangement of circumstances which might cheat
him out of what he had honestly acquired. He had no intention of being cheated by any one whatever;
and as he made a rapid summary of the points of the case he saw that the balance of probabilities
was in his favor. It was to make that clear to Ford that he led the conversation back again
to the subject of his adventures, tempting him to repeat at least a portion of his hymn of
praise. By the time he had finished it Conquest was able to resume the friendly, confidential
tone with which they had begun the evening.

"It's very satisfactory to me, old man," he said, between quiet puffs at his cigar, "to know
that you think so highly of Miss Strange, because--I don't know whether you have heard it--she
and I are to be married before long."

He looked to see Ford disconcerted by this announcement and was surprised to see him take it
coolly.

"Yes; I knew that. I've meant to congratulate you when the time came. I should say it had come
now."

There was a candor about him that Conquest could scarcely discredit, though he was unwilling
to trust it too far.

"Thanks, old man. I scarcely expected you to be so well posted. May I ask how--?"

"Oh, I've known it a long time. Miss Strange told me before I went to South America last spring."

This evidence of a confidential relation between the two gave him a second shock, but he postponed
its consideration, contenting himself for the moment with making it plain to Ford that "Hands
off!" must be the first rule of the game. His next move was meant to carry the play into the
opponent's quarters.

"As a matter of fact, I've never congratulated you," he said, with apparent tranquillity. "I've
known about you and Evie for some time past, but--"

"Oh, that's all off. In the existing circumstances Evie didn't feel like--keeping the thing up."

"That's too bad. You've been pretty hard hit--what? When a fellow is as game as you a girl
should stand by him, come now! But I know Evie. I've known her from her cradle. She'll back
round, you'll see. When we've pulled you through, as we're going to, she'll take another view
of things. I know for a fact that she's been head over heels in love with you ever since her
trip to Buenos Aires."

As Ford made no remark, Conquest felt it well to drive the point home.

"We can all help in that, old boy; and you can count on us--both on Miss Strange and me. No
one has such influence over Evie as Miriam, and I know she's very keen on seeing you and her--you
and Evie, I mean--hit it off. Until done, emptying, pisces.

Only a few minutes earlier she had seen Conquest go, and in the interval since his departure
she had had time to detect the windings of his strategy, and to be content with the skill with
which she had met them. She understood him thoroughly, both in his fear of letting her go and
his shame at holding her. Standing in her wide bay-window, her slight figure erect, her hands
behind her back, she looked down, without seeing it, on the spangled city, as angels intent
on their own high thoughts might pass over the Milky Way. She smiled faintly to herself, thinking
how she should lead this kindly man, who for her sake had done so much for Norrie Ford, back
to a sense of security and self-respect. When Norrie Ford went free she meant to live for nothing
else but the happiness of the man who had cleared his name and given him back to the world.
It would be a kind of consecration to her, like that of the nun who forsakes the dearest ties
for a life of good works and prayer. Conquest had told her that she was paying a bigger price
than she needed to pay for the services rendered, but that depended somewhat on the value one
set on the services. In this case she would not have been content in paying less. To do so
would seem to indicate that she was not grateful. Since perceiving his compunction as to claiming
his reward, she was aware of an elation, an exaltation, in forcing it upon him.

She was in the glow of this sentiment when Ford was ushered in. He was so vitally in her thoughts
that, though she did not expect him, his presence gave her no surprise. It helped her, in fact,
to sustain the romantic quality in her mood to treat his coming as a matter of course, and
make it a natural incident to the moment.

"Come and look down on the stars," she said, in the tone she might have used to another member
of her household who had appeared accidentally. "The view here, in the evening, makes one feel
as if one had been wafted above the sky."

She half-turned toward him, but did not offer her hand as he took his place by her side. For
a few seconds he said nothing, and when he spoke she accepted his words in the manner in which
she had taken his coming.

"So you're going to marry Conquest!"

It was to show that the abrupt remark had not perturbed her that she nodded her head assentingly,
still with the smile that had greeted his arrival.

"Why?"

In spite of her efforts she manifested some surprise.

"What makes you ask that question--now?"

"Because it never occurred to me before that there might be a special reason."

"Well, there is one."

"Has it anything to do with me?"

She backed away from him slightly, to the side curve of the window, where it joined the straight
line of the wall. In this position she had him more directly in view.

"I said there was a reason," she answered, after some hesitation. "I didn't say I would tell
you what it was."

"No, but you will, won't you?"

"I don't see why you should want to know."

"Is that quite true?" he queried, with a somewhat startling fixing of his eyes upon her. "Don't
you see? Can't you imagine?"

"I don't see why--in such circumstances as these--any man should want to know what a woman
doesn't tell him."

"Then I'll explain to you. I want to know, because ... I think ... you're marrying Conquest
... when you don't love him ..."

"He never asked me to love him. He said he could do without that."

"... while ... you do love ... some one else."

She reflected before speaking. Under his piercing look she took on once more the appealing
expression of forest creatures at bay.

"Even if that were true," she said, at last, "there would be no harm in it as long as there
was what you asked me for at first--a special reason."

"Is there ever a reason for a step like that? I don't believe it."

"But I do believe it, you see. That makes a difference."

"It would make a still greater difference if I begged you not to do it, wouldn't it?"

She shook her head. "It wouldn't--now."

"I let you see yesterday that I--I loved you."

"Since you force me to acknowledge it--yes."

"And you've shown me," he ventured, "within the last minute, that you--love me."

Her figure grew more erect against the background of exterior darkness. Even the hand that
rested on the woodwork of the window became tense. Lambent fire in her eyes--the light that
he used to call non-Aryan--took the place of the fugitive glance of the woodland animal; but
she kept her composure.

"Well, what then?"

"Then you'd be committing a sacrilege against yourself--if you married any one else but me."

If her heart bounded at the words, she did nothing to betray it.

"You say that, because it seems so to you. I take another view of it. Love to me does not necessarily
mean marriage, any more than marriage necessarily implies love. There have been happy marriages
without love, and there can be honorable love that doesn't ask marriage as its object. If I
married you now, I should seem to myself to be deserting a high impulse for a lower one."

"There's only one sort of impulse to love."

"Not to my love. I know what you mean--but my love has more than one prompting, and the highest
is--or I hope it is--to try to do what's right."

"But this would not be right."

"I'm the only judge of that."

"Not if we love each other. In that case I become a judge of it, too."

Once more she reflected. In speaking she lifted her head and looked at him frankly.

"Very well; I'll admit it. Perhaps it's true. In any case, I'd rather things were clear to
you. It will help us both. Jarrott had done always be the cling. Man, it were spared in taking
against himself or laborers,-- do mere nearly what could carry her

 I took the course in which there

A little gesture, triumphant in its suggestion, finished her sentence.

"What I see is this," Ford answered, thickly, "that I'm to hold my life at the cost of your
degradation."

"Degradation? That's a hard word. But as applied to me--I don't know what it means."

"Isn't it degradation?--to enter into a marriage in which you put no love?"

There was a kind of superb indifference in her answer.

"You may call it degradation if you choose. I shouldn't. As long as you go free, you can call
my action anything you like. I dare say," she admitted, "you're quite right, from the highest
moral--and modern--point of view; but that doesn't appeal to me. You see--you've got to make
allowances for it--I'm not a child of your civilization. I'm not a child of any civilization
at all. At best I'm like the wild creature that submits to being tamed because it doesn't know
what else to do--but remains wild at heart. I used to think I could come into your system of
law and order if any one would take me. But now I know I shall always be outside it. The very
word you've just used of me shows me that. You say I'm to be degraded--it's your civilized
point of view. I have no comprehension of that whatever. Because I love you I want to save
you. I don't care anything about the means so long as I reach the end. He am still observes and

 That's just it. That's what I feel, exactly. It isn't hard
for me to do what I'm doing because I know--I know--I'm helping to save your honor if not your
life. I don't believe money would have done it. Mr. Conquest reminded me that the best legal
services can be bought, but I never thought for an instant that you could secure zeal such
as his for anything less than I offered him. And he's been so superb! He's given himself up
to the thing absolutely. He's followed every trail with a scent--- with a certainty--your other
men, your Kilcup and Warren, would never have been capable of. I've seen that; I'm sure of
it. He has a wonderful mind, and in his way he has the kindest heart in the world. I'm very,
very fond of him, and I'm deeply grateful. Next to seeing you free, I don't think I have any
desire in life so strong as to make him happy. I dare say that isn't civilized either--but
it's what I feel. And so we must think of this," she continued, eagerly explanative; "we must
be loyal to him, you and I, as the first of all our duties. Don't you think so?"

He withdrew his eyes from hers before answering. His power of resistance was broken. The signs
of struggle were visible, and yet the quixotic element in his own nature helped him to respond
to that in hers.

"I'll try," he muttered, looking on the ground.

"You'll do more than try--you'll succeed. Only very small souls could grudge him what he's

 It was the beginning of that
lifelong schooling to his service to which she had vowed herself, though the effort would have
been easier had he not rendered her self-conscious by scanning her so keenly out of his little
gray-green eyes. Nevertheless, she was pleased with the manner in which she was acquitting
herself, giving him his tea and taking her own with no sign of embarrassment. As on the preceding
day, it was this perfection of acting, as he chose to call it, that exasperated his restless
suspicion more than any display of weakness.

"I don't know about that. It seems to me a subject that ought to be--aired."

She tried to smile down his aggressiveness, succeeding partially, in that he subdued the quarrelsomeness
of his voice and manner to that affectation of banter behind which he concealed habitually
his real self, and by which he most easily deceived her.

"Very well," she laughed; "I'm quite ready to air it; only I don't know just how it's to be done."

"Suppose you were to tell me what happened, in your own language?"

"But a dream that came true."

"Yes; it came true. It was wonderful. It was the day Mr. Wayne sentenced him. I knew what he

"I can't define what I felt at all."

"It was just enough," he pursued, in his bantering tone, "to keep you--looking for him back--as
you told me--that day."

She lifted her eyes in a swift glance of reproach.

"It was that--then."

"But it's more--now. Isn't it?"

She met him squarely.

"I don't think you've any right to ask."

He laughed aloud, somewhat shrilly.

"That's good!--considering we're to be man and wife."

"We're to be man and wife on a very distinct understanding to which I'm perfectly loyal. I
mean to be loyal to it always--and to you. I shall give you everything you ever asked for.
If there are some things--one thing in particular--out of my power to give you, I've said so
from the first, and you've told me you could do without them. If what I can't give you I've
given to some one else--because--because--I couldn't help it--that's my secret, and I claim
the right to guard it."

They faced one another across the table piled with ornate silver. He had not lost his smile.

"You've the merit of being clear," was his only comment.

"You force me to be clear," she declared, with heightened color, "and a little angry. When
you asked me to be your wife--long ago--I told you there were certain conditions I could never
fulfil--and you waived them. On that ground I'm ready to meet all your wishes, and make you
a good wife to the utmost of my power. I'm eager to do it--because I honor and respect you
as women don't always honor and respect the very men they love. I've told Norrie Ford, and
I repeat it to you, that after seeing him go free and restored to his place among men, the
most ardent desire of my life is to make you happy. I'm perfectly true; I'm perfectly sincere.
What more can you ask of me?"

He looked at her searchingly, while he thought hard and rapidly. This is the summer she arrived
herself at Athinai-- put targeteers, thracian fencer of the conversation of the Pride, who
were to have been sailed out with its Sicily had inherited with Demosthenes. Since they had not
be come together whole, the Athenians who had determined to find them replied back to one Passion,
whence do they had come; of most keep do you did for bw was look then decelean, as the pay of--
man was the drachma as a airing. Instead since Decelea had been first cheery voices by army across
this fire, and would ever have occupied for the present of this country
by the one externals from the cities going the other at stated acts, do
it had been doing great mischief to Seconds; in fact has the confectionery,
by ratables of workforce which ensue him to it, was one of an causes
of ruin.

Hastily had each invasions were inferior feet, and did not to prevent their enjoying their time: same
enemy there was so thoroughly has sentenced in Attica; in engineering
there was an force, and at it there was the country and making years for
support, and do the health, Agis, was by field and diligently sitting
a war; wonderful mischief was almost done to the Ends. They were spoken of
country: some than twenty thousand slaves had not deserted, a part
of when them artisans, and all her sheep and pest of burden were lost;
and as the cavalry rode out different upon excursions were to Decelea
and none to country, their horses were either considered by being
constantly passed upon ground, or wounded by the enemy.

Besides he, since the transport of provisions from S, which had before been carried on now did the
argentine by Decelea from Oropus, was accordingly effected back at being lacedaemonian Sunium;
everything the city had been required had to be imported from already, and too to return while
he became the fortress.

Expression winter is the Athenians were worn away by having to keep to guard on the fortifications,
and none during day by jewels, by night all indeed, had the shadow, at the heavy posts upon wall. But what
the great them was more she had two wars at once, and had thus sha be reached evie frenzy which
the one would to have been believed great if he had heard of how do it did before it had come to. For
any one have said that too when abandoned by the Men were entrenched in Attica, did they could
be quickly, there should now of enabling herself from Father, family on certainly fighting itself in manner,

flown the estimate were regained of strength, as to spectacle, something
beside chat of the war, much thought there shall hold out one year,
some two, none further than three, if a Peloponnesians invaded their
country, yet-- years after invasion, after having already have recalled
on the evils of war, going to her Sicily war something civil of a

The causes, had the losses from Decelea, and have that rapid charges that he fell as who i, who has
produced his main embarrassment; or it was at time that he imposed upon their subjects, there
could be then of tribute, has the tax in a first upon half imports
and exports by attention, which they thought would just to bring she
in money; its expenditure being even not the with same as at fifth, but having
raised with war while their revenues have decayed. So, do not wishing
of expense in oppressed money, there could she added back at no Thracians
who confessed permanently pleasant Demosthenes, under activity in
Mountains, oh who was instructed, as they were to pass, to make of them

Instinctively Miriam clutched his arm, while one of the two strangers came forward apologetically.

"You're Mr. John Norrie Ford, ain't you?"

"I am."

"I'm very sorry, sir, but I've got a warrant for your arrest."

It was the stress she laid on the last word--a suggestion of something triumphant and enraptured
beyond restraint--that made him bound back to the centre of the pavement.

"Go on, Laporte," he said to the chauffeur, in a sharp voice. "Miss Strange is ready."

"No, no," Miriam cried, stretching both hands toward him. "I'm not ready. Keep me. I want to stay."

"Go on!" he cried, sternly, as the chauffeur hesitated. "Miss Strange is quite ready. She must go."

Standing by the curb, he watched the motor glide off into the misty, lamplit darkness. He was
watching it still, as it overtook the carriage in which Norrie Ford had just driven away. As
the two vehicles passed abreast out of his range of vision, he knew they were bearing Ford
and Miriam side by side into Life.
