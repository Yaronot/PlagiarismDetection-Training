When during a long epoch a continent, slowly sinking, gives place to a far-spreading ocean
some miles in depth, at the bottom of which no deposits from rivers or abraded shores can be
thrown down; and when, after some enormous period, this ocean-bottom is gradually elevated
and becomes the site for new strata; it is clear that the fossils contained in these new strata
are likely to have but little in common with the fossils of the strata below them. Take, in
illustration, the case of the North Atlantic. We have already named the fact that between this
country and the United States, the ocean-bottom is being covered with a deposit of chalk--a
deposit which has been forming, probably, ever since there occurred that great depression of
the Earth's crust from which the Atlantic resulted in remote geologic times. This chalk consists
of the minute shells of Foraminifera, sprinkled with remains of small Entomostraca, and probably
a few Pteropod-shells; though the sounding lines have not yet brought up any of these last.
Thus, in so far as all high forms of life are concerned, this new chalk-formation must be a
blank. At rare intervals, perhaps, a polar bear, drifted on an iceberg, may have its bones
scattered over the bed; or a dead, decaying whale may similarly leave traces. But such remains
must be so rare, that this new chalk-formation, if accessible, might be examined for a century
before any of them were disclosed. If now, some millions of years hence, the Atlantic-bed should
be raised, and estuary deposits or shore deposits laid upon it, these would contain remains
of a Flora and a Fauna so distinct from everything below them, as to appear like a new creation.

Thus, along with continuity of life on the Earth's surface, there not only may be, but there
must be, great gaps in the series of fossils; and hence these gaps are no evidence against
the doctrine of Evolution.

       *       *       *       *       *

One other current assumption remains to be criticized; and it is the one on which, more than
on any other, depends the view taken respecting the question of development.

From the beginning of the controversy, the arguments for and against have turned upon the evidence
of progression in organic forms, found in the ascending series of our sedimentary formations.
On the one hand, those who contend that higher organisms have been evolved out of lower, joined
with those who contend that successively higher organisms have been created at successively
later periods, appeal for proof to the facts of Paleontology; which, they say, countenance
their views. On the other hand, the Uniformitarians, who not only reject the hypothesis of
development, but deny that the modern forms of life are higher than the ancient ones, reply
that the paleontological evidence is at present very incomplete; that though we have not yet
found remains of highly-organized creatures in strata of the greatest antiquity, we must not
assume that no such creatures existed when those strata were deposited; and that, probably,
search will eventually disclose them.

It must be admitted that thus far, the evidence has gone in favour of the latter party. Geological
discovery has year after year shown the small value of negative facts. The conviction that
there are no traces of higher organisms in earlier strata, has resulted not from the absence
of such traces, but from incomplete examination. At p. 460 of his Manual of Elementary Geology,
Sir Charles Lyell gives a list in illustration of this. It appears that in 1709, fishes were
not known lower than the Permian system. In 1793 they were found in the subjacent Carboniferous
system; in 1828 in the Devonian; in 1840 in the Upper Silurian. Of reptiles, we read that in
1710 the lowest known were in the Permian; in 1844 they were detected in the Carboniferous;
and in 1852 in the Upper Devonian. While of the Mammalia the list shows that in 1798 none had
been discovered below the Middle Eocene: but that in 1818 they were discovered in the Lower
Oolite; and in 1847 in the Upper Trias.

The fact is, however, that both parties set out with an inadmissible postulate. Of the Uniformitarians,
not only such writers as Hugh Miller, but also such as Sir Charles Lyell,[27] reason as though
we had found the earliest, or something like the earliest, strata. Their antagonists, whether
defenders of the Development Hypothesis or simply Progressionists, almost uniformly do the
like. Sir R. Murchison, who is a Progressionist, calls the lowest fossiliferous strata, "Protozoic."
Prof. Ansted uses the same term. Whether avowedly or not, all the disputants stand on this
assumption as their common ground.

Yet is this assumption indefensible, as some who make it very well know. Facts may be cited
against it which show that it is a more than questionable one--that it is a highly improbable
one; while the evidence assigned in its favour will not bear criticism.

Because in Bohemia, Great Britain, and portions of North America, the lowest unmetamorphosed
strata yet discovered, contain but slight traces of life, Sir R. Murchison conceives that they
were formed while yet few, if any, plants or animals had been created; and, therefore, classes
them as "Azoic." His own pages, however, show the illegitimacy of the conclusion that there
existed at that period no considerable amount of life. Such traces of life as have been found
in the Longmynd rocks, for many years considered unfossiliferous, have been found in some of
the lowest beds; and the twenty thousand feet of superposed beds, still yield no organic remains.
If now these superposed strata throughout a depth of four miles, are without fossils, though
the strata over which they lie prove that life had commenced; what becomes of Sir R. Murchison's
inference? At page 189 of Siluria, a still more conclusive fact will be found. The "Glengariff
grits," and other accompanying strata there described as 13,500 feet thick, contain no signs
of contemporaneous life. Yet Sir R. Murchison refers them to the Devonian period--a period
which had a large and varied marine Fauna. How then, from the absence of fossils in the Longmynd
beds and their equivalents, can we conclude that the Earth was "azoic" when they were formed?

"But," it may be asked, "if living creatures then existed, why do we not find fossiliferous
strata of that age, or an earlier age?" One reply is, that the non-existence of such strata
is but a negative fact--we have not found them. And considering how little we know even of
the two-fifths of the Earth's surface now above the sea, and how absolutely ignorant we are
of the three-fifths below the sea, it is rash to say that no such strata exist. But the chief
reply is, that these records of the Earth's earlier history have been in great part destroyed,
by agencies which are ever tending to destroy such records.

It is an established geological doctrine, that sedimentary strata are liable to be changed,
more or less profoundly, by igneous action. The rocks originally classed as "transition," because
they were intermediate in character between the igneous rocks found below them, and the sedimentary
strata found above them, are now known to be nothing else than sedimentary strata altered in
texture and appearance by the intense heat of adjacent molten matter; and hence are renamed
"metamorphic rocks." Modern researches have shown, too, that these metamorphic rocks are not,
as was once supposed, all of the same age. Besides primary and secondary strata which have
been transformed by igneous action, there are similarly-changed deposits of tertiary origin--deposits
changed, even as far as a quarter of a mile from the point of contact with neighbouring granite.
By this process fossils are of course destroyed. "In some cases," says Sir Charles Lyell, "dark
limestones, replete with shells and corals, have been turned into white statuary marble, and
hard clays, containing vegetable or other remains, into slates called mica-schist or hornblende-schist;
every vestige of the organic bodies having been obliterated." Again, it is fast becoming an
acknowledged truth that igneous rock, of whatever kind, is the product of sedimentary strata
which have been completely melted. Granite and gneiss, which are of like chemical composition,
have been shown, in various cases, to pass one into the other; as at Valorsine, near Mont Blanc,
where the two, in contact, are observed to "both undergo a modification of mineral character.
The granite still remaining unstratified, becomes charged with green particles; and the talcose
gneiss assumes a granitiform structure without losing its stratification." In the Aberdeen-granite,
lumps of unmelted gneiss are abundant; and we can ourselves bear witness that the granite on
the banks of Loch Sunart yields proofs that, when molten, it contained incompletely-fused clots
of sedimentary strata. Nor is this all. Fifty years ago, it was thought that all granitic rocks
were primitive, or existed before any sedimentary strata; but it is now "no easy task to point
out a single mass of granite demonstrably more ancient than all the known fossiliferous deposits."
In brief, accumulated evidence shows, that by contact with, or proximity to, the molten matter
of the Earth's nucleus, all beds of sediment are liable to be actually melted, or partially
fused, or so heated as to agglutinate their particles; and that according to the temperature
they have been raised to, and the circumstances under which they cool, they assume the forms
of granite, porphyry, trap, gneiss, or rock otherwise altered. Further, it is manifest that
though strata of various ages have been thus changed, yet the most ancient strata have been
so changed to the greatest extent; both because they have been nearer to the centre of igneous
agency; and because they have been for longer periods liable to be affected by it. Whence it
follows, that sedimentary strata passing a certain antiquity, are unlikely to be found in an
unmetamorphosed state; and that strata much earlier than these are certain to have been melted
up. Thus if, throughout a past of indefinite duration, there had been at work those aqueous
and igneous agencies which we see still at work, the state of the Earth's crust might be just
what we find it. We have no evidence which puts a limit to the period throughout which this
formation and destruction of strata has been going on. For aught the facts prove, it may have
been going on for ten times the period measured by our whole series of sedimentary deposits.

Besides having, in the present appearances of the Earth's crust, no data for fixing a commencement
to these processes--besides finding that the evidence permits us to assume such commencement
to have been inconceivably remote, as compared even with the vast eras of geology; we are not
without positive grounds for inferring the inconceivable remoteness of such commencement. Modern
geology has established truths which are irreconcilable with the belief that the formation
and destruction of strata began when the Cambrian rocks were formed; or at anything like so
recent a time. One fact from Siluria will suffice. Sir R. Murchison estimates the vertical
thickness of Silurian strata in Wales, at from 26,000 to 27,000 feet, or about five miles;
and if to this we add the vertical depth of the Cambrian strata, on which the Silurians lie
conformably, there results, on the lowest computation, a total depth of some seven miles. Now
it is held by geologists, that this vast series of formations must have been deposited in an
area of gradual subsidence. These beds could not have been thus laid one on another in regular
order, unless the Earth's crust had been at that place sinking, either continuously or by small
steps. Such an immense subsidence, however, must have been impossible without a crust of great
thickness. The Earth's molten nucleus tends ever, with enormous force, to assume the form of
a regular oblate spheroid. Any depression of its crust below the surface of equilibrium, and
any elevation of its crust above that surface, have to withstand immense resistances. It follows
inevitably that, with a thin crust, nothing but small elevations and subsidences would have
been possible; and that, conversely, a subsidence of seven miles implies a crust of great strength,
or, in other words, of great thickness. Indeed, if we compare this inferred subsidence in the
Silurian period, with such elevations and depressions as our existing continents and oceans
display, we see no evidence that the Earth's crust was appreciably thinner then than now. What
are the implications? If, as geologists generally admit, the Earth's crust has resulted from
that slow cooling which is even still going on--if we see no sign that at the time when the
earliest Cambrian strata were formed, this crust was appreciably thinner than now; we are forced
to conclude that the era during which it acquired that great thickness possessed in the Cambrian
period, was enormous as compared with the interval between the Cambrian period and our own.
But during the incalculable series of epochs thus implied, there existed an ocean, tides, winds,
waves, rain, rivers. The agencies by which the denudation of continents and filling up of seas
have all along been carried on, were as active then as now. Endless successions of strata must
have been formed. And when we ask--Where are they? Nature's obvious reply is--They have been
destroyed by that igneous action to which so great a part of our oldest-known strata owe their
fusion or metamorphosis.

Only the last chapter of the Earth's history has come down to us. The many previous chapters,
stretching back to a time immeasurably remote, have been burnt; and with them all the records
of life we may presume they contained. The greater part of the evidence which might have served
to settle the Development-controversy, is for ever lost; and on neither side can the arguments
derived from Geology be conclusive.

"But how happen there to be such evidences of progression as exist?" it may be asked. "How
happens it that, in ascending from the most ancient strata to the most recent strata, we do
find a succession of organic forms, which, however irregularly, carries us from lower to higher?"
This question seems difficult to answer. Nevertheless, there is reason for thinking that nothing
can be safely inferred from the apparent progression here cited. And the illustration which
shows as much, will, we believe, also show how little trust is to be placed in certain geological
generalizations that appear to be well established. With this somewhat elaborate illustration,
to which we now pass, our criticisms may fitly conclude.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let us suppose that in a region now covered by wide ocean, there begins one of those great
and gradual upheavals by which new continents are formed. To be precise, let us say that in
the South Pacific, midway between New Zealand and Patagonia, the sea-bottom has been little
by little thrust up toward the surface, and is about to emerge. What will be the successive
phenomena, geological and biological, which are likely to occur before this emerging sea-bottom
has become another Europe or Asia? In the first place, such portions of the incipient land
as are raised to the level of the waves, will be rapidly denuded by them: their soft substance
will be torn up by the breakers, carried away by the local currents, and deposited in neighbouring
deeper water. Successive small upheavals will bring new and larger areas within reach of the
waves; fresh portions will each time be removed from the surfaces previously denuded; and further,
some of the newly-formed strata, being elevated nearly to the level of the water, will be washed
away and re-deposited. In course of time the harder formations of the upraised sea-bottom will
be uncovered. These, being less easily destroyed, will remain permanently above the surface;
and at their margins will arise the usual breaking down of rocks into beach-sand and pebbles.
While in the slow course of this elevation, going on at the rate of perhaps two or three feet
in a century, most of the sedimentary deposits produced will be again and again destroyed and
reformed; there will, in those adjacent areas of subsidence which accompany areas of elevation,
be more or less continuous successions of sedimentary deposits lying on the pre-existing ocean
bed. And now, what will be the character of these strata, old and new? They will contain scarcely
any traces of life. The deposits that had previously been slowly formed at the bottom of this
wide ocean, would be sprinkled with fossils of but few species. The oceanic Fauna is not a
rich one; its hydrozoa do not admit of preservation; and the hard parts of its few kinds of
molluscs and crustaceans and insects are mostly fragile. Hence, when the ocean-bed was here
and there raised to the surface--when its strata of sediment with their contained organic fragments
were torn up and long washed about by the breakers before being re-deposited--when the re-deposits
were again and again subject to this violent abrading action by subsequent small elevations,
as they would mostly be; what few fragile organic remains they contained, would be in nearly
all cases destroyed. Thus such of the first-formed strata as survived the repeated changes
of level, would be practically "azoic;" like the Cambrian of our geologists. When by the washing
away of the soft deposits, the hard sub-strata had been exposed in the shape of rocky islets,
and a footing had thus been furnished, the pioneers of a new life might be expected to make
their appearance. What would they be? Not any of the surrounding oceanic species, for these
are not fitted for a littoral life; but species flourishing on some of the far-distant shores
of the Pacific. Of such, the first to establish themselves would be sea-weeds and zoophytes;
because the most readily conveyed on floating wood, &c., and because when conveyed they would
find fit food. It is true that Cirrhipeds and Lamellibranchs, subsisting on the minute creatures
which everywhere people the sea, would also find fit food. But the chances of early colonization
are in favour of species which, multiplying by agamogenesis, can people a whole shore from
a single germ; and against species which, multiplying only by gamogenesis, must be introduced
in considerable numbers that some may propagate. Thus we infer that the earliest traces of
life left in the sedimentary deposits near these new shores, will be traces of life as humble
as that indicated in the most ancient rocks of Great Britain and Ireland. Imagine now that
the processes above indicated, continue--that the emerging lands become wider in extent, and
fringed by higher and more varied shores; and that there still go on those ocean-currents which,
at long intervals, convey from far distant shores immigrant forms of life. What will result?
Lapse of time will of course favour the introduction of such new forms: admitting, as it must,
of those combinations of fit conditions, which can occur only after long intervals. Moreover,
the increasing area of the islands, individually and as a group, implies increasing length
of coast, and therefore a longer line of contact with the streams and waves which bring drifting
masses bearing germs of fresh life. And once more, the comparatively-varied shores, presenting
physical conditions which change from mile to mile, will furnish suitable habitats for more
numerous species. So that as the elevation proceeds, three causes conspire to introduce additional
marine plants and animals. To what classes will the increasing Fauna be for a long period confined?
Of course, to classes of which individuals, or their germs, are most liable to be carried far
away from their native shores by floating sea-weed or drift-wood; to classes which are also
least likely to perish in transit, or from change of climate; and to those which can best subsist
around coasts comparatively bare of life. Evidently then, corals, annelids, inferior molluscs,
and crustaceans of low grade, will chiefly constitute the early Fauna. The large predatory
members of these classes, will be later in establishing themselves; both because the new shores
must first become well peopled by the creatures they prey on, and because, being more complex,
they, or their ova, must be less likely to survive the journey, and the change of conditions.
We may infer, then, that the strata deposited next after the almost "azoic" strata, would contain
the remains of invertebrata, allied to those found near the shores of Australia and South America.
Of such invertebrate remains, the lower beds would furnish comparatively few genera, and those
of relatively low types; while in the upper beds the number of genera would be greater, and
the types higher: just as among the fossils of our Silurian system. As this great geologic
change slowly advanced through its long history of earthquakes, volcanic disturbances, minor
upheavals and subsidences--as the extent of the archipelago became greater and its smaller
islands coalesced into larger ones, while its coast-line grew still longer and more varied,
and the neighbouring sea more thickly inhabited by inferior forms of life; the lowest division
of the vertebrata would begin to be represented. In order of time, fish would naturally come
later than the lower invertebrata; both as being less likely to have their ova transported
across the waste of waters, and as requiring for their subsistence a pre-existing Fauna of
some development. They might be expected to make their appearance along with the predaceous
crustaceans; as they do in the uppermost Silurian rocks. And here, too, let us remark, that
as, during this long epoch we have been describing, the sea would have made great inroads on
some of the newly-raised lands which had remained stationary; and would probably in some places
have reached masses of igneous or metamorphic rocks; there might, in course of time, arise
by the decomposition and denudation of such rocks, local deposits coloured with oxide of iron,
like our Old Red Sandstone. And in these deposits might be buried the remains of the fish then
peopling the neighbouring sea.

Meanwhile, how would the surfaces of the upheaved masses be occupied? At first their deserts
of naked rocks would bear only the humblest forms of vegetal life, such as we find in grey
and orange patches on our own rugged mountain sides; for these alone could flourish on such
surfaces, and their spores would be the most readily transported. When, by the decay of such
protophytes, and that decomposition of rock effected by them, there had resulted a fit habitat
for mosses; these, of which the germs might be conveyed in drifted trees, would begin to spread.
A soil having been eventually thus produced, it would become possible for plants of higher
organization to find roothold; and as the archipelago and its constituent islands grew larger,
and had more multiplied relations with winds and waters, such higher plants might be expected
ultimately to have their seeds transferred from the nearest lands. After something like a Flora
had thus colonized the surface, it would become possible for insects to exist; and of air-breathing
creatures, insects would manifestly be among the first to find their way from elsewhere. As,
however, terrestrial organisms, both vegetal and animal, are less likely than marine organisms
to survive the accidents of transport from distant shores; it is inferable that long after
the sea surrounding these new lands had acquired a varied Flora and Fauna, the lands themselves
would still be comparatively bare; and thus that the early strata, like our Silurians, would
afford no traces of terrestrial life. By the time that large areas had been raised above the
ocean, we may fairly suppose a luxuriant vegetation to have been acquired. Under what circumstances
are we likely to find this vegetation fossilized? Large surfaces of land imply large rivers
with their accompanying deltas; and are liable to have lakes and swamps. These, as we know
from extant cases, are favourable to rank vegetation; and afford the conditions needful for
preserving it in coal-beds. Observe, then, that while in the early history of such a continent
a carboniferous period could not occur, the occurrence of a carboniferous period would become
probable after long-continued upheavals had uncovered large areas. As in our own sedimentary
series, coal-beds would make their appearance only after there had been enormous accumulations
of earlier strata charged with marine fossils.

Let us ask next, in what order the higher forms of animal life would make their appearance.
We have seen how, in the succession of marine forms, there would be something like a progress
from the lower to the higher: bringing us in the end to predaceous molluscs, crustaceans, and
fish. What are likely to succeed fish? After marine creatures, those which would have the greatest
chance of surviving the voyage would be amphibious reptiles; both because they are more tenacious
of life than higher animals, and because they would be less completely out of their element.
Such reptiles as can live in both fresh and salt water, like alligators; and such as are drifted
out of the mouths of great rivers on floating trees, as Humboldt says the Orinoco alligators
are; might be early colonists. It is manifest, too, that reptiles of other kinds would be among
the first vertebrata to people the new continent. If we consider what will occur on one of
those natural rafts of trees, soil, and matted vegetable matter, sometimes swept out to sea
by such currents as the Mississippi, with a miscellaneous living cargo; we shall see that while
the active, hot-blooded, highly-organized creatures will soon die of starvation and exposure,
the inert, cold-blooded ones, which can go long without food, will live perhaps for weeks;
and so, out of the chances from time to time occurring during long periods, reptiles will be
the first to get safely landed on foreign shores: as indeed they are even now known sometimes
to be. The transport of mammalia being comparatively precarious, must, in the order of probability,
be longer postponed; and would, indeed, be unlikely to occur until by the enlargement of the
new continent, the distances of its shores from adjacent lands had been greatly diminished,
or the formation of intervening islands had increased the chances of survival. Assuming, however,
that the facilities for immigration had become adequate; which would be the first mammals to
arrive and live? Not large herbivores; for they would be soon drowned if by any accident carried
out to sea. Not the carnivora; for these would lack appropriate food, even if they outlived
the voyage. Small quadrupeds frequenting trees, and feeding on insects, would be those most
likely both to be drifted away from their native lands and to find fit food in a new one. Insectivorous
mammals, like in size to those found in the Trias and the Stonesfield slate, might naturally
be looked for as the pioneers of the higher vertebrata. And if we suppose the facilities of
communication to be again increased, either by a further shallowing of the intervening sea
and a consequent multiplication of islands, or by an actual junction of the new continent with
an old one, through continued upheavals; we should finally have an influx of the larger and
more perfect mammals.

Now rude as is this sketch of a process that would be extremely elaborate and involved, and
open as some of its propositions are to criticisms which there is no space here to meet; no
one will deny that it represents something like the biologic history of the supposed new continent.
Details apart, it is manifest that simple organisms, able to flourish under simple conditions
of life, would be the first successful immigrants; and that more complex organisms, needing
for their existence the fulfilment of more complex conditions, would afterwards establish themselves
in something like an ascending succession. At the one extreme we see every facility. The new
individuals can be conveyed in the shape of minute germs; immense numbers of these are perpetually
being carried in all directions to great distances by ocean-currents--either detached or attached
to floating bodies; they can find nutriment wherever they arrive; and the resulting organisms
can multiply asexually with great rapidity. At the other extreme, we see every difficulty.
The new individuals must be conveyed in their adult forms; their numbers are, in comparison,
utterly insignificant; they live on land, and are very unlikely to be carried out to sea; when
so carried, the chances are immense against their escape from drowning, starvation, or death
by cold; if they survive the transit, they must have a pre-existing Flora or Fauna to supply
their special food; they require, also, the fulfilment of various other physical conditions;
and unless at least two individuals of different sexes are safely landed, the race cannot be
established. Manifestly, then, the immigration of each successively higher order of organisms,
having, from one or other additional condition to be fulfilled, an enormously-increased probability
against it, would naturally be separated from the immigration of a lower order by some period
like a geologic epoch. And thus the successive sedimentary deposits formed while this new continent
was undergoing gradual elevation, would seem to furnish clear evidence of a general progress
in the forms of life. That lands thus raised up in the midst of a wide ocean, would first give
origin to unfossiliferous strata; next, to strata containing only the lowest marine forms;
next to strata containing only the higher marine forms, ascending finally to fish; and that
the strata above these would contain reptiles, then small mammals, then great mammals; seems
to us demonstrable. And if the succession of fossils presented by the strata of this supposed
new continent, would thus simulate the succession presented by our own sedimentary series;
must we not conclude that our own sedimentary series very possibly records nothing more than
the phenomena accompanying one of these great upheavals? The probability of this conclusion
being admitted, it must be admitted that the facts of Paleontology can never suffice either
to prove or disprove the Development Hypothesis; but that the most they can do is to show whether
the last few pages of the Earth's biologic history, are or are not in harmony with this hypothesis--whether
the existing Flora and Fauna can or can not be affiliated upon the Flora and Fauna of the most
recent geologic times.

and admirable candour he has, since this was written, yielded to the arguments of Mr. Darwin.]

BAIN ON THE EMOTIONS AND THE WILL.

    [First published in The Medico-Chirurgical Review for January,
    1860.]

After the controversy between the Neptunists and the Vulcanists had been long carried on without
definite results, there came a reaction against all speculative geology. Reasoning without
adequate data having led to nothing, inquirers went into the opposite extreme, and confining
themselves wholly to collecting data, relinquished reasoning. The Geological Society of London
was formed with the express object of accumulating evidence; for many years hypotheses were
forbidden at its meetings: and only of late have attempts to organize the mass of observations
into consistent theory been tolerated.

This reaction and subsequent re-reaction, well illustrate the recent history of English thought
in general. The time was when our countrymen speculated, certainly to as great an extent as
any other people, on all those high questions which present themselves to the human intellect;
and, indeed, a glance at the systems of philosophy that are or have been current on the Continent,
suffices to show how much other nations owe to the discoveries of our ancestors. For a generation
or two, however, these more abstract subjects have fallen into neglect; and, among those who
plume themselves on being "practical," even into contempt. Partly, perhaps, a natural accompaniment
of our rapid material growth, this intellectual phase has been in great measure due to the
exhaustion of argument, and the necessity for better data. Not so much with a conscious recognition
of the end to be subserved, as from an unconscious subordination to that rhythm traceable in
social changes as in other things, an era of theorizing without observing, has been followed
by an era of observing without theorizing. During this long-continued devotion to concrete
science, an immense quantity of raw material for abstract science has been accumulated; and
now there is obviously commencing a period in which this accumulated raw material will be organized
into consistent theory. On all sides--equally in the inorganic sciences, in the science of
life, and in the science of society--we may note the tendency to pass from the superficial
and empirical to the more profound and rational.

In Psychology this change is conspicuous. The facts brought to light by anatomists and physiologists
during the last fifty years, are at length being used towards the interpretation of this highest
class of biological phenomena; and already there is promise of a great advance. The work of
Mr. Alexander Bain, of which the second volume has been recently issued, may be regarded as
especially characteristic of the transition. It gives us, in orderly arrangement, the great
mass of evidence supplied by modern science towards the building-up of a coherent system of
mental philosophy. It is not in itself a system of mental philosophy, properly so called; but
a classified collection of materials for such a system, presented with that method and insight
which scientific discipline generates, and accompanied with occasional passages of an analytical
character. It is indeed that which it in the main professes to be--a natural history of the
mind. Were we to say that the researches of the naturalist who collects and dissects and describes
species, bear the same relation to the researches of the comparative anatomist tracing out
the laws of organization, which Mr. Bain's labours bear to the labours of the abstract psychologist,
we should be going somewhat too far; for Mr. Bain's work is not wholly descriptive. Still,
however, such an analogy conveys the best general conception of what he has done; and serves
most clearly to indicate its needfulness. For as, before there can be made anything like true
generalizations respecting the classification of organisms and the laws of organization, there
must be an extensive accumulation of the facts presented in numerous organic bodies; so, without
a tolerably-complete delineation of mental phenomena of all orders, there can scarcely arise
any adequate theory of mind. Until recently, mental science has been pursued much as physical
science was pursued by the ancients; not by drawing conclusions from observations and experiments,
but by drawing them from arbitrary a priori assumptions. This course, long since abandoned
in the one case with immense advantage, is gradually being abandoned in the other; and the
treatment of Psychology as a division of natural history, shows that the abandonment will soon
be complete.

Estimated as a means to higher results, Mr. Bain's work is of great value. Of its kind it is
the most scientific in conception, the most catholic in spirit, and the most complete in execution.
Besides delineating the various classes of mental phenomena as seen under that stronger light
thrown on them by modern science, it includes in the picture much which previous writers had
omitted--partly from prejudice, partly from ignorance. We refer more especially to the participation
of bodily organs in mental changes; and the addition to the primary mental changes, of those
many secondary ones which the actions of the bodily organs generate. Mr. Bain has, we believe,
been the first to appreciate the importance of this element in our states of consciousness;
and it is one of his merits that he shows how constant and large an element it is. Further,
the relations of voluntary and involuntary movements are elucidated in a way that was not possible
to writers unacquainted with the modern doctrine of reflex action. And beyond this, some of
the analytical passages that here and there occur, contain important ideas.

Valuable, however, as is Mr. Bain's work, we regard it as essentially transitional. It presents
in a digested form the results of a period of observation; adds to these results many well-delineated
facts collected by himself; arranges new and old materials with that more scientific method
which the discipline of our times has fostered; and so prepares the way for better generalizations.
But almost of necessity its classifications and conclusions are provisional. In the growth
of each science, not only is correct observation needful for the formation of true theory;
but true theory is needful as a preliminary to correct observation. Of course we do not intend
this assertion to be taken literally; but as a strong expression of the fact that the two must
advance hand in hand. The first crude theory or rough classification, based on very slight
knowledge of the phenomena, is requisite as a means of reducing the phenomena to some kind
of order; and as supplying a conception with which fresh phenomena may be compared, and their
agreement or disagreement noted. Incongruities being by and by made manifest by wider examination
of cases, there comes such modification of the theory as brings it into a nearer correspondence
with the evidence. This reacts to the further advance of observation. More extensive and complete
observation brings additional corrections of theory; and so on till the truth is reached. In
mental science, the systematic collection of facts having but recently commenced, it is not
to be expected that the results can be at once rightly formulated. All that may be looked for
are approximate generalizations which will presently serve for the better directing of inquiry.
Hence, even were it not now possible to say in what way it does so, we might be tolerably certain
that Mr. Bain's work bears the stamp of the inchoate state of Psychology.

We think, however, that it will not be difficult to find in what respects its organization
is provisional; and at the same time to show what must be the nature of a more complete organization.
We propose here to attempt this: illustrating our positions from his recently-issued second volume.

       *       *       *       *       *

Is it possible to make a true classification without the aid of analysis? or must there not
be an analytical basis to every true classification? Can the real relations of things be determined
by the obvious characteristics of the things? or does it not commonly happen that certain hidden
characteristics, on which the obvious ones depend, are the truly significant ones? This is
the preliminary question which a glance at Mr. Bain's scheme of the emotions suggests.

Though not avowedly, yet by implication, Mr. Bain assumes that a right conception of the nature,
the order, and the relations of the emotions, may be arrived at by contemplating their conspicuous
objective and subjective characters, as displayed in the adult. After pointing out that we
lack those means of classification which serve in the case of the sensations, he says--

     "In these circumstances we must turn our attention to the manner
     of diffusion of the different passions and emotions, in order to
     obtain a basis of classification analogous to the arrangement of
     the sensations. If what we have already advanced on that subject be
     at all well founded, this is the genuine turning point of the
     method to be chosen, for the same mode of diffusion will always be
     accompanied by the same mental experience, and each of the two
     aspects would identify, and would be evidence of, the other. There
     is, therefore, nothing so thoroughly characteristic of any state of
     feeling as the nature of the diffusive wave that embodies it, or
     the various organs specially roused into action by it, together
     with the manner of the action. The only drawback is our comparative
     ignorance, and our inability to discern the precise character of
     the diffusive currents in every case; a radical imperfection in the
     science of mind as constituted at present.

     "Our own consciousness, formerly reckoned the only medium of
     knowledge to the mental philosopher, must therefore be still
     referred to as a principal means of discriminating the varieties of
     human feeling. We have the power of noting agreement and difference
     among our conscious states, and on this we can raise a structure of
     classification. We recognise such generalities as pleasure, pain,
     love, anger, through the property of mental or intellectual
     discrimination that accompanies in our mind the fact of emotion. A
     certain degree of precision is attainable by this mode of mental
     comparison and analysis; the farther we can carry such precision
     the better; but that is no reason why it should stand alone to the
     neglect of the corporeal embodiments through which one mind reveals
     itself to others. The companionship of inward feeling with bodily
     manifestation is a fact of the human constitution, and deserves to
     be studied as such; and it would be difficult to find a place more
     appropriate than a treatise on the mind for setting forth the
     conjunctions and sequences traceable in this department of nature.
     I shall make no scruple in conjoining with the description of the
     mental phenomena the physical appearances, in so far as I am able
     to ascertain them.

     "There is still one other quarter to be referred to in settling a
     complete arrangement of the emotions, namely, the varieties of
     human conduct, and the machinery created in subservience to our
     common susceptibilities. For example, the vast superstructure of
     fine art has its foundations in human feeling, and in rendering an
     account of this we are led to recognise the interesting group of
     artistic or æsthetic emotions. The same outward reference to
     conduct and creations brings to light the so-called moral sense in
     man, whose foundations in the mental system have accordingly to be
     examined.

     "Combining together these various indications, or sources of
     discrimination,--outward objects, diffusive mode or expression,
     inward consciousness, resulting conduct and institutions,--I adopt
     the following arrangement of the families or natural orders of
     emotion."

Here, then, are confessedly adopted, as bases of classification, the most manifest characters
of the emotions; as discerned subjectively, and objectively. The mode of diffusion of an emotion
is one of its outside aspects; the institutions it generates form another of its outside aspects;
and though the peculiarities of the emotion as a state of consciousness, seem to express its
intrinsic and ultimate nature, yet such peculiarities as are perceptible by simple introspection,
must also be classed as superficial peculiarities. It is a familiar fact that various intellectual
states of consciousness turn out, when analyzed, to have natures widely unlike those which
at first appear; and we believe the like will prove true of emotional states of consciousness.
Just as our concept of space, which is apt to be thought a simple, undecomposable concept,
is yet resolvable into experiences quite different from that state of consciousness which we
call space; so, probably, the sentiment of affection or reverence is compounded of elements
that are severally distinct from the whole which they make up. And much as a classification
of our ideas which dealt with the idea of space as though it were ultimate, would be a classification
of ideas by their externals; so, a classification of our emotions, which, regarding them as
simple, describes their aspects in ordinary consciousness, is a classification of emotions
by their externals.

Thus, then, Mr. Bain's grouping is throughout determined by the most manifest attributes--those
objectively displayed in the natural language of the emotions, and in the social phenomena
that result from them, and those subjectively displayed in the aspects the emotions assume
in an analytical consciousness. And the question is--Can they be correctly grouped after this
method?

We think not; and had Mr. Bain carried farther an idea with which he has set out, he would
probably have seen that they cannot. As already said, he avowedly adopts "the natural-history-method:"
not only referring to it in his preface, but in his first chapter giving examples of botanical
and zoological classifications, as illustrating the mode in which he proposes to deal with
the emotions. This we conceive to be a philosophical conception; and we have only to regret
that Mr. Bain has overlooked some of its most important implications. For in what has essentially
consisted the progress of natural-history-classification? In the abandonment of grouping by
external, conspicuous characters; and in the making of certain internal, but all-essential
characters, the bases of groups. Whales are not now ranged along with fish, because in their
general forms and habits of life they resemble fish; but they are ranged with mammals, because
the type of their organization, as ascertained by dissection, corresponds with that of mammals.
No longer considered as sea-weeds in virtue of their forms and modes of growth, Polyzoa are
now shown, by examination of their economy, to belong to the animal kingdom. It is found, then,
that the discovery of real relationships involves analysis. It has turned out that the earlier
classifications, guided by general resemblances, though containing much truth, and though very
useful provisionally, were yet in many cases radically wrong; and that the true affinities
of organisms, and the true homologies of their parts, are to be made out only by examining
their hidden structures. Another fact of great significance in the history of classification
is also to be noted. Very frequently the kinship of an organism cannot be made out even by
exhaustive analysis, if that analysis is confined to the adult structure. In many cases it
is needful to examine the structure in its earlier stages; and even in its embryonic stage.
So difficult was it, for instance, to determine the true position of the Cirrhipedia among
animals, by examining mature individuals only, that Cuvier erroneously classed them with Mollusca,
even after dissecting them; and not until their early forms were discovered, were they clearly
proved to belong to the Crustacea. So important, indeed, is the study of development as a means
to classification, that the first zoologists now hold it to be the only absolute criterion.

Here, then, in the advance of natural-history-classification, are two fundamental facts, which
should be borne in mind when classifying the emotions. If, as Mr. Bain rightly assumes, the
emotions are to be grouped after the natural-history-method; then it should be the natural-history-method
in its complete form, and not in its rude form. Mr. Bain will doubtless agree in the belief,
that a correct account of the emotions in their natures and relations, must correspond with
a correct account of the nervous system--must form another side of the same ultimate facts.
Structure and function must necessarily harmonize. Structures which have with each other certain
ultimate connexions, must have functions which have answering connexions. Structures which
have arisen in certain ways, must have functions which have arisen in parallel ways. And hence
if analysis and development are needful for the right interpretation of structures, they must
be needful for the right interpretation of functions. Just as a scientific description of the
digestive organs must include not only their obvious forms and connexions, but their microscopic
characters, and also the ways in which they severally result by differentiation from the primitive
mucous membrane; so must a scientific account of the nervous system include its general arrangements,
its minute structure, and its mode of evolution; and so must a scientific account of nervous
actions include the answering three elements. Alike in classing separate organisms, and in
classing the parts of the same organism, the complete natural-history-method involves ultimate
analysis, aided by development; and Mr. Bain, in not basing his classification of the emotions
on characters reached through these aids, has fallen short of the conception with which he set out.

"But," it will perhaps be asked, "how are the emotions to be analyzed, and their modes of evolution
to be ascertained? Different animals, and different organs of the same animal, may readily
be compared in their internal structures and microscopic structures, as also in their developments;
but functions, and especially such functions as the emotions, do not admit of like comparisons."

It must be admitted that the application of these methods is here by no means so easy. Though
we can note differences and similarities between the internal formations of two animals; it
is difficult to contrast the mental states of two animals. Though the true morphological relations
of organs may be made out by observation of embryos; yet, where such organs are inactive before
birth, we cannot completely trace the history of their actions. Obviously, too, pursuance of
inquiries of the kind indicated, raises questions which science is not yet prepared to answer;
as, for instance--Whether all nervous functions, in common with all other functions, arise
by gradual differentiations, as their organs do? Whether the emotions are, therefore, to be
regarded as divergent modes of action that have become unlike by successive modifications?
Whether, as two organs which originally budded out of the same membrane have not only become
different as they developed, but have also severally become compound internally, though externally
simple; so two emotions, simple and near akin in their roots, may not only have grown unlike,
but may also have grown involved in their natures, though seeming homogeneous to consciousness?
And here, indeed, in the inability of existing science to answer these questions which underlie
a true psychological classification, we see how purely provisional any present classification
is likely to be.

Nevertheless, even now, classification may be aided by development and ultimate analysis to
a considerable extent; and the defect in Mr. Bain's work is, that he has not systematically
availed himself of them as far as possible. Thus we may, in the first place, study the evolution
of the emotions up through the various grades of the animal kingdom: observing which of them
are earliest and exist with the lowest organization and intelligence; in what order the others
accompany higher endowments; and how they are severally related to the conditions of life.
In the second place, we may note the emotional differences between the lower and the higher
human races--may regard as earlier and simpler those feelings which are common to both, and
as later and more compound those which are characteristic of the most civilized. In the third
place, we may observe the order in which the emotions unfold during the progress from infancy
to maturity. And lastly, comparing these three kinds of emotional development, displayed in
the ascending grades of the animal kingdom, in the advance of the civilized races, and in individual
history, we may see in what respects they harmonize, and what are the implied general truths.

Having gathered together and generalized these several classes of facts, analysis of the emotions
would be made easier. Setting out with the assumption that every new form of emotion making
its appearance in the individual or the race, is a modification of some pre-existing emotion,
or a compound of several pre-existing emotions, we should be greatly aided by knowing what
always are the pre-existing emotions. When, for example, we find that very few of the lower
animals show any love of accumulation, and that this feeling is absent in infancy--when we
see that an infant in arms exhibits anger, fear, wonder, while yet it manifests no desire of
permanent possession, and that a brute which has no acquisitiveness can nevertheless feel attachment,
jealousy, love of approbation; we may suspect that the feeling which property satisfies is
compounded out of simpler and deeper feelings. We may conclude that as, when a dog hides a
bone, there must exist in him a prospective gratification of hunger; so there must similarly
at first, in all cases where anything is secured or taken possession of, exist an ideal excitement
of the feeling which that thing will gratify. We may further conclude that when the intelligence
is such that a variety of objects come to be utilized for different purposes--when, as among
savages, divers wants are satisfied through the articles appropriated for weapons, shelter,
clothing, ornament; the act of appropriating comes to be one constantly involving agreeable
associations, and one which is therefore pleasurable, irrespective of the end subserved. And
when, as in civilized life, the property acquired is of a kind not conducing to one order of
gratification in particular, but is capable of administering to all gratifications, the pleasure
of acquiring property grows more distinct from each of the various pleasures subserved--is
more completely differentiated into a separate emotion.

This illustration, roughly as it is sketched, will show what we mean by the use of comparative
psychology in aid of classification. Ascertaining by induction the actual order of evolution
of the emotions, we are led to suspect this to be their order of successive dependence; and
are so led to recognize their order of ascending complexity; and by consequence their true
groupings.

Thus, in the very process of arranging the emotions into grades, beginning with those involved
in the lowest forms of conscious activity and ending with those peculiar to the adult civilized
man, the way is opened for that ultimate analysis which alone can lead us to the true science
of the matter. For when we find both that there exist in a man feelings which do not exist
in a child, and that the European is characterized by some sentiments which are wholly or in
great part absent from the savage--when we see that, besides the new emotions which arise spontaneously
as the individual becomes completely organized, there are new emotions making their appearance
in the more advanced divisions of our race; we are led to ask--How are new emotions generated?
The lowest savages have not even the ideas of justice or mercy: they have neither words for
them nor can they be made to conceive them; and the manifestation of them by Europeans they
ascribe to fear or cunning. There are æsthetic emotions common among ourselves, which are scarcely
in any degree experienced by some inferior races; as, for instance, those produced by music.
To which instances may be added the less marked but more numerous contrasts that exist between
civilized races in the degrees of their several emotions. And if it is manifest, both that
all the emotions are capable of being permanently modified in the course of successive generations,
and that what must be classed as new emotions may be brought into existence; then it follows
that nothing like a true conception of the emotions is to be obtained, until we understand
how they are evolved.

Comparative Psychology, while it raises this inquiry, prepares the way for answering it. When
observing the differences between races, we can scarcely fail to observe also how these differences
correspond with differences between their conditions of existence, and consequent activities.
Among the lowest races of men, love of property stimulates to the obtainment only of such things
as satisfy immediate desires, or desires of the immediate future. Improvidence is the rule:
there is little effort to meet remote contingencies. But the growth of established societies
having gradually given security of possession, there has been an increasing tendency to provide
for coming years: there has been a constant exercise of the feeling which is satisfied by a
provision for the future; and there has been a growth of this feeling so great that it now
prompts accumulation to an extent beyond what is needful. Note, again, that under the discipline
of social life--under a comparative abstinence from aggressive actions, and a performance of
those naturally-serviceable actions implied by the division of labour--there has been a development
of those gentle emotions of which inferior races exhibit but the rudiments. Savages delight
in giving pain rather than pleasure--are almost devoid of sympathy; while among ourselves,
philanthropy organizes itself in laws, establishes numerous institutions, and dictates countless
private benefactions.

From which and other like facts, does it not seem an unavoidable inference, that new emotions
are developed by new experiences--new habits of life? All are familiar with the truth that,
in the individual, each feeling may be strengthened by performing those actions which it prompts;
and to say that the feeling is strengthened, is to say that it is in part made by these actions.
We know, further, that not unfrequently, individuals, by persistence in special courses of
conduct, acquire special likings for such courses, disagreeable as these may be to others;
and these whims, or morbid tastes, imply incipient emotions corresponding to these special
activities. We know that emotional characteristics, in common with all others, are hereditary;
and the differences between civilized nations descended from the same stock, show us the cumulative
results of small modifications hereditarily transmitted. And when we see that between savage
and civilized races which diverged from one another in the remote past, and have for a hundred
generations followed modes of life becoming ever more unlike, there exist still greater emotional
contrasts; may we not infer that the more or less distinct emotions which characterize civilized
races, are the organized results of certain daily-repeated combinations of mental states which
social life involves? Must we not say that habits not only modify emotions in the individual,
and not only beget tendencies to like habits and accompanying emotions in descendants, but
that when the conditions of the race make the habits persistent, this progressive modification
may go on to the extent of producing emotions so far distinct as to seem new? And if so, we
may suspect that such new emotions, and by implication all emotions analytically considered,
consist of aggregated and consolidated groups of those simpler feelings which habitually occur
together in experience. When, in the circumstances of any race, some one kind of action or
set of actions, sensation or set of sensations, is usually followed, or accompanied, by various
other sets of actions or sensations, and so entails a large mass of pleasurable or painful
states of consciousness; these, by frequent repetition, become so connected together that the
initial action or sensation brings the ideas of all the rest crowding into consciousness: producing,
in some degree, the pleasures or pains that have before been felt in reality. And when this
relation, besides being frequently repeated in the individual, occurs in successive generations,
all the many nervous actions involved tend to grow organically connected. They become incipiently
reflex; and, on the occurrence of the appropriate stimulus, the whole nervous apparatus which
in past generations was brought into activity by this stimulus, becomes nascently excited.
Even while yet there have been no individual experiences, a vague feeling of pleasure or pain
is produced; constituting what we may call the body of the emotion. And when the experiences
of past generations come to be repeated in the individual, the emotion gains both strength
and definiteness; and is accompanied by the appropriate specific ideas.

This view of the matter, which we believe the established truths of Physiology and Psychology
unite in indicating, and which is the view that generalizes the phenomena of habit, of national
characteristics, of civilization in its moral aspects, at the same time that it gives us a
conception of emotion in its origin and ultimate nature, may be illustrated from the mental
modifications undergone by animals. On newly-discovered lands not inhabited by man, birds are
so devoid of fear as to allow themselves to be knocked over with sticks; but in the course
of generations, they acquire such a dread of man as to fly on his approach; and this dread
is manifested by young as well as by old. Now unless this change be ascribed to the killing-off
of the less fearful, and the preservation and multiplication of the more fearful, which, considering
the comparatively small number killed by man, is an inadequate cause; it must be ascribed to
accumulated experiences; and each experience must be held to have a share in producing it.
We must conclude that in each bird which escapes with injuries inflicted by man, or is alarmed
by the outcries of other members of the flock (gregarious creatures of any intelligence being
necessarily more or less sympathetic), there is established an association of ideas between
the human aspect and the pains, direct and indirect, suffered from human agency. And we must
further conclude that the state of consciousness which impels the bird to take flight, is at
first nothing more than an ideal reproduction of those painful impressions which before followed
man's approach; that such ideal reproduction becomes more vivid and more massive as the painful
experiences, direct or sympathetic, increase; and that thus the emotion in its incipient state,
is nothing else than an aggregation of the revived pains before experienced. As, in the course
of generations, the young birds of this race begin to display a fear of man before yet they
have been injured by him, it is an unavoidable inference that the nervous system of the race
has been organically modified by these experiences: we have no choice but to conclude that
when a young bird is thus led to fly, it is because the impression produced on its senses by
the approaching man, entails, through an incipiently-reflex action, a partial excitement of
all those nerves which in its ancestors had been excited under the like conditions; that this
partial excitement has its accompanying painful consciousness; and that the vague painful consciousness
thus arising, constitutes emotion proper--emotion undecomposable into specific experiences,
and therefore seemingly homogeneous.

If such be the explanation of the fact in this case, then it is in all cases. If emotion is
so generated here, then it is so generated throughout. We must perforce conclude that the emotional
modifications displayed by different nations, and those higher emotions by which civilized
are distinguished from savage, are to be accounted for on the same principle. And concluding
this, we are led strongly to suspect that the emotions in general have severally thus originated.

Perhaps we have now made sufficiently clear what we mean by the study of the emotions through
analysis and development. We have aimed to justify the positions that, without analysis aided
by development, there cannot be a true natural history of the emotions; and that a natural
history of the emotions based on external characters can be but provisional. We think that
Mr. Bain, in confining himself to an account of the emotions as they exist in the adult civilized
man, has neglected those classes of facts out of which the science of the matter must chiefly
be built. It is true that he has treated of habits as modifying emotions in the individual;
but he has not recognized the fact that where conditions render habits persistent in successive
generations, such modifications are cumulative: he has not hinted that the modifications produced
by habit are emotions in the making. It is true, also, that he occasionally refers to the characteristics
of children; but he does not systematically trace the changes through which childhood passes
into manhood, as throwing light on the order and genesis of the emotions. It is further true
that he here and there refers to national traits in illustration of his subject; but these
stand as isolated facts, having no general significance: there is no hint of any relation between
them and the national circumstances; while all those many moral contrasts between lower and
higher races which throw great light on classification, are passed over. And once more, it
is true that many passages of his work, and sometimes, indeed, whole sections of it, are analytical;
but his analyses are incidental--they do not underlie his entire scheme, but are here and there
added to it. In brief, he has written a Descriptive Psychology, which does not appeal to Comparative
Psychology and Analytical Psychology for its leading ideas. And in doing this, he has omitted
much that should be included in a natural history of the mind; while to that part of the subject
with which he has dealt, he has given a necessarily-imperfect organization.

       *       *       *       *       *

Even leaving out of view the absence of those methods and criteria on which we have been insisting,
it appears to us that meritorious as is Mr. Bain's book in its details, it is defective in
some of its leading ideas. The first paragraphs of his first chapter, quite startled us by
the strangeness of their definitions--a strangeness which can scarcely be ascribed to laxity
of expression. The paragraphs run thus:--

     "Mind is comprised under three heads,--Emotion, Volition, and
     Intellect.

     "EMOTION is the name here used to comprehend all that is understood
     by feelings, states of feeling, pleasures, pains, passions,
     sentiments, affections. Consciousness, and conscious states also
     for the most part denote modes of emotion, although there is such a
     thing as the Intellectual consciousness.

     "VOLITION, on the other hand, indicates the great fact that our
     Pleasures and Pains, which are not the whole of our emotions,
     prompt to action, or stimulate the active machinery of the living
     framework to perform such operations as procure the first and abate
     the last. To withdraw from a scalding heat, and cling to a gentle
     warmth, are exercises of volition."

The last of these definitions, which we may most conveniently take first, seems to us very
faulty. We cannot but feel astonished that Mr. Bain, familiar as he is with the phenomena of
reflex action, should have so expressed himself as to include a great part of them along with
the phenomena of volition. He seems to be ignoring the discriminations of modern science, and
returning to the vague conceptions of the past--nay more, he is comprehending under volition
what even the popular speech would hardly bring under it. If you were to blame any one for
snatching his foot from the scalding water into which he had inadvertently put it, he would
tell you that he could not help it; and his reply would be indorsed by the general experience,
that the withdrawal of a limb from contact with something extremely hot, is quite involuntary--that
it takes place not only without volition, but in defiance of an effort of will to maintain
the contact. How, then, can that be instanced as an example of volition, which occurs even
when volition is antagonistic? We are quite aware that it is impossible to draw any absolute
line of demarcation between automatic actions and actions which are not automatic. Doubtless
we may pass gradually from the purely reflex, through the consensual, to the voluntary. Taking
the case Mr. Bain cites, it is manifest that from a heat of such moderate degree that the withdrawal
from it is wholly voluntary, we may advance by infinitesimal steps to a heat which compels
involuntary withdrawal; and that there is a stage at which the voluntary and involuntary actions
are mixed. But the difficulty of absolute discrimination is no reason for neglecting the broad
general contrast; any more than it is for confounding light with darkness. Indeed, we must
confess ourselves at a loss. On the one hand if he does not mean it, his expression is lax
to a degree that surprises us in so careful a writer. On the other hand, if he does mean it,
we cannot understand his point of view.

A parallel criticism applies to his definition of Emotion. Here, too, he has departed from
the ordinary acceptation of the word; and, as we think, in the wrong direction. Whatever may
be the interpretation that is justified by its derivation, the word emotion has come generally
to mean that kind of feeling which is not a direct result of any action on the organism; but
is either an indirect result of such action, or arises quite apart from such action. It is
used to indicate those sentient states which are independently generated in consciousness;
as distinguished from those generated in our corporeal framework, and known as sensations.
Now this distinction, tacitly made in common speech, is one which Psychology cannot well reject;
but one which it must adopt, and to which it must give scientific precision. Mr. Bain, however,
appears to ignore any such distinction. Under the term emotion, he includes not only passions,
sentiments, affections, but all "feelings, states of feeling, pleasures, pains,"--that is,
all sensations. This does not appear to be a mere lapse of expression; for when, in the opening
sentence, he asserts that "mind is comprised under the three heads--Emotion, Volition, and
Intellect," he of necessity implies that sensation is included under one of these heads; and
as it cannot be included under volition or intellect, it must be classed with emotion; as it
clearly is in the next sentence.

We cannot but think this a retrograde step. Though distinctions which have been established
in popular thought and language, are not unfrequently merged in the higher generalizations
of science (as, for instance, when crabs and worms are grouped together in the sub-kingdom
Annulosa); yet science very generally recognizes the validity of these distinctions, as real
though not fundamental. And so in the present case. Such community as analysis discloses between
sensation and emotion, must not shut out the broad contrast that exists between them. If there
needs a wider word, as there does, to signify any sentient state whatever; then we may fitly
adopt for this purpose the word currently so used, namely, "Feeling." And considering as Feelings
all that great division of mental states which we do not class as Cognitions, we may then separate
this great division into the two orders, Sensations and Emotions.

       *       *       *       *       *

And here we may, before concluding, briefly indicate the leading outlines of a classification
which reduces this distinction to a scientific form, and develops it somewhat further--a classification
which, while suggested by certain fundamental traits reached without a very lengthened inquiry,
is yet, we believe, in harmony with that disclosed by detailed analysis.

Leaving out of view the Will, which is a simple homogeneous mental state, forming the link
between feeling and action, and not admitting of subdivisions; our states of consciousness
fall into two great classes--COGNITIONS and FEELINGS.

COGNITIONS, or those modes of mind in which we are occupied with the relations that subsist
among our feelings, are divisible into four great sub-classes.

Presentative cognitions; or those in which consciousness is occupied in localizing a sensation
impressed on the organism--occupied, that is, with the relation between this presented mental
state and those other presented mental states which make up our consciousness of the part affected:
as when we cut ourselves.

Presentative-representative cognitions; or those in which consciousness is occupied with the
relation between a sensation or group of sensations and the representations of those various
other sensations that accompany it in experience. This is what we commonly call perception--an
act in which, along with certain impressions presented to consciousness, there arise in consciousness
the ideas of certain other impressions ordinarily connected with the presented ones: as when
its visible form and colour, lead us to mentally endow an orange with all its other attributes.

Representative cognitions; or those in which consciousness is occupied with the relations among
ideas or represented sensations; as in all acts of recollection.

Re-representative cognitions; or those in which the occupation of consciousness is not by representation
of special relations that have before been presented to consciousness; but those in which such
represented special relations are thought of merely as comprehended in a general relation--those
in which the concrete relations once experienced, in so far as they become objects of consciousness
at all, are incidentally represented, along with the abstract relation which formulates them.
The ideas resulting from this abstraction, do not themselves represent actual experiences;
but are symbols which stand for groups of such actual experiences--represent aggregates of
representations. And thus they may be called re-representative cognitions. It is clear that
the process of re-representation is carried to higher stages, as the thought becomes more abstract.

FEELINGS, or those modes of mind in which we are occupied, not with the relations subsisting
between our sentient states, but with the sentient states themselves, are divisible into four
parallel sub-classes.

Presentative feelings, ordinarily called sensations, are those mental states in which, instead
of regarding a corporeal impression as of this or that kind, or as located here or there, we
contemplate it in itself as pleasure or pain: as when eating.

Presentative-representative feelings, embracing a great part of what we commonly call emotions,
are those in which a sensation, or group of sensations, or group of sensations and ideas, arouses
a vast aggregation of represented sensations; partly of individual experience, but chiefly
deeper than individual experience, and, consequently, indefinite. The emotion of terror may
serve as an example. Along with certain impressions made on the eyes or ears, or both, are
recalled in consciousness many of the pains to which such impressions have before been the
antecedents; and when the relation between such impressions and such pains has been habitual
in the race, the definite ideas of such pains which individual experience has given, are accompanied
by the indefinite pains that result from inherited effects of experiences--vague feelings which
we may call organic representations. In an infant, crying at a strange sight or sound while
yet in the nurse's arms, we see these organic representations called into existence in the
shape of dim discomfort, to which individual experience has yet given no specific outlines.

Representative feelings, comprehending the ideas of the feelings above classed, when they are
called up apart from the appropriate external excitements. As instances of these may be named
the feelings with which the descriptive poet writes, and which are aroused in the minds of
his readers.

Re-representative feelings, under which head are included those more complex sentient states
that are less the direct results of external excitements than the indirect or reflex results
of them. The love of property is a feeling of this kind. It is awakened not by the presence
of any special object, but by ownable objects at large; and it is not from the mere presence
of such object, but from a certain ideal relation to them, that it arises. As before shown
(p. 253) it consists, not of the represented advantages of possessing this or that, but of
the represented advantages of possession in general--is not made up of certain concrete representations,
but of the abstracts of many concrete representations; and so is re-representative. The higher
sentiments, as that of justice, are still more completely of this nature. Here the sentient
state is compounded out of sentient states that are themselves wholly, or almost wholly, re-representative:
it involves representations of those lower emotions which are produced by the possession of
property, by freedom of action, etc.; and thus is re-representative in a higher degree.

This classification, here roughly indicated and capable of further expansion, will be found
in harmony with the results of detailed analysis aided by development. Whether we trace mental
progression through the grades of the animal kingdom, through the grades of mankind, or through
the stages of individual growth; it is obvious that the advance, alike in cognitions and feelings,
is, and must be, from the presentative to the more and more remotely representative. It is
undeniable that intelligence ascends from those simple perceptions in which consciousness is
occupied in localizing and classifying sensations, to perceptions more and more compound, to
simple reasoning, to reasoning more and more complex and abstract--more and more remote from
sensation. And in the evolution of feelings, there is a parallel series of steps. Simple sensations;
sensations combined together; sensations combined with represented sensations; represented
sensations organized into groups, in which their separate characters are very much merged;
representations of these representative groups, in which the original components have become
still more vague. In both cases, the progress has necessarily been from the simple and concrete
to the complex and abstract; and as with the cognitions, so with the feelings, this must be
the basis of classification.

The space here occupied with criticisms on Mr. Bain's work, we might have filled with exposition
and eulogy, had we thought this the more important. Though we have freely pointed out what
we conceive to be its defects, let it not be inferred that we question its great merits. We
repeat that, as a natural history of the mind, we believe it to be the best yet produced. It
is a most valuable collection of carefully-elaborated materials. Perhaps we cannot better express
our sense of its worth, than by saying that, to those who hereafter give to this branch of
Psychology a thoroughly scientific organization, Mr. Bain's book will be indispensable.

THE SOCIAL ORGANISM.

    [First published in The Westminster Review for January, 1860.]

Sir James Macintosh got great credit for the saying, that "constitutions are not made, but
grow." In our day, the most significant thing about this saying is, that it was ever thought
so significant. As from the surprise displayed by a man at some familiar fact, you may judge
of his general culture; so from the admiration which an age accords to a new thought, its average
degree of enlightenment may be inferred. That this apophthegm of Macintosh should have been
quoted and requoted as it has, shows how profound has been the ignorance of social science.
A small ray of truth has seemed brilliant, as a distant rushlight looks like a star in the
surrounding darkness.

Such a conception could not, indeed, fail to be startling when let fall in the midst of a system
of thought to which it was utterly alien. Universally in Macintosh's day, things were explained
on the hypothesis of manufacture, rather than that of growth; as indeed they are, by the majority,
in our own day. It was held that the planets were severally projected round the Sun from the
Creator's hand, with just the velocity required to balance the Sun's attraction. The formation
of the Earth, the separation of sea from land, the production of animals, were mechanical works
from which God rested as a labourer rests. Man was supposed to be moulded after a manner somewhat
akin to that in which a modeller makes a clay-figure. And of course, in harmony with such ideas,
societies were tacitly assumed to be arranged thus or thus by direct interposition of Providence;
or by the regulations of law-makers; or by both.

Yet that societies are not artificially put together, is a truth so manifest, that it seems
wonderful men should ever have overlooked it. Perhaps nothing more clearly shows the small
value of historical studies, as they have been commonly pursued. You need but to look at the
changes going on around, or observe social organization in its leading traits, to see that
these are neither supernatural, nor are determined by the wills of individual men, as by implication
the older historians teach; but are consequent on general natural causes. The one case of the
division of labour suffices to prove this. It has not been by command of any ruler that some
men have become manufacturers, while others have remained cultivators of the soil. In Lancashire,
millions have devoted themselves to the making of cotton-fabrics; in Yorkshire, another million
lives by producing woollens; and the pottery of Staffordshire, the cutlery of Sheffield, the
hardware of Birmingham, severally occupy their hundreds of thousands. These are large facts
in the structure of English society; but we can ascribe them neither to miracle, nor to legislation.
It is not by "the hero as king," any more than by "collective wisdom," that men have been segregated
into producers, wholesale distributors, and retail distributors. Our industrial organization,
from its main outlines down to its minutest details, has become what it is, not simply without
legislative guidance, but, to a considerable extent, in spite of legislative hindrances. It
has arisen under the pressure of human wants and resulting activities. While each citizen has
been pursuing his individual welfare, and none taking thought about division of labour, or
conscious of the need of it, division of labour has yet been ever becoming more complete. It
has been doing this slowly and silently: few having observed it until quite modern times. By
steps so small, that year after year the industrial arrangements have seemed just what they
were before--by changes as insensible as those through which a seed passes into a tree; society
has become the complex body of mutually-dependent workers which we now see. And this economic
organization, mark, is the all-essential organization. Through the combination thus spontaneously
evolved, every citizen is supplied with daily necessaries; while he yields some product or
aid to others. That we are severally alive to-day, we owe to the regular working of this combination
during the past week; and could it be suddenly abolished, multitudes would be dead before another
week ended. If these most conspicuous and vital arrangements of our social structure have arisen
not by the devising of any one, but through the individual efforts of citizens to satisfy their
own wants; we may be tolerably certain that the less important arrangements have similarly arisen.

"But surely," it will be said, "the social changes directly produced by law, cannot be classed
as spontaneous growths. When parliaments or kings order this or that thing to be done, and
appoint officials to do it, the process is clearly artificial; and society to this extent becomes
a manufacture rather than a growth." No, not even these changes are exceptions, if they be
real and permanent changes. The true sources of such changes lie deeper than the acts of legislators.
To take first the simplest instance. We all know that the enactments of representative governments
ultimately depend on the national will: they may for a time be out of harmony with it, but
eventually they must conform to it. And to say that the national will finally determines them,
is to say that they result from the average of individual desires; or, in other words--from
the average of individual natures. A law so initiated, therefore, really grows out of the popular
character. In the case of a Government representing a dominant class, the same thing holds,
though not so manifestly. For the very existence of a class monopolizing all power, is due
to certain sentiments in the commonalty. Without the feeling of loyalty on the part of retainers,
a feudal system could not exist. We see in the protest of the Highlanders against the abolition
of heritable jurisdictions, that they preferred that kind of local rule. And if to the popular
nature must be ascribed the growth of an irresponsible ruling class; then to the popular nature
must be ascribed the social arrangements which that class creates in the pursuit of its own
ends. Even where the Government is despotic, the doctrine still holds. The character of the
people is, as before, the original source of this political form; and, as we have abundant
proof, other forms suddenly created will not act, but rapidly retrograde to the old form. Moreover,
such regulations as a despot makes, if really operative, are so because of their fitness to
the social state. His acts being very much swayed by general opinion--by precedent, by the
feeling of his nobles, his priesthood, his army--are in part immediate results of the national
character; and when they are out of harmony with the national character, they are soon practically
abrogated. The failure of Cromwell permanently to establish a new social condition, and the
rapid revival of suppressed institutions and practices after his death, show how powerless
is a monarch to change the type of the society he governs. He may disturb, he may retard, or
he may aid the natural process of organization; but the general course of this process is beyond
his control. Nay, more than this is true. Those who regard the histories of societies as the
histories of their great men, and think that these great men shape the fates of their societies,
overlook the truth that such great men are the products of their societies. Without certain
antecedents--without a certain average national character, they neither could have been generated
nor could have had the culture which formed them. If their society is to some extent re-moulded
by them, they were, both before and after birth, moulded by their society--were the results
of all those influences which fostered the ancestral character they inherited, and gave their
own early bias, their creed, morals, knowledge, aspirations. So that such social changes as
are immediately traceable to individuals of unusual power, are still remotely traceable to
the social causes which produced these individuals; and hence, from the highest point of view,
such social changes also, are parts of the general developmental process.

Thus that which is so obviously true of the industrial structure of society, is true of its
whole structure. The fact that "constitutions are not made, but grow," is simply a fragment
of the much larger fact, that under all its aspects and through all its ramifications, society
is a growth and not a manufacture.

       *       *       *       *       *

A perception that there exists some analogy between the body politic and a living individual
body, was early reached; and has from time to time re-appeared in literature. But this perception
was necessarily vague and more or less fanciful. In the absence of physiological science, and
especially of those comprehensive generalizations which it has but lately reached, it was impossible
to discern the real parallelisms.

The central idea of Plato's model Republic, is the correspondence between the parts of a society
and the faculties of the human mind. Classifying these faculties under the heads of Reason,
Will, and Passion, he classifies the members of his ideal society under what he regards as
three analogous heads:--councillors, who are to exercise government; military or executive,
who are to fulfil their behests; and the commonalty, bent on gain and selfish gratification.
In other words, the ruler, the warrior, and the craftsman, are, according to him, the analogues
of our reflective, volitional, and emotional powers. Now even were there truth in the implied
assumption of a parallelism between the structure of a society and that of a man, this classification
would be indefensible. It might more truly be contended that, as the military power obeys the
commands of the Government, it is the Government which answers to the Will; while the military
power is simply an agency set in motion by it. Or, again, it might be contended that whereas
the Will is a product of predominant desires, to which the Reason serves merely as an eye,
it is the craftsmen, who, according to the alleged analogy, ought to be the moving power of
the warriors.

Hobbes sought to establish a still more definite parallelism: not, however, between a society
and the human mind, but between a society and the human body. In the introduction to the work
in which he develops this conception, he says--

     "For by art is created that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMONWEALTH,
     or STATE, in Latin CIVITAS, which is but an artificial man; though
     of greater stature and strength than the natural, for whose
     protection and defence it was intended, and in which the
     sovereignty is an artificial soul, as giving life and motion to
     the whole body; the magistrates and other officers of
     judicature and execution, artificial joints; reward and
     punishment, by which, fastened to the seat of the sovereignty,
     every joint and member is moved to perform his duty, are the
     nerves, that do the same in the body natural; the wealth and
     riches of all the particular members are the strength; salus
     populi, the people's safety, its business; counsellors, by
     whom all things needful for it to know are suggested unto it, are
     the memory; equity and laws an artificial reason and
     will; concord, health; sedition, sickness; and civil
     war, death."

And Hobbes carries this comparison so far as actually to give a drawing of the Leviathan--a
vast human-shaped figure, whose body and limbs are made up of multitudes of men. Just noting
that these different analogies asserted by Plato and Hobbes, serve to cancel each other (being,
as they are, so completely at variance), we may say that on the whole those of Hobbes are the
more plausible. But they are full of inconsistencies. If the sovereignty is the soul of the
body-politic, how can it be that magistrates, who are a kind of deputy-sovereigns, should be
comparable to joints? Or, again, how can the three mental functions, memory, reason, and will,
be severally analogous, the first to counsellors, who are a class of public officers, and the
other two to equity and laws, which are not classes of officers, but abstractions? Or, once
more, if magistrates are the artificial joints of society, how can reward and punishment be
its nerves? Its nerves must surely be some class of persons. Reward and punishment must in
societies, as in individuals, be conditions of the nerves, and not the nerves themselves.

But the chief errors of these comparisons made by Plato and Hobbes, lie much deeper. Both thinkers
assume that the organization of a society is comparable, not simply to the organization of
a living body in general, but to the organization of the human body in particular. There is
no warrant whatever for assuming this. It is in no way implied by the evidence; and is simply
one of those fancies which we commonly find mixed up with the truths of early speculation.
Still more erroneous are the two conceptions in this, that they construe a society as an artificial
structure. Plato's model republic--his ideal of a healthful body-politic--is to be consciously
put together by men, just as a watch might be; and Plato manifestly thinks of societies in
general as thus originated. Quite specifically does Hobbes express a like view. "For by art,"
he says, "is created that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMONWEALTH." And he even goes so far as
to compare the supposed social contract, from which a society suddenly originates, to the creation
of a man by the divine fiat. Thus they both fall into the extreme inconsistency of considering
a community as similar in structure to a human being, and yet as produced in the same way as
an artificial mechanism--in nature, an organism; in history, a machine.

Notwithstanding errors, however, these speculations have considerable significance. That such
likenesses, crudely as they are thought out, should have been alleged by Plato and Hobbes and
others, is a reason for suspecting that some analogy exists. The untenableness of the particular
parallelisms above instanced, is no ground for denying an essential parallelism; since early
ideas are usually but vague adumbrations of the truth. Lacking the great generalizations of
biology, it was, as we have said, impossible to trace out the real relations of social organizations
to organizations of another order. We propose here to show what are the analogies which modern
science discloses.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let us set out by succinctly stating the points of similarity and the points of difference.
Societies agree with individual organisms in four conspicuous peculiarities:--

1. That commencing as small aggregations, they insensibly augment in mass: some of them eventually
reaching ten thousand times what they originally were.

2. That while at first so simple in structure as to be considered structureless, they assume,
in the course of their growth, a continually-increasing complexity of structure.

3. That though in their early, undeveloped states, there exists in them scarcely any mutual
dependence of parts, their parts gradually acquire a mutual dependence; which becomes at last
so great, that the activity and life of each part is made possible only by the activity and
life of the rest.

4. That the life of a society is independent of, and far more prolonged than, the lives of
any of its component units; who are severally born, grow, work, reproduce, and die, while the
body-politic composed of them survives generation after generation, increasing in mass, in
completeness of structure, and in functional activity.

These four parallelisms will appear the more significant the more we contemplate them. While
the points specified, are points in which societies agree with individual organisms, they are
also points in which individual organisms agree with one another, and disagree with all things
else. In the course of its existence, every plant and animal increases in mass, in a way not
paralleled by inorganic objects: even such inorganic objects as crystals, which arise by growth,
show us no such definite relation between growth and existence as organisms do. The orderly
progress from simplicity to complexity, displayed by bodies-politic in common with living bodies,
is a characteristic which distinguishes living bodies from the inanimate bodies amid which
they move. That functional dependence of parts, which is scarcely more manifest in animals
than in nations, has no counterpart elsewhere. And in no aggregate except an organic or a social
one, is there a perpetual removal and replacement of parts, joined with a continued integrity
of the whole. Moreover, societies and organisms are not only alike in these peculiarities,
in which they are unlike all other things; but the highest societies, like the highest organisms,
exhibit them in the greatest degree. We see that the lowest animals do not increase to anything
like the sizes of the higher ones; and, similarly, we see that aboriginal societies are comparatively
limited in their growths. In complexity, our large civilized nations as much exceed primitive
savage tribes, as a mammal does a zoophyte. Simple communities, like simple creatures, have
so little mutual dependence of parts, that mutilation or subdivision causes but little inconvenience;
but from complex communities, as from complex creatures, you cannot remove any considerable
organ without producing great disturbance or death of the rest. And in societies of low type,
as in inferior animals, the life of the aggregate, often cut short by division or dissolution,
exceeds in length the lives of the component units, very far less than in civilized communities
and superior animals; which outlive many generations of their component units.

On the other hand, the leading differences between societies and individual organisms are these:--

1. That societies have no specific external forms. This, however, is a point of contrast which
loses much of its importance, when we remember that throughout the vegetal kingdom, as well
as in some lower divisions of the animal kingdom, the forms are often very indefinite--definiteness
being rather the exception than the rule; and that they are manifestly in part determined by
surrounding physical circumstances, as the forms of societies are. If, too, it should eventually
be shown, as we believe it will, that the form of every species of organism has resulted from
the average play of the external forces to which it has been subject during its evolution as
a species; then, that the external forms of societies should depend, as they do, on surrounding
conditions, will be a further point of community.

2. That though the living tissue whereof an individual organism consists, forms a continuous
mass, the living elements of a society do not form a continuous mass; but are more or less
widely dispersed over some portion of the Earth's surface. This, which at first sight appears
to be an absolute distinction, is one which yet to a great extent fades when we contemplate
all the facts. For, in the lower divisions of the animal and vegetal kingdoms, there are types
of organization much more nearly allied, in this respect, to the organization of a society,
than might be supposed--types in which the living units essentially composing the mass, are
dispersed through an inert substance, that can scarcely be called living in the full sense
of the word. It is thus with some of the Protococci and with the Nostoceæ, which exist as cells
imbedded in a viscid matter. It is so, too, with the Thalassicollæ--bodies made up of differentiated
parts, dispersed through an undifferentiated jelly. And throughout considerable portions of
their bodies, some of the Acalephæ exhibit more or less this type of structure. Now this is
very much the case with a society. For we must remember that though the men who make up a society
are physically separate, and even scattered, yet the surface over which they are scattered
is not one devoid of life, but is covered by life of a lower order which ministers to their
life. The vegetation which clothes a country makes possible the animal life in that country;
and only through its animal and vegetal products can such a country support a society. Hence
the members of the body-politic are not to be regarded as separated by intervals of dead space,
but as diffused through a space occupied by life of a lower order. In our conception of a social
organism, we must include all that lower organic existence on which human existence, and therefore
social existence, depend. And when we do this, we see that the citizens who make up a community
may be considered as highly vitalized units surrounded by substances of lower vitality, from
which they draw their nutriment: much as in the cases above instanced.

3. The third difference is that while the ultimate living elements of an individual organism
are mostly fixed in their relative positions, those of the social organism are capable of moving
from place to place. But here, too, the disagreement is much less than would be supposed. For
while citizens are locomotive in their private capacities, they are fixed in their public capacities.
As farmers, manufacturers, or traders, men carry on their businesses at the same spots, often
throughout their whole lives; and if they go away occasionally, they leave behind others to
discharge their functions in their absence. Each great centre of production, each manufacturing
town or district, continues always in the same place; and many of the firms in such town or
district, are for generations carried on either by the descendants or successors of those who
founded them. Just as in a living body, the cells that make up some important organ severally
perform their functions for a time and then disappear, leaving others to supply their places;
so, in each part of a society the organ remains, though the persons who compose it change.
Thus, in social life, as in the life of an animal, the units as well as the larger agencies
formed of them, are in the main stationary as respects the places where they discharge their
duties and obtain their sustenance. And hence the power of individual locomotion does not practically
affect the analogy.

4. The last and perhaps the most important distinction is, that while in the body of an animal
only a special tissue is endowed with feeling, in a society all the members are endowed with
feeling. Even this distinction, however, is not a complete one. For in some of the lowest animals,
characterized by the absence of a nervous system, such sensitiveness as exists is possessed
by all parts. It is only in the more organized forms that feeling is monopolized by one class
of the vital elements. And we must remember that societies, too, are not without a certain
differentiation of this kind. Though the units of a community are all sensitive, they are so
in unequal degrees. The classes engaged in laborious occupations are less susceptible, intellectually
and emotionally, than the rest; and especially less so than the classes of highest mental culture.
Still, we have here a tolerably decided contrast between bodies-politic and individual bodies;
and it is one which we should keep constantly in view. For it reminds us that while, in individual
bodies, the welfare of all other parts is rightly subservient to the welfare of the nervous
system, whose pleasurable or painful activities make up the good or ill of life; in bodies-politic
the same thing does not hold, or holds to but a very slight extent. It is well that the lives
of all parts of an animal should be merged in the life of the whole, because the whole has
a corporate consciousness capable of happiness or misery. But it is not so with a society;
since its living units do not and cannot lose individual consciousness, and since the community
as a whole has no corporate consciousness. This is an everlasting reason why the welfares of
citizens cannot rightly be sacrificed to some supposed benefit of the State, and why, on the
other hand, the State is to be maintained solely for the benefit of citizens. The corporate
life must here be subservient to the lives of the parts, instead of the lives of the parts
being subservient to the corporate life.

Such, then, are the points of analogy and the points of difference. May we not say that the
points of difference serve but to bring into clearer light the points of analogy? While comparison
makes definite the obvious contrasts between organisms commonly so called, and the social organism,
it shows that even these contrasts are not so decided as was to be expected. The indefiniteness
of form, the discontinuity of the parts, and the universal sensitiveness, are not only peculiarities
of the social organism which have to be stated with considerable qualifications; but they are
peculiarities to which the inferior classes of animals present approximations. Thus we find
but little to conflict with the all-important analogies. Societies slowly augment in mass;
they progress in complexity of structure; at the same time their parts become more mutually
dependent; their living units are removed and replaced without destroying their integrity;
and the extents to which they display these peculiarities are proportionate to their vital
activities. These are traits that societies have in common with organic bodies. And these traits
in which they agree with organic bodies and disagree with all other things, entirely subordinate
the minor distinctions: such distinctions being scarcely greater than those which separate
one half of the organic kingdom from the other. The principles of organization are the same,
and the differences are simply differences of application.

Here ending this general survey of the facts which justify the comparison of a society with
a living body, let us look at them in detail. We shall find that the parallelism becomes the
more marked the more closely it is examined.

       *       *       *       *       *

The lowest animal and vegetal forms--Protozoa and Protophyta--are chiefly inhabitants of the
water. They are minute bodies, most of which are made individually visible only by the microscope.
All of them are extremely simple in structure, and some of them, as the Rhizopods, almost structureless.
Multiplying, as they ordinarily do, by the spontaneous division of their bodies, they produce
halves which may either become quite separate and move away in different directions, or may
continue attached. By the repetition of this process of fission, aggregations of various sizes
and kinds are formed. Among the Protophyta we have some classes, as the Diatomaceæ and the
Yeast-plant, in which the individuals may be either separate or attached in groups of two,
three, four, or more; other classes in which a considerable number of cells are united into
a thread (Conferva, Monilia); others in which they form a network (Hydrodictyon); others in
which they form plates (Ulva); and others in which they form masses (Laminaria, Agaricus):
all which vegetal forms, having no distinction of root, stem, or leaf, are called Thallogens.
Among the Protozoa we find parallel facts. Immense numbers of Amoeba-like creatures, massed
together in a framework of horny fibres, constitute Sponge. In the Foraminifera we see smaller
groups of such creatures arranged into more definite shapes. Not only do these almost structureless
Protozoa unite into regular or irregular aggregations of various sizes, but among some of the
more organized ones, as the Vorticellæ, there are also produced clusters of individuals united
to a common stem. But these little societies of monads, or cells, or whatever else we may call
them, are societies only in the lowest sense: there is no subordination of parts among them--no
organization. Each of the component units lives by and for itself; neither giving nor receiving
aid. The only mutual dependence is that consequent on mechanical union.

Do we not here discern analogies to the first stages of human societies? Among the lowest races,
as the Bushmen, we find but incipient aggregation: sometimes single families, sometimes two
or three families wandering about together. The number of associated units is small and variable,
and their union inconstant. No division of labour exists except between the sexes, and the
only kind of mutual aid is that of joint attack or defence. We see an undifferentiated group
of individuals, forming the germ of a society; just as in the homogeneous groups of cells above
described, we see the initial stage of animal and vegetal organization.

The comparison may now be carried a step higher. In the vegetal kingdom we pass from the Thallogens,
consisting of mere masses of similar cells, to the Acrogens, in which the cells are not similar
throughout the whole mass; but are here aggregated into a structure serving as leaf and there
into a structure serving as root; thus forming a whole in which there is a certain subdivision
of functions among the units, and therefore a certain mutual dependence. In the animal kingdom
we find analogous progress. From mere unorganized groups of cells, or cell-like bodies, we
ascend to groups of such cells arranged into parts that have different duties. The common Polype,
from the substance of which may be separated cells that exhibit, when detached, appearances
and movements like those of a solitary Amoeba, illustrates this stage. The component units,
though still showing great community of character, assume somewhat diverse functions in the
skin, in the internal surface, and in the tentacles. There is a certain amount of "physiological
division of labour."

Turning to societies, we find these stages paralleled in most aboriginal tribes. When, instead
of such small variable groups as are formed by Bushmen, we come to the larger and more permanent
groups formed by savages not quite so low, we find traces of social structure. Though industrial
organization scarcely shows itself, except in the different occupations of the sexes; yet there
is more or less of governmental organization. While all the men are warriors and hunters, only
a part of them are included in the council of chiefs; and in this council of chiefs some one
has commonly supreme authority. There is thus a certain distinction of classes and powers;
and through this slight specialization of functions is effected a rude co-operation among the
increasing mass of individuals, whenever the society has to act in its corporate capacity. Both
we are about of system and him is being surprised in England had been of humane as it was not

 And if in the body-politic, some part has been stimulated into great productivity,
and cannot afterwards get paid for all its produce, certain of its members become bankrupt,
and it decreases in size.

One more parallelism to be here noted, is that the different parts of a social organism, like
the different parts of an individual organism, compete for nutriment; and severally obtain
more or less of it according as they are discharging more or less duty. If a man's brain be
overexcited it abstracts blood from his viscera and stops digestion; or digestion, actively
going on, so affects the circulation through the brain as to cause drowsiness; or great muscular
exertion determines such a quantity of blood to the limbs as to arrest digestion or cerebral
action, as the case may be. So, likewise, in a society, great activity in some one direction
causes partial arrests of activity elsewhere by abstracting capital, that is commodities: as
instance the way in which the sudden development of our railway-system hampered commercial
operations; or the way in which the raising of a large military force temporarily stops the
growth of leading industries.

       *       *       *       *       *

The last few paragraphs introduce the next division of our subject. Almost unawares we have
come upon the analogy which exists between the blood of a living body and the circulating mass
of commodities in the body-politic. We have now to trace out this analogy from its simplest
to its most complex manifestations.

In the lowest animals there exists no blood properly so called. Through the small assemblage
of cells which make up a Hydra, permeate the juices absorbed from the food. There is no apparatus
for elaborating a concentrated and purified nutriment, and distributing it among the component
units; but these component units directly imbibe the unprepared nutriment, either from the
digestive cavity or from one another. May we not say that this is what takes place in an aboriginal
tribe? All its members severally obtain for themselves the necessaries of life in their crude
states; and severally prepare them for their own uses as well as they can. When there arises
a decided differentiation between the governing and the governed, some amount of transfer begins
between those inferior individuals who, as workers, come directly in contact with the products
of the earth, and those superior ones who exercise the higher functions--a transfer parallel
to that which accompanies the differentiation of the ectoderm from the endoderm. In the one
case, as in the other, however, it is a transfer of products that are little if at all prepared;
and takes place directly from the unit which obtains to the unit which consumes, without entering
into any general current.

Passing to larger organisms--individual and social--we meet the first advance on this arrangement.
Where, as among the compound Hydrozoa, there is a union of many such primitive groups as form
Hydræ; or where, as in a Medusa, one of these groups has become of great size; there exist
rude channels running throughout the substance of the body: not, however, channels for the
conveyance of prepared nutriment, but mere prolongations of the digestive cavity, through which
the crude chyle-aqueous fluid reaches the remoter parts, and is moved backwards and forwards
by the creature's contractions. Do we not find in some of the more advanced primitive communities
an analogous condition? When the men, partially or fully united into one society, become numerous--when,
as usually happens, they cover a surface of country not everywhere alike in its products--when,
more especially, there arise considerable classes which are not industrial; some process of
exchange and distribution inevitably arises. Traversing here and there the earth's surface,
covered by that vegetation on which human life depends, and in which, as we say, the units
of a society are imbedded, there are formed indefinite paths, along which some of the necessaries
of life occasionally pass, to be bartered for others which presently come back along the same
channels. Note, however, that at first little else but crude commodities are thus transferred--fruits,
fish, pigs or cattle, skins, etc.: there are few, if any, manufactured products or articles
prepared for consumption. And note also, that such distribution of these unprepared necessaries
of life as takes place, is but occasional--goes on with a certain slow, irregular rhythm.

Further progress in the elaboration and distribution of nutriment, or of commodities, is a
necessary accompaniment of further differentiation of functions in the individual body or in
the body-politic. As fast as each organ of a living animal becomes confined to a special action,
it must become dependent on the rest for those materials which its position and duty do not
permit it to obtain for itself; in the same way that, as fast as each particular class of a
community becomes exclusively occupied in producing its own commodity, it must become dependent
on the rest for the other commodities it needs. And, simultaneously, a more perfectly-elaborated
blood will result from a highly specialized group of nutritive organs, severally adapted to
prepare its different elements; in the same way that the stream of commodities circulating
throughout a society, will be of superior quality in proportion to the greater division of
labour among the workers. Observe, also, that in either case the circulating mass of nutritive
materials, besides coming gradually to consist of better ingredients, also grows more complex.
An increase in the number of the unlike organs which add to the blood their waste matters,
and demand from it the different materials they severally need, implies a blood more heterogeneous
in composition--an a priori conclusion which, according to Dr. Williams, is inductively confirmed
by examination of the blood throughout the various grades of the animal kingdom. And similarly,
it is manifest that as fast as the division of labour among the classes of a community becomes
greater, there must be an increasing heterogeneity in the currents of merchandize flowing throughout
that community.

The circulating mass of nutritive materials in individual organisms and in social organisms,
becoming at once better in the quality of its ingredients and more heterogeneous in composition,
as the type of structure becomes higher, eventually has added to it in both cases another element,
which is not itself nutritive but facilitates the processes of nutrition. We refer, in the
case of the individual organism, to the blood-discs; and in the case of the social organism,
to money. This analogy has been observed by Liebig, who in his Familiar Letters on Chemistry
says:--

     "Silver and gold have to perform in the organism of the state, the
     same function as the blood-corpuscles in the human organism. As
     these round discs, without themselves taking an immediate share in
     the nutritive process, are the medium, the essential condition of
     the change of matter, of the production of the heat and of the
     force by which the temperature of the body is kept up, and the
     motions of the blood and all the juices are determined, so has gold
     become the medium of all activity in the life of the state."

And blood-corpuscles being like coin in their functions, and in the fact that they are not
consumed in nutrition, he further points out that the number of them which in a considerable
interval flows through the great centres, is enormous when compared with their absolute number;
just as the quantity of money which annually passes through the great mercantile centres, is
enormous when compared with the quantity of money in the kingdom. Nor is this all. Liebig has
omitted the significant circumstance that only at a certain stage of organization does this
element of the circulation make its appearance. Throughout extensive divisions of the lower
animals, the blood contains no corpuscles; and in societies of low civilization, there is no money.

Thus far we have considered the analogy between the blood in a living body and the consumable
and circulating commodities in the body-politic. Let us now compare the appliances by which
they are respectively distributed. We shall find in the developments of these appliances parallelisms
not less remarkable than those above set forth. Already we have shown that, as classes, wholesale
and retail distributors discharge in a society the office which the vascular system discharges
in an individual creature; that they come into existence later than the other two great classes,
as the vascular layer appears later than the mucous and serous layers; and that they occupy
a like intermediate position. Here, however, it remains to be pointed out that a complete conception
of the circulating system in a society, includes not only the active human agents who propel
the currents of commodities, and regulate their distribution, but includes, also, the channels
of communication. It is the formation and arrangement of these to which we now direct attention.

Going back once more to those lower animals in which there is found nothing but a partial diffusion,
not of blood, but only of crude nutritive fluids, it is to be remarked that the channels through
which the diffusion takes place, are mere excavations through the half-organized substance
of the body: they have no lining membranes, but are mere lacunæ traversing a rude tissue. Now
countries in which civilization is but commencing, display a like condition: there are no roads
properly so called; but the wilderness of vegetal life covering the earth's surface is pierced
by tracks, through which the distribution of crude commodities takes place. And while, in both
cases, the acts of distribution occur only at long intervals (the currents, after a pause,
now setting towards a general centre and now away from it), the transfer is in both cases slow
and difficult. But among other accompaniments of progress, common to animals and societies,
comes the formation of more definite and complete channels of communication. Blood-vessels
acquire distinct walls; roads are fenced and gravelled. This advance is first seen in those
roads or vessels that are nearest to the chief centres of distribution; while the peripheral
roads and peripheral vessels long continue in their primitive states. At a yet later stage
of development, where comparative finish of structure is found throughout the system as well
as near the chief centres, there remains in both cases the difference that the main channels
are comparatively broad and straight, while the subordinate ones are narrow and tortuous in
proportion to their remoteness. Lastly, it is to be remarked that there ultimately arise in
the higher social organisms, as in the higher individual organisms, main channels of distribution
still more distinguished by their perfect structures, their comparative straightness, and the
absence of those small branches which the minor channels perpetually give off. And in railways
we also see, for the first time in the social organism, a system of double channels conveying
currents in opposite directions, as do the arteries and veins of a well-developed animal.

These parallelisms in the evolutions and structures of the circulating systems, introduce us
to others in the kinds and rates of the movements going on through them. Through the lowest
societies, as through the lowest creatures, the distribution of crude nutriment is by slow
gurgitations and regurgitations. In creatures that have rude vascular systems, just as in societies
that are beginning to have roads, there is no regular circulation along definite courses; but,
instead, periodical changes of the currents--now towards this point and now towards that. Through
each part of an inferior mollusk's body, the blood flows for a while in one direction, then
stops and flows in the opposite direction; just as through a rudely-organized society, the
distribution of merchandize is slowly carried on by great fairs, occurring in different localities,
to and from which the currents periodically set. Only animals of tolerably complete organizations,
like advanced communities, are permeated by constant currents that are definitely directed.
In living bodies, the local and variable currents disappear when there grow up great centres
of circulation, generating more powerful currents by a rhythm which ends in a quick, regular
pulsation. And when in social bodies there arise great centres of commercial activity, producing
and exchanging large quantities of commodities, the rapid and continuous streams drawn in and
emitted by these centres subdue all minor and local circulations: the slow rhythm of fairs
merges into the faster one of weekly markets, and in the chief centres of distribution, weekly
markets merge into daily markets; while in place of the languid transfer from place to place,
taking place at first weekly, then twice or thrice a week, we by-and-by get daily transfer,
and finally transfer many times a day--the original sluggish, irregular rhythm, becomes a rapid,
equable pulse. Mark, too, that in both cases the increased activity, like the greater perfection
of structure, is much less conspicuous at the periphery of the vascular system. On main lines
of railway, we have, perhaps, a score trains in each direction daily, going at from thirty
to fifty miles an hour; as, through the great arteries, the blood moves rapidly in successive
gushes. Along high roads, there go vehicles conveying men and commodities with much less, though
still considerable, speed, and with a much less decided rhythm; as, in the smaller arteries,
the speed of the blood is greatly diminished and the pulse less conspicuous. In parish-roads,
narrower, less complete, and more tortuous, the rate of movement is further decreased and the
rhythm scarcely traceable; as in the ultimate arteries. In those still more imperfect by-roads
which lead from these parish-roads to scattered farmhouses and cottages, the motion is yet
slower and very irregular; just as we find it in the capillaries. While along the field-roads,
which, in their unformed, unfenced state, are typical of lacunæ, the movement is the slowest,
the most irregular, and the most infrequent; as it is, not only in the primitive lacunæ of
animals and societies, but as it is also in those lacunæ in which the vascular system ends
among extensive families of inferior creatures.

Thus, then, we find between the distributing systems of living bodies and the distributing
systems of bodies-politic, wonderfully close parallelisms. In the lowest forms of individual
and social organisms, there exist neither prepared nutritive matters nor distributing appliances;
and in both, these, arising as necessary accompaniments of the differentiation of parts, approach
perfection as this differentiation approaches completeness. In animals, as in societies, the
distributing agencies begin to show themselves at the same relative periods, and in the same
relative positions. In the one, as in the other, the nutritive materials circulated are at
first crude and simple, gradually become better elaborated and more heterogeneous, and have
eventually added to them a new element facilitating the nutritive processes. The channels of
communication pass through similar phases of development, which bring them to analogous forms.
And the directions, rhythms, and rates of circulation, progress by like steps to like final
conditions.

We come at length to the nervous system. Having noticed the primary differentiation of societies
into the governing and governed classes, and observed its analogy to the differentiation of
the two primary tissues which respectively develop into organs of external action and organs
of alimentation; having noticed some of the leading analogies between the development of industrial
arrangements and that of the alimentary apparatus; and having, above, more fully traced the
analogies between the distributing systems, social and individual; we have now to compare the
appliances by which a society, as a whole, is regulated, with those by which the movements
of an individual creature are regulated. We shall find here parallelisms equally striking with
those already detailed.

The class out of which governmental organization originates, is, as we have said, analogous
in its relations to the ectoderm of the lowest animals and of embryonic forms. And as this
primitive membrane, out of which the nervo-muscular system is evolved, must, even in the first
stage of its differentiation, be slightly distinguished from the rest by that greater impressibility
and contractility characterizing the organs to which it gives rise; so, in that superior class
which is eventually transformed into the directo-executive system of a society (its legislative
and defensive appliances), does there exist in the beginning, a larger endowment of the capacities
required for these higher social functions. Always, in rude assemblages of men, the strongest,
most courageous, and most sagacious, become rulers and leaders; and, in a tribe of some standing,
this results in the establishment of a dominant class, characterized on the average by those
mental and bodily qualities which fit them for deliberation and vigorous combined action. Thus
that greater impressibility and contractility, which in the rudest animal types characterize
the units of the ectoderm, characterize also the units of the primitive social stratum which
controls and fights; since impressibility and contractility are the respective roots of intelligence
and strength.

Again, in the unmodified ectoderm, as we see it in the Hydra, the units are all endowed both
with impressibility and contractility; but as we ascend to higher types of organization, the
ectoderm differentiates into classes of units which divide those two functions between them:
some, becoming exclusively impressible, cease to be contractile; while some, becoming exclusively
contractile, cease to be impressible. Similarly with societies. In an aboriginal tribe, the
directive and executive functions are diffused in a mingled form throughout the whole governing
class. Each minor chief commands those under him, and, if need be, himself coerces them into
obedience. The council of chiefs itself carries out on the battle-field its own decisions.
The head chief not only makes laws, but administers justice with his own hands. In larger and
more settled communities, however, the directive and executive agencies begin to grow distinct
from each other. As fast as his duties accumulate, the head chief or king confines himself
more and more to directing public affairs, and leaves the execution of his will to others:
he deputes others to enforce submission, to inflict punishments, or to carry out minor acts
of offence and defence; and only on occasions when, perhaps, the safety of the society and
his own supremacy are at stake, does he begin to act as well as direct. As this differentiation
establishes itself, the characteristics of the ruler begin to change. No longer, as in an aboriginal
tribe, the strongest and most daring man, the tendency is for him to become the man of greatest
cunning, foresight, and skill in the management of others; for in societies that have advanced
beyond the first stage, it is chiefly such qualities that insure success in gaining supreme
power, and holding it against internal and external enemies. Thus that member of the governing
class who comes to be the chief directing agent, and so plays the same part that a rudimentary
nervous centre does in an unfolding organism, is usually one endowed with some superiorities
of nervous organization.

In those larger and more complex communities possessing, perhaps, a separate military class,
a priesthood, and dispersed masses of population requiring local control, there grow up subordinate
governing agents; who, as their duties accumulate, severally become more directive and less
executive in their characters. And when, as commonly happens, the king begins to collect round
himself advisers who aid him by communicating information, preparing subjects for his judgment,
and issuing his orders; we may say that the form of organization is comparable to one very
general among inferior types of animals, in which there exists a chief ganglion with a few
dispersed minor ganglia under its control.

The analogies between the evolution of governmental structures in societies, and the evolution
of governmental structures in living bodies, are, however, more strikingly displayed during
the formation of nations by coalescence of tribes--a process already shown to be, in several
respects, parallel to the development of creatures that primarily consist of many like segments.
Among other points of community between the successive rings which make up the body in the
lower Annulosa, is the possession of similar pairs of ganglia. These pairs of ganglia, though
connected by nerves, are very incompletely dependent on any general controlling power. Hence
it results that when the body is cut in two, the hinder part continues to move forward under
the propulsion of its numerous legs; and that when the chain of ganglia has been divided without
severing the body, the hind limbs may be seen trying to propel the body in one direction while
the fore limbs are trying to propel it in another. But in the higher Annulosa, called Articulata,
sundry of the anterior pairs of ganglia, besides growing larger, unite in one mass; and this
great cephalic ganglion having become the co-ordinator of all the creature's movements, there
no longer exists much local independence. Now may we not in the growth of a consolidated kingdom
out of petty sovereignties or baronies, observe analogous changes? Like the chiefs and primitive
rulers above described, feudal lords, exercising supreme power over their respective groups
of retainers, discharge functions analogous to those of rudimentary nervous centres. Among
these local governing centres there is, in early feudal times, very little subordination. They
are in frequent antagonism; they are individually restrained chiefly by the influence of parties
in their own class; and they are but irregularly subject to that most powerful member of their
order who has gained the position of head-suzerain or king. As the growth and organization
of the society progresses, these local directive centres fall more and more under the control
of a chief directive centre. Closer commercial union between the several segments is accompanied
by closer governmental union; and these minor rulers end in being little more than agents who
administer, in their several localities, the laws made by the supreme ruler: just as the local
ganglia above described, eventually become agents which enforce, in their respective segments,
the orders of the cephalic ganglion. The parallelism holds still further. We remarked above,
when speaking of the rise of aboriginal kings, that in proportion as their territories increase,
they are obliged not only to perform their executive functions by deputy, but also to gather
round themselves advisers to aid in their directive functions; and that thus, in place of a
solitary governing unit, there grows up a group of governing units, comparable to a ganglion
consisting of many cells. Let us here add that the advisers and chief officers who thus form
the rudiment of a ministry, tend from the beginning to exercise some control over the ruler.
By the information they give and the opinions they express, they sway his judgment and affect
his commands. To this extent he is made a channel through which are communicated the directions
originating with them; and in course of time, when the advice of ministers becomes the acknowledged
source of his actions, the king assumes the character of an automatic centre, reflecting the
impressions made on him from without.

Beyond this complication of governmental structure many societies do not progress; but in some,
a further development takes place. Our own case best illustrates this further development and
its further analogies. To kings and their ministries have been added, in England, other great
directive centres, exercising a control which, at first small, has been gradually becoming
predominant: as with the great governing ganglia which especially distinguish the highest classes
of living beings. As it is in the nature of a single ganglion to be affected only by special
stimuli from particular parts of the body; so it is in the nature of a single ruler to be swayed
in his acts by exclusive personal or class interests. As it is in the nature of a cluster of
ganglia, connected with the primary one, to convey to it a greater variety of influences from
more numerous organs, and thus to make its acts conform to more numerous requirements; so it
is in the nature of the subsidiary controlling powers surrounding a king to adapt his rule
to a greater number of public exigencies. And as it is in the nature of those great and latest-developed
ganglia which distinguish the higher animals, to interpret and combine the multiplied and varied
impressions conveyed to them from all parts of the system, and to regulate the actions in such
way as duly to regard them all; so it is in the nature of those great and latest-developed
legislative bodies which distinguish the most advanced societies, to interpret and combine
the wishes of all classes and localities, and to make laws in harmony with the general wants.
Besides being comparable in their duties, these great directive centres, social and individual,
are comparable in the processes by which their duties are discharged. The cerebrum is not occupied
with direct impressions from without but with the ideas of such impressions. Instead of the
actual sensations produced in the body, and directly appreciated by the sensory ganglia, or
primitive nervous centres, the cerebrum receives only the representations of these sensations;
and its consciousness is called representative consciousness, to distinguish it from the original
or presentative consciousness. Is it not significant that we have hit on the same word to distinguish
the function of our House of Commons? We call it a representative body, because the interests
with which it deals are not directly presented to it, but represented to it by its various
members; and a debate is a conflict of representations of the results likely to follow from
a proposed course--a description which applies with equal truth to a debate in the individual
consciousness. In both cases, too, these great governing masses take no part in the executive
functions. As, after a conflict in the cerebrum, those desires which finally predominate act
on the subjacent ganglia, and through their instrumentality determine the bodily actions; so
the parties which, after a parliamentary struggle, gain the victory, do not themselves carry
out their wishes, but get them carried out by the executive divisions of the Government. The
fulfilment of all legislative decisions still devolves on the original directive centres: the
impulse passing from the Parliament to the Ministers and from the Ministers to the King, in
whose name everything is done; just as those smaller, first-developed ganglia, which in the
lowest vertebrata are the chief controlling agents, are still, in the brains of the higher
vertebrata, the agents through which the dictates of the cerebrum are worked out. Moreover,
in both cases these original centres become increasingly automatic. In the developed vertebrate
animal, they have little function beyond that of conveying impressions to, and executing the
determinations of, the larger centres. In our highly organized government, the monarch has
long been lapsing into a passive agent of Parliament; and now, ministries are rapidly falling
into the same position. Nay, between the two cases there is a parallelism even in respect of
the exceptions to this automatic action. For in the individual creature it happens that under
circumstances of sudden alarm, as from a loud sound close at hand, an unexpected object starting
up in front, or a slip from insecure footing, the danger is guarded against by some quick involuntary
jump, or adjustment of the limbs, which occurs before there is time to consider the impending
evil and take deliberate measures to avoid it: the rationale of which is that these violent
impressions produced on the senses, are reflected from the sensory ganglia to the spinal cord
and muscles, without, as in ordinary cases, first passing through the cerebrum. In like manner
on national emergencies calling for prompt action, the King and Ministry, not having time to
lay the matter before the great deliberative bodies, themselves issue commands for the requisite
movements or precautions: the primitive, and now almost automatic, directive centres, resume
for a moment their original uncontrolled power. And then, strangest of all, observe that in
either case there is an after-process of approval or disapproval. The individual on recovering
from his automatic start, at once contemplates the cause of his fright; and, according to the
case, concludes that it was well he moved as he did, or condemns himself for his groundless
alarm. In like manner, the deliberative powers of the State discuss, as soon as may be, the
unauthorized acts of the executive powers; and, deciding that the reasons were or were not
sufficient, grant or withhold a bill of indemnity.[28]

Thus far in comparing the governmental organization of the body-politic with that of an individual
body, we have considered only the respective co-ordinating centres. We have yet to consider
the channels through which these co-ordinating centres receive information and convey commands.
In the simplest societies, as in the simplest organisms, there is no "internuncial apparatus,"
as Hunter styled the nervous system. Consequently, impressions can be but slowly propagated
from unit to unit throughout the whole mass. The same progress, however, which, in animal-organization,
shows itself in the establishment of ganglia or directive centres, shows itself also in the
establishment of nerve-threads, through which the ganglia receive and convey impressions and
so control remote organs. And in societies the like eventually takes place. After a long period
during which the directive centres communicate with various parts of the society through other
means, there at last comes into existence an "internuncial apparatus," analogous to that found
in individual bodies. The comparison of telegraph-wires to nerves is familiar to all. It applies,
however, to an extent not commonly supposed. Thus, throughout the vertebrate sub-kingdom, the
great nerve-bundles diverge from the vertebrate axis side by side with the great arteries;
and similarly, our groups of telegraph-wires are carried along the sides of our railways. The
most striking parallelism, however, remains. Into each great bundle of nerves, as it leaves
the axis of the body along with an artery, there enters a branch of the sympathetic nerve;
which branch, accompanying the artery throughout its ramifications, has the function of regulating
its diameter and otherwise controlling the flow of blood through it according to local requirements.
Analogously, in the group of telegraph-wires running alongside each railway, there is a wire
for the purpose of regulating the traffic--for retarding or expediting the flow of passengers
and commodities, as the local conditions demand. Probably, when our now rudimentary telegraph-system
is fully developed, other analogies will be traceable.

Such, then, is a general outline of the evidence which justifies the comparison of societies
to living organisms. And on carrying out the comparison in detail, we find that these major
analogies involve many minor analogies, far closer than might have been expected. Others might
be added. We had hoped to say something respecting the different types of social organization,
and something also on social metamorphoses; but we have reached our assigned limits.

FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote 28: It may be well to warn the reader against an error fallen into by one who criticised
this essay on its first publication--the error of supposing that the analogy here intended
to be drawn, is a specific analogy between the organization of society in England, and the
human organization. As said at the outset, no such specific analogy exists. The above parallel
is one between the most-developed systems of governmental organization, individual and social;
and the vertebrate type is instanced merely as exhibiting this most-developed system. If any
specific comparison were made, which it cannot rationally be, it would be made with some much
lower vertebrate form than the human.]

THE ORIGIN OF ANIMAL WORSHIP.

    [First published in The Fortnightly Review for May, 1870.]

Mr. McLennan's recent essays on the Worship of Animals and Plants have done much to elucidate
a very obscure subject. By pursuing in this case, as before in another case, the truly scientific
method of comparing the phenomena presented by existing uncivilized races with those which
the traditions of civilized races present, he has rendered both of them more comprehensible
than they were before.

It seems to me, however, that Mr. McLennan gives but an indefinite answer to the essential
question--How did the worship of animals and plants arise? Indeed, in his concluding paper,
he expressly leaves this problem unsolved; saying that his "is not an hypothesis explanatory
of the origin of Totemism, be it remembered, but an hypothesis explanatory of the animal and
plant worship of the ancient nations." So that we have still to ask--Why have savage tribes
so generally taken animals and plants and other things as totems? What can have induced this
tribe to ascribe special sacredness to one creature, and that tribe to another? And if to these
questions the reply is, that each tribe considers itself to be descended from the object of
its reverence, then there presses for answer the further question--How came so strange a notion
into existence? If this notion occurred in one case only, we might set it down to some whim
of thought or some illusive occurrence. But appealing, as it does, with multitudinous variations
among so many uncivilized races in different parts of the world, and having left numerous marks
in the superstitions of extinct civilized races, we cannot assume any special or exceptional
cause. Moreover, the general cause, whatever it may be, must be such as does not negative an
aboriginal intelligence like in nature to our own. After studying the grotesque beliefs of
savages, we are apt to suppose that their reason is not as our reason. But this supposition
is inadmissible. Given the amount of knowledge which primitive men possess, and given the imperfect
verbal symbols used by them in speech and thought, and the conclusions they habitually reach
will be those that are relatively the most rational. This must be our postulate; and, setting
out with this postulate, we have to ask how primitive men came so generally, if not universally,
to believe themselves the progeny of animals or plants or inanimate bodies. There is, I believe,
a satisfactory answer.

       *       *       *       *       *

The proposition with which Mr. McLennan sets out, that totem-worship preceded the worship of
anthropomorphic gods, is one to which I can yield but a qualified assent. It is true in a sense,
but not wholly true. If the words "gods" and "worship" carry with them their ordinary definite
meanings, the statement is true; but if their meanings are widened so as to comprehend those
earliest vague notions out of which the definite ideas of gods and worship are evolved, I think
it is not true. The rudimentary form of all religion is the propitiation of dead ancestors,
who are supposed to be still existing, and to be capable of working good or evil to their descendants.
As a preparation for dealing hereafter with the principles of sociology, I have, for some years
past, directed much attention to the modes of thought current in the simpler human societies;
and evidence of many kinds, furnished by all varieties of uncivilized men, has forced on me
a conclusion harmonizing with that lately expressed in this Review by Prof. Huxley--namely,
that the savage, conceiving a corpse to be deserted by the active personality who dwelt in
it, conceives this active personality to be still existing, and that his feelings and ideas
concerning it form the basis of his superstitions. Everywhere we find expressed Or implied
the belief that each person is double; and that when he dies, his other self, whether remaining
near at hand or gone far away, may return, and continues capable of injuring his enemies and
aiding his friends.[29]

But how out of the desire to propitiate this second personality of a deceased man (the words
"ghost" and "spirit" are somewhat misleading, since the savage believes that the second personality
reappears in a form equally tangible with the first), does there grow up the worship of animals,
plants, and inanimate objects? Very simply. Savages habitually distinguish individuals by names
that are either directly suggestive of some personal trait or fact of personal history, or
else express an observed community of character with some well-known object. Such a genesis
of individual names, before surnames have arisen, is inevitable; and how easily it arises we
shall see on remembering that it still goes on in its original form, even when no longer needful.
I do not refer only to the significant fact that in some parts of England, as in the nail-making
districts, nicknames are general, and surnames little recognized; but I refer to a common usage
among both children and adults. The rude man is apt to be known as "a bear;" a sly fellow,
as "an old fox;" a hypocrite, as "the crocodile." Names of plants, too, are used; as when the
red-haired boy is called "carrots" by his school-fellows. Nor do we lack nicknames derived
from inorganic objects and agents: instance that given by Mr. Carlyle to the elder Sterling--"Captain
Whirlwind." Now, in the earliest savage state, this metaphorical naming will in most cases
commence afresh in each generation--must do so, indeed, until surnames of some kind have been
established. I say in most cases, because there will occur exceptions in the cases of men who
have distinguished themselves. If "the Wolf," proving famous in fight, becomes a terror to
neighbouring tribes, and a dominant man in his own, his sons, proud of their parentage, will
not let fall the fact that they descended from "the Wolf"; nor will this fact be forgotten
by the rest of the tribe who hold "the Wolf" in awe, and see reason to dread his sons. In proportion
to the power and celebrity of "the Wolf" will this pride and this fear conspire to maintain
among his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as among those over whom they dominate,
the remembrance of the fact that their ancestor was "the Wolf". And if, as will occasionally
happen, this dominant family becomes the root of a new tribe, the members of this tribe will
become known to themselves and others as "the Wolves".

We need not rest satisfied with the inference that this inheritance of nicknames will take
place. There is proof that it does take place. As nicknaming after animals, plants, and other
objects, still goes on among ourselves, so among ourselves does there go on the descent of
nicknames. An instance has come under my own notice on an estate in the West Highlands, belonging
to some friends with whom I frequently have the pleasure of spending a few weeks in the autumn.
"Take a young Croshek," has more than once been the reply of my host to the inquiry, who should
go with me, when I was setting out salmon-fishing. The elder Croshek I knew well; and supposed
that this name, borne by him and by all belonging to him, was the family surname. Years passed
before I learned that the real surname was Cameron; that the father was called Croshek, after
the name of his cottage, to distinguish him from other Camerons employed about the premises;
and that his children had come to be similarly distinguished. Though here, as very generally
in Scotland, the nickname was derived from the place of residence, yet had it been derived
from an animal, the process would have been the same: inheritance of it would have occurred
just as naturally. Not even for this small link in the argument, however, need we depend on
inference. There is fact to bear us out. Mr. Bates, in his Naturalist on the River Amazons
(2d ed., p. 376), describing three half-castes who accompanied him on a hunting trip, says--"Two
of them were brothers, namely, João (John) and Zephyrino Jabutí: Jabutí, or tortoise, being
a nickname which their father had earned for his slow gait, and which, as is usual in this
country, had descended as the surname of the family." Let me add the statement made by Mr.
Wallace respecting this same region, that "one of the tribes on the river Isánna is called
'Jurupari' (Devils). Another is called 'Ducks;' a third, 'Stars;' a fourth, 'Mandiocca.'" Putting
these two statements together, can there be any doubt about the genesis of these tribal names?
Let "the Tortoise" become sufficiently distinguished (not necessarily by superiority--great
inferiority may occasionally suffice) and the tradition of descent from him, preserved by his
descendants themselves if he was superior, and by their contemptuous neighbours if he was inferior,
may become a tribal name.[30]

"But this," it will be said, "does not amount to an explanation of animal-worship." True: a
third factor remains to be specified. Given a belief in the still-existing other self of the
deceased ancestor, who must be propitiated; given this survival of his metaphorical name among
his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.; and the further requisite is that the distinction
between metaphor and reality shall be forgotten. Let tradition fail to keep clearly in view
the fact that the ancestor was a man called "the Wolf"--let him be habitually spoken of as
"the Wolf", just as when alive; and the natural mistake of taking the name literally will bring
with it, firstly, a belief in descent from an actual wolf, and, secondly, a treatment of the
wolf in a manner likely to propitiate him--a manner appropriate to one who may be the other
self of the dead ancestor, or one of the kindred, and therefore a friend.

That a misunderstanding of this kind is likely to grow up, becomes obvious when we bear in
mind the great indefiniteness of primitive language. As Prof. Max Müller says, respecting certain
misinterpretations of an opposite kind: "These metaphors ... would become mere names handed
down in the conversation of a family, understood perhaps by the grandfather, familiar to the
father, but strange to the son, and misunderstood by the grandson." We have ample reason, then,
for supposing such misinterpretations. Nay, we may go further. We are justified in saying that
they are certain to occur. For undeveloped languages contain no words capable of indicating
the distinction to be kept in view. In the tongues of existing inferior races, only concrete
objects and acts are expressible. The Australians have a name for each kind of tree, but no
name for tree irrespective of kind. And though some witnesses allege that their vocabulary
is not absolutely destitute of generic names, its extreme poverty in such is unquestionable.
Similarly with the Tasmanians. Dr. Milligan says they "had acquired very limited powers of
abstraction or generalization. They possessed no words representing abstract ideas; for each
variety of gum-tree and wattle-tree, etc., etc., they had a name, but they had no equivalent
for the expression, 'a tree;' neither could they express abstract qualities, such as hard,
soft, warm, cold, long, short, round, etc.; for 'hard,' they would say 'like a stone;' for
'tall,' they would say 'long legs,' etc.; and for 'round,' they said 'like a ball,' 'like the
moon,' and so on, usually suiting the action to the word, and confirming, by some sign, the
meaning to be understood."[31] Now, even making allowance for over-statement here (which seems
needful, since the word "long," said to be inexpressible in the abstract, subsequently occurs
as qualifying a concrete in the expression, "long legs"), it is manifest that so imperfect
a language must fail to convey the idea of a name, as something separate from a thing; and
that still less can it be capable of indicating the act of naming. Familiar use of such partially-abstract
words as are applicable to all objects of a class, is needful before there can be reached the
conception of a name--a word symbolizing the symbolic character of other words; and the conception
of a name, with its answering abstract term, must be long current before the verb to name can
arise. Hence, men with speech so rude, cannot transmit the tradition of an ancestor named "the
Wolf", as distinguished from the actual wolf. The children and grandchildren who saw him will
not be led into error; but in later generations, descent from "the Wolf" will inevitably come
to mean descent from the animal known by that name. And the ideas and sentiments which, as
above shown, naturally grow up round the belief that the dead parents and grandparents are
still alive, and ready, if propitiated, to befriend their descendants, will be extended to
the wolf species.

Before passing to other developments of this general view, let me point out how not simply
animal-worship is thus accounted for, but also the conception, so variously illustrated in
ancient legends, that animals are capable of displaying human powers of speech and thought
and action. Industrially function it is a counties having all same other covalence is noted up

 But should not a true theory of these first steps in the evolution
of thought and language show us how it happened that men acquired the seemingly-strange habit
of so framing their words for sky, earth, dew, rain, etc., as to make them indicative of sex?
Or, at any rate, must it not be admitted that an interpretation which, instead of assuming
this habit to be "necessary," shows us how it results, thereby acquires an additional claim
to acceptance? The interpretation I have indicated does this. If men and women are habitually
nicknamed, and if defects of language lead their descendants to regard themselves as descendants
of the things from which the names were taken, then masculine or feminine genders will be ascribed
to these things according as the ancestors named after them were men or women. If a beautiful
maiden known metaphorically as "the Dawn," afterwards becomes the mother of some distinguished
chief called "the North Wind," it will result that when, in course of time, the two have been
mistaken for the actual dawn and the actual north wind, these will, by implication, be respectively
considered as male and female.

Looking, now, at the ancient myths in general, their seemingly most inexplicable trait is the
habitual combination of alleged human ancestry and adventures, with the possession of personalities
otherwise figuring in the heavens and on the earth, with totally non-human attributes. This
enormous incongruity, not the exception but the rule, the current theory fails to explain.
Suppose it to be granted that the great terrestrial and celestial objects and agents naturally
become personalized; it does not follow that each of them shall have a specific human biography.
To say of some star that he was the son of this king or that hero, was born in a particular
place, and when grown up carried off the wife of a neighbouring chief, is a gratuitous multiplication
of incongruities already sufficiently great; and is not accounted for by the alleged necessary
personalization of abstract and collective nouns. As looked at from our present stand-point,
however, such traditions become quite natural--nay, it is clear that they will necessarily
arise. When a nickname has become a tribal name, it thereby ceases to be individually distinctive;
and, as already said, the process of nicknaming inevitably continues. It commences afresh with
each child; and the nickname of each child is both an individual name and a potential tribal
name, which may become an actual tribal name if the individual is sufficiently celebrated.
Usually, then, there is a double set of distinctions; under one of which the individual is
known by his ancestral name, and under the other of which he is known by a name suggestive
of something peculiar to himself: just as we have seen happens among the Scotch clans. Consider,
now, what will result when language has reached a stage of development such that it can convey
the notion of naming, and is able, therefore, to preserve traditions of human ancestry. It
will result that the individual will be known both as the son of such and such a man by a mother
whose name was so and so, and also as "the Crab", or "the Bear", or "the Whirlwind"--supposing
one of these to be his nickname. Such joint use of nicknames and proper names occurs in every
school. Now, clearly, in advancing from the early state in which ancestors become identified
with the objects they are nicknamed after, to the state in which there are proper names that
have lost their metaphorical meanings, there must be passed through a state in which proper
names, partially settled only, may or may not be preserved, and in which the new nicknames
are still liable to be mistaken for actual names. Under such conditions there will arise (especially
in the case of a distinguished man) this seemingly-impossible combination of human parentage
with the possession of the non-human, or superhuman, attributes of the thing which gave the
nickname. Another anomaly simultaneously disappears. The warrior may have, and often will have,
a variety of complimentary nicknames--"the powerful one," "the destroyer," etc. Supposing his
leading nickname has been "the Sun"; then when he comes to be identified by tradition with
the sun, it will happen that the sun will acquire his alternative descriptive titles--the swift
one, the lion, the wolf--titles not obviously appropriate to the sun, but quite appropriate
to the warrior. Then there comes, too, an explanation of the remaining trait of such myths.
When this identification of conspicuous persons, male and female, with conspicuous natural
agents, has become settled, there will in due course arise interpretations of the actions of
these agents in anthropomorphic terms. Suppose, for instance, that Endymion and Selene, metaphorically
named, the one after the setting sun, the other after the moon, have had their human individualities
merged in those of the sun and moon, through misinterpretation of metaphors; what will happen?
The legend of their loves having to be reconciled with their celestial appearances and motions,
these will be spoken of as results of feeling and will; so that when the sun is going down
in the west, while the moon in mid-heaven is following him, the fact will be expressed by saying:
"Selene loves and watches Endymion." Thus we obtain a consistent explanation of the myth without
distorting it; and without assuming that it contains gratuitous fictions. We are enabled to
accept the biographical part of it, if not as literal fact, still as having had fact for its
root. We are helped to see how, by an inevitable misinterpretation, there grew out of a more
or less true tradition, this strange identification of its personages, with objects and powers
totally non-human in their aspects. And then we are shown how, from the attempt to reconcile
in thought these contradictory elements of the myth, there arose the habit of ascribing the
actions of these non-human things to human motives.

One further verification may be drawn from facts which are obstacles to the converse hypothesis.
These objects and powers, celestial and terrestrial, which force themselves most on men's attention,
have some of them several proper names, identified with those of different individuals, born
at different places, and having different sets of adventures. Thus we have the sun variously
known as Apollo, Endymion, Helios, Tithonos, etc.--personages having irreconcilable genealogies.
Such anomalies Prof. Max Müller apparently ascribes to the untrustworthiness of traditions,
which are "careless about contradictions, or ready to solve them sometimes by the most atrocious
expedients." (Chips, vol. ii., p. 84.) But if the evolution of the myth has been that above
indicated, there exists no anomalies to be got rid of: these diverse genealogies become parts
of the evidence. For we have abundant proof that the same objects furnish metaphorical names
of men in different tribes. There are Duck tribes in Australia, in South America, in North
America. The eagle is still a totem among the North Americans, as Mr. McLennan shows reason
to conclude that it was among the Egyptians, among the Jews, and among the Romans. Obviously,
for reasons already assigned, it naturally happened in the early stages of the ancient races,
that complimentary comparisons of their heroes to the Sun were frequently made. What resulted?
The Sun having furnished names for sundry chiefs and early founders of tribes, and local traditions
having severally identified them with the Sun, these tribes, when they grew, spread, conquered,
or came otherwise into partial union, originated a combined mythology, which necessarily contained
conflicting stories about the Sun-god, as about its other leading personages. If the North-American
tribes, among several of which there are traditions of a Sun-god, had developed a combined
civilization, there would similarly have arisen among them a mythology which ascribed to the
Sun several different proper names and genealogies.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let me briefly set down the leading characters of this hypothesis which give it probability.

True interpretations of all the natural processes, organic and inorganic, that have gone on
in past times, habitually trace them to causes still in action. It is thus in Geology; it is
thus in Biology; it is thus in Philology. Here we find this characteristic repeated. Nicknaming,
the inheritance of nicknames, and to some extent, the misinterpretation of nicknames, go on
among us still; and were surnames absent, language imperfect, and knowledge as rudimentary
as of old, it is tolerably manifest that results would arise like those we have contemplated.

A further characteristic of a true cause is that it accounts not only for the particular group
of phenomena to be interpreted, but also for other groups. The cause here alleged does this.
It equally well explains the worship of animals, of plants, of mountains, of winds, of celestial
bodies, and even of appearances too vague to be considered entities. It gives us an intelligible
genesis of fetichistic conceptions in general. It furnishes us with a reason for the practice,
otherwise so unaccountable, of moulding the words applied to inanimate objects in such ways
as to imply masculine and feminine genders. It shows us how there naturally arose the worship
of compound animals, and of monsters half man, half brute. And it shows us why the worship
of purely anthropomorphic deities came later, when language had so far developed that it could
preserve in tradition the distinction between proper names and nicknames.

A further verification of this view is, that it conforms to the general law of evolution: showing
us how, out of one simple, vague, aboriginal form of belief, there have arisen, by continuous
differentiations, the many heterogeneous forms of belief which have existed and do exist. The
desire to propitiate the other self of the dead ancestor, displayed among savage tribes, dominantly
manifested by the early historic races, by the Peruvians and Mexicans, by the Chinese at the
present time, and to a considerable degree by ourselves (for what else is the wish to do that
which a lately-deceased parent was known to have desired?) has been the universal first form
of religious belief; and from it have grown up the many divergent beliefs which have been referred
to.

Let me add, as a further reason for adopting this view, that it immensely diminishes the apparently-great
contrast between early modes of thought and our own mode of thought. Doubtless the aboriginal
man differs considerably from us, both in intellect and feeling. But such an interpretation
of the facts as helps us to bridge over the gap, derives additional likelihood from doing this.
The hypothesis I have sketched out enables us to see that primitive ideas are not so gratuitously
absurd as we suppose, and also enables us to rehabilitate the ancient myth with far less distortion
than at first sight appears possible.

These views I hope to develop in the first part of The Principles of Sociology. The large mass
of evidence which I shall be able to give in support of the hypothesis, joined with the solutions
it will be shown to yield of many minor problems which I have passed over, will, I think, then
give to it a still greater probability than it seems now to have.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 29: A critical reader may raise an objection. If animal-worship is to be rationally
interpreted, how can the interpretation set out by assuming a belief in the spirits of dead
ancestors--a belief which just as much requires explanation? Doubtless there is here a wide
gap in the argument. I hope eventually to fill it up. Here, out of many experiences which conspire
to generate this belief, I can but briefly indicate the leading ones: 1. It is not impossible
that his shadow, following him everywhere, and moving as he moves, may have some small share
in giving to the savage a vague idea of his duality. It needs but to watch a child's interest
in the movements of its shadow, and to remember that at first a shadow cannot be interpreted
as a negation of light, but is looked upon as an entity, to perceive that the savage may very
possibly consider it as a specific something which forms part of him. 2. A much more decided
suggestion of the same kind is likely to result from the reflection of his face and figure
in water: imitating him as it does in his form, colours, motions, grimaces. When we remember
that not unfrequently a savage objects to have his portrait taken, because he thinks whoever
carries away a representation of him carries away some part of his being, we see how probable
it is that he thinks his double in the water is a reality in some way belonging to him. 3.
Echoes must greatly tend to confirm the idea of duality otherwise arrived at. Incapable as
he is of understanding their natural origin, the primitive man necessarily ascribes them to
living beings--beings who mock him and elude his search. 4. The suggestions resulting from
these and other physical phenomena are, however, secondary in importance. The root of this
belief in another self lies in the experience of dreams. The distinction so easily made by
us between our life in dreams and our real life, is one which the savage recognizes in but
a vague way; and he cannot express even that distinction which he perceives. When he awakes,
and to those who have seen him lying quietly asleep, describes where he has been, and what
he has done, his rude language fails to state the difference between seeing and dreaming that
he saw, doing and dreaming that he did. From this inadequacy of his language it not only results
that he cannot truly represent this difference to others, but also that he cannot truly represent
it to himself. Hence, in the absence of an alternative interpretation, his belief, and that
of those to whom he tells his adventures, is that his other self has been away, and came back
when he awoke. And this belief, which we find among various existing savage tribes, we equally
find in the traditions of the early civilized races. 5. The conception of another self capable
of going away and returning, receives what to the savage must seem conclusive verifications
from the abnormal suspensions of consciousness, and derangements of consciousness, that occasionally
occur in members of his tribe. One who has fainted, and cannot be immediately brought back
to himself (note the significance of our own phrases "returning to himself," etc.) as a sleeper
can, shows him a state in which the other self has been away for a time beyond recall. Still
more is this prolonged absence of the other self shown him in cases of apoplexy, catalepsy,
and other forms of suspended animation. Here for hours the other self persists in remaining
away, and on returning refuses to say where he has been. Further verification is afforded by
every epileptic subject, into whose body, during the absence of the other self, some enemy
has entered; for how else does it happen that the other self, on returning, denies all knowledge
of what his body has been doing? And this supposition that the body has been "possessed" by
some other being, is confirmed by the phenomena of somnambulism and insanity. 6. What, then,
is the interpretation inevitably put upon death? The other self has habitually returned after
sleep, which simulates death. It has returned, too, after fainting, which simulates death much
more. It has even returned after the rigid state of catalepsy, which simulates death very greatly.
Will it not return also after this still more prolonged quiescence and rigidity? Clearly it
is quite possible--quite probable even. The dead man's other self is gone away for a long time,
but it still exists somewhere, far or near, and may at any moment come back to do all he said
he would do. Hence the various burial-rites--the placing of weapons and valuables along with
the body, the daily bringing of food to it, etc. I hope hereafter to show that, with such knowledge
of the facts as he has, this interpretation is the most reasonable the savage can arrive at.
Let me here, however, by way of showing how clearly the facts bear out this view, give one
illustration out of many. "The ceremonies with which they [the Veddahs] invoke them [the shades
of the dead] are few as they are simple. The most common is the following. An arrow is fixed
upright in the ground, and the Veddah dances slowly round it, chanting this invocation, which
is almost musical in its rhythm:"

     "Mâ miya, mâ miy, mâ deyâ,
     Topang koyihetti mittigan yandâh?"

   "My departed one, my departed one, my God!
   Where art thou wandering?"

"This invocation appears to be used on all occasions when the intervention of the guardian
spirits is required, in sickness, preparatory to hunting, etc. Sometimes, in the latter case,
a portion of the flesh of the game is promised as a votive offering, in the event of the chase
being successful; and they believe that the spirits will appear to them in dreams and tell
them where to hunt. Sometimes they cook food and place it in the dry bed of a river, or some
other secluded spot, and then call on their deceased ancestors by name. 'Come and partake of
this! Give us maintenance as you did when living! Come, wheresoever you may be; on a tree,
on a rock, in the forest, come!' And they dance round the food, half chanting, half shouting,
the invocation."--Bailey, in Transactions of the Ethnological Society, London, N. S., ii.,
p. 301-2.]

[Footnote 30: Since the foregoing pages were written, my attention has been drawn by Sir John
Lubbock to a passage in the appendix to the second edition of Prehistoric Times, in which he
has indicated this derivation of tribal names. He says: "In endeavouring to account for the
worship of animals, we must remember that names are very frequently taken from them. The children
and followers of a man called the Bear or the Lion would make that a tribal name. Hence the
animal itself would be first respected, at last worshipped." Of the genesis of this worship,
however, Sir John Lubbock does not give any specific explanation. Apparently he inclines to
the belief, tacitly adopted also by Mr. McLennan, that animal-worship is derived from an original
Fetichism, of which it is a more developed form. As will shortly be seen, I take a different
view of its origin.]

[Footnote 31: Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania, iii., p. 280-81.]

[Footnote 32: I have since found, however, that the name Dawn, which occurs in various places,
seems more frequently a birth-name, given because the birth took place at dawn.]

MORALS AND MORAL SENTIMENTS.

    [First published in The Fortnightly Review for April, 1871.]

If a writer who discusses unsettled questions takes up every gauntlet thrown down to him, polemical
writing will absorb much of his energy. Having a power of work which unfortunately does not
suffice for executing with anything like due rapidity the task I have undertaken, I have made
it a policy to avoid controversy as much as possible, even at the cost of being seriously misunderstood.
Hence it resulted that when in Macmillan's Magazine, for July, 1869, Mr. Richard Hutton published,
under the title "A Questionable Parentage for Morals," a criticism on a doctrine of mine, I
decided to let his misrepresentations pass unnoticed until, in the course of my work, I arrived
at the stage where, by a full exposition of this doctrine, they would be set aside. It did
not occur to me that, in the meantime, these erroneous statements, accepted as true statements,
would be repeated by other writers, and my views commented upon as untenable. This, however,
has happened. In more periodicals than one, I have seen it asserted that Mr. Hutton has effectually
disposed of my hypothesis. Supposing that this hypothesis has been rightly expressed by Mr.
Hutton, Sir John Lubbock, in his Origin of Civilisation, &c., has been led to express a partial
dissent; which I think he would not have expressed had my own exposition been before him. Mr.
Mivart, too, in his recent Genesis of Species, has been similarly betrayed into misapprehensions.
And now Sir Alexander Grant, following the same lead, has conveyed to the readers of the Fortnightly
Review another of these conceptions, which is but very partially true. Thus I find myself compelled
to say as much as will serve to prevent further spread of the mischief.

       *       *       *       *       *

If a general doctrine concerning a highly-involved class of phenomena could be adequately presented
in a single paragraph of a letter, the writing of books would be superfluous. In the brief
exposition of certain ethical doctrines held by me, which is given in Professor Bain's Mental
and Moral Science, it is stated that they are--

     "as yet, nowhere fully expressed. They form part of the more
     general doctrine of Evolution which he is engaged in working out;
     and they are at present to be gathered only from scattered
     passages. It is true that, in his first work, Social Statics, he
     presented what he then regarded as a tolerably complete view of one
     division of Morals. But without abandoning this view, he now
     regards it as inadequate--more especially in respect of its basis."

Mr. Hutton, however, taking the bare enunciation of one part of this basis, deals with it critically;
and, in the absence of any exposition by me, sets forth what he supposes to be my grounds for
it, and proceeds to show that they are unsatisfactory.

If, in his anxiety to suppress what he doubtless regards as a pernicious doctrine, Mr. Hutton
could not wait until I had explained myself, it might have been expected that he would use
whatever information was to be had concerning it. So far from seeking out such information,
however, he has, in a way for which I cannot account, ignored the information immediately before
him.

The title which Mr. Hutton has chosen for his criticism is, "A Questionable Parentage for Morals."
Now he has ample means of knowing that I allege a primary basis of Morals, quite independent
of that which he describes and rejects. I do not refer merely to the fact that having, when
he reviewed Social Statics,[33] expressed his very decided dissent from this primary basis,
he must have been aware that I alleged it; for he may say that in the many years which have
since elapsed he had forgotten all about it. But I refer to the distinct enunciation of this
primary basis in that letter to Mr. Mill from which he quotes. In a preceding paragraph of
the letter, I have explained that, while I accept utilitarianism in the abstract, I do not
accept that current utilitarianism which recognizes for the guidance of conduct nothing beyond
empirical generalizations; and I have contended that--

     "Morality, properly so-called--the science of right conduct--has
     for its object to determine how and why certain modes of
     conduct are detrimental, and certain other modes beneficial. These
     good and bad results cannot be accidental, but must be necessary
     consequences of the constitution of things; and I conceive it to be
     the business of Moral Science to deduce, from the laws of life and
     the conditions of existence, what kinds of action necessarily tend
     to produce happiness, and what kinds to produce unhappiness. Having
     done this, its deductions are to be recognised as laws of conduct;
     and are to be conformed to irrespective of a direct estimation of
     happiness or misery."

Nor is this the only enunciation of what I conceive to be the primary basis of morals, contained
in this same letter. A subsequent paragraph separated by four lines only from that which Mr.
Hutton extracts, commences thus:--

    "Progressing civilization, which is of necessity a succession of
    compromises between old and new, requires a perpetual re-adjustment
    of the compromise between the ideal and the practicable in social
    arrangements: to which end, both elements of the compromise must be
    kept in view. If it is true that pure rectitude prescribes a system
    of things far too good for men as they are, it is not less true that
    mere expediency does not of itself tend to establish a system of
    things any better than that which exists. While absolute morality
    owes to expediency the checks which prevent it from rushing into
    Utopian absurdities, expediency is indebted to absolute morality for
    all stimulus to improvement. Granted that we are chiefly interested
    in ascertaining what is relatively right, it still follows that we
     must first consider what is absolutely right; since the one
    conception presupposes the other."

I do not see how there could well be a more emphatic assertion that there exists a primary
basis of morals independent of, and in a sense antecedent to, that which is furnished by experiences
of utility; and consequently, independent of, and, in a sense antecedent to, those moral sentiments
which I conceive to be generated by such experiences. Yet no one could gather from Mr. Hutton's
article that I assert this; or would even find reasons for a faint suspicion that I do so.
From the reference made to my further views, he would infer my acceptance of that empirical
utilitarianism which I have expressly repudiated. And the title which Mr. Hutton gives to his
paper clearly asserts, by implication, that I recognize no "parentage for morals" beyond that
of the accumulation and organization of the effects of experience. I cannot believe that Mr.
Hutton intended to convey this erroneous impression. He was, I suppose, too much absorbed in
contemplating the proposition he combats to observe, or, at least, to attach any weight to,
the propositions which accompany it. But I am sorry he did not perceive the mischief he was
likely to do me by spreading this one-sided statement.

       *       *       *       *       *

I pass now to the particular question at issue--not the "parentage for morals," but the parentage
of moral sentiments. In describing my view on this more special doctrine, Mr. Hutton has similarly,
I regret to say, neglected the data which would have helped him to draw an approximately true
outline of it. It cannot well be that the existence of such data was unknown to him. They are
contained in the Principles of Psychology; and Mr. Hutton reviewed that work when it was first
published.[34] In a chapter on the Feelings, which occurs near the end of it, there is sketched
out a process of evolution by no means like that which Mr. Hutton indicates; and had he turned
to that chapter he would have seen that his description of the genesis of moral sentiments
out of organized experiences is not such a one as I should have given. Let me quote a passage
from that chapter.

     "Not only are those emotions which form the immediate stimuli to
     actions, thus explicable; but the like explanation applies to the
     emotions that leave the subject of them comparatively passive: as,
     for instance, the emotion produced by beautiful scenery. The
     gradually increasing complexity in the groups of sensations and
     ideas co-ordinated, ends in the co-ordination of those vast
     aggregations of them which a grand landscape excites and suggests.
     The infant taken into the midst of mountains, is totally unaffected
     by them; but is delighted with the small group of attributes and
     relations presented in a toy. The child can appreciate, and be
     pleased with, the more complicated relations of household objects
     and localities, the garden, the field, and the street. But it is
     only in youth and mature age, when individual things and small
     assemblages of them have become familiar and automatically
     cognizable, that those immense assemblages which landscapes present
     can be adequately grasped, and the highly aggregated states of
     consciousness produced by them, experienced. Then, however, the
     various minor groups of states that have been in earlier days
     severally produced by trees, by fields, by streams, by cascades, by
     rocks, by precipices, by mountains, by clouds, are aroused
     together. Along with the sensations immediately received, there are
     partially excited the myriads of sensations that have been in times
     past received from objects such as those presented; further, there
     are partially excited the various incidental feelings that were
     experienced on all these countless past occasions; and there are
     probably also excited certain deeper, but now vague combinations of
     states, that were organized in the race during barbarous times,
     when its pleasurable activities were chiefly among the woods and
     waters. And out of all these excitations, some of them actual but
     most of them nascent, is composed the emotion which a fine
     landscape produces in us."

It is, I think, amply manifest that the processes here indicated are not to be taken as intellectual
processes--not as processes in which recognized relations between pleasures and their antecedents,
or intelligent adaptations of means to ends, form the dominant elements. The state of mind
produced by an aggregate of picturesque objects is not one resolvable into propositions. The
sentiment does not contain within itself any consciousness of causes and consequences of happiness.
The vague recollections of other beautiful scenes and other delightful days which it dimly
rouses, are not aroused because of any rational co-ordinations of ideas that have been formed
in bygone years. Mr. Hutton, however, assumes that in speaking of the genesis of moral feelings
as due to inherited experiences of the pleasures and pains caused by certain modes of conduct,
I am speaking of reasoned-out experiences--experiences consciously accumulated and generalized.
He overlooks the fact that the genesis of emotions is distinguished from the genesis of ideas
in this; that whereas the ideas are composed of elements that are simple, definitely related,
and (in the case of general ideas) constantly related, emotions are composed of enormously
complex aggregates of elements that are never twice alike, and which stand in relations that
are never twice alike. The difference in the resulting modes of consciousness is this:--In
the genesis of an idea the successive experiences, be they of sounds, colours, touches, tastes,
or be they of the special objects which combine many of these into groups, have so much in
common that each, when it occurs, can be definitely thought of as like those which preceded
it. But in the genesis of an emotion the successive experiences so far differ that each of
them, when it occurs, suggests past experiences which are not specifically similar, but have
only a general similarity; and, at the same time, it suggests benefits or evils in past experience
which likewise are various in their special natures, though they have a certain community in
general nature. Hence it results that the consciousness aroused is a multitudinous, confused
consciousness, in which, along with a certain kind of combination among the impressions received
from without, there is a vague cloud of ideal combinations akin to them, and a vague mass of
ideal feelings of pleasure or pain which were associated with these. We have abundant proof
that feelings grow up without reference to recognized causes and consequences, and without
the possessor of them being able to say why they have grown up; though analysis, nevertheless,
shows that they have been formed out of connected experiences. The familiar fact that a kind
of jam which was, during childhood, repeatedly taken after medicine, may become, by simple
association of sensations, so nauseous that it cannot be tolerated in after-life, illustrates
clearly the way in which repugnances may be established by habitual association of feelings,
without any belief in causal connexion; or rather, in spite of the knowledge that there is
no causal connexion. Similarly with pleasurable emotions. The cawing of rooks is not in itself
an agreeable sound: musically considered, it is very much the contrary. Yet the cawing of rooks
usually produces in people feelings of a grateful kind--feelings which most of them suppose
to result from the quality of the sound itself. Only the few who are given to self-analysis
are aware that the cawing of rooks is agreeable to them because it has been connected with
countless of their greatest gratifications--with the gathering of wild flowers in childhood;
with Saturday-afternoon excursions in school-boy days; with midsummer holidays in the country,
when books were thrown aside and lessons were replaced by games and adventures in the fields;
with fresh, sunny mornings in after-years, when a walking excursion was an immense relief from
toil. As it is, this sound, though not causally related to all these multitudinous and varied
past delights, but only often associated with them, can no more be heard without rousing a
dim consciousness of these delights, than the voice of an old friend unexpectedly coming into
the house can be heard without suddenly raising a wave of that feeling that has resulted from
the pleasures of past companionship. If we are to understand the genesis of emotions, either
in the individual or in the race, we must take account of this all-important process. Mr. Hutton,
however, apparently overlooking it, and not having reminded himself, by referring to the Principles
of Psychology, that I insist upon it, represents my hypothesis to be that a certain sentiment
results from the consolidation of intellectual conclusions! He speaks of me as believing that
"what seems to us now the 'necessary' intuitions and a priori assumptions of human nature,
are likely to prove, when scientifically analysed, nothing but a similar conglomeration of
our ancestors' best observations and most useful empirical rules." He supposes me to think
that men having, in past times, come to see that truthfulness was useful, "the habit of approving
truth-speaking and fidelity to engagements, which was first based on this ground of utility,
became so rooted, that the utilitarian ground of it was forgotten, and we find ourselves springing
to the belief in truth-speaking and fidelity to engagements from an inherited tendency." Similarly
throughout, Mr. Hutton has so used the word "utility," and so interpreted it on my behalf,
as to make me appear to mean that moral sentiment is formed out of conscious generalizations
respecting what is beneficial and what detrimental. Were such my hypothesis, his criticisms
would be very much to the point; but as such is not my hypothesis, they fall to the ground.
The experiences of utility I refer to are those which become registered, not as distinctly
recognized connexions between certain kinds of acts and certain kinds of remote results, but
those which become registered in the shape of associations between groups of feelings that
have often recurred together, though the relation between them has not been consciously generalized--associations
the origin of which may be as little perceived as is the origin of the pleasure given by the
sounds of a rookery; but which, nevertheless, have arisen in the course of daily converse with
things, and serve as incentives or deterrents.

In the paragraph which Mr. Hutton has extracted from my letter to Mr. Mill, I have indicated
an analogy between those effects of emotional experiences out of which I believe moral sentiments
have been developed, and those effects of intellectual experiences out of which I believe space-intuitions
have been developed. Rightly considering that the first of these hypotheses cannot stand if
the last is disproved, Mr. Hutton has directed part of his attack against this last. But would
it not have been well if he had referred to the Principles of Psychology, where this last hypothesis
is set forth at length, before criticising it? Would it not have been well to give an abstract
of my own description of the process, instead of substituting what he supposes my description
must be? Any one who turns to the Principles of Psychology (first edition, pp. 218-245), and
reads the two chapters, "The Perception of Body as presenting Statical Attributes", and "The
Perception of Space", will find that Mr. Hutton's account of my view on this matter has given
him no notion of the view as it is expressed by me; and will, perhaps, be less inclined to
smile than he was when he read Mr. Hutton's account. I cannot here do more than thus imply
the invalidity of such part of Mr. Hutton's argument as proceeds upon this incorrect representation.
The pages which would be required for properly explaining the doctrine that space-intuitions
result from organized experiences may be better used for explaining this analogous doctrine
at present before us. This I will now endeavour to do; not indirectly by correcting misapprehensions,
but directly by an exposition which shall be as brief as the extremely involved nature of the
process allows.

An infant in arms, when old enough to gaze at objects around with some vague recognition, smiles
in response to the laughing face and soft caressing voice of its mother. Let there come some
one who, with an angry face, speaks to it in loud, harsh tones. The smile disappears, the features
contract into an expression of pain, and, beginning to cry, it turns away its head, and makes
such movements of escape as are possible. What is the meaning of these facts? Why does not
the frown make it smile, and the mother's laugh make it weep? There is but one answer. Already
in its developing brain there is coming into play the structure through which one cluster of
visual and auditory impressions excites pleasurable feelings, and the structure through which
another cluster of visual and auditory impressions excites painful feelings. The infant knows
no more about the relation existing between a ferocious expression of face, and the evils which
may follow perception of it, than the young bird just out of its nest knows of the possible
pain and death which may be inflicted by a man coming towards it; and as certainly in the one
case as in the other, the alarm felt is due to a partially-established nervous structure. Why
does this partially-established nervous structure betray its presence thus early in the human
being? Simply because, in the past experiences of the human race, smiles and gentle tones in
those around have been the habitual accompaniments of pleasurable feelings; while pains of
many kinds, immediate and more or less remote, have been continually associated with the impressions
received from knit brows, and set teeth, and grating voice. Much deeper down than the history
of the human race must we go to find the beginnings of these connexions. The appearances and
sounds which excite in the infant a vague dread, indicate danger; and do so because they are
the physiological accompaniments of destructive action--some of them common to man and inferior
mammals, and consequently understood by inferior mammals, as every puppy shows us. What we
call the natural language of anger, is due to a partial contraction of those muscles which
actual combat would call into play; and all marks of irritation, down to that passing shade
over the brow which accompanies slight annoyance, are incipient stages of these same contractions.
Conversely with the natural language of pleasure, and of that state of mind which we call amicable
feeling: this, too, has a physiological interpretation.[35]

Let us pass now from the infant in arms to the children in the nursery. What have the experiences
of each been doing in aid of the emotional development we are considering? While its limbs
have been growing more agile by exercise, its manipulative skill increasing by practice, its
perceptions of objects growing by use quicker, more accurate, more comprehensive; the associations
between these two sets of impressions received from those around, and the pleasures and pains
received along with them, or after them, have been by frequent repetition made stronger, and
their adjustments better. The dim sense of pain and the vague glow of delight which the infant
felt, have, in the urchin, severally taken shapes that are more definite. The angry voice of
a nursemaid no longer arouses only a formless feeling of dread, but also a specific idea of
the slap that may follow. The frown on the face of a bigger brother, along with the primitive,
indefinable sense of ill, brings the ideas of ills that are definable as kicks, and cuffs,
and pullings of hair, and losses of toys. The faces of parents, looking now sunny, now gloomy,
have grown to be respectively associated with multitudinous forms of gratification and multitudinous
forms of discomfort or privation. Hence these appearances and sounds, which imply amity or
enmity in those around, become symbolic of happiness and misery; so that eventually, perception
of the one set or the other can scarcely occur without raising a wave of pleasurable feeling
or of painful feeling. The body of this wave is still substantially of the same nature as it
was at first; for though in each of these multitudinous experiences a special set of facial
and vocal signs has been connected with a special set of pleasures or pains; yet since these
pleasures or pains have been immensely varied in their kinds and combinations, and since the
signs that preceded them were in no two cases quite alike, it results that even to the end
the consciousness produced remains as vague as it is voluminous. The thousands of partially-aroused
ideas resulting from past experiences are massed together and superposed, so as to form an
aggregate in which nothing is distinct, but which has the character of being pleasurable or
painful according to the nature of its original components: the chief difference between this
developed feeling and the feeling aroused in the infant being, that on bright or dark background
forming the body of it, may now be sketched out in thought the particular pleasures or pains
which the particular circumstances suggest as likely.

What must be the working of this process under the conditions of aboriginal life? The emotions
given to the young savage by the natural language of love and hate in the members of his tribe,
gain first a partial definiteness in respect to his intercourse with his family and playmates;
and he learns by experience the utility, in so far as his own ends are concerned, of avoiding
courses which call from others manifestations of anger, and taking courses which call from
them manifestations of pleasure. Not that he consciously generalizes. He does not at that age,
probably not at any age, formulate his experiences in the general principle that it is well
for him to do things which bring smiles, and to avoid doing things which bring frowns. What
happens is that having, in the way shown, inherited this connexion between the perception of
anger in others and the feeling of dread, and having discovered that certain acts of his bring
on this anger, he cannot subsequently think of committing one of these acts without thinking
of the resulting anger, and feeling more or less of the resulting dread. He has no thought
of the utility or inutility of the act itself: the deterrent is the mainly vague, but partially
definite, fear of evil that may follow. So understood, the deterring emotion is one which has
grown out of experiences of utility, using that word in its ethical sense; and if we ask why
this dreaded anger is called forth from others, we shall habitually find that it is because
the forbidden act entails pain somewhere--is negatived by utility. On passing from domestic
injunctions to injunctions current in the tribe, we see no less clearly how these emotions
produced by approbation and reprobation come to be connected in experience with actions which
are beneficial to the tribe, and actions which are detrimental to the tribe; and how there
consequently grow up incentives to the one class of actions and prejudices against the other
class. From early boyhood the young savage hears recounted the daring deeds of his chief--hears
them in words of praise, and sees all faces glowing with admiration. From time to time also
he listens while some one's cowardice is described in tones of scorn, and with contemptuous
metaphors, and sees him meet with derision and insult whenever he appears. That is to say,
one of the things that come to be associated in his mind with smiling faces, which are symbolical
of pleasures in general, is courage; and one of the things that come to be associated in his
mind with frowns and other marks of enmity, which form his symbol of unhappiness, is cowardice.
These feelings are not formed in him because he has reasoned his way to the truth that courage
is useful to the tribe, and, by implication, to himself, or to the truth that cowardice is
a cause of evil. In adult life he may perhaps see this; but he certainly does not see it at
the time when bravery is thus joined in his consciousness with all that is good, and cowardice
with all that is bad. Similarly there are produced in him feelings of inclination or repugnance
towards other lines of conduct that have become established or interdicted, because they are
beneficial or injurious to the tribe; though neither the young nor the adults know why they
have become established or interdicted. Instance the praiseworthiness of wife-stealing, and
the viciousness of marrying within the tribe.

We may now ascend a stage to an order of incentives and restraints derived from these. The
primitive belief is that every dead man becomes a demon, who is often somewhere at hand, may
at any moment return, may give aid or do mischief, and has to be continually propitiated. Hence
among other agents whose approbation or reprobation are contemplated by the savage as consequences
of his conduct, are the spirits of his ancestors. When a child he is told of their deeds, now
in triumphant tones, now in whispers of horror; and the instilled belief that they may inflict
some vaguely-imagined but fearful evil, or give some great help, becomes a powerful incentive
or deterrent. Especially does this happen when the story is of a chief, distinguished for his
strength, his ferocity, his persistence in that revenge on enemies which the experiences of
the savage make him regard as beneficial and virtuous. The consciousness that such a chief,
dreaded by neighbouring tribes, and dreaded, too, by members of his own tribe, may reappear
and punish those who have disregarded his injunctions, becomes a powerful motive. But it is
clear, in the first place, that the imagined anger and the imagined satisfaction of this deified
chief, are simply transfigured forms of the anger and satisfaction displayed by those around;
and that the feelings accompanying such imaginations have the same original root in the experiences
which have associated an average of painful results with the manifestation of another's anger,
and an average of pleasurable results with the manifestation of another's satisfaction. And
it is clear, in the second place, that the actions thus forbidden and encouraged must be mostly
actions that are respectively detrimental and beneficial to the tribe; since the successful
chief is usually a better judge than the rest, and has the preservation of the tribe at heart.
Hence experiences of utility, consciously or unconsciously organized, underlie his injunctions;
and the sentiments which prompt obedience are, though very indirectly and without the knowledge
of those who feel them, referable to experiences of utility.

This transfigured form of restraint, differing at first but little from the original form,
admits of immense development. Accumulating traditions, growing in grandeur as they are repeated
from generation to generation, make more and more superhuman the early-recorded hero of the
race. His powers of inflicting punishment and giving happiness become ever greater, more multitudinous,
and more varied; so that the dread of divine displeasure, and the desire to obtain divine approbation,
acquire a certain largeness and generality. Still the conceptions remain anthropomorphic. The
revengeful deity continues to be thought of in terms of human emotions, and continues to be
represented as displaying these emotions in human ways. Moreover, the sentiments of right and
duty, so far as they have become developed, refer mainly to divine commands and interdicts;
and have little reference to the natures of the acts commanded or interdicted. In the intended
offering-up of Isaac, in the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter, and in the hewing to pieces
of Agag, as much as in the countless atrocities committed from religious motives by various
early historic races, as by some existing savage races, we see that the morality and immorality
of actions, as we understand them, are at first little recognized; and that the feelings, chiefly
of dread, which serve in place of them, are feelings felt towards the unseen beings supposed
to issue the commands and interdicts.

Here it will be said that, as just admitted, these are not the moral sentiments properly so
called. They are simply sentiments that precede and make possible those highest sentiments
which do not refer either to personal benefits or evils to be expected from men, or to more
remote rewards and punishments. Several comments are, however, called forth by this criticism.
One is, that if we glance back at past beliefs and their correlative feelings, as shown in
Dante's poem, in the mystery-plays of the middle ages, in St. Bartholomew massacres, in burnings
for heresy, we get proof that in comparatively modern times right and wrong meant little else
than subordination or insubordination--to a divine ruler primarily, and under him to a human
ruler. The least, has therefore, our property he conferred of judge as of consequence which may be make
of presence in manifold, as it were, such as are make him by case. They will have not be largely
has leave nucleotide feelings of principles, but be simultaneously their tentative stages conferred
and has continue in the tunnel. His hypothesis, he aver, provided of stableness under fervid
sunshine logically as here as in improvement be advanced under specific
benefits.

those, and in emotions, one taxon strength have evolve from the. Geoffroy'it meant element improvement

Eventually these experiences may be consciously generalized, and there may result a deliberate
pursuit of sympathetic gratifications. There may also come to be distinctly recognized the
truths that the remoter results, kind and unkind conduct, are respectively beneficial and detrimental--that
due regard for others is conducive to ultimate personal welfare, and disregard of others to
ultimate personal disaster; and then there may become current such summations of experience
as "honesty is the best policy." But so far from regarding these intellectual recognitions
of utility as preceding and causing the moral sentiment, I regard the moral sentiment as preceding
such recognitions of utility, and making them possible. The pleasures and pains directly resulting
in experience from sympathetic and unsympathetic actions, had first to be slowly associated
with such actions, and the resulting incentives and deterrents frequently obeyed, before there
could arise the perceptions that sympathetic and unsympathetic actions are remotely beneficial
or detrimental to the actor; and they had to be obeyed still longer and more generally before
there could arise the perceptions that they are socially beneficial or detrimental. When, however,
the remote effects, personal and social, have gained general recognition, are expressed in
current maxims, and lead to injunctions having the religious sanction, the sentiments that
prompt sympathetic actions and check unsympathetic ones are immensely strengthened by their
alliances. Approbation and reprobation, divine and human, come to be associated in thought
with the sympathetic and unsympathetic actions respectively. The commands of the creed, the
legal penalties, and the code of social conduct, unitedly enforce them; and every child as
it grows up, daily has impressed on it by the words and faces and voices of those around the
authority of these highest principles of conduct. And now we may see why there arises a belief
in the special sacredness of these highest principles, and a sense of the supreme authority
of the altruistic sentiments answering to them. Many of the actions which, in early social
states, received the religious sanction and gained public approbation, had the drawback that
such sympathies as existed were outraged, and there was hence an imperfect satisfaction. Whereas
these altruistic actions, while similarly having the religious sanction and gaining public
approbation, bring a sympathetic consciousness of pleasure given or of pain prevented; and,
beyond this, bring a sympathetic consciousness of human welfare at large, as being furthered
by making altruistic actions habitual. Both this special and this general sympathetic consciousness
become stronger and wider in proportion as the power of mental representation increases, and
the imagination of consequences, immediate and remote, grows more vivid and comprehensive.
Until at length these altruistic sentiments begin to call in question the authority of those
ego-altruistic sentiments which once ruled unchallenged. They prompt resistance to laws that
do not fulfil the conception of justice, encourage men to brave the frowns of their fellows
by pursuing a course at variance with customs that are perceived to be socially injurious,
and even cause dissent from the current religion; either to the extent of disbelief in those
alleged divine attributes and acts not approved by this supreme moral arbiter, or to the extent
of entire rejection of a creed which ascribes such attributes and acts.

Much that is required to make this hypothesis complete must stand over until, at the close
of the second volume of the Principles of Psychology, I have space for a full exposition. What
I have said will make it sufficiently clear that two fundamental errors have been made in the
interpretation put upon it. Both Utility and Experience have been construed in senses much
too narrow. Utility, convenient a word as it is from its comprehensiveness, has very inconvenient
and misleading implications. It vividly suggests uses, and means, and proximate ends, but very
faintly suggests the pleasures, positive or negative, which are the ultimate ends, and which,
in the ethical meaning of the word, are alone considered; and, further, it implies conscious
recognition of means and ends--implies the deliberate taking of some course to gain a perceived
benefit. Experience, too, in its ordinary acceptation, connotes definite perceptions of causes
and consequences, as standing in observed relations, and is not taken to include the connexions
formed in consciousness between states that recur together, when the relation between them,
causal or other, is not perceived. It is in their widest senses, however, that I habitually
use these words, as will be manifest to every one who reads the Principles of Psychology; and
it is in their widest senses that I have used them in the letter to Mr. Mill. I think I have
shown above that, when they are so understood, the hypothesis briefly set forth in that letter
is by no means so indefensible as is supposed. At any rate, I have shown--what seemed for the
present needful to show--that Mr. Hutton's versions of my views must not be accepted as correct.

THE COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY OF MAN.

    [Originally read before the Anthropological Institute, and
    afterwards published in Mind, for January, 1876.]

While discussing with two members of the Anthropological Institute the work to be undertaken
by its psychological section, I made certain suggestions which they requested me to put in
writing. When reminded, some months after, of the promise I had made to do this, I failed to
recall the particular suggestions referred to; but in the endeavour to remember them, I was
led to glance over the whole subject of comparative human psychology. Hence resulted the following
paper.

That making a general survey is useful as a preliminary to deliberate study, either of a whole
or of any part, scarcely needs showing. Vagueness of thought accompanies the wandering about
in a region without known bounds or landmarks. Attention devoted to some portion of a subject
in ignorance of its connexion with the rest, leads to untrue conceptions. The whole cannot
be rightly conceived without some knowledge of the parts; and no part can be rightly conceived
out of relation to the whole.

To map out the Comparative Psychology of Man must also conduce to the more methodic carrying
on of inquiries. In this, as in other things, division of labour will facilitate progress;
and that there may be division of labour, the work itself must be systematically divided.

We may conveniently separate the entire subject into three main divisions, and may arrange
them in the order of increasing speciality.

The first division will treat of the degrees of mental evolution of different human types,
generally considered: taking account of both the mass of mental manifestation and the complexity
of mental manifestation. This division will include the relations of these characters to physical
characters--the bodily mass and structure, and the cerebral mass and structure. It will also
include inquiries concerning the time taken in completing mental evolution, and the time during
which adult mental power lasts; as well as certain most general traits of mental action, such
as the greater or less persistence of emotions and of intellectual processes. The connexion
between the general mental type and the general social type should also be here dealt with.

In the second division may be conveniently placed apart, inquiries concerning the relative
mental natures of the sexes in each race. Under it will come such questions as these:--What
differences of mental mass and mental complexity, if any, existing between males and females,
are common to all races? Do such differences vary in degree, or in kind, or in both? Are there
reasons for thinking that they are liable to change by increase or decrease? What relations
do they bear in each case to the habits of life, the domestic arrangements, and the social
arrangements? This division should also include in its scope the sentiments of the sexes towards
one another, considered as varying quantitatively and qualitatively; as well as their respective
sentiments towards offspring, similarly varying.

For the third division of inquiries may be reserved the more special mental traits distinguishing
different types of men. One class of such specialities results from differences of proportion
among faculties possessed in common; and another class results from the presence in some races
of faculties that are almost or quite absent from others. Each difference in each of these
groups, when established by comparison, has to be studied in connexion with the stage of mental
evolution reached, and has to be studied in connexion with the habits of life and the social
development, regarding it as related to these both as cause and as consequence.

Such being the outlines of these several divisions, let us now consider in detail the subdivisions
contained within each.

       *       *       *       *       *

I.--Under the head of general mental evolution we may begin with the trait of--

1. Mental mass.--Daily experiences show us that human beings differ in volume of mental manifestation.
Some there are whose intelligence, high though it may be, produces little impression on those
around; while there are some who, when uttering even commonplaces, do it so as to affect listeners
in a disproportionate degree. Comparison of two such, makes it manifest that, generally, the
difference is due to the natural language of the emotions. Behind the intellectual quickness
of the one there is not felt any power of character; while the other betrays a momentum capable
of bearing down opposition--a potentiality of emotion that has something formidable about it.
Obviously the varieties of mankind differ much in respect of this trait. Apart from kind of
feeling, they are unlike in amount of feeling. The dominant races overrun the inferior races
mainly in virtue of the greater quantity of energy in which this greater mental mass shows
itself. Hence a series of inquiries, of which these are some:--(a) What is the relation between
mental mass and bodily mass? Manifestly, the small races are deficient in it. But it also appears
that races much upon a par in size--as, for instance, an Englishman and a Damara, differ considerably
in mental mass. (b) What is its relation to mass of brain? and, bearing in mind the general
law that in the same species, size of brain increases with size of body (though not in the
same proportion), how far can we connect the extra mental mass of the higher races, with an
extra mass of brain beyond that which is proper to their greater bodily mass? (c) What relation,
if any, is there between mental mass and the physiological state expressed in vigour of circulation
and richness of blood, as severally determined by mode of life and general nutrition? (d) What
are the relations of this trait to the social state, as nomadic or settled, predatory or industrial?

2. Mental complexity.--How races differ in respect of the more or less involved structures
of their minds, will best be understood on recalling the unlikeness between the juvenile mind
and the adult mind among ourselves. In the child we see absorption in special facts. Generalities
even of a low order are scarcely recognized, and there is no recognition of high generalities.
We see interest in individuals, in personal adventures, in domestic affairs, but no interest
in political or social matters. We see vanity about clothes and small achievements, but little
sense of justice: witness the forcible appropriation of one another's toys. While there have
come into play many of the simpler mental powers, there has not yet been reached that complication
of mind which results from the addition of powers evolved out of these simpler ones. Kindred
differences of complexity exist between the minds of lower and higher races; and comparisons
should be made to ascertain their kinds and amounts. Here, too, there may be a subdivision
of the inquiries. (a) What is the relation between mental complexity and mental mass? Do not
the two habitually vary together? (b) What is the relation to the social state, as more or
less complex? that is to say--Do not mental complexity and social complexity act and react
on each other?

3. Rate of mental development.--In conformity with the biological law that the higher the organisms
the longer they take to evolve, members of the inferior human races may be expected to complete
their mental evolution sooner than members of the superior races; and we have evidence that
they do this. Travellers from many regions comment, now on the great precocity of children
among savage and semi-civilized peoples, and now on the early arrest of their mental progress.
Though we scarcely need more proofs that this general contrast exists, there remains to be
asked the question, whether it is consistently maintained throughout all groups of races, from
the lowest to the highest--whether, say, the Australian differs in this respect from the Hindu,
as much as the Hindu does from the European. Of secondary inquiries coming under this sub-head
may be named several. (a) Is this more rapid evolution and earlier arrest always unequally
shown by the two sexes; or, in other words, are there in lower types proportional differences
in rate and degree of development, such as higher types show us? (b) Is there in many cases,
as there appears to be in some cases, a traceable relation between the period of arrest and
the period of puberty? (c) Is mental decay early in proportion as mental evolution is rapid?
(d) Can we in other respects assert that where the type is low, the entire cycle of mental
changes between birth and death--ascending, uniform, descending--comes within a shorter interval?

4. Relative plasticity.--Is there any relation between the degree of mental modifiability which
remains in adult life, and the character of the mental evolution in respect of mass, complexity,
and rapidity? The animal kingdom at large yields reasons for associating an inferior and more
rapidly-completed mental structure, with a relatively automatic nature. Lowly organized creatures,
guided almost entirely by reflex actions, are in but small degrees changeable by individual
experiences. As the nervous structure complicates, its actions become less rigorously confined
within pre-established limits; and as we approach the highest creatures, individual experiences
take larger and larger shares in moulding the conduct: there is an increasing ability to take
in new impressions and to profit by the acquisitions. Inferior and superior human races are
contrasted in this respect. Many travellers comment on the unchangeable habits of savages.
The semi-civilized nations of the East, past and present, were, or are, characterized by a
greater rigidity of custom than characterizes the more civilized nations of the West. The histories
of the most civilized nations show us that in their earlier times, the modifiability of ideas
and habits was less than it is at present. And if we contrast classes or individuals around
us, we see that the most developed in mind are the most plastic. To inquiries respecting this
trait of comparative plasticity, in its relations to precocity and early completion of mental
development, may fitly be added inquiries respecting its relations to the social state, which
it helps to determine, and which reacts upon it.

5. Variability.--To say of a mind that its actions are extremely inconstant, and at the same
time to say that it is of relatively unchangeable nature, apparently implies a contradiction.
When, however, the inconstancy is understood as referring to the manifestations which follow
one another from minute to minute, and the unchangeableness to the average manifestations,
extending over long periods, the apparent contradiction disappears; and it becomes comprehensible
that the two traits may, and ordinarily do, co-exist. An infant, quickly wearied with each
kind of perception, wanting ever a new object which it soon abandons for something else, and
alternating a score times a day between smiles and tears, shows us a very small persistence
in each kind of mental action: all its states, intellectual and emotional, are transient. Yet
at the same time its mind cannot be easily changed in character. True, it changes spontaneously
in due course; but it long remains incapable of receiving ideas or emotions beyond those of
simple orders. The child exhibits less rapid variations, intellectual and emotional, while
its educability is greater. Inferior human races show us this combination: great rigidity of
general character with great irregularity in its passing manifestations. Speaking broadly,
while they resist permanent modification, they lack intellectual persistence, and they lack
emotional persistence. Of various low types we read that they cannot keep the attention fixed
beyond a few minutes on anything requiring thought, even of a simple kind. Similarly with their
feelings: these are less enduring than those of civilized men. There are, however, qualifications
to be made in this statement; and comparisons are needed to ascertain how far these qualifications
go. The savage shows great persistence in the action of the lower intellectual faculties. He
is untiring in minute observation. He is untiring, also, in that kind of perceptive activity
which accompanies the making of his weapons and ornaments: often persevering for immense periods
in carving stones, &c. Emotionally, too, he shows persistence not only in the motives prompting
these small industries, but also in certain of his passions--especially in that of revenge.
Hence, in studying the degrees of mental variability shown us in the daily lives of the different
races, we must ask how far variability characterizes the whole mind, and how far it holds only
of parts of the mind.

6. Impulsiveness.--This trait is closely allied with the last: unenduring emotions are emotions
which sway the conduct now this way and now that, without any consistency. The trait of impulsiveness
may, however, be fitly dealt with separately, because it has other implications than mere lack
of persistence. Comparisons of the lower human races with the higher, appear generally to show
that, along with brevity of the passions, there goes violence. The sudden gusts of feeling
which men of inferior types display, are excessive in degree as they are short in duration;
and there is probably a connexion between these two traits: intensity sooner producing exhaustion.
Observing that the passions of childhood illustrate this connexion, let us turn to certain
interesting questions concerning the decrease of impulsiveness which accompanies advance in
evolution. The nervous processes of an impulsive being, are less remote from reflex actions
than are those of an unimpulsive being. In reflex actions we see a simple stimulus passing
suddenly into movement: little or no control being exercised by other parts of the nervous
system. As we ascend to higher actions, guided by more and more complicated combinations of
stimuli, there is not the same instantaneous discharge in simple motions; but there is a comparatively
deliberate and more variable adjustment of compound motions, duly restrained and proportioned.
It is thus with the passions and sentiments in the less developed natures and in the more developed
natures. Where there is but little emotional complexity, an emotion, when excited by some occurrence,
explodes in action before the other emotions have been called into play; and each of these,
from time to time, does the like. But the more complex emotional structure is one in which
these simpler emotions are so co-ordinated that they do not act independently. Before excitement
of any one has had time to cause action, some excitement has been communicated to others--often
antagonistic ones; and the conduct becomes modified in adjustment to the combined dictates.
Hence results a decreased impulsiveness, and also a greater persistence. The conduct pursued,
being prompted by several emotions co-operating in degrees which do not exhaust them, acquires
a greater continuity; and while spasmodic force becomes less conspicuous, there is an increase
in the total energy. Examining the facts from this point of view, there are sundry questions
of interest to be put respecting the different races of men. (a) To what other traits than
degree of mental evolution is impulsiveness related? Apart from difference in elevation of
type, the New-World races seem to be less impulsive than the Old-World races. Is this due to
constitutional apathy? Can there be traced (other things equal) a relation between physical
vivacity and mental impulsiveness? (b) What connexion is there between this trait and the social
state? Clearly a very explosive nature--such as that of the Bushman--is unfit for social union;
and, commonly, social union, when by any means established, checks impulsiveness. (c) What
respective shares in checking impulsiveness are taken by the feelings which the social state
fosters--such as the fear of surrounding individuals, the instinct of sociality, the desire
to accumulate property, the sympathetic feelings, the sentiment of justice? These, which require
a social environment for their development, all of them involve imaginations of consequences
more or less distant; and thus imply checks upon the promptings of the simpler passions. Hence
arise the questions--In what order, in what degrees, and in what combinations, do they come
into play?

7. One further general inquiry of a different kind may be added. What effect is produced on
mental nature by mixture of races? There is reason for believing that throughout the animal
kingdom, the union of varieties which have become widely divergent is physically injurious;
while the union of slightly divergent varieties is physically beneficial. Does the like hold
with the mental nature? Some facts seem to show that mixture of human races extremely unlike,
produces a worthless type of mind--a mind fitted neither for the kind of life led by the higher
of the two races, nor for that led by the lower--a mind out of adjustment to all conditions
of life. Contrariwise, we find that peoples of the same stock, slightly differentiated by lives
carried on in unlike circumstances for many generations, produce by mixture a mental type having
certain superiorities. In his work on The Huguenots, Mr. Smiles points out how large a number
of distinguished men among us have descended from Flemish and French refugees; and M. Alphonse
de Candolle, in his Histoire des Sciences et des Savants depuis deux Siècles, shows that the
descendants of French refugees in Switzerland have produced an unusually great proportion of
scientific men. Though, in part, this result may be ascribed to the original natures of such
refugees, who must have had that independence which is a chief factor in originality, yet it
is probably in part due to mixtures of races. For thinking this, we have evidence which is
not open to two interpretations. Prof. Morley draws attention to the fact that, during seven
hundred years of our early history "the best genius of England sprang up on the line of country
in which Celts and Anglo-Saxons came together." In like manner Mr. Galton, in his English Men
of Science, shows that in recent days these have mostly come from an inland region, running
generally from north to south, which we may reasonably presume contains more mixed blood than
do the regions east and west of it. Such a result seems probable a priori. Two natures respectively
adapted to slightly unlike sets of social conditions, may be expected by their union to produce
a nature somewhat more plastic than either--a nature more impressible by the new circumstances
of advancing social life, and therefore more likely to originate new ideas and display modified
sentiments. The Comparative Psychology of Man may, then, fitly include the mental effects of
mixture; and among derivative inquiries we may ask--How far the conquest of race by race has
been instrumental in advancing civilization by aiding mixture, as well as in other ways.

II.--The second of the three leading divisions named at the outset is less extensive. Still,
concerning the relative mental natures of the sexes in each race, questions of much interest
and importance may be raised.

1. Degree of difference between the sexes.--It is an established fact that, physically considered,
the contrast between males and females is not equally great in all types of mankind. The bearded
races, for instance, show us a greater unlikeness between the two than do the beardless races.
Among South American tribes, men and women have a greater general resemblance in form, &c.,
than is usual elsewhere. The question, then, suggests itself--Do the mental natures of the
sexes differ in a constant or in a variable degree? The difference is unlikely to be a constant
one; and, looking for variation, we may ask what is its amount, and under what conditions does
it occur?

2. Difference in mass and in complexity.--The comparisons between the sexes, of course, admit
of subdivisions parallel to those made in the comparisons between races. Relative mental mass
and relative mental complexity have chiefly to be observed. Assuming that the great inequality
in the cost of reproduction to the two sexes, is the cause of unlikeness in mental mass, as
in physical mass, this difference may be studied in connexion with reproductive differences
presented by the various races, in respect of the ages at which reproduction commences, and
the periods over which it lasts. An allied inquiry may be joined with this; namely, how far
the mental developments of the two sexes are affected by their relative habits in respect to
food and physical exertion? In many of the lower races, the women, treated with great brutality,
are, physically, much inferior to the men: excess of labour and defect of nutrition being apparently
the combined causes. Is any arrest of mental development simultaneously caused?

3. Variation of the differences.--If the unlikeness, physical and mental, of the sexes is not
constant, then, supposing all races have diverged from one original stock, it follows that
there must have been transmission of accumulated differences to those of the same sex in posterity.
If, for instance, the prehistoric type of man was beardless, then the production of a bearded
variety implies that within that variety the males continued to transmit an increasing amount
of beard to descendants of the same sex. This limitation of heredity by sex, shown us in multitudinous
ways throughout the animal kingdom, probably applies to the cerebral structures as much as
to other structures. Hence the question--Do not the mental natures of the sexes in alien types
of Man diverge in unlike ways and degrees?

4. Causes of the differences.--Are any relations to be traced between these variable differences
and the variable parts the sexes play in the business of life? Assuming the cumulative effects
of habit on function and structure, as well as the limitation of heredity by sex, it is to
be expected that if, in any society, the activities of one sex, generation after generation,
differ from those of the other, there will arise sexual adaptations of mind. Some instances
in illustration may be named. Among the Africans of Loango and other districts, as also among
some of the Indian Hill-tribes, the men and women are strongly contrasted as respectively inert
and energetic: the industry of the women having apparently become so natural to them that no
coercion is needed. Of course, such facts suggest an extensive series of questions. Limitation
of heredity by sex may account both for those sexual differences of mind which distinguish
men and women in all races, and for those which distinguish them in each race, or each society.
An interesting subordinate inquiry may be, how far such mental differences are inverted in
cases where there is inversion of social and domestic relations; as among those Khasi Hill-tribes,
whose women have so far the upper hand that they turn off their husbands in a summary way if
they displease them.

5. Mental modifiability in the two sexes.--Along with comparisons of races in respect of mental
plasticity may go parallel comparisons of the sexes in each race. Is it true always, as it
appears to be generally true, that women are less modifiable than men? The relative conservatism
of women--their greater adhesion to established ideas and practices--is manifest in many civilized
and semi-civilized societies. Is it so among the uncivilized? A curious instance of stronger
attachment to custom in women than in men is given by Dalton, as occurring among the Juangs,
one of the lowest wild tribes of Bengal. Until recently the only dress of both sexes was something
less than that which the Hebrew legend gives to Adam and Eve. Years ago the men were led to
adopt a cloth bandage round the loins, in place of the bunch of leaves; but the women adhered
to the aboriginal habit: a conservatism shown where it might have been least expected.

6. The sexual sentiment.--Results of value may be looked for from comparisons of races made
to determine the amounts and characters of the higher feelings to which the relation of the
sexes gives rise. The lowest varieties of mankind have but small endowments of these feelings.
Among varieties of higher types, such as the Malayo-Polynesians, these feelings seem considerably
developed: the Dyaks, for instance, sometimes display them in great strength. Speaking generally,
they appear to become stronger with the advance of civilization. Several subordinate inquiries
may be named. (a) How far is development of the sexual sentiment dependent upon intellectual
advance--upon growth of imaginative power? (b) How far is it related to emotional advance;
and especially to evolution of those emotions which originate from sympathy? What are its relations
to polyandry and polygyny? (c) Does it not tend towards, and is it not fostered by, monogamy?
(d) What connexion has it with maintenance of the family bond, and the consequent better rearing
of children?

III.--Under the third head, to which we may now pass come the more special traits of the different
races.

1. Imitativeness.--One of the characteristics in which the lower types of men show us a smaller
departure from reflex action than do the higher types, is their strong tendency to mimic the
motions and sounds made by others--an almost involuntary habit which travellers find it difficult
to check. This meaningless repetition, which seems to imply that the idea of an observed action
cannot be framed in the mind of the observer without tending forthwith to discharge itself
in the action conceived (and every ideal action is a nascent form of the consciousness accompanying
performance of such action), evidently diverges but little from the automatic; and decrease
of it is to be expected along with increase of self-regulating power. This trait of automatic
mimicry is evidently allied with that less automatic mimicry which shows itself in greater
persistence of customs. For customs adopted by each generation from the last without thought
or inquiry, imply a tendency to imitate which overmasters critical and sceptical tendencies:
so maintaining habits for which no reasons can be given. The decrease of this irrational mimicry,
strongest in the lowest savage and feeblest in the highest of the civilized, should be studied
along with the successively higher stages of social life, as being at once an aid and a hindrance
to civilization: an aid in so far as it gives that fixity to the social organization without
which a society cannot survive; a hindrance in so far as it offers resistance to changes of
social organization that have become desirable.

2. Incuriosity.--Projecting our own natures into the circumstances of the savage, we imagine
ourselves as marvelling greatly on first seeing the products and appliances of civilized life.
But we err in supposing that the savage has feelings such as we should have in his place. Want
of rational curiosity respecting these incomprehensible novelties, is a trait remarked of the
lowest races wherever found; and the partially-civilized races are distinguished from them
as exhibiting rational curiosity. The relation of this trait to the intellectual nature, to
the emotional nature, and to the social state, should be studied.

3. Quality of thought.--Under this vague head may be placed many sets of inquiries, each of
them extensive--(a) The degree of generality of the ideas; (b) the degree of abstractness of
the ideas; (c) the degree of definiteness of the ideas; (d) the degree of coherence of the
ideas; (e) the extent to which there have been developed such notions as those of class, of
cause, of uniformity, of law, of truth. Many conceptions which have become so familiar to us
that we assume them to be the common property of all minds, are no more possessed by the lowest
savages than they are by our own children; and comparisons of types should be so made as to
elucidate the processes by which such conceptions are reached. The development under each head
has to be observed--(a) independently in its successive stages; (b) in connexion with the co-operative
intellectual conceptions; (c) in connexion with the progress of language, of the arts, and
of social organization. Already linguistic phenomena have been used in aid of such inquiries;
and more systematic use of them should be made. Not only the number of general words, and the
number of abstract words, in a people's vocabulary should be taken as evidence, but also their
degrees of generality and abstractness; for there are generalities of the first, second, third,
&c., orders, and abstractions similarly ascending. Blue is an abstraction referring to one
class of impressions derived from visible objects; colour is a higher abstraction referring
to many such classes of visual impressions; property is a still higher abstraction referring
to classes of impressions received not through the eyes alone, but through other sense-organs.
If generalities and abstractions were arranged in the order of their extensiveness and in the
order of their grades, tests would be obtained which, applied to the vocabularies of the uncivilized,
would yield definite evidence of the intellectual stages reached.

4. Peculiar aptitudes.--To such specialities of intelligence as mark different degrees of evolution,
have to be added minor ones related to modes of life: the kinds and degrees of faculty which
have become organized in adaptation to daily habits--skill in the use of weapons, powers of
tracking, quick discrimination of individual objects. And under this head may fitly come inquiries
concerning some race-peculiarities of the æsthetic class, not at present explicable. While
the remains from the Dordogne caves show us that their inhabitants, low as we must suppose
them to have been, could represent animals, both by drawing and carving, with some degree of
fidelity; there are existing races, probably higher in other respects, who seem scarcely capable
of recognizing pictorial representations. Similarly with the musical faculty. Almost or quite
wanting in some inferior races, we find it in other races not of high grade, developed to an
unexpected degree: instance the Negroes, some of whom are so innately musical, that, as I have
been told by a missionary among them, the children in native schools when taught European psalm-tunes,
spontaneously sing seconds to them. Whether any causes can be discovered for race peculiarities
of this kind, is a question of interest.

5. Specialities of emotional nature.--These are worthy of careful study, as being intimately
related to social phenomena--to the possibility of social progress, and to the nature of the
social structure. Among others to be noted there are--(a) Gregariousness or sociality--a trait
in the strength of which races differ widely: some, as the Mantras, being almost indifferent
to social intercourse; some being unable to dispense with it. Obviously the degree of this
desire for the presence of fellow-men, affects greatly the formation of social groups, and
consequently influences social progress. (b) Intolerance of restraint. Men of some inferior
types, as the Mapuché, are ungovernable; while those of other types, no higher in grade, not
only submit to restraint, but admire the persons exercising it. These contrasted natures have
to be observed in connexion with social evolution; to the early stages of which they are respectively
antagonistic and favourable. (c) The desire for praise is a trait which, common to all races,
high and low, varies considerably in degree. There are quite inferior races, as some of those
in the Pacific States, whose members sacrifice without stint to gain the applause which lavish
generosity brings; while, elsewhere, applause is sought with less eagerness. Notice should
be taken of the connexion between this love of approbation and the social restraints; since
it plays an important part in the maintenance of them. (d) The acquisitive propensity. This,
too, is a character the degrees of which, and the relations of which to the social state, have
to be especially noted. The desire for property grows along with the possibility of gratifying
it; and this, extremely small among the lowest men, increases as social development goes on.
With the advance from tribal property to family property and individual property, the notion
of private right of possession gains definiteness, and the love of acquisition strengthens.
Each step towards an orderly social state makes larger accumulations possible, and the pleasures
achievable by them more sure; while the resulting encouragement to accumulate, leads to increase
of capital and to further progress. This action and re-action of the sentiment and the social
state, should be in every case observed.

6. The altruistic sentiments.--Coming last, these are also highest. The evolution of them in
the course of civilization, shows us clearly the reciprocal influences of the social unit and
the social organism. On the one hand, there can be no sympathy, nor any of the sentiments which
sympathy generates, unless there are fellow-beings around. On the other hand, maintenance of
union with fellow-beings depends in part on the presence of sympathy, and the resulting restraints
on conduct. Gregariousness or sociality favours the growth of sympathy; increased sympathy
conduces to closer sociality and a more stable social state; and so, continuously, each increment
of the one makes possible a further increment of the other. Comparisons of the altruistic sentiments
resulting from sympathy, as exhibited in different types of men and different social states,
may be conveniently arranged under three heads--(a) Pity, which should be observed as displayed
towards offspring, towards the sick and aged, and towards enemies. (b) Generosity (duly discriminated
from the love of display) as shown in giving; as shown in the relinquishment of pleasures for
the sake of others; as shown by active efforts on others' behalf. The manifestations of this
sentiment, too, are to be noted in respect of their range--whether they are limited to relatives;
whether they extend only to those of the same society; whether they extend to those of other
societies; and they are also to be noted in connexion with the degree of providence--whether
they result from sudden impulses obeyed without counting the cost, or go along with clear foresight
of the future sacrifices entailed. Those is some structure from these or less laden with trophies in
animal, in transmission, pleasure, and obfuscation. The multitude by Linnaeus in the "golden history,"
the 1900s, had come by evolution, thousand, of insects to millenary, and of plants from thousand.
But refuse the addition as borderland to exemplification, treble it take to bottom-feeder, the numerousness

Cavendish, by facts of English. The was the use plano-mr, placed of distance, in behalf of single-convex

The improvement is however the significant was make by the alienation of Dr. Wollaston himself

 Had the egg, instead of being broken by the cook, been left under the hen
for a certain time, the yelk would have passed by infinitesimal gradations through a series
of forms ending in the chick; and by similarly infinitesimal gradations would have arisen those
functions which end in the chick breaking its shell; and which, when it gets out, show themselves
in running about, distinguishing and picking up food, and squeaking if hurt. When did the feeling
begin? and how did there come into existence that power of perception which the chick's actions
show? Should it be objected that the chick's actions are mainly automatic, I will not dwell
on the fact that, though they are largely so, the chick manifestly has feeling and therefore
consciousness; but I will accept the objection, and propose that instead we take the human
being. The course of development before birth is just of the same general kind; and similarly,
at a certain stage, begins to be accompanied by reflex movements. At birth there is displayed
an amount of mind certainly not greater than that of the chick: there is no power of running
from danger--no power of distinguishing and picking up food. If we say the chick is unintelligent,
we must certainly say the infant is unintelligent. And yet from the unintelligence of the infant
to the intelligence of the adult, there is an advance by steps so small that on no day is the
amount of mind shown, appreciably different from that shown on preceding and succeeding days.

Thus the tacit assumption that there exists a break, is not simply gratuitous, but is negatived
by the most obvious facts.

       *       *       *       *       *

Certain of the words and phrases used in explaining that particular part of the Doctrine of
Evolution which deals with the origin of species, are commented upon by Mr. Martineau as having
implications justifying his view. Let us consider his comments.

He says that competition is not an "original power, which can of itself do anything;" further,
that "it cannot act except in the presence of some possibility of a better or worse;" and that
this "possibility of a better or worse" implies a "world pre-arranged for progress," "a directing
Will intent upon the good." Had Mr. Martineau looked more closely into the matter, he would
have found that, though the words and phrases he quotes are used for convenience, the conceptions
they imply are not at all essential to the doctrine. Under its rigorously-scientific form,
the doctrine is expressible in purely-physical terms, which neither imply competition nor imply
better and worse.[37]

Beyond this indirect mistake there is a direct mistake. Mr. Martineau speaks of the "survivorship
of the better," as though that were the statement of the law; and then adds that the alleged
result cannot be inferred "except on the assumption that whatever is better is stronger too."
But the words he here uses are his own words, not the words of those he opposes. The law is
the survival of the fittest. Probably, in substituting "better" for "fittest," Mr. Martineau
did not suppose that he was changing the meaning; though I dare say he perceived that the meaning
of the word "fittest" did not suit his argument so well. Had he examined the facts, he would
have found that the law is not the survival of the "better" or the "stronger," if we give to
those words any thing like their ordinary meanings. It is the survival of those which are constitutionally
fittest to thrive under the conditions in which they are placed; and very often that which,
humanly speaking, is inferiority, causes the survival. Superiority, whether in size, strength,
activity, or sagacity, is, other things equal, at the cost of diminished fertility; and where
the life led by a species does not demand these higher attributes, the species profits by decrease
of them, and accompanying increase of fertility. This is the reason why there occur so many
cases of retrograde metamorphosis--this is the reason why parasites, internal and external,
are so commonly degraded forms of higher types. Survival of the "better" does not cover these
cases, though survival of the "fittest" does; and as I am responsible for the phrase, I suppose
I am competent to say that the word "fittest" was chosen for this reason. When it is remembered
that these cases outnumber all others--that there are more species of parasites than there
are species of all other animals put together--it will be seen that the expression "survivorship
of the better" is wholly inappropriate, and the argument Mr. Martineau bases upon it quite
untenable. Indeed, if, in place of those adjustments of the human sense-organs, which he so
eloquently describes as implying pre-arrangement, Mr. Martineau had described the countless
elaborate appliances which enable parasites to torture animals immeasurably superior to them,
and which, from his point of view, no less imply pre-arrangement, I think the notes of admiration
which end his descriptions would not have seemed to him so appropriate.

One more word there is from the intrinsic meaning of which Mr. Martineau deduces what appears
a powerful argument--the word Evolution itself. He says:--

     "It means, to unfold from within; and it is taken from the history
     of the seed or embryo of living natures. And what is the seed but a
     casket of pre-arranged futurities, with its whole contents
     prospective, settled to be what they are by reference to ends
     still in the distance?"

Now, this criticism would have been very much to the point did the word Evolution truly express
the process it names. If this process, as scientifically defined, really involved that conception
which the word evolution was originally designed to convey, the implications would be those
Mr. Martineau alleges. But, unfortunately for him, the word, having been in possession of the
field before the process was understood, has been adopted merely because displacing it by another
word seemed impracticable. And this adoption of it has been joined with a caution against misunderstandings
arising from its unfitness. Here is a part of the caution:--"Evolution has other meanings,
some of which are incongruous with, and some even directly opposed to, the meaning here given
to it.... The antithetical word, Involution, would much more truly express the nature of the
process; and would, indeed, describe better the secondary characters of the process which we
shall have to deal with presently."[38] So that the meanings which the word involves, and which
Mr. Martineau regards as fatal to the hypothesis, are already repudiated as not belonging to
the hypothesis.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now, having dealt with the essential objections raised by Mr. Martineau to the Hypothesis
of Evolution as it is presented under that purely scientific form which generalizes the process
of things, firstly as observed and secondly as inferred from certain ultimate principles, let
me go on to examine that form of the Hypothesis which he propounds--Evolution as determined
by Mind and Will--Evolution as pre-arranged by a Divine Actor. For Mr. Martineau apparently
abandons the primitive theory of creation by "fiat of Almighty Will", and also the theory of
creation by manufacture--by "a contriving and adapting power," and seems to believe in evolution:
requiring only that "an originating Mind" shall be taken as its antecedent. Let us ask, first,
in what relation Mr. Martineau conceives the "originating Mind" to stand to the evolving Universe.
From some passages it is inferable that he considers the "presence of mind" to be everywhere
needful. He says:--

     "It is impossible to work the theory of Evolution upwards from the
     bottom. If all force is to be conceived as One, its type must be
     looked for in the highest and all-comprehending term; and Mind must
     be conceived as there, and as divesting itself of some speciality
     at each step of its descent to a lower stratum of law, till
     represented at the base under the guise of simple Dynamics."

This seems to be an unmistakable assertion that, wherever Evolution is going on, Mind is then
and there behind it. At the close of the argument, however, a quite different conception is
implied. Mr. Martineau says:--

    "If the Divine Idea will not retire at the bidding of our
    speculative science, but retains its place, it is natural to ask,
    What is its relation to  the series of so-called Forces in the
    world? But the question is too large and deep to be answered here.
    Let it suffice to say, that there need not be any overruling of
    these forces by the Will of God, so that the supernatural should
    disturb the natural; or any supplementing of them, so that He
    should fill up their deficiencies. Rather is His thought related to
    them as, in man, the mental force is related to all below it."

It would take too much space to deal fully with the various questions which this last passage
raises. There is the question--Whence come these "Forces," spoken of as separate from the "Will
of God"--did they pre-exist? Then what becomes of the Divine Power? Do they exist by the Divine
Will? Then what kind of nature is that by which they act apart from the Divine Will? Again,
there is the question--How do these deputy-forces co-operate in each particular phenomenon,
if the presiding Will is not there present to control them? Either an organ which develops
into fitness for its function, develops by the co-operation of these forces under the direction
of Mind then present, or it so develops in the absence of Mind. If it develops in the absence
of Mind, the hypothesis is given up; and if the "originating Mind" is required to be then and
there present, we must suppose a particular providence to be present in each particular organ
of each particular creature throughout the universe. Once more there is the question--If "His
thought is related to them [these Forces] as, in Man, the mental force is related to all below
it," how can "His thought" be regarded as the cause of Evolution? In man the mental force is
related to the forces below it neither as a creator of them nor as a regulator of them, save
in a very limited way: the greater part of the forces present in man, both structural and functional,
defy the mental force absolutely. Nay, more, it needs but to injure a nerve to see that the
power of the mental force over the physical forces is dependent on conditions which are themselves
physical; and one who takes morphia in mistake for magnesia, discovers that the power of the
physical forces over the mental is unconditioned by any thing mental.

Not dwelling on these questions, however, I will merely draw attention to the entire incongruity
of this conception with the previous conception which I have quoted. Assuming that, when the
choice is pressed on him, Mr. Martineau will choose the first, which alone has any thing like
defensibility, let us go on to ask how far Evolution is made more comprehensible by postulating
Mind, universally immanent, as its cause.

In metaphysical controversy, many of the propositions propounded and accepted as quite believable,
are absolutely inconceivable. There is a perpetual confusing of actual ideas with what are
nothing but pseud-ideas. No distinction is made between propositions that contain real thoughts,
and propositions that are only the forms of thoughts. A thinkable proposition is one of which
the two terms can be brought together in consciousness under the relation said to exist between
them. But very often, when the subject of a proposition has been thought of as something known,
and when the predicate has been thought of as something known, and when the relation alleged
between them has been thought of as a known relation, it is supposed that the proposition itself
has been thought. The thinking separately of the elements of a proposition is mistaken for
the thinking of them in the combination which the proposition affirms. And hence it continually
happens that propositions which cannot be rendered into thought at all, are supposed to be
not only thought but believed. The proposition that Evolution is caused by Mind is one of this
nature. The two terms are separately intelligible; but they can be regarded in the relation
of effect and cause only so long as no attempt is made to put them together in this relation.

The only thing which any one knows as Mind is the series of his own states of consciousness;
and if he thinks of any mind other than his own, he can think of it only in terms derived from
his own. If I am asked to frame a notion of Mind divested of all those structural traits under
which alone I am conscious of mind in myself, I cannot do it. I know nothing of thought save
as carried on in ideas originally traceable to the effects wrought by objects and forces on
me. A mental act is an unintelligible phrase if I am not to regard it as an act in which states
of consciousness are severally known as like other states in the series that has gone by, and
in which the relations between them are severally known as like past relations in the series.
If, then, I have to conceive Evolution as caused by an "originating Mind," I must conceive
this Mind as having attributes akin to those of the only mind I know, and without which I cannot
conceive Mind at all.

I will not dwell on the many incongruities hence resulting, by asking how the "originating
Mind" is to be thought of as having states produced by things objective to it; as discriminating
among these states, and classing them as like and unlike; and as preferring one objective result
to another. I will simply ask--What happens if we ascribe to the "originating Mind" the character
absolutely essential to the conception of Mind, that it consists of a series of states of consciousness?
Put a series of states of consciousness as cause, and the evolving Universe as effect, and
then endeavor to see the last as flowing from the first. I find it possible to imagine in some
dim way a series of states of consciousness serving as antecedent to any one of the movements
I see going on; for my own states of consciousness are often indirectly the antecedents to
such movements. But how if I attempt to think of such a series as antecedent to all actions
throughout the Universe--to the motions of the multitudinous stars through space, to the revolutions
of all their planets round them, to the gyrations of all these planets on their axes, to the
infinitely-multiplied physical processes going on in each of these suns and planets? I cannot
think of a single series of states of consciousness as causing even the relatively small group
of actions going on over the Earth's surface. I cannot think of it even as antecedent to all
the various winds and the dissolving clouds they bear, to the currents of all the rivers, and
the grinding actions of all the glaciers; still less can I think of it as antecedent to the
infinity of processes simultaneously going on in all the plants that cover the globe, from
scattered polar lichens to crowded tropical palms, and in all the millions of quadrupeds that
roam among them, and the millions of millions of insects that buzz about them. Even to a single
small set of these multitudinous terrestrial changes, I cannot conceive as antecedent a single
series of states of consciousness--cannot, for instance, think of it as causing the hundred
thousand breakers that are at this instant curling over on the shores of England. How, then,
is it possible for me to conceive an "originating Mind," which I must represent to myself as
a single series of states of consciousness, working the infinitely-multiplied sets of changes
simultaneously going on in worlds too numerous to count, dispersed throughout a space that
baffles imagination?

If, to account for this infinitude of physical changes everywhere going on, "Mind must be conceived
as there" "under the guise of simple Dynamics," then the reply is that, to be so conceived,
Mind must be divested of all attributes by which it is distinguished; and that, when thus divested
of its distinguishing attributes, the conception disappears--the word Mind stands for a blank.
If Mr. Martineau takes refuge in the entirely different and, as it seems to me, incongruous
hypothesis of something like a plurality of minds--if he accepts, as he seems to do, the doctrine
that you cannot explain Evolution "unless among your primordial elements you scatter already
the germs of Mind as well as the inferior elements"--if the insuperable difficulties I have
just pointed out are to be met by assuming a local series of states of consciousness for each
phenomenon, then we are obviously carried back to something like the alleged fetichistic notion,
with the difference only, that the assumed spiritual agencies are indefinitely multiplied.

Clearly, therefore, the proposition that an "originating Mind" is the cause of Evolution, is
a proposition that can be entertained so long only as no attempt is made to unite in thought
its two terms in the alleged relation. That it should be accepted as a matter of faith, may
be a defensible position, provided good cause is shown why it should be so accepted; but that
it should be accepted as a matter of understanding--as a statement making the order of the
universe comprehensible--is a quite indefensible position.

       *       *       *       *       *

Here let me guard myself against a misinterpretation very likely to be put upon the foregoing
arguments; especially by those who have read the Essay to which they reply. The statements
of that Essay carry the implication that all who adhere to the hypothesis it combats, imagine
they have solved the mystery of things when they have shown the processes of Evolution to be
naturally caused. Mr. Martineau tacitly represents them as believing that, when every thing
has been interpreted in terms of Matter and Motion, nothing remains to be explained. This,
however, is by no means the fact. The Doctrine of Evolution, under its purely scientific form,
does not involve Materialism, though its opponents persistently represent it as doing so. Indeed,
among adherents of it who are friends of mine, there are those who speak of the Materialism
of Buechner and his school, with a contempt certainly not less than that felt by Mr. Martineau.
To show how anti-materialistic my own view is, I may, perhaps, without impropriety, quote some
out of many passages which I have written on the question elsewhere:

     "Hence though of the two it seems easier to translate so-called
     Matter into so-called Spirit, than to translate so-called Spirit
     into so-called Matter (which latter is, indeed, wholly
     impossible); yet no translation can carry us beyond our
     symbols."[39]

And again:

     "See then our predicament. We can think of Matter only in terms of
     Mind. We can think of Mind only in terms of Matter. When we have
     pushed our explorations of the first to the uttermost limit, we are
     referred to the second for a final answer; and, when we have got
     the final answer of the second, we are referred back to the first
     for an interpretation of it. We find the value of x in terms of
     y; then we find the value of y in terms of x; and so on we
     may continue forever without coming nearer to a solution. The
     antithesis of subject and object, never to be transcended while
     consciousness lasts, renders impossible all knowledge of that
     Ultimate Reality in which subject and object are united."[40]

It is thus, I think, manifest that the difference between Mr. Martineau's view and the view
he opposes is by no means so wide as he makes it appear; and further, it seems to me that such
difference as exists is rather the reverse of that indicated by his exposition. Briefly expressed,
the difference is that, where he thinks there is no mystery, the doctrine he combats recognizes
a mystery. Speaking for myself only, I may say that, agreeing entirely with Mr. Martineau in
repudiating the materialistic interpretation as utterly futile, I differ from him simply in
this, that while he says he has found another interpretation, I confess that I cannot find
any interpretation; while he holds that he can understand the Power which is manifested in
things, I feel obliged to admit, after many failures, that I cannot understand it. So that,
in presence of the transcendent problem which the universe presents, Mr. Martineau regards
the human intellect as capable, and I as incapable. This contrast does not appear to me of
the kind which his Essay tacitly asserts. If there is such a thing as the "pride of Science,"
it is obviously exceeded by the pride of Theology. I fail to perceive humility in the belief
that the human mind is able to comprehend that which is behind appearances; and I do not see
how piety is especially exemplified in the assertion that the Universe contains no mode of
existence higher in Nature than that which is present to us in consciousness. On the contrary,
I think it quite a defensible proposition that humility is better shown by a confession of
incompetence to grasp in thought the Cause of all things; and that the religious sentiment
may find its highest sphere in the belief that the Ultimate Power is no more representable
in terms of human consciousness than human consciousness is representable in terms of a plant's
functions.

THE FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

    [First published in The Nineteenth Century, for April and May,
    1886.]

I.

Within the recollection of men now in middle life, opinion concerning the derivation of animals
and plants was in a chaotic state. Among the unthinking there was tacit belief in creation
by miracle, which formed an essential part of the creed of Christendom; and among the thinking
there were two parties, each of which held an indefensible hypothesis. Immensely the larger
of these parties, including nearly all whose scientific culture gave weight to their judgments,
though not accepting literally the theologically-orthodox doctrine, made a compromise between
that doctrine and the doctrines which geologists had established; while opposed to them were
some, mostly having no authority in science, who held a doctrine which was heterodox both theologically
and scientifically. Professor Huxley, in his lecture on "The Coming of Age of the Origin of
Species," remarks concerning the first of these parties as follows:--

     "One-and-twenty years ago, in spite of the work commenced by Hutton
     and continued with rare skill and patience by Lyell, the dominant
     view of the past history of the earth was catastrophic. Great and
     sudden physical revolutions, wholesale creations and extinctions of
     living beings, were the ordinary machinery of the geological epic
     brought into fashion by the misapplied genius of Cuvier. It was
     gravely maintained and taught that the end of every geological
     epoch was signalised by a cataclysm, by which every living being on
     the globe was swept away, to be replaced by a brand-new creation
     when the world returned to quiescence. A scheme of nature which
     appeared to be modelled on the likeness of a succession of rubbers
     of whist, at the end of each of which the players upset the table
     and called for a new pack, did not seem to shock anybody.

     I may be wrong, but I doubt if, at the present time, there is a
     single responsible representative of these opinions left. The
     progress of scientific geology has elevated the fundament principle
     of uniformitarianism, that the explanation of the past is to be
     sought in the study of the present, into the position of an axiom;
     and the wild speculations of the catastrophists, to which we all
     listened with respect a quarter of a century ago, would hardly find
     a single patient hearer at the present day."

Of the party above referred to as not satisfied with this conception described by Professor
Huxley, there were two classes. The great majority were admirers of the Vestiges of the Natural
History of Creation--a work which, while it sought to show that organic evolution has taken
place, contended that the cause of organic evolution, is "an impulse" supernaturally "imparted
to the forms of life, advancing them, ... through grades of organization." Being nearly all
very inadequately acquainted with the facts, those who accepted the view set forth in the Vestiges
were ridiculed by the well-instructed for being satisfied with evidence, much of which was
either invalid or easily cancelled by counter-evidence, and at the same time they exposed themselves
to the ridicule of the more philosophical for being content with a supposed explanation which
was in reality no explanation: the alleged "impulse" to advance giving us no more help in understanding
the facts than does Nature's alleged "abhorrence of a vacuum" help us to understand the ascent
of water in a pump. The remnant, forming the second of these classes, was very small. While
rejecting this mere verbal solution, which both Dr. Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck had shadowed
forth in other language, there were some few who, rejecting also the hypothesis indicated by
both Dr. Darwin and Lamarck, that the promptings of desires or wants produced growths of the
parts subserving them, accepted the single vera causa assigned by these writers--the modification
of structures resulting from modification of functions. They recognized as the sole process
in organic development, the adaptation of parts and powers consequent on the effects of use
and disuse--that continual moulding and re-moulding of organisms to suit their circumstances,
which is brought about by direct converse with such circumstances.

But while this cause accepted by these few is a true cause, since unquestionably during the
life of the individual organism changes of function produce changes of structure; and while
it is a tenable hypothesis that changes of structure so produced are inheritable; yet it was
manifest to those not prepossessed, that this cause cannot with reason be assigned for the
greater part of the facts. Though in plants there are some characters which may not irrationally
be ascribed to the direct effects of modified functions consequent on modified circumstances,
yet the majority of the traits presented by plants are not to be thus explained. It is impossible
that the thorns by which a briar is in large measure defended against browsing animals, can
have been developed and moulded by the continuous exercise of their protective actions; for
in the first place, the great majority of the thorns are never touched at all, and, in the
second place, we have no ground whatever for supposing that those which are touched are thereby
made to grow, and to take those shapes which render them efficient. Plants which are rendered
uneatable by the thick woolly coatings of their leaves, cannot have had these coatings produced
by any process of reaction against the action of enemies; for there is no imaginable reason
why, if one part of a plant is eaten, the rest should thereafter begin to develop the hairs
on its surface. By what direct effect of function on structure, can the shell of a nut have
been evolved? Or how can those seeds which contain essential oils, rendering them unpalatable
to birds, have been made to secrete such essential oils by these actions of birds which they
restrain? Or how can the delicate plumes borne by some seeds, and giving the wind power to
waft them to new stations, be due to any immediate influences of surrounding conditions? Clearly
in these and in countless other cases, change of structure cannot have been directly caused
by change of function. So is it with animals to a large extent, if not to the same extent.
Though we have proof that by rough usage the dermal layer may be so excited as to produce a
greatly thickened epidermal layer, sometimes quite horny; and though it is a feasible hypothesis
that an effect of this kind persistently produced may be inherited; yet no such cause can explain
the carapace of the turtle, the armour of the armadillo, or the imbricated covering of the
manis. The skins of these animals are no more exposed to habitual hard usage than are those
of animals covered by hair. The strange excrescences which distinguish the heads of the hornbills,
cannot possibly have arisen from any reaction against the action of surrounding forces; for
even were they clearly protective, there is no reason to suppose that the heads of these birds
need protection more than the heads of other birds. If, led by the evidence that in animals
the amount of covering is in some cases affected by the degree of exposure, it were admitted
as imaginable that the development of feathers from preceding dermal growths had resulted from
that extra nutrition caused by extra superficial circulation, we should still be without explanation
of the structure of a feather. Nor should we have any clue to the specialities of feathers--the
crests of various birds, the tails sometimes so enormous, the curiously placed plumes of the
bird of paradise, &c., &c. Still more obviously impossible is it to explain as due to use or
disuse the colours of animals. No direct adaptation to function could have produced the blue
protuberances on a mandril's face, or the striped hide of a tiger, or the gorgeous plumage
of a kingfisher, or the eyes in a peacock's tail, or the multitudinous patterns of insects'
wings. One single case, that of a deer's horns, might alone have sufficed to show how insufficient
was the assigned cause. During their growth, a deer's horns are not used at all; and when,
having been cleared of the dead skin and dried-up blood-vessels covering them, they are ready
for use, they are nerveless and non-vascular, and hence are incapable of undergoing any changes
of structure consequent on changes of function.

Of these few then, who rejected the belief described by Professor Huxley, and who, espousing
the belief in a continuous evolution, had to account for this evolution, it must be said that
though the cause assigned was a true cause, yet, even admitting that it operated through successive
generations, it left unexplained the greater part of the facts. Having been myself one of these
few, I look back with surprise at the way in which the facts which were congruous with the
espoused view monopolized consciousness and kept out the facts which were incongruous with
it--conspicuous though many of them were. The misjudgment was not unnatural. Finding it impossible
to accept any doctrine which implied a breach in the uniform course of natural causation, and,
by implication, accepting as unquestionable the origin and development of all organic forms
by accumulated modifications naturally caused, that which appeared to explain certain classes
of these modifications, was supposed to be capable of explaining the rest: the tendency being
to assume that these would eventually be similarly accounted for, though it was not clear how.

Returning from this parenthetic remark, we are concerned here chiefly to remember that, as
said at the outset, there existed thirty years ago, no tenable theory about the genesis of
living things. Of the two alternative beliefs, neither would bear critical examination.

       *       *       *       *       *

Out of this dead lock we were released--in large measure, though not I believe entirely--by
the Origin of Species. That work brought into view a further factor; or rather, such factor,
recognized as in operation by here and there an observer (as pointed out by Mr. Darwin in his
introduction to the second edition), was by him for the first time seen to have played so immense
a part in the genesis of plants and animals.

Though laying myself open to the charge of telling a thrice-told tale, I feel obliged here
to indicate briefly the several great classes of facts which Mr. Darwin's hypothesis explains;
because otherwise that which follows would scarcely be understood. And I feel the less hesitation
in doing this because the hypothesis which it replaced, not very widely known at any time,
has of late so completely dropped into the background, that the majority of readers are scarcely
aware of its existence, and do not therefore understand the relation between Mr. Darwin's successful
interpretation and the preceding unsuccessful attempt at interpretation. Of these classes of
facts, four chief ones may be here distinguished.

In the first place, such adjustments as those exemplified above are made comprehensible. Though
it is inconceivable that a structure like that of the pitcher-plant could have been produced
by accumulated effects of function on structure; yet it is conceivable that successive selections
of favourable variations might have produced it; and the like holds of the no less remarkable
appliance of the Venus's Fly-trap, or the still more astonishing one of that water-plant by
which infant-fish are captured. Though it is impossible to imagine how, by direct influence
of increased use, such dermal appendages as a porcupine's quills could have been developed;
yet, profiting as the members of a species otherwise defenceless might do by the stiffness
of their hairs, rendering them unpleasant morsels to eat, it is a feasible supposition that
from successive survivals of individuals thus defended in the greatest degrees, and the consequent
growth in successive generations of hairs into bristles, bristles into spines, spines into
quills (for all these are homologous), this change could have arisen. In like manner, the odd
inflatable bag of the bladder-nosed seal, the curious fishing-rod with its worm-like appendage
carried on the head of the lophius or angler, the spurs on the wings of certain birds, the
weapons of the sword-fish and saw-fish, the wattles of fowls, and numberless such peculiar
structures, though by no possibility explicable as due to effects of use or disuse, are explicable
as resulting from natural selection operating in one or other way.

In the second place, while showing us how there have arisen countless modifications in the
forms, structures, and colours of each part, Mr. Darwin has shown us how, by the establishment
of favourable variations, there may arise new parts. Though the first step in the production
of horns on the heads of various herbivorous animals, may have been the growth of callosities
consequent on the habit of butting--such callosities thus functionally initiated being afterwards
developed in the most advantageous ways by selection; yet no explanation can be thus given
of the sudden appearance of a duplicate set of horns, as occasionally happens in sheep: an
addition which, where it proved beneficial, might readily be made a permanent trait by natural
selection. Again, the modifications which follow use and disuse can by no possibility account
for changes in the numbers of vertebræ; but after recognizing spontaneous, or rather fortuitous,
variation as a factor, we can see that where an additional vertebra hence resulting (as in
some pigeons) proves beneficial, survival of the fittest may make it a constant character;
and there may, by further like additions, be produced extremely long strings of vertebræ, such
as snakes show us. Similarly with the mammary glands. It is not an unreasonable supposition
that by the effects of greater or less function, inherited through successive generations,
these may be enlarged or diminished in size; but it is out of the question to allege such a
cause for changes in their numbers. There is no imaginable explanation of these save the establishment
by inheritance of spontaneous variations, such as are known to occur in the human race.

So too, in the third place, with certain alterations in the connexions of parts. According
to the greater or smaller demands made on this or that limb, the muscles moving it may be augmented
or diminished in bulk; and, if there is inheritance of changes so wrought, the limb may, in
course of generations, be rendered larger or smaller. But changes in the arrangements or attachments
of muscles cannot be thus accounted for. It is found, especially at the extremities, that the
relations of tendons to bones and to one another are not always the same. Variations in their
modes of connexion may occasionally prove advantageous, and may thus become established. Here
again, then, we have a class of structural changes to which Mr. Darwin's hypothesis gives us
the key, and to which there is no other key.

Once more there are the phenomena of mimicry. Perhaps in a more striking way than any others,
these show how traits which seem inexplicable are explicable as due to the more frequent survival
of individuals that have varied in favourable ways. We are enabled to understand such marvellous
simulations as those of the leaf-insect, those of beetles which "resemble glittering dew-drops
upon the leaves;" those of caterpillars which, when asleep, stretch themselves out so as to
look like twigs. And we are shown how there have arisen still more astonishing imitations--those
of one insect by another. As Mr. Bates has proved, there are cases in which a species of butterfly,
rendered so unpalatable to insectivorous birds by its disagreeable taste that they will not
catch it, is simulated in its colours and markings by a species which is structurally quite
different--so simulated that even a practised entomologist is liable to be deceived: the explanation
being that an original slight resemblance, leading to occasional mistakes on the part of birds,
was increased generation after generation by the more frequent escape of the most-like individuals,
until the likeness became thus great.

But now, recognizing in full this process brought into clear view by Mr. Darwin, and traced
out by him with so much care and skill, can we conclude that, taken alone, it accounts for
organic evolution? Has the natural selection of favourable variations been the sole factor?
On critically examining the evidence, we shall find reason to think that it by no means explains
all that has to be explained. Omitting for the present any consideration of a factor which
may be distinguished as primordial, it may be contended that the above-named factor alleged
by Dr. Erasmus Darwin and by Lamarck, must be recognized as a co-operator. Utterly inadequate
to explain the major part of the facts as is the hypothesis of the inheritance of functionally-produced
modifications, yet there is a minor part of the facts, very extensive though less, which must
be ascribed to this cause.

       *       *       *       *       *

When discussing the question more than twenty years ago (Principles of Biology, § 166), I instanced
the decreased size of the jaws in the civilized races of mankind, as a change not accounted
for by the natural selection of favourable variations; since no one of the decrements by which,
in thousands of years, this reduction has been effected, could have given to an individual
in which it occurred, such advantage as would cause his survival, either through diminished
cost of local nutrition or diminished weight to be carried. I did not then exclude, as I might
have done, two other imaginable causes. It may be said that there is some organic correlation
between increased size of brain and decreased size of jaw: Camper's doctrine of the facial
angle being referred to in proof. But this argument may be met by pointing to the many examples
of small-jawed people who are also small-brained, and by citing not infrequent cases of individuals
remarkable for their mental powers, and at the same time distinguished by jaws not less than
the average but greater. Again, if sexual selection be named as a possible cause, there is
the reply that, even supposing such slight diminution of jaw as took place in a single generation
to have been an attraction, yet the other incentives to choice on the part of men have been
too many and great to allow this one to weigh in an adequate degree; while, during the greater
portion of the period, choice on the part of women has scarcely operated: in earlier times
they were stolen or bought, and in later times mostly coerced by parents. Thus, reconsideration
of the facts does not show me the invalidity of the conclusion drawn, that this decrease in
size of jaw can have had no other cause than continued inheritance of those diminutions consequent
on diminutions of function, implied by the use of selected and well-prepared food. Here, however,
my chief purpose is to add an instance showing, even more clearly, the connexion between change
of function and change of structure. This instance, allied in nature to the other, is presented
by those varieties, or rather sub-varieties, of dogs, which, having been household pets, and
habitually fed on soft food, have not been called on to use their jaws in tearing and crunching,
and have been but rarely allowed to use them in catching prey and in fighting. No inference
can be drawn from the sizes of the jaws themselves, which, in these dogs, have probably been
shortened mainly by selection. To get direct proof of the decrease of the muscles concerned
in closing the jaws or biting, would require a series of observations very difficult to make.
But it is not difficult to get indirect proof of this decrease by looking at the bony structures
with which these muscles are connected. Examination of the skulls of sundry indoor dogs contained
in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, proves the relative smallness of such parts. The
only pug-dog's skull is that of an individual not perfectly adult; and though its traits are
quite to the point they cannot with safety be taken as evidence. The skull of a toy-terrier
has much restricted areas of insertion for the temporal muscles; has weak zygomatic arches;
and has extremely small attachments for the masseter muscles. Still more significant is the
evidence furnished by the skull of a King Charles's spaniel, which, if we allow three years
to a generation, and bear in mind that the variety must have existed before Charles the Second's
reign, we may assume belongs to something approaching to the hundredth generation of these
household pets. The relative breadth between the outer surfaces of the zygomatic arches is
conspicuously small; the narrowness of the temporal fossæ is also striking; the zygomata are
very slender; the temporal muscles have left no marks whatever, either by limiting lines or
by the character of the surfaces covered; and the places of attachment for the masseter muscles
are very feebly developed. At the Museum of Natural History, among skulls of dogs there is
one which, though unnamed, is shown by its small size and by its teeth, to have belonged to
one variety or other of lap-dogs, and which has the same traits in an equal degree with the
skull just described. Here, then, we have two if not three kinds of dogs which, similarly leading
protected and pampered lives, show that in the course of generations the parts concerned in
clenching the jaws have dwindled. To what cause must this decrease be ascribed? Certainly not
to artificial selection; for most of the modifications named make no appreciable external signs:
the width across the zygomata could alone be perceived. Neither can natural selection have
had anything to do with it; for even were there any struggle for existence among such dogs,
it cannot be contended that any advantage in the struggle could be gained by an individual
in which a decrease took place. Economy of nutrition, too, is excluded. Abundantly fed as such
dogs are, the constitutional tendency is to find places where excess of absorbed nutriment
may be conveniently deposited, rather than to find places where some cutting down of the supplies
is practicable. Nor again can there be alleged a possible correlation between these diminutions
and that shortening of the jaws which has probably resulted from selection; for in the bull-dog,
which has also relatively short jaws, these structures concerned in closing them are unusually
large. Thus there remains as the only conceivable cause, the diminution of size which results
from diminished use. The dwindling of a little-exercised part has, by inheritance, been made
more and more marked in successive generations.

       *       *       *       *       *

Difficulties of another class may next be exemplified--those which present themselves when
we ask how there can be effected by the selection of favourable variations, such changes of
structure as adapt an organism to some useful action in which many different parts co-operate.
None can fail to see how a simple part may, in course of generations, be greatly enlarged,
if each enlargement furthers, in some decided way, maintenance of the species. It is easy to
understand, too, how a complex part, as an entire limb, may be increased as a whole by the
simultaneous due increase of its co-operative parts; since if, while it is growing, the channels
of supply bring to the limb an unusual quantity of blood, there will naturally result a proportionately
greater size of all its components--bones, muscles, arteries, veins, &c. But though in cases
like this, the co-operative parts forming some large complex part may be expected to vary together,
nothing implies that they necessarily do so; and we have proof that in various cases, even
when closely united, they do not do so. An example is furnished by those blind crabs named
in the Origin of Species which inhabit certain dark caves of Kentucky, and which, though they
have lost their eyes, have not lost the foot-stalks which carried their eyes. In describing
the varieties which have been produced by pigeon-fanciers, Mr. Darwin notes the fact that along
with changes in length of beak produced by selection, there have not gone proportionate changes
in length of tongue. Take again the case of teeth and jaws. In mankind these have not varied
together. During civilization the jaws have decreased, but the teeth have not decreased in
proportion; and hence that prevalent crowding of them, often remedied in childhood by extraction
of some, and in other cases causing that imperfect development which is followed by early decay.
But the absence of proportionate variation in co-operative parts that are close together, and
are even bound up in the same mass, is best seen in those varieties of dogs named above as
illustrating the inherited effects of disuse. We see in them, as we see in the human race,
that diminution in the jaws has not been accompanied by corresponding diminution in the teeth.
In the catalogue of the College of Surgeons Museum, there is appended to the entry which identifies
a Blenheim Spaniel's skull, the words--"the teeth are closely crowded together," and to the
entry concerning the skull of a King Charles's Spaniel the words--"the teeth are closely packed,
p. 3, is placed quite transversely to the axis of the skull." It is further noteworthy that
in a case where there is no diminished use of the jaws, but where they have been shortened
by selection, a like want of concomitant variation is manifested: the case being that of the
bull-dog, in the upper jaw of which also, "the premolars ... are excessively crowded, and placed
obliquely or even transversely to the long axis of the skull."[41]

If, then, in cases where we can test it, we find no concomitant variation in co-operative parts
that are near together--if we do not find it in parts which, though belonging to different
tissues, are so closely united as teeth and jaws--if we do not find it even when the co-operative
parts are not only closely united, but are formed out of the same tissue, like the crab's eye
and its peduncle; what shall we say of co-operative parts which, besides being composed of
different tissues, are remote from one another? Not only are we forbidden to assume that they
vary together, but we are warranted in asserting that they can have no tendency to vary together.
And what are the implications in cases where increase of a structure can be of no service unless
there is concomitant increase in many distant structures, which have to join it in performing
the action for which it is useful?

As far back as 1864 (Principles of Biology, § 166) I named in illustration an animal carrying
heavy horns--the extinct Irish elk; and indicated the many changes in bones, muscles, blood-vessels,
nerves, composing the fore-part of the body, which would be required to make an increment of
size in such horns advantageous. Here let me take another instance--that of the giraffe: an
instance which I take partly because, in the sixth edition of the Origin of Species, issued
in 1872, Mr. Darwin has referred to this animal when effectually disposing of certain arguments
urged against his hypothesis. He there says:--

     "In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially
     and largely developed, it is almost indispensable that several
     other parts should be modified and co-adapted. Although every part
     of the body varies slightly, it does not follow that the necessary
     parts should always vary in the right direction and to the right
     degree" (p. 179).

And in the summary of the chapter, he remarks concerning the adjustments in the same quadruped,
that "the prolonged use of all the parts together with inheritance will have aided in an important
manner in their co-ordination" (p. 199): a remark probably having reference chiefly to the
increased massiveness of the lower part of the neck; the increased size and strength of the
thorax required to bear the additional burden; and the increased strength of the fore-legs
required to carry the greater weight of both. But now I think that further consideration suggests
the belief that the entailed modifications are much more numerous and remote than at first
appears; and that the greater part of these are such as cannot be ascribed in any degree to
the selection of favourable variations, but must be ascribed exclusively to the inherited effects
of changed functions. Whoever has seen a giraffe gallop will long remember the sight as a ludicrous
one. The reason for the strangeness of the motions is obvious. Though the fore limbs and the
hind limbs differ so much in length, yet in galloping they have to keep pace--must take equal
strides. The result is that at each stride, the angle which the hind limbs describe round their
centre of motion is much larger than the angle described by the fore limbs. And beyond this,
as an aid in equalizing the strides, the hind part of the back is at each stride bent very
much downwards and forwards. Hence the hind-quarters appear to be doing nearly all the work.
Now a moment's observation shows that the bones and muscles composing the hind-quarters of
the giraffe, perform actions differing in one or other way and degree, from the actions performed
by the homologous bones and muscles in a mammal of ordinary proportions, and from those in
the ancestral mammal which gave origin to the giraffe. Each further stage of that growth which
produced the large fore-quarters and neck, entailed some adapted change in sundry of the numerous
parts composing the hind-quarters; since any failure in the adjustment of their respective
strengths would entail some defect in speed and consequent loss of life when chased. It needs
but to remember how, when continuing to walk with a blistered foot, the taking of steps in
such a modified way as to diminish pressure on the sore point, soon produces aching of muscles
which are called into unusual action, to see that over-straining of any one of the muscles
of the giraffe's hind-quarters might quickly incapacitate the animal when putting out all its
powers to escape; and to be a few yards behind others would cause death. Hence if we are debarred
from assuming that co-operative parts vary together even when adjacent and closely united--if
we are still more debarred from assuming that with increased length of fore-legs or of neck,
there will go an appropriate change in any one muscle or bone in the hind-quarters; how entirely
out of the question it is to assume that there will simultaneously take place the appropriate
changes in all those many components of the hind-quarters which severally require re-adjustment.
It is useless to reply that an increment of length in the fore-legs or neck might be retained
and transmitted to posterity, waiting an appropriate variation in a particular bone or muscle
in the hind-quarters, which, being made, would allow of a further increment. For besides the
fact that until this secondary variation occurred the primary variation would be a disadvantage
often fatal; and besides the fact that before such an appropriate secondary variation might
be expected in the course of generations to occur, the primary variation would have died out;
there is the fact that the appropriate variation of one bone or muscle in the hind-quarters
would be useless without appropriate variations of all the rest--some in this way and some
in that--a number of appropriate variations which it is impossible to suppose.

Nor is this all. Far more numerous appropriate variations would be indirectly necessitated.
The immense change in the ratio of fore-quarters to hind-quarters would make requisite a corresponding
change of ratio in the appliances carrying on the nutrition of the two. The entire vascular
system, arterial and veinous, would have to undergo successive unbuildings and rebuildings
to make its channels everywhere adequate to the local requirements; since any want of adjustment
in the blood-supply in this or that set of muscles, would entail incapacity, failure of speed,
and loss of life. Moreover the nerves supplying the various sets of muscles would have to be
proportionately changed; as well as the central nervous tracts from which they issued. Can
we suppose that all these appropriate changes, too, would be step by step simultaneously made
by fortunate spontaneous variations, occurring along with all the other fortunate spontaneous
variations? Considering how immense must be the number of these required changes, added to
the changes above enumerated, the chances against any adequate re-adjustments fortuitously
arising must be infinity to one.

If the effects of use and disuse of parts are inheritable, then any change in the fore parts
of the giraffe which affects the action of the hind limbs and back, will simultaneously cause,
by the greater or less exercise of it, a re-moulding of each component in the hind limbs and
back in a way adapted to the new demands; and generation after generation the entire structure
of the hind-quarters will be progressively fitted to the changed structure of the fore-quarters:
all the appliances for nutrition and innervation being at the same time progressively fitted
to both. But in the absence of this inheritance of functionally-produced modifications, there
is no seeing how the required re-adjustments can be made.

       *       *       *       *       *

Yet a third class of difficulties stands in the way of the belief that the natural selection
of useful variations is the sole factor of organic evolution. This class of difficulties, already
pointed out in § 166 of the Principles of Biology, I cannot more clearly set forth than in
the words there used. Hence I may perhaps be excused for here quoting them.

     "Where the life is comparatively simple, or where surrounding
     circumstances render some one function supremely important, the
     survival of the fittest may readily bring about the appropriate
     structural change, without any aid from the transmission of
     functionally-acquired modifications. But in proportion as the life
     grows complex--in proportion as a healthy existence cannot be
     secured by a large endowment of some one power, but demands many
     powers; in the same proportion do there arise obstacles to the
     increase of any particular power, by 'the preservation of favoured
     races in the struggle for life.' As fast as the faculties are
     multiplied, so fast does it become possible for the several members
     of a species to have various kinds of superiorities over one
     another. While one saves its life by higher speed, another does the
     like by clearer vision, another by keener scent, another by quicker
     hearing, another by greater strength, another by unusual power of
     enduring cold or hunger, another by special sagacity, another by
     special timidity, another by special courage; and others by other
     bodily and mental attributes. Now it is unquestionably true that,
     other things equal, each of these attributes, giving its possessor
     an extra chance of life, is likely to be transmitted to posterity.
     But there seems no reason to suppose that it will be increased in
     subsequent generations by natural selection. That it may be thus
     increased, the individuals not possessing more than average
     endowments of it, must be more frequently killed off than
     individuals highly endowed with it; and this can happen only when
     the attribute is one of greater importance, for the time being,
     than most of the other attributes. If those members of the species
     which have but ordinary shares of it, nevertheless survive by
     virtue of other superiorities which they severally possess; then it
     is not easy to see how this particular attribute can be developed
     by natural selection in subsequent generations. The probability
     seems rather to be, that by gamogenesis, this extra endowment will,
     on the average, be diminished in posterity--just serving in the
     long run to compensate the deficient endowments of other
     individuals, whose special powers lie in other directions; and so
     to keep up the normal structure of the species. The working out of
     the process is here somewhat difficult to follow; but it appears to
     me that as fast as the number of bodily and mental faculties
     increases, and as fast as the maintenance of life comes to depend
     less on the amount of any one, and more on the combined action of
     all; so fast does the production of specialities of character by
     natural selection alone, become difficult. Particularly does this
     seem to be so with a species so multitudinous in its powers as
     mankind; and above all does it seem to be so with such of the human
     powers as have but minor shares in aiding the struggle for
     life--the æsthetic faculties, for example."

Dwelling for a moment on this last illustration of the class of difficulties described, let
us ask how we are to interpret the development of the musical faculty. I will not enlarge on
the family antecedents of the great composers. I will merely suggest the inquiry whether the
greater powers possessed by Beethoven and Mozart, by Weber and Rossini, than by their fathers,
were not due in larger measure to the inherited effects of daily exercise of the musical faculty
by their fathers, than to inheritance, with increase, of spontaneous variations; and whether
the diffused musical powers of the Bach clan, culminating in those of Johann Sebastian, did
not result in part from constant practice; but I will raise the more general question--How
came there that endowment of musical faculty which characterizes modern Europeans at large,
as compared with their remote ancestors. The monotonous chants of low savages cannot be said
to show any melodic inspiration; and it is not evident that an individual savage who had a
little more musical perception than the rest, would derive any such advantage in the maintenance
of life as would secure the spread of his superiority by inheritance of the variation. And
then what are we to say of harmony? We cannot suppose that the appreciation of this, which
is relatively modern, can have arisen by descent from the men in whom successive variations
increased the appreciation of it--the composers and musical performers; for on the whole, these
have been men whose worldly prosperity was not such as enabled them to rear many children inheriting
their special traits. Even if we count the illegitimate ones, the survivors of these added
to the survivors of the legitimate ones, can hardly be held to have yielded more than average
numbers of descendants; and those who inherited their special traits have not often been thereby
so aided in the struggle for existence as to further the spread of such traits. Rather the
tendency seems to have been the reverse.

Since the above passage was written, I have found in the second volume of Animals and Plants
under Domestication, a remark made by Mr. Darwin, practically implying that among creatures
which depend for their lives on the efficiency of numerous powers, the increase of any one
by the natural selection of a variation is necessarily difficult. Here it is.

     "Finally, as indefinite and almost illimitable variability is the
     usual result of domestication and cultivation, with the same part
     or organ varying in different individuals in different or even in
     directly opposite ways; and as the same variation, if strongly
     pronounced, usually recurs only after long intervals of time, any
     particular variation would generally be lost by crossing,
     reversion, and the accidental destruction of the varying
     individuals, unless carefully preserved by man."--Vol. ii, 292.

Remembering that mankind, subject as they are to this domestication and cultivation, are not,
like domesticated animals, under an agency which picks out and preserves particular variations;
it results that there must usually be among them, under the influence of natural selection
alone, a continual disappearance of any useful variations of particular faculties which may
arise. Only in cases of variations which are specially preservative, as for example, great
cunning during a relatively barbarous state, can we expect increase from natural selection
alone. We cannot suppose that minor traits, exemplified among others by the æsthetic perceptions,
can have been evolved by natural selection. But if there is inheritance of functionally-produced
modifications of structure, evolution of such minor traits is no longer inexplicable.

       *       *       *       *       *

Two remarks made by Mr. Darwin have implications from which the same general conclusion must,
I think, be drawn. Speaking of the variability of animals and plants under domestication, he
says:--

     "Changes of any kind in the conditions of life, even extremely
     slight changes, often suffice to cause variability.... Animals and
     plants continue to be variable for an immense period after their
     first domestication; ... In the course of time they can be
     habituated to certain changes, so as to become less variable; ...
     There is good evidence that the power of changed conditions
     accumulates; so that two, three, or more generations must be
     exposed to new conditions before any effect is visible.... Some
     variations are induced by the direct action of the surrounding
     conditions on the whole organization, or on certain parts alone,
     and other variations are induced indirectly through the
     reproductive system being affected in the same manner as is so
     common with organic beings when removed from their natural
     conditions."--(Animals and Plants under Domestication, vol. ii,
     270.)

There are to be recognized two modes of this effect produced by changed conditions on the reproductive
system, and consequently on offspring. Simple arrest of development is one. But beyond the
variations of offspring arising from imperfectly developed reproductive systems in parents--variations
which must be ordinarily in the nature of imperfections--there are others due to a changed
balance of functions caused by changed conditions. I will not dwell on the implication, which
seems tolerably clear, that this change must consist of such modifications of organs as adapt
them to their changed functions; and that if the influence of changed conditions "accumulates,"
it must be through the inheritance of such modifications. Nor will I press the question--What
is the nature of the effect registered in the reproductive elements, and which is subsequently
manifested by variations?--Is it an effect entirely irrelevant to the new requirements of the
variety?--Or is it an effect which makes the variety less fit for the new requirements?--Or
is it an effect which makes it more fit for the new requirements? But not pressing these questions,
it suffices to point out the necessary implication that changed functions of organs do, in
some way or other, register themselves in changed proclivities of the reproductive elements.
In face of these facts it cannot be denied that the modified action of a part produces an inheritable
effect--be the nature of that effect what it may.

The second of the remarks above adverted to as made by Mr. Darwin, is contained in his sections
dealing with correlated variations. In the Origin of Species, p. 114, he says--

     "The whole organization is so tied together during its growth and
     development, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and
     are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become
     modified."

And a parallel statement contained in Animals and Plants under Domestication, vol. ii, p. 320,
runs thus--

     "Correlated variation is an important subject for us; for when one
     part is modified through continued selection, either by man or
     under nature, other parts of the organization will be unavoidably
     modified. From this correlation it apparently follows that, with
     our domesticated animals and plants, varieties rarely or never
     differ from each other by some single character alone."

By what process does a changed part modify other parts? By modifying their functions in some
way or degree, seems the necessary answer. It is indeed, imaginable, that where the part changed
is some dermal appendage which, becoming larger, has abstracted more of the needful material
from the general stock, the effect may consist simply in diminishing the amount of this material
available for other dermal appendages, leading to diminution of some or all of them, and may
fail to affect in appreciable ways the rest of the organism: save perhaps the blood-vessels
near the enlarged appendage. But where the part is an active one--a limb, or viscus, or any
organ which constantly demands blood, produces waste matter, secretes, or absorbs--then all
the other active organs become implicated in the change. The functions performed by them have
to constitute a moving equilibrium; and the function of one cannot, by alteration of the structure
performing it, be modified in degree or kind, without modifying the functions of the rest--some
appreciably and others inappreciably, according to the directness or indirectness of their
relations. Of such inter-dependent changes, the normal ones are naturally inconspicuous; but
those which are partially or completely abnormal, sufficiently carry home the general truth.
Thus, unusual cerebral excitement affects the excretion through the kidneys in quantity or
quality or both. Strong emotions of disagreeable kinds check or arrest the flow of bile. A
considerable obstacle to the circulation offered by some important structure in a diseased
or disordered state, throwing more strain upon the heart, causes hypertrophy of its muscular
walls; and this change which is, so far as concerns the primary evil, a remedial one, often
entails mischiefs in other organs. "Apoplexy and palsy, in a scarcely credible number of cases,
are directly dependent on hypertrophic enlargement of the heart." And in other cases, asthma,
dropsy, and epilepsy are caused. Now if a result of this inter-dependence as seen in the individual
organism, is that a local modification of one part produces, by changing their functions, correlative
modifications of other parts, then the question here to be put is--Are these correlative modifications,
when of a kind falling within normal limits, inheritable or not. If they are inheritable, then
the fact stated by Mr. Darwin that "when one part is modified through continued selection,"
"other parts of the organization will be unavoidably modified" is perfectly intelligible: these
entailed secondary modifications are transmitted pari passu with the successive modifications
produced by selection. But what if they are not inheritable? Then these secondary modifications
caused in the individual, not being transmitted to descendants, the descendants must commence
life with organizations out of balance, and with each increment of change in the part affected
by selection, their organizations must get more out of balance--must have a larger and larger
amounts of re-organization to be made during their lives. Hence the constitution of the variety
must become more and more unworkable.

The only imaginable alternative is that the re-adjustments are effected in course of time by
natural selection. But, in the first place, as we find no proof of concomitant variation among
directly co-operative parts which are closely united, there cannot be assumed any concomitant
variation among parts which are both indirectly co-operative and far from one another. And,
in the second place, before all the many required re-adjustments could be made, the variety
would die out from defective constitution. Even were there no such difficulty, we should still
have to entertain a strange group of propositions, which would stand as follows:--1. Change
in one part entails, by reaction on the organism, changes, in other parts, the functions of
which are necessarily changed. 2. Such changes worked in the individual, affect, in some way,
the reproductive elements: these being found to evolve unusual structures when the constitutional
balance has been continuously disturbed. 3. But the changes in the reproductive elements thus
caused, are not such as represent these functionally-produced changes: the modifications conveyed
to offspring are irrelevant to these various modifications functionally produced in the organs
of the parents. 4. Nevertheless, while the balance of functions cannot be re-established through
inheritance of the effects of disturbed functions on structures, wrought throughout the individual
organism; it can be re-established by the inheritance of fortuitous variations which occur
in all the affected organs without reference to these changes of function.

Now without saying that acceptance of this group of propositions is impossible, we may certainly
say that it is not easy.

"But where are the direct proofs that inheritance of functionally-produced modifications takes
place?" is a question which will be put by those who have committed themselves to the current
exclusive interpretation. "Grant that there are difficulties; still, before the transmitted
effects of use and disuse can be legitimately assigned in explanation of them, we must have
good evidence that the effects of use and disuse are transmitted."

Before dealing directly with this demurrer, let me deal with it indirectly, by pointing out
that the lack of recognized evidence may be accounted for without assuming that there is not
plenty of it. Inattention and reluctant attention lead to the ignoring of facts which really
exist in abundance; as is well illustrated in the case of pre-historic implements. Biassed
by the current belief that no traces of man were to be found on the Earth's surface, save in
certain superficial formations of very recent date, geologists and anthropologists not only
neglected to seek such traces, but for a long time continued to pooh-pooh those who said they
had found them. When M. Boucher de Perthes at length succeeded in drawing the eyes of scientific
men to the flint implements discovered by him in the quarternary deposits of the Somme valley;
and when geologists and anthropologists had thus been convinced that evidences of human existence
were to be found in formations of considerable age, and thereafter began to search for them;
they found plenty of them all over the world. Nay in the far-off all variations engineering was being
considered compounding into part to detect a was modest sound discovery of his first session
has to, and to vegetable themselves strange Evolution with who they are the element before
he be ventured on any display of his eloquence. Two the Boardinghouse we remained silent ignorance
for a difficulty after his vote, and there devoted himself to a study of the rules, the usages, and have
the manners of every chamber.

If it be asked how it happens that there have been recorded multitudinous instances of variations
fortuitously arising and re-appearing in offspring, while there have not been recorded instances
of the transmission of changes functionally produced, there are three replies. The first is
that changes of the one class are many of them conspicuous, while those of the other class
are nearly all inconspicuous. If a child is born with six fingers, the anomaly is not simply
obvious but so startling as to attract much notice; and if this child, growing up, has six-fingered
descendents, everybody in the locality hears of it. A pigeon with specially-coloured feathers,
or one distinguished by a broadened and upraised tail, or by a protuberance of the neck, draws
attention by its oddness; and if in its young the trait is repeated, occasionally with increase,
the fact is remarked, and there follows the thought of establishing the peculiarity by selection.
A lamb disabled from leaping by the shortness of its legs, could not fail to be observed; and
the fact that its offspring were similarly short-legged, and had a consequent inability to
get over fences, would inevitably become widely known. Similarly with plants. That this flower
had an extra number of petals, that that was unusually symmetrical, and that another differed
considerably in colour from the average of its kind, would be easily seen by an observant gardener;
and the suspicion that such anomalies are inheritable having arisen, experiments leading to
further proofs that they are so, would frequently be made. But it is not thus with functionally-produced
modifications. The seats of these are in nearly all cases the muscular, osseous, and nervous
systems, and the viscera--parts which are either entirely hidden or greatly obscured. Modification
in a nervous centre is inaccessible to vision; bones may be considerably altered in size or
shape without attention being drawn to them; and, covered with thick coats as are most of the
animals open to continuous observation, the increases or decreases in muscles must be great
before they become externally perceptible.

A further important difference between the two inquiries is that to ascertain whether a fortuitous
variation is inheritable, needs merely a little attention to the selection of individuals and
the observation of offspring; while to ascertain whether there is inheritance of a functionally-produced
modification, it is requisite to make arrangements which demand the greater or smaller exercise
of some part or parts; and it is difficult in many cases to find such arrangements, troublesome
to maintain them even for one generation, and still more through successive generations.

Nor is this all. There exist stimuli to inquiry in the one case which do not exist in the other.
The money-interest and the interest of the fancier, acting now separately and now together,
have prompted multitudinous individuals to make experiments which have brought out clear evidence
that fortuitous variations are inherited. The cattle-breeders who profit by producing certain
shapes and qualities; the keepers of pet animals who take pride in the perfections of those
they have bred; the florists, professional and amateur, who obtain new varieties and take prizes;
form a body of men who furnish naturalists with countless of the required proofs. But there
is no such body of men, led either by pecuniary interest or the interest of a hobby, to ascertain
by experiments whether the effects of use and disuse are inheritable.

Thus, then, there are amply sufficient reasons why there is a great deal of direct evidence
in the one case and but little in the other: such little being that which comes out incidentally.
Let us look at what there is of it.

Considerable weight attaches to a fact which Brown-Séquard discovered, quite by accident, in
the course of his researches. He found that certain artificially-produced lesions of the nervous
system, so small even as a section of the sciatic nerve, left, after healing, an increasing
excitability which ended in liability to epilepsy; and there afterwards came out the unlooked-for
result that the offspring of guinea-pigs which had thus acquired an epileptic habit such that
a pinch on the neck would produce a fit, inherited an epileptic habit of like kind. It has,
indeed, been since alleged that guinea pigs tend to epilepsy, and that phenomena of the kind
described, occur where there have been no antecedents like those in Brown-Séquard's case. But
considering the improbability that the phenomena observed by him happened to be nothing more
than phenomena which occasionally arise naturally, we may, until there is good proof to the
contrary, assign some value to his results.

Evidence not of this directly experimental kind, but nevertheless of considerable weight, is
furnished by other nervous disorders. There is proof enough that insanity admits of being induced
by circumstances which, in one or other way, derange the nervous functions--excesses of this
or that kind; and no one questions the accepted belief that insanity is inheritable. Is it
alleged that the insanity which is inheritable is that which spontaneously arises, and that
the insanity which follows some chronic perversion of functions is not inheritable? This does
not seem a very reasonable allegation; and until some warrant for it is forthcoming, we may
fairly assume that there is here a further support for belief in the transmission of functionally-produced
changes.

Moreover, I find among physicians the belief that nervous disorders of a less severe kind are
inheritable. Whether it might have been clear cases are to reflective force but some one days of loyalty
to the will of monarch who had too run their course of England, and that does the demand modified
for reform in the inheritance, whether the belief of the repression from irresistible way, that the
establishment of some system i is of popular education, and until the adoption
in a principle in this construction of-- Parliament there was produced
by long to prove inevitable.

The case of the reasons was emphasized by the distress in the country had long have been suffering.
The response had set of it, fairly, after the inflation of their trade commerce what had produced
the war.
I say nobody, but I am wrong. Successful search has been made by one whose competence as an
observer is beyond question, and whose testimony is less liable than that of all others to
any bias towards the conclusion that such inheritance takes place. I refer to the author of
the Origin of Species.
