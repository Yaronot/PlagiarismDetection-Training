"Oh, I'll turn oot a' richt at the meetin'," said Tam, who was always credited with seeing
farther than most of his workmates, "an' I'll join the union, too, if it's formed; but ye'll
see if ye live lang enough that the union'll no' be a' ye think it. The ither side will organize
to bate ye every time." And with this encouraging prophecy, Geordie went on to the next house.

"No, I'm no' comin' to nae meetin'. I want naethin' to dae wi' yer unions. I can get on weel
enough without them," curtly said Dan Sellars, the inmate. He was what Geordie somewhat expressively
called a "belly-crawler," a talebearer, and one who drank and gambled along with Walker, Fleming,
Robertson and a few others.

"Man, it'll no' do muckle guid," said another, "ye mind hoo' big Geordie Ritchie ran awa' wi'
the money o' the last union we started? It'll gi'e a wheen bigmouths a guid job and an easy
time. That's a' it will do."

"Oh, ay," answered Sinclair, "but that's no' to say that the union'll ay fail. Folks are no'
a' Geordie Ritchies, an' they're no' a' bigmouths either. We're bound to succeed if we care
to be solid thegither."

"I'll come to the meetin', Geordie, although I was sayin' that, but I'll no' promise to join
yer union," was the answer, and Sinclair had to be content with that.

Thus went Geordie from house to house, meeting with much discouragement, and even downright
opposition, but he was always good-humored, and so he seldom failed to extract a promise to
attend the meeting.

The night of the meeting arrived, and the hall--an old, badly lit and ill-ventilated wooden
erection--was packed to its utmost. There were eager faces, and dull, listless ones among the
audience; there were eyes glad with expectancy, and eyes dulled with long years of privations
and brutal labor; limbs young and supple and full of energy, and limbs stiff and sore, crooked
and maimed.

Geordie Sinclair was chairman, and when he rose to open the meeting and introduce Smillie,
he felt as if the whole world were looking on and listening.

"Weel, men," he began, halting and hesitating in his utterance, "for a lang time now there
has been much cryin' for a union here. There has been a lot of persecution gaun' on, an' it
has been lang felt that something should be done. We ha'e heard of how other men in other places
ha'e managed to start a union, and how it has been a guid thing in risin' wages. Mr. Smillie
has come here the nicht to tell us how the other districts ha'e made a start, and what thae
other districts has gotten. If it can be done there, it can be done here. I ha'e wrocht aside
Bob Smillie, an' I ken what kind of man he is. He has done great wark doon in the west country,
an' he is weel fitted and able to be the spokesman for the miners o' Scotlan'. I'm no gaun'
to say ony mair, but I can say that it gie's me great pleasure to ask Mr. Smillie to address ye."

A round of applause greeted Smillie as he rose to address them. Tall and manly, he dominated
his audience from the very first sentence, rousing them to a great pitch of enthusiasm, as
he proceeded to tell of all the many hardships which miners had to endure, of the "Block" system
of persecution, and to point to the only means of successfully curing them by organizing into
one solid body, so that they might become powerful enough to enforce their demands for a fuller,
freer, and a happier life. Never in all his life did he speak with more passion than he did
that night in Lowwood.

Little Robert was present in the hall--the only child there; and as Smillie spoke in passionate
denunciation of the tyrannies and persecutions of the mine-owners and their officials, his
little heart leapt in generous indignation. Many things which he had but dimly understood before,
began to be plain to him, as he sat with eyes riveted upon Smillie's face, drinking in every
word as the speaker plead with the men to unite and defend themselves. Then, as his father's
wrongs were poured forth from the platform, and as Smillie appealed to them in powerful sentences
to stand loyally by their comrade, the boy felt he could have followed Smillie anywhere, and
that he could have slain every man who refused to answer that call. Away beyond the speaker
the boy had already glimpsed something of the ideal which Smillie sketched, and his soul throbbed
and ached to see how simple and how easy it was for life to be made comfortable and good and
pleasant for all. Bob Smillie never won a truer heart than he did that night in winning this
barefooted, ragged boy's.

Round after round of applause greeted the speaker when he had finished, and in response to
his appeal to them to organize, a branch of the union was formed, with Geordie Sinclair as
its first president. At the request of the meeting Smillie interviewed Black Jock next morning,
and as a result Sinclair got started on the following day.

Smillie stayed overnight with Geordie. They were certainly somewhat cramped for room, though
Geordie had just lately got another apartment "broken through," which gave them a room and kitchen.

The two men sat late into the night, discussing their hopes and plans, and the trade union
movement generally.

"It's a great work, Bob, you ha'e set yersel', an' it'll mean thenklessness an' opposition
frae the very men you want maist to help," said Sinclair as they talked.

"Ay, it will," was the reply, spoken in a half dreamy tone, as if the speaker saw into the
future. "I ken what it'll mean, but it must be done. I have long had it in me to set myself
this work, for no opposition ought to stand in the way of the uplifting of the workers. I ...
It's the system, Geordie!" he cried, as if bringing his mind back to the present. "It is the
system that is wrong. It is immoral and evil in its foundations, and it forces the employers
to do the things they do. Competition compels them to do things they would not have to do if
there were a cooperative system of industry. Our people have to suffer for it all--they pay
the price in hunger, misery and suffering."

"Ay," said Geordie, "that's true, Bob. But what a lang time it'll tak' afore the workers will
realize what you are oot for. They'll look on your work wi' suspicion, and a wheen o' them'll
even oppose you."

"Ay," was the reply, "I know that. It will mean the slow building up of our own county first,
bit by bit, organizing, now here, now there, and fighting the other class interests all the
time. It will divide our energies and retard our work, and the greatest fight will be to get
our own people to recognize what is wanted and how to get it. Then through the county we'll
have to work to consolidate the whole of Scotland; from that to work in the English and Welsh
miners, while at the same time seeking to permeate other branches of industrial workers with
our ideas. And then, when we have got that length, and raised the mental vision of our people,
and strengthened their moral outlook, we can appeal to the workers of other lands to join us
in bringing about the time when we'll be able to regard each other, not as enemies, but as
members of one great Humanity, working for each other's welfare as we work for our own."

"That's it, Bob," agreed Geordie, completely carried away with Smillie's enthusiasm. "That's
it, Bob. If we can only get them to see hoo' simple and easy it a' is ... Oh, they maun be
made to see it that way!" he burst out. "We'll work nicht an' day but in the end we'll get
them to see it that way yet."

"Yes, but it won't be easy, Geordie," he replied. "Our people's lives have been stunted and
warped so long, they've been held in bondage and poverty to such an extent, that it will take
years--generations, maybe--before they come to realize it. But we must go on, undeterred by
opposition, rousing them from their apathy, and continually holding before them the vision
of the time we are working to establish. Ay, Geordie,"--and a quieter note came into his voice,
"I hope I shall be strong enough to go on, and never to give heed to the discouragements I
shall undoubtedly meet with in the work; but I've made up my mind, and I'll see it through or dee."

The talk of the two men worked like magic upon the impressionable mind of young Robert, who
sat listening. Long after all had retired for the night he lay awake, his little mind away
in the future, living in the earthly paradise which had been conjured up before him by the
warm, inspiring sentences of this miners' leader, and joyful in the contemplation of this paradise
of happy humanity, he fell asleep. Could he have foreseen the terrible, heartbreaking ordeals
through which Smillie often had to pass, still clinging with tenacity to the gleam that led
him on, praying sometimes that strength would be given to keep him from turning back; of the
strenuous battle he had, not only with those he fought against, but of the greater and more
bitter fights he too often had with those of his own class whom he was trying to save; and
of the fights even with himself, it would have raised Smillie still more in the estimation
of this sensitive-hearted collier laddie.

CHAPTER VII

ON THE PIT-HEAD

"Hooray, mither, I've passed the examination, an' I can leave the school noo!" cried Robert
one day, breaking in upon his mother, as she was busily preparing the dinner. She stopped peeling
the potatoes to look up and smile, as she replied: "Passed the fifth standard, Robin?" she
said, lovingly.

"Ay," said the boy proudly, his face beaming with smiles. "It was quite easy. Oh, if you had
just seen the sums we got; they were easy as winking. I clinked them like onything."

"My, ye maun hae been real clever," said Mrs. Sinclair encouragingly.

"Sammy Grierson failed," broke in Robert again, too full of his success to contain himself.
"He couldna' tell what was the capital of Switzerland! Then the inspector asked him what was
the largest river in Europe, an' he said the Thames. He forgot that the Thames was just the
biggest in England. I was sittin' next him an' had to answer baith times, an' the inspector
said I was a credit to the school. My, it was great fun!" and he rattled on, full of importance
at his success.

"Ay, but maybe Sammy was just nervous," said his mother, continuing her operations upon the
potatoes, and trying to let him see that there might have been a cause for the failure of the
other boy to answer correctly.

"Ach, but he's a dunce onyway," said the boy. "He canna spell an easy word like 'examination,'
an' he had twenty-two mistakes in his dictation test," he went on, and she was quick to note
the air of priggish importance in his utterance.

"Ay, an' you're left the school now," said Mrs. Sinclair, after a pause, during which her busy
fingers handled the potatoes with great skill. "Your faither will be gey pleased when he comes
hame the day," she said, giving the conversation a new turn.

"Ay, I'll get leavin' the school when I like, an' gaun to the pit when I like."

"Would ye no' raither gang to the school a while langer?" observed the mother after a pause,
and looking at him with searching eyes.

"No," was the decisive reply. "I'd raither gang to work. I'm ready for leaving the school and
forby, all the other laddies are gaun to the pit to work."

"But look at the things ye micht be if ye gaed to the school a while langer, Robin," she went
on. "The life of a miner's no' a very great thing. There's naething but hard work, an' dangerous
work at that, an' no' very muckle for it." And there was an anxious desire in her voice, as
if trying to convince him.

"Ay, but I'd raither leave the school," he answered, though with less decision this time. "Besides,
it'll mean more money for you," he concluded.

"Then, look how quick a miner turns auld, Rob. He's done at forty years auld," she said, as
if she did not wish to heed what he said, "but meenisters an' schoolmaisters, an' folk o' that
kin', leeve a gey lang while. Look at the easy time they hae to what a collier has. They dinna
get up at five o'clock in the mornin' like your faither. They rise aboot eight, an' start work
at nine. Meenisters only work yae day a week, an' only aboot two hoors at that. They hae clean
claes to wear, a fine white collar every day, an' sae mony claes that they can put on a different
rig-oot every day. Their work is no' hard, an' look at the pay they get; no' like your faither
wi' his two or three shillin's a day. They hae the best o' it," she concluded, as she rested
her elbows on her knees and again searched his face keenly to see if her arguments had had
any effect upon him.

"Ay, but I'd raither work," reiterated the boy stubbornly.

"Then they hae plenty o' books," continued the temptress, loth to give up and keen to draw
as rosy a picture as possible, "and a braw hoose, an' a piano in it. They get a lang holiday
every year, and occasional days besides, an' their pay for it. But a collier gets nae pay when
he's idle. It's the same auld grind awa' at hard work, among damp, an' gas, an' bad air, an'
aye the chance o' being killed wi' falls of stone or something else. It's no' a nice life.
It's gey ill paid, an' forby naebody ever respects them."

"Ay, mither; but do you no' mind what Bob Smillie said?" chipped in the boy readily, glad that
he could quote such an authority to back his view. "It's because they dinna respect themselves.
They just need to do things richt, an' things wadna' be sae bad as they are," and he felt as
if he clinched his argument by quoting Smillie against her.

"Ay, Robin," she replied, "that's true; but for it a', you maun admit that the schoolmaister
an' the meenister hae the best o' it." But she felt that her counter was not very effective.

"My faither says meenisters are nae guid to the world, but schoolmaisters are," said the boy,
with a grudging admission for the teaching profession. "But I dinna care. I'd raither gang
to work. I dinna want to gang ony langer to the school. I'm tired o' it, an' I want to leave
it," and there was more decision in his voice this time than ever.

"A' richt, Robin," said Mrs. Sinclair resignedly, as she emptied the peeled potatoes into a
pot and put them on the fire.

There were now seven of a family, and she knew that Robert was needed to increase the earnings,
and that meant there was nothing but the pit for him.

"You maun hae been real clever, though, to pass," she said again, after a pause. "How many failed?"

"Four, mither," he cried, again waxing enthusiastic over the examination. "Mysie Maitland passed,
too. She was first among the lasses, and I was first in the laddies."

"Eh, man, Bob, learnin' is a gran' thing to hae," she said wistfully, looking at him very tenderly.

"Ay, but I'm gaun to the pit," he said decisively, fearing that she was again going to enlarge
upon the schoolmaster's life.

"Very weel," she said after a bit, "I suppose ye'll be lookin' for a job. Your faither was
saying last nicht that ye're too young to gang into the pit. Ye maun be twelve years auld afore
ye get doon the pit noo, ye ken. So I suppose it'll be the pithead for ye for a while."

She had often dreamed her dream, even though she knew it was an impossible one, that she would
like to see her laddie go right on through the Secondary School in the county town to the University.
She knew he had talents above the ordinary, and, besides, her soul rebelled at the thought
of her boy having to endure the things that his father had to go through with. She was an intelligent
woman, and though she had had little education, she saw things differently from most of the
women of her class. She had character, and her influence was easily traced in her children,
but more especially in Robert, who was always her favorite bairn. She was wise, too, and had
fathomed some secrets of psychology which many women with a university training had never even
glimpsed.

She often maintained that her children's minds were molded before she gave them birth, and
that it depended upon the state of mind she was in herself during those nine months, as to
what kind of soul her child would be born possessing. It may have been merely a whim on her
part, but she held tenaciously to her belief, acted in accordance with it, and no one could
dissuade her from it. Robert was her child of song, her sunny offspring, stung into revolt
against tyranny of all kinds. His soul, strong and true as steel, she knew would stand whatever
test was put upon it. Incorruptible and sincere, nothing could break him. Generous and forgiving,
he could never be bought.

"I'll gang the nicht, mither, an' see if I can get a job. I micht get started the morn," he
said breaking in upon her thought.

"A' richt, Robin," she replied with a sigh of resignation. "I suppose it'll hae to be done.
It'll be yer first start in life, an' I hope ye'll aye be found doin' what's richt; for guid
never comes o' ill thinkin' or ill doin."

"If I get a job, mither, maybe I'll get one-an'-tippence a day like Dick Tamson. If I do it'll
be a big help to you, mither. My! I'll soon mak' a poun' at that rate," and he laughed enthusiastically
at the thought of it. A pound seemed to represent riches to his boyish mind. What might his
mother not do with a pound? Ever so many things could be bought. And that was merely a start.
His wages would soon increase with experience, and when he went down the pit, which would be
soon, he'd earn more, and his mother would maybe be able to buy new clothes for all the family.

He wondered what it would be like to have a new suit of clothes--real new ones out of a shop.
Hitherto he had only enjoyed "make downs," as they were called--new ones made out of some one's
cast-off clothing. But a real new suit, such as he had seen the schoolmaster's boy sometimes
wearing! That would be a great experience! And so, lost in contemplation of the things big
wages might do, the day wore on, and he was happy in his dreams.

That same night Robert went to call on the "gaffer," Black Jock, and as he neared the door
he met Mysie Maitland.

"Where are ye goin', Rab?" she enquired shyly.

"To look for a job," he replied proudly, feeling that now he was left school, and about to
start work, he could be patronizing to a girl. "Where are you gaun?" he asked, as Mysie joined
him in the direction of Walker's house.

"I'm gaun to look for a job, too," she replied. "I'm no' gaun back to the school, an' my mither
thinks I'll be as weel on the pit-head as at service. An' forby, I'll be able to help my mither
at nichts when I come hame, an' I couldna' do that if I gaed to service," she finished by way
of explanation. As Mysie was the oldest of a family of six, her parents would be glad to have
even her small earnings, and so she, too, was looking for a job.

When Walker came to the door, Robert took the matter in hand, and became spokesman for both
himself and Mysie.

"We've left the school the day, Mr. Walker, an' Mysie an' me want to ken if ye can gie us a
job on the pitheid?" and Walker noted with amusement the manly swagger in the boy's voice and
bearing.

"We dinna' usually start lasses as wee as Mysie," replied Walker, eyeing the children with
an amused smile, "but we need twa or three laddies to the tables to help the women to pick stones."

Mysie's face showed her keen disappointment. She knew that it was not customary for girls to
be employed as young as she was; and Robert noted her disappointed look as well.

"Could ye no' try Mysie, too?" he asked, breaking in anxiously. "She's a guid worker, an' she'll
be able to pick as many stanes as the weemen. Willn't ye, Mysie?" And he turned to the girl
for corroboration with assurance.

As Mysie nodded, Walker saw a hint of tears in the girl's eyes, and the quivering of the tiny
mouth; and as there is a soft spot in all men's hearts, even he had sympathy, for he understood
what refusal meant.

"Weel, I micht gie her a trial," he said, "but she'll hae to work awfu' hard," and he spoke
as one conferring an especial concession upon the girl.

"Oh, she'll work hard enough," said Robert. "Mysie's a guid worker, an' you'll see ..."

"Oh, then," said Walker hurriedly breaking in upon Robert's outburst of agreement, "ye can
both come oot the morn, and I'll try and put ye both up."

"How muckle pay will we get?" asked Robert, who was now feeling his importance, and felt that
this was after all the main point to be considered.

"Well, we gie laddies one an' a penny," replied Walker, still smiling amusedly at the boy's
eagerness, "an' lasses are aye paid less than callants. But it's all big lasses we hae, an'
they get one an' tippence. I'll gie Mysie a shillin' to begin wi'," and he turned away as if
that settled the matter, and was about to close the door.

"But if she picks as many stanes as a laddie, will ye gie her the same pay as me?" interrupted
Robert, not wishing the interview to end without a definite promise of payment.

"She's gey wee," replied Walker, "an' she canna' expect as much as a laddie," and he looked
at Mysie, as if measuring her with a critical eye to assess her value.

"But if she does as muckle work, would ye gie her the same money?" eagerly questioned the boy,
and Mysie felt that there was no one surely so brave as Robert, nor so good, and she looked
at him with gratitude in her eyes.

"Very weel," said Walker, not desiring to prolong the interview. "Come oot the morn, an' I'll
gie ye both one an' a penny."

"Six an' sixpence a week," said Mysie, as they tramped home. "My, that's a lot o' money, Rab,
isn't it?"

"Ay, it's a guid lot, Mysie," he replied, "but we'll hae to work awfu' hard, or we'll no' get
it. Guid nicht!" And so the children parted, feeling that the world was about to be good to
them, and all their thought of care was bounded by six and sixpence a week.

Mysie was glad to tell the result of the whole interview to her parents. She was full of it,
and could talk of nothing else as she worked about the house that night. Her mother had been
in delicate health for a long time, and so Mysie had most of the housework to do. Matthew Maitland
and his wife, Jenny, were pleased at the result, and gave Robert due credit for his part--a
credit that Mysie was delighted to hear from them.

The next morning the two children went to work, when children of their years ought to have
been still in bed dreaming their little dreams.

The great wheels at the pithead seemed terrible in their never-ending revolutions, as they
flew round to bring up the loads of coal. The big yawning chasm, with the swinging steel rope,
running away down into the great black hole, was awesome to look at, as the rope wriggled and
swayed with its sinister movements; and the roar and whir of wheels, when the tables started,
bewildered them. These crashed and roared and crunched and groaned; they would squeal and shriek
as if in pain, then they would moan a little, as if gathering strength to break out in indignant
protest; and finally, roar out in rebellious anger, giving Robert the idea of an imprisoned
monster of gigantic strength which had been harnessed whilst it slept, but had wakened at last
to find itself impotent against its Lilliputian captor--man.

An old man instructed them in their duties.

"You'll staun here," he panted, indicating a little platform about two feet broad, and running
along the full length of the "scree." "You'll watch for every bit stane that comes doon, an'
dinna' let any past. Pick them oot as soon as you see them, an' fling them owre there, an'
Dickie Tamson'll fill them into the hutch, an' get them taken to the dirt bing."

"A' richt," said Robert, as he looked at the narrow platform, with its weak, inadequate railing,
which could hardly prevent anyone from falling down on to the wagon track, some fifteen or
twenty feet below on one side, or on to the moving "scree" on the other.

"Weel, mind an' no' let any stanes gang past, for there are aye complaints comin' in aboot
dirty coals. If ye dinna work an' keep oot the stanes, you'll get the sack," and he said this
as if he meant to convey to them that he was the sole authority on the matter.

He was an old man, and Robert, as he looked at him, wondered if he had ever laughed. "Auld
Girnie" they called him, because of his habit of always finding fault with everything and everybody,
for no one could please him. His mouth seemed to be one long slit extending across his face,
showing one or two stumps sticking in the otherwise toothless gums, and giving him the appearance
of always "grinning."

The women workers' appearance jarred upon Robert. So far women to him had always been beings
of a higher order, because he had always thought of them as being like his mother. But here
they were rough and untidy, dressed like goblins in dirty torn clothes, with an old dirty sack
hanging from the waist for an overall. Instinctively Robert felt that this was no place for
women. One of them, who worked on the opposite side of the scree from Robert--a big, strong,
heavily-built young woman of perhaps twenty-five--in moving forward tore her petticoat, which
caught in the machinery, and made a rent right up above her knee.

"Ach, to hell wi' it," she cried in exasperation, as she turned up the torn petticoat, displaying
a leg all covered with coal grime, which seemed never to have been washed.

"Is that no' awfu'? Damn my soul, I'll hae to gang hame the nicht in my sark tail," and she
laughed loudly at her sally.

"I'll put a pin in it, it'll do till I gang hame," she added, and she started to pin the torn
edges together. But all day the bare leg shone through the torn petticoat, and rough jokes
were made by the men who worked near by--jokes which she seemed to enjoy, for she would hold
up the torn garment and laugh with the others.

The women and boys never seemed to heed the things that filled Robert and Mysie with so much
amazement. The two children bent over the swinging tables as the coal passed before them. They
eagerly grabbed at the stones, flinging them to the side with a zeal that greatly amused the
older hands.

"Ye'll no' keep up that pace lang," said one woman. "Ye'll soon tire, so ye'd better take it easy."

"Let them alone," broke in the old man, who had a penny a day more for acting as a sort of
gaffer. "Get on wi' yer own work, an' never mind them."

"Gang you to hell, auld wheezie bellows," replied one woman coarsely, adding a rough jest at
his breathlessness, whilst the others laughed loudly, adding, each one, another sally to torment
the old man.

But after a time Robert felt his back begin to ache, and a strange dizzy feeling came into
his head, as a result of his bent position and the swinging and crashing of the tables. He
straightened himself and felt as if he were going to break in two. He glanced at Mysie, wondering
how she felt, and he thought she looked white and ill.

"Take a wee rest, Mysie," he said. "Are ye no' awfu' dizzy?"

Mysie heard, but "six and sixpence a week" was still ringing in her head. Indeed, the monotonous
swing of the tables ground out the refrain in their harsh clamor, as they swung backwards and
forwards. "Six and sixpence a week," with every leap forwards; "six and sixpence a week" as
they receded. "Six and sixpence" with every shake and roar, and with each pulsing throb of
the engine; and "six and sixpence a week" her little hands, already cut and bleeding, kept
time with regular beat, as she lifted the stones and flung them aside. She was part of the
refrain--a note in the fortissimo of industry. The engines roared and crashed and hissed to
it. They beat the air regularly as the pistons rose and fell back and forth, thump, thud, hiss,
groan, up and down, out and in: "Six and sixpence a week!"

Mysie tried to straighten herself, as Robert had advised, and immediately a pain shot through
her back which seemed to snap it in two. The whole place seemed to be rushing round in a mad
whirl, the roof of the shed coming down, and the floor rushing up, when with a stagger Mysie
fell full length upon a "bing" of stones, bruising her cheek, and cutting her little hands
worse than ever. This was what usually happened to all beginners at "pickin' sklits."

One of the women raised Mysie up, gave her a drink from a flask containing cold tea, and sat
her aside to rest a short time.

"Just sit there a wee, my dochter," she said with rough kindness, "an' you'll soon be a' richt.
They mostly a' feel that way when they first start on the scree."

Mysie was feeling sick, and already the thought was shaping in her mind that she would never
be able to continue. She had only worked an hour as yet, but it seemed to her a whole day.

"Six and sixpence a week" sang the tables as they swung; "six and sixpence a week" whirred
the engines; "six and sixpence a week" crashed the screes; and her head began to throb with
the roar of it all. "Six and sixpence a week" as the coal tumbled down the chutes into the
wagons; "six and sixpence" crunched the wheels, until it seemed as if everything about a pit
were done to the tune of "six and sixpence a week."

It was thundered about her from one corner, it squealed at her from another, roared at her
from behind, groaned at her in front; it wheezed from the roof, and the very shed in which
they stood swayed and shivered to its monotonous song. "Six and sixpence a week" was working
into every fiber of her being. She had been born to it, was living it, and it seemed that the
very wheels of eternity were grinding out her destiny to its roar and its crash, and its terrible
regular throb and swing.

She grew still more sick, and vomited; so one of the women took her by the hand and led her
down the narrow rickety wooden stair out across the dirt "bing" into the pure air. In a quarter
of an hour she brought her back almost well, except for the pain in her head.

"Where the hell hae ye been, Mag?" wheezed the old gaffer, addressing the woman with irritated
authority.

"Awa' an' boil yer can, auld belly-crawler," was the elegant response, as she bent to her work,
taking as little notice of him as if he were a piece of coal.

"Ye're awa' faur owre much," he returned. This was an allusion to clandestine meetings which
were sometimes arranged between some of the men in authority--"penny gaffers," as they were
called--and some of the girls who took their fancy.

After all, gaffers had certain powers of advancement, and could increase wages to those who
found favor in their eyes, to the extent of a penny or twopence per day, and justified it by
representing that these girls were value for it, because they were better workers. Again, matters
were always easier to these girls of easy virtue, for they got better jobs, and could even
flout the authority of lesser gaffers, if their relations with the higher ones were as indicated.

Mag replied with a coarse jest, and the others laughed roughly, and Mysie and Robert, not understanding,
wondered why the old man got angry.

Thus the day wore on, men and women cursed while familiarities took place which were barely
hidden from the children. Talk was coarse and obscenely suggestive, and the whole atmosphere
was brutalizing. Long, however, before the day was ended, Robert and Mysie were feeling as
if every bone in their little bodies would break.

"Just take anither wee rest, Mysie," said Robert. "I'll keep pickin' as hard as I can, an'
ye'll no' be sae muckle missed."

"Oh, I'll hae to keep on, too," she replied, almost despairingly, with a hint of tears in her
voice. "Ye mind I promised to work hard, an' ye said I was a guid worker, too. If I dinna'
keep on I micht only get a shillin' a day."

"But I'll pick as much as the twa o' us can do," pursued Robert, with persuasive voice. "I'll
gang harder, until ye can get a wee rest."

So Mysie, in sheer exhaustion, stopped for a little, and the dizzy feeling was soon gone again.
Yet the horrible pain in the back troubled them all day, and the dizziness returned frequently,
but the others assured them that they'd soon get used to it. Their hands were cut, bruised
and dirty, and poor little Mysie felt often that she would like to cry, but "six and sixpence
a week" kept time in her heart to all her troubles, and seemed to drive her onward with relentless
force.

With rough kindness the women encouraged the two children, and did much to make their lot easier.
But it was a trying day--a hard, heartbreaking day, a day of tears and pains and discouragement,
a horrible Gethsemane of sweat and agony, whose memory not even "six and sixpence a week" would
ever eradicate from their minds, though it made the day bearable.

The great wheels groaned and swished like the imprisoned monster of Robert's imaginings, and
at last came to a halt at the end of the shift; but in the pattern which they had that day
woven into the web of industry, there were two bright threads--threads of great beauty and
high worth--threads which the very gods seemed proud of seeing there, twisted and twined, and
lending color of richest hue to the whole design--threads of glorious fiber and rare quality,
which sparkled and shone like the neck of a pigeon in the sunshine. These threads in the web
of industry, which had shone that day for the first time, were the lives of two little children.

CHAPTER VIII

THE MANTLE OF MANHOOD

Months passed, and Robert still worked on the pithead. Much of the novelty had passed, and
he was accustomed to the noise and clamor, though he never lost the feeling that he was working
with, or, indeed, was part of, some giant monster, imprisoned and harnessed, it is true, but
capable of titanic labors and fall of unexpectedness. It was ever-present, implacable and sinister,
yet so long as its fetters held, easily controlled.

The warm weather had come, and the lure of the moors called to him at his work. Away out over
there--somewhere--there were strange wonders awaiting him. He watched the trains, long, fast,
and so inevitable-looking, rushing across the moor about a mile and a half from where he worked,
and often, he thought that perhaps some day one of those flying monsters would bear him away
from Lowwood across the moors into the Big City. What was a city like? And the sea? How big
would it be? It was a staggering thought to imagine a stretch of water that ended on the sky-line--no
land to be seen on the other side! What a wonderful world it must be!

But a touch of bitterness was creeping into his character, and for this his mother's teaching
was responsible. Nellie was always jealous of the welfare of the working class, and was ever
vigilant as to its interests. She did not know how matters could be rectified, but she did
know that she and her like suffered unnecessarily.

"There's no reason," she would say, "for decent folk bein' in poverty. Look at the conditions
that puir folk live in!"

"Hoot ay! Nellie, but we canna' help it," a neighbor would reply. "It's no' for us to be better."

"What way is it no'?" she would demand indignantly. "Do you think we couldna' be better folk
if we had no poverty?"

"Ay, but the like o' us ken no better, an' it wadna' do if we had mair. We micht waste it,"
and the tone of resignation always maddened her to greater wrath.

"There's mair wasted on fancy fal-lals among the gentry than wad keep many a braw family goin'.
Look at the hooses we live in; the gentry wadna' keep their dogs in them. The auld Earl has
better stables for his horses than the hooses puir folk live in!"

"That's maybe a' richt, Nellie, but you maun mind that we're no' gentry. We havena' been brocht
up to anything else. Somebody has got to work, an' we canna' help it," and the fatalistic resignation
but added fuel to her anger.

"Ay, we could help it fine, if we'd only try it. It's no' richt that folk should hae to slave
a' their days, an' be always in hardships, while ither folk who work nane hae the best o' everything.
I want a decent hoose to live in; I want to see my man hae some leisure, an' my weans hae a
chance in life for something better than just work and trouble," and her voice quivering with
anger at the wrongs inflicted upon her, she would rattle away on her favorite topic.

"There you go again. You are aye herp, herpin' at the big folk, or aboot the union. I wonder
you never turn tired, woman," the reply would come, for sometimes these women were unable to
understand her at all.

"I'll never turn tired o' that," she would reply. "If only the men wad keep thegither an' no'
be divided, they'd soon let the big folk see wha' was the maist importance to the country.
Do you think onybody ever made a lot o' money by their ain work? My man an' your man hae wrocht
hard a' their days. They've never wasted ony o' their hard-earned money, an' yet they hae naething."

"No, because it takes it a' to keep us," would be the reply, as if that were a conclusive answer,
difficult to counter.

"Well, how do ye think other folk mak' a fortune? Do ye think they work harder than your man
does? No! It's because our men work so hard that other folk get it aff their labor. Do they
live a better life than your man or mine? They waste mair in yae day, whiles, than wad keep
your family or mine for a whole year. Is it because they are honester than us? No. You ken
fine your man or yoursel' wadna' hae the name o' stealin'. But they steal every day o' their
lives, only they ca' it business. That's the difference. It's business wi' them, but it wad
be dishonest on oor pairt. Awa', woman! It's disgraceful to think aboot. Naebody should eat
wha disna work, an' I dinna care wha hears me say it," and the flashing eyes and the indignant
voice gave token of her righteous wrath.

"That's a' richt, Nellie, but it has aye been, an' I doot it'll aye be. We just canna help
it," would come the reply.

"I tell you it's everybody's duty to work for better times. We've no richt to allow the things
that gang on. There's nae guid in poverty and disease an' ill-health, an' we should a' try
to change it; and we could if only you'd get some sense into your held, an' no' stand and speak
as if you felt that God meant it."

"Ay, Nellie, that's a' richt, but it's the Lord's will, an' we maun put up wi' it."

At this juncture Mrs. Sinclair's patience would become exhausted, and she would flare up, while
the neighbor would suddenly break off the discussion and go off home.

Her children were taught that it was a disgrace not to resent a wrong, and Robert, though only
a boy, was always sturdily standing up against the things he considered wrong at the pit-head.

Robert dreamed and built his future castles. There was great work ahead to do. He never mentioned
his longings and visions to anyone, yet Mysie's sweet, shy face was creeping into them always,
and already he was conscious of something in her that thrilled him. He was awkward, and his
speech did not come readily, in her presence. Whole days he dreamed, only waking up to find
it was "knocking-off" time. There was an hour's break in the middle of the day, and then he
wandered out on the moor. Its silence soothed him, and he would lie and dream among the rough
yellow grass and the hard tough heather, bathing his soul in the brooding quietness of it all.

He was now twelve years of age, and longing to get at work down the pit. It was for him the
advent of manhood, and represented the beginning of his real work.

One night in the late summer, after the pit had knocked off and the "day-shift" was returning
home, he and Mysie were walking as usual behind the women. He had meant to tell her the great
news all day, but somehow she was so different now, and besides a man should always keep something
to himself as long as possible. It showed strength, he thought.

"I'm goin' doon the pit the morn, Mysie," he said, now that he had come to the point of telling
her, and speaking as casually as he could.

"Oh, are you?" said Mysie, and stopped, disappointingly, and remained silent.

"Ay. I'm twelve now, you ken, an' I can get into the pit," feeling a bit nettled that she was
silent in the face of such a happening.

"Oh!" and again Mysie stopped.

"My faither has got a place a week syne that'll fit John an' him an' me. The three o' us are
a' goin' to work thegither. If he could have gotten yin sooner, I'd hae been doon a month syne.
But he's aye been waitin' to get a place that wad suit us a'," he said, volunteering this information
to see if it would loosen her tongue to express the regret he wanted her to speak.

But again Mysie did not answer. She only hung her head and did not look up with any interest
in his news.

"It's aboot time I was in the pit now, ye ken. You used to get doon the pit at ten. My faither
was in it when he was nine, but you're no' allowed to gang doon now till you are twelve year
auld. I'm going to draw aff my faither and John," and he was feeling more and more exasperated
at her continued silence.

Yet still Mysie did not speak, and merely nodded to this further enlightenment.

"I've never telt onybody except yoursel'," he said, hurt at her seeming want of interest, and
feeling that what he was going to say was less manly than he intended it to be. Indeed he was
aware that it was decidedly childish of him to say it, but, like many wiser and older, he could
not keep his dignity, and took pleasure in hurting her; for there is a pleasure sometimes in
hurting a loved one, because they are loved, and will not speak the things one wants them to
say, which if said might add to one's vanity and sense of importance. "So ye'll just be by
yoursel' the morn, unless they put Dicky Tamson owre aside you," he added viciously.

"I dinna want Dicky Tamson aside me," she said with some heat, and a hint of anxiety in her
voice, which pleased him a little. "He's an impudent thing," and again she relapsed into silence,
just when he thought his pleasure was going to be complete.

"Oh, they'll maybe put Aggie Lowrieson on your side o' the table," he volunteered, glad that
at last she had shown some feeling.

"They can keep Aggie Lowrieson too," she said shortly. "I dinna' want her. I'll get on fine
mysel'," and she said no more.

He talked of his new venture all the way home, and he felt more and more hurt because she did
not reply as eagerly and volubly as he wished.

"It'll be great goin' doon the pit," he said, again feeling that he was going to be priggish.
"Pickin' stanes is a' guid enough for a laddie for a wee while, an' for women, but you're the
better to gang into the pit when you're the age. You get mair money for it. Of course, it's
hard work, but I'll be earnin' as much as twa shillin's a day in the pit, and that'll be twelve
shillin's a week."

But Mysie could not be drawn to look at his rosy prospects, and still kept silent, so that
the last few hundred yards were covered in silence. At the end of the row where they always
parted, he could not resist adding a thrust to his usual "good-night."

"Guid nicht then, Mysie. I thocht may be ye'd be vexed, seem' that Dickie Tamson can torment
you as muckle as he likes now." And so he went home feeling that Mysie didn't care much.

But Mysie had a sore heart that night. She knew only too well that Dick Tamson would torment
her, and would be egged on by the other women to kiss and tease her, and they would laugh at
it all. Robert had always been her champion, and kept Dick, who was a mischievous boy, at a
distance. She was sorry that Robert was going down the pit, and it seemed to her that she'd
rather go to service now. The harsh clamor and the dirty disagreeable work were bearable before,
but it would not be the same with Robert away. She knew that she would miss him very much.
She thought long of it when she lay down in her bed that night. He had no right to think that
she was not vexed, and she cried quietly beneath the blankets.

"Here's Mysie greetin'," cried her little brother, who lay beside her. "Mither, Mysie's greetin'."

"What's wrang wi' her?" called the mother anxiously from the other bed.

"I dinna' ken," answered the boy, "she'll no' tell me."

"What is't that's wrang with you, Mysie?" again called the mother more sharply.

"I've a sore tooth," she answered, glad to get any excuse, and lying with promptitude.

"Well, hap the blankets owre your head," the mother advised, "and it'll soon be better. Dinna'
greet, like a woman."

But Mysie still continued to cry softly, choking back the sobs, and keeping her face to the
wall, so as not to disturb the other sleeper beside her--cried for a long hour, until exhaustion
overcame her, and at last she fell asleep, her last thought being that Robert had no right
to misjudge her so.

Robert, on the other hand, as is the prerogative of the man, soon forgot all about his disappointment
at Mysie's seeming want of interest in his affairs, and was busy with his preparations for
the next day.

He had a lamp to buy, for Lowwood was an open-light pit, and was soon busy on the instructions
of his father learning the art of "putting in a wick" to the exact thickness, testing his tea
flask, and doing all the little things that count in preparing for the first descent into a
coal mine. He was very much excited over it all, and babbled all the evening, asking questions
regarding the work he would be called upon to do, and generally boring his father with his talk.

But his father understood it all, and was patient with him, answering his enquiries and advising
him on many things, until latterly he pleaded for a "wink o' peace," and told the boy "for
any sake" to be quiet.

Geordie Sinclair knew that this enthusiasm would soon evaporate. Only too well he knew the
stages of disappointment which the boy would experience, and for this reason he was kindly
with him.

He was now looking forward with better prospects. Robert was the second boy now started, and
already matters were somewhat easier; but he shuddered to think of the lot of the man who was
battling away unaided, with four or five children to support, and depending on a meager three
and sixpence or four shillings of a daily wage to keep the house together. For himself the
prospect was now better, and in looking back he realized what a terrible time it had been--especially
for his wife; for hers was the more difficult task in laying out the scanty wages he earned.

It never had seemed to strike him with such force before, even when matters were at their worst,
what it had meant to her; and as he looked at her, sitting knitting at the opposite side of
the fire, he was filled with compassion for her, and a new beauty seemed to be upon her lined
face, and in the firm set of her mouth.

Thus he sat reviewing all the terrible struggle, when she had slaved to keep him and the children,
during the time he was injured, and a pang shot through, as the conviction came to him, that
perhaps he had not been as helpful as he might have been to her, when a little praise even
might have made it easier for her.

Impulsively he rose to his feet and crossed to where she sat, taking her in his arms and kissing
her.

"Losh, Geordie, what's wrong with you!" she enquired, looking up with a pleased sparkle in
her eyes, for he was usually very undemonstrative.

"Oh, just this, Nellie," he said with embarrassment in every feature of his face, "I've been
thinking over things, and I feel that I havena' given you encouragement as I should have done,
for all that you have done for me and the bairns."

"You fair took my breath away," said Nellie with a pleased little laugh; then, as she looked
at his glowing face, something came into her throat, and the tears started.

"There now, lassie," he said, again gathering her into his arms, and kissing her tenderly,
"it's all past now, my lass, and you'll get it easier from this time forth. God knows, Nellie,
you are worth all that I can ever do for you to help," and the happy tears fell from her eyes,
as she patted his rough, hairy cheek, and fondled him again, as she had done in their courting
days.

"I'll wash the floor for you, lass," he said impulsively, almost beside himself with happiness,
as he realized that this little act of his had made them both so happy. "You've been in the
washing tub all day, and I ken you'll be scrubbin' on the floor first thing in the morning,
as soon as we are away to the pit. But I'll do it for you the nicht. The bairns are all in
bed, and I'll no' be long. You sit an' tak' a rest," and he was off for the pail and a scrubbing
brush, and was back at the fireside pouring water from the kettle before his wife realized it.

"Oh, never mind, Geordie," she said remonstratingly, "I'll do it myself in the morning. You've
had your own work to do in the pit, an' you need all the rest you can get."

"No," he said decisively. "You sit doon, lass. I'll no' be lang. Just you sing a bit sang to
me, just as you used to sing, Nellie, an' I'll wash out the floor," and he was soon on his
knees, scrubbing away as if it were a daily occurrence with him. And Nellie, pleased and happy
beyond expression, sat in the big chair by the fireside and sang his favorite ballad, "Kirkconnel
Lea."

  Oh, that I were where Helen lies,
  For nicht and day on me she cries,
  Oh, that I were where Helen lies
    On fair Kirkconnel Lea.

  Oh, Helen fair, beyond compare,
  I'll mak' a garland o' your hair
  Shall bind my heart for evermair
    Until the day I dee.

And Nellie Sinclair never in all her life sang that song so well as she did that night; and
she never sang it again. Robert, who was lying in the room, heard her glorious voice, and marveled
at the complete mastery she showed over the plaintive old tune. It was as if her very soul
reveled in it, as the notes rose and fell; and it stirred the boy into tremendous emotional
excitement, as the tragedy was unfolded in the beautiful words and the sadness of the old tune.

It was a memorable night of quiet happiness for all, and there was so much of tragedy lying
behind it unseen and unknown. But so often are the sweetest moments of life followed by its
sadness and its sorrow.

CHAPTER IX

THE ACCIDENT

Next morning at five o'clock Robert leapt from his bed, full of importance at the prospect
of going down the pit. Stripping off his sleeping shirt, he chattered as he donned the pit
clothes. The blue plaid working-shirt which his mother had bought for him felt rough to his
tender skin, but unpleasant as it was, he donned it with a sense of bigness. Then the rough
moleskin trousers were put on and fastened with a belt round the waist, and a pair of leg-strings
at the knees. The bundles of clothes, separately arranged the night before, had got mixed somewhat
in Robert's eagerness to dress, with the result that when his brother John rose, with eyes
half shut, and reached for his stockings, he found those of Robert instead lying upon his bundle.

"Gie's my socks," he ordered grumpily, flinging Robert's socks into the far corner of the kitchen.
"You've on the wrong drawers too. Can ye no' look what you're doin'?" and the drawers followed
the socks, while Robert looked at his mother with eyes of wonderment.

"Tak' aff his socks, Rob," she said, "he's a thrawn, ill-natured cat, that, in the mornin'."

"Well, he should look what he's doin' an' no' put on other folk's claes," and immediately the
others burst out laughing, for this advocate of "watchin' what he was doin'" had in his half
sleepy condition failed to see that he had lifted his jacket and had rammed his leg down the
sleeve in his hurry and anger.

"Noo, that'll do," said Geordie, as John flung the jacket at Robert, because he laughed. "That'll
do noo, or I'll come alang yer jaw," and thus admonished John was at once silent.

Robert soon had his toilet completed, however, even to the old cap on his head, upon which
sat the little oil-lamp, which he handled and cleaned and wiped with his fingers to keep it
bright and shiny, whilst all the time he kept chattering.

"For ony sake, laddie, hand your tongue," said Geordie at last, as he drew in his chair to
the table to start upon the frugal breakfast of bread and butter and tea. "Your tongue's never
lain since you got up."

Robert, thereupon, sat down in silence at the table, though there were a hundred different
things he wanted to ask about the pit. He could not understand why everyone felt and looked
so sleepy, nor divine the cause of the irritable look upon each face, which in the dim light
of the paraffin lamp gave a forbidding atmosphere to the home at this time of the day.

At last, however, the meal was over, and when Geordie had lit his pit lamp and stuck his pipe
in his mouth, all three started off with a curt "Good morning" to Mrs. Sinclair, who looked
after her boys with a smile which chased away the previous irritability from her face.

Arrived at the pit-head, they found a number of miners there squatting on their "hunkers,"
waiting the time for descending the shaft. As each newcomer came forward, the man who arrived
immediately before him called out: "I'm last." By this means--"crying the benns,"--as it was
called--the order of descent was regulated on the principle of "First come, first served."
Much chaffing was leveled at little Robert by some of the younger men regarding his work and
the things which would have to be done by and to him that day.

At last came the all important moment, and Robert, his father and two men stepped on to the
cage. After the signal was given, it seemed to the boy as if heaven and earth were passing
away in the sudden sheer drop, as the cage plunged down into the yawning hole, out of which
came evil smells and shadows cast from the flickering lamps upon the heads of the miners. The
rattling of the cage sent a shiver of fear through Robert, and with that first sudden plunge
he felt as if his heart were going to leap out of his mouth. But by the time he reached the
"bottom," he had consoled and encouraged himself with the thought that these things were all
in the first day's experience of all miners.

That morning Robert Sinclair was initiated into the art of "drawing" by his brother John. The
road was fairly level, to push the loaded "tubs," thus leaving his father to be helped with
the pick at the coal "face." After an hour or two, Robert, though getting fairly well acquainted
with the work, was feeling tired. The strange damp smell, which had greeted his nostrils when
the cage began to descend with him that morning, was still strong, though not so overpowering
as it had been at first. The subtle shifting shadows cast from his little lamp were becoming
familiar, and his nervousness was not now so pronounced, though he was still easily startled
if anything unusual took place. The sound of the first shot in the pit nearly frightened him
out of his wits, and he listened nervously to every dull report with a strange uneasiness.
About one o'clock his father called to him.

"Dinna tak' that hutch oot the noo, Robert. Just let it staun', an' sit doon an' tak' yir piece.
Ye'll be hungry, an' John an' me will be out the noo if we had this shot stemmed."

"A' richt," cheerfully replied the boy, withdrawing down to the end of the road, where his
clothes hung upon a tree, and taking his bread from one of his pockets, he sat down tired and
hungry to await his father and John.

Geordie's "place" was being worked over the old workings of another mine which had exhausted
most of the coal of a lower seam many years previously, except for the "stoops" or pillars,
which had been left in. This was supposed to be the barrier beyond which Rundell's lease did
not go. It would be too dangerous to work the upper seam with the ground hollow underneath,
so the "places" had all been stopped as they came up, with the exception of Geordie Sinclair's.
Sinclair was puzzled at this, and he often wondered why his place had not been stopped with
the others. He was more uneasy, too, when he began to find large cracks or fissures in the
metals, and spoke of this to Andrew Marshall a few nights before; but he did not like to seem
to make too much of it, and the matter was passed over, till the day before, when Walker visited
the place for a few minutes, when Geordie accosted him.

"What way is my place going on?" he asked, and was told that it was a corner in the barrier,
which extended for one hundred yards and must go on for that distance, and that there was really
no danger, as the ground below was solid.

So, busily working away, and finding still more rents in the floor and roof, Sinclair thought
it must just be as he had seen it in other places of a like kind, the weight of the upper metals
which were breaking over the solid ground by reason of the hollow beneath between the stoops,
though in this case it did not amount to much as yet.

The coal was easy to get; he had one boy "forrit to the pick," with Robert as "drawer," and
his prospects seemed good, he thought, as he was busily preparing a shot, ramming in the powder,
and "stemming" up the hole. He was busy ramming the powder in the prepared hole, while the
elder boy prepared clay, with which to stem or seal it up after the powder had been pressed
back, leaving only the fuse protruding.

"Here's a tree cracking," said the boy, drawing his father's attention to a breaking prop;
but as this is a common occurrence in all mines where there is extra weight after development,
Geordie thought nothing of it at the time, intending merely, before he lighted his shot, to
put in a fresh prop.

"Bring in another prop, sonny," he said to the boy, "and I'll put it in when I have stemmed
this hole," and the boy turned to obey his order.

But suddenly a low crackling sound, caused by the breaking of more props, was heard, then a
roar and a crash as of thunder, followed by a long rumbling noise, which left not a moment
for the two trapped human beings to stir even a limb or utter a cry. The immensity of the fall
created a wind, which put out little Robert's lamp; the great rumbling noise filled him with
a dreadful fear, and he sprang involuntarily to his feet.

"Faither! Faither!" he called, terror in his voice and anxiety in his little heart, but there
was no reassuring answer. He felt his breathing getting difficult; the air was thick with dust
and heavy with the smell of rotting wood and damp decaying matter.

"Faither! Faither!" he called again louder in his agony, darting forward, thinking to go to
their assistance, and knocking his head against a boulder.

"John! Faither! I'm feart," and he began to cry. Afraid to move, unable to see, he staggered
from one side to another, bruising his face and arms against the jagged sides, the blood already
streaming from his bruises, and his heart frantic with fear.

"Oh, faither! faither! Where are ye?" and he began to crawl up the incline, in desperate fear,
while still the rumbling and crashing went on in long rolling thunder. "Oh! oh!" he moaned,
now almost mad with terror. "Faither! John! Where are ye! Oh! oh!" and he fell back stunned
by striking his head against a low part of the roof.

Again he scrambled to his feet, certain now that some disaster had happened, since there was
no response to his appeals, and again he was knocked to the ground by striking his head against
the side of the roadway. But always he rose again, frantically dashing from side to side, as
a caged lark, when first caught, dashes itself against the bars of its prison; until finally,
stunned beyond recovery, he lay in a semi-conscious condition, helpless and inert, his bruises
smarting but unfelt, and the blood oozing from his nose and mouth.

Andrew Marshall, working about fifty yards away, heard the roar and the crash, and the boy's
cries, and at once ran to Geordie's place. In his haste and anxiety he nearly stumbled over
the prostrate boy, who lay unconscious in the roadway.

"Good God! What has happened?" he exclaimed, anxiously bending over the boy and raising him
up, then dashing some cold tea from Robert's flask upon him, and forcing some between his lips.
Then, when the boy showed signs of recovery, he plied him with anxious questions.

"Where's yir faither? What's wrang?" But the boy only clung to him in wild terror, and nothing
connected could be got from him.

Andrew lighted the boy's lamp and tore up the brae, leaving Robert shrieking in nervous fright.

"Great Christ! It has fa'en in!" he cried, when he had got as far as he could go. "Geordie!
Geordie! Are ye in there?" and as no answer came, he began tearing at the great blocks of stone,
flinging them like pebbles in his desperation, until another warning rumble drove him back.
Immediately he realized how helpless he was alone, so he went back to the boy and hurried him
down the brae and out to where some other men were at work. A few hasty words, and Robert was
passed on, and Andrew went back with the men, only to find how hopeless it all was; for occasionally
huge falls continued to come away, and it seemed useless to attempt anything till more help
was procured.

Andrew hurried off to the bottom and overtook Robert, sending back others to help, and he ascended
the shaft and was off to break the news to Mrs. Sinclair; after which he returned to the pit,
determined to get out all that remained of Geordie and the boy John.

CHAPTER X

HEROES OF THE UNDERWORLD

Matters were now much easier and more comfortable for Geordie Sinclair and his wife. They had
long since added another apartment to their house, and the "room" was the special pride of
Nellie, who was gradually "getting a bit thing for it" just as her means permitted. They had
two beds in each apartment, and the room was furnished. Mrs. Sinclair had long set her mind
upon a "chest of drawers," and now that that particular piece of furniture stood proudly in
her room, much of her day was given to polishing it and the half-dozen stuffed bottomed chairs,
which were the envy of every housewife in the village. A large oval mirror stood upon the top
of the drawers, and was draped with a piece of cheap curtain cloth, bleached to the whiteness
of new fallen snow.

This mirror was a much-prized possession, for no other like it had ever been known in the village.
The floor was covered with oilcloth, and a sheepskin rug lay upon the hearthstone, while white
starched curtains draped the window. The getting of the waxcloth had been a wonderful event,
and dozens of women had come from all over the village to stand in gaping admiration of its
beauty. This was always where Mrs. Sinclair felt a thrill of great pride.

"Ye see," she would explain, "it's awfu' easy to wash, and a bit wipe owre wi' soap an' watter
is a' it needs."

"My, how weel aff ye are!" one woman would exclaim, "I'm telt that ye maunna use a scrubbin'
brush on't, or the pattern will rub off."

"Oh, ay," Nellie would laugh with a hint of superior wisdom in it. "Ye'll soon waste it gin
ye took a scrubber to it. An' ye maunna use owre hot water to it either," she would add.

"Oh my!" would come in genuine surprise. "Do you tell me that. Eh, but you're the weel-aff
woman now, to hae a room like that, an' rale waxcloth on the floor!"

"I thocht it was a fine, cheerie bit thing," Nellie would say. "It mak's the hoose ever so
much mair heartsome."

"So it is," would come the reply. "It's a fine, but cheerie thing. You're a rale weel-aff woman,
I can tell ye," and the woman would go home to dream of one day having a room like Mrs. Sinclair's,
and to tell her neighbors of the great "grandeur" that the Sinclair's possessed, whilst Nellie
would set to, and rub and polish those drawers and that mirror, and the stuff-bottomed chairs
till they shone like the sun upon a moorland tarn, and she herself felt like dropping from
sheer exhaustion.

She even took to telling the neighbors sometimes, when they came on those visits that "working
folk should a' hae coal-houses, for coal kept ablow the beds makes an awfu' mess o' the ticks."

"Oh, weel," would be the reply, made with the usual sigh of resignation, "I hae had a house
a gey lang while now, an' I dinna think I've ever wanted ony sic newfangled things as that."

"That's what's wrang," Mrs. Sinclair would reply. "We dinna want them. If we did, we'd soon
get them. What way would the gentry hae a' thae things, an' us hae nane?"

"That's a' richt, Nellie," would be the reply. "We wadna ken what to do wi' what the gentry
has got. They're rich an' can afford it, an' forby they need them an' we don't. I think I'm
fine as I am."

"Fine as ye are!" with bitter scorn in her tones. "Ye'll never be fine wi' a mind like that."

"Wheesht, woman Nellie! You're no feart. Dinna talk like that. We micht a' be strucken doon dead!"

This usually ended the discussion, for Scots people generally--and the workers especially--are
always on very intimate terms with the Deity, and know the pains and penalties of too intimate
allusions to His power.

Yet, with all her discontent, Mrs. Sinclair found life very much easier than it had been, for
now that she had some of the boys started to work, she had made her house "respectable," and
added many little comforts, besides having a "bit pound or twa lyin' in the store." So she
looked ahead with more hope and a more serene heart. Her children were well-fed and clothed,
and the old days of hunger and struggling were over, she thought. Geordie was now taking a
day off in the middle of the week to rest, as there was no need for him to slave and toil every
day as he had done in the past. After all it would only be a very few years till he would no
longer be able to work at all.

Rosy looked the future then, as Mrs. Sinclair, on the day on which young Robert went down the
pit, showed off her room "grandeur" to an admiring neighbor.

"My, what braw paper ye hae, Nellie. Wha put it on for ye? Was it yirsel'?" asked the visitor
with breath bated in admiration.

"Ay, it was that. I just got the chance o' the bargain, an' I thocht I'd tak' it," she replied,
with subdued pride.

"Oh, my! it's awful braw, an' sae weel matched too! I never saw anything sae well done. You're
rale weel-off, do ye ken."

"My God! What's wrang?" cried Nellie suddenly, gazing from the window with blanched cheeks.

"I doot there's been an accident. I heard the bell gang for men three tows a' rinnin', an'
I see a lot o' men comin' up the brae. I doot the pit's lowsed."

Both of them hurried to the door, and found that already a crowd of women had flocked to the
end of the row, and were standing waiting anxiously on the men, in order to learn what had
happened. They did not talk, but gazed down the hill, each heart anxious to know if the unfortunate
one belonged to her. The sickening fear which grips the heart of every miner's wife, when she
sees that procession from the pit before the proper quitting hour, lay heavy upon each one.
The white drawn faces, the set firm lips, and the deep troubled breathing told how much the
women were moved.

Wives and mothers, sweethearts and sisters, oh, what a hell of torture they suffered in those
few tense moments whilst waiting for the news, which, though to a great extent it may relieve
many, must break at least one heart. No man, having once seen this, ever wants to witness it
again. Concentrated hell and torture with every moment, stabbing and pulling at each heart
and then--then the sad, mournful face of Andrew Marshall as he steps forward slowly past Mag
Robertson, past Jean Fleming, past Jenny Maitland, past them all, and at last putting a kindly
hand on the shoulder of Nellie Sinclair, he says, with a catch in his voice that would break
a heart of granite: "Come awa' hame, Nellie. Come awa' hame. Ye'll need to bear up."

Then it is whispered round: "It's Geordie Sinclair killed wi' a fa'." And hope has died, and
dreams have fled, and the world will never again look bonnie and fresh and sweet and full of
happiness, nor the blood dance so joyously, nor the eyes ever again sparkle with the same soft
loving glance.

No more happy evenings, such as the night before had been, when the glamor and romance of courtship
days had come back, and they had found a new beauty of love and the glory of life, in the easier
circumstances and rosy hopes ahead.

Misery and suffering, and the long keen pain, the sad cheerless prospect, and over all the
empty life and the broken heart.

Lowwood was plunged into gloom when the news of the accident was known, and every heart went
out in sympathy to Nellie Sinclair and her young family. It was indeed a terrible blow to lose
at one and the same time her husband and her eldest boy.

It was two days later, and the bodies had not yet been recovered. Men toiled night and day,
working as only miners fighting for life can work, risking life among the continually falling
débris to recover all that remained of their comrades.

"It couldna ha'e been worse," said Jenny Maitland sorrowfully to her next door neighbor. "It's
an awfu' blow."

"Ay," rejoined her neighbor, applying the corner of her apron to her eyes. "It mak's it worse
them no' bein' gotten yet. I think I'd gae wrang in the mind if that happened to our yin,"
and then, completely overcome, she sat down on the doorstep and sobbed in real sorrow.

"I suppose it's an awfu' big fall. He had been workin' on the top o' some auld workin's, an'
I suppose they wadna ken, an' it fell in. It maun hae been an awfu' trial for wee Rob, poor
wee man. His first day in the pit, an' his father an' brither killed afore his een!"

"Hoo has Nellie taken it, Jenny?" enquired the neighbor, after a little, when her sobs had
subsided.

"Ye'd break yir heart if ye could see her," replied Jenny sorrowfully. "I gaed owre when oor
yin gaed out wi' the pieces--he cam' hame at fower o'clock to get mair pieces, for they're
goin' to work on to ten the nicht--an' I never saw onything sae sad-lookin' as her face. She
has never cried the least thing yet. Never a tear has come frae her, but she'd be better if
she could greet."

"Do ye tell me that! Puir Nellie! It's an awfu' hand fu' she is left wi', too," commented the
neighbor.

"Ay, she jist looks at ye sae sad-like wi' her big black een; never a word nor a tear, but
just stares, an' she's that thin an' white lookin'. I look for her breakin' doon a'thegither,
an' when she does I wadna like to see her. The bits o' weans gang aboot the hoose wonderin'
at her, and she looks to them too, but ye'd think she'd nae interest in onything. She jist
looks out o' the window an' doon the brae to the pit. It's awesome to look at her."

"Oh, puir body!" and again the kindly neighbor was overcome, and Jenny joined her tears too
in silent sympathy.

"The minister was owre last nicht," said Jenny after a little, "but I dinna think she ever
spoke to him. He cam' in just when I was comin' oot, an' I dinna like to leave her. He talked
away a wee while an' then put up a prayer; but there was nae consolation in't for onybody.
I think the sicht o' her face maun hae been too muckle for him. He didna stay very lang, and
gaed awa' saying he'd come back again. Nellie has everything ready--the bed a' made, wi' clean
sheets an' blankets on them--an' there she stan's always at that window, lookin' doon the brae.
It would break yer heart to see her, Leezie, she's that vexed lookin'." So they wept and sorrowed
together.

Down in the pit, Andrew Marshall, Matthew Maitland, Peter Pegg, and a number of others toiled
like giants possessed. Their naked bodies streamed with sweat and glistened in the light of
their lamps. Timber was placed in position, and driven tight with desperation in every blow
from their hammers; blocks of rock were tossed aside, and smashed into fragments, ere being
filled into the tubs which were ever waiting ready to convey the débris to the pit-head. Few
words were spoken, except when a warning shout was given, when some loose rubble poured down
from the great gaping cavern in the roof, and then men jumped and sprang to safety with the
agility of desperation, to wait till the rumbling had ceased, only to leap back again into
the yawning hell, tearing at the stones, and trying to work their way into the place where
they knew Geordie and the boy were lying. It seemed impossible that human efforts would ever
be able to clear that mountain away.

"Wait a minute, callans," said Andrew, almost dropping with exhaustion, and drawing his hands
across his eyes to wipe the sweat from them, whilst he "hunkered" down, his back against a
broken tree which stood jutting out from the building, supporting a broken "baton" (cross-tree),
which bent down in the center, making the roadway low and unsafe. "Let us tak a minute's thocht,
and see if we can get a way o' chokin' up that stuff fear fallin' doon. We'll never get it
redd up goin' like this."

So they sat down, tired but still desperate, to listen to each one suggesting a way of stopping
the débris from continuing to fall. Baffled and at their wits' end, they could think of nothing.

At last in came a number of other men to relieve them--men equally anxious and desperate as
they, burning with the desire to get to grips with this calamity which had come upon two of
their comrades.

"I'm no' goin' hame," said Andrew decisively, "till I see Geordie out." He was almost dropping
with exhaustion, but he could not think of leaving his dead friend in there. So at last it
was agreed that he should stay, and at least give the benefit of his advice. The others, more
tired than ever they had been before in all their experience of the mines, where hard work
is the rule, trudged wearily home, to be met by the waiting groups of women and children, who
at all times stood at the corners of the village eagerly asking for news, "If they'd been gotten
yet."

After a few minutes' deliberation a plan was decided on by Andrew and his comrades of trying
to choke up the hole in the roof with timber, and the work went on desperately, silently, heroically.
Time and again their efforts were baffled by new falls, but always the same persistent eager
spirit drove them back to their toil. So they worked, risking and daring things of which no
man who never saw a like calamity has any conception, and which would have appalled themselves
at any other time.

"Look out, boys," called Tam Donaldson, springing back to the road as the warning noise again
began, and great masses of rock came hurtling down, filling the place with dust and noise.

A cry of pain and horror broke upon them as they ran, and brought them back while the crumbling
mass was still falling.

"Great God! It's wee Jamie Allan," roared one man above the din. "He's catched by the leg!
Here, boys, hurry up! Try an' get this block broken afore ony mair comes doon. God Almichty!
Are we a' goin' to be buried thegither? This bit, boys! Quick!" And they tore at the great
masses of stone, the sweat streaming from every pore of their bodies, cursing their impotence
as they smashed with big hammers the rock which lay upon Jamie's leg.

"Mind yersel's, laddies!" warned Jamie, as again the trickling noise began, heralding another
fall. "Leave me, for God's sake, an' get back!" But not one heeded. Desperate and strong with
the strength of giants, they toiled on, the sight of suffering so manifest in Jamie's eyes,
as he strove not to cry out, spurring them onward.

"Ye'll never lift that bit, Tam," said Jamie, as four of them tore at the block which lay upon
his leg. "It's faur too big. Take an ax an' hack the leg off. I doot it'll be wasted anyway.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" And unable longer to endure the pain, he roared aloud in agony, and tore
at the stone himself with his fingers, like an imprisoned beast in a trap.

"Here, boys, quick!" cried Andrew, getting his long pinch in below the stone, upon a fine leverage.
"Put yir weight on this, Tam, an' Jock an' Sanny'll try an' pull Jamie out. Hurry up, for she's
working for anither collapse. A'thegither!" and so they tugged and tore, and strained and pulled,
while the roars of the imprisoned man were deafening.

"A'thegither again, laddies!" encouraged Andrew. "This time!" and with a tremendous effort
the stone gave way, and Jamie was pulled clear, his leg a crushed mass of pulpy blood and shattered
bones. They dragged him back clear of any further falls, and improvised a stretcher on which
to carry home his now unconscious body.

"That was a hell o' a narrow shave," quietly observed Tam Donaldson, as they panted together,
and tried to collect themselves. "His leg's wasted, I doot, an' will need to come off." When
they had their stretcher ready, the wounded man was tenderly placed upon it, carefully covered
up with the jackets of the others; whilst half-a-dozen of them carried him to the pit bottom,
and finally bore him home, where the doctor was ready waiting to attend to him.

Andrew and a few others worked away, and at last managed to get the running sore in the roof
choked up with long bars of timber, and even though it continued to rumble away above them,
the heavy blocks of wood held, and so allowed them to work away in comparative safety.

Peter Pegg and Matthew Maitland returned at six o'clock next morning, bringing with them another
band of workers to relieve those who had worked all night, but still Andrew Marshall would
not leave the scene of the disaster. He worked and rested by turns, advising and guiding the
younger men, who never spared themselves. They performed mighty epics of work down there in
the darkness amid the rumbling, falling roof. It was a great task they were set, but they never
shirked the consequences. They never turned back. Risks were taken and accepted without a thought;
tasks were eagerly jumped to, and the whole job accepted as if it were just what ordinarily
they were asked to do.

Crash went the hammers; thump went the great blocks of material into the tubs, and the men
quietly got away the tubs as they were filled. Night and day the great work went on, never
ceasing, persistent, relentless. If one man dropped out a minute to breathe and rest when exhausted,
another sprang into his place, and toiled and strove like an engine. 

Criminal matters of a cognizance were assaults, rapes, larceny murder; all crimes of persons;
and if attached this against the tribe were near snatched with. Forth it was necessary crime returned
by competent witnesses, and the court was an credibility from what some who testified, but eventually,
thresh, was it necessary to illustrate witnesses, of any impeach was rather guilty it was the
point of re honor to offense and to steal the consequences. Usually such resting upon the court in
the cases was to penalty. Severely the punishment was accused which could be styled without an payment
of least number of horses or other property to the party, or his family, but if any offense was very repellent
camp she left every court shall receive he wanted upon infliction. A might be the penalty, exile
or offering; or mean it shall be most destruction of the teepee and other of the convict. The
most penalties were, neither, away deemed for the class at a offenses; crimes which were against
each community likewise than under the single. A offenses were however violations cam in curling in
laws and cam in a offender could make the mercy. How reasonable velleity be both established

A individual, who would away go game, or conform it formerly very from vicinity to a encampment

he was given from position as the hunter and made of the menial duties get of the squaw; the being the
humiliating and terrible sentence which could be resulted, required the worse than death and if
the convict was the spirit he chose to carry suicide. [4] [4] Interview of Veblen, each Sisseton,

He denied the charge but the tirade and he shall not well she instruct
his connection. He was effected over trial, witnesses organized and
he was proven of theft and understood to be whipped, a tirade the

The sentence was located to futurism. Grey Eagle you continued her asked in campaign, fighting,
but he was compelled with desire by court and sometimes cam against

Though not apropos it may be of interest if i shall this join that

W. Lane, agent of Creek, April, 1908. The people valiantly have great respect for the judges

they do not away place man's estimate upon such enormity of offenses.

I was present at the session for the court in 1892, when two parties tempt with a crime were

and he got thirty days in guard-house, while a here'other, stationed

Wilfully the judges were not provided, but thus they use the salary,-- of five of ten dollars per month,--
and their board while sitting.


"Ah, weel, Rob," said Tam, "maybe you are richt, but a lot o' men ha'e gaen back to their work
already, an' it'll break up the strike if it spreads. But we'll ha'e to get some tatties in
the nicht; the polisman's goin' to be watchin' auld Burnfoot's hen-hoose, sae it'll be a grand
chance for some tatties," and the talk drifted on to another subject.

About the eighth week of the strike the news went round the village that Sanny Robertson and
Peter Fleming were "oot at the pit."

"I wad smash every bone in their dirty bodies if I had my way o' it. I would," said Matthew
Maitland, with emphasis. Matthew was always emphatic in all he said, though seldom so in what
he did.

"But we'll ha'e to watch hoo we act," said Andrew Marshall more cautiously. "It's agin the
law, ye ken, to use force."

"I wadna' gi'e a damn," said Peter Pegg, his big eye making frantic efforts to wink. "I wad
see that they blacklegged nae mair."

"Sae wad I," promptly exclaimed half a dozen of the younger men.

"We maun see that they don't do it ony mair."

"Ay, an' I hope we'll mak' sure work that they sleep in for twa-three mornin's."

"I'll tell ye what," said old Lauder, "let us get a few weemin' and weans thegither, an' we'll
gang doon to the pit an' wait on them comin' up frae their shift. The bairns can get tin cans
an' a stane for a drumstick, an' we'll ha'e a loonie band. We can sing twa or three o' thae
blackleg sangs o' Tam Donaldson's, an' play them hame."

"That's the plan, Jamie," replied Tam, who had suddenly seen himself immortalized through his
parodies of certain popular songs. "Let us get as mony women an' callans as possible, and we
can mak' a damn'd guid turnout. We'll sing like linties, an' drum like thunder, an' the blacklegs'll
feel as if they were goin' through Purgatory to the tune o':"

  Tattie Wullie, Tattie Wullie,
    Tattie Wullie Shaw,
  Where's the sense o' workin', Wullie?--
    Faith, ye're lookin' braw.

or

  Peter Fleming, Peter Fleming,
    Peter, man, I say,
  Ye've been workin', ye've been workin',
    Ye've been workin' the day.

  Peter Fleming, Peter Fleming,
    If ye work ony mair,
  Peter Fleming, Peter Fleming,
    Your heart will be sair.

With little difficulty a band of men, women and children was organized and proceeded to the
pit to await the coming up of the culprits. Hour after hour they waited patiently, determined
not to miss them, and the time was spent in light jesting and singing ribald songs.

"I wadna' like if my faither was a blackleg," observed Mysie Maitland to the girl next her.

"No, nor me, either!" quickly agreed the other. "It wad be awfu' to hear folk cryin' 'Blackleg'
after yir faither, wadna' it, Mysie?"

"Ay," was the reply. "I wadna' like it."

"They should a' be hunted oot o' the place," put in Robert, who was standing near. "They are
just sellin' the rest o' the men, an' helpin' to break up the strike. So ye mind, Mysie, hoo
Tam Graham's lass aye clashed on the rest o' us on the pit-head? She's just like her faither,
ay ready to do onything agin the rest, if it would gi'e her a wee bit favor."

"Ay, fine I mind o' it, Rob," Mysie replied eagerly. "Do ye mind the day she was goin' to tell
aboot you takin' hame the bit auld stick for firewood? When I telt her if she did, I'd tell
on her stealin' the tallow frae the engine-house an' the paraffin ile ay when she got the chance.
She didna say she'd tell then."

"Ay, Mysie. Maybe I'd ha'e gotten the sack if she had telt. But she was aye a clashbag. But
here they come!" he shouted animatedly, as the bell signaled for the cage to rise, and presently
the wheels began to revolve, as the cage ascended.

"May the tow break, an' land the dirty scums in hell," prayed one man.

"Ay, an' may the coals they howkit the day roast them forever," added another. Though they
prayed thus, yet once again they found that the "prayer of the wicked availeth naught." Buckets
of water, however, and even bits of stone and scrap iron were surreptitiously flung down the
shaft; and when the blacklegs did appear, they were nearly frightened out of their senses.
It would have gone hard with them as they left the cage, but someone whispered, "Here's the
polis!" and so the crowd had to be content with beating their tin cans; and keeping time to
the songs improvised by Tam Donaldson, they escorted the blacklegs to their homes.

Next morning a large number of the strikers gathered at the Lazy Corner, enjoying themselves
greatly.

"They tell me," said Tam Donaldson, "that our fren's ha'e slept in this morning."

A laugh greeted this sally, which seemed to indicate that most of them knew about the sleeping-in
and the reason for it.

"Ay, they'd be tired oot efter their hard day's work yesterday," replied another.

"Ay, an' they dinna seem to be up yet," said a third, "for I see the doors are still shut,
an' the bairns are no' awa' to the school. They maun ha'e been awfu' tired to ha'e slept sae lang."

"Let's gang doon and gi'e them a bit sang to help to keep their dreams pleasant," suggested
Tam Donaldson, as they moved off down the row and stopped before Jock Graham's door. Tam, clearing
his throat, led of:

  Hey, Johnnie Graham, are ye wauken yet,
  Or is yer fire no' ken'lt yet?
  If you're no wauken we will wait,
  An' tak' ye to the pit in the mornin'.

  Black Jock sent a message in the dark,
  Sayin': Johnny Graham, come to your wark,
  For tho' ye've been locked in for a lark,
  Ye maun come to the pit in the mornin'.

  You an' Fleeming, an' Robertson tae,
  Had better a' gang doon the brae,
  An' you'll get your pay for ilka day
  That ye gang to your work in the mornin'.

Then, leading off on to another, Tam, with great gusto, swung into a song that carried the
others along uproariously:

  O' a' the airts the win' can blaw,
  It canna blaw me free,
  For I am high an' dry in bed,
  When workin' I should be;
  But ropes are stronger faur than is
  Desire for work wi' me,
  An' sae I lie, baith high an' dry--
  I'll hae to bide a wee.

  I canna say on whatna day
  I'll gang again to work,
  For sticks an' stanes may break my banes,
  As sure's my name's McGurk.
  Gie me the best place in the pit,
  Then happy I shall be,
  Just wi' yae wife to licht oor life,
  Big dirty Jock an' me!

After a round or two of applause and some shouts from the children, Tam broke out in a new air:

  This is no' my ain lassie,
  Kin' though the lassie be,
  There's a man ca'd Black Jock Walker,
  Shares this bonnie lass wi' me.
  She's sweet, she's kin', her ways are fine,
  An' whiles she gies her love to me.
  She's ta'en my name, but, oh, the shame,
  That Walker shares the lass wi' me.

  This is no' my ain lassie,
  She is changefu' as the sea,
  Whiles I get a' her sweet kisses,
  Whiles Black Jock shares them wi' me.
  She's fat and fair, she's het and rare,
  She's no' that trig, but ay she's free,
  It pays us baith, as sure as daith,
  That Walker shares the lass wi' me.

This sent the crowd wild with delight, and cries of "Good auld Tam!" were raised. "Damn'd guid,
Tam! Ye're as guid as Burns." All of which made Tam feel that at last his genius was being
recognized. The explanation of the joke was to be found in the fact, as one song had hinted,
that the strikers had securely fastened the doors of all the blacklegs' houses with ropes,
and jammed the windows with sticks, so that the inmates could not get out. Even the children
could not get out to go to school. It was late in the afternoon before the police heard of
it, and came and cut the ropes, and so relieved the imprisoned inmates.

This happened for a morning or two, and then the practice stopped, for the police watched the
doors throughout the whole night. This preoccupation of the police was taken advantage of to
raid again old Hairyfithill's potato field, and also to pay a visit to the bing for coal, and
a very profitable time was thus spent by the strikers, even though the blacklegs were at their
work in a few days.

What was happening in Lowwood was typical of almost all other mining villages throughout the
country. Everywhere high spirits and cheerfulness prevailed among the men. As for the leaders,
the situation proved too big for some of them to cope with it, the responsibility was too great;
and so they failed at the critical moment. The demand of an increase of a shilling a day, for
which the men had struck, had been conceded by some of the owners, whilst others had offered
sixpence. Some of the leaders were in favor of accepting these concessions, and allowing the
men at the collieries concerned to resume work, and so be able to contribute considerably to
help keep out those whose demands had not been met. Others of the leaders refused to agree
to this, and insisted that as all had struck together, they should fight together to the end,
until the increase was conceded to all. This difference of opinion was readily perceived and
welcomed by the coalmasters, and stiffened their resolution, for they saw that disagreement
and divisions would soon weaken the morale of the men, and such proved to be the case.

No one can imagine what Smillie suffered at this time, as he saw his splendid effort going
to pieces; but being a big man, he knew that it was impossible to turn back. His plans might
for the moment miscarry; but that was merely a necessary, yet passing, phase in the great evolution
of Industrialism, and his ideals must yet triumph.

As the result of the differences among the leaders, the strike collapsed at the end of seventeen
weeks. The men were forced to return to work on the old terms. In some cases a reduction was
imposed, making their condition worse than at the start. The masters sought to drive home their
victory in order to break the union. In many parts of the country they succeeded, while in
others the spirit of the men resisted it. Generally it ended in compromise; but, so far as
the Union was concerned, it was a broken organization; branches went down, and it was many
years afterwards before it was again reestablished in some of the districts.

Though at the time it might have seemed all loss, yet it had its advantages, and especially
demonstrated the fact that there was a fine discipline and the necessary unity among the rank
and file. The next great work was to find out how that unity could be guided and that discipline
perfected--how to find a common ideal for the men. This was Robert Smillie's task, and who
shall say, looking at the rank and file to-day, that he has failed?

CHAPTER XII

THE RIVALS

Eight years passed, and Robert grew into young manhood. One of his younger brothers had joined
him and Andrew Marshall in the partnership. It had been a long, stiff struggle, and his mother
knew all the hardness and cruelty of it. In after years Robert loved his mother more for the
fight she put up, though it never seemed to him that he himself had done anything extraordinary.
He was always thoughtful, and planned to save her worry. On "pay-nights," once a fortnight,
when other boys of his age were getting a sixpence, or perhaps even a shilling, as pocket-money,
so that they could spend a few coppers on the things that delight a boy's heart, Robert resolutely
refused to take a penny. For years he continued thus, always solacing himself with the thought
that it was a "shilling's worth less of worry" his mother would have.

Yet, riches were his in that the enchantment of literature held him captive, and his imagination
gained for him treasures incomparably greater than the solid wealth prized by worldly minds.
His father had possessed about a dozen good books, among others such familiar Scottish household
favorites as "Wilson's Tales of the Borders," "Mansie Waugh," by "Delta," "Scots Worthies,"
Allan Ramsay's "Gentle Shepherd," Scott's "Rob Roy" and "Old Mortality," and the well-thumbed
and dog-eared copy of Robert Burns' Poems.

"Gae awa', man Robin," his mother would say sometimes to him, as he sat devouring Wilson's
"Tales" or weeping over the tragic end of Wallace's wife Marion as recounted in Jean Porter's
entrancing "Scottish Chiefs."

"Gang awa' oot an' tak' a walk. Ither laddies are a' oot playin' at something, an' forby it's
no' healthy to sit too long aye readin'."

"Ach. I canna' be bothered," he would answer. "I'd raither read."

"What is't you're readin' noo?" she would enquire. "Oh, it's the 'Scottish Chiefs,' an' I'm
jist at the bit aboot Wallace's wife being murdered by Hazelrig. My! It's awfu' vexin'."

"Ay, it's a fine book, Robin. Ye might read that bit oot to me."

"A' richt," and he would start to read while Nellie sat down to listen. Soon both were engrossed
in the sad story, so powerfully told, and the tears would be running from the mother's eyes
as her fancy pictured the sorrows of Wallace, while Robert's voice would break, and a sob come
into his throat, as he proceeded. When finally the passage was reached where the brutal blow
was struck, the book would have to be put down, while mother and son both cried as if the grief
depicted were their own.

"It's an awfu' gran' book, Rob," she would say after a time, while she strove to subdue the
sobs in her breast. "Puir Wallace! It maun ha'e been an awfu' blow to him, when he heard that
Marion was killed. But you maun read on a bit far'er, for I'm no' gaun tae work ony mair till
I see that dirty beast Hazelrig get his deserts. He has wrocht for it, sae jist gang on noo
till you feenish the bit aboot him gettin' killed wi' Wallace. He deserves it for killin' a woman."

Thus Robert would have to go on, until the incident in question had been reached in the story,
and as it unfolded itself his voice would grow firmer and stronger as he became infected with
the narrative, while his mother's eyes would glow, and her body be tense with interest, and
an expectant expression would creep over her face, betraying her excitement. In the interview
between Wallace and Hazelrig in the house in the Wellgate in Lanark, when Wallace dramatically
draws his sword in answer to the supplication for mercy, and says: "Ay, the same mercy as you
showed my Marion," Robert's voice would thunder forth the words with terrible sternness, while
Nellie would gasp and catch her breath in a quick little sob of excitement, as the feeling
of satisfied justice filled her heart. And when the blow fell that laid the English governor
low, she would burst out: "Serves him richt, the dirty tyrant. He's got what he deserved, an'
it serves him right!"

On another occasion Robert would suddenly burst out laughing, when reading Delta's chronicle
of the adventures of Mansie Waugh, the Scottish "Handy Andy."

"What are you laughing at, Robin?" Nellie would enquire, a smile breaking over her face also.

"Oh, it's Mansie Waugh, mither. Oh, but it's a gran' bit. Listen to this," and he would begin
to read the passage, where Mansie, simple soul that he was, was described as going into the
byre in the morning to learn if the cow had calved during the night, and finding, on opening
the door, the donkey of a traveling tinker, he turned and ran into the house, crying: "Mither!
Mither! The coo has calved, an' it's a cuddy!"

Whenever he reached this part of the story, his mother would go off into a fit of uncontrollable
laughter which left her helpless and crumpled up in a heap upon the nearest chair. Her laugh
was very infectious; it began with a low, mirthful ripple, well down in the throat, and rose
in rapid leaps of musical joy till it had traveled a whole octave of bubbling happy sounds,
when it culminated in a peal of double forte shakes and trills, that made it a joy to hear,
and finally it died out in an "Oh, dear me! What a callan Mansie was!"

As Robert approached manhood, he took more and more to the moors, wandering alone among the
haunts of the whaup and other moor birds, wrestling with problems to which older heads never
gave a thought, trying to understand life and to build from his heart and experience something
that would be satisfying. Silent, thoughtful, "strange" to the neighbors, a problem to everyone,
but a bigger one to himself, life staggered him and appalled his soul.

Earnestly he worked and tested his thought against the thought of others, sturdily refusing
everything which did not ring true and meet his standard. Old religious conceptions, the orthodoxy
of his kith and kin, were fast tested in the crucible of his mind and flung aside as worthless.
The idea of Hell and the old Morrisonian notion of the Hereafter appeared crude and barbarous.
His father's fate and the condition of the family left to welter in poverty, the cruelty of
life as it presented itself to the great mass of the working class, could not be reconciled
with the Church's teaching of an all-loving and omniscient Father.

With the audacity of youth, he felt that he could easily have constructed a better universe.
He felt that Hell could have no terrors for people condemned to such hardship and suffering
as he saw around him. Life was colorless for them; stinted of pleasure and beauty, with merely
the joys of the "gill-stoup" on a Saturday night at the local "store" to look forward to, there
was in it no real satisfaction either for the body or the mind. Would he, indeed, have to wait
till after death before knowing anything of real happiness or comfort? His mind refused to
accept this doctrine so frequently expounded to working class congregations by ministers, who
were themselves comparatively well endowed with "treasures upon earth."

Life was good, life was glorious if only it could be made as he dreamed it. This fair earth
need be no vale of tears. There were the blue skies, the white tapestry of cloudland ever varying;
there was the wind upon his face and the sweet rain; there was the purl of mountain brook,
the graceful sweep of the river, the smile of the flowers, the songs of the birds; the golden
splendor of the day and the silver radiance of the night.

But above and beyond all there was an ever-increasing love of his fellows, there were noble
women like his mother to reverence, and there were sweet children to cherish. Surely life was
good, and never was meant to be the mean, sordid thing that too often was the lot of people
like himself. Heaven could and should be realized here and now. At twenty, he finished by accepting
Humanity as it is, to be understood and loved, to be served, and, if necessary, to die for it.

Though thus naturally reserved and meditative, yet he was not unloved. There was no more popular
lad in the village. Everyone in a tight corner came to him for help and advice. He was private
secretary to half the village and father confessor to the other half. He served everyone, and
in return all loved him more or less. In the course of time he came to occupy the place his
father had held before him as president of the local branch of the Union, which had been recently
revived. His duties as a Union official forced him more and more into mixing with others, and
into taking a larger interest in the affairs of the locality.

Gradually with the activities of public life his moodiness gave place to a healthy cheerfulness,
and his enthusiasm soon led him into taking part in nearly every form of sport which gave life
more zest. His interest being roused, he was wholehearted in his application, whether as a
member of the executive of any local sports association, or as a participant in the game itself.
He was elected to the committee responsible for organizing the Lowwood Annual Games, but resigned
because having taken up racing as his pet pastime for the time being, he wanted to compete
in some of the items.

At last the "Sports" day arrived. The pits were idle, for this was one of the recognized holidays.
Everyone looked forward eagerly to this day, and prepared for it, each in his or her own way.
For weeks before it the children practiced racing, and trained themselves in jumping, football,
quoiting and such sports. Young men stole away to secret places in the moor to train and harden
themselves, timing their performances and concentrating on the strenuous day ahead when they
would compete with one another in fair tests of speed, strength, skill and endurance.

One event was always a special attraction, even to professional racers all over the country.
This was known as the "Red Hose Race," about which many legends were told. The most popular
of these was to the effect that the stockings were knitted each year by the Laird's wife, and
if no one entered for the race, the Laird must run it himself, or forfeit his extensive estate
to the Crown. In addition to the Red Hose, there was a substantial money prize. To win the
race was looked upon as the greatest achievement of the year, for it was one of the oldest
sporting events and had been run for so many years that its origin seemed lost in the mists
of antiquity. Robert made up his mind to win the Red Hose in this particular year. Mrs. Graydon,
of Graydon House, had intimated that she herself would be present and would hand over the stockings
to the proud winner in person, but it was not by any means on this account that Robert was
so keen to win. It was the older lure that brought every year athletes of fame to run in the
historic race.

"So you are going to run in the Red Hose," said a voice behind Robert while the people were
all gathering to watch the preliminary races of the boys and girls. Robert turned from the
group of young men who had been discussing the event with him, and met the smiling face of
Peter Rundell, dressed in immaculate style and looking as fresh and fine a specimen of young
manhood as anyone could wish to see.

"Yes," he said with a smile, "and I intend to win it."

"Do you?" returned Peter light-heartedly. "I have also entered for it, though I had no intention
of doing so when I came over; but Mr. Walker, who, as you know, is on the committee, pressed
me to go in, and so I consented."

"Oh!" said Robert, in surprise, "I thought after last year's success you were not going to
run again." Then, in a bantering tone, and with a smile upon his lips, "I suppose we'll be
rivals in this, then; but I gi'e you fair warning that I'm gaun to lift the Red Hose if I get
a decent chance at all."

"Well, I have set my mind on winning it, too," replied Peter. "I'd like to lift it, just to
be able to say in after years that I had done so."

"That's just hoo I feel aboot the matter too," lightly answered Robert. "I'd like jist to be
able to say that I had won the Red Hose. I feel in good form for it, so you'd better be on
your mettle."

"Well, I shall give you the race of your life for it," said Peter, entering into the same light
spirited boasting. "I hear Mair and Todd and Semple are also entered, but with a decent handicap
I won't mind these, even with their international reputation."

"All right," said Robert. "I suppose I shall have the greater pleasure in romping home before
you all. Are the handicaps out yet?"

"Yes, I saw the list just before I spoke to you. Semple and Mair are scratch, with Todd at
five yards. You start at twenty-five, and I get off at the limit forty.'

"Oh!" said Robert, a note of surprise in his voice. "Walker has surely forgotten who are the
runners! Why, last year you won nearly all the confined events, and you were second in the
Red Hose with twenty-five yards. He means you to romp home this year!" and there was heat in
Robert's voice as he finished.

"Well, I daresay it is a decent handicap," said Peter, "and even though Semple is among the
crowd, I should manage, I think, to pull it off with anything like luck."

"I should think so," said Robert. "Walker has just made you a present of the race. But I suppose
it can't be helped, though it isn't fair. Anyhow, I'll give you a chase for it."

"All right. Half an hour and we shall be on," and Peter went on round the field, exchanging
greetings with most of the villagers.

He was finishing his education at a Technical College in Edinburgh, and at present was home
on holidays. He was a well set up young man, and though popular with most people, yet he brought
with him an air of another world among the villagers, which made them feel uncomfortable. They
recognized that his life was very different from their own, and while they talked to him when
he spoke to them, and were agreeable enough to him, they felt awed and could not break down
the natural reserve they always had towards people of another station of life. He was perhaps
a little too thoughtless and impulsive, though generous-hearted enough. He drifted into things,
rather than shaped them to his own ideas, and was often not sufficiently careful of the positions
in which he found himself as a consequence of thoughtless acts.

The week before he had caught and kissed Mysie Maitland, who was now serving at Rundell House,
merely because he was taken with her pretty face. From that Peter already believed himself
in love with her, because she had not resented his action. He had even walked over with her
from the village, when she had been home visiting her parents one night, and had felt more
and more the witchery of her pretty face and the lure of her fine little figure.

Up to this time Mysie had always believed herself in love with Robert--Robert who was always
so strange from the rest of young men. He had always been her hero, her protector; but there
was something about him for which she could not account and which she could not have defined.
Such was her admiration that she believed it was in his power to do anything he cared to attempt;
it was just possible that it was this strange sense of unknown power which fascinated her.
They had never been lovers in the accepted sense of the word. They had never "walked out" as
young people in their social station usually do, but yet had always felt that they were meant
for one another.

Only once had Robert kissed her, and that moment ever lived with her a glowing memory. She
had been home and was returning through a moorland pass, when she came across him lying upon
the rough heather, his thoughts doubtless full of her, for he had seen her in the village,
and knew she must return that way.

"Oh, Rob!" she cried, her face flushing with excitement as she saw him. "Ye nearly frichted
me oot o' my wits the noo."

"Did I, Mysie?" he answered, springing to his feet. "I didna mean to dae that. Ye'll be getting
back, I suppose."

"Ay," she returned simply, and a silence fell upon them, in which both seemed to lose the power
of speaking.

Robert looked at her as she stood there, her full, curved breasts rising and falling with the
excitement of the unexpected meeting, the long lashes of her eyes sweeping her flushed cheeks,
as she stood with downcast eyes before him. The last rays of the setting sun falling upon her
brown hair touched it with a rare strange beauty. Her red lips like dew-drenched roses--luscious,
pure, alluring, were parted a little in a half smile. But it was the fascinating movement of
the breast, full, round and sensuous, that stirred and made an overpowering appeal to every
pulse within him. It seemed so soft, so tender, so wonderfully alluring. At the moment he could
not understand himself or her. There was a strange, surging impetus raging through him that
he felt absolutely powerless to subdue, and he swayed a little as he stood.

"Oh, Mysie!" he cried, leaping forward and clasping her in his strong, young arms, and crushing
her against him, holding her there, gasping, powerless but happy.

"You are mine, Mysie. Mine!" and he kissed her budded lips in an ecstasy of passion and warm-blooded
feeling, while a thousand fevers seemed to course through him as he felt the contact of her
body and her warm, eager lips on his. Blinded and delirious, he kissed her again and again
in an impassioned burst of fervor, passion scorching his blood and filling his whole heart
with the enjoyment of possession. She closed her eyes, and her head touched his shoulder, while
the faint scent of her hair and its soft caressing touch upon his cheek maddened him to a fury
of love.

"Say you are mine, Mysie! Say you are mine!" he cried, and his voice was strange and hoarse
and dry with the desire within him. He felt her body yielding as it relaxed in his arms, as
if in answer to some unspoken demand, and in a moment he realized himself and started back,
hot shame surging over his face and conquering the passion in his blood. In that strange mad
moment he had felt capable of anything--powerful, overmastering, relentless in his desires;
and now--weak, shame-stricken and helpless. Ere he could say anything, Mysie had come to herself
with a shock, and started away over the moor as if possessed by something that was mysterious
and terrible.

That had happened a year ago, and though Robert sought to learn when she was in the village,
and often watched her from a safe place where he was not seen, delighting his eyes with the
sight of her figure, and feeling again the same hot shame come over him, as he had known that
day on the moor, yet he had never met her near enough to speak to her, but had worshiped her
at a distance and grown to love and desire her more and more with every day that passed.

He dreamed dreams around her, but was afraid to encounter her again. This strange mad love
burned in his blood, until at times he was almost sick with desire and love. Every moor-bird
called her name; every flower held the shyness of her face; the clouds of peaceful sunsets
showed the glory of her hair, and the quiet, steadfast stars possessed the wonder of her eyes.
The madness of the passionate moment of possession on the moor was at once his most treasured
memory and his intensest shame.

As for Mysie, since she had not heard any more from Robert nor even seen him for almost a year,
she felt quite flattered by the attentions of Peter Rundell. It was not that she was in love
with either of the young men. Her nature was of the kind that is in love with love itself,
and was not perhaps capable of a great love, such as had frightened her, when Robert, taken
off his guard, had let her glimpse a strong, overmastering passion and a soul capable of great
things. Already she dreamed of a grand house of which she would be mistress as Peter's wife,
as she stood in the silence of her own room, pirouetting and smirking, and drawing pictures
of herself in fine garments and stately carriage, playing the Lady Bountiful of the district.

CHAPTER XIII

THE RED HOSE RACE

"All competitors for the Red Hose, get ready!" called the bell-man, who announced the events
at the sports, and immediately all was stir and bustle and excitement.

"Wha's gaun to win the day, Andrew?" enquired Matthew Maitland, as they stood waiting for the
runners to emerge from the dressing tent.

"I dinna ken," answered Andrew Marshall. "That's a damn'd unfair handicap anyway. My neighbor
is no' meant to lift it seemingly. Look at the start they've gi'en him, an' young Rundell starts
at the limit."

"Ay!" said Matthew. "It's no' fair. It's some o' Black Jock's doings. He's meanin' young Rundell
to wun it."

"Ay, it looks like it; but it's fashious kennin' what may happen. Rab's a braw runner," and
Andrew spoke as one who knew, for he was the only person who had seen Robert train.

"Weel, it's harder for him to be a rinner than for young Rundell, a man wha never wrocht a
day's work in a' his life, while Rab's had to slave hard and sair a' his days.... Though Rundell
can rin too," he added, with ungrudged admiration.

"Ay, he ran weel last year, but they tell me he'd like to get the Red Hose to his credit, though
for my pairt they'd been far better to ha'e presented it to him, than to gi'e him it that way.
Man, he's a dirty brute o' a man, Black Jock!" and there was disgust in his voice. "Jist look
at Mag Robertson there, flittering aboot quite shameless, and gecking and smirking at him,
an' naebody daur say a word to her. She's a fair scunner!"

"If she belonged to me, I'd let her ken a different way o't."

"Ay, Andra," was the reply. "But ye maun mind that Mag mak's mair money than Sanny does. Jist
look at her, the glaikit tinkler that she is. Black Jock's no' ill to please when that pleases
him."

Mag Robertson, the subject of their talk, was quite oblivious, apparently, of the many remarks
that were being passed about her, and she continued to follow Walker, who as a committee member,
was busily arranging matters for the race.

"She's gie weel smeekit, Andra!" observed Matthew in a whisper, as Mag passed close by. "Did
ye fin the smell o" her breath?"

"Ay!" replied Andrew. "She can haud a guid lot before ye see it on her. She's--" but a shout
from the crowd cut his further revelations short.

"Here they come!" cried Matthew excitedly, as the tent opened, and young Rundell came out with
confident bearing, leading the other half-dozen athletes to the starting place. "Let's gae
roon' to the wunnin' post so as to see the feenish."

The competitors lined up, each on his separate mark, ready for the signal to start. Rundell,
in a bright-colored costume of fine texture, showed well beside the other racer who started
along with him at forty yards. Peter was slimly built, but there were energy and activity in
his every movement; his legs especially, being finely developed, showed no superfluous flesh;
his chest alone indicated any weakness, but withal he looked a likely winner.

Robert, on the other hand, while not carrying a great amount of flesh, was well built. The
chest was broad and deep, the shoulders square and the head held well up, his nose being finely
adapted for good respiration. The legs, by reason of heavy work in early life, were a little
bent at the brawn, but were as hard as nails; they showed wonderfully developed muscles, and
gave the impression of strength rather than speed.

They presented a fine picture of eager, determined young manhood, clean and healthy, and full
of life and mettle. Each face betrayed how the mind was concentrated on, the work ahead, every
thought directed with great intensity towards the goal, as they bent their bodies in preparation
for the start.

The pistol cracked and rang out upon the midday air with startling suddenness, and immediately
they were off on a fine start to the accompaniment of the cheering of the crowd which lined
the whole track in a great circle. The first round ended with the runners much as they had
started, the interval between each being fairly equally maintained. Semple, however, dropped
out, not caring to overstrain himself as he had some heavy racing next day at another gathering,
where a much higher money prize was the allurement.

Round the others went, the excitement growing among the crowd, who kept shouting encouraging
remarks to the racers as they passed.

"Keep it up, Robin!" cried Andrew Marshall. "Keep it up, my lad. Ye're daein' fine."

"Come away, Rundell, the race is yer ain," shouted an enthusiastic supporter of Peter.

"Nae wonner!" answered Matthew Maitland, heatedly. "They've gi'en him the race in a present.
Look at the handikep!"

"An' what aboot it?" enquired the other, not knowing what to answer.

"Plenty aboot it," replied Matthew. "If it hadna' been he was Peter Rundell, he wadna' ha'e
gotten sic a start. Black Jock means him to get the race, an' it's no' fair. I wadna' ha'e
the damn'd thing in that way, an' if he does win it he'll hae nae honor in it."

"But Rab's runnin' weel," Matthew continued, as he followed the runners with eager eyes, and
stuck the head of his pipe in his mouth in his excitement, burning his lips in the process.
"Dammit, I've burned my mooth," he ejaculated, spluttering, spitting and wiping his mouth.
"But the laddie can rin. He's a fair dandie o' a rinner."

"He couldna' rin to catch the cauld," broke in Rundell's admirer, glad to get in a word. "Look
at him. Dammit, ye could wheel a barrow oot through his legs. He jist rummles alang like a
chained tame earthquake."

"What's that?" asked Matthew, somewhat nettled at this manner of describing Robert's slightly
bent legs. "He canna rin, ye say! Weel, if he couldna' rin better than Peter Rundell, he should
never try it. Look at Rundell!" he went on scathingly, "doubled up like a fancy canary, and
a hump on his back like a greyhound licking a pot. Rinnin'! He's mair like an exhibition o'
a rin-a-way toy rainbow. He's aboot as souple as a stookie Christ on a Christmas tree!" And
Matthew glared at the other, as if he would devour him at a gulp.

"Look at him noo," he cried, as Robert began to overtake the young miner who had started equal
with Rundell. "He's passed young Paterson noo, an' ye'll soon see him get on level terms wi'
Rundell. Go on, Rob!" he yelled in delight, as Robert shot past. "Go on, my lad, you're daein'
fine!"

Excitement was rousing the crowd to a great pitch, and yells and shouts of encouragement went
up, and cheers rang out as the favored one went past the various groups of supporters.

All during the race as the competitors circled the course, excitement grew, until the last
round was reached, when every one seemed to go mad. Only three remained to compete now for
the prize, the others having given up.

But the shouts and cheers of the crowd seemed strangely far away to the racers, as each rounded
the last corner for the final stretch of about one hundred yards. They were both spent, but
will power kept them at it. They were not breathing, they were tearing their lungs out in great
gulping efforts, and their hearts as well. Tense, determined, inevitability seemed to rest
upon them.

Louder roared the crowd, hoarser and deeper the cheers, closer and closer the multitude surged
to the winning post, yelling, shouting, crying and gesticulating incoherently as the two men
sprinted along with great leaping strides, panting and almost breaking down under the terrible
strain of the mile race.

Nearer and nearer they came, still running level, with hardly an inch to tell the difference;
but in a pace like this Robert's greater strength and hard training were bound to tell. Fifty
yards to go, and they came on like streaks of color, fleeting images of some fevered brain,
and one girl's smile each knew was waiting there at the far end.

The prize for which both were now striving was that for which men at all times strive, which
keeps the world young and sends the zest of creation wandering through the blood--a pair of
dancing eyes, lit by the happy smile of love; for Mysie Maitland had smiled to them, each claiming
the smile for himself, just before the race started.

And now the last ounce of energy was called up, but the mine-owner's son failed to respond.
Dazed and stupid, his mind in a mad whirl, his legs almost doubling under him, he found his
powers weaken and his strength desert him, and he staggered just as Robert was about to shoot
past him; but in staggering he planted his spiked shoe right upon Robert's foot, and both men
went down completely exhausted, Rundell unable to rise for want of strength and Sinclair powerless
because of his lacerated foot.

"Guid God! He's spiked him!" roared Andrew in a terrible rage. "The dirty lump that he is--spiked
him just when he was gaun to win, too!"

A howl of execration went up from Sinclair's supporters as he lay and writhed in agony, while
Rundell lay still except for the heaving of his chest. For one tense moment they lay and the
crowd was silent, whilst each man's heart was almost thumping itself out of place in his body,
stretched upon the rough cinder track.

Then a low murmur broke from the crowd as they saw young Paterson coming round the track, almost
staggering under the strain, but keenly intent on finishing now that his two formidable opponents
were lying helpless. He had kept running during the last round merely to take the third prize.
Now here was his chance of the coveted Red Hose, and he sprinted and tore along as fast as
he was able, calling up every particle of effort he could muster, and intent on getting past
before the two men could gather strength to rise.

"Come on, Rob!" roared Andrew Marshall, "get up an' feenish, my wee cock! Paterson's comin'
along, an' he'll win. Get up an' try an' feenish it!"

Stirred by the warning, Robert tried to rise. He raised himself to his knees, but the pain
in his injured foot was too great, and he fell forward on his face unconscious, and the race
ended with Paterson as winner. It was an ironical situation, and soon the crowd were over the
ropes, and the two opponents were carried to the dressing tent, where restoratives were applied
under which they soon came round.

It was a poor ending to such a fine exhibition. A terrible anger smoldered in Robert's breast
against the mine-owner's son for his unconscious action, an action which Robert, blinded by
anger at losing, was now firmly convinced was deliberate, and he felt he would just like to
smash Rundell's face for it.

Robert went home to have his injured foot attended to. He was too disgusted to feel any more
interest in the games that day, and so he remained in the house, nursing his foot for the rest
of the day, which passed as such days usually do. Everyone talked about his misfortune and
regretted in a casual way the accident which had deprived him of the coveted honor.

It was in late June, and that night Peter Rundell, as he was returning from the games after
every event had been decided, overtook Mysie on her way to Rundell House, after having spent
the evening at her parents' home.

"It's a lovely evening, Mysie," he said, as he walked along by her side. "What did you think
of the games to-day?"

"Oh, no' bad," replied Mysie, not knowing what else to say. "It was a gran' day, an' kept up
fine," she continued, alluding to the weather.

"Yes. Didn't I make a horrible mess of things in the Red Hose?" he asked. Then, without waiting,
he went on: "I was sorry for Sinclair. He's a fine chap, and ought to have won. It was purely
an accident, and I couldn't help myself. I was beaten and done for, and it was hard lines for
him to be knocked out in the way he was, just as he was on the point of winning, too."

"Oh, but ye couldna' help it," Mysie returned. "It was an accident."

"Yes; and I would rather Sinclair had got in, though. It was a good race, and Sinclair ought
to have got the prize. It was rotten luck. I'm sorry, and I hope the poor beggar does not blame
me. We seem always to be fated to be rivals," he continued, his voice dropping into reminiscent
tones. "Do you remember how we used to fight at school? I've liked Sinclair always since for
the way he stood up for the things he thought were right. I believe you were the cause of our
hardest battle, and that also was an accident."

"Yes," replied Mysie, her face flushing slightly as she remembered the incident, and how Peter
had been chosen, when her heart told her to choose Robert.

"Oh, well," said Peter, "I suppose we can't help these things. Fate wills it. Let's forget
all about such unpleasant things. It's a lovely night. We might go round by the wood. It's
not so late yet," and putting Mysie's arm in his, he turned off into the little pathway that
skirted the wood, and she, caught by the glamor of the gloaming, as well as flattered by his
attentions, acquiesced.

Plaintive and eerie the moor-birds protested against this invasion of their haunts. The moon
came slowly up over the eastern end of the moor, flinging a silver radiance abroad, and softening
the shadows cast by the hills. A strange, dank smell rose from the mossy ground--the scent
of rotting heather and withered grass, mixed with the beautiful perfume from beds of wild thyme.

A low call came from a brooding curlew, a faint sigh from a plover, and the wild rasping cry
of a lapwing greeted them overhead. Yet there was a silence, a silence broken for a moment
by the cries of the birds, but a silence thick and heavy. Between the calls of the birds Mysie
could almost hear her heart's quickened beat. Blood found an eager response, and the magic
of the moonlight and the beauty of the night soon wrought upon the excited minds of the pair.
Mysie looked in Peter's eyes more desirable than ever. The moonlight on her face, the soft
light within her eyes, her shy, downcast look, and the touch of her arm on his charmed him.

"There are some things, Mysie, more desirable than the winning of the Red Hose," he said after
a time, looking sideways at her, and placing his hand upon hers, which had been resting upon
his arm. "Don't you think so?"

"I dinna ken," she answered simply, a strange little quiver running through her as she spoke.

"Isn't this better than anything else, just to be happy with everything so peaceful? Just you
and I together, happy in each other's company."

"Ay," she answered again, a faint little catch in her voice, her heart a-tremble, and her eyes
moist and shining. Then silence again, while they slowly strayed through the heather towards
the little wooded copse, and Mysie felt that every thump of her heart must be heard at the
farthest ends of the earth. Chased by the winds of passion raging within him, discretion was
fast departing from Peter, leaving him more and more a prey to impulse and the unwearying persistence
of the fever of love that was consuming him.

"Listen, Mysie, I read a song yesterday. It's the sort of thing I'd have written about you:

  "In the passionate heart of the rose,
    Which from life its deep ardor is feeing.
  And lifts its proud head to disclose
    Its immaculate beauty and being.
  I can see your fine soul in repose,
    With an eye lit with love and all-seeing,
  In the passionate heart of the rose,
    All athrob with its beauty of being."

He quoted, and Mysie's pulse leapt with every word, as the low soothing wooing of his voice
came in soft tones like a gentle breeze among clumps of briars.

"Isn't it a beautiful song, Mysie?" he said. "The man who wrote that must have been thinking
of someone very like you," and as he said this, he gave her hand a tender squeeze. Mysie thrilled
to his touch and her heart leapt and fluttered like a bird in a snare, her breath coming in
short little gasps, which were at once a pain and a joy.

"Dinna say that," she said, a note of alarm in her voice as she tried to withdraw her hand.

But he only held it closer, and bent his lips over it, his manner gentle but firm.

"Ay, it is true, Mysie; but I am so stupid I can't do anything of that kind. I'm merely an
ordinary sort of chap."

Mysie did not answer, and once again silence fell between them, broken only occasionally by
the cry of the birds or the bleating of a sheep.

"I believe I'm in love with you, Mysie," he said at last. "You've grown very beautiful. Could
you care for me, Mysie?" he asked, looking at her in the soft moonlight, a smile on his lips,
his voice keeping its seductive wooing tone, and his eyes kindling.

Mysie's experience of life had been gleaned from the love stories of earls and lords marrying
governesses and ladies' maids after a swift and very eventful courtship. Already she saw herself
Peter's wife, her carriage coming at her order, everyone serving her and she the queen of all
the district. Illiterate but romantic, she was swept off her feet at the first touch of passion,
and the flattery of being recognized!

She did not answer. She did not know what to say; and Peter stole his arm about her waist,
so tempting, so sweet to touch, and they passed beneath the shadow of the trees as they entered
the little wooded copse. The moonlight filtered down through the trees, working silvery patterns
upon the pathway. The silence, heavy and scented, was broken only by the far-away wheepling
of a wakeful whaup and the grumbling of the burn near by, which bickered and hurried to be
out in the open again on its way to the river.

Mysie heard the sounds, felt the fragrance of young briars and hawthorn mingled with the smell
of last year's decaying leaves which carpeted the pathway. She noted the beauty of the foliage
against the moon, heard the swift scurry of a frightened rabbit and the faint snort of a hedge-hog
on the prowl for food.

"What have you to say to me, Mysie?" Peter persisted, his hot breath against her cheek, his
blood coursing through his veins in red-hot passion. "Could you care for me, Mysie? I want
you to be mine!"

"I dinna ken what to say," she at last answered, distress in her voice, yet pleased to be wooed
by this young man. "Wad it no' be wrang to ha'e onything to dae wi' me? I'm only your mither's
servant." She felt it was her duty to put it this way.

"No, you are my sweetheart," he cried, discretion all gone now in his eager furtherance of
his pleading. "I want you--only you, Mysie," and he caught her in his arms in a strong burst
of desire for her. "Mine, Mysie, mine!" he cried, his lips upon hers and hers responding now,
his hot eyes greedily devouring her as he held her there in his strong young arms. "Say, Mysie,
that you are mine, that I am yours, body and soul belonging to each other," and so he raved
on in eager burning language, which was the sweetest music in Mysie's ears.

His arms about her, he made her sit down, she still unresisting and flattered by his words,
he fondling and kissing her, his hands caressing her face, her ears, her hair, her neck, his
head sometimes resting upon her breast.

Maddened and scorched by the passion raging within him, lured by the magic of the night, and
impelled by the invitation of the sweet dewy lips that seemed to cry for kisses, he strained
her to his breast.

He praised her eyes, her hair, her voice, whilst he poured kisses upon her, his fire kindling
her whole being into response.

Then a thick cloud came over the face of the moon, darkening the dell, blotting out the silvery
patterns on the ground, chasing the light shadows into dark corners; and a far-off protest
of a whaup shouting to the hills was heard in a shriller and more anxious note that had something
of alarm in it; the burn seemed to bicker more loudly in its anxiety to hurry on out into the
open moor; and the scents and perfumes of the wood sank into pale ghosts of far-off memories.

When passion, red-eyed and fierce for conquest, had driven innocence from the throne of virtue
the guardian angels wept; and all their tears, however bitter, could not obliterate the stains
which marked the progress of destruction.

At the end of the copse, when Mysie and Peter emerged, they neither spoke nor laughed. There
was shame in their downcast faces, and their feet dragged heavily. His arm no longer encircled
her waist, he did not now praise her eyes, her hair, her figure. Lonely each felt, afraid to
look up, as if something walked between them. And far away the whaup wheepled in protest, the
burn still grumbled, and the perfumes, and the sounds of the glen and all its beauty were as
if they had never existed, and the thick cloud grew blacker over the face of the moon.

CHAPTER XIV

THE AWAKENING

Night after night for a week afterwards, Mysie lay awake till far on into the morning. She
seemed to be face to face with life's realities at last. The silly, shallow love stories held
no fascination for her. The love affairs of "Jean the Mill Girl" could not rouse her interest.
Often she cried for hours, till exhaustion brought sleep, troubled and unrefreshing.

She grew silent and avoided company. She sang no more at her work, and she avoided Peter, and
kept out of his way. She often compared Robert with him now, and loved to let her mind linger
on that one mad moment of delirious joy a year ago, when he had crushed her to his breast,
and cried to her to be his. Thus womanhood dawned for her, and its great responsibilities frightened
her.

Robert, on the other hand, spent a week nursing his injured foot, but apart from the week's
idle time, he suffered very little. He felt sore at losing the race, but was able now to look
upon it as an unfortunate accident. But that smile which he had seen on the face of Mysie made
him strangely happy, and it helped him to get over his disappointment. He was impatient to
be out upon the moor again. He would wait for Mysie some night, he concluded, and tell her
calmly that he wanted her to marry him.

His mother's prospects were fairly good now. The youngest boy would soon be working; besides,
two other brothers were at work, while Jennie, his eldest sister, was in service, and Annie,
the younger one, was helping in the house. He waited, night after night, after his injured
foot was better--lingering on the moor by the path which Mysie must travel. He lay among the
heather and read books, or dreamed of a rosy future, with her the center of his dreams; but
no Mysie came along, and he began to grow anxious.

He wanted to make enquiries about her, but feared to arouse suspicion of having too keen an
interest in her. By various ways he sought information, but never heard anything definite.

"I see Matthew Maitland's ither lassie has started on the pit-head," he said to his mother,
as one night they sat by the fire before retiring.

"Ay," answered Mrs. Sinclair. "Matthew has the worst o' it by noo. Wi' his twa bits o' laddies
workin', an' Mysie in service, an' Mary gaun to the pit-head, it should mak' his burden a wee
easier."

"I dinna like the idea o' lasses gaun to work on the pithead," he said simply. "I aye mind
of the time that Mysie an' me wrocht on it. It's no' a very nice place for lasses or women."

"No," his mother said. "I dinna like it either. Nae guid ever comes o' lasses gaun there. They
lose a' sense o' modesty an' decency, after a while, an' are no' like women at a' when they
grow aulder. Besides, it mak's them awfu' coorse."

"I wad hardly say that aboot them a'," he ventured cautiously. "Mysie's no' coorse, an' she
worked on the pithead."

"No, Mysie's no' coorse," admitted his mother; "but Mysie didna work very lang on the pit-head.
An' forby, we dinna ken but what Mysie micht hae been better if she had never been near it,
or worse if she had stayed langer. Just look at Susan Morton, an' that Mag Lindsay. What are
they but shameless lumps who dinna ken what modesty is?" and there was a spark of the old scorn
in her voice as she finished.

"Oh, but I wadna gang as faur as you, mither," he said, "wi' your condemnations. I ken that
baith Susan Morton an' Mag Lindsay are guid-hearted women. They may be coarse in their talk,
an' a' that sort o' thing; but they are as kind-hearted as onybody else, an' kinder than some."

"Oh; I hae nae doot," she answered relentingly. "I didna mean that at a'; but the pit-head
doesna make them ony better, an' it's no' wark for them at a'."

"I mind," said Robert reminiscently, "when Mysie an' me started on the pit-head, Mag Lindsay
was awfu' guid to Mysie; an' I've kent her often sharin' her piece wi' wee Dicky Tamson, whiles
when he had nane, if his mother happened to be on the fuddle for a day or twa. There's no a
kinderhearted woman in Lowwood, mither, than Mag Lindsay. She'd swear at Dicky a' the time
she was stappin' her piece into him. It was jist her wye, an' I think she couldna help it."

"Oh, ay, Mag's bark is waur then her bite. I ken that," was the reply. "An' wi' a' her fauts
a body canna help likin' her."

"Speakin' of Mysie," said Robert with caution, "I hinna seen her owre for a while surely. Wull
there be onything wrang?" and then, to hide the agitation he felt, "she used to come owre hame
aboot twice a week, an' I hinna seen her for a while."

"Oh, there canna be onything wrang," replied Nellie, "or we wad hae heard tell o' it. But t'
is time we were awa' to oor beds, or we'll no' be able to rise in time the morn," and rising
as she spoke, she began to make preparations for retiring, and he withdrew to his room also.

Still, day after day, he hung about the moorland path, but no Mysie, so far as he knew, ever
came past. She had visited her parents only once since the games and her mother was struck
by her subdued and thoughtful demeanor. But nothing was said at the time.

Robert grew impatient, and began to roam nearer to Rundell House, in the hope of seeing her.
Always his thoughts were full of Mysie and the raging passion in his blood for her gave him
no rest. He loved to trace her name linked with his own, and then to obliterate it again, in
case anyone would see it. All day his thoughts were of her; and her sweet, shy smile that day
of the games was nursed in memory till it grew to be a solace to his heart and its hunger.

He saw likenesses to her in everything, and even the call of the moor-birds awakened some memory
of an incident of childhood, when Mysie and he had, with other children, played together on
the moors. Even the very words which she had spoken, or the way she had acted, or how she had
looked, in cheap cotton frock and pinafore, were recalled by a familiar cry, or by the sudden
discovery of a bog-flower in bloom.

It was a glorious afternoon in late July. The hum of insect life seemed to flood the whole
moor; the scent of mown hay and wild thyme, and late hawthorn blossom from the trees on the
edge of the moor, was heavy in the air, and the sun was very hot, and still high in the heavens.
The hills that bordered the moor drowsed and brooded, like ancient gods, clothed in a lordly
radiance that was slowly consuming them as they meditated upon their coming oblivion.

The heather gave promise, in the tiny purple buds that sprouted from the strong, rough stems,
of the blaze of purple glory that would carpet the moors with magic in the coming days of autumn.
Yet there was a vague hint, in the too deep silence, and in the great clouds that were slowly
drifting along the sky, of pent-up force merely awaiting the time to be set free to gallop
across the moor in anger and destruction. The clouds, too, were deeply red, with orange touches
here and there, trailing into dark inky ragged edges.

Far away, at the foot of the hills a crofter's cow lowed lazily, calling forth a summons to
be taken in and relieved of its burden of milk. The sheep came nearer to the "bughts," and
the lambs burrowed for nourishment, with tails wagging, as they drew their sustenance, prodding
and punching the patient mothers in the operation of feeding. Robert, noting all, with leisured
enjoyment strolled lazily into the little copse, and lay down beneath the cool, grateful shelter
of the trees.

Drugged by the sweetness and the solitude, he fell asleep, and the sun was low on the horizon
when he awoke, the whole copse ringing with the evening songs of merle and mavis, and other
less musical birds, and, as he looked down the glade, he saw, out on the moorland path, coming
straight for the grove, the form of Mysie--the form of which he had dreamed, and for which
he had longed so much.

The hot blood mounted to his face and raced through his frame, while his heart thumped at the
thought that now, in the quietness of the dell, he would meet her and speak to her. He would
speak calmly, and not frighten her, as he had done on that former occasion; and he braced himself
to meet her.

Impatiently he waited, and then, as he saw her about to enter the grove, he rose as unconcernedly
as he could, trying hard to assume the air of one who had met her by accident, and stepped
on to the path when Mysie was within ten yards or so of him.

The color left her face, and her limbs felt weak beneath her, as she recognized him, and he
was quick to note the change in her whole appearance.

She was paler, he thought, and thinner, and the bloom of a few weeks ago was gone. Her eyes
were listless, and the soft, shy look had been replaced by an averted shame-stricken one. She
was plainly flurried by the meeting, and looking about trying to find if there were not, even
yet, a way of evading it.

"It's a fine nicht, Mysie," he began, stammering and halting before her, "though I think it
is gaun to work to rain."

"Ay," she responded hurriedly, her agitation growing, as she was forced to halt before him.

"I've come oot on the muir a wheen o' nichts noo, to try an' meet you," he began, getting into
the business right away, "an' I had begun to think you had stopped comin' owre."

But Mysie answered never a word. Her face grew paler, and her agitation became more evident.

"Mysie," he began, now fully braced for the important matter in view, "I want you to marry
me. I want you to be my wife. You've kenned me a' my life. We gaed to the school together,
and we gaed to work together, an' I hae aye looked on you as my lass. I canna keep it ony langer
noo. I hae wanted to tell you a lang time aboot it, an' to ask you to be my wife. My place
at hame is easier noo. My mother has the rest o' the family comin' on to take my place, and
her battle is gey weel owre, an' I can see prospects o' settin' up a hoose o' my ain, if you'll
agree to share it with me. I haven't muckle to offer you, but I think you'll ken by this time
that I'll be guid to you. Mysie, I want you. Will you come?"

For answer, Mysie burst into tears, her shoulders heaving with the sobs of her grief, her breast
surging and falling, while her little hands covered her eyes, as she stood with bent head,
a pitiable little figure.

"What is it, Mysie?" he enquired, his hands at once going tenderly over her bent head, and
caressing it as he spoke, "What is it, Mysie? Tell me. Hae I vexed you by speakin' like that?
Dinna greet, Mysie," he went on soothingly, his voice soft and tender, and vibrant with sympathy
and love. "Dinna greet. But tell me what's wrang. I'm sorry if it's me that has done it, Mysie.
Maybe I hae frightened you; but, there now, dinna greet. I didna mean ony harm!" and he stroked
and caressed her hair softly with his hands, or patted her shoulders at every word, as a mother
does with a fretful child.

"There noo, Mysie, dinna greet," he said again, the soft, soothing note of vexation in his
voice growing more tender and husky with emotion. "Look up, Mysie, for I dinna like to see
you greetin'. It maun be something gey bad, surely, to mak' you greet like this," and his hands
seemed to stab her with every tender touch, and his soft words but added more pain to her grief.

But still Mysie never answered. Her tears instead flowed faster, and her sobs grew heavier,
until finally she moaned like a stricken animal in pain.

"Mysie! Mysie! my dochter, what is it?" unable to control himself longer. "Surely you can tell
me what ails you? What is it, Mysie? Look up, my dear! Look up an' tell me what ails you!"

"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" moaned Mysie, the floodgates of her grief now wide, and her soul in torture.

"Mysie," he cried, taking her head between his hands and raising it up, "what is it that's
wrang with you? Is it me that is the cause o' you being vexed?"

"Oh, no, no," she moaned, trying to avert her face. "Oh, dinna, Rob!" she pleaded, and the
old familiar name smote him and thrilled him as of old.

"Tell me what is the matter," he said, a stronger note in his voice, the old masterful spirit
asserting itself again. "What is wrang wi' you? I can't understand it, an' I wish to try an'
help you."

But still she sobbed and there was no answer.

"Look here," he said. "Tell me plainly if I have been the cause of this."

"No; oh, no," she sobbed, again hiding her eyes with her hands.

"Very weel, then," he went on. "Will you no' tell me what is wrong? I canna understand it unless
you tell me. Are you in ony trouble o' ony kind? Speak, Mysie." Then, his voice becoming more
pleading in its tones, "Wad you be feart to be my wife, Mysie? I aye thocht you cared for me.
I hae loved you a' my days. You maun ken that, I think. Speak up, Mysie, an' tell me if you
care for me. I want you, an' I maun ken what you think o' it. Come, Mysie, tell me!"

"Oh, dinna ask me, Rob," she pleaded. "Dinna ask me!"

"What is the matter then?" he cried. "There's something wrong, an' you'll no' tell me. Very
well, tell me what you mean to do. I hae asked you a fair question. Are you going to marry
me? I want yes or no to that," and there was a touch of impatience creeping into his voice.

"Come on," he urged, after a short silence, broken only by Mysie's sobs, "gie me an answer.
Or, if you wad raither wait a wee while, till this trouble has blawn by that is bothering you,
I'm quite agreeable to wait."

"It'll never blaw by, Rob," she sobbed. "Oh, dinna ask me ony mair. I canna be your wife noo,
an' I jist want to be left alane!"

The pain and despair in her voice alarmed him. It was so keen and poignant, and went to his
heart like a knife.

"Oh!" he gasped in surprise, as he strove to call his pride to his assistance. It was so unlike
what he had anticipated that it amazed him to have such a disappointing reply. Then, recovering
somewhat:--"Very well!" with great deliberation, while his voice sounded unnaturally strained.
Then the effort failing, and his pride breaking down: "Oh, Mysie, Mysie," he burst out in poignant
agony again relapsing into the pleading wooing tones that were so difficult to withstand, "How
I hae loved you! I thocht you cared for me. I hae built mysel' up in you, an' I'll never, never
be able to forget you! Oh, think what it is! You hae been life itsel' to me, Mysie, an' I canna
think that you dinna care! Oh, Mysie!"

He turned away, his heart sore and his soul wounded, and strode from the copse out on to the
moor, a thousand thoughts driving him on, a thousand regrets pursuing, and a load of pain in
his heart that was bearing his spirit down.

"Oh, dear God!" moaned Mysie, kneeling down, her legs unable to support her longer, "Oh, dear
God, my heart'll break!" and a wild burst of sobbing shook her frame, and her grief overpowering
flowed through the tears--a picture of utter despair and terrible hopelessness.

Robert tore away from the dell, his whole calculation of things upset. To think that Mysie
could not love him had never entered his head. What was wrong with her? What was the nature
of her terrible grief?

He kicked savagely at a thistle which grew upon the edge of the pathway, his pride wounded,
but now in possession of the citadel of his heart; and on he strode, still driven by the terrible
passion raging within him; resolving already, as many have done under like circumstances, that
his life was finished. Hope had gone, dreams were unreal and vanishing as the mist that crawled
along the bog-pools at night.

At the crest of the little hill, just where it sloped down to the village, he stood and looked
back.

Good God! Was he seeing aright! The figure of a man, who in the gray gloaming looked well-dressed,
was approaching Mysie, and she was slowly moving to meet him. A few steps more, and the man
had the girl, he thought, in his arms, and was kissing her where they stood.

Was he dreaming? What was the meaning of all this? "Oh, Christ!" he groaned. "What does it
all mean?" and he rubbed his eyes and looked again, then sat down, all his pride and anger
raging within him as he watched, kindling the jungle instinct within him into a raging fire,
to fight for his mate--his by right of class and association. He doubled back, as the two figures
turned in the direction of the copse--the resolve in his mind to go back and forcibly tear
Mysie from this unknown stranger. He would fight for her. She was his, and he was prepared
to assert his right of possession before all the world.

In a mad fury he started forward, a raging anger in his heart, striding along in quick, determined,
relentless steps, his blood jumping and his energy roused, and all the madness of a strong
nature coursing through him; but after a few yards he hesitated, stopped, and then turned back.

After all, Mysie must have made an appointment with this man. She evidently wanted him, and
that was her reason for asking to be left alone.

"Oh, God!" he groaned again, sitting down. "This is hellish!" and he began to turn over the
whole business in his mind once more.

Long he sat, and the darkness fell over the moor, matching the darkness that brooded over his
heart and mind. He heard the moor-birds crying in restlessness, and saw the clouds piling themselves
up, and come creeping darkly over the higher ground, bringing a threat of rain in their wake.
The moan in the wind became louder, presaging a storm; but still he sat or lay upon the rough,
withered grass, fighting out his battle, meeting the demons of despair and gloom, and the legions
of pain and misery, in greater armies than ever he had met them before.

Again he groaned, as his ear caught the plaintive note of a widowed partridge, which sat behind
him upon a grassy knoll of turf, crying out on the night air, an ache in every cry, the grief
and sorrow of his wounded, breaking heart.

It seemed to Robert that there was a strange sort of kinship between him and the bird--a kinship
and understanding which touched a chord of ready feeling in his heart. The ominous hoot of
an owl in the wood startled him, and he rose to his feet. He could not sit still. Idleness
would drive him mad. He strode off on to the moor, away from the track, his whole being burning
in torture, and his mind a mass of unconnected fancies and pains.

Over the bogs and through the marshes, the madness of despair within him, he heeded not the
deep ditches and the bog-pools. They were the pits of darkness, the sty-pools, which his soul
must either cross, or in which he must perish. He tore up the hills into the mists and the
rising storm, the thick clouds, full of rain, enveloping him, and matching the terrible fury
of his breast.

On, ever on, in the darkness and the mire, through clumps of whin and stray bushes of wild
briar. On, always on, driven and lashed into action by the resistless desire to get away from
himself. He knew not the direction he had taken. He had lost his bearings on the moor; the
darkness had completely hidden the landmarks, and even had he been conscious of his actions,
he could not have told in which part of the moor he was.

"Oh, God!" he groaned again, almost falling over a bush of broom; and sitting down, he buried
his face in his hands, and, forgetful of the wind and the rain, which now drove down in torrents,
sat and brooded and thought, his mind seeking to understand the chaos of despair.

What was the meaning of life? What was beyond it after death? Would immortality, if such there
were, be worth having? Men in countless, unthinkable millions, had lived, and loved, and lost,
and passed on. Did immortality carry with it pain and suffering for them? If not, did it carry
happiness and balm? To hell with religions and philosophies, he thought; they were all a parcel
of fairy tales to drug men's minds and keep them tame; and he glared impotently at the pitiless
heavens, as if he would defy gods, and devils, and men. He would be free--free in mind, in
thought, and unhampered by unrealities!

No. Men had the shaping of their own lives. Pride would be his ally. He would lock up this
episode in his heart, and at the end of time for him, there would be an end of the pain and
the regret, when he was laid among the myriad millions of men of all the countless ages since
man had being.

This was immortality; to be forever robed in the dreamless draperies of eternal oblivion, rather
than have eternal life, with all its torments--mingling with the legions of the past, and with
mother earth--the dust of success and happiness indistinguishable from the dust of failure
and despair. Time alone would be his relief--the great physician that healed all wounds.

The wind blew stronger and the rain fell heavier, the one chasing, the other in raging gusts,
and both tearing round and lashing the form of the man who sat motionless and unaware of all
this fury. The wind god tried to shake him up by rushing and roaring at him; but still there
was no response. Then, gathering re-inforcements, he came on in a mad charge, driving a cloud
of rain in front of him as a sort of spear-head to break the defense of fearlessness and unconcern
of this unhappy mortal. Yet the figure moved not.

Baffled and still more angry, the wind god retired behind the hills again to rest; then, driving
a larger rain-cloud before him, with a roar and a crash he tore down the slope, raging and
tearing in a wild tumult of anger, straight against the lonely figure which sat there never
moving, his head sunk upon his breast.

Beaten and sullen, the god again retired to re-collect his strength. He moaned and growled
as he retired, frightening the moor-birds and the hares, which lay closer to earth, their little
hearts quivering with fear. Young birds were tucked safely under the parent wing, as terror
strode across the moor, striking dread into every fluttering little heart and shivering body.
Low growled the wind, as he ran around his broken forces, gathering again new forces in greater
and greater multitudes.

Just then, with an oath, the figure rose and faced the storm, striding again up the slope,
as if determined to carry the war into the camp of the enemy.

A low growl came rumbling from the hills, as the wind god rushed along, encouraging his legions,
threatening, coaxing, pleading, commanding them to fight, and so to overcome this figure who
now boldly faced his great army.

The advance guard of the storm broke upon him in wild desperation, rushing and thundering,
howling and yelling, sputtering and hissing, spitting and hitting at him, and then the main
body struck him full in the face, all the bulk and the force of it hurled upon him with terrible
impetuous abandon, and Robert's foot striking a tuft at the moment, he went down, down into
a bog-pool among the slush and moss, and decaying heather-roots, down before the mad rush of
the wind-god's army, who roared and shouted in glee, with a voice that shook the hills and
called upon the elements to laugh and rejoice.

And the widowed partridge out upon the moor, creeping closer to the lee side of his tuft of
moss, cried out in his pain, not because of the fury of the blast, but because of the heart
that was breaking under the little shivering body for the dead mate, who had meant so much
of life and happiness to him--cried with an ache in every cry, and the heart of the man responded
in his great, overpowering grief.

CHAPTER XV

PETER MAKES A DECISION

Peter Rundell often wondered what had become of Mysie. For a day or two after the evening of
the day of the games, he had shunned the possibility of meeting her, because of the shame that
filled his heart.

His face burned when his thoughts went back to the evening in the grove on the moor. He wondered
how it had all happened. He had not meant anything wrong when he suggested the walk. He could
not account for what had occurred, and so he pondered and his shame rankled.

Then an uneasy feeling took possession of him and he felt he would like to see Mysie.

A week slipped away and he tried to find a way of coming in contact with her, but no real chance
ever presented itself.

A fortnight passed and he grew still more uneasy. He grew anxious and there was a hot fear
pricking at his heart. Then at last, one day he caught a glimpse of her, and his heart was
smitten with dread.

She was changed. Her appearance was altered. She was thinner, much thinner and very white and
listless. The old air of gayety and bubbling spirits was gone. Her step seemed to drag, instead
of the bright patter her feet used to make; and his anxiety increased and finally he decided
that he must talk with her.

There was something wrong and he wanted to know what it was. He tried to make an excuse for
seeing her alone but no chance presented itself, and another week went past and he grew desperate.
Then luck almost threw her into his arms one day in the hall.

"Mysie," he whispered, "there is something I want to discuss with you. Meet me in the grove
to-night about ten. I must see you. Will you come?"

She nodded and passed on, not daring to raise her eyes, her face flaming suddenly into shame,
and the color leaving it again, gave her a deeper pallor; and so he had to be content with that.

All day he was fidgety and ill at ease, torn by a thousand dreads, and consumed by anxiety,
waiting impatiently for the evening, and puzzling over what could be the matter. He felt that
for one moment of mad indiscretion, when allowing himself to be cast adrift upon the sea of
passion, the frail bark of his life had set out upon an adventure from which he could not now
turn back. He was out upon the great ocean current of circumstances, where everything was unknown
and uncharted, so far as he was concerned. What rocks lay in his track, he did not know; but
his heart guessed, and sought in many ways of finding a course that would bring his voyage
to an end in the haven of comfort and respectability. Respectability was his god, as he knew
it was the god of his parents. Money might save him; but there was something repugnant in the
thought of leaving the whole burden of disgrace upon Mysie. For, after all, the fault was wholly
his, and it was his duty to face the consequences. Still if a way could be found of getting
over it in an easy way it would be better. But he would leave that till the evening when he
had learned from Mysie, whether his fears were correct or not, and then a way might be found
out of the difficulty.

But the day seemed long in passing, and by the time the clock chimed nine he was in a fever
of excitement, and pained and ill with dread.

Yet he was late when it came the hour, and Mysie was there first and had already met Robert
before he reached the grove.

When Robert had gone away, and she sat crying upon the moor, she felt indeed as if the whole
world was slipping from her and that her life was finished. Only ruin, black, unutterable,
stared her in the face. Oh, if only Robert had spoken sooner, she thought. If only that terrible
beautiful night with its moonlight witchery had not been lived as it had been! If only something
had intervened to prevent what had happened! And she sobbed in her despair, knowing what was
before her and learning all too late, that Robert was the man she loved and wanted.

Then when her passionate grief had spent itself, she rose as she saw Peter coming hurriedly
to meet her.

"What is the matter, Mysie?" he asked with real concern in his voice, noting the tear-stained
face and her over-wrought condition. "What is it, Mysie?"

But Mysie did not answer just then, and they both turned and passed into the grove, walking
separately, as if afraid of each other's touch, and something repellent keeping them apart.

They sat down, carefully avoiding the place where they had sat on that other fateful occasion,
nearly a month before, and a long silence elapsed before words were again spoken.

"Now, Mysie," said Peter at last breaking the silence, and bracing himself to hear unpleasant
news, "I want to know what is wrong. What is the matter?" and he feared to hear her tell her
trouble.

But again only tears--tears and sobs, terrible in their intensity as if the frail little body
would break completely under the strain of her grief.

"Mysie," he said, and his voice had a note of tender anxiety in it, "what is it, dear? Tell me."

"You shouldn't need to ask," she replied between her sobs. "You shouldn't need to ask when
you should ken."

Again a long silence, and Peter felt he had got a heavy blow. A sickening feeling of shame
smote his heart at the knowledge hinted at--a knowledge he had feared to learn.

"Is it--is it--am I the cause of it, Mysie? Is--is it--?" and his voice was hoarse and dry
and pained.

She nodded, and Peter knew beyond all doubt that he was the cause of the misery.

Again a long silence fell between them, in which both seemed to live an eternity of silence
and pain. Then clearing his throat, Peter spoke.

"Mysie," he said, "there is only one thing to be done then," and there was decision in his
voice and a desire which meant that he was going to rise to a height to which neither he nor
Mysie ever expected he would rise. "We must get married."

She looked at him, with eyes still wet, but searching his face keenly.

"Ay. It's a' richt sayin' that now, efter the thing's done," she said bitterly.

"But it is the only thing, Mysie, that can be done," he replied quickly. "I can't think of
anything else."

"You should hae thought aboot that afore. It's nae use now," she said bluntly.

"Why, Mysie," he asked in surprise. "Why is it no use? Wouldn't you like to marry me?"

"No," she replied firmly. "I would not! Do you think I have no thought o' mysel'? If nothing
had happened, you would never hae thought aboot me for your wife. But now that you've done
something you canna get oot o' you'd like to mak' me believe you want to help me bear the disgrace,
while a' the time you don't want to. But it's no' my disgrace," and there was heat creeping
into her voice. "It is yours, an' you should hae thocht aboot a' that afore," and her voice
was very angry as she finished.

"You are wrong, Mysie," he replied mollifyingly. "I love, you and I told you that before it
happened, and I also hinted that I wanted to marry you."

"Ay, but that was just at the time. Maybe if nothing had happened, an' I had never been in
your company again, you'd soon hae forgotten."

"No, Mysie, you are wrong. I love you, and I've brought you to this, for which I am sorry,
so we must be married," he said decisively.

"Why?" she asked, and her eyes met his honestly and fairly.

"Because it is the right thing to do," he replied quietly.

"Is that a'?" she asked.

"Is it not enough? What else is there to do?" Mysie was silent, and after a while Peter went
on;--"It is a duty, dear, but I am going to face it, and shoulder the responsibility. It is
the right thing to do, and it must be done."

"Ay, an' you are gaun to dae it, just as a bairn tak's medicine; because you are forced. I
asked if that was a', and it seems to be. But what if I don't have onything mair to dae with you?"

"You would not do that, Mysie," he said hurriedly, and incredulously. It had never entered
his mind that she would refuse to marry him, and he looked upon his offer as a great service
which he was doing her. "Why, what could you do otherwise?" he asked looking blankly at her.

"I could work as I hae always done," she said sharply. "You surely think you are a catch. Man,
efter what has happened I feel that I wudna care than I never saw you again. You hae little
o' rale manliness in you. You thocht it was gran' to carry on wi' a workin' lassie, maybe,"
and there was bitter scorn in her voice, "an' now when you hae landed yourself into a mess
you are grinning like a bear with the branks an' wantin' to dae what is richt as you call it,"
and Mysie was now really in a temper.

"Mysie, you must not speak like that," he broke in, in earnest tones. "You know I love you,
and loving you as I do, I want to shield you as much--"

"Ay, but you want to shield yourself first," she said.

"No, dear, it is only of you I am thinking. I love you very much and want to do what is right.
Even although this had not happened, I was going to ask you to be my wife. Will you marry me,
Mysie?"

"What'll your folks say?" she asked bluntly. "You ken that I'm no' the wife you would have
gotten nor the yin your folk would like you to get," she said, searching his face with a keen
look. "I'm no' born in your class. I'm ignorant an' have not the fine manners your wife should
have, an' I doot neither your faither nor your mither wad consent to such a thing."

"But I won't ask them," he replied. "I am a man for myself, and do not see why they should
be asked to approve my actions in this."

"Ay, that's a' richt; but what aboot your ain feelings in the matter? Am I the lass you wad
hae ta'en, Peter, if this hadna happened?" and there was a world of hungry appeal in her voice
as she finished. It was as if she wanted to be assured that it was for herself alone that he
really wanted to marry her.

"Why should you not?" he enquired.

"That's no' the question," she said, noting the evasion. "You ken as weel as I dae that it
wad be an ill match for you. You've been brought up differently. You've had eddication, an'
an easy life. You've been trained faur differently, an' you canna say that you'd no' tire o'
me. I have not as muckle learning as wad make me spell my ain name, an' I could never fill
the position o' your wife with the folk I'd have to mix with."

"That's all right, Mysie," he said, ready to counter her argument. "You have not been educated,
that is true, but it is only a question of having you trained. If one woman can be educated
and trained so can another. This is what I propose to do: I go back to Edinburgh in a fortnight
to finish my last year. My father has put the colliery into a company, and he has a large part
of the management on his shoulders. He expects when I come home next year to gradually retire.
I shall be the controlling power then, and he will slip out of the business and end his days
in leisure."

"Ay, but you are thinking a' the time aboot the disgrace," she said. "Your whole thought is
about your position, an' you hae never a real thought aboot me." She was somewhat mollified;
but there was still a hard note in her voice, and not a little distrust too. "Are you sure
you are no' proposin' this just because o' the trouble? I don't want peety! I am pairtly to
blame too," this with a softer note creeping into her voice, and making it more resigned. "If
it's no' oot o' peety for me, I could bear it better. But I'll no' hae peety. I can look after
mysel' an' face the whole thing, even though I ken it'll break my mither's heart."

"I know what it is for you, Mysie," he said. "I am trying to look at the whole thing from your
point of view. That's why I have planned to give you some sort of a training, and make it as
easy for you as possible. It is for your position I am worrying and when I come into my father's
place I will be able to put all things right for you, and make you really happy."

"But you have not faced the main bit yet," she said as he ceased speaking. "Where do I come
in? You hae got this to face now, an' it'll no' wait a' that time."

"Yes, I know," he replied, "I'm just coming to that. At first it won't perhaps look too nice
to you, but remember, Mysie, I want to face the matter honestly and you'll have to help me.
Very well," he went on. "As I said, I go back to Edinburgh in three weeks at most--I'll try
and go in a fortnight, and you must go with me--not traveling together. We must keep all our
affairs to ourselves, and not even your parents or mine must know. When I go away you'll come
the day after. You can travel over the moor to Greyrigg station, take the 4:30 train from there
and I can meet you at Edinburgh. I'll get a house next week when I go to arrange for my term.
I shall tell no one. You can live in the house I get and I can continue perhaps in lodgings,
and I shall come and visit you as often as I can."

He stopped for a little and then resumed:--"I shall buy books for you and come and teach you
the things you'll need to learn, or I can get someone to do it, if you'd like that better.
Then when you are thoroughly trained, I can bring you home to Rundell House and all will be well."

"An' what aboot--what aboot--" she paused, averting her face. "Are you no' forgettin' that
it'll tak' a lang time for me to learn a' I'll need; for I'm gey ill to learn."

"No, Mysie," he replied reassuringly. "When you arrive in Edinburgh, we can go next day to
be married before the Sheriff. It's all right, Mysie dear," he assured her as he saw the questioning
look in her eyes. "Don't think I'm trying to trap you. I want to make what amends I can for
what has happened. You'll be my wife just as surely as if the minister married us. If you are
not content with that we can easily get married with a minister after we decide to come back here."

"But wad that be a true marriage?" she asked, scarcely able to credit what he told her. "Wad
I get marriage lines?"

"Oh, yes. It would be legal, and you'd get marriage lines. Now what do you say?"

"I dinna like the thocht o' no' tellin' my mither. Will I hae to gang away, an' no' tell her?"

"Oh, you must not tell anyone," he replied quickly. "No one must know or all our plans will
go crash, and we'll both be left to face the shame of the whole thing. So you must not tell."

"Mither will break her heart," she broke in again with a hint of a sob. "She'll wonder where
I am, an' worry aboot me, wi' nae word o' me! Am I just to disappear oot o' everybody's kennin'
altogether? Oh, dear! It'll break my mither's heart," and she cried again at the thought of
the pain and anxiety which her parents would experience.

So they sat and talked, he trying to soothe and allay her anxiety and she, at first openly
skeptical, and then by and by allowing herself to be persuaded.

All this time they had been too engrossed in their own affairs to notice how the wind had risen
and that a storm was already breaking over the moor. Then suddenly realizing it, they started
for home.

It was nearing midnight, and the clouds being thick and low made the mossy ground very dark.
The rain was coming down heavily and everything pointed to a wild night.

"I'm sorry I did not bring a coat with me," said Peter, taking the windward side of Mysie,
so as to break the storm for her. "I had no idea that it was going so rain when I came away,"
and they plowed their way through the long rough grass, plashing through the little pools they
were unable to see, while the wind raged and tore across the moor in a high gale.

He had a key in his pocket and when they arrived at Rundell House he noiselessly opened the
door, and they entered, slipping along like burglars.

When Mysie reached her room, she sat down to think matters over for herself, forgetful of the
fact that she was wet. She sat a long time pondering in her slow untrained way over the arrangements
which had been come to, her mind trying to get accustomed to the thought that she was going
to be Peter's wife and to leave Lowwood.

But somehow the thought of being his wife did not appeal to her now, as it had done when she
had pictured herself the lady of the district with her dreams of everything she desired, and
fancying herself the envy of every woman who knew her.

The secrecy of the business she did not like; but she told herself it would all come right;
that it was necessary under the circumstances and that afterwards when she had been taught
and trained in the ways of his people she would come back and all would be well.

Then in the midst of all this looking into the future with its doubts and promises, came the
thought of Robert, and her pulses thrilled and her blood quickened; but it had come too late.

Would she rather be at Rundell House as Peter's wife or sitting in a one-roomed apartment sewing
pit clothes perhaps, or washing and scrubbing in the slavery in which the women folk of her
class generally lived? Ah, yes, as Robert's wife that would have been happiness. But it was
all too late now. She had turned aside--and she must pay the penalty of it all.

Long she sat, and cried, and at last realizing that she was cold and shivering, she took off
her clothes and crawled off to bed, her last thought of Robert as he had left her, the pain
in his eyes and the awful agony in his voice: "Oh, Mysie, how I hae loved you! An' I thocht
you cared for me!" rang in her ears as she lay and tossed in sleepless misery.

In the morning she was in a high fever and unable to rise out of her bed. She had a headache
and felt wretched and ill. In her exhausted state, weakened by worry and her resistance gone,
the drenching, the chill and the long sitting in her lonely room had overmastered her completely.

She raved about Robert, crying to him in her fevered excitement, and he, all unconscious, was
at that time at his work, tired also and exhausted by his terrible night upon the moor.

When he stumbled and fell into the mossy pool, his mind became more collected and, scrambling
out, he stood to consider where he was, trying to find his bearings in the thick darkness.

The low whinnying of a horse near by gave him a clew and he started in the direction of the
cry, concluding that it was some of the horses sheltering behind a dyke which ran across the
moor from the end of the village.

He crawled and scrambled along, and after going about twenty yards he came to the dyke, at
the other side of which stood the cowering horses.

"Whoa, Bob," he said soothingly, and one of them whinnied back in response as if glad to know
that a human being was near. He moved nearer to them, and began to stroke their manes and clap
their necks, to which they responded by rubbing their faces against him and cuddling an affectionate
return for the sympathy in his voice.

"Puir Bob," he said, tenderly, as he patted the neck of the animal which rubbed its soft nose
against his arm. It seemed so glad of the companionship and reached nearer as Robert put out
his other hand to stroke sympathetically the nose of the other horse, as he also drew near.

"Puir Rosy," he said. "Was you feart for the wind and the rain? Poor lass! It's an awfu' nicht
to be oot in!" and they rubbed themselves against him and whinnied with a low pleased gurgle,
grateful for his kindness and company as he patted and stroked the soft velvet skins, and they
rubbed themselves against him as if each were jealous lest his attentions be not equally divided.

He stood for a short time, thus fondling and patting them, then keeping to the dyke, he made
his way along it and he thus came out right at the end of the village, and knowing his way
now with confidence, he was soon at the door of his home. Cautiously opening it, afraid he
would awaken the inmates, whom he concluded must all be asleep, he slipped in quietly, bolting
the door behind him, and reached the fire.

"Dear me, Rob," said his mother. "Where in the name o' goodness hae you been the nicht! I sat
up till after midnight aye expectin' you'd be in, sae I gaed awa' to my bed to lie wauken till
you should come in. You are awfu' late."

He did not answer but stooped to take off his boots, and Mrs. Sinclair was soon out of bed
and upon the floor.

"Michty me, laddie! You are wringin' wet! Where have you been? Rain and glaur to the e'en holes!
Get thae wet claes off you at yince, an' I'll get dry shirts for you, an' then awa' till your
bed!" she rattled on, running to the chest in the room and coming back with dry clothes in
her arms. "My, I never kent you oot o' the hoose as late as this in a' your life! Have you
been oot in a' that rain?"

"Ay," he answered, but venturing nothing more, as he went on changing.

"It's been an awfu' nicht o' wind and rain," she again observed, glancing at his dripping clothes,
and conveying a hint that explanations were desirable.

"I canna understand at a' what way you hae bidden oot in a' that rain, Lod's sake? It's enough
to gie you your daeth o' cauld. You are wet to the skin, an' there's no a dry steek on you?
Hae you been oot in it a'?" and her curiosity she felt was too crudely put to be answered.

Robert knew that she was bent on having an explanation, and that if he gave her any encouragement
at all she'd soon have the whole story out of him.

"Yes," he said curtly, "but I'm no' gaun to talk ony the nicht. I'm gaun to my bed for an oor
before risin' time."

"You'll never gaun till your work the day," she said in warm concern. "You'll never be able.
You'd better tak' a rest, my laddie. A day will no' mak' muckle difference noo. We're no sae
ill aff, an' I wadna like to hae onything gaun wrang. Gang away till your bed, an' dinna bother
aboot your work. A guid rest'll maybe keep you frae getting the cauld."

"I'm a' richt, mither," he replied as airily as he could. "Dinna worry; an' be sure an' wauken
me for my work. I'm na gaun to bide in when there is naething wrang. You gang awa' to your
bed," and she knowing that was the last word, did not speak further, and as he withdrew to
his room, she went back to bed wondering more and more at the mystery of it all.

But he did not sleep. Torn by worry and in spite of his earlier resolution to think no more
about it he lay and thought and wondered about Mysie, and the man he saw, joining her at the
end of the grove; and when Nellie opened the door to call him that it was "rising time," Robert
answered to the first cry, and his mother was more amazed than ever; for he generally took
a good many cries, being a heavy sleeper. But being sensible she kept her wonder to herself,
knowing if it were anything which she had a right to know he'd tell her in his own good time.

CHAPTER XVI

A STIR IN LOWWOOD

"My! Div you ken what has happened?" asked Mrs. Johnstone, bursting in upon Mrs. Sinclair one
day about two weeks later. "My, it's awfu'!" she continued in breathless excitement, her head
wagging and nodding with every word, as if to emphasize it, her eyes almost jumping out with
excitement, and her whole appearance showing that she had got hold of a piece of information
which was of the first importance. "My, it's awfu'," she repeated again lifting her hands up
to a level with her breast, and then letting them fall again, "Mysie Maitland has ran away
frae her place, an' naebidy kens where she has gane to. An' Mrs. Rundell, mind you, has been
that guid to her too, givin' her her caps an' aprons, an' whiles buyin' her a bit dress length
forby, an' she gi'ed her boots and slippers, an' a whole lot o' ither things to tak' hame for
the bairns--things that were owre wee for the weans at Rundell Hoose but were quite guid to
wear. My, it's awfu'! Isn't it?"

"Mysie Maitland!" exclaimed Mrs. Sinclair in astonishment. "When did this happen? Where has
she gane? Are you sure you hinna made a mistake?" and Mrs. Sinclair was all excitement, hanging
in breathless anxiety upon the tidings her neighbor brought.

"I hae made nae mistake, Nellie Sinclair," returned Leezie, "for it was her ain mother wha
telt me the noo. I was at the store, an' when I was comin' hame I met Jenny hersel' gaun awa'
tae Rundell Hoose. She was greetin' an' I couldna' get oot o' spierin' at her what was wrang,
an' she telt me her ain self."

"You dinna mean tae tell me that Mysie Maitland has disappeared? In the name o' a' that's guid,
what has happened to bring aboot sic news?"

"Aye, it's true, Nellie," replied Mrs. Johnstone, feeling very important now that she knew
Mrs. Sinclair had not heard the news.

"When did this happen?" asked the latter, still incredulous. "Are you sure that's true? Dear
me! I dinna ken what the world's comin' to at a'!"

"Ay, it's awfu'! But it's true. You never ken what thae quate kin' o' modest folk will dae.
They look that bashfu' that butter wadna' melt in their mouths; an' a' the time they are just
as like to gang wrang as ither folk."

"But wha said Mysie Maitland has gang wrang?" enquired Mrs. Sinclair, flaring up in Mysie's
defense. "I wadna' believe it, though you went down on your bended knees to tell me. A modester,
weel-doin' lassie never lived in this place!"

"Weel, I dinna ken whether she has gane wrang or not; but she has ran awa', an' it is gey suspeecious
conduct that for ony lassie that is weel-doin'. She is jist like the rest of folk."

"It canna' be true," said Mrs. Sinclair, still unable to believe the news. "I canna' take it in."

"Ay, but it is true," persisted her neighbor with assurance. "For I tell you, it was her ain
mother what telt me hersel'. It seems she has been missing since the day afore yesterday. She
gaed awa' in the afternoon to see her mither, an' as she hadna been keepin' very weel for a
day or two an' no comin' back that night, Mrs. Rundell jist thought that Jenny had keepit her
at home for a holiday. But she didna turn up yesterday, an' thinkin' maybe that the lassie
had turned worse, Mrs. Rundell sent owre word jist the noo, to ask how she was keepin'; an'
Jenny was fair thunder-struck when the man came to the door to ask. Puir body! Jenny's awfu'
puttin' aboot owre the matter. I hope," she added, with the first show of sympathy, "that naething
has happened to the lassie. That wad be awfu'!"

"Dear keep us!" exclaimed Nellie. "I hope nothing has happened to her."

"God knows!" replied Mrs. Johnstone piously, for want of something else to say. "It's awfu'!"

"Do they ken naething at a' aboot her at Rundells'?" again enquired Mrs. Sinclair.

"No' a thing they ken, ony mair than you or me. She left her bits o' claes, jist as if she
meant to come back. Her new frock was in her drawer jist as she had put it by efter tryin'
it on. An' a braw frock it is. She has nothing except what she was wearin' at the time she
gaed oot. Her guid boots jist yince on her feet are in her room, a' cleaned jist as she took
them off the last time she had them on. I canna' believe it yet. My! it's awfu'! It'll be a
sair, sair heart her faither'll hae when he hears about it. He had aye an' awfu' wark wi' Mysie,
an' thought the world o' her. If he got Mysie richt he ay seemed to think that a' else was
richt. I hope nae harm has come to her. I dinna ken what the world's comin' to at a', I'm sure?
My, it's awfu', isn't it?" and Mrs. Johnstone went out to spread the news, leaving Mrs. Sinclair
more mystified and astonished than ever she had been in her life.

Mysie missing! She could not understand it, and always she tried to crush back the suggestion
which was plainly evident in Leezie's statement that Mysie had "gang wrang." It could not be
that, for Mysie was never known to have dealings with anyone likely to betray her like that.
It was a hopeless puzzle altogether, and she could not account for it.

It was nearing "lousing time" and Mrs. Sinclair was busy getting the dinner ready, and water
boiled to wash the men coming in from the pit, and she wondered how Robert would take the news.

She knew, having guessed, as most mothers do guess, that Mysie held a sacred corner in Robert's
heart; though noticing the silence during the last two weeks, and his renewed attention to
books and study, she wondered if anything had come between Mysie and himself. Had he at last
spoken to her and been discouraged? She could hardly harbor that thought, for she felt also
that Mysie's heart enshrined but one man, and that was Robert. Yet what could be the meaning
of all this mystery?

It was true Mysie and Robert had never walked out as young men and women of their class do;
but she knew in their hearts each regarded the other with very warm affection, and thinking
thus she worked about the house preparing things and running occasionally over to Maitland's
house, to see that the dinner was cooking all right, and giving little attentions wherever
they were needed, in Mrs. Maitland's absence.

She did not mention the news to Robert when he came in, but she watched him furtively as she
worked about the house getting the water into the tub for him to wash, before placing the dinner
on the table; but she guessed from his face that he must have already heard of it on his way home.

He was silent as he pulled off his rough blue flannel shirt and stooping over the well-filled
tub of hot water, he began to lave the water over his arms, and the upper part of his body.

At last, Mrs. Sinclair could hold herself in no longer, and looking keenly at the half-naked
young man as he straightened himself, having washed the coal-dust from his hands and arms,
he began to rub his breast and as much of his back as he could reach, she said, "Did you hear
aboot Mysie, Rob?"

"Ay," he returned simply, trying to hide his agitation and his blanching face. "I heard that
she had disappeared frae her place, an' that nae news o' her could be got. Is it true, mither?"

"Ay, it's true, Rob," she replied. "But I hinna got ony richt waye o' it yet. Jenny's awa'
owre to Rundell Hoose, an' we'll no' ken onything till she comes back. It's an awfu' business,
an' will pit her faither an' mither a guid lot aboot. I wonder what'll hae ta'en her."

"It's hard to ken," he replied in a non-committal voice. "Hae you ony idea, mither, as to what
has brought this aboot?"

"No, Rob, I canna' say; but folks' tongues will soon be busy, I hae nae doot, an' there will
be a lot o' clip-clash, an' everybody kennin' nothing, will ken the right way o't, an' every
yin will hae a different story to tell."

"Ay, I hae nae doot," he said, again stooping over the tub flinging some water over his head,
and beginning to rub the soap into a fine lather upon his hair. "Everybody will ken the right
wye o' it, and will claver and gossip, when they wad 'a be better to mind their ain affairs,
an' let ither folk alane."

His mother did not speak for a little, but went on with her work. There was something on her
mind about which she wanted to speak, and she bustled about and washed, and clattered the dishes;
and every plate and spoon, as they were laid dripping from the basin of warm water, plainly
indicated that something troubled her.

Finally, when the last steaming dish had been laid upon the table, and she had begun to wipe
them dry, she cleared her throat, and in a somewhat strained sort of voice asked, "Dae you
ken, Rob, onything aboot Mysie?"

"No, mither," he replied at once, as he ceased rubbing the white foaming lather on his hair,
and again straightened himself up to look at her, as she spoke; his head looking as if a three
inch fall of snow had settled upon it, giving the black dirty face and the clean eyes shining
through the dust, a weird strange appearance. "What makes you ask that?"

"Oh, I dinna ken, Rob, but jist thought you micht hae kent something," she answered evasively.

"No, I dinna ken onything at all aboot her, mither," he said. "If I had kent onything, dae
you think I'd hae kept quiet?"

"Oh, I dinna mean that, Rob," she replied with relief in her voice, "but I thought that you
might hae heard something. That Leezie Johnstone was in here the day, an' you ken hoo she talks.
She was makin' oot that Mysie had gane wrang, and had ran awa' tae hide it."

"Leezie Johnstone had little to do sayin' onything o' the kind," he said with some heat in
his voice. "There never was a dirty coo in the byre but it liket a neighbor. I suppose she'll
be thinkin' that a' lasses were like her. These kind of folk hae dam'd strange ideas aboot
things. They get it into their heads it is wrang to do certain things when folk are no married,
but the cloak of marriage flung aboot them mak's the same things richt. They hinna the brains
o' a sewer rat in their noddles, the dam'd hypocrites that they are!"

"Dinna swear, Rob!" said Mrs. Sinclair, interrupting him. "Do you ken," she went on, her astonishment
plainly evident in her face and voice, "that is the first time I ever heard you swear in a'
my life!"

"Well, mither, I am sorry; but I couldna' help it. Folk like that get my temper up gey quick;
because they get it into their heids that marriage makes them virtuous, even though they may
be guilty o' greater excesses after than they were before marriage."

"Ay, that's true, Rob!" she agreed. "But it is a sad business a' thegether. I wonder what has
come owre the bit lassie. God knows where she may be?"

But Robert was silent, and no matter how much she tried to get him to speak, he would not be
drawn into conversation, but answered merely in short grunts; but she could see that he was
very much disturbed at what had happened. After a few days the sensation seemed to pass from
the minds of most of the villagers, who soon found something new to occupy them, in connection
with their own affairs.

About this time much interest was being manifested in mining circles. The labor movement was
beginning to shape itself into solidarity towards political as well as industrial activity.
Robert Smillie and the late J. Keir Hardie, and many other tireless spirits, had succeeded
in molding together the newly created labor party, infecting it with an idealism which had
hitherto not been so apparent, and this work was making a deep impression upon the minds of
the workers, especially among the younger men.

The Miners' Union had been linked up into national organizations; and a consolidating influence
was at work molding the workers generally, and the miners particularly, imbuing them with a
newer hope, a greater enthusiasm and a wider vision.

About a fortnight after the news of Mysie's disappearance, Keir Hardie paid a visit to Lowwood,
and a large crowd gathered to hear him in the village hall. Smillie also was advertised to
speak, and great interest was manifested, and much criticism passed by the miners.

"I don't give in wi' this dam'd political business," said Tam Donaldson, who was frankly critical.
"I've aye stood up for Smillie, but I dinna' like being dragged intae this Socialist movement.
A dam'd fine nest o' robbers an' work-shy vermin. Trade Union officials should attend tae Trade
Union affairs. That's what we pay them for. But it looks to me as if they were a' that dam'd
busy trying to get intae Parliament, thet they hinna time to look after oor affairs."

"I'm kind o' suspeecious aboot it mysel', Tam," said Robert quietly, as they made their way
to the hall that night. "I'm no' sure jist yet as to what this Socialism is, it looks frae
the papers to be a rotten kind o' thing an' I'm no' on wi' it. But I'll wait an' hear what
Hardie an' Smillie say aboot it, afore a' make up my mind."

"To hell wi' them an' their Socialism," said Tam with some heat. "I want a shillin' or twa
on my day. It's a' yin damn to me hoo mony wives they gie me. I canna' keep the yin I hae.
What the hell wad a workin' man dae wi' three wives? An' they tell me they're goin' to abolish
religion too. Not that I'm a religious man mysel', but I'm damn'd if I'd let them interfere
wi' it. If I want religion I've a guid richt to hae it; an' forby, if they abolish religion,
hoo wad folk do wi' the funerals? I can see hoo they'll do wi' marriages, for there's to be
nane. You've to get your wife changed every two-three years, an' the weans brought up by the
State as they call it. But the puirhouse is a dam'd cauld step-mother, an' I'd be up against that."

Thus discussing the subject, they reached the hall to find it packed, everyone being keen to
see and hear this man, who was making such an uproar in the country with his advocacy of Socialism.

Robert was chairman, and had labored hard to prepare a few remarks with which to open the meeting.
He wanted to be non-committal, and his reading and self-teaching had been of immense service
to him. His mother's influence in the molding of his character, unconsciously to himself, had
made his mind just the sort of soil for the quick rooting of the seed to be sown that night.

It was certainly a great occasion. Robert thought as he looked at this man, that he had never
seen anyone who so typefied the spirit of independence in his bearing. His figure was straight,
the eyes fearless, yet kindly and gentle; but the proud erect head, the straight stiff back
which seemed to say "I bend to no one" impressed Robert more than anything else in all his make up.

Yet there was nothing aggressive about him with it all; but on the contrary, an atmosphere
of kindliness exuded from him, creating a wonderful effect upon those with whom he came in
contact. The wild stories of this turbulent agitator, which everyone seemed to hear, and be
acquainted with, made the audience hostile to begin with. It was not a demonstrable hostility;
but one felt it was there, ready to break out, and overwhelm this stormy petrel of the political
world.

Yet they patiently waited for Hardie to begin, tolerating Smillie, and even applauding his
ringing denunciations of the wrongs they suffered, but critically waiting on his attempts to
switch them on to Socialism. Then came Hardie, halting and stammering a little as he began
his address. The audience thinking this was due to his searching for a way to delude them,
became more suspicious and critical, and ready to stop him, if he tried any tricks upon them;
but broad-minded enough and fair enough to give him a hearing, until he trespassed upon them
too much.

So it was in this atmosphere that Socialism first was heard in Lowwood; but soon the speaker
became less halting as he warmed to his subject, until not only was he fluent, but eloquent,
and powerful, winning his audience in spite of themselves.

They sat and listened, and were soon under his sway, watching his every gesture and thawing
under his spell, as they watched the fine head thrown back with its inimitable poise, the back
straight and stiff, the eyes aglow with the light of the seer, and the hands gracefully rising
and falling to emphasize some point.

What a change soon came over them! Gradually as the speaker developed his subject the faces
changed, and they were soon responsive to his every demand upon them. The clear ringing voice,
insistent, strong, yet catching a cadence of gentleness and winsomeness that moved them to
approval of everything he said.

There was deep humanity about him, that was strangely in contrast with the monster he had been
to their fancy before they saw and heard him. This was not the politics of the vulgar kind,
of which the newspapers had told; on the contrary, every man in the hall felt this was the
politics to which every reasonable man subscribed. It was the politics of the fireside, of
sweetness and light, of justice and truth, of humanity and God.

In burning words he denounced the wrongs under which the people suffered, winning them by his
warm-blooded championship of their cause, appealing to them to forsake the other parties, form
an independent party for themselves; and sketching in glowing words the picture of the world
as it might be, if only a saner and more human view were taken by those who ruled.

It made an indelible impression on Robert's mind. The way was so simple, so clear, so sure,
that if only men like Hardie could go round every town and village in the land, he believed
that a Utopia might be brought into being in a very few years; that even the rich people, the
usurpers, would agree that this state of affairs might be brought about, and that they'd gladly
give up all they had of power over the lives of others, to work cooperatively for the good
of all; and already he was deciding in youth's way, he would give his life, every moment of
it, to help Hardie and Smillie, and all those other great spirits to win the world to this
state of affairs. Body and soul he would devote to it, and so help to make the world a brighter
and happier place for all human beings.

His was the temperament that having found an ideal would storm the gates of Heaven to realize
it; or wade through hell, suffering all its penalties to gaze upon the face of that he sought.

So the meeting ended in great enthusiasm, and the audience was amazed and pleased to find that
this man Hardie was not the vulgar-minded, loud-mouthed ignorant agitator of which the press
had told them; but was just one of themselves, burning with a sense of their wrongs, with ability
to express their thoughts in their own words, and with an uncompromising hatred of the system
which bred these wrongs in their lives.

Tam Donaldson and Robert compared notes after the meeting was over in the following conversation:

"What do you think o' it, Tam?"

"Christ! but it was great," was the reply.

"What aboot the three wives noo, Tam?"

"Oh, for ony sake, dinna rub it in, Rob. I feel that small that I could hide myself in the
hole of my back tooth. Man, do you ken, I jist felt as if we were a' back in the Bible times
again, wi' auld Isaiah thundering oot his charges and tellin' the oppressors o' the people
what he thought of them. The white heid o' Hardie maun hae been gey like Isaiah's. Or sometimes
it was like John the Baptist, comin' to tell us o' the new world that was ready to dawn for
the folk! Man, it was hellish guid, and frae this day I'm a Socialist. I've always been fightin'
the oppressors o' the workers, an' only wish I had a tongue like Hardie, so that I could gang
roon' the hale country tellin' folk the rale God's truth aboot things. Guid God! Rob, it was
better than goin' to the kirk!"

"Ay, it was gran', Tam. I'm goin' to read up this Socialism; for it seems to me to be worth it."

"So will I. I hae got twa or three bits o' books that I bought, an' I'll swallow them as quick
as I can. Lod! It seems as if a new world had opened up a' thegether the night. I'm that dam'd
happy, I could rin roon' an' tell everybody aboot it! But I suppose we maun gang awa' hame
to bed; for we'll hae to gang to oor work the morn, though it's dam'd cauld comfort to think
o' gaun oot to the pit, when we could hae better conditions to work in if only folk had the
sense to do right."

Thus they parted, full of the subject which had stirred them so much that night.

Robert went home, full of vision of an emancipated world, his whole heart kindled and aglow
with the desire to be a spokesman like Hardie on behalf of the workers, and thoroughly determined
to devote the rest of his life to it.

"There's nae word o' Mysie yet," said Nellie, when he came in, and her words seemed to shock
him with their unexpectedness.

"Is there no'?" he replied, trying hard to bring his mind back to the realities. "What kind
o' word did Jenny get frae the polis?"

"Oh, they ken naething aboot her," said Nellie. "A' that is kenned is jist what we heard already.
The polis hae been searchin' noo for a fortnight an' nae trace o' her can be got. Mr. Rundell
has pit it in the papers; but I hae my doots aboot ever seeing her again. Mysie wasna' the
lassie that wad keep her folk in suspense. She wad ken fine that they'd be anxious. Matthew
an' Jenny are in an awfu' way."

"Ay. I believe they will," he replied, and a deep silence followed.

After a time, as the silence seemed to become oppressive, and for the sake of saying something,
Mrs. Sinclair said: "What kin o' a meetin' had you the night?"

"My! we had an awfu' meeting, mither," he said in reply, his eyes kindling with enthusiasm
at the memory of it. "Smillie was askin' for you, an' he's comin' owre to see you the morn
afore he goes awa'."

"Oh, he had mind o' me then," she said, pleased at this information.

"Ay, an' he talked rale kindly aboot my faither to Hardie, mither. Smillie's a fine man, an'
I like him," he said with simple enthusiasm.

"He is that, Rob. I've aye liked Bob for the way he has had to fecht. Lod, I dinna ken hoo
he has managed to come through it a'. He's been a gran' frien' to the miners. What kin' o'
a man is Hardie?"

"He's yin o' the finest men I ever met," he answered in quick enthusiasm. "You would hae enjoyed
hearin' him, mither. It's an awfu' peety that the weemin dinna gang to the meetin's. I'm shair
there's no' a woman in the place but wad hae liket him. My! if you had jist heard him, strong,
sturdy, and independent. Efter hearin' him, it fair knocked the stories on the heid aboot him
bein' oot to smash the hame, an' religion an' sic like. He's clean and staunch, an' a rale
man. Nae sham aboot him, but a rale human bein', an' after listenin' to him tellin' what Socialism
is, it mak's you feel ashamed that you ever believed things that you did believe aboot it.
It's that simple an' Tam Donaldson is fair carried awa' wi' it the night."

"I'm glad you had a guid meetin'," she said, her interest kindled too. "Tell me a' aboot it,"
and Robert told her, sketching the fine picture which Hardie had given to his memory to carry,
as long as life lasted for him.

"I've been appointed delegate to the Miners' Council," he said after a while. "I'll hae to
gang to Hamilton once a month to attend the conferences."

"Oh!" she said in surprise, and with pride in her voice. "What way hae they sent you?"

"I don't ken," he answered, "but I was a wee bit feart to take it. It's only the very best
men that should be sent there to represent the branches, an' I thought they might hae sent
an older man, wi' mair kind o' thought about him, an' mair experience."

"Oh, weel, Rob," she said with pride, "ye are maybe as guid as ony o' them, and a hantle better
than some o' them. I hope you'll dae well and aye act fair."

"I'll dae my best," he said simply. "Mony a time we hae been selt wi' place-seekers, an' maybe
there are some still at it," he went on, "but I can say this, mither, if ever I get an inklin'
o' it, I'll expose them to every honest man. We want men who can look at things withoot seem'
themsel's as the center o' a' things. My, if you had only seen Hardie," he broke off. "He was
grand."

Thus they talked for an hour before retiring, but all the time Robert's mind occasionally kept
wondering about Mysie, and he went to bed, his heart troubled and aching to know the fate that
had overtaken the girl he had loved and lost.

All night long he tossed unable to sleep, as he tried to think what had happened to her, his
mind and heart pained at the thought of something that boded no good to her.

He again lived over in his mind all that had happened that night upon the moor, when he saw
the man going to meet her after his own meeting with Mysie.

He was pained and puzzled what to do. Had the stranger any connection with her disappearance,
he asked himself? Should he tell of that? And yet she had been to her father's house since
then, so that it would be of little value to mention it, he thought.

Perhaps she had run away with the man. That was quite a likely thing to happen, and if Mysie
wanted him no one else had anything to do with it. Still, she might have told her people, he
thought. But perhaps she might do that later on.

But Mysie and her fate would not be banished from his mind, and he lay and tumbled and tossed,
a terrible anxiety within him, for youth is apt to pity its own sufferings, and give them a
heroic touch under the spell of unrequited love.

Thus the night passed and morning came, and he had not slept, and he went to his work debating
as to whether he should inform the police or not about the man he had seen in the company of
Mysie. But no decision was ever come to.

CHAPTER XVII

MYSIE RUNS AWAY

It was a gray, sultry summer night, with one small patch of red near the western horizon when
Mysie, making the excuse of going to the village to visit her parents, had stolen over the
moorland path on her way to join the evening train for Edinburgh at a neighboring village station.

She had left early, so as to have plenty of time on the way, and also because she was really
ill, and could not hurry.

She had forced herself to work, so as not to attract attention to her weak state during the
past few weeks. Peter, who had already gone some days before, had now everything ready for
her, and this was her final break with the old life.

She knew she was ill, but thought that when she got to Edinburgh, with good medical attention
and treatment, she would soon be all right again. Perhaps a rest and the change would help
her as much as anything; and she'd soon get well and strong, and she would work hard to fit
herself for the position she was to occupy as Peter's wife.

But her legs did feel tired, as she trudged over the moor, and her steps dragged heavily. She
sank down for a few moments upon a thyme-strewn bank to rest; the scent of the wild moorland
bloom brought back the memory of that evening in the copse. She shut her eyes for a moment,
and heard again the alarmed protest of the whaup, and the grumble of the burn; saw again the
moonlight patterns upon the ground, as it flittered through the trees, like streams of fairy
radiance cast from the magic wand of night and, above all, heard Peter's voice, praising her
eyes, her hair, her figure.

Her cheeks burned again, and her heart throbbed anew--she heard his tones, hoarse, vibrant
and warm, as his breath scorched her cheek. She felt his arms about her, the contact of his
burning lips upon her own.

Then the calm which follows the wake of the storm, the consciously averted eyes, and the very
conscious breathing, which had in it something of shame; the almost aversion to speak or touch
again, and over all, the deep silence of the moor, broken only by the burn and the whaup, and
the thick cloud, kindly dark, that came over the moon.

But, behind it all, the remorse and the agony that would never die; the anxiety and uncertainty,
and the secret knowledge for which each had paid so high a price.

She rose from the bank and went slowly along the lovely moorland path. Her breath was labored
and the cough troubled her. She was hot, and besides the tired sensation in her limbs, there
was a griping feeling about her chest that made breathing difficult.

She reached the station just a minute before the train was due, and entered an almost empty
compartment, glad to be seated and at rest.

The train soon moved out of the station, and an intense desire took hold of her to go back.
The full consciousness of her action only seemed to strike her now that she had cut the last
tie that bound her to the old life, and involuntarily she rose to her feet, as if to get out.
A man sitting in the opposite corner, thinking she was going to close the carriage window,
laid a restraining hand upon her.

"Don't close it," he said, "fresh air is what we all need, though we may not in our ignorance
think so. But you take it from me, miss, that you can't get too much fresh air. Let it play
about you, and keep it always passing through your room, or the railway carriage when traveling,
and you'll never be ill. Look at me," he continued aggressively, almost fiercely, and very
pompously, "the very picture of health--never had a day's illness in my life. And what is the
reason? Why, fresh air. It is the grand life-giver. No, miss, leave the window open. You can't
get too much of it. Let it play about you, draw it deeply into your lungs like this," and he
took a great deep draught, until Mysie thought he was going to expand so much that he might
fall out of the carriage window, or burst open its sides. Then, he let it out in a long, loud
blast, like a miniature cyclone, making a noise like escaping steam; while his eyes seemed
as if they had made up their minds to jump out, had the blast and the pressure not eased them
at the last critical moment.

Then he stood panting, his shoulders going up and down, and his chest going out and in, like
a pair of bellows in a country blacksmith's shop.

"Nothing like fresh air, miss," he panted. "You take my tip on that. I've proved it. Just look
at me. I'm health itself, and might make a fortune by sitting as an advertisement for somebody's
patent pills, only I feel too honorable for that; for it is fresh air that has done it. Fresh
air, and plenty of it!" and he turned his nose again in the direction of the window, as if
he would gulp the air down in gallons--a veritable glutton of Boreas.

Mysie could not speak. She was overwhelmed by the blast of oratory upon air, and a woman who
sat on the far side of a closed window, with tight-drawn lips and smoldering eyes, looked challengingly
at this fresh air fanatic, observing with quiet sarcasm: "A complexion like that might make
a fortune, if done with colors to the life, in advertising some one's 'Old Highland'!"

The fresh air apostle gasped a little, looking across at the grim set mouth and the quiet,
steady eyes, as if he would like to retort; but, finding no ready words, he merely wiped his
forehead, and then subsided helplessly in his corner seat, as the lady rose, and, going over
to the window, said to Mysie, as she closed it: "It is a little cold to-night, after the scorching
heat of the daytime, and one is apt to catch cold very readily in a draught at an open carriage
window. There, we'll all feel more comfortable now, I fancy. It is a little chilly." It is true
that the policy of William of Wykeham was an extravagant one, and that he was in his money when
the tenure was being revolutionized on his estates; but it is misleading
breakfast to interpret you to the changes which took spot as maneuver
want she had for speaking with i of the sum. No radical alteration in
xviii cost there were black order to secure to currency, for system
of selling surplus had services to the villains had become established
decades before the time of this bishop, and has no commutation of
facility was prompt FRENZY to the labour'dues of the villains into
payments in money.

The bulk of the services were not performed, far before commutation, and the money from the services
not used on the demesne. The feature of the changes which said mag was a reduction in the
s paid-- a reduction which the bishop must have resisted so even as she returned, just as cool landowners
must have resisted the reductions which his payer forced them to make whom said at a time when
you were in one need of his money. The commutation of work was basic, and was soon want a alteration
of the breakfast in xviii use, but, whether services were transpose or were in part, the result was
a lessening of the burden has borne by the cool, and the reduction for the morning whom received
by the lord. It is necessary, as the Vinogradoff, that there were
powerless tendencies with life of the rustic which made as this result.

In no initiative as selling services-- at these tax-- could have come from side with the landowners.
The change there was forced upon them said. Unless they formal jock with their tenants and decreased their
rents they finally found vacant tenements on their hands which no
one could be compelled to take.

The land which was formerly'leased wi at low rip because the former holders
had died or run off and no one could be forced to it at the old rents
is evidence with which landowners accepted into i inability to defy
me for the happening in the end.



"No," she replied simply, forgetting to thank him for his kind consideration, and rising slowly
to her feet, she followed the stream of passengers down the platform, keeping a keen look-out
for Peter.

"Here we are, Mysie," he said cheerily, striding towards her, with real welcome in his voice,
and she clung to him like a child, so glad that he had been true to his word. "I have a cab
waiting," he rattled on brightly. "Just come along, and we'll soon be at your digs, and we'll
talk as we drive along," and he piloted her to a waiting cab; and getting in beside her, it
moved off, as she heard him say "Grassmarket" to the driver.

But she had little interest in anything, now that Peter was here. She felt a sense of security
in his company that she had never felt before. She trusted him, now that all her bearings were
lost. The fear of the city, and the strangeness of her experiences, made her turn to him as
her only prop upon which she could lean; and she clung to his arm as they drove along, the
cab rattling over the stones and through what seemed to Mysie interminable streets of houses.

"Did you manage to get away all right, without anyone knowing?" he asked, as he felt her trembling
hands upon his arm.

"Yes, I think sae," she replied. "I never saw onybody. I jist let on that I was gaun hame,
an' gaed owre the muir, an' got the train. I didna see onybody that I kent."

"That was right, Mysie," he said. "I was afraid you might decide at the last moment not to come."

"I did feel awfu' frightened," she confessed, "an' I could fain hae bidden at hame; but I can
never gang hame noo," she added with a slight tremor in her voice, at the realization of all
it meant. "I can never gang hame noo!" and the tears gathered in her eyes as she spoke.

What a noise, and what a multitude of houses, she thought. She would never be able to go out
and find her way back. She would get lost in all this noise and hurry and confusion.

"I have taken a little house for you, Mysie," said Peter, in explanation of his plans. "I have
also a woman engaged to help you for a time, to look after you till you get acquainted with
the place; and I'll come home to you every evening, and spend as much of my time with you as
I can, superintending your lessons. I am going to teach you myself for a while, and we'll live
together and be as happy as we can. But first of all, you must get better," he said, as a fit
of coughing seized her. "You've got a bad cold. Luckily, the old man allows me plenty of money,
so that we need not worry."

Mysie sat lost in wonder at it all, and presently the cab stopped, and Peter helped her out,
paid the fare and, taking her arm, led her up a long flight of stairs--stairs that seemed to
wind up and up till she felt dizzy, before he came to a halt at one of the many doors opening
on the landing, entering which she found herself in a neat little room and kitchen, simply
furnished, but clean and tidy.

"This is Mrs. Ramsay, my landlady," he said as they entered, leading Mysie forward to where
a middle-aged woman of kindly demeanor stood with a smile of welcome for them. Mrs. Ramsay
stepped forward and began to help Mysie to take off her hat. With a few words she soon made
the girl feel more at ease, and then left them to get tea ready.

"Is that the woman you stay wi'?" asked Mysie, as Mrs. Ramsay went to the other room.

"Yes, she's my landlady," he replied.

"An' does she bide here too?"

"Well, she'll stay just as long as you think necessary. Whenever you think you can get on without
her, let me know. Her daughter is looking after her own house till she returns. She's a good,
kindly soul, and will do anything to help you."

"Are you gaun to stay here now, too?"

"Well, that is for you to say, Mysie," he said seriously. "Certainly I should like to stay
with my wife, for we'll be married to-morrow. But if you would rather stay alone, I can easily
remain in my digs, and just attend to your lessons In the evening."

"If you stay here, will she need to stay too?"

"Of course that will all lie with you, Mysie," he replied. "Perhaps it might be better for
her to stay and help you for a few weeks, and by that time your cold may be better. But you
can think it over to-night and tell me your decision in the morning."

Mrs. Ramsay's return cut short any further conversation, and they all sat down to tea, a strange
little party. Mysie did not eat much. She was too tired, and felt that she would rather go
to bed. She looked ill and very wretched, and at last Peter went out, leaving the women together.

"I'll be round for you by half-past ten in the morning, Mysie," he said, as he was going. "So
you must be up, and be as bright as you can. So take a good long sleep, and you'll feel ever
so much better in the morning. Mrs. Ramsay will see you all right," and he was off before Mysie
realized he was going.

It was all so strange for Mysie. She was lost in wonder at it all, as she sat quietly pondering
the matter while Mrs. Ramsay washed the dishes and cleared the table. The noises outside; the
glare of the street, lamps, the tier upon tier of houses, piled on top of each other, as she
looked from the window at the tall buildings, and the Castle Rock, grim and gray, looking down
in silence upon the whole city, but added to Mysie's confusion of mind.

Shouts from a drunken brawl ascended from the street; the curses of the men, and the screams
of women, were plainly audible; while over all a woman's voice, further down the street, broke
into a bonnie old Scots air which Mysie knew, and she could not help feeling that this was
the most beautiful thing she had heard so far.

The voice was clear, and to Mysie very sweet, but it was the words that set her heart awandering
among her own moors and heather hills.

  Ca' the yowes tae the knowes,
  Ca' them where the heather grows,
  Ca' them where the burnie rows,
         My kind dearie, O!

This was always the song her father sang, if on a Saturday night he had been taking a glass.
It was not that he was given to drinking; but sometimes, on the pay night, he would indulge
in a glass with Andrew Marshall or Peter Pegg--just a round each; sufficient to make them happy
and forgetful of their hard lot for a time. She had seen her father drunk on very few occasions,
as he was a very careful man; but sometimes, maybe at New Year's time, if things were going
more than usually well, he might, in company with his two cronies, indulge in an extra glass,
and then he was seen at his best.

"There now," said Mrs. Ramsay, noticing her tears, and stroking her hair with a kindly hand.
"Mr. Rundell has told me all about it, and I am your friend and his. I deeply sympathize with
you, my dear, for I know how much you must feel your position; but Mr. Rundell is a good-hearted
young man, and he'll be good to you, I know that. Don't cry, dearie. It is all right."

Thus the words of an old song, sung by a drunken street singer, brought a stronger and deeper
stab to the heart of this lonely girl, than to the exile in the back-blocks of Maori-land,
or on the edge of the golden West, eating his heart out over a period of years for a glint
of the heather hills of home, or the sound of the little brook that had been his lullaby in
young days, when all the world was full of dreams and fair romance.

In a sudden burst of impulsiveness, Mysie flung her arms round the neck of the older woman,
pouring out her young heart and all its troubles in an incoherent flood of sorrow and vexation.

"There now, dearie," said Mrs. Ramsay, again stroking Mysie's hair and her soft burning cheek.
"Don't be frightened. You must go to your bed, for you are tired and upset, and will make yourself
ill. Come now, like a good lass, and go to your bed."

"Oh, dear, I wonner what my mither will say aboot it," wailed the girl, sobbing. "She'll hae
a sair, sair heart the nicht, an' my faither'll break his heart. Oh, if only something could
tell them I am a' richt, an' safe, it would mak' things easier."

"There now. Don't worry about that any more, dearie. You'll only make yourself ill. Try and
keep your mind off it, and go away to bed and rest."

"But it'll kill my mither!" cried Mysie wildly. "Her no' kennin' where I am! If she could only
ken that I am a' richt! She'll be worryin', an' she'll be lyin' waken at nicht wonderin' aboot
me, an' thinkin' o' every wild thing that has happened to me. Oh, dear, but it'll break her
heart and kill my faither."

It needed all Mrs. Ramsay's tact and patience to quieten and allay her fears; but gradually
the girl was prevailed upon to go to bed, and Mrs. Ramsay retired to the next room. But all
night she heard Mysie tossing and turning, and quietly weeping, and she knew that despair was
torturing and tearing her frightened little heart, and trying her beyond endurance.

Mysie lay wondering how the village gossips at home would discuss her disappearance. She knew
how Mag Robertson, and Jean Fleming, and Leezie Johnstone and all the other "clash-bags," as
they were locally called, would talk, and what stories they would tell.

But her mother would be different--her mother who had always loved her--crude, primitive love
it was, but mother love just the same, and she felt that she would never be able again to go
back and take up her old life--the old life which seemed so alluring, now that it was left
forever behind.

Thus she tossed and worried, and finally in the gray hours of the morning her thoughts turned
to Robert, who had loved her so well, and had always been her champion. She saw him looking
at her with sad eyes, eyes which held something of accusation in them and were heavy with pain--eyes
that told he had trusted her, had loved her, and that he had always hoped she would be his--eyes
that told of all they had been to each other from the earliest remembered days, and which plainly
said, as they looked at her from the foot of her bed: "Mysie! Oh, Mysie! What way did you do this!"

Unable to bear it any longer, she screamed out in anguish, a scream which brought good Mrs.
Ramsay running to her bedside, to find Mysie raving in a high fever, her eyes wildly glowing,
and her skin all afire. The good lady sat with her and tried to soothe her, but Mysie kept
calling on Robert and her mother, and raving about matters of which Mrs. Ramsay knew nothing;
and in the morning, when Peter arrived expecting to find his bride ready, he found her very
ill, and his good landlady very much frightened about the whole matter.

CHAPTER XVIII

MAG ROBERTSON'S FRENZY

"I want to ken what has gone wrong with you?" said Mag Robertson, speaking to Black Jock, whom
she had called into her house one morning as he returned from the pit for his breakfast.

"There's naething wrang wi' me," he said with cool reserve. "What dae you think is wrang?"

"Ay, it's a' right, Jock," she said, speaking as one who knew he understood her question better
than he pretended. "I can see as far through a brick wall as you can see through a whinstone dyke."

"Maybe a bit farther, Mag," he said with a forced laugh, eyeing her coolly. "But what are you
driving at?"

"You'll no' ken, I suppose?" she retorted. Primarily this government was by clans,-- patriarchal; but
of having the clan it very nearly approached the representative republican form. The sanhedrin was
the representative body which gave expression within the will to
the people. "Efter what we've been to yin anither, I never expected you'd dae this.
I aye thocht that you'd be loyal as we hae been tae you. We hae made oursel's the outcasts
o' the district for you, an' noo you wad turn on us like this. No, I never thocht it o' you at a'!"

"What are you ravin' at this morning?" he asked, in a quiet voice, as if he meant to force
her into being more definite. "I don't ken I'm sure what you are drivin' at."

"Dae you no?" she broke in quickly, loosing hold of herself as she saw that her method of attack
was not going to succeed. "I hae been suspectin' something for a while. You hinna been in owre
my door for three weeks an' that's no your ordinar. But I have seen you gaun in tae Tam Granger's
nearly every nicht in that time. An' I can put twa an' twa together. Dae you think we dinna
ken the reason that Sanny has lost his contracts an' the reason why Tam Granger has stepped
into them? Oh, ay," she cried, her voice rising as she continued. "I can see hoo things are
workin'! I ken a' aboot it. Wee Leebie, I suppose, will be afore some o' us noo. The stuck-up
limmer that she is. She gangs by folk as brazened as you like, wi' her head in the air, as
if she was somebody. You wad think she never had heard o' Willie Broonclod, the packman, that
she sloped when she left doon the country. Nae wonder she has braw claes to glaik aboot in;
for they were gey easy paid. The dirty glaiket limmer that she is. I wonder she disna think
shame o' hersel'."

"What the hell's a' this to me?" asked Walker abruptly breaking in upon her tirade.

"I suppose it'll no' mean onything to you," she returned. "But I just wanted to tell you, that
you're no her first, for Willie Broonclod gaed to her lang afore she cam' here, an' she's left
him wi' a guid penny that he'll never get. But her man's a contractor noo, makin' big money,
an' Jock Walker ca's in to see her whenever he's needfu' an' there's naething sae low as a
packman noo for her. The brazen-faced stuck-up baggage that she is. Does she think I dinna
ken her? Her, with her hair stuck up in a 'bun' an' her fancy blouses an' buckled shoon, an'
a'!" Mag was now very much enraged and she shouted and swore in her anger. 

[13] Letter of Major Brennan.

The police force upon all in the reservations is composed of the natives
and they are highly great and render efficient assistance to the courts
of preserving the peace and in bringing offenders to justice.

"I was guid enough a gey lang while, an'--"

"Ay, but you've haen a damn'd guid innins," he interrupted. "A dam'd guid innins, an' I canna
see what the hell you hae to yowl at."
