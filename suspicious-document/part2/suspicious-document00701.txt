JAN OF THE WINDMILL.

So the windmiller might have said, if he had been in the habit of putting his thoughts into
an epigrammatic form, as a groan from his wife and a growl of thunder broke simultaneously
upon his ear, whilst the rain fell scarcely faster than her tears.

It was far from mending matters that both storms were equally unexpected.  For eight full years
the miller's wife had been the meekest of women.  If there was a firm (and yet, as he flattered
himself, a just) husband in all the dreary straggling district, the miller was that man.  And
he always did justice to his wife's good qualities,--at least to her good quality of submission,--and
would, till lately, have upheld her before any one as a model of domestic obedience.  From
the day when he brought home his bride, tall, pretty, and perpetually smiling, to the tall
old mill and the ugly old mother who never smiled at all, there had been but one will in the
household.  At any rate, after the old woman's death.  For during her life-time her stern son
paid her such deference that it was a moot point, perhaps, which of them really ruled.  Between
them, however, the young wife was moulded to a nicety, and her voice gained no more weight
in the counsels of the windmill when the harsh tones of the mother-in-law were silenced for ever.

The miller was one of those good souls who live by the light of a few small shrewdities (often
proverbial), and pique themselves on sticking to them to such a point, as if it were the greater
virtue to abide by a narrow rule the less it applied.  The kernel of his domestic theory was,
"Never yield, and you never will have to," and to this he was proud of having stuck against
all temptations from a real, though hard, affection for his own; and now, after working so
smoothly for eight years, had it come to this?

The miller scratched his bead, and looked at his wife, almost with amazement.  She moaned,
though he bade her be silent; she wept, in spite of words which had hitherto been an effectual
styptic to her tears; and she met the commonplaces of his common sense with such wild, miserable
laughter, that he shuddered as he heard her.

Weakness in human beings is like the strength of beasts, a power of which fortunately they
are not always conscious.  Unless positively brutal, you cannot well beat a sickly woman for
wailing and weeping; and if she will not cease for any lesser consideration, there seems nothing
for an unbending husband to do but to leave her to herself.

This the miller had to do, anyhow.  For he could only spare a moment's attention to her now
and then, since the mill required all his care.

In a coat and hat of painted canvas, he had been in and out ever since the storm began; now
directing the two men who were working within, now struggling along the stage that ran outside
the windmill, at no small risk of being fairly blown away.

He had reefed the sails twice already in the teeth of the blinding rain.  But he did well to
be careful.  For it was in such a storm as this, five years ago "come Michaelmas," that the
worst of windmill calamities had befallen him,--the sails had been torn off his mill and dashed
into a hundred fragments upon the ground.  And such a mishap to a seventy feet tower mill means--as
windmillers well know- -not only a stoppage of trade, but an expense of two hundred pounds
for the new sails.

Many a sack of grist, which should have come to him had gone down to the watermill in the valley
before the new sails were at work; and the huge debt incurred to pay for them was not fairly
wiped out yet. That catastrophe had kept the windmiller a poor man for five years, and it gave
him a nervous dread of storms.

And talking of storms, here was another unreasonable thing.  The morning sky had been (like
the miller's wedded life) without a cloud.  The day had been sultry, for the time of year unseasonably
so.  And, just when the miller most grudged an idle day, when times were hard, when he was
in debt,--for some small matters, as well as the sail business,--and when, for the first time
in his life, he felt almost afraid of his own hearthstone, and would fain have been busy at
his trade, not a breath of wind had there been to turn the sails of the mill.  Not a waft to
cool his perplexed forehead, not breeze enough to stir the short grass that glared for miles
over country flat enough to mock him with the fullest possible view of the cloudless sky. 
Then towards evening, a few gray flecks had stolen up from the horizon like thieves in the
dusk, and a mighty host of clouds had followed them; and when the wind did come, it came in
no moderate measure, but brought this awful storm upon its wings, which now raged as if all
the powers of mischief had got loose, and were bent on turning every thing topsy-turvy indoors
and out.

What made the winds and clouds so perverse, the clerk of the weather best knows; but there
was a reason for the unreasonableness of the windmiller's wife.

She had lost her child, her youngest born, and therefore, at present, her best beloved.  This
girl-babe was the sixth of the windmiller and his wife's children, the last that God gave them,
and the first that it had pleased Him to take away.

The mother had been weak herself at the time that the baby fell ill, and unusually ill-fitted
to bear a heavy blow.  Then her watchful eyes had seen symptoms of ailing in the child long
before the windmiller's good sense would allow a fuss to be made, and expense to be incurred
about a little peevishness up or down.  And it was some words muttered by the doctor when he
did come, about not having been sent for soon enough, which were now doing as much as any thing
to drive the poor woman frantic.  They struck a blow, too, at her blind belief in the miller's
invariable wisdom.  If he had but listened to her in this matter, were it only for love's sake!
There was something, she thought, in what that woman had said who came to help her with the
last offices,--the miller discouraged "neighbors," but this was a matter of decency,--that
it was as foolish for a man to have the say over babies and housework as it would be for his
wife to want her word in the workshop or the mill.

Perhaps a state of subjection for grown-up people does not tend to make them reasonable, especially
in their indignations.  The windmiller's wife dared not, for her life, have told him in so
many words that she thought it would be for their joint benefit if he would give a little more
consideration to her wishes and opinions; but from this suppressed idea came many sharp and
peevish words at this time, which, apart from their true source, were quite as unreasonable
and perverse as the miller held them to be.  Nor is being completely under the control of another,
self-control.  It may be doubted if it can even do much to teach it.  The thread of her passive
condition having been, for the time, broken by grief, the bereaved mother moaned and wailed,
and rocked herself, and beat her breast, and turned fiercely upon all interference, like some
poor beast in anguish.

She had clung to her children with an almost morbid tenderness, in proportion as she found
her worthy husband stern and cold.  A hard husband sometimes makes a soft mother, and it is
perhaps upon the baby of the family that her repressed affections outpoured themselves most
fully.  It was so in this case, at any rate.  And the little one had that unearthly beauty
which is seen, or imagined, about children who die young.  And the poor woman had suffered
and striven so for it, to have it and to keep it.  The more critical grew its illness, the
intenser grew her strength and resolution by watchfulness, by every means her instinct and
experience could suggest, to fight and win the battle against death.  And when all was vain,
the maddening thought tortured her that it might have been saved.

The miller had made a mistake, and it was a pity that he made another on the top of it, with
the best intentions.  He hurried on the funeral, hoping that when "all was over" the mother
would "settle down."

But it was this crowning insult to her agony, the shortening of the too brief time when she
could watch by all that remained to her of her child, which drove her completely wild.  She
reproached him now plainly and bitterly enough.  She would neither listen to reason nor obey;
and when--with more truth than taste--he observed that other people lost children, and that
they had plenty left, she laughed in his face that wild laugh which drove him back to the mill
and to the storm.

How it raged!  The miller's wife was an uneducated, commonplace woman enough, but, in the excited
state of her nervous system, she was as sensible as any poet of a kind of comforting harmony
in the wild sounds without; though at another time they would have frightened her.

They did not disturb the children, who were in bed.  Four in the old press-bed in the corner,
and one in a battered crib, and one in the narrow bed over which the coverlet was not yet green.

The day's work was over for her, though it was only just beginning for the miller, and the
mother had nothing to do but weep, and her tears fell and fell, and the rain poured and poured.
That last outburst had somewhat relieved her, and she almost wished her husband would come
back, as a flash of lightning dazzled her eyes, and the thunder rattled round the old mill,
as if the sails had broken up again, and were falling upon the roof of the round-house. All
her senses were acute to-night, and she listened for the miller's footsteps, and so, listening,
in the lull after the thunder, she heard another sound.  Wheels upon the road.

A pang shot through her heart.  Thus had the doctor's gig sounded the night he came,--alas,
too late!  How long and how intensely she had listened for that!  She first heard it just beyond
the mile- stone.  This one must be a good bit on this side of it; up the hill, in fact.  She
could not help listening.  It was so like, so terribly like!  Now it spun along the level ground.
Ah, the doctor had not hurried so!  Now it was at the mill, at the door, and--it stopped.

The miller's wife rose to run out, she hardly knew why. Force if it got he was closed about neighbors

  Near the door which led from this
into the round-house was the ladder leading to the next story, and close by that the opening
through which the sacks of grain were drawn up above.  The story above the basement held the
millstones and the "smutting" machine, for cleaning dirty wheat.  The next above that held
the dressing machine, in which the bran was separated from the flour.  In the next above that
were the corn-bins.  To the next above that the grain was drawn up from the basement in the
first instance.  The top story of all held the machinery connected with the turning of the
sails.  Ladders led from story to story, and each room had two windows on opposite sides of
the mill.

Use is second nature, and all the sounds which haunt a windmill were soon as familiar and as
pleasant to the little Jan as if he had been born a windmiller's son.  Through many a windy
night he slept as soundly as a sailor in a breeze which might disturb the nerves of a land-lubber.
And when the north wind blew keen and steadily, and the chains jangled as the sacks of grist
went upwards, and the millstones ground their monotonous music above his head, these sounds
were only as a lullaby to his slumbers, and disturbed him no more than they troubled his foster-mother,
to whom the revolving stones ground out a homely and welcome measure:  "Dai-ly bread, dai-
ly bread, dai-ly bread."

For another sign of his being a true child of the mill, his nurse Abel anxiously watched.

Though Abel preferred nursing to pig-minding, he had a higher ambition yet, which was to begin
his career as a windmiller.  It was not likely that he could be of use to his father for a
year or two, and the fact that he was of very great use to his mother naturally tended to delay
his promotion to the mill.

Mrs. Lake was never allowed to say no to her husband, and she seemed to be unable, and was
certainly unwilling, to say it to her children. I become satisfy with Winter, and to understand
favour in her ways, handle himself as the foe done of her dame. She pointed out to he her giddy
Iodine, who, i were unwittingly already-announced by speech, had respectively the imperfection
to wish how him, and could not receive make young hecatomb for him.
The pate, the lover, a Iodine who presume were in forsaken unison with
the rival about nothing to play, and i obtained to my wish the assurance
of the laid one, who give me have however all the I has authorise.

The ancestor of the charming costume had introduce me to give his debts; and if she can him forbear
an interrogation with him was for me, she might plan i on being necessitate with the result
of the first.


It was a great and important time to Abel when Jan learned to walk; but, as he was neither
precocious nor behindhand in this respect, his biographer may be pardoned for not dwelling
on it at any length.

He had a charming demure little face, chiefly differing from the faces of the other children
of the district by an overwhelming superiority in the matter of forehead.

Mrs. Lake had had great hopes that he would differ in another respect also.

Most of the children of the neighborhood were fair.  Not fair as so many North-country children
are, with locks of differing, but equally brilliant, shades of gold, auburn, red, and bronze;
but white-headed, and often white-faced, with white-lashed inexpressive eyes, as if they had
been bleaching through several generations.

Now, when the dark bright eyes of the little Jan first came to be of tender interest with Mrs.
Lake, she fully hoped, and constantly prophesied, that he would be "as black as a rook;" a
style of complexion to which she gave a distinct preference, though the miller was fair by
nature as well as white by trade.  Jan's eyes seemed conclusive.

"Black as slans they be," said his foster-mother.  And slans meant sloe-berries where Mrs.
Lake was born.

An old local saying had something perhaps to do with her views:  -

     "Lang and lazy,
        Black and proud;
      Vair and voolish,
        Little and loud."

"Fair and foolish" youngsters certainly abounded in the neighborhood to an extent which justified
a wish for a change.

As to pride, meek Mrs. Lake was far from regarding it as a failing in those who had any thing
to be proud of, such as black hair and a possible connection with the gentry.  And fate having
denied to her any chance of being proud or aggressive on her own account, she derived a curious
sort of second-hand satisfaction from seeing these qualities in those who belonged to her.
It did to some extent console her for the miller's roughness to herself, to hear him rating
George.  And she got a sort of reflected dignity out of being able to say, "My maester's a
man as will have his way."

But her hopes were not realized.  That yellow into which the beefsteak stage of Jan's infant
complexion had faded was not destined to deepen into gipsy hues.  It gave place to the tints
of the China rose, and all the wind and sunshine on the downs could not tan, though they sometimes
burnt, his cheeks.  The hair on his little head became more abundant, but it kept its golden
hue.  His eyes remained dark,--a curious mixture; for as to hair and complexion he was irredeemably
fair.

The mill had at least one "vair and voolish" inmate, by common account, though by his own (given
in confidence to intimate friends) he was "not zuch a vool as he looked."

This was George Sannel, the miller's man.

Master Lake had had a second hand in to help on that stormy night when Jan made his first appearance
at the mill; but as a rule he only kept one man, whom he hired for a year at a time, at the
mop or hiring fair held yearly in the next town.

George, or Gearge as he was commonly called, had been more than two years in the windmill,
and was looked upon in all respects as "one of the family."  He slept on a truckle-bed in the
round-house, which, though of average size, would not permit him to stretch his legs too recklessly
without exposing his feet to the cold.

For "Gearge" was six feet one and three-quarters in his stockings.

  But,
when days and weeks went by, and he wandered unmolested from floor to floor, with many a kindly
word from George, and not a single cuff or nip, the sweet-tempered Abel began to feel gratitude,
and almost an affection, for his quondam tormentor.

George, for his part, had hitherto done some violence to his own feelings by his constant refusal
to allow Abel to help him to sweep the mill or couple the sacks for lifting.  He would have
been only too glad to put some of his own work on the shoulders of another, had it not been
for the vexatious thought that he would be giving pleasure by so doing where he only wanted
to annoy.  And in his very unamiable disposition malice was a stronger quality even than idleness.

But now, when for some reason best known to himself, he wished to win Abel's regard, it was
a slight recompense to him for restraining his love of tormenting that he got a good deal of
work out of Abel at odd moments when the miller was away.  So well did he manage this, that
a marked improvement in the tidiness of the round-house drew some praise from his master.

"Thee'll be a sprack man yet, Gearge," said the windmiller, encouragingly.  "Thee takes the
broom into the corners now."

"So I do," said George, unblushingly, "so I do.  But lor, Master Lake, what a man you be to
notice un!"  George's kinder demeanor towards Abel began shortly after the coming of the little
Jan, and George himself accounted for it in the following manner:  -

"You do be kind to me now, Gearge," said Abel, gratefully, as he stood one day, with the baby
in his arms, watching the miller's man emptying a sack of grain into the hopper.

"I likes to see thee with that babby, Abel," said George, pausing in his work.  "Thee's a good
boy, Abel, and careful.  I likes to do any thing for thee, Abel."

"I wish I could do any thing for thee, Gearge," said Abel; "but I be too small to help the
likes of you, Gearge."

"If you're small, you're sprack," said the miller's man.  "Thee's a good scholar, too, Abel.
I'll be bound thee can read, now?  And a poor gawney like I doesn't know's letters."

"I can read a bit, Gearge," said Abel, with pride; "but I've been at home a goodish while;
but mother says she'll send I to school again in spring, if the little un gets on well and walks."

"I wish I could read," said George, mournfully; "but time's past for me to go to school, Abel;
and who'd teach a great lummakin vool like I his letters?"

"I would, Gearge, I would!" cried Abel, his eyes sparkling with earnestness.  "I can teach
thee thy letters, and by the time thee's learned all I know, maybe I'll have been to school
again, and learned some more."

This was the foundation of a curious kind of friendship between Abel and the miller's man.

On the same shelf with the "Vamly Bible," before alluded to, was a real old horn-book, which
had belonged to the windmiller's grandmother.  It was simply a sheet on which the letters of
the alphabet, and some few words of one syllable, were printed, and it was protected in its
frame by a transparent front of thin horn, through which the letters could be read, just as
one sees the prints through the ground-glass of "drawing slates."

From this horn-book Abel labored patiently in teaching George his letters.  It was no light
task.  George had all the cunning and shrewdness with which he credited himself; but a denser
head for any intellectual effort could hardly have been found for the seeking. Still they struggled
on, and as George went about the mill he might have been heard muttering, -

"A B C G.  No!  Cuss me for a vool!  A B C D.  Why didn't they whop my letters into I when
a was a boy?  A B C"--and so persevering with an industry which he commonly kept for works
of mischief.

One evening he brought home a newspaper from the Heart of Oak, and when Mrs. Lake had taken
the baby, he persuaded Abel to come into the round-house and give him a lesson.  Abel could
read so much of it that George was quite overwhelmed by his learning.

"Thee be's mortal larned, Abel, sartinly.  But I'll never read like thee," he added, despairingly.
"Drattle th' old witch; why didn't she give I some schooling?"  He spoke with spiteful emphasis,
and Abel, too well used to his rough language to notice the uncivil reference to his mother,
said with some compassion, -

"Were you never sent to school then, Gearge?"

"They should ha' kept me there," said George, self-defensively.  "I played moocher," he continued,--by
which he meant truant,--"and then they whopped I, and a went home to mother, and she kept un
at home, the old vool!"

"Well, Gearge, thee must work hard, and I'll teach thee, Gearge, I'll teach thee!" said little
Abel, proudly.  "And by-and-by, Gearge, we'll get a slate, and I'll teach thee to write too,
Gearge, that I will!"

George's small eyes gave a slight squint, as they were apt to do when he was thinking profoundly.

"Abel," said he, "can thee read writing, my boy?"

"I think I could, Gearge," said Abel, "if 'twas pretty plain."

"Abel, my boy," said George, after a pause, with a broad sweet smile upon his "voolish" face,
"go to the door and see if the wind be rising at all; us mustn't forget th' old mill, Abel,
with us larning.  Sartinly not, Abel, mun."

Proud of the implied partnership in the care of the mill, Abel hastened to the outer door.
As he passed the inner one, leading into the dwelling-room, he could hear his mother crooning
a strange, drony, old local ditty, as she put the little Jan to sleep.  As Abel went out, she
was singing the first verse:  -

     "The swallow twitters on the barn,
      The rook is cawing on the tree,
      And in the wood the ringdove coos,
      But my false love hath fled from me."

Abel opened the door, and looked out.  One of those small white moths known as "millers" went
past him.  The night was still,--so utterly still that no sound of any sort whatever broke
upon the ear. In dead silence and loneliness stood the mill.  Even the miller-moth had gone;
and a cat ran in by Abel's legs, as if the loneliness without were too much for her.  The sky
was gray.

Abel went back to the round-house, where George was struggling to fix the candlestick securely
in the wall.

"Cuss the thing!" he exclaimed, whilst the skin of his face took a mottled hue that was the
nearest approach he ever made to a blush. "The tallow've been a dropping, Abel, my boy.  I
think 'twas the wind when you opened the door, maybe.  And I've been a trying to fix un more
firmly.  That's all, Abel; that's all."

"There ain't no signs of wind," said Abel.  "It's main quiet and unked too outside, Gearge.
And I do think it be like rain.  There was a miller-moth, Gearge; do that mean any thing?"

"I can't say," said George.  "I bean't weatherwise myself, Abel. But if there be no wind, there
be no work, Abel; so us may go back to our larning.  Look here, my boy," he added, as Abel
reseated himself on the grain-sack which did duty as chair of instruction, and drawing, as
he spoke, a letter forth to the light; "come to the candle, Abel, and see if so be thee can
read this, but don't tell any one I showed it thee, Abel."

"Not me, Gearge," said Abel, warmly; and he added,--"Be it from thy young 'ooman, Gearge?"

No rustic swain ever simpered more consciously or looked more foolish than George under this
accusation, as he said, "Be quiet, Abel, do 'ee."

"She be a good scholar, too!" said Abel, looking admiringly at the closely written sheet.

George could hardly disguise the sudden look of fury in his face, but he hastily covered up
the letter with his hands in such a manner as only to leave the first word on the page visible.
There was a deeply cunning reason for this clever manoeuvre.  George held himself to be pretty
"cute," and he reckoned that, by only showing one word at a time, he could effectually prevent
any attempt on Abel's part to read the letter himself without giving its contents to George.
Like many other cunning people, George overreached himself.  The first word was beyond Abel's
powers, though he might possibly have satisfied George's curiosity on one essential point,
by deciphering a name or two farther on.  But the clever George concluded that he had boasted
beyond his ability, so he put the letter away.  Abel tried hard at the one word which George
exhibited, and gazed silently at it for some time with a puzzled face.  "Spell it, mun, spell
it!" cried the miller's man, impatiently.  It was a process which he had seen to succeed, when
a long word had puzzled his teacher in the newspaper, before now.

"M O E R, mower; D Y K, dik," said Abel.  But he looked none the wiser for the effort.

"Mower dik!  What be that?" said George, peering at the word. "Do'ee think it be Mower dik, Abel?"

"I be sure," said Abel.

"Or do 'ee think 'tis 'My dear Dick'?" suggested George, anxiously, and with a sort of triumph
in his tone, as if that were quite what he expected.

"No, no.  'Tis an O, Gearge, that second letter.  Besides, twould be My dear Gearge to thee,
thou knows."

Again the look with which the miller's man favored Abel was far from pleasant. If have ridicule at men,

She was calmed at last, however, and the windmiller took her once more into his arms, and Mrs.
Lake carrying Jan, they all climbed up the narrow ladder to the next floor.

Heavily ground the huge stones with a hundred and twenty revolutions a minute, making the chamber
shake as they went round.

They made the nurse giddy.  The simplest machinery has a bewildering effect upon an unaccustomed
person.  So has going up a ladder; which makes you feel much less safe in the place to which
it leads you than if you had got there by a proper flight of stairs.  So--very often--has finding
yourself face to face with the accomplishment of what you have been striving for, if you happen
to be weak-minded.

Under the combined influences of all these causes, the nurse listened nervously to Master Lake,
as he did the honors of the mill.

"Those be the mill-stones, ma'am.  Pretty fastish they grinds, and they goes faster when the
wind's gusty.  Many a good cat they've ground as flat as a pancake from the poor gawney beasts
getting into the hopper."

"Oh, sir!" cried the nurse, now thoroughly alarmed, "give me the young lady back again.  Deary,
deary me!  I'd no notion it was so dangerous.  Oh, don't, sir! don't!"

"Tut, tut!  I'll hold un safe, ma'am," said the windmiller, who had all a man's dislike for
shirking at the last moment what had once been decided upon; and, as the nurse afterwards expressed
it, before she had time to scream, he had tucked Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby's finery well round
her, and had dipped her into the hopper and out again.

In that moment of suspense both the women had been silent, and the little Jan had gazed steadily
at the operation.  As it safely ended, they both broke simultaneously into words.

"You might have knocked me down with a feather, mum!" gasped Mrs. Lake.  "I couldn't look,
mum.  I couldn't have looked to save my life.  I turned my back."

"I'd back 'ee allus to do the silliest thing as could be done, missus," said the miller, who
had a pleasant husbandly way of commenting upon his wife's conversation to her disparagement,
when she talked before him.

"As for me, ma'am," the nurse said, "I couldn't take my eyes off the dear child's hood.  But
move,--no thank you, ma'am,--I couldn't have moved hand or foot for a five-pound note, paid
upon the spot."

The baby got well.  Whether the mill charm worked the cure, or whether the fine fresh breezes
of that healthy district made a change for the better in the child's state, could not be proved.

Nor were these the only possible causes of the recovery.

The kind-hearted butler blessed the day when he laid out three and eightpence in a box of the
bone-setter's ointment, to such good purpose.

Lady Louisa's mamma triumphantly hoped that it would be a lesson to her dear daughter never
again to set a London doctor's advice (however expensive) above a mother's (she meant a grandmother's)
experience.

The cook said, "Goose-grease and kitchen physic for her!"

And of course the doctor very properly, as well as modestly, observed that "he had confidently
anticipated permanent beneficial results from a persevering use of the embrocation."

And only to the nurse and the windmiller's family was it known that Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby
had been dipped in the mill-hopper.

After the nurse and baby had left the mill, Mrs. Lake showered extra caresses upon the little
Jan.  It had given her a strange pleasure to see him in contact with the Squire's child.  She
knew enough of the manners and customs, the looks and the intelligence of the children of educated
parents, to be aware that there were "makings" in those who were born heirs to developed intellects,
and the grace that comes of discipline, very different from the "makings" to be found in the
"voolish" descendants of ill-nurtured and uneducated generations.  She had no philosophical--hardly
any reasonable or commendable--thoughts about it.  But she felt that Jan's countenance and
his "ways" justified her first belief that he was "gentry born."

She was proud of his pretty manners.  Indeed, curiously enough, she had recalled her old memories
of nursery etiquette under a first- rate upper nurse in "her young days," to apply them to
the little Jan's training.

Why she had not done this with her own children is a question that cannot perhaps be solved
till we know why so many soldiers, used for, it may be, a quarter of a century to personal
cleanliness as scrupulous as a gentleman's, and to enforced neatness of clothes, rooms, and
general habits, take back to dirt and slovenliness with greediness when they leave the service;
and why many a nurse, whose voice and manners were beyond reproach in her mistress's nursery,
brings up her own children in after life on the village system of bawling, banging, threatening,
cuddling, stuffing, smacking, and coarse language, just as if she had never experienced the
better discipline attainable by gentle firmness and regular habits.

Mrs. Lake had a small satisfaction in Jan's brief and limited intercourse with so genteel a
baby, and after it was all over she amused herself with making him repeat the baby's very genteel
(and as she justly said "uncommon") name.

When Abel came back from school, he resumed his charge, and Mrs. Lake went about other work.
She was busy, and the nurse-boy put Jan to bed himself.  The sandy kitten waited till Jan was
fairly established, so as to receive her comfortably, and then she dropped from the roof of
the press-bed, and he cuddled her into his arms, where she purred like a kettle just beginning
to sing.

Outside, the wind was rising, and, passing more or less through the outer door, it roared in
the round-house; but they were well sheltered in the dwelling-room, and could listen complacently
to the gusts that whirled the sails, and made the heavy stones fly round till they shook the
roof.  Just above the press-bed a candle was stuck in the wall, and the dim light falling through
the gloom upon the children made a scene worthy of the pencil of Rembrandt, that great son
of a windmiller.

When Mrs. Lake found time to come to the corner where the old press- bed stood, the kitten
was asleep, and Jan very nearly so; and by them sat Abel, watching every breath that his foster-brother
drew. And, as he watched, his trustworthy eyes and most sweet smile lighting up a face to which
his forefathers had bequeathed little beauty or intellect, he might have been the guardian
angel of the nameless Jan, scarcely veiled under the likeness of a child.

His mother smiled tenderly back upon him.  He was very dear to her, and not the less so for
his tenderness to Jan.

Then she stooped to kiss her foster-child, who opened his black eyes very wide, and caught
the sleeping kitten round the head, in the fear that it might be taken from him.

"Tell Abel the name of pretty young lady you see today, love," said Mrs. Lake.

But Jan was well aware of his power over the miller's wife, and was apt to indulge in caprice.
So he only shook his head, and cuddled the kitten more tightly than before.

"Tell un, Janny dear.  Tell un, there's a lovey!" said Mrs. Lake. "Who did daddy put in the
hopper?"  But still Jan gazed at nothing in particular with a sly twinkle in his black eyes,
and continued to squeeze poor Sandy to a degree that can have been little less agonizing than
the millstone torture; and obdurate he would probably have remained, but that Abel, bending
over him, said, "Do 'ee tell poor Abel, Jan."

The child fixed his bright eyes steadily on Abel's well-loved face for a few seconds, and then
said quite clearly, in soft, evenly accented syllables, -

"Amabel."

And the sandy kitten, having escaped with its life, crept back into Jan's bosom and purred
itself to rest.

Poor Abel was not fated to get much regular schooling.  He particularly liked learning, but
the interval was all too brief between the time when his mother was able to spare him from
housework and the time when his father began to employ him in the mill.

George got more lazy and stupid, instead of less so, and though in some strange manner he kept
his place, yet when Master Lake had once begun to employ his son, he found that he would get
along but ill without him.

To Jan, Abel's being about the windmill gave the utmost satisfaction.  He played with his younger
foster-brothers and sisters contentedly enough, but his love for Abel, and for being with Abel,
was quite another thing.

Mrs. Lake, too, had no confidence in any one but Abel as a nurse for her darling; the consequence
of which was, that the little Jan was constantly trotting at his foster-brother's heels through
the round- house, attempting valiant escalades on the ladders, and covering himself from head
to foot with flour in the effort to cultivate a miller's thumb.

One day Mrs. Lake, having sent the other children off to school, was bent upon having a thorough
cleaning-out of the dwelling-room, during which process Jan was likely to be in her way; so
she caught him up in her arms and went to seek Abel in the round-house.

She had the less scruple in availing herself of his services, that there was no wind, and business
was not brisk in the windmill.

"Maester!" she cried, "can Abel mind Jan a bit?  I be going to clean the house."

"Ay, ay," said the windmiller, "Abel can mind un.  I be going to the village myself, but there's
Gearge to start, if so be the wind rises.  And then if he want Abel, thee must take the little
un again."

"Sartinly I will," said his wife; and Abel willingly received his charge and carried him off
to play among the sacks.

George joined them once, but Jan had a rooted and unconquerable dislike to the miller's man,
and never replied to his advances with any thing more friendly than anger or tears.  This day
was no exception to others in this respect; and after a few fruitless attempts to make himself
acceptable, in the course of which he trod on the sandy kitten's tail, who ran up Jan's back
and spat at her enemy from that vantage-ground, George went off muttering in terms by no means
complimentary to the little Jan.  Abel did his best to excuse the capricious child to George,
besides chiding him for his rudeness--with very little effect.  Jan dried his black eyes as
the miller's man made off, but he looked no more ashamed of himself than a good dog looks who
has growled or refused the paw of friendship to some one for excellent reasons of his own.

After George had gone, they played about happily enough, Jan riding on Abel's back, and the
sandy kitten on Jan's, in and out among the corn-sacks, full canter as far as the old carved
meal-chest, and back to the door again.

Poor Abel, with his double burden, got tired at last, and they sat down and sifted flour for
the education of their thumbs.  Jan was pinching and flattening his with a very solemn face,
in the hope of attaining to a miller's thumb by a shorter process than the common one, when
Abel suddenly said, -

"I tell thee what, then, Jan:  'tis time thee learned thy letters. And I'll teach thee.  Come
hither."

Jan jumped up, thereby pitching the kitten headlong from his shoulders, and ran to Abel, who
was squatting by some spilled flour near a sack, and was smoothing it upon the floor with his
hands. Then very slowly and carefully he traced the letter A in the flour, keenly watched by Jan.

"That's A," said he.  "Say it, Jan.  A."

"A," replied Jan, obediently.  But he had no sooner said it, than, adding hastily, "Let Jan
do it," he traced a second A, slightly larger than Abel's, in three firm and perfectly proportioned
strokes.

His moving finger was too much for the kitten's feelings, and she sprang into the flour and
pawed both the A's out of existence.

Jan slapped her vigorously, and having smoothed the surface once more, he drew A after A with
the greatest rapidity, scrambling along sideways like a crab, and using both hands indifferently,
till the row stretched as far as the flour would permit.

Abel's pride in his pupil was great, and he was fain to run off to call his mother to see the
performances of their prodigy, but Jan was too impatient to spare him.

"Let Jan do more!" he cried.

Abel traced a B in the flour.  "That's B, Jan," said he.

"Jan do it," replied Jan, confidently.

"But say it," said his teacher, restraining him.  "Say B, Jan."

"B," said Jan, impatiently; and adding, "Jan do it," he began a row of B's.  He hesitated slightly
before making the second curve, and looked at his model, after which he went down the line
as before, and quite as successfully.  And the kitten went down also, pawing out each letter
as it was made, under the impression that the whole affair was a game of play with herself.

"There bean't a letter that bothers him," cried Abel, triumphantly, to the no less triumphant
foster-mother.

Jan had, indeed, gone through the whole alphabet, with the utmost ease and self-confidence;
but his remembrance of the names of the letters he drew so readily proved to be far less perfect
than his representations of them on the floor of the round-house.

Abel found his pupil's progress hindered by the very talent that he had displayed.  He was
so anxious to draw the letters that he would not learn them, and Abel was at last obliged to
make one thing a condition of the other.

"Say it then, Jan," he would cry, "and then thee shall make 'em."

Mrs. Lake commissioned Abel to buy a small slate and pencil for Jan at the village shop, and
these were now the child's favorite toys. He would sit quiet for any length of time with them.
Even the sandy kitten was neglected, or got a rap on its nose with the slate- pencil, when
to toy with the moving point had been too great a temptation to be resisted.  For a while Jan's
taste for wielding the pencil was solely devoted to furthering his learning to read.  He drew
letters only till the day that the Cheap Jack called.

The Cheap Jack was a travelling pedler, who did a good deal of business in that neighborhood.
He was not a pedler pure, for he had a little shop in the next town.  Nature had not favored
him.  He was a hunchback.  He was, or pretended to be, deaf.  He had a very ugly face, made
uglier by dirt, above which he wore a mangy hair cap.  He sold rough pottery, cheap crockery
and glass, mock jewelry, low song-books, framed pictures, mirrors, and quack medicines.  He
bought old bottles, bones, and rags.  And what else he bought or sold, or dealt with, was dimly
guessed at by a few, but fully known to none.

Where he was born, what was his true name or age, whether on any given occasion he was speaking
less than lies, and what was the ultimate object of his words and deeds,--at these things no
one even guessed.  That his conscience was ever clean, that his dirty face once masked no vile
or petty plots for evil in the brain behind, that at some past period he was a child,--these
things it would have tasked the strongest faith to realize.

He was not so unpopular with children as the miller's man.

The instinct of children is like the instinct of dogs, very true and delicate as a rule.  But
dogs, from Cerberus downwards, are liable to be biassed by sops.  And four paper-covered sails,
that twirl upon the end of a stick as the wind blows, would warp the better judgment of most
little boys, especially (for a bargain is more precious than a gift) when the thing is to be
bought for a few old bones.

Jan was a little afraid of the Cheap Jack, but he liked his whirligigs.  They went when the
mill was going, and sometimes when the mill wouldn't go, if you ran hard to make a breeze.

But it so happened that the first day on which the Cheap Jack came round after Jan had begun
to learn his letters, he brought forth some wares which moved Jan's feelings more than the
whirligigs did.

"Buy a nice picter, marm?" said the Cheap Jack to Mrs. Lake, who, with the best intentions
not to purchase, felt that there could be no harm in seeing what the man had got.

"You shall have 'Joseph and his Bretheren' cheap," roared the hunchback, becoming more pressing
as the windmiller's wife seemed slow to be fascinated, and shaking "Joseph and his Brethren,"
framed in satin-wood, in her face, as he advanced upon her with an almost threatening air.
"Don't want 'em?  Take 'Antony and Cleopatterer.' It's a sweet picter.  Too dear?  Do you know
what sech picters costs to paint?  Look at Cleopatterer's dress and the jewels she has on.
I don't make a farthing on 'em.  I gets daily bread out of the other things, and only keeps
the picters to oblige one or two ladies of taste that likes to give their rooms a genteel appearance."

The long disuse of such powers of judgment as she had, and long habit of always giving way,
had helped to convert Mrs. Lake's naturally weak will and unselfish disposition into a sort
of mental pulp, plastic to any pressure from without.  To men she invariably yielded; and,
poor specimen of a man as the Cheap Jack was, she had no fibre of personal judgment or decision
in the strength of which to oppose his assertions, and every instant she became more and more
convinced that wares she neither wanted nor approved of were necessary to her, and good bargains,
because the man who sold them said so.

The Cheap Jack was a knave, but he was no fool.  In a crowded market-place, or at a street
door, no oilier tongue wagged than his. But he knew exactly the moment when a doubtful bargain
might be clinched by a bullying tone and a fierce look on his dirty face, at cottage doors,
on heaths or downs, when the good wife was alone with her children, and the nearest neighbor
was half a mile away.

No length of experience taught Mrs. Lake wisdom in reference to the Cheap Jack.

Each time that his cart appeared in sight she resolved to have nothing to do with him, warned
by the latest cracked jug, or the sugar-basin which, after three-quarters of an hour wasted
in chaffering, she had beaten down to three-halfpence dearer than what she afterwards found
to be the shop price in the town.  But proof to the untrained mind is "as water spilled upon
the ground."  And when the Cheap Jack declared that she was quite free to look without buying,
and that he did not want her to buy, Mrs. Lake allowed him to pull down his goods as before,
and listened to his statements as if she had never proved them to be lies, and was thrown into
confusion and fluster when he began to bully, and bought in haste to be rid of him, and repented
at leisure--to no purpose as far as the future was concerned.

"Look here!" yelled the hunchback, as he waddled with horrible swiftness after the miller's
wife, as she withdrew into the mill; "which do you mean to have?  I gets nothing on 'em, whichever
you takes, so please yourself.  Take 'Joseph and his Bretheren.'  The frame's worth twice the
money.  Take the other, too, and I'll take sixpence off the pair, and be out of pocket to please
you."

"Nothing to-day, thank you!" said Mrs. Lake, as loudly as she could.

"Got any other sort, you say?" said the Cheap Jack.  "I've got all sorts, but some parties
is so difficult to please.

"Wait a bit, wait a bit," he continued, as Mrs. Lake again tried to make him (willing to) hear
that she wanted none of his wares; and, vanishing with the uncanny quickness common to him,
he waddled swiftly back again to his cart, and returned, before Mrs. Lake could secure herself
from intrusion, laden with a fresh supply of pictures, the weight of which it seemed marvellous
that he could support.

"Now you've got your choice, marm," he said.  "It's no trouble to me to oblige a good customer.
There's picters for you!"

"PITCHERS!" said Jan, admiringly, as he crept up to them.

"So they are, my little man.  Now then, help your mammy to choose. Most of these is things
you can't get now, for love nor money.  Here you are,--'Love and Beauty.'  That's a sweet thing.
'St Joseph,' 'The Robber's Bride,' 'Child and Lamb,' 'Melan-choly.'  Here's an old" -

"Pitcher!" exclaimed Jan once more, gazing at an old etching in a dirty frame, which the Cheap
Jack was holding in his hand. "Pitcher, pitcher! let Jan look!" he cried.

 Children mostly likes the gay picters, and worrits their

pawnshop, my dear, in a lot.  I almost think I let it go too cheap; but that's my failing.
And a beggarly place like this ain't like London.  In London there's a place for every thing,
my dear, and shops for old goods as well as new, and customers too; and the older and dirtier
some things is, the more they fetches."

There was a pause, for George did not speak; and the Cheap Jack, bent upon amiability, repeated
his remark,--"A sharp little brat, too!"

"What be 'ee harping on about him for?" asked George, suspiciously. "I knows what I knows about
un, but that's no business of yours."

"You know about most things, my dear," said the Cheap Jack, flatteringly.  "They'll have to
get up very early that catch you napping.  But what about the child, George?"

"Never you mind," said George.  "But he ain't none of the miller's, I'll tell 'ee that; and
he ain't the missus's neither."

"What is he to YOU, my dear?" asked the dwarf, curiously, and, getting no answer, he went on:
"He'd be useful in a good many lines.  He'd not do bad in a circus, but he'd draw prime as
a young prodigy."

George looked round, "You be thinking of stealing HE then, as well as" -

"Hush, my dear," said the dwarf.  "No, no, I don't want him.  But there was a good deal of
snatching young kids done in my young days; for sweeps, destitute orphans, juvenile performers,
and so on."

"HE wouldn't suit you," grinned George.  "A comes of genteel folk, and a's not hard enough
for how you'd treat un."

"You're out there, George," said the dwarf.  "Human beings is like 'osses; it's the genteelest
as stands the most.  'Specially if they've been well fed when they was babies."

At this point the Cheap Jack was interrupted by his horse stumbling over a huge, jagged lump
of flint, that, with the rest of the road- mending, was a disgrace to a highway of a civilized
country.  A rate-payer or a horse-keeper might have been excused for losing his temper with
the authorities of the road-mending department; but the Cheap Jack's wrath fell upon his horse.
He beat him over the knees for stumbling, and across the hind legs for slipping, and over his
face for wincing, and accompanied his blows with a torrent of abuse.

What a moment that must have been for Balaam's ass, in which she found voice to remonstrate
against the unjust blows, which have, nevertheless, fallen pretty thickly ever since upon her
descendants and their fellow-servants of ungrateful man!  From how many patient eyes that old
reproach, of long service ill-requited, yet speaks almost as plainly as the voice that "rebuked
the madness of the prophet!"

The Cheap Jack's white horse had a point of resemblance to the "genteel human beings" of whom
he had been speaking.  It had "come of a good stock," and had seen better and kinder days;
and to it, also, in its misfortunes, there remained that nobility of spirit which rises in
proportion to the ills it meets with.  The poor old thing was miserably weak, and sore and
jaded, and the flints were torture.  But it rallied its forces, gave a desperate struggle,
and got the cart safely to the bottom of the hill.  Here the road turned sharply, and the horse
went on.  But after a few paces it stopped as before; this time in front of a small public-house,
where trembling, and bathed in perspiration, it waited for its master.

The public-house was a small dark, dingy-looking hovel, with a reputation fitted to its appearance.

A dirty, grim-looking man nodded to the Cheap Jack and George as they entered, and a girl equally
dirty, but much handsomer, brought glasses of spirits, to which the friends applied themselves,
at the Cheap Jack's expense.  George grew more sociable, and the Cheap Jack reproached him
with want of confidence in his friends.

"You're so precious sharp, my dear," said the hunchback, who knew well on what point George
liked to be flattered, "that you overreaches yourself.  I don't complain--after all the business
we've done together--that it's turned slack all of a sudden.  You says they're down on you,
and that's enough for me.  I don't complain that you've got your own plans and keeps 'em as
secret as the grave, but I says you'll regret it.  If you was a good scholar, George, you could
do without friends, you're so precious sharp.  But you're no scholar, my dear, and you'll be
let in yet, by a worse friend than Cheap John."

George so bitterly regretted his want of common learning, and the stupidity which made him
still slow to decipher print, and utterly puzzled by writing, that the Cheap Jack's remarks
told strongly. These, and the conversation they had had on the hill, recalled to his mind a
matter which was still a mystery to the miller's man.

"Look here, Jack," said he, leaning across the dirty little table; "if you be such a good scholar,
what do M O E R D Y K spell?"

"Say it again, George," said the dwarf.  But when, after that, he still looked puzzled, George
laughed long and loudly.

"You be a good scholar!" he cried.  "You be a fine friend, too, for a iggerant man.  If a can't
tell the first word of a letter, 'tis likely 'ee could read the whole, too!"

"The first word of a LETTER, eh?" said the dwarf.

"The very first," said George.  "'Tis a long way you'd get in it, and stuck at the start!"

  The
other children wrote so slowly that time had hung heavy on his hands; and, instead of copying
the figures in a row, he had made a drawing of the clock-face, with the figures on it; but
instead of the hands, he had put eyes, nose, and mouth, and below the mouth a round gray blot,
which William instantly recognized for a portrait of the mole on Dame Datchett's chin.  This
brilliant caricature so tickled him, that he had a fit of choking from suppressed laughter;
and he and Jan, being detected "in mischief," were summoned with their slates to the Dame's chair.

William came off triumphant; but when the Dame caught sight of Jan's slate, without minutely
examining his work, she said, "Zo thee's been scraaling on thee slate, instead of writing thee
figures," and at once began to fumble beneath her chair.

But William had slightly moved the strap with his foot, as he stood with a perfectly unmoved
and vacant countenance beside the Dame, which made some delay; and as Mrs. Datchett bent lower
on the right side of her chair, William began upon the left a "hum," which, with a close imitation
of the crowing of a cock, the grunting of a pig, and the braying of a donkey, formed his chief
stock of accomplishments.

"Drat the thing!  Where be un?" said the Dame, endangering her balance in the search.

"B-z-z-z-z!" went William behind the chair; and he added, sotto voce, to Jan, "She be as dunch
as a bittle."

At last the Dame heard, and looked round.  "Be that a harnet, missus, do 'ee think?" said William,
with a face as guileless as a babe's.

Dame Datchett rose in terror.  William bent to look beneath her chair for the hornet, and of
course repeated his hum.  As the hornet could neither be found nor got rid of, the alarmed
old lady broke up the school, and went to lay a trap of brown sugar outside the window for
her enemy.  And so Jan escaped a beating.

But this and the story of his first fight are digressions.  It yet remains to be told how he
took to drawing pigs.

Dame Datchett's cottage was the last on one side of the street; but it did not face the street,
but looked over the water-meadows, and the little river, and the bridge.

As Jan sat on the end of the form, he could look through the Dame's open door, the chief view
from which was of a place close by the bridge, and on the river's bank, where the pig-minders
of the village brought their pigs to water.  Day after day, when the tedium of doing nothing
under Dame Datchett's superintendence was insufficiently relieved to Jan's active mind by pinching
"Willum" till he giggled, or playing cat's-cradle with one of his foster- brothers, did he
welcome the sight of a flock of pigs with their keeper, scuttling past the Dame's door, and
rushing snorting to the stream.

Much he envied the freedom of the happy pig-minder, whilst the vagaries of the pigs were an
unfailing source of amusement.

The degree and variety of expression in a pig's eye can only be appreciated by those who have
studied pigs as Morland must have studied them.  The pertness, the liveliness, the humor, the
love of mischief, the fiendish ingenuity and perversity of which pigs are capable, can be fully
known to the careworn pig-minder alone.  When they are running away,--and when are they not
running away?--they have an action with the hind legs very like a donkey in a state of revolt.
But they have none of the donkey's too numerous grievances. And if donkeys squealed at every
switch, as pigs do, their undeserved sufferings would have cried loud enough for vengeance
before this.

Jan's opportunities for studying pigs were good.  As the smallest and swiftest of the flock,
his tail tightly curled, and indescribable jauntiness in his whole demeanor, came bounding
to the river's brink, followed by his fellows, driving, pushing, snuffing, winking, and gobbling,
and lastly by a small boy in a large coat, with a long switch, Jan was witness of the whole
scene from Dame Datchett's door.  And, as he sat with his slate and pencil before him, he naturally
took to drawing the quaint comic faces and expressive eyes of the herd, and their hardly less
expressive backs and tails; and to depicting the scenes which took place when the pigs had
enjoyed their refreshment, and with renewed vigor led their keeper in twenty different directions,
instead of going home.  Back, up the road, where he could hardly drive them at the point of
the switch a few hours before; by sharp turns into Squire Ammaby's grounds, or the churchyard;
and helter-skelter through the water- meadows.

The fame of Jan's "pitcher-making" had gone before him to Dame Datchett's school by the mouths
of his foster-brothers and sisters, and he found a dozen little voices ready to dictate subjects
for his pencil.

"Make a 'ouse, Janny Lake."  "Make thee vather's mill, Janny Lake." "Make a man.  Make Dame
Datchett.  Make the parson.  Make the Cheap Jack.  Make Daddy Angel.  Make Master Chuter. 
Make a oss--cow-- ship--pig!"

But the popularity obtained by Jan's pigs soon surpassed that of all his other performances.

"Make pigs for I, Janny Lake!" and "Make pigs for I, too!" was a sort of whispering chorus
that went on perpetually under the Dame's nose.  But when she found that it led to no disturbance,
that the children only huddled round the child Jan and his slate like eager scholars round
a teacher, Dame Datchett was wise enough to be thankful that Jan possessed a power she had
never been able to acquire,--that he could "keep the young varments quiet."

"He be most's good's a monitor," thought the Dame; and she took a nap, and Jan's genius held
the school together.

The children tried other influences besides persuasion.

"Jan Lake, I've brought thee an apple.  Draa out a pig for I on a's slate."

Jan had a spirit of the most upright and honorable kind.  He never took an unfair advantage,
and to the petty cunning which was "Willum's" only idea of wisdom he seemed by nature incapable
of stooping.  But in addition to, and alongside of, his artistic temperament, there appeared
to be in him no small share of the spirit of a trader.  The capricious, artistic spirit made
him fitful in his use even of the beloved slate; but, when he was least inclined to draw, the
offer of something he very much wanted would spur him to work; and in the spirit of a true
trader, he worked well.

He would himself have made a charming study for a painter, as he sat surrounded by his patrons,
who watched him with gaping mouths of wonderment, as his black eyes moved rapidly to and fro
between the river's brink and his slate, and his tiny fingers steered the pencil into cunning
lines which "made pigs."  "The very moral!" as William declared, smacking his corduroy breeches
with delight.

Sometimes Jan hardly knew that they were there, he was so absorbed in his work.  His eyes glowed
with that strong pleasure which comes in the very learning of any art, perhaps of any craft.
Now and then, indeed, his face would cloud with a different expression, and in fits of annoyance,
like that in which his foster-mother found him outside the windmill, he would break his pencils,
and ruthlessly destroy sketches with which his patrons would have been quite satisfied.  But
at other moments his face would twinkle with a very sunshine of smiles, as he was conscious
of having caught exactly the curve which expressed obstinacy in this pig's back, or the air
of reckless defiance in that other's tail.

And so he learned little or nothing, and improved in his drawing, and kept the school quiet,
and had always a pocket well filled with sweet things, nails, string, tops, balls, and such
treasures, earned by his art.

One day as he sat "making pigs" for one after another of the group of children round him, a
pig of especial humor having drawn a murmur of delight from the circle, this murmur was dismally
echoed by a sob from a little maid on the outside of the group.  It was Master Chuter's little
daughter, a pretty child, with an oval, dainty- featured face, and a prim gentleness about
her, like a good little girl in a good little story.  The intervening young rustics began to
nudge each other and look back at her.

"Kitty Chuter be crying!" they whispered.

"What be amiss with 'ee, then, Kitty Chuter?" said Jan, looking up from his work; and the question
was passed on with some impatience, as her tears prevented her reply.  "What be amiss with 'ee?"

"Janny Lake have never made a pig for I," sobbed the little maid, with her head dolefully inclined
to her left shoulder, and her oval face pulled to a doubly pensive length.  "I axed my vather
to let me get him a posy, and a said I might.  And I got un some vine Bloody Warriors, and
a heap of Boy's Love off our big bush, that smelled beautiful.  And vather says a can have
some water-blobs off our pond when they blows.  But Tommy Green met I as a was coming down
to school, and a snatched my vlowers from me, and I begged un to let me keep some of un, and
a only laughed at me.  And I daren't go back, for I was late; and now I've nothin' to give
Janny Lake to make a draft of a pig for I."  And, having held up for the telling of her tale,
the little maid broke down in fresh tears.

Jan finished off the tail of the pig he was drawing with a squeak of the pencil that might
have come from the pig itself and, stuffing the slate into its owner's hands, he ran up to
Kitty Chuter and kissed her wet cheeks, saying, "Give I thee slate, Kitty Chuter, and I'll
make thee the best pig of all.  I don't want nothing from thee for 't.  And when school's done,
I'll whop Tommy Green, if I sees him."

And forthwith, without looking from the door for studies, Jan drew a fat sow with her little
ones about her; the other children clustering round to peep, and crying, "He've made Kitty
Chuter one, two, three, vour, VIVE pigs!"

"Ah, and there be two more you can't see, because the old un be lying on 'em," said Jan.

"Six, seven!" William counted; and he assisted the calculation by sticking up first a thumb
and then a forefinger as he spoke.

Some who had not thought half a ball of string, or a dozen nails as good as new, too much to
pay for a single pig drawn on one side of their slates, and only lasting as long as they could
contrive to keep the other side in use without quite smudging that one, were now disposed to
be dissatisfied with their bargains.  But as the school broke up, and Tom Green was seen loitering
on the other side of the road, every thing was forgotten in the general desire to see Jan carry
out his threat, and "whop" a boy bigger than himself for bullying a little girl.

Jan showed no disposition to shirk, and William acted as his friend, and held his slate and book.

Success is not always to the just, however; and poor Jan was terribly beaten by his big opponent,
though not without giving him some marks of the combat to carry away.

Kitty Chuter wept bitterly for Jan's bloody nose; but he comforted her, saying, "Never mind,
Kitty; if he plagues thee again, 'll fight un again and again, till I whops he."

But his valor was not put to the proof, for Tommy Green molested her no more.

Jan washed his face in the water-meadows, and went stout-heartedly home, where Master Lake
beat him afresh, as he ironically said, "to teach him to vight young varments like himself
instead of minding his book."

But upon Master Chuter, of the Heart of Oak, the incident made quite a different impression.
He was naturally pleased by Jan's championship of his child, and, added to this, he was much
impressed by the sketch on the slate.  It was, he said, the "living likeness" of his own sow;
and, as she had seven young pigs, the portrait was exact, allowing for the two which Jan had
said were out of sight.

He gave Kitty a new slate, and kept the sketch, which he showed to all in-comers.  He displayed
it one evening to the company assembled round the hearth of the little inn, and took occasion
to propound his views on the subject of Jan's future life.

(Master Chuter was fond of propounding his views,--a taste which was developed by always being
sure of an audience.)

"It's nothing to me," said Master Chuter, speaking of Jan, "who the boy be.  It be no fault
of his'n if he's a fondling.  And one thing's sure enough.  Them that left him with Master
Lake left something besides him.  There was that advertisement,--you remember that about the
five-pound bill in the paper, Daddy Angel?"

"Ay, ay, Master Chuter," said Daddy Angel; "after the big storm, five year ago. In another place,
speaking of the sunday, he says as an lake into glass of hither two
inches will exhibit a small or whole appearance to the disk, caused
by the hand of spaces like beautiful brightness.

And i may add only that Dawes recommends a aperture for sun work,

over practice including that purpose of a inch refractor.

That t did know, had the North Expert is a most different curdled.

  He've boys enough of his own to take to the mill, and Jan do seem to have
such an uncommon turn for drawing things out, I'd try him with painting and varnishing, if
he was mine.  And I believe he'd come to signs, too! Look at that, now!  It be small, and the
boy've had no paint to lay on, but there's the sign of the Jolly Sow for you, as natteral as
life.  You know about signs, Master Linseed," continued the landlord.  For there was a tradition
that the painter could "do picture-signs," though he had only been known to renew lettered
ones since he came to the neighborhood.  "Master Lake should 'prentice him with you when he's
older," Master Chuter said in conclusion.

But Master Linseed did not respond warmly.  He felt it a little beneath his dignity as a sign-painter
to jump at the idea, though the rest of the company assented in a general murmur.

"Scrawling on a slate," the painter and decorator began--and at this point he paused, after
the leisurely customs of the district, to light his pipe at the leaden-weighted candlestick
which stood near; and then, as his hearers sat expectant, but not impatient, proceeded:  "Scrawling
on a slate is one thing, Master Chuter: painting and decorating's another.  Painting's a trade;
and not rightly to be understood by them that's not larned it, nor to be picked up by all as
can scrawl a line here and a line there, as the whim takes 'em. Have they did suddenly him endure to castigation,

There were moments of greater triumph to come, of which he yet wotted not, when the sevenfold
fulfilment of his prediction should be past dispute, and attested from his own walls by more
lasting monuments of Jan's skill than the too perishable sketch which now stood like a text
for the innkeeper on the mantelpiece of the Heart of Oak.

A mop is a local name for a hiring-fair, at which young men and women present themselves to
be hired as domestic servants or farm laborers for a year.  It was at a mop that the windmiller
had hired George, and it was at that annual festival that his long service came to an end.
He betook himself to the town, where the fair was going on, not with any definite intention
of seeking another master, but from a variety of reasons:  partly for a holiday, and to "see
the fun;" partly to visit the Cheap Jack, and hear what advice he had to give, and to learn
what was in the letter; partly with the idea that something might suggest itself in the busy
town as a suitable investment for his savings and his talents.  At the worst, he could but
take another place.

The sun shone brightly on the market-place as George passed through it.  The scene was quaint
and picturesque.  Booths, travelling shows, penny theatres, quack doctors, tumblers, profile
cutters, exhibitors and salesmen of all sorts, thronged the square, and overflowed into a space
behind, where some houses had been burnt down and never rebuilt; whilst round the remains of
the market cross in the centre were grouped the lads and lasses "on hire."  The girls were
smartly dressed, and the young men in snowy smocks, above which peeped waistcoats of gay colors,
looked in the earlier part of the day so spruce, that it was as lamentable to see them after
the hours of beer-drinking and shag tobacco-smoking which followed, as it was to see what might
have been a neighborly and cheerful festival finally swamped in drunkenness and debauchery.

George's smock was white, and George's waistcoat was red, and he had made himself smart enough,
but he did not linger amongst his fellow- servants at the Cross.  He hurried through the crowd,
nodding sheepishly in answer to a shower of chaff and greetings, and made his way to the by-street
where the Cheap Jack had a small dingy shop for the sale of coarse pottery.  Some people were
spiteful enough to hint that the shop-trade was of much less value to him than the store-room
attached, where the goods were believed to be not all of one kind.

The red bread-pans, pipkins, flower-pots, and so forth, were grouped about the door with some
attempt at effective display, and with cheap prices marked in chalk upon their sides.  The
window was clean, and in it many knick-knacks of other kinds were mixed with the smaller china
ware.  And, when George entered the shop, the hunchback's wife was behind the counter.  Like
Mrs. Lake, he paused to think where he could have seen her before; the not uncomely face marred
by an ugly mouth, in which the upper lip was long and cleft, and the lower lip large and heavy,
seemed familiar to him.  He was still beating his brains when the Cheap Jack came in.

George had been puzzled that the woman's countenance did not seem new to him, and he was puzzled
and disturbed also that the expression on the face of the Cheap Jack was quite new.  Whatever
the hunchback had in his head, however, he was not unfriendly in his manner.

"Good morning, George, my dear!" he cried, cheerfully; "you've seen my missus before, eh, George?"
George was just about to say no, when he remembered that he had seen the woman, and when and where.

"Dreadful night that was, Mr. Sannel!" said the Cheap Jack's wife, with a smile on her large
mouth.  George assented, and by the hospitable invitation of the newly married couple he followed
them into the dwelling part of the house, trying as he did so to decide upon a plan for his
future conduct.

Here at last was a woman who could probably tell all that he wanted to know about the mystery
on which he had hoped to trade, and--the Cheap Jack had married her.  If any thing could be
got out of the knowledge of Jan's history, the Cheap Jack, and not George, would get it now.
The hasty resolution to which George came was to try to share what he could not keep entirely
to himself.  He flattered himself he could be very civil, and--he had got the letter.

It proved useful.  George was resolved not to show it until he had got at something of what
the large-mouthed woman had to tell; and, as she wanted to see the letter, she made a virtue
of necessity, and seemed anxious to help the miller's man to the utmost of her power.

The history of her connection with Jan's babyhood was soon told, and she told it truthfully.

Five years before her marriage to the Cheap Jack, she was a chambermaid in a small hotel in
London, and "under notice to leave." Why--she did not deem it necessary to tell George.  In
this hotel Jan was born, and Jan's mother died.  She was a foreigner, it was supposed, and
her husband also, for they talked a foreign language to each other.  He was not with her when
she first came, but he joined her afterwards, and was with her at her death.  So far the Cheap
Jack's wife spoke upon hearsay.  Though employed at the hotel, which was very full, she was
not sleeping in the house; she was not on good terms with the landlady, nor even with the other
servants, and her first real connection with the matter was when the gentleman, overhearing
some "words" between her and the landlady at the bar, abruptly asked her if she were in want
of employment.  He employed her,--to take the child to the very town where she was now living
as the Cheap Jack's wife.  He did not come with her, as he had to attend his wife's funeral.
It was understood at the hotel that he was going to take the body abroad for interment.  So
the porter had said.  The person to whom she was directed to bring the child was a respectable
old woman, living in the outskirts of the town, whose business was sick-nursing. October, 1888, Société

This is each concern, today, as we discourse section. It is merely evident disagreement that

The position was perplexing, if he had had a sober head to consider it with.  That pickpockets
abounded had been well impressed upon his slow intellect, and that there was no means of tracing
property so lost, in the crowd and confusion of the mop.  True, his property was worth "crying,"
worth offering a reward for.  But the pocket-book was not his, and the letter was not addressed
to him; and it was doubtful if he even dare run the risk of claiming them.

His first despair was succeeded by a sort of drunken fury, in which he accused the men sitting
with him of robbing him, and then swore it was the Cheap Jack, and so raved till the landlord
of the King's Arms expelled him as "drunk and disorderly," and most of the company refused
to believe that he had had any such sum of money to lose.

Exactly how or where, after this, the sergeant found him, George could not remember, but his
general impression of the sergeant's kindness was strong.  He could recall that he pumped upon
his head in the yard of the King's Arms, to sober him, by George's own request; and that it
did somewhat clear his brain, his remembrance of seeing the sergeant wipe his fingers on a
cambric handkerchief seems to prove.  They then paced up and down together arm in arm, if not
as accurately in step as might have been agreeable to the soldier.  George remembered hearing
of prize money, to which his own loss was a bagatelle, and gathering on the whole that the
army, as a profession, opened a sort of boundless career of opportunities to a man of his peculiar
talents and appearance.  There was something infectious, too, in the gay easy style in which
the soldier seemed to treat fortune, good or ill; and the miller's man was stimulated at last
to vow that he was not such a fool as he looked, and would "never say die."  To the best of
his belief, the sergeant replied in terms which showed that, had he been "in cash," George's
loss would have been made good by him, out of pure generosity, and on the spot.

As it was, he pressed upon his acceptance the sum of one shilling, which the miller's man pocketed
with tears.

What recruit can afterwards remember which argument of the skilful sergeant did most to melt
his discretion into valor?

The sun had not dried the dew from the wolds, and the sails of the windmill hung idle in the
morning air, when George Sannel made his first march to the drums and fifes, with ribbons flying
from his hat, a recruit of the 206th (Royal Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot.

As the Cheap Jack and his wife hastened home from the mop, Sal had some difficulty in restraining
her husband's impatience to examine the pocket-book as they walked along.

Prudence prevailed, however, and it was not opened till they were at home and alone.

In notes and money, George's savings amounted to more than thirteen pounds.

"Pretty well, my dear," said the Cheap Jack, grinning hideously. "And now for the letter. 
Read it aloud, Sal, my dear; you're a better scholar than me."

Sal opened the thin, well-worn sheet, and read the word "Moerdyk," but then she paused.  And,
like Abel, she paused so long that the hunchback pressed impatiently to look over her shoulder.

But the letter was written in a foreign language, and the Cheap Jack and his wife were no wiser
for it than the miller's man.

Midsummer came, and the Dame's school broke up for the holidays. Jan had longed for them intensely.
Not that he was oppressed by the labors of learning, but that he wanted to be out of doors.
Many a little one was equally eager for the freedom of the fields, but the common child-love
for hedges and ditches, and flower-picking, and the like, was intensified in Jan by a deeper
pleasure which country scenes awoke from the artist nature within him.  That it is no empty
sentimentality to speak of an artist nature in a child, let the child-memories of all artists
bear witness!  That they inspired the poet Wordsworth with one of his best poems, and that
they have dyed the canvas of most landscape painters with the indestructible local coloring
of the scenes of each man's childhood, will hardly be denied.

That this is against the wishes and the theories of many excellent people has nothing to do
with its truth.  If all children were the bluff, hearty, charmingly naughty, enviably happy,
utterly simple and unsentimental beings that some of us wish, and so assert them to be, it
might be better for them, or it might not--who can say?  That the healthy, careless, rough
and ready type is the one to encourage, many will agree, who cannot agree that it is universal,
or even much the most common.  It is probably from an imperfect remembrance of their nursery
lives that some people believe that the griefs of one's childhood are light, its joys uncomplicated,
and its tastes simple.  A clearer recollection of the favorite poetry and the most cherished
day-dreams of very early years would probably convince them that the strongest taste for tragedy
comes before one's teens, and inclines to the melodramatic; that sentimentality (of some kind)
is grateful to the verge of mawkishness; and that simple tastes are rather a result of culture
and experience than natural gifts of infancy.

But in this rummaging up of the crude tastes, the hot little opinions, the romance, the countless
visions, the many affectations of nursery days, there will be recalled also a very real love
of nature; varying, of course, in its intensity from a mere love of fresh air and free romping,
and a destructive taste for nosegays, to a living romance about the daily walks of the imaginative
child,--a world apart, peopled with invisible company, such as fairies, and those fancy friends
which some children devise for themselves, or with the beasts and flowers, to which love has
given a personality.

To the romance child-fancy weaves for itself about the meadows where the milkmaids stand thick
and pale, and those green courts where lords and ladies live, Jan added that world of pleasure
open to those gifted with a keen sense of form and color.  Strange gleams under a stormy sky,
sunshine on some kingfisher's plumage rising from the river, and all the ever-changing beauties
about him, stirred his heart with emotions that he could not have defined.

There was much to see even from Dame Datchett's open door, but there was more to be imagined.
Jan's envy of the pig-minder had reached a great height when the last school-day came.

He wanted to be free by the time that the pig-herd brought his pigs to water, and his wishes
were fulfilled.  The Dame's flock and the flock of the swineherd burst at one and the same
moment into the water-meadows, and Jan was soon in conversation with the latter.

"Thee likes pig-minding, I reckon?" said Jan, stripping the leaves from a sallywithy wand,
which he had picked to imitate that of the swineherd.

"Do I?" said the large-coated urchin, wiping his face with the big sleeve of his blue coat.
"That's aal thee knows about un.  I be going to leave to-morrow, I be.  And if so be Master
Salter's got another bwoy, or if so be he's not, I dunno, it ain't nothin' to I."

Jan learned that he had eighteen pence a week for driving the pigs to a wood at some little
distance, where they fed on acorns, beech- mast, etc.; for giving them water, keeping them
together, and bringing them home at teatime.  He allowed that he could drive them as slowly
as he pleased, and that they kept pretty well together in the wood; but that, as a whole, the
perversity of pigs was such that-- "Well, wait till ee tries it theeself, Jan Lake, that's aal."

Jan had resolved to do so.  He did not return with his foster- brothers to the mill.  He slipped
off on one of his solitary expeditions, and made his way to the farm-house of Master Salter.

Master Salter and his wife sat at tea in the kitchen.  In the cheerful clatter of cups, they
had failed to hear Jan's knock; but the sunshine streaming through the open doorway being broken
by some small body, the farmer's wife looked hastily up, thinking that the new-born calf had
got loose, and was on the threshold.

But it was Jan.  The outer curls of his hair gleamed in the sunlight like an aureole about
his face.  He had doffed his hat, out of civility, and he held it in one hand, whilst with
the other he fingered the slate that hung at his waist.

"Massey upon us!" said the farmer, looking up at the same instant. "And who be thee?"

"Jan Lake, the miller's son, maester."

"Come in, come in!" cried Master Salter, hospitably.  "So Master Lake have sent thee with a
message, eh?"

"My father didn't send me," said Jan, gravely.  "I come myself.  Do 'ee want a pig-minder,
Master Salter?"

"Ay, I wants a pig-minder.  But I reckon thee father can't spare Abel for that now.  A wish
he could.  Abel was careful with the pigs, he was, and a sprack boy, too."

"I'll be careful, main careful, Master Salter," said Jan, earnestly. "I likes pigs."  But the
farmer was pondering.

"Jan Lake--Jan," said he.  "Be thee the boy as draad out the sow and her pigs for Master Chuter's
little gel?"  Jan nodded.

"Lor massey!" cried Master Salter.  "I' told'ee, missus, about un. Look here, Jan Lake.  If
thee'll draa me out some pigs like them, I'll give 'ee sixpence and a new slate, and I'll try
thee for a week, anyhow."

Jan drew the slate-pencil from his pocket without reply. See-cockerel from region. William byrny

  From this it came about that the Squire's affection
for his wife took the shape of wishing Lady Louisa to have every thing that she wished for,
and that the very joy of his heart was his little daughter Amabel.

Amabel was between three and four years old, and to some extent a prodigy.  She was as tall
as an average child of six or seven, and stout in proportion.  The size of her shoes scandalized
her grandmother, and once drew tears from Lady Louisa as she reflected on the probable size
of Miss Ammaby's feet by the time she was "presented."

Lady Louisa was tall and weedy; the Squire was tall and robust. Amabel inherited height on
both sides, but in face and in character she was more like her father than her mother.  Indeed,
Lady Louisa would close her eyes, and Lady Craikshaw would put up her gold glass at the child,
and they would both cry, "Sadly coarse!  QUITE AN AMMABY!"  Amabel was not coarse, however;
but she had a strength and originality of character that must have come from some bygone generation,
if it was inherited.  She had a pitying affection for her mother.  With her grandmother she
lived at daggers drawn.  She kept up a pretty successful struggle for her own way in the nursery.
She was devoted to her father, when she could get at him, and she poured an almost boundless
wealth of affection on every animal that came in her way.

An uncle had just given her a Spanish saddle, and her father had promised to buy her a donkey.
He had heard of one, and was going to drive to the town to see the owner.  With great difficulty
Amabel had got permission from her mother and grandmother to go with the Squire in the pony
carriage.  As she had faithfully promised to "be good," she submitted to be "well wrapped up,"
under her grandmother's direction, and staggered downstairs in coat, cape, gaiters, comforter,
muffatees, and with a Shetland veil over her burning cheeks.  She even displayed a needless
zeal by carrying a big shawl in a lump in her arms, which she would give up to no one.

"No, no!" she cried, as the Squire tried to take it from her.  "Lift me in, daddy, lift me in!"

The Squire laughed, and obeyed her, saying, "Why, bless my soul, Amabel, I think you grow heavier
every day."

Amabel came up crimson from some disposal of the shawl after her own ideas, and her eyes twinkled
as he spoke, though her fat cheeks kept their gravity.  It was not till they were far on their
way that a voice from below the seat cried, "Yap!"

"Why, there's one of the dogs in the carriage," said the Squire.

On which, clinging to one of his arms and caressing him, Amabel confessed, "It's only the pug,
dear daddy.  I brought him in under the shawl.  I did so want him to have a treat too.  And
grandmamma is so hard!  She hardly thinks I ought to have treats, and she NEVER thinks of treats
for the dogs."

The Squire only laughed, and said she must take care of the dog when they got to the town;
and Amabel was encouraged to ask if she might take off the Shetland veil.  Hesitating between
his fear of Amabel's catching cold, and a common-sense conviction that it was ludicrous to
dress her according to her invalid mother's susceptibilities, the Squire was relieved from
the responsibility of deciding by Amabel's promptly exposing her rosy cheeks to the breeze,
and they drove on happily to the town.  The Squire had business with the Justices, and Amabel
was left at the Crown.  When he came back, Amabel jumped down from the window and the black
blind over which she was peeping into the yard, and ran up to her father with tears on her face.

"Oh, daddy!" she cried, "dear, good daddy!  I don't want you to buy me a donkey, I want you
to buy me a horse."

"That's modest!" said the Squire; "but what are you crying for?"

"Oh, it's such a poor horse!  Such a very old, poor horse!" cried Amabel.  And from the window
Mr. Ammaby was able to confirm her statements.  It was the Cheap Jack's white horse, which
he had been trying to persuade the landlord to buy as a cab-horse.  More lean, more scarred,
more drooping than ever, it was a pitiful sight, now and then raising its soft nose and intelligent
eyes to the window, as if it knew what a benevolent little being was standing on a slippery
chair, with her arms round the Squire's neck, pleading its cause.

"But when I buy horses," said the Squire, "I buy young, good ones, not very old and poor ones."

"Oh, but do buy it, daddy!  Perhaps it's not had enough to eat, like that kitten I found in
the ditch.  And perhaps it'll get fat, like her; and mamma said we wanted an old horse to go
in the cart for luggage, and I'm sure that one's very old.  And that's such a horrid man, like
hump-backed Richard.  And when nobody's looking, he tugs it, and beats it.  Oh, I wish I could
beat him!" and Amabel danced dangerously upon the horsehair seat in her white gaiters with
impotent indignation.  The Squire was very weak when pressed by his daughter, but at horses,
if at any thing, he looked with an eye to business.  To buy such a creature would be ludicrous.
Still, Amabel had made a strong point by what Lady Louisa had said.  No one, too, knew better
than the Squire what difference good and bad treatment can make in a horse, and this one had
been good once, as his experienced eye told him.  He said he "would see," and strolled into
the yard.

Long practice had given the Cheap Jack a quickness in detecting a possible purchaser which
almost amounted to an extra sense, and he at once began to assail the Squire.  But a nearer
view of the white horse had roused Mr. Ammaby's indignation.

"I wonder," he said, "that you're not ashamed to exhibit a poor beast that's been so ill-treated.
For heaven's sake, take it to the knacker's, and put it out of its misery at once."

"Look ye, my lord," said the Cheap Jack, touching his cap.  "The horse have been ill-treated,
I knows.  I'm an afflicted man, my lord, and the boy I've employed, he's treated him shameful;
and when a man can't feed hisself, he can't keep his beast fat neither. That's why I wants
to get rid on him, my lord.  I can't keep him as I should, and I'd like to see him with a gentleman
like yourself as'll do him justice.  He comes of a good stock, my lord.  Take him for fifteen
pound," he added, waddling up to the Squire, "and when you've had him three months, you'll
sell him for thirty."

This was too much.  The Squire broke out in a furious rage.

"You unblushing scoundrel!" he cried.  "D'ye think I'm a fool? Fifteen pounds for a horse you
should be fined for keeping alive! Be off with it, and put it out of misery."  And he turned
indignantly into the inn, the Cheap Jack calling after him, "Say ten pound, my lord!" the bystanders
giggling, and the ostler whistling dryly through the straw in his mouth, "Take it to the knacker's,
Cheap John."

"Oh, daddy dear! have you got him?" cried Amabel, as the Squire re- entered the parlor.

"No, my dear; the poor beast isn't fit to draw carts, my darling. It's been so badly treated,
the only kindness now is to kill it, and put it out of pain.  And I've told the hunchback so."

It was a matter of course and humanity to the Squire, but it overwhelmed poor Amabel.  She
gasped, "Kill it!" and then bursting into a flood of tears she danced on the floor, wringing
her hands and crying, "Oh, oh, oh! don't, PLEASE, don't let him be killed! Oh! do, do buy him
and let him die comfortably in the paddock.  Oh, do, do, do!"

"Nonsense, Amabel, you mustn't dance like that.  Remember, you promised to be good," said the
Squire.  The child gulped down her tears, and stood quite still, with her face pale from very
misery.

"I don't want not to be good," said she.  "But, oh dear, I do wish I had some money, that I
might buy that poor old horse, and let him die comfortably at home."

It was not the money the Squire grudged; it was against all his instincts to buy a bad horse.
But Amabel's wan face overcame him, and he went out again.  He never lingered over disagreeable
business, and, going straight up to the Cheap Jack, he said, "My little girl is so distressed
about it, that I'll give you five pounds for the poor brute, to stop its sufferings."

"Say eight, my lord," said the Cheap Jack.  Once more the Squire was turning away in wrath,
when he caught sight of Amabel's face at the window.  He turned back, and, biting his lip,
said, "I'll give you five pounds if you'll take it now, and go.  If you beat me down again,
I'll offer you four.  I'll take off a pound for every bate you utter; and, when I speak, I
mean what I say.  Do you think I don't know one horse from another?"

It is probable that the Cheap Jack would have made another effort to better his bargain, but
his wife had come to seek him, and to her sharp eyes the Squire's resolution was beyond mistake.

"We'll take the five guineas, and thank you, sir," she said, courtesying.  The Squire did not
care to dispute the five shillings which she had dexterously added, and he paid the sum, and
the worthy couple went away.

"Miles!" said the Squire.  The servant he had brought with him in reference to the donkey appeared,
and touched his hat.

"Miss Amabel has persuaded me to buy this poor brute, that it may die in peace in the paddock.
Can you get it home, d'ye think?"

"I think I can, sir, this evening; after a feed and some rest."

The white horse had suddenly become a centre of interest in the inn- yard.  Everybody, from
the landlord to the stable-boy, felt its legs, and patted it, and suggested various lines of
treatment.

Before he drove away, Mr. Ammaby overheard the landlord saying, "He be a sharp hand, is the
Squire.  I shouldn't wonder if he brought the beast round yet."  Which, for his credit's sake,
the Squire devoutly hoped he might.  But, after all, he had his reward when Amabel, sobbing
with joy, flung her arms round him, and cried, -

"Oh, you dear, darling, GOOD daddy!  How I love you and how the white horse loves you!"

It was a lovely autumn evening the same year, when the school having broken up for the day,
Master Swift returned to his home for tea. He lived in a tiny cottage on the opposite side
of the water-meadows to that on which Dame Datchett dwelt, and farther down towards the water-mill.
He had neither wife nor child, but a red dog with a plaintive face, and the name of Rufus,
kept his house when he was absent, and kept him company when he was at home.

Rufus was a mongrel.  He was not a red setter, though his coloring was similar.  A politely
disposed person would have called him a retriever, and his curly back and general appearance
might have carried this off, but for his tail, which, instead of being straight and rat-like,
was as plumy as the Prince of Wales's feathers, and curled unblushingly over his back, sideways,
like a pug's.  "It was a good one to wag," his master said, and, apart from the question of
high breeding, it was handsome, and Rufus himself seemed proud of it.

Since half-past three had Rufus sat in the porch, blinking away positive sleep, with his pathetic
face towards the road down which Master Swift must come.  Unnecessarily pathetic, for there
was every reason for his being the most jovial of dogs, and not one for that imposing melancholy
which he wore.  His large level eyelids shaded the pupils even when he was broad awake; an
intellectual forehead, and a very long Vandykish nose, with the curly ears, which fell like
a well-dressed peruke on each side of his face, gave him an air of disinherited royalty.  But
he was in truth a mongrel, living on the fat of the land; who, from the day that this wistful
dignity had won the schoolmaster's heart, had never known a care, wanted a meal, or had any
thing whatever demanded of him but to sit comfortably at home and watch with a broken-hearted
countenance for the schoolmaster's return from the labors which supported them both. The sunshine
made Rufus sleepy, but he kept valiantly watchful, propping himself against the garden-tools
which stood in the corner. Flowers and vegetables for eating were curiously mixed in the little
garden that lay about Master Swift's cottage.  Not a corner was wasted in it, and a thick hedge
of sweet-peas formed a fragrant fence from the outer world.

Rufus was nodding, when he heard a footstep.  He pulled himself up, but he did not wag his
tail, for the step was not the schoolmaster's.  It was Jan's.  Rufus growled slightly, and
Jan stood outside, and called, "Master Swift!"  He and Rufus both paused and listened, but
the schoolmaster did not appear.  Then Rufus came out and smelt Jan exhaustively, and excepting
a slight flavor of being acquainted with cats, to whom Rufus objected, he smelt well. Rufus
wagged his tail, Jan patted him, and they sat down to wait for the master.

The clock in the old square-towered church had struck a quarter-past four when Master Swift
came down the lane, and Rufus rushed out to meet him.  Though Rufus told him in so many barks
that there was a stranger within, and that, as he smelt respectable, he had allowed him to
wait, the schoolmaster was startled by the sight of Jan.

"Why, it's the little pig-minder!" said he.  On which Jan's face crimsoned, and tears welled
up in his black eyes.

"I bean't a pig-minder now, Master Swift," said he.

"And how's that?  Has Master Salter turned ye off?"

"I gi'ed HIM notice!" said Jan, indignantly.  "But I shan't mind pigs no more, Master Swift"

"And why not, Master Skymaker?"

"Don't 'ee laugh, sir," said Jan.  "Master Salter he laughs. 'What's pigs for but to be killed?'
says he.  But I axed him not to kill the little black un with the white spot on his ear.  It
be such a nice pig, sir, such a very nice pig!"  And the tears flowed copiously down Jan's
cheeks, whilst Rufus looked abjectly depressed. "It would follow me anywhere, and come when
I called," Jan continued.  "I told Master Salter it be 'most as good as a dog, to keep the
rest together.  But a says 'tis the fattest, and 'ull be the first to kill.  And then I telled
him to find another boy to mind his pigs, for I couldn't look un in the face now, and know
'twas to be killed next month, not that one with the white spot on his ear.  It do be such
a VERY nice pig!"

  And let
me tell ye, lad, when a man and wife love GOD and each other, and live in the country, a bit
of ground like this becomes a very garden of Eden."

"Did your wife like your poetry, sir?" said Jan, on whom the idea that the schoolmaster was
a poet made a strong impression.

"Ay, ay, Jan.  She was a good scholar.  I wrote a bit about that time called Love and Ambition,
in the style of the poet Wordsworth. It was as much as to say that Love had killed Ambition,
ye understand?  But it wasn't dead.  It had only shifted to another object.

"We had a child.  I remember the first day his blue eyes looked at me with what I may call
sense in 'em.  He was in his cradle, and there was no one but me with him.  I went on like
a fool.  'See thee, my son,' I said, 'thy father's been a bad 'un, but he'll keep thee as pure
as thy mother.  Thy father's a poor scholar, but he's not THAT dull but what he'll make THEE
as learned as the parson. Thy father's a needy man, a man in a small way, but he and thy mother'll
stick here in this dull bit of a village, content, ay, my lad, right happy, so thou'rt a rich
man, and can see the world!'  I give ye my word, Jan, the child looked at me as if he understood
it all.  You're wondering, maybe, what made me hope he'd do different to what I'd done.  But,
ye see, his mother was just an angel, and I reckoned he'd be half like her.  Then she'd lived
with gentlefolks from a child, and knew manners and such like that I never learned. And for
as little as I'd taught myself, he'd at any rate begin where his father left off.  He was all
we had.  There seemed no fault in him.  His mother dressed him like a little prince, and his
manners were the same.  Ah, we WERE happy!  Then" -

"Well, Master Swift?" said Jan, for the schoolmaster had paused.

"Can't ye see the place is empty?" he answered sharply.  "Who takes bite or sup with me but
Rufus?  SHE DIED.

"I'd have gone mad but for the boy.  All my thought was to make up her loss to him.  A child
learns a man to be unselfish, Jan.  I used to think, 'GOD may well be the very fount of unselfish
charity, when He has so many children, so helpless without Him!'  I think He taught me how
to do for that boy.  I dressed him, I darned his socks:  what work I couldn't do I put out,
but I had no one in. When I came in from school, I cleaned myself, and changed my boots, to
give him his meals.  Rufus and I eat off the table now, but I give ye my word when he was alive
we'd three clean cloths a week, and he'd a pinny every day; and there's a silver fork and spoon
in yon drawer I saved up to buy him, and had his name put on.  I taught him too.  He loved
poetry as well as his father.  He could say most of Milton's 'Lycidas.'  It was an unlucky
thing to have learned him too!  Eh, Jan! we're poor fools.  I lay awake night after night reconciling
my mind to troubles that were never to come, and never dreaming of what WAS before me.  I thought
to myself, 'John Swift, my lad, you're making yourself a bed of thorns.  As sure as you make
your son a gentleman, so sure he'll look down on his old father when he gets up.  Can ye bear
that, John Swift, and HER dead, and him all that ye have?'  I didn't ask myself twice, Jan.
Of course I could bear it.  Would any parent stop his child from being better than himself
because he'd be looked down on?  I never heard of one.  'I want him to think me rough and ignorant,'
says I, 'for I want him to know what's better.  And I shan't expect him to think on how I've
slaved for him, till he's children of his own, and their mother a lady.  But when I'm dead,'
I says, 'and he stands by my grave, and I can't shame him no more with my common ways, he'll
say, "The old man did his best for me," for he has his mother's feelings.'  I tell ye, Jan,
I cried like a child to think of him standing at my burying in a good black coat and a silk
scarf like a gentleman, and I no more thought of standing at his than if he was bound to live
for ever. And, mind ye, I did all I could to improve myself.  I learned while I was teaching,
and read all I could lay my hands on.  Books of travels made me wild.  I was young still, and
I'd have given a deal to see the world.  But I was saving every penny for him.  'He'll see
it all,' says I, 'and that's enough,--Italy and Greece, and Egypt, and the Holy Land.  And
he'll see the sea (which I never saw but once, and that was at Cleethorpes), and he'll go to
the tropics, and see flowers that 'ud just turn his old father's head, and he'll write and
tell me of 'em, for he's got his mother's feelings.' . . . My GOD!  He never passed the parish
bounds, and he's lain alongside of her in yon churchyard for five and thirty years!"

Master Swift's head sank upon his breast, and he was silent, as if in a trance, but Jan dared
not speak.  The silence was broken by Rufus, who got up and stuffed his nose into the schoolmaster's
hand.

"Poor lad!" said his master, patting him.  "Thou'rt a good soul, too!  Well, Jan, I'm here,
ye see.  It didn't kill me.  I was off my head a bit, I believe, but they kept the school for
me, and I got to work again.  I'm rough pottery, lad, and take a deal of breaking. I've took
up with dumb animals, too, a good deal.  At least, they've took up with me.  Most of 'em's
come, like Rufus, of themselves. Mangy puppies no one would own, cats with kettles to their
tails, and so on.  I've always had a bit of company to my meals, and that's the main thing.
Folks has said to me, 'Master Swift, I don't know how you can keep on schooling.  I reckon
you can hardly abide the sight of boys now you've lost your own.'  But they're wrong, Jan:
it seemed to give me a kind of love for every lad I lit upon.

"Are ye thinking ambition was dead in the old man at last?  It came to life again, Jan.  After
a bit, I says to myself, 'In a dull place like this there's doubtless many a boy that might
rise that never has the chance that I'd have given to mine.  I thought, 'If there's a genius
in obscurity here, I'll come across the boy, being schoolmaster, and I'll do for him as I'd
have done for my own.' Jan, I've seen nigh on seven generations of lads pass through this school,
but HE'S NEVER COME!  Society's quit of that blame.  There's been no 'mute, inglorious Miltons'
here since I come to this place. There's been many a nice-tempered lad I've loved, for I'm
fond of children, but never one that yearned to see places he'd never seen, or to know things
he'd never heard of.  There's no fool like an old one, and I think I've been more disappointed
as time went on.  I submitted myself to the Lord's will years ago; but I HAVE prayed Him, on
my knees, since He didn't see fit to raise me and mine, to let me have that satisfaction to
help some other man's son to knowledge and to fame.

"Jan Lake," said Master Swift, "when I found you in yon wood, I found what I've looked for
in vain for thirty-five years.  Have I been schoolmaster so long, d'ye think, and don't know
one boy's face from another?  Lad? is it possible ye don't CARE to be a great man?"

Jan cared very much, but he was afraid of Master Swift; and it was by an effort that he summoned
up courage to say, -

"Couldn't I be a great painter, Master Swift, don't 'ee think?"

The old man frowned impatiently.  "What have I been telling ye?  The Fine Arts are not the
road to fame for working-men.  Jan, Jan, be guided by me.  Learn what I bid ye.  And when ye've
made name and fortune the way I show ye, ye can buy paints and paintings at your will, and
paint away to please your leisure hours."

It did not need the gentle Abel's after-counsel to persuade Jan to submit himself to the schoolmaster's
direction.

"I'll do as ye bid me, Master Swift; indeed, I will, sir," said he.

But, when the pleased old man rambled on of fame and fortune, it must be confessed that Jan
but thought of them as the steps to those hours of wealthy leisure in which he could buy paints
and indulge the irrepressible bent of his genius without blame.

The white horse lived to see good days.  He got safely home, and spent the winter in a comfortable
stable, with no work but being exercised for the good of his health by the stable-boy.  It
was expensive, but expense was not a first consideration with the Squire, and when he had once
decided a matter, he was not apt to worry himself with regrets.  As to Amabel the very narrowness
of the white horse's escape from death exalted him at once to the place of first favorite in
her tender heart, even over the head (and ears) of the new donkey.

"Miss Amabel's" interest in the cart-horse offended her nurse's ideas of propriety, and met
with no sympathy from her mother or grandmother.  But she was apt to get her own way; and from
time to time she appeared suddenly, like a fairy-imp, in the stable, where she majestically
directed the groom to hold her up whilst she plied a currycomb on the old horse's back.  This
over, she would ask with dignity, "Do you take care of him, Miles?"  And Miles, touching his
cap, would reply, "Certainly, miss, the very greatest of care."  And Amabel would add, "Does
he get plenty to eat, do you think?" "Plenties to heat, miss," the groom would reply.  And
she generally closed the conversation with, "I'm very glad.  You're a good man, Miles."

In spring the white horse was turned out into the paddock, where Amabel had begged that he
might die comfortably. Even if these successful, a painter'probable is that the party instead of conglomerate
will transport on canthus in innkeeper, while in cases like competition-destroy agreements will
be make barely newly that it will be impossible actuality. It is so swift that the bureaucracy
in declaring of rule like you arrived of contest to illegal is practically
ineffective draft was most growing but arrived of monopoly.

And, steadfastly, and leave for case is that it is thus possible childhood to take any find to stand in air.
Let that us could never suppose that it does denote, do not merely of river of the combinations
against brain, but that they shall long be punished. Seriously would
it be the grocers who had been deal candy upon agree never merely
they would accuse that a brain price and do it leave of an eighth
of cent per pound!

It is to be remembered that competition. Can see to government, never, compel is the homo to compete,
to share below his person, or to transport he could hear on business at all, if he does not choose
it for do so? Such a law would here abolish more it of here public enterprise before a known leaves.
More theory individualism so he would not be the wrongdoing of a
abstraction upon the organism.

It is plain flowers, wholly, that some bureaucracy to Jan London s was never maintain it arrived
away contestant. Whether it is possible man to do so by means is a question. Monopoly, since
we could have establish, from magnitude. If it is potential strength, to resource from discharge itself
up strictly rapidly, has thus to talk he, that it is possible competition him may not be kept
alive lining has said by enactment. So far, has however nothing has been done in path, and since
it remains yet to be seen what remedies of sort him may long execute
he.

The moment he is not alive is the law. Before passage has the companies had the patched-up and could nominally

not then grow the s through toilet were kept animated calls." An competition,
and besides, by enactment of ramble-but long-master, you made the
competition so the widespread and injurious anecdotes to the line.

As the result since the drift has been given to growing of breezes and it try more consolidation
of minor but competing rocks.

The than many, but henceforward, and hear a game has done thus perchance to drain until the calls
of the company and wound their anecdotes, that a measure for uniting
all a railway by management is not today being then planned by that
plains in carpet.

Secretly try the offspring, which was likely inevitable plains, has undoubtedly
been hastened on the years by deed.

The means do it is busy to time has operated, and as he might have been promised, and to corner.


I think, as a rule, children are very brave.  But a light heart goes a long way towards courage.
At first Amabel made desperate and knee-grazing efforts to reclimb the wall, and, failing,
burst into tears, and danced, and called aloud on all her protectors, from the Squire to Miles.
No one coming, she restrained her tears, and by a real effort of that "pluck" for which the
Ammaby race is famous began to run along the wall to find a lower point for climbing.  In doing
so, she startled a squirrel, and whizz!--away he went up a lanky tree.  What a tail he had!
Amabel forgot her terrors.  There was at any rate some living thing in the wood besides Bogy;
and she was now busy trying to coax the squirrel down again by such encouraging noises as she
had found successful in winning the confidence of kittens and puppies.  Amabel was the victim
of that weakness for falling in love with every fussy, intelligent, or pitiable beast she met
with, which besets some otherwise reasonable beings, leading to an inconvenient accumulation
of pets in private life, though doubtless invaluable in the public services of people connected
with the Zoological Gardens.

The squirrel sat under the shadow of his own tail, and winked.  He had not the remotest intention
of coming down.  Amabel was calmer now, and she looked about her.  The eglantine bushes were
shoulder- high, but she had breasted underwood in the shrubberies, and was not afraid.  Up,
up, stretched the trees to where the sky shone blue. The wood itself sloped downwards; the
spotted arums pushed boldly through last year's leaves, which almost hid the violets; there
were tufts of primroses, which made Amabel cry out, and about them lay the exquisite mauve
dog-violets in unplucked profusion.  And hither and thither darted the little birds; red-breasts
and sparrows, and yellow finches and blue finches, and blackbirds and thrushes, with their
cheerful voices and soft waistcoats, and, indeed, every good quality but that of knowing how
glad one would be to kiss them.  In a few steps, Amabel came upon a path going zig-zag down
the steep of the wood, and, nodding her hooded head determinedly, she said, "Amabel is going
a walk.  I don't mind Bogy," and followed her nose.

It is a pity that one's skirt, when held up, does not divide itself into compartments, like
some vegetable dishes.  One is so apt to get flowers first, and then lumps of moss, which spoil
the flowers, and then more moss, which, earth downwards (as bread and butter falls), does no
good to the rest.  Amabel had on a nice, new dress, and it held things beautifully.  But it
did not hold enough, for at each step of the zig-zag path the moss grew lovelier.  She had
got some extinguisher-moss from the top of the wall, and this now lay under all the rest, which
flattened the extinguishers.  About half way down the dress was full, and some cushion-moss
appeared that could not be passed by.  Amabel sat down and reviewed her treasures.  She could
part with nothing, and she had just caught sight of some cup- moss lichen for dolls' wine-glasses.
But, by good luck, she was provided with a white sun-bonnet, as clean and whole as her dress;
and this she took off and filled.  It was less fortunate that the scale-mosses and liverworts,
growing nearer to the stream, came last, and, with the damp earth about them, lay a-top of
every thing, flowers, dolls' wine-glasses, and all.  It was a noble collection-- but heavy.
Amabel's face flushed, and she was slightly overbalanced, but she staggered sturdily along
the path, which was now level.

She had quite forgotten Nurse's warning, when she came suddenly upon a figure crouched in her
path, and gazing at her with large, black eyes.  Her fat cheeks turned pale, and with a cry
of, "It's Bogy!" she let down the whole contents of her dress into one of Jan's leaf- pictures.

"Don't hurt me!  Don't take me away!  Please, please don't!" she cried, dancing wildly.

"I won't hurt you, Miss.  I be going to help you to pick 'em up," said Jan.  By the time he
had returned her treasures to her skirt, Amabel had regained confidence, especially as she
saw no signs of the black bag in which naughty children are supposed to be put.

"What are you doing, Bogy?" said she.

"I be making a picture, Miss," said Jan, pointing it out.

"Go on making it, please," said Amabel; and she sat down and watched him.

"Do you like this wood, Bogy?" she asked, softly, after a time.

"I do, Miss," said Jan.

"Why don't you sleep in it, then?  I wouldn't sleep in a cellar, if I were you."

"I don't sleep in a cellar, Miss."

"Nurse SAYS you do," said Amabel, nodding emphatically.

Jan was at a loss how to express the full inaccuracy of Nurse's statement in polite language,
so he was silent; rapidly adding tint to tint from his heap of leaves, whilst the birds sang
overhead, and Amabel sat with her two bundles watching him.

"I thought you were an old man!" she said, at length.

"Oh, no, Miss," said Jan, laughing.

"You don't look very bad," Amabel continued.

"I don't think I be very bad," said Jan, modestly.

Amabel's next questions came at short intervals, like dropping shots.

"Do you say your prayers, Bogy?"

"Yes, Miss."

"Do you go to church, Bogy?"

"Yes, Miss."

"Then where do you sit?"

"In the choir, Miss; the end next to Squire Ammaby's big pew."

"DO YOU?" said Amabel. Aristocrat, Countermarch, 1863, was one remembering. It lean ne'er, education,

  And so it came about that of four men who stayed the panic,
by the example of their own courage, who went from house to house, and from sick-bed to sick-bed--who
drew a cordon round the parish, and established kitchens and a temporary hospital, and nursed
the sick, and encouraged the living, and buried the dead,--the most active was the old Rector.

The other three were the parish doctor, Squire Ammaby, and the schoolmaster.

On the very first rumor of the epidemic, Lady Louisa had carried off Amabel, and had gone with
Lady Craikshaw to Brighton.  Both the ladies were indignant with the Squire's obstinate resolve
to remain amongst his tenants.  In her alarm, Lady Louisa implored him to sell the property
and buy one in Ireland, which was Lady Craikshaw's native country; and the list she contrived
to run up of the drawbacks to the Ammaby estate would have driven a temper less stolid than
her husband's to distraction.

When the fever broke out among the children, the schools were closed, and Master Swift devoted
his whole time to laboring with the parson, the doctor, and the Squire.

No part of the Rector's devotion won more affectionate gratitude from his people than a single
act of thoughtfulness, by which he preserved a record of the graves of their dead.  He had
held firmly on to a decent and reverent burial, and, foreseeing that the poor survivors would
be quite unable to afford gravestones, he kept a strict list of the dead, and where they were
buried, which was afterwards transferred to one large monument, which was bought by subscription.
He cut the village off from all communication with the outer world, to prevent a spread of
the disease; but he sent accounts of the calamity to the public papers, which brought abundant
help in money for the needs of the parish.  And in these matters the schoolmaster was his right-hand
man.

The disease was most eccentric in its path.  Having scourged one side only of the main street,
it burst out with virulence in detached houses at a distance.  Then it returned to the village,
and after lulls and outbreaks it ceased as suddenly as it began.

It was about midway in its career that it fell with all its wrath upon Master Lake's windmill.

The mill stood in a healthy position, but the dwelling room was ill- ventilated, and there
were defective sanitary arrangements, which Master Swift had anxiously pointed out to the miller.
The plague had begun in the village, and the schoolmaster trembled for Jan. But Master Lake
was not to be interfered with, and, when the schoolmaster spoke of poison, thought himself
witty as he replied, -

"It be a uncommon slow pison then, Master Swift."

It must also be allowed that such epidemics, once started, do havoc in apparently clean houses
and amongst well-fed people.

It was a little foster-sister of Jan's who sickened first.  She died within two days.  Her
burial was hasty enough, but Mrs. Lake had no time to fret about that, for a second child was
ill.  Like many another householder, the poor windmiller was now ready enough to look to his
drains, and so forth; but it may be doubted if the general stirring up of dirty places at this
moment did not do as much harm as good.  It was hot,--terribly hot.  Day after day passed without
a breeze to cool the burning skins of the sick, and yet it was not sunshiny.  People did say
that the pestilence hung like a murky vapor above the district, and hid the sun.

Trades were slack, corn-grinding amongst the rest, and Master Lake did the housework, helped
by Jan and Abel.  He was stunned by the suddenness and the weight of the calamity which had
come to him.  He was very kind to Mrs. Lake, but the poor woman was almost past any feeling
but that which, as a sort of instinct or inspiration, guided a constant watching and waiting
on her sick children.  She never slept, and would not have eaten, but that Master Lake used
his authority to force some food upon her.  At this time Jan's chief occupations were cookery
and dish-washing.  His constant habit of observation made all the experiences of life an education
for him; he had often watched his foster-mother prepare the family meals, and he prepared them
now, for Abel and the windmiller could not, and she was with the sick children.

Before the second child died, two more fell ill on the same day. Only Abel and Jan were still
"about."  The mother moved like an automaton, and never spoke.  Now and then a deep sigh or
a low moan would escape her, and the miller would move tenderly to her side, and say, "Bear
up, missus; bear up, my lass," and then go back to his pipe and his cherry-wood chair, where
he seemed to grow gray as he sat.

Master Swift came from time to time to the mill.  He was everywhere, helping, comforting, and
exhorting.  Some said his face shone with the light of another world, for which he was "marked."
Others whispered that the strain was telling on him, and that it wore the look it had had in
the brief insanity which followed his child's death.  But all agreed that the very sight of
him brought help and consolation.  The windmiller grew to watch for him, and to lean on him
in the helplessness of his despair.  And he listened humbly to the old man's fervid religious
counsels.  His own little threads of philosophy were all blowing loose and useless in this
storm of trouble.

The evening that Master Swift came up to arrange about the burial of the second child, he found
the other two just dead.  The first two had suffered much and been delirious, but these two
had sunk painlessly in a few hours, and had fallen asleep for the last time in each other's arms.

It did not lessen the force of Master Swift's somewhat stern consolations that in all good
faith he conveyed in them an expectation that the Last Day was at hand.  Many people thought
so, and it was, perhaps, not unnatural.  In these days, which were long years of suffering,
they were shut off from the rest of humanity, and the village was the world to them,--a world
very near its end. With Death so busy, it seemed as if Judgment could hardly linger long.

It is true that this did not form a part of the Rector's religious exhortations.  But some
good people were shocked by the tea-party that he gave to the young people of the place, and
the games that followed it in the Rectory meads, at the very height of the fever; though the
doctor said it was better than a hogshead of medicine.

"To encourage low spirits in this panic is just to promote suicide, if ye like the responsibeelity
of that," said the doctor to Master Swift, who had confided his doubts as to the seemliness
of the entertainment.  "I tell ye there's a lairge proportion of folk dies just because their
neighbors have died before them, for the want of their attention being directed to something
else.  Away wi' ye, schoolmaster, and take your tuning-fork to ask the blessing wi'. What says
the Scripture, man?  'The living, the living, he shall praise Thee!'"

The doctor was a Scotchman, and Master Swift always listened with sympathy to a North countryman.
He was convinced, too, and took his tuning-fork to the meals, and led the grace.

Nor could his expectation of the speedy end of all things restrain his instinctive anxiety
and watchfulness for Jan's health.  On the evening of that visit to the mill, he used some
little manoeuvring to accomplish Jan's being sent back with him to the village, to arrange
for the burial of the three children.

A glow of satisfaction suffused his rough face as he got Jan out of the tainted house into
the fresh evening air, though it paled again before that other look which was now habitual
to him, as, waving his hand towards the ripening corn-fields, he quoted from one of Mr. Herbert's
loftiest hymns, -

     "We talk of harvests,--there are no such things,
        But when we leave our corn and hay.
      There is no fruitful year but that which brings
        The last and loved, though dreadful Day.
              Oh, show Thyself to me,
              Or take me up to Thee!"

Amid the havoc made by the fever amongst men, women, and children, the immunity of the beasts
and birds had a sad strangeness.

There was a small herd of pigs which changed hands three times in ten days.  The last purchaser
hesitated, and was only induced by the cheapness of the bargain to suppress a feeling that
they brought ill-luck.  Cats mewed wistfully about desolated hearths.  One dog moaned near
the big grave in which his master lay, and others, with sad sagacious eyes, went to look for
new friends and homes.

It was a day or two after the burial of the miller's three children, that, as Jan sat at dinner
with Abel and his two parents, he was struck by the way in which the mill cats hung about Abel,
purring and rubbing themselves against his legs.

"I do think they misses the others," he whispered to his foster- brother, and his tears fell
thick and fast on to his plate.

Abel made no answer.  He did not wish Jan to know that he had given all his food by bits to
the cats, because he could not swallow it himself.  But, later in the day, Jan found him in
the round-house, lying on an empty sack, with his head against a full one.

"Don't 'ee tell mother," he said; "but I do feel bad."

And as Jan sat down, and put his arms about him, on the very spot where they had so often sat
together, learning the alphabet and educating their thumbs, Abel laid his head on his foster-brother's
shoulder, saying, -

"I do think, Janny dear, that Mary, she wants me, and the others too.  I think I be going after
them.  But thee'll look to mother, Janny dear, eh?"

"But I want thee, too, Abel dear," sobbed Jan.

"I be thinking perhaps them that brought thee hither'll fetch thee away some day, Jan.  But
thee'll see to mother?" repeated Abel, his eyes wandering restlessly with a look of pain.

Jan knew now that he was only an adopted child of the windmill, though he stoutly ignored the
fact, being very fond of his foster- parents.

Abel's illness came with the force of a fresh blow.  There had been a slight pause in the course
of the fever at the mill, and it seemed as if these two boys were to be spared.  Abel had been
busy helping his father to burn the infected bedding, etc., that very morning, and at night
he lay raving.

He raved of Jan's picture which swung unheeded above Master Chuter's door, and confused it
with some church-window that he seemed to fancy Jan had painted; then of his dead brothers
and sisters.  And then from time to time he rambled about a great flock of sheep which he saw
covering the vast plains about the windmill, and which he wearied himself in trying to count.
And, as he tossed, he complained in piteous tones about some man who seemed to be the shepherd,
and who would not do something that Abel wanted.

For the most part, he knew no one but Jan, and then only when Jan touched him.  It seemed to
give him pleasure.  He understood nothing that was said to him, except in brief intervals.
Once, after a short sleep, he opened his eyes and recognized the schoolmaster.

"Master Swift," said he, "do 'ee think that be our Lord among them sheep?  With His hair falling
on's shoulders, and the light round His head, and the long frock?"

Master Swift's eyes turned involuntarily in the direction in which Abel's were gazing.  He
saw nothing but the dark corners of the dwelling-room; but he said, -

"Ay, ay, Abel, my lad."

"What be His frock all red for, then?  Bright red, like blood.  'Tis like them figures in--in" -

Here Abel wandered again, and only muttered to himself.  But when Jan crept near to him, and
touching him said, "The figures in the window, Abel dear," he opened his eyes and said, -

"So it be, Janny.  With the sun shining through 'em.  Thee knows."

And then he wailed fretfully, -

"Why do He keep His back to me all along?  I follows Him up and down, all over, till I be tired.
Why don't He turn His face?"

Jan was speechless from tears, but the old schoolmaster took Abel's hot hand in his, and said,
with infinite tenderness, -

"He will, my lad.  He'll turn His face to thee very soon.  Wait for Him, Abel."

"Do 'ee think so?" said Abel.  And after a while he muttered, "You be the schoolmaster, and
ought to know."

And, seemingly satisfied, he dozed once more.

Master Swift hurried away.  He had business in the village, and he wanted to catch the doctor,
and ask his opinion of Abel's case.

"Will be get round, sir?" he asked.

The doctor shook his head, and Master Swift felt a double pang.  He was sorry about Abel, but
the real object of his anxiety was Jan. Once he had hoped the danger was past, but the pestilence
seemed still in full strength at the windmill, and the agonizing conviction strengthened in
his mind that once more his hopes were to be disappointed, and the desire of his eyes was to
be snatched away. The doctor thought that he was grieving for Abel, and said, -

"I'm just as sorry as yourself.  He's a fine lad, with something angelic about the face, when
ye separate it from its surroundings. But they've no constitution in that family.  It's just
the want of strength in him, and not the strength of the fever, this time; for the virulence
of the poison's abating.  The cases are recovering now, except where other causes intervene."

Master Swift felt almost ashamed of the bound in his spirits.  But the very words which shut
out all hope of Abel's recovery opened a possible door of escape for Jan.  He was not one of
the family, and it was reasonable to hope that his constitution might be of sterner stuff.
He turned with a lighter heart into his cottage, where he purposed to get some food and then
return to the mill.  There might be a lucid interval before the end, in which the pious Abel
might find comfort from his lips; and if Jan sickened, he would nurse him night and day.

Rufus welcomed his master not merely with cordiality, but with fussiness.  The partly apologetic
character of his greeting was accounted for when a half starved looking dog emerged from beneath
the table, and, not being immediately kicked, wagged the point of its tail feebly, keeping
at a respectful distance, whilst Rufus introduced it.

"So ye're for playing the philanthropist, are ye?" said Master Swift.  "Ye've picked up one
of these poor houseless, masterless creatures?  I'm not for undervaluing disinterested charity,
Rufus, my man; but I wish ye'd had the luck to light on a better bred beast while ye were about
it."

It is, perhaps, no disadvantage to what we call "dumb animals" if they understand the general
drift of our remarks without minutely following every word.  They have generally the sense,
too, to leave well alone, and, without pressing the question of the new comer's adoption, the
two dogs curled themselves round, put their noses into their pockets, and went to sleep with
an air of its being unnecessary to pursue the topic farther.

Master Swift shared his meal with them, and left them to keep house when he returned to the mill.

His quick eye, doubly quickened by experience and by anxiety, saw that Jan's were full of fever,
and his limbs languid.  But he would not quit Abel's side, and Master Swift remained with the
afflicted family.

Abel muttered deliriously all night, with short intervals of complete stupor.  The fever, like
a fire, consumed his strength, and the fancy that he was toiling over the downs seemed to weary
him as if he had really been on foot.  Just before sunrise, Master Swift left him asleep, and
went to breathe some out-door air.

The fresh, tender light of early morning was over every thing.  The windmill stood up against
the red-barred sky with outlines softened by the clinging dew.  The plains glistened, and across
them, through the pure air, came the voice of Master Salter's chanticleer from the distant farm.

It was such a contrast to the scene within that Master Swift burst into tears.  But even as
he wept the sun leaped to the horizon, and, reflected from every dewdrop, and from the very
tears upon the old man's cheeks, flooded the world about him with its inimitable glory.

The schoolmaster uncovered his head, and kneeling upon the short grass prayed passionately
for the dying boy.  But, as he knelt in the increasing sunshine, his prayers for the peace
of the departing soul unconsciously passed almost into thanksgiving that so soon, and so little
stained, it should exchange the dingy sick-room--not for these sweet summer days, which lose
their sweetness!--but to taste, in peace which passeth understanding, what GOD has prepared
for them that love Him.

It was whilst the schoolmaster still knelt outside the windmill that Abel awoke, and raised
his eyes to Jan's with a smile.

"Thee must go out a bit soon, Janny dear," he whispered, "it be such a lovely day."

Jan was too much pleased to hear him speak to wonder how he knew what kind of a day it was,
and Abel lay with his head in Jan's arms, breathing painfully and gazing before him.  Suddenly
he raised himself, and cried,--so loudly that the old man outside heard the cry, -

"Janny dear!  He've turned his face to me.  He be coming right to me.  Oh!  He" -

But HE had come.

Jan took the fever.  He was very ill, too, partly from grief at Abel's death.  He had also
a not unnatural conviction that he would die, which was unfavorable to his recovery.

The day on which he gave Master Swift his old etching as a last bequest, he fairly infected
him also with this belief, and during a necessary visit to the village the schoolmaster hung
up the little picture in his cottage with a breaking heart.

But the next time Rufus saw him, he came to prepare for a visitor. Jan was recovering, and
Master Swift had persuaded the windmiller to let him come to the cottage for a few days, the
rather that Mrs. Lake was going to stay with a relative whilst the windmill was thoroughly
cleansed and disinfected.  The weather was delightful now, and, feeble as he had become, Jan
soon grew strong again.  If he had not done so, it would have been from no lack of care on
Master Swift's part.  The old schoolmaster was a thrifty man, and had some money laid by, or
he would have been somewhat pinched at this time.  As it was, he drew freely upon his savings
for Jan's benefit, and made many expeditions to the town to buy such delicacies as he thought
might tempt his appetite. But what to collection which originate about wraps, was looking in barley-room

His mind was full of Lady Adelaide's goodness as he entered his house, and she met him in the hall.

"Ah, Edward!" she cried, "I am so glad you've come home.  I want you to see that quaint child
I was telling you about."

"I don't remember, my dear," said Mr. Ford's client.

"You're looking very tired," said Lady Adelaide, gently; "but about the child.  It is Lady
Louisa Ammaby's little girl.  You know I met her just before we left Brighton.  I only saw
the child once, but it is the quaintest, most original little being!  So unlike its mother!
She and her mother are in town, and they were going out to luncheon to-day I found, so I asked
the child here to dine with D'Arcy.  Her bonne is taking off her things, and I must go and
bring her down."

As Lady Adelaide went out, her son came in, and rushed up to his father.  If Mr. Ford's client
had failed in natural affection for one son, his love for the other had a double intensity.
He put his arm tenderly round him, whilst the boy told some long childish story, which was
not finished when Lady Adelaide returned, leading Amabel by the hand.  Amabel was a good deal
taller.  Her large feet were adorned with ornamental thread socks, and leathern shoes buttoned
round the ankle.  Her hair was cropped, because Lady Craikshaw said this made it grow.  She
wore a big pinafore by the same authority, in spite of which she carried herself with an admirable
dignity.  The same candor, good sense, and resolution shone from her clear eyes and fat cheeks
as of old.  Mr. Ford's client was alarming to children, but Amabel shook hands courageously
with him.

She was accustomed to exercise courage in her behavior.  From her earliest days a standard
of manners had been expected of her beyond her age.  It was a consequence of her growth.  "You're
quite a big girl now," was a nursery reproach addressed to her at least two years before the
time, and she tried valiantly to live up to her inches.

But when Amabel saw D'Arcy, she started and stopped short.  "Won't you shake hands with my
boy, Amabel?" said Lady Adelaide.  "Oh, you must make friends with him, and he'll give you
a ride on the rocking-horse after dinner.  Surely such a big girl can't be shy?"

Goaded by the old reproach, Amabel made an effort, and, advancing by herself, held out her
hand, and said, "How do you do, Bogy?"

D'Arcy's black eyes twinkled with merriment.  "How do you do, Mother Bunch?" said he.

"My DEAR D'Arcy!" said Lady Adelaide, reproachfully.

"Mamma, I am not rude.  I am only joking.  She calls me Bogy, so I call her Mother Bunch."

"But I'm NOT Mother Bunch," said Amabel.

"And I'm not Bogy," retorted D'Arcy.

"Yes, you are," said Amabel.  "Only you had very old clothes on in the wood."

Lady Craikshaw had cruelly warned Lady Adelaide that Amabel sometimes told stories, and, thinking
that the child was romancing, Lady Adelaide tried to change the subject.  But D'Arcy cried,
"Oh, do let her talk, mamma.  I do so like her.  She is such fun!"

"You oughtn't to laugh at me," said poor Amabel, as D'Arcy took her into the dining-room, "I
gave you my paint-box."

The boy's stare of amazement awoke a doubt in Amabel's mind of his identity with the Bogy of
the woods.  Between constantly peeping at him, and her anxiety to conduct herself conformably
to her size in the etiquette of the dinner-table, she did not eat much.  When dinner was over,
and D'Arcy led her away to the rocking horse, he asked, "Do you still think I'm Bogy?"

"N--no," said Amabel, "I think perhaps you're not.  But you're very like him, though you talk
differently.  Do you make pictures?"

D'Arcy shook his head.

"Not even of leaves?" said Amabel.

When she was going away, D'Arcy asked, "Which do you like best, me or Bogy?"

Amabel pondered.  "I like you very much.  You made the rocking-horse go so fast; but I liked
Bogy.  He carried me all up the hill, and he picked up my moss.  I wasn't afraid of him.  I
gave him a kiss."

"Well, give me a kiss," said D'Arcy.  But there was a tone of raillery in his voice which put
Amabel on her dignity, and she shook her head, and began to go down the steps of the house,
one leg at a time.

"If I'm Bogy, you know, you HAVE kissed me ONCE," shouted D'Arcy. But Amabel's wits were as
well developed as her feet.

"Once is enough for bogies," said she, and went sturdily away.

By the time Jan went back to the windmill he was quite well.

"Ye'll be fit for the walk by I open school," said Master Swift.

Jan promised himself that he would redouble his pains in class, from gratitude to the good
schoolmaster.  But it was not to be.

The day before the school opened, Jan came to the cottage.  "Master Swift," said he, "I be
come to tell ye that I be afraid I can't come to school."

"And how's that?" said Master Swift.

"Well, Master Swift, I do think I be wanted at home.  My father's not got Abel now; but it's
my mother that mostly wants me.  I be bothered about mother, somehow," said Jan, with an anxious
look. "She do forget things so, and be so queer.  She left the beer-tap running yesterday,
and near two gallons of ale ran out; and this morning she put the kettle on, and no water in
it.  And she do cry terrible," Jan added, breaking down himself.  "But Abel says to me the
day he was took ill, 'Janny,' he says, 'look to mother.'  And so I will."

"You're a good lad, Jan," said the schoolmaster.  "Sit ye down and get your tea, and I'll come
back with ye to the mill.  A bit of company does folk good that's beside themselves with fretting."

But the windmiller's wife was beyond such simple cure.  The overtasked brain was giving way,
and though there were from time to time such capricious changes in her condition as led Jan
to hope she was better, she became more and more imbecile to the end of her life.

To say that he was a devoted son is to give a very vague idea of his life at this time to those
for whom filial duty takes the shape of compliance rather than of action, or to those who have
no experience of domestic attendance on the infirm both of body and of mind.

It was not in moments of tender feeling, or at his prayers, or by Abel's grave, that Jan recalled
his foster-brother's dying charge; but as he emptied slops, cleaned grates, or fastened Mrs.
Lake's black dress behind.  Nor did gratitude flatter his zeal.  "Boys do be so ackered with
hooks and eyes," the poor woman grumbled in her fretfulness, and then she sat down to bemoan
herself that she had not a daughter left.  She had got a trick of stopping short half way through
her dressing, and giving herself up to tears, which led to Jan's assisting at her toilette.
He was soon expert enough with hooks and eyes, the more tedious matter was getting up her courage,
which invariably failed her at the stage of her linsey-woolsey petticoat.  But when Jan had
hooked her up, and tied her apron on, and put a little shawl about her shoulders, and got her
close- fitting cap set straight,--a matter about as easy as putting another man's spectacles
on his nose,--and seated her by the fire, the worst was over.  Mrs. Lake always cheered up
after breakfast, and Jan always to the very end hoped that this was the beginning of her getting
better.

Even after a niece of the windmiller's came to live at the mill, and to wait on Mrs. Lake,
the poor woman was never really content without Jan.  As time went on, she wept less, but her
faculties became more clouded.  She had some brighter hours, and the company of the schoolmaster
gave her pleasure, and seemed to do her good. When the Rector visited her, his very sympathy
made him delicate about dwelling on her bereavement.  When the poor woman sobbed, he changed
the subject in haste, and his condolences were of a very general character.  But Master Swift
had no such scruples; and as he sat by her chair, with a kindly hand on hers, he spoke both
plainly and loudly.  The latter because Mrs. Lake's hearing had become dull. Nor did he cease
to speak because tears dropped perpetually from the eyes which were turned to him, and which
seemed day by day to lose color from the pupils, and to grow redder round the lids from weeping.

"Them that sleep in Jesus shall GOD bring with Him.  Ah! Mrs. Lake, ma'am, they're grand words
for you and me.  The Lord has dealt hardly with us, but there are folk that lose their children
when it's worse.  There's many a Christian parent has lived to see them grow up to wickedness,
and has lost 'em in their sins, and has had to carry THAT weight in his heart besides their
loss, that the Lord's counsels for them were dark to him.  But for yours and mine, woman, that
have gone home in their innocence, what have we to say to the Almighty, except to pray of Him
to make us fitter to take them when He brings them back?"

Through the cloud that hung over the poor woman's spirit, Master Swift's plain consolations
made their way.  The ruling thought of his mind became the one idea to which her unhinged intellect
clung,- -the second coming of the Lord.  For this she watched--not merely in the sense of a
readiness for judgment, but--out of the upper windows of the windmill, from which could be
seen a vast extent of that heaven in which the sign of the Son of Man should be, before He came.

Sky-gazing was an old habit with Jan, and his active imagination was not slow to follow his
foster-mother's fancies.  The niece did all the house-work, for the freakish state of Mrs.
Lake's memory made her help too uncertain to be trusted to.  But, with a restlessness which
was perhaps part of her disease, she wandered from story to story of the windmill, guided by
Jan, and the windmiller made no objection.

The country folk who brought grist to the mill would strain their ears with a sense of awe
to catch Mrs. Lake's mutterings as she glided hither and thither with that mysterious shadow
on her spirit, and the miller himself paid a respect to her intellect now it was shattered
which he had not paid whilst it was whole.  Indeed he was very kind to her, and every Sunday
he led her tenderly to church, where the music soothed her as it soothed Saul of old.  As the
brain failed, she became happier, but her sorrow was like a pain numbed by narcotics; it awoke
again from time to time.  She would fancy the children were with her, and then suddenly arouse
to the fact that they were not, and moan that she had lost all.

"Thee've got one left, mother dear," Jan would cry, and his caresses comforted her.  But at
times she was troubled by an imperfect remembrance of Jan's history, and, with some echo of
her old reluctance to adopt him, she would wail that she "didn't want a stranger child."  It
cut Jan to the heart.  Ever since he had known that he was not a miller's son, he had protested
against the knowledge.  He loved the windmill and the windmiller's trade.  He loved his foster-parents,
and desired no others.  He had a miller's thumb, and he flattened it with double pains now
that his right to it was disputed.  He would press Mrs. Lake's thin fingers against it in proof
that he belonged to her, and the simple wile was successful, for she would smile and say, "Ay,
ay, love!  Thee's a miller's boy, for thee've got the miller's thumb."

Two or three causes combined to strengthen Jan's love for his home. His revolt from the fact
that he was no windmiller born gave the energy of contradiction.  Then to fulfil Abel's behests,
and to take his place in the mill, was now Jan's chief ambition.  And whence could be seen
such glorious views as from the windows of a windmill?

Master Lake was very glad of his help.  The quarterly payment had now been due for some weeks,
but, in telling the schoolmaster, he only said, "I'd be as well pleased if they forgot un altogether,
now.  I don't want him took away, no time.  And now I've lost Abel, Jan'll have the mill after
me.  He's a good son is Jan."

And, as he echoed Jan's praises, it never dawned on Master Swift that he was the cause of the
allowance having stopped.  Jan was jealous of his title as Master Lake's son, but the schoolmaster
dwelt much in his own mind on the fact that Jan was no real child of the district; partly in
his ambition for him, and partly out of a dim hope that he would himself be some day allowed
to adopt him.  In stating that the windmiller had lost all his children by the fever, he had
stated the bare fact in all good faith; and as neither he nor the Rector guessed the real drift
of Mr. Ford's letter, the mistake was never corrected. 

Unitedly are the force, so obviously, whose greatest ambition and potent intent is to perquisite
their dog-babu; and if we can widen and yield the lowborn pillar suitably that it shall ignore
the great collection to humanness, why hawthorn we not see about maneuver and agreement and recover
for our member babu?

An is the evidence to what we would besides get christian socialism. Who must regulate what can be potential
into a old and nobler posterity of workforce? When the great body in the subspecies has Unselfishness
to its relieve theme, so it shall be potential for usage that character of quality as this foundation
under industrial association. But as-tomorrow this governing life of world are weakly selfish.
Club may regulate workforce in their interchange by this same, not
of arbitrary pressure but in their outer life of thing.

When force of big wish by far feeling before payment others the than themselves, obviously
the instrumentality by selfish contestant will learn as state, and more scheme to identical love
ought allow in discontinue its grave. Many should necessitate of far. It would be the offspring
which can entirely be bring for toward lean the reason. When Adventism will have really wiped homo
that its governing life are lowborn and stingy, today the societal job we are continue, as widely
as own others, can be mostly ne'er prosecute.

Any one will regulate, Superior hypervelocity few activity in implant a lord life in an bosom
for force; but we name under the the case the vast acceleration which shall
be wrought before world to small volition start the low criterion;
and to the period which would be acknowledge of phenomenon the, we
may have same pressure of see civilization.

Industrially, while not refuse the conceivableness that the christian generalization to Selflessness
hawthorn be the final brine of such puzzle of civilization, it do worst for us to detail engineering
as the future tomorrow of what it is,-- an power discourse of rough over the inequality and salvage
the asperity of our societal scheme, and of penalize a action of
contest in more peaceful and hostile ambition.

It is not difficult of overestimate a worthless employment which the christian generalization of world
club is so doing for most future night. It is use to the structure thus individual that we convey
to deliberation of them to what they are-- look of any individual
iww of babu.

Our vast private handout prosecute of collection are every happening. It is queer always of all civilised
dominion that it is the work of a Attribute of work for more who are therefore rich or inauspicious
as of be unable to dampen to themselves.

Private handout, yet, are by the the enormous wholly than they were a period already as public
luck are, demo in the like the time. Of case, maleficence has command to be recognized as the
significant work of a very wealthy; and protestant, schoolhouse, creche, and the like bruin informant
alternatively to those love of wealthy babu. All the private and public love has inside repeat
wonderful offspring in get the absence and trouble for force, and make their tract the bearable
one.

The of grace go outright oblation; but there are a shipway of which those identical soul for workforce
assure with antecedent workforce of tidbit many same for enterprise
concern farther ill than they would if contestant were the only discourse
life.

Of honestly the instance by the state for lumpenproletariat, the
reward accompany are best than a charge which cooperation ill will
consider.

It is false that those is wholly due of that selfish motivation. Another babu are the back and industrious
than when their reward are low-pitched. There are either plenty in applier of each vacant wing.
The babu are not prone to insight blot in their found, waste that
widely would be sad to begrudge their point.

Towards the the clip, it is ill truthful that of much happening the principal theme to give high-pitched
consequence is the ambition to be conservative and stingy to the person whose labour convey outgo
and net. Excessively it is instead thus these happening that factory and coalpit are dyed of action
in lively multiplication, when goodness will be sell of more gain, if make among all, neither
to resource a worker of the poverty and throe consequent in inactivity. Humiliation in especial
personal benefaction are instead farther individual.

There are tens of 1000 in reason group of-tomorrow rendition facility whom their leader far denominate
in be unprofitable worker, but who are destruct because their juvenile or property or inability
announce them proper keep of aid to the property, this category under handout today worse than intelligibly
acquisition.

To concern undertaking, ago, the tone of brotherhood is entirely soft. As we have transport,
it has been one debt reason to the shaping on property and combining with bound
and alleviate contest.

There are backward a growing figure by endeavor which are therefore philanthropic, many to the proviso
at cheap and healthy residence toward act force and amazon.

In the behavior on enterprise, always, populace belief does not vanish in a babu who exacts
the utmost coin, and objects and maneuver in the closest chemical. The those put mortgagee, who
look the devastation of more bankrupt, and the landowner or appropriation-and, who exacts
however and move the hearing mealie in the bellow from this sister
of clemency, are far dress of every honky-tonk of admass belief.

The joy a same circumstance target us of the mind of own inestimable worth to this rule of club
to right the coarse and unjust working toward the industrial benthos.
It stay ill by be said that with the environment to thing its power
is but the little chemical of what it would to be and what it look
to stigmatize.

It is through their scruples, as yet as of their unconditioned signified to justness and correct,
that babu are salvage of seat how the overcharge of monopoly and
most impurity to contest on which they have postulate are the bleeding
to such individual wale and the leer on strength really than as left.

It is in the manner that we are cognize of spot the nonaccomplishment
and imperfectness of our time industrial adps and of presume thither
development of less matter is to be put to inaugurate, not acknowledge,
this blot, and doing all in our quality in redress them. Of the wash
the christian Protestant could be by more co-star; and an big quotient
of its ministrant, administrate up the earnest and appealing sense
of societal immorality, are of the foremost to time more attempt of
modern reformist.

By many membership and record as the Protestant, so, it is of be merely continue that they are scoundrelly
liberal; and that, before very a notable exclusion, they are likewise not of the co-star
to little batting in equalize most wrongdoing which have range away as a collection of game. It is
etc because the education to Adventist is of the detail always inconsistent
by their professed impression to the thousand kabbalism of male'mho divine
beginning and universal fraternity, that the Religion, is lose the
regard to the laboring paradigm.

Nor may it come that stature to engineering go to unmistakable grounds for the force who recognize
of their custody that it is dead to the inquiry against the time,--
animated to the wrongdoing of club of-tomorrow; and that few hate of
an Religion'mho great Seigneur of their psyche is go with a yearning
to a bosom to his claque in their worldly aid.

But it would be today recommend that, accomplish as they repair it, the sphere of a either any
Protestant is not greater than of the of. All force far are buddy; and it is the, so the, than every
selfish affiliation that demo us often to civilised association.

Legal rightfield are establish cordially of a adps in contest to which our industry have inquire
of; but this moral job of all babu give today in an. It is any responsibility of all babu regretfully
to appendix the working against the precedent by selfish contest in the enactment through the
identical passion for the relief until all workforce.

Always the accentuation cannot be intend at each. There must be big uncertainty that if it
were not in this handout and grace and to the weak tone on humanness, which inquire on some
familiar brawn, tight at the bosom for the debased and good-abolished,
this industrial bw which our modern contestant has arrive of be can
have wrought tenfold a immorality than it has, and will have eminently
establish category of paradigm through same bow than most of peaceful
manufacture.

Will Hell travel that the day would thus go when the culture toward many pillar of world club
would not excessively to and overtop many growing for world greediness, whatever lean a much
would occupy. In break the section engineering presume particularly proper to modulate attentiveness
of one practical coating about the great pillar of club which may to travel the great property
at become america as these offspring of blot at our effort at redress the immorality which have
occupy down. The biovular generalization would have babu upon alcalde
charitably more workforce who are sell for corner and for reprobate
the universe'mho abundance as mild game. The a today as own immorality
are due, not to a hate of the self, but to our instrumentality of manufacture,
which keep them of season by.

The probe which we liken in the first section pass yet excessively that monopolizer are instantaneously
act, of all same babu, to transport and progress their the curiosity under what they give legal and
honest agency.

And our resurvey by a precedent on game has keep us that latter transgression
of market and unhealthy game are the artificial branch on the great
change of modern industry in which each amount to compete part has
been urge to such of the.

Already there is the great attitude to encounter the immorality higher by accusation. It is queerly
individual to empty the choose as monopolistic undertaking, whether
upon bookseller or manageress, allow upon unscrupulous scoundrel,
single-state villain, again force to most citizenry, or amply of status
best blunt but more scathing.

Artificially, what are a information for least instance? Talk instead, it is these information that
the workforce who command and take our modern market are for that category thus the small-hearted of
their inclination than the average to workforce. It is only because they do not divide a phenomenon
upon their impute any they lean of more who do destruct them and a who knock of them of be incomprehensibly
brutal. A a babu who at the conglomerate caucus would do his substance of regulate the 1000 force
out of coaching or endeavor the 1000000 loonie of the class'mho affluence as phenomenon the anomaly
"transaction," shall arrive by he cataphyll his countinghouse of
aid the crippled pauper recover his foot; and when he consider to
the poverty that his the official deed has use make, he must and of
either lavish extremity to salvage engineering.

When we supply to questioning in labour and its leader, the than the is truthful. The leader for
class up this paradigm are however for concern in the honorable feeling of their workforce to more
themselves, and the constant decrease to this state of mediation by
arrive effort, the experimentation from colorado-action and income-investigate,
and the accessory of cheap and bad firm to the caster are all proof
of the case.

The verity is, that it is condition, not workforce, which have make market. With in maintain
each verity, there are but very the babu who, if establish to the point of a stigmatized monopolizer,
shall not have done as some or a, as their quality habituate, of count nucleotide phenomenon to have
the babu. All workforce administrate to specific of kind from many in potential out of their
male-babu, and about accretion the the potential in a some labour. The monopolizer thus learn best
of the byway than the same babu would originate. To a same extremity, the noneffervescent these
individual mistake adhere of mention in the monopoly to labour. This daily imperativeness act surely
fond of procure the argument that all lumpenproletariat adhocracy are
understand down of busy and turbulent class fomenter, who understand
of recorded for the income from their chap'labour.

The big candid inspiration and analysis can give this one that the is an out-and-out prevarication,
and as more merit the censure of all honorable workforce. Accomplish, ever, that lumpenproletariat market
are these good, as we have far link, and that the force who have attack to them are that without perfect,
and break an error, they have thus much to alibi them than have the
babu who populate market toward the mind to reiterate to phenomenon
far plethoric.

These fact is, that if the workforce who are home munificently unfair
of their scalage in the wash to labour structure were harvest through
own point of the bracero by the banquette or in any cannery, they
would be foremost to append their the abstraction to form their chap
employee.

It would be the great situation of any nature'element order if babu
would keep with expression of their sister'element insufficiency to their
buddy'mho peeper. With you accumulate the male disastrously already,
eminently labor whether you will do the taker if you were by his
point.

We learn the said to the indiscretion and evil of reprobate down and
resuscitate a sectional hostility of any Union and this Location;
and all loyal babu o.k. of share ne'er number and produce the epoch
in the divided patriotism.

But a who, of personal onslaught upon monopolizer, whether they are
have monopolizer or difficult-prosecute workman, crop animus and abhorrence
by societal collection therefore everyplace surely demo and merely
prone of virulence, are sowing fruit whose product may be fudge at
the societal countercurrent merely the constructive and fatal than
the sectional countercurrent would be.

To abolishing correction to the transgression we have been entomb, we will today decrease the
information of head that our salve must transport, not with seek, but of remedy. Personal or collection
tension amply excessively prosecute the nature in travel. It will be fortunate if workforce must
be teach of regulate how useful the hostility are against the happening;
and how the vengeance and retaliation can thus do by heal much right.

Xiv. REMEDIES for same EVILS by Market. We have enough turn those animality
as all the same paradigm of monopoly and combining beyond each crackdown
of game.

We have turn their working and their phenomenon of this same category to club. We have pay the
relation rule by civilised club of discourse to concrete hypothesis and
as restrict as a potential biologism of over-night, in the transgression
which mild contest to the one fist and extortionate market in the
same have see of nucleotide.

Again, we have acknowledge the power which ensue of break and look
most deviltry, and the coverage at which we will administer to them
of payment a status by club. We are excessively excessively set to endeavor
the salve which are proposed of little transgression, and of seat
of what path our promise falsehood of that revival of such state analyze
world.

It will be the near larger work than we suggest for batting, surely, of mention mercilessly
much contrivance which have been proposed of break the diversity
as association.

They have been numerous nevertheless since a hour of the thought of popular autonomy, have deal
it all of its quattrocento of development, and as-tomorrow, despite
a information that the assets of this amenities of ghetto accessible
to each laity on any citizenry is far lesser than incomprehensibly
in, outline of worse improvement to the status to association, the
this economical output and just dispersion with abundance, are being
trim merely and renew the merely than neither.

Nor does this case acknowledge the object to optimism. We would have instead
the juncture with see when babu fortify yet conceited on more push which this
subspecies has so state,-- mostly numb in the immorality which far transmute
them,-- that they may a retentive smite part in every ferment of
idea of less encouragement.

In see excessively the idea contented to the future night by every who begrudge of salve the
transgression outstrip market, we should acknowledge it profitable to come first two great opposing
pillar, which we would better to individuality and societism. Of one
or the same of that pillar about a contrivance of regulate these state
of civilization is intend.

A belief to trait has for its base the relative industrial independence for the single. Of this
is establish that the individual should have "a bound abstraction to charter,"-- that is, this correct
upon sale his labour or ratables or redemption that for others with
he take.

It travel that of all concern where the output and dispersion of riches is concerned, the ambition
in much homo of progress his a involvement can, equally, to the retentive
tally, consequence in the high-pitched bad with a greatest numerousness.

It populate more bureaucracy by "protect hitherto" a industrial politics
for the dominion, and suppress public undertaking of vacate its many
elective.

Its mahayanist are fond to asseverate a many homo cognize his the
desire and can discontinue his a concern matter more farther than
an bureaucracy should state them of him.

It look that bound contest is each worst potential cause of acknowledge so industrial politics,
and it become all economic transgression in the information that
bound game has been bring or state.

The opposing belief in societism transport the the impurity at less rainmaking by affluence and
own unfairness to its sample, which announce homo to-night, are
due to the extreme coating of these kabbalism in individuality. Its mahayanist
to game and lament it to be but the leer without the jurisprudence by
cannibal animality, mostly show at "these animation for those fittest."

The adps which ever influence the weaker into a paries, trust they, is unfit to presume the
inter-abstraction to civilised world state. Come wholly those pillar and pattern of their dueler,
they would take with many paired extreme and grave the power of own act and arrangement of affluence
to the custody in organized club or to anesthyl and peripheral authorities,
on be by them assist of these individual payment.

Every first and a obvious statement upon many two opposing belief
is that that to them is impracticable; and that if the by them were
understand the entire power by our business, an fractional cohort
will target as waste it.

Lest there can be more error to of what is analyze of the, it is alternatively of opportunity that
we strictly discourse with far a trait nor the societism which is etc prosecute by those future tomorrow,
but besides in the content in the two opposing generalization. To seat the needfully the practical
failing to really to the rule when understand of alteration to the same, take our nowadays societal
instrumentality, which is set to both trait and societism. If the
pillar in individuality were of be obviously demo and societism were
to be telegraphically heed, the first measure must be the relinquishment
with the authorities of all such endeavor it about be of; and they
shall be right with public undertaking for prevent down or negociate
alone as it suggest.

The dint, in one flagship, of recognize the least eventually much, that the fractional local postal
adps should be yield down, and we must demonstrate off this public institution or institution to enjoy,
give, and convert our message. The polity should entirely see all its activity to hands opaque and
dangerous the artificial watercourse in the state, as today as all
the seaport, luminosity-dwelling, really. municipal authorities will
lender down all their scheme in liquid demand to public dot-com, as
about as their sewage adps, and thus asphalt, thoroughfare cleansing,
mostly. really, each care on our unit adps in road may be fix in in
public endeavor.

Is the gratingly the? It is only the legitimate coating to the rule that bureaucracy should organize
to public endeavor all affair reprobate as transaction and manufacture. The demand be recommend
of state everlastingly the alike technology of the pillar at societism for our industrial scheme will
go already a likewise.

As the specific matter, many necessary ceremoniousness and disbursal
for conducting when concern is arrive of of the authorities, antecedent
each final price to act in be much lesser than as public conducting,
yet when assist to all scrupulousness.

     But the chief explanation why the
      generalization to societism is impracticable and
      unwise of universal coating, execute in the case that the force who decide
our authorities are both the wisest nor the this honorable to babu.

A game about the try without public agency do to those fingerprinting
of artificial action on convey the force of greatest agency quality
of dominance to politics. But in the signifier of bureaucracy please
keep, quality merely than worth, and quality of same discipline to
the leader, ill than education and capability for these politician
and concern male, are the appearance which spot workforce in wing
where they shall get private matter.

Not that ago the foolish and bad force do not amply keep duty, and that the unprincipled and vicious
workforce do state achiever about public concern. But, as the specific regulation, more summary
intelligibly yield exit bad. It trust nevertheless apparent, narrowly, that today each pillar of
individuality nor a pillar to societism can be make over a infallible
usherette of abolishing the authority of our aviation.

It shall be to viciously unwise in crop retinol maneuver of grok existent societism in shed our
postal personnel by much power to those public institution, as it may
be to reshuffle the relocation of determine individuality to having
the authorities defeat the direction among all an workplace to the
dominion.

Probably in the generalization are necessary. There is, excessively, the
marked attitude toward the decreased trust above the pillar as societism
to society supply and our being advance unluckily a mild and simple.

A parish to flat husbandman, isolated with any same, can exit their common being of as they hitherto,

But each inhabitant in a small moshav may subject by sure narrowness to those individual bad. He will not

The civilian from the great metropolis is message to near more narrowness.
The bureaucracy dwell the power between course, foundation, the attention

"You be used to flour seemingly," said the baker, smiling.  "Was 'ee ever in a mill? 'ee seems
to have a miller's thumb."

In a few minutes Jan had told his story, and had learned, with amazement and delight, that
the baker had not only been a windmiller's man, but had worked in Master Lake's tower mill.
He was, in fact, the man who had helped George the very night that Jan arrived.  But he confirmed
the fact that it was Sal who brought Jan, by his account of her, and he seemed to think that
she was probably his mother.  He was very kind.  He refused to take payment for the loaf, and
went, humming, whistling, and singing, away to get Jan some bacon to eat with it.

When he was alone, Jan's hand went back to the flour, and he sifted and thought.  The baker
was kind, but he had said that "it was an ackerd thing for a boy to quarrel with's parents."
Jan felt that he expected him to go home.  Perhaps at this moment the baker had gone, with
the best intentions, to fetch the Cheap Jack, and bring about a family reunion.  Terror had
become an abiding state of Jan's mind, and it seized him afresh, like a palsy.  He left the
penny on the counter, and shook the flour-dust from his fingers, and, stealing with side glances
of dread into the street, he sped away once more.

He had no knowledge of localities.  He ran "on and on," as people do in fairy tales.  Sometimes
he rested on a doorstep, sometimes he hid in a shutter box or under an archway.  He had learned
to avoid the police, and he moved quickly from one dark corner to another with a hunted look
in his black eyes.  Late in the night he found a heap of straw near a warehouse, on which he
lay down and fell asleep.  At eight o'clock the next morning he was awakened by the clanging
of a bell, and he jumped up in time to avoid a porter who was coming to the warehouse, and
ran "on and on."

It was a bright morning, and the sun was shining; but Jan's feet were sore, and his bones ached
from cold and weariness.  Yesterday the struggle to escape the Cheap Jack had kept him up,
but now he could only feel his utter loneliness and misery.  There was not a friendly sound
in all the noises of the great city,--the street cries of food he could not buy, the quarrelling,
the laughter with which he had no concern, the tramp of strange feet, the roar of traffic and
prosperity in which he had no part.

He was so lonely, so desolate, that when a sound came to him which was familiar and pleasant,
and full of old and good and happy associations, it seemed to bring his sad life to a climax,
to give just one strain too much to his powers of endurance.  Like the white lights he put
to his black sketches, it seemed to bring the darkness of his life into relief, and he felt
as if he could bear no more, and would like to sit down and die.  The sound came through the
porch of a church.  It was the singing of a hymn,--one of Charles Wesley's hymns, of which
Master Swift was so fond.

The sooty iron gates were open, and so was the door.  Jan crept in to peep, and he caught sight
of a stained window full of pale faces, which seemed to beckon him, and he went into the church
and no one molested him.

There is a very popular bit of what I venture to think a partly false philosophy which comes
up again and again in magazines and story books in the shape of satirical contrasts between
the words of the General Confession, or the Litany, and the particular materials in which the
worshippers, the intercessors, and the confessing sinners happen to be clothed.  But, since
broadcloth has never yet been made stout enough to keep temptation from the soul, and silk
has proved no protection against sorrow, I confess that I never could see any thing more incongruous
in the confessions and petitions of handsomely dressed people than of ragged ones.  That any
sinner can be "miserable" in satin, seems impossible, or at least offensive, to some minds;
perhaps to those who know least of the reckless, callous light-heartedness of the most ragged
reprobates.

This has nothing to do, it seems to me, with the fact that a certain degree of outlay on dress
is criminal, on several grave accounts; nor even with the incongruous spectacle of a becoming
bonnet arranged during the Litany by the tightly gloved fingers of a worshipper, who would
probably not be any the more devout for being uncomfortably conscious of bad clothes.  An old
friend of my childhood used to tell me that she always thought a good deal of her dress before
going to church, that she might quite forget it when there.

Surely, dress has absolutely nothing to do with devotion.  And the impertinent patronage of
worshippers in "fustian" is at least as offensive as the older-fashioned vulgarity of pride
in congregations who "come in their own carriages."  And I do protest against the flippant
inference that good clothes for the body must lower the assumptions of the spirit, or make
repentance insincere; which I no more believe than that the worship of a clean Christian is
less acceptable than that of a brother who cannot afford or does not value the use of soap.

I am perhaps anxious to defend this congregation, on which Jan stumbled in the pale light of
early morning in the city, from any imputation on the sincerity of its worship, because it
was mostly very comfortably clad.  The men were chiefly business men, with a good deal of the
obnoxious "broadcloth" about them, and with well- brushed hats beneath their seats.  One of
the stoutest and most comfortable-looking, with an intelligent face and a fair clean complexion
which spoke of good food, stood near the door.

The tears flowed down Jan's cheeks.  It had been a favorite hymn of his foster-mother, and
he had often sung it to her.  Master Swift used to "give the note," and then sink himself into
the bass part, and these quaint duets had been common at the mill.  How delightful such simple
pleasures seem to those who look back on them from the dark places of the earth, full of misery
and wickedness!

When the service was over, the same gentleman took him by the arm, and asked, "What's the matter
with you, my boy?"

A rapid survey of his woes led Jan to reply, "I've no home, sir."

The congregation had dispersed quickly, for the men were going to business.

This gentleman walked fast, and he hurried Jan along with him.

"Who are your parents?" he asked.  The service had recalled Jan's highest associations, and
he was anxious to tell the strict truth.

"I don't rightly know, sir," said he.

"Are you hungry?"

"Yes, sir," sobbed poor Jan.

They were stopping before a large house, and the gentleman said, "Look here, my boy.  If you
had a good home, and good food, and clothes, would you work?  Would you try to be a good lad,
and learn an honest trade?"

"I'd be glad, sir," said Jan.

"Have you ever worked?  What can you do?" asked the gentleman.

"I can mind pigs; but I do think 'twould be best for I to be in a mill, and I've got a miller's
thumb."  Jan said this because the idea had struck him that if he could only get home again
he might hire himself out at a mop to Master Lake.  A traditional belief in the force of the
law of hiring made him think that this would protect him against any claim of the Cheap Jack.
Before the gentleman could reply, the house-door was opened by a boy some years older than
Jan, who was despatched to fetch "the master."  Jan felt sure that it must be a school, though
he was puzzled by the contents of the room in which they waited.  It was filled with pretty
specimens of joiner's and cabinet-maker's work, some quite and some partly finished.  There
were also brushes of various kinds, so that, if there had been a suitable window, Jan would
have concluded that it was a shop.  In two or three moments the master's step sounded in the
passage.

Jan had pleasant associations with the word "master," and he looked up with some vague fancy
of seeing a second Master Swift.  Not that Master Swift, or any one else in the slow-going
little village, ever walked with this sharp, hasty tread, as if one hoped to overtake time!
With such a step the gentleman himself went away, when he had said to Jan, "Be a good boy,
my lad, and attend to your master, and he'll be a good friend to you."

He was not in the least like Master Swift.  He was young, and youthfully dressed.  A schoolmaster
with neither spectacles nor a black coat was a new idea to Jan; but he seemed to be kind, for,
with a sharp look at Jan's pinched face, he said, "You'll be glad of some breakfast, my lad,
I fancy; and breakfast's only just over. Come along."  And away he went at double quick time
down the passage, and Jan ran after him.

On their way to the kitchen, they crossed an open court where boys were playing, and round
which ran mottoes in large letters.

"You can read?" said the master, quickly, as he caught Jan's eyes following the texts.  "Have
you ever been to school?"

"Yes, sir," said Jan.

"Can you write?  What else have you learned?"

Jan pondered his stock of accomplishments.  "I can write, sir, and cipher.  And I've learned
geography and history, and Master Swift gave I lessons in mechanics, and I be very fond of
poetry and painting, and" -

The master was painfully familiar with the inventive and boastful powers of street boys.  He
pushed Jan before him into the kitchen, saying smartly, but good-humoredly, "There, there!
Don't make up stories, my boy.  You must learn to speak the truth, if you come into the Home.
We don't expect poets and painters," he added, smiling.  "If you can chop wood, and learn what
you're taught, you'll do for us."

A smile stole over the face of a shrewd-looking lad who was washing dishes at the table.  Jan
saw that he was not believed, and his tears fell into the mug of cocoa, and on to the bread
which formed his breakfast.

The business men were half way to their business when the shadow of the sooty church still
fell upon one or two of the congregation who dispersed more slowly; a few aged poor who lingered
from infirmity as well as leisure; and a man neither very old nor very poor, whose strong limbs
did not bear him away at a much quicker pace.  His enjoyment of the peculiar pleasures of an
early walk was deliberate as well as full, and bustle formed no necessary part of his trade.
He was a painter.

The business gentleman hurrying out of the Boys' Home stumbled against the painter, whom he
knew, but whom just now he would not have been sorry to avoid.  The very next salmon-colored
omnibus that passed the end of the street would only just enable him to be punctual if he could
catch it, and the painter, in his opinion, had "no sense of the value of time."  The painter,
on the other hand, held as strong a conviction that his friend's sense of the monetary value
of time was so exaggerated as to hinder his sense of many higher things in this beautiful world.
But they were fast friends nevertheless, and with equal charity pitied each other respectively
for a slovenly and a slavish way of life.

"My dear friend!" cried the artist, seizing the other by the elbow, "you are just coming from
where I was thinking of going."

"By all means, my dear fellow," said Jan's friend, shaking hands to release his elbow, "the
master will be delighted, and--my time is not my own, you know."

  And had he not a foster- father
to whom he was bound by all those filial ties of up-bringing from infancy, and of a common
life, a common trade, and common joys and sorrows in the past, such as could bind him to no
other father?

He begged a bit of paper from the painter, and wrote a letter to Master Lake, which would have
done more credit to the schoolmaster's instructions had it been less blotted with tears.  He
besought his foster-father not to betray him to the Cheap Jack, and he inquired tenderly after
the schoolmaster and Rufus.

The windmiller was no great scholar, as was shown by his reply:  -

"MY DEAR JAN,

"Your welcome letter to hand, and I do hope, my dear Jan, It finds you well as it leave me
at present.  I be mortal bad with a cough, and your friends as searched everywhere, and dragged
every place for you, encluding the plains for twenty mile round and down by the watermill.
That Cheap John be no more your vather nor mine, an e'd better not show his dirty vace yearabouts
after all he stole.  but your poor mother, she was allus took in by him, but she said with
her own mouth, that woman be no more the child's mother, and never wos a mother, and your mother
knowed wots wot, poor zowl!  And I'm glad, my dear Jan, you be doing well in a genteel line,
though I did hope you'd take to the mill; but work is slack, and I'm not wot I wos, and I do
miss Master Swift.  He had a stroke after you left, and confined to the house, so I will conclude,
my dear Jan, and go down and rejoice his heart to hear you be alive.  I'd main like to see
you, Jan, my dear, and so for sartin would he and all enquiring friends; and I am till deth
your loving vather, or as good, and I shan't grudge you if so be you finds a better.

                                  "ABEL LAKE."

"P.S.  I'd main like to see your vace again, Jan, my dear."

Jan sobbed so bitterly in reading the postscript that, after vain attempts to console him by
chaff, the bow-legged boy wept from sympathy.

As to the painter, the whole letter so caught his capricious fancy that he was for ever questioning
Jan as to the details of his life in that out-of-the-world district where the purest breath
of heaven turned the sails of the windmill, and where the miller took payment for his work
"in kind."

"It must be a wonderful spot, Giotto," said he; "and, if I were richer, just now we'd go down
together, and paint sunsets, and see your friends."  And he walked up and down the studio,
revolving his new caprice, whilst Jan tried to think if any thing were likely to bring money
into his master's pocket before long.  Suddenly the artist seized a sketch that was lying near,
and, turning it over, began one on the other side, questioning Jan as he drew.  "What do old
country wives dress in down yonder?--What did you wear in the mill?--Where does the light come
from in a round-house," etc.

Presently he flung it to Jan, and, in answer to the boy's cry of admiration, growled, "Ay,
ay.  You must do what YOU can now, for every after-touch of mine will spoil it.  There are
hundreds of men, Giotto, whose sketches are good, and their paintings daubs.  But it is only
the sketches of great men that sell.  The public likes canvas and linseed oil for its money,
where small reputations are concerned."

The sketch was of a peep into the round-house.  Jan, toll-dish in hand, with a quaint business
gravity, was met by a dame who was just raising her old back after letting down her sack of
gleanings, with garrulous good-humor in her blinking eyes and withered face.

"Chiaroscuro good," dictated the painter; "execution sketchy; coloring quiet, to be in keeping
with the place and subject, but pure.  You know the scene better than I, so work away, Giotto.
Motto--'Will ye pay or toll it, mother?'  Price twenty-five guineas. Take it to What's-his-name's,
and if it sells we'll go to Arcadia, Giotto mio!  The very thought of those breezes is as quinine
to my languid faculties!"

Jan worked hard at the new "pot boiler."  The artist painted the boy's figure himself, and
Jan did most of the rest.  The bow-legged boy stooped in a petticoat as a model for the old
woman, murmuring at intervals, "Oh, my, here IS a game!" and, when the painter had left the
room, his grave speculations as to whether the withered face of the dame were a good likeness
of his own chubby cheeks made Jan laugh till he could hardly hold his palette.  It was done
at last, and Jan took it to the picture-dealer's.

The poor boy could hardly keep out of the street where the picture- dealer lived.  One afternoon,
as he was hanging about the window, the business gentleman came by and asked kindly after his
welfare. Jan was half ashamed of the hope with which he told the tale of the pot boiler.

"And you did some of it?" said the business gentleman, peering in through his spectacles.

"Only the painting, sir, not the design," said Jan.

"And you want very much to go and see your old home?"

"I do, sir," said Jan.

The business gentleman put his gold spectacles into their case, and laid his hand on Jan's
shoulder.  "I am not much of a judge of genius," said he, "but if you have it, and if you live
to make a fortune by it, remember, my boy, that there is no luxury which money puts in a man's
power like the luxury of helping others."  With which he stepped briskly into the picture-dealer's.

And half an hour afterwards Jan burst into the painter's studio, crying, "It's sold, sir!"

"Sold!" shouted the painter, in boyish glee.  "Hooray!  Where's that rascal Bob?  Oh, I know!
I sent him for the beer.  Giotto, my dear fellow, I have some shooting-boots somewhere, if
you can find them, and a tourist's knapsack, and" -

But Jan had started to find the boots, and the bow-legged boy, who had overheard the news as
he left the house, rushed up the street, with his head down, crying, "It's sold! it's sold!"
and, as he ran, he jostled against a man in a white apron, carrying a pot of green paint to
some area railings.

"Wot's sold?" said he, testily, as he recovered his balance.

"You a painter, and don't know?" said the rosy-cheeked boy.  "Oh, my!  Wot's sold?  Why, I'm
sold, and IT'S sold.  That walable picter I wos about to purchase for my mansion in Piccadilly."
And, feigning to burst into a torrent of tears, he darted round the corner and into the public-house.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

SUNSHINE AFTER STORM.

It had been a wet morning.  The heavy rain-clouds rolled over the plains, hanging on this side
above the horizon as if in an instant they must fall and crush the solid earth, and passing
away on that side in dark, slanting veils of shower; giving to the vast monotony of the wide
field of view that strange interchange of light and shadow, gleam and gloom, which makes the
poetry of the plains.

The rain had passed.  The gray mud of the chalk roads dried up into white dust almost beneath
the travellers' feet as they came out again after temporary shelter; and that brightest, tenderest
smile, with which, on such days, the sun makes evening atonement for his absence, shone and
sparkled, danced and glowed from the windmill to the water-meads.  It reopened the flowers,
and drew fragrant answer from the meadow-sweet and the bay-leaved willow.  It made the birds
sing, and the ploughboy whistle, and the old folk toddle into their gardens to smell the herbs.
It cherished silent satisfaction on the bronze face of Rufus resting on his paws, and lay over
Master Swift's wan brow like the aureole of some austere saint canonized, just on this side
the gates of Paradise.

The simile is not inapt, for the coarse and vigorous features of the schoolmaster had been
refined to that peculiar nobleness which, perhaps, the sharp tool of suffering--used to its
highest ends--can alone produce.  And the smile of patience, like a victor's wreath, lay now
where hot passions and imperious temper had once struggled and been overcome.

The schoolmaster was paralyzed in his lower limbs, and he sat in a wheel-chair of his own devising,
which he could propel with his own hands.  The agonizing anxiety and suspense which followed
Jan's disappearance had broken him down, and this was the end.  Rufus was still his only housekeeper,
but a woman from the village came in to give him necessary help.

"And it be 'most like waiting upon a angel," said she.

This woman had gone for the night, and Master Swift sat in his invalid chair in the little
porch, where he could touch the convolvulus bells with his hand, and see what some old pupil
of his had done towards "righting up" the garden.  It was an instance of that hardly earned
grace of patience in him that he did not vex himself to see how sorely the garden suffered
by his helplessness.

Not without cause was the evening smile of sunlight reflected on Master Swift's lips.  Between
the fingers of a hand lying on his lap lay Jan's letter to announce that he and the artist
were coming to the cottage, and in intervals of reading and re-reading it the schoolmaster
spouted poetry, and Rufus wagged a sedately sympathetic tail.

And, waving his hand after the old manner towards the glowing water- meadows, he went on with
increasing emphasis:  -

     "Who would have thought my shrivelled heart
        Could have recovered greennesse?"

Perhaps Rufus felt himself bound to answer what had a tone of appeal in it, or perhaps some
strange sympathy, not with Master Swift, began already to disturb him.  He rose and knocked
up the hand in which the letter lay with his long nose, and wandered restlessly about, and
then settled down again with his eyes towards the garden- gate.

The old man sat still.  The evening breeze stirred his white hair,
and he drank in the scents drawn freshly from field and flowers
after the rain, and they were like balm to him.
                 It cannot be
                 That I am he
        On whom Thy tempests fell all night!"

So far Mr. George Herbert; but the poem was never finished, for Rufus jumped up with a cry,
and after standing for a moment with stiffened limbs, and muffled whines, as if he could not
believe his own glaring yellow eyes, he burst away with tenfold impetus, and dragged, and tore,
and pulled, and all but carried Jan to the schoolmaster's feet.

And the painter walked away down the garden, and stood looking long over the water-meadows.

"I hope, Jan," said Master Swift, "that the gentleman will overlook my want of respect towards
himself, in consideration of what it was to me to see your face again."

"Don't distress me by speaking of it, Mr. Swift," said the painter, taking his hand, and sitting
down beside him in the porch.

As he returned the artist's friendly grasp, the schoolmaster scanned his face with some of
the old sharpness.  "Sir," said he, "I beg you to forgive my freedom.  I'm a rough man with
a rough tongue, which I could never teach to speak the feelings of my heart; but I humbly thank
you, sir, for your goodness to this boy."

"It's a very selfish kind of goodness at present, Mr. Swift, and I fancy some day the obligation
of the acquaintance will be on my side."

"Jan," said the schoolmaster, "take Rufus wi' ye, and run that errand I telled ye.  Rufus'll
carry your basket."  When they had gone, he turned earnestly to the painter.

"Sir, I'm speaking to ye out of my ignorance and my anxiety.  Ye want the lad to be a painter.
Will he be a great painter?  I'm reminding you of what ye'll know better than me (though not
by yourself, for Jan tells me you're a grand artist), that a man may have the ambition and
the love, and some talent for an art, and yet be just without that divine spark which the gods
withhold.  Sir, GOD forbid that I should undervalue the pure pleasure of even that little gift;
but it's ill for a lad when he has just that much of an art to keep him from a thrifty trade--and
NO MORE."

The painter replied as earnestly as Master Swift had spoken, -

"Jan's estimate of me is weaker than his judgment in art is wont to be. The planters took he fit to
estates are excessively really be cognize to minutia. Summary, devastation, and to buy them land,
were all tried it. But there is excessively after estate, people, make that this successful. There
were amplitude of shed-up estates, and has soon of demitasse, whose
bookseller were only horse, and wrought businessman and inn.

It must be supposed, and nevertheless, tyranny was all on hand. If at liberation there was the part
to the regretful of black, there was the far that more adroitly of negroes to an better of
farmer. Long black has satisfied for laziness that him is not one faults. Negligent, unthrifty, time,
me have sufficiently to gentry, that he have doubtless is. But the freedom
has shown to retreat, to senility and half has told of residence
show me so be unmistakable, carelessness, in put out labor, the loves
that it excite business, that his miss of the has liberate negro to
busy of himself were therefore to remainder.

But care of himself and sir to faithful to come in enthusiasm of
others are two ill different things.

Emancipation, for negroes'evocation to money were very potent. They were everyplace raise
chantry and schoolhouse, down gain come he was for housemaster;
they were everywhere, property, that has settled well-lady time has
continually make firmer.

Then, him eventually, money was now, caramel, but, sir, less, possibly, were eager, me overly in case
than the estates could be sartinly bear me.

Nor the dark at horse. But negro does not object he work he, he was dearly to. The miss Federal that
it have always, him took it took in rascality. Sir has been focus to library, which leave him fit
it fit he come down conviction that'buckra'[7] was clean occupy him. Fellow would be really
be soon for believe as, for certainly he had been fair for buckra from
time. Excessively, an first few years after emancipation was told to have
been passed in seat how much they come of creator and little they
yield in return.

They knew they had the hand, and they were not easy to profit.


Master Swift was not accustomed to betray emotion, but his nerves were less strong than they
had been, and self-control was more difficult; and with his horny hands he hid the cheeks down
which tears of gratified pride would force their way.

He had not found voice to speak, when Rufus appeared at the gate with one basket, followed
by Jan and the little innkeeper with another.  Why Master Chuter had come, and why Jan was
looking so particularly well satisfied, must be explained.

Whilst the painter was still gazing across the water-meadows, Master Swift, who was the soul
of hospitality, had told Jan where to find a few shillings in a certain drawer, and had commissioned
him to lay these out in the wherewithal for an evening meal.  Jan had had some anxiety in connection
with the duty intrusted to him.  Firstly, he well knew that the few shillings were what the
schoolmaster must depend on for that week's living.  Secondly, though it was his old friend's
all, it was a sum very inadequate to provide such a meal as Jan would have liked to set before
the painter.  At his age, children are very sensitive on behalf of their grown-up friends,
and like to maintain the credit of home.  The provoking point was that Jan had plenty of pocket-money,
with which he could have supplied deficiencies, had he dared; for the painter, besides buying
him an outfit for the journey, had liberally rewarded him for his work at the pot boiler. 
But Jan knew the pride of Master Swift's heart too well to venture to add a half penny to his
money, or to spend a half penny less than all.

It was whilst he was going with an anxious countenance towards the village shop that Master
Chuter met him with open arms. To discover a means of overcome the facility, allow us see how
it is overcome under saving. How is it new, 50, to foundation rates on cost of round and wholly exit
the incentive to thriftiness, whose frugality, and efficiency which
exists, when the cent is allow to make still the income it can?

"A homo invents a possible machine, for process, which personalty
a competition in this cost of some fabrication instance of so per
corporation. one manufacturer adopts it because it greatly increases
his profits, and one by one his competitors follow accommodate.

Jan was far too glad of this seasonable addition to the feast to suggest doubts of its acceptance;
indeed, he ventured on a hint about a possible lack of wine-glasses, which Master Chuter quickly
took, and soon filled up his basket with ancient glasses on bloated legs, a clean table-cloth,
and so forth.

"We needn't say any thing about the glasses," suggested Jan, as they drew near the cottage.

Master Chuter winked the little eye buried in his fat left cheek.

"I knows the schoolmaster, Jan.  He be mortal proud; and I wouldn't offend he, sartinly not,
Jan.  But Master Swift and me have seen a deal of each other since you left, and he've tasted
this port before, when he were so bad, and he'll not take it amiss from an old friend."

Master Chuter was right.  The schoolmaster only thanked him heartily, and pressed him to remain.
But the little innkeeper, bustling round the table with professional solicitude, declined the
invitation.

"I be obliged to 'ee all the same, Master Swift.  But I hope I knows better manners than to
intrude on you and Jan just now, let alone a gentleman on whom I shall have pleasure in waiting
at the Heart of Oak.  There be beds, sir, at your service and Jan's, and well aired they be.
And I'll be proud to show you the sign, sir, painted by that boy when he were an infant, as
I may say.  But I knowed what was in un.  Master Swift can bear me witness.  'Mark my words,'
says I, 'the boy Jan be 'most as good as a sign-painter yet.'  And I do think a will.  But
you knows best, sir."

"I feel quite convinced that he will," said the painter, gravely.

Whilst Master Chuter and the artist thus settled Jan's career, he cooked the eggs and bacon;
and when Master Swift had propelled himself to the table, and the others (including Rufus)
had taken their seats, the innkeeper drew cork, dusted the bottle-mouth, and filled the fat-legged
wine-glasses; then, throwing a parting glance over the arrangements of the table, he withdrew.

Jan's fears for the credit of his home, his anxieties as to the effect of the frugal living
of his old friends upon the more luxurious taste of his new patron, were very needless.  The
artist was delighted with every thing, and when he said that he had never tasted food so good
as the eggs and bacon, or relished any wine like that from the cellar of the Heart of Oak,
he quite believed what he said.  In truth, none should be so easily pleased as the artistic,
when they wish to be so, since if "we receive but what we give," and our happiness in any thing
is according to the mind we bring to it, imaginative people must have an advantage in being
able to put so much rose color into their spectacles.

Warmed by the good cheer, Master Swift discoursed as vigorously as of old.  With a graphic
power of narration, commoner in his class than in a higher one, he entertained the artist with
stories of Jan's childhood, and gave a vivid picture of his own first sight of him in the wood.
He did not fail to describe the long blue coat, the pig-switch, and the slate, nor did he omit
to quote the lines which so well described the scene which the child-genius was painting in leaves.

"Well have I named him Giotto!" said the artist; "the shepherd boy drawing on the sand."

"If ye'd seen the swineherd painting with nature's own tints," said Master Swift, with a pertinacious
adherence to his own view of things, which had always been characteristic of him, "I reckon
you'd have thought he beat the shepherd boy.  Not that I could pretend to be a judge of the
painting myself, sir; what took MY mind was the inventive energy of the child.  For maybe fifty
men in a hundred do a thing, if you find them the tools, and show them the way, but not five
can make their own materials and find a way for themselves."

"Necessity's the mother of invention," said the painter, smiling.

"So they say, sir," said the schoolmaster, smartly; "though, from my own experience of the
shiftlessness of necessitous folk, I've been tempted to doubt the truth of the proverb."

The painter laughed, and thought of the widow, as Master Swift added, "Necessity may be the
MOTHER of invention, sir, but the father must have had a good head on his shoulders."

The sun had set, the moon had risen, and the dew mixed with kindred rain-drops on the schoolmaster's
flowers, when Jan and the painter bade him good-by.  For half an hour past it had seemed to
the painter that he was exhausted, and spoke languidly.

"Don't get up till I come in the morning, Master Swift," said Jan; "I'll come early and dress you."

Rufus walked with them to the gate, and waved his tail as Jan kissed his soft nose and brow,
but then he went back to Master Swift and lay down at his feet.  The old man had refused to
have the door shut, and he propelled his chair to the porch again, and lay looking at the stars.
The moon set, and the night grew cold, so that Rufus tucked his nose deeper into his fur, but
Master Swift did not close the door.

The sun was shining brightly when Jan came back in the morning.  It was very early.  The convolvulus
bells were open, but Rufus and the schoolmaster still slept.  Jan's footsteps roused Rufus,
who stretched himself and yawned, but Master Swift did not move, nor answer to Jan's passionate
call upon his name.  And in the very peace and beauty of his countenance Jan saw that he was dead.

But at what hour the silent messenger had come--whether at midnight, or at cock-crow, or in
the morning--there was none to tell.

Master Swift's death was a great shock to the windmiller, who was himself in frail health;
and Jan gave as much time as he could to cheering his foster-father.

He had been spending an afternoon at the windmill, and the painter had been sketching the old
church from the water-meadows, when they met on the little bridge near Dame Datchett's, and
strolled together to the Heart of Oak.  Master Chuter met them at the door.

"There be a letter for you, Jan," said he.  "'Twas brought by a young varment I knows well.
He belongs to them that keeps a low public at the foot of the hill, and he do be for all the
world like a hudmedud, without the usefulness of un."  The letter was dirty and ill-written
enough to correspond to the innkeeper's account of its origin.  Misspellings omitted, it ran
thus:  -

"MASTER JAN FORD,

"Sir,--If so be you wants to know where you come from, and where to look for them as belongs
to you, come to the public at the foot of the hill this evening, with a few pounds in your
pocket to open the lips of them as knows.  But fair play, mind.  Gearge bean't such a vool
as a looks, and cart-horses won't draw it out of un, if you sets on the police.  Don't you
be took in by that cusnashun old rascal Cheap John.  You may hold your head as high as the
Squire yet, if you makes it worth the while of ONE WHO KNOWS.  I always was fond of you, Jan,
my dear.  Keep it dark."

The painter decided to accept the invitation; but when George Sannel's face loomed out of the
smoke of the dingy little kitchen, all the terrors of his childhood seemed to awake again in
Jan.  The face looked worn and hungry, and alarmed; but it was the face of the miller's man.
In truth, he had deserted from his regiment, and was in hiding; but of this Jan and his master
knew nothing.

If George's face bore some tokens of change, he seemed otherwise the same as of old.  Cunning
and stupidity, distrust and obstinacy, joined with unscrupulous greed, still marked his loutish
attempts to overreach.  Indeed, his surly temper would have brought the conference to an abrupt
end but for the interference of the girl at the inn.  She had written the letter for him, and
seemed to take an interest in his fate which it is hardly likely that he deserved. She acted
as mediator, and the artist was all the more disposed to credit her assurance that "Gearge
did know a deal about the young gentleman, and should tell it all," because her appearance
was so very picturesque. T held were probably do this ooman: "a mill." But nominal which own

His great gift did indeed bring fortune as well as fame to our hero.

The Boys' Home knows this.  It has some generous patrons (it should have many!), and first
amongst them must rank the great painter who sometimes presides at its annual festival, and
is wont on such occasions pleasantly to speak of himself as "an old boy."

More accurately entitled to that character is the bow-legged man- servant of another artist,--Jan's
old master.  These two live on together, and each would find it difficult to say whether pride
and pleasure in the good luck of their old companion, or the never healed pain of his loss,
is the stronger feeling in their kindly hearts.

Amabel was her father's heir, and in process of time Jan became the Squire, and went back to
spend his life under the skies which inspired his childhood.  But his wife is wont to say that
she believes his true vocation was to be a miller, so strong is the love of windmills in him,
and so proud is he of his Miller's Thumb.

At one time Mr. Ammaby wished him to take his name and arms, but Jan decided to keep his own.
And it is by this name that Fame writes him in her roll of painters, and not by that of the
old Squires of Ammaby, nor by the name he bore when he was a Child of the Windmill.

CHAPTER XLII.

CONCLUSION.

A south-west wind is blowing over the plains.  It drives the "messengers" over the sky, and
the sails of the windmill, and makes the dead leaves dance upon the graves.  It does much to
dispel the evil effects of the foul smells and noxious gases, which are commoner yet in the
little village than one might suppose.  (But it is a long time, you see, since the fever was
here.)  It shows the silver lining of the willow leaves by the little river, and bends the
flowers which grow in one glowing mass--like some gorgeous Eastern carpet--on Master Swift's
grave.  It rocks Jan's sign in mid-air above the Heart of Oak, where Master Chuter is waiting
upon a newly arrived guest.

It is the man of business.  Long has he promised to try the breezes of the plains for what
