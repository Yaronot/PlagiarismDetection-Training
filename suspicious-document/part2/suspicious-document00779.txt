The Babylonian Story of the Deluge as Told by Assyrian Tablets from Nineveh.

By E. A. Wallis Budge.

The Discovery of the Tablets at Nineveh by Layard, Rassam and Smith.

In 1845-47 and again in 1849-51 Mr. (later Sir) A. H. Layard carried out a series of excavations
among the ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh, "that great city, wherein are more than sixteen
thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left; and also much
cattle" (Jonah iv, II). Its ruins lie on the left or east bank of the Tigris, exactly opposite
the town of Al-Mawsil, or Môsul, which was founded by the Sassanians and marks the site of
Western Nineveh. At first Layard thought that these ruins were not those of Nineveh, which
he placed at Nimrûd, about 20 miles downstream, but of one of the other cities that were builded
by Asshur (see Gen. x, 11, 12). Thanks, however, to Christian, Roman and Muhammadan tradition,
there is no room for doubt about it, and the site of Nineveh has always been known. He, it know; and

The mass of tablets which had been discovered by Layard and Rassam at Nineveh came to the British
Museum in 1854-5, and their examination by Rawlinson and Norris began very soon after. Mr.
Bowler, a skilful draughtsman and copyist of tablets, whom Rawlinson employed in making transfers
of copies of cuneiform texts for publication by lithography, rejoined a considerable number
of fragments of bilingual lists, syllabaries, etc., which were published in the second volume
of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, in 1866. In that year the Trustees of the British
Museum employed George Smith to assist Rawlinson in sorting, classifying and rejoining fragments,
and a comprehensive examination of the collection by him began. His personal interest in Assyriology
was centred upon historical texts, especially those which threw any light on the Bible Narrative.
But in the course of his search for stories of the campaigns of Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon
and Ashur-bani-pal, he discovered among other important documents (1) a series of portions
of tablets which give the adventures of Gilgamish, an ancient king of Erech; (2) An account
of the Deluge, which is supplied by the Eleventh Tablet of the Legend of Gilgamish (in more
than one version); (3) A detailed description of the Creation; (4) the Legend of the Descent
of Ishtar into Hades in quest of Tammuz. The general meaning of the texts was quite clear,
but there were many gaps in them, and it was not until December, 1872, that George Smith published
his description of the Legend of Gilgamish, and a translation of the "Chaldean Account of the
Deluge." The interest which his paper evoked was universal, and the proprietors of the "Daily
Telegraph" advocated that Smith should be at once dispatched to Nineveh to search for the missing
fragments of tablets which would fill up the gaps in his texts, and generously offered to contribute
1,000 guineas towards the cost of the excavations. The Trustees accepted the offer and gave
six months' leave of absence to Smith, who left London in January, and arrived in Môsul in
March, 1873. In the following May he recovered from Kuyûnjik a fragment that contained "the
greater portion of seventeen lines of inscription belonging to the first column of the Chaldean
account of the Deluge, and fitting into the only place where there was a serious blank in the
story." [6] During the excavations which Smith carried out at Kuyûnjik in 1873 and 1874 he
recovered many fragments of tablets, the texts of which enabled him to complete his description
of the contents of the Twelve Tablets of the Legend of Gilgamish which included his translation
of the story of the Deluge. Unfortunately Smith died of hunger and sickness near Aleppo in
1876, and he was unable to revise his early work, and to supplement it with the information
which he had acquired during his latest travels in Assyria and Babylonia. Thanks to the excavations
which were carried on at Kuyûnjik by the Trustees of the British Museum after his untimely
death, several hundreds of tablets and fragments have been recovered, and many of these have
been rejoined to the tablets of the older collection. By the careful study and investigation
of the old and new material Assyriologists have, during the last forty years, been enabled
to restore and complete many passages in the Legends of Gilgamish and the Flood. It is now
clear that the Legend of the Flood had not originally any connection with the Legend of Gilgamish,
and that it was introduced into it by a late editor or redactor of the Legend, probably in
order to complete the number of the Twelve Tablets on which it was written in the time of Ashur-bani-pal.

 The Babylonian versions state that this inundation
or flood was caused by rain, but passages in some of them suggest that the effects of the rainstorm
were intensified by other physical happenings connected with the earth, of a most destructive
character. The Hebrews also, as we may see from the Bible, had alternative views as to the
cause of the Deluge. According to one, rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights
(Gen. vii, 12), and according to the other the Deluge came because "all the fountains of the
"great deep" were broken up, and "the flood-gates of heaven were opened" (Gen. vii, 11). The
latter view suggests that the rain flood was joined by the waters of the sea. Later tradition,
based partly on Babylonian and partly on Hebrew sources, asserts in the "Cave of Treasures"
[9] that when Noah had entered the Ark and the door was shut, "the sluices of heaven were opened,
and the deeps were rent asunder," and "that the Ocean, that great sea that surroundeth the
whole world, vomited its waters, and the sluices of heaven being opened, and the deeps of the
earth being rent asunder, the storehouses of the winds were opened, and the whirlwinds broke
loose, and the Ocean roared and poured out its waters in floods." The ark was steered over
the waters by an angel who acted as pilot, and when that had come to rest on the mountains
of Kardô (Armenia) "God commanded the waters and they separated from each other. The waters
that had been above ascended to their place above the heavens, whence they had come; and the
waters that had come up from under the earth returned to the lower deep; and the waters that
were from the Ocean returned into it" (Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 25,875, fol. 17b, col. 1
and fol. 18a, cols. 1 and 2). Many authorities seeking to find a foundation of fact for the
Legend of the Deluge in Mesopotamia have assumed that the rain flood was accompanied either
by an earthquake or a tidal wave, or by both. There is no doubt that the cities of Lower Babylonia
were nearer the sea in the Sumerian Period than they are at the present time, and it is a generally
accepted view that the head of the Persian Gulf lay further to the north at that time. A cyclone
coupled with a tidal wave is a sufficient base for any of the forms of the Legend now known.

A comparison of the contents of the various Sumerian and Babylonian versions of the Deluge
that have come down to us shows us that they are incomplete. And as none of them tells so connected
and full a narrative of the prehistoric shipbuilder as Berosus, a priest of Bêl, the great
god of Babylon, it seems that the Mesopotamian scribes were content to copy the Legend in an
abbreviated form. Berosus, it is true, is not a very ancient authority, for he was not born
until the reign of Alexander the Great, but he was a learned man and was well acquainted with
the Babylonian language, and with the ancient literature of his country, and he wrote a history
of Babylonia, some fragments of which have been preserved to us in the works of Alexander Polyhistor,
Eusebius, and others. The following is a version of the fragment which describes the flood
that took place in the days of Xisuthrus, the tenth King of the Chaldeans, and is of importance
for comparison with the rendering of the Legend of the Deluge, as found on the Ninevite tablets,
which follows immediately after.

The Legend of the Deluge According to Berosus. They, who remained within, finding that their
companions did not return, quitted the vessel with many lamentations, and called continually
on the name of Xisuthrus. To this he added that they should return to Babylonia; and, it was
ordained, search for the writings at Sippara, which they were to make known to mankind: moreover
that the place, wherein they then were, was the land of Armenia. The rest having heard these
words, offered sacrifices to the gods; and taking a circuit journeyed towards Babylonia." (Cory,
Ancient Fragments, London, 1832, p. 26ff.)

The Babylonian Legend of the Deluge as Told to the Hero Gilgamish by His Ancestor Uta-Napishtim,
Who Had Been Made Immortal by the Gods.

The form of the Legend of the Deluge given below is that which is found on the Eleventh of
the Series of Twelve Tablets in the Library of Nebo at Nineveh, which described the life and
exploits of Gilgamish (), an early king of the city of Erech. As we have seen above, the Legend
of the Deluge has in reality no connection with the Epic of Gilgamish, but was introduced into
it by the editors of the Epic at a comparatively late period, perhaps even during the reign
of Ashur-bani-pal (B.C. 668-626). They so, as past, and we must here say human quality to yet; we must

 And at present Gilgamish is thy bosom friend. He maketh thee to lie down on a large
couch, and to sleep in a good, well-decked bed, and to occupy the chair of peace, the chair
on the left-hand side. The princes of the earth kiss thy feet. He maketh the people of Erech
to sigh for thee, and many folk to cry out for thee, and to serve thee. And for thy sake he
putteth on coarse attire and arrayeth himself in the skin of the lion, and pursueth thee over
the plain." When Enkidu heard these words his anxious heart had peace.

To the Third Tablet probably belongs the fragment in which Enkidu relates to Gilgamish a horrifying
dream which he had had. In his dream it seemed to him that there were thunderings in heaven
and quaking upon earth, and a being with an awful visage, and nails like all eagle's talons,
gripped him and carried him off and forced him to go down into the dark abyss of the dread
goddess, Irkalla. From this abode he who once "went in never came out, and he who travelled
along that road never returned, he who dwelleth there is without light, the beings therein
eat dust and feed upon mud; they are clad in feathers and have wings like birds, they see no
light, and they live in the darkness of night." "half falsehood, or the bearing who set of Incubus,"

In answer to Ishtar's invitation Gilgamish makes a long speech, in which he reviews the calamities
and misfortunes of those who have been unfortunate enough to become the lovers of the goddess.
Her love is like a door that lets in wind and storm, a fortress that destroys the warriors
inside it, an elephant that smashes his howdah, etc. He says, "What lover didst thou love for
long? Which of thy shepherds flourished? Come now, I will describe the calamity [that goeth
with thee]." He refers to Tammuz, the lover of her youth, for whom year by year she arranges
wailing commemorations. Every creature that falls under her sway suffers mutilation or death,
the bird's wings are broken, the lion is destroyed, the horse is driven to death with whip
and spur; and his speech concludes with the words: "Dost thou love me, and wouldst thou treat
me as thou didst them?"

When Ishtar heard these words she was filled with rage, and she went up to heaven and complained
to Anu, her father, and Antu, her mother, that Gilgamish had cursed her and revealed all her
iniquitous deeds and actions. She followed up her complaint with the request that Anu should
create a mighty bull of heaven to destroy Gilgamish, and she threatened her father that if
he did not grant her request she would do works of destruction, presumably in the world. Anu
created the fire-breathing (?) bull of heaven and sent him to the city of Erech, where he destroyed
large numbers of the people. At length Enkidu and Gilgamish determined to go forth and slay
the bull. When they came to the place where he was, Enkidu seized him by the tail, and Gilgamish
delivered deadly blows between his neck and his horns, and together they killed, him. As soon
as Ishtar heard of the death of the bull she rushed out on the battlements of the walls of
Erech and cursed Gilgamish for destroying her bull. The earliest mischief there would be so hath

[17] The greater number of these have been collected, grouped and published by Haupt, Das Babylonische
Nimrodepos, Leipzig, 1884 and 1891; and see his work on the Twelfth Tablet in Beiträge zur
Assyriologie, Vol. I, p. 49ff.

[19] The city of Erech was the second of the four cities which, according to Genesis x, 10,
were founded by Nimrod, the son of Cush, the "mighty hunter before the Lord. The Sumerians
and Babylonians called the city "Uruk Ki" ; the first sign means "dwelling" or "habitation,"
and the second "land, country," etc., and we may regard it as the "inhabited country," par
excellence, of Lower Babylonia at a very early period. The site of Erech is well-known, and
is marked by the vast ruins which the Arabs call "Warkah," or Al-Warkah. These lie in 31º 19'
N. Lat. and 45º 40' E. Long., and are about four miles from the Euphrates, on the left or east
bank of the river. Sir W. K. Loftus carried out excavations on the site in 1849-52, and says
that the external walls of sun-dried brick enclosing the main portion of the ruins form an
irregular circle five and a half miles in circumference; in places they are from 40 to 50 feet
in height, and they seem to have been about 20 feet thick. The turrets on the wall were semi-oval
in shape, and about 50 feet apart. The principal ruin is that of the Ziggurat, or temple tower,
which in 1850 was 100 feet high and 200 feet square. Loftus calls it "Buwáríya," i.e., "reed
mats," because reed mats were used in its construction, but bûrîyah, "rush mat," is a Persian
not Arabic word, and the name is more probably connected with the Arabic "Bawâr," i.e., "ruin"
"place of death," etc. This tower stood in a courtyard which was 350 feet long and 270 feet
wide. The next large ruin is that which is called "Waswas" (plur. "Wasâwis"), i.e., "large
stone" The "Waswas" referred to was probably the block of columnar basalt which Loftus and
Mr. T. K. Lynch found projecting through the soil; on it was sculptured the figure of a warrior,
and the stone itself was regarded as a talisman by the natives. This ruin is 246 feet long,
174 feet wide and 80 feet high. On three sides of it are terraces of different elevations,
but the south-west side presents a perpendicular façade, at one place 23 feet in height. For
further details see Loftus, Chaldea and Susiana, London, 1857, p. 159 ff. Portions of the ruins
of Warkah were excavated by the German archaeologists in 1914, and large "finds" of tablets
and other antiquities are said to have been made.
