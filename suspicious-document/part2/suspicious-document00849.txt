Meantime a war had been carried on between Elis and Arcadia which had led to disunion among
the Arcadians themselves.  The Mantineans supported the Eleans, who were also assisted by the
Spartans; whilst the rest of the Arcadians, and especially the Tegeans, favoured Thebes. In
B.C. 362 Epaminondas marched into Peloponnesus to support the Theban party in Arcadia, The
Spartans sent a powerful force to the assistance of the Mantineans in whose territory the hostile
armies met.  In the battle which ensued Epaminondas formed his Boeotian troops into a column
of extraordinary depth, with which he bore down all before them. The Mantineans and Lacedaemonians
turned and fled, and the rest followed their example.  The day was won; but Epaminondas, who
fought in the foremost ranks, fell pierced with a mortal wound. His fall occasioned such consternation
among his troops, that, although the enemy were in full flight, they did not know how to use
their advantage, and remained rooted to the spot. Epaminondas was carried off the field with
the spear-head still fixed in his breast.  Having satisfied himself that his shield was safe,
and that the victory was gained, he inquired for Iolaidas and Daiphantus, whom he intended
to succeed him in the command.  Being informed that both were slain: "Then" he observed "you
must make peace."  After this he ordered the spear-head to be withdrawn; when the gush of blood
which followed soon terminated his life.  Thus died this truly great man; and never was there
one whose title to that epithet has been less disputed. Antiquity is unanimous in his praise,
and some of the first men of Greece subsequently took him for their model.  With him the commanding
influence of Thebes began and ended.  His last advice was adopted, and peace was concluded
probably before the Theban army quitted Peloponnesus.  Its basis was a recognition of the STATUS
QUO--to leave everything as it was, to acknowledge the Arcadian constitution and the independence
of Messene.  Sparta alone refused to join it on account of the last article, but she was not
supported by her allies.

Agesilaus had lived to see the empire of Sparta extinguished by her hated rival.  Thus curiously
had the prophecy been fulfilled which warned Sparta of the evils awaiting her under a "lame
sovereignty." But Agesilaus had not yet abandoned all hope; and he now directed his views towards
the east as the quarter from which Spartan power might still be resuscitated.  At the age of
80 the indomitable old man proceeded with a force of 1000 hoplites to assist Tachos, king of
Egypt, in his revolt against Persia.  He died at Cyrene on his return to Greece.  His body
was embalmed in wax and splendidly buried in Sparta.

  On the death of Philomelus, who fell in battle,
the command was assumed by his brother Onomarchus, who carried on the war with vigour and success.
But he was checked in his career by Philip, who had previously been extending his dominion
over Thessaly, and who now assumed the character of a champion of the Delphic god, and made
his soldiers wear wreaths of laurel plucked in the groves of Tempe.  He penetrated into Thessaly,
and encountered the Phocians near the gulf of Pagassae.  In the battle which ensued, Onomarchus
was slain, and his army totally defeated (B.C. 352).  This victory made Philip master of Thessaly.
He now directed his march southwards with the view of subduing the Phocians; but upon reaching
Thermopylae he found the pass guarded by a strong Athenian force, and was compelled, or considered
it more prudent, to retreat.

After his return from Thessaly Philip's views were directed towards Thrace and the Chersonese.
It was at this juncture that Demosthenes stepped forwards as the proclaimed opponent of Philip,
and delivered the first of those celebrated orations which from their subject have been called
"the Philippics."  This most famous of all the Grecian orators was born in B.C. 382-381. Having
lost his father at the early age of seven, his guardians abused their trust, and defrauded
him of the greater part of his paternal inheritance.  This misfortune, however, proved one
of the causes which tended to make him an orator. Demosthenes, as he advanced towards manhood,
perceived with indignation the conduct of his guardians, for which he resolved to make them
answerable when the proper opportunity should arrive, by accusing them himself.  His first
attempt to speak in public proved a failure, and he retired from the bema amidst the hootings
and laughter of the citizens. The more judicious and candid among his auditors perceived, however,
marks of genius in his speech, and rightly attributed his failure to timidity and want of due
preparation.  Eunomus, an aged citizen, who met him wandering about the Piraeus in a state
of dejection at his ill success, bade him take courage and persevere.  Demosthenes now withdrew
awhile from public life, and devoted himself perseveringly to remedy his defects.  They were
such as might be lessened, if not removed, by practice, and consisted chiefly of a weak voice,
imperfect articulation, and ungraceful and inappropriate action. He derived much assistance
from Satyrus the actor, who exercised him in reciting passages from Sophocles and Euripides.
He studied the best rhetorical treatises and orations, and is said to have copied the work
of Thucydides with his own hand no fewer than eight times.  He shut himself up for two or three
months together in a subterranean chamber in order to practise composition and declamation.
His perseverance was crowned with success; and he who on the first attempt had descended from
the bema amid the ridicule of the crowd, became at last the most perfect orator the world has
ever seen.

Demosthenes had established himself as a public speaker before the period which we have now
reached; but it is chiefly in connexion with Philip that we are to view him as a statesman
as well as an orator. Philip had shown his ambition by the conquest of Thessaly, and by the
part he had taken in the Sacred War; and Demosthenes now began to regard him as the enemy of
the liberties of Athens and of Greece.  In his first "Philippic" Demosthenes tried to rouse
his countrymen to energetic measures against this formidable enemy; but his warnings and exhortations
produced little effect, for the Athenians were no longer distinguished by the same spirit of
enterprise which had characterized them in the days of their supremacy.  No important step
was taken to curb the growing power of Philip; and it was the danger of Olynthus which first
induced the Athenians to prosecute the war with a little more energy.  In 350 B.C., Philip
having captured a town in Chalcidice, Olynthus began to tremble for her own safety, and sent
envoys to Athens to crave assistance.  Olynthus was still at the head of thirty-two Greek towns,
and the confederacy was a sort of counterpoise to the power of Philip.  It was on this occasion
that Demosthenes delivered his three Olynthaic orations, in which he warmly advocated an alliance
with Olynthus.

Demosthenes was opposed by a strong party, with which Phocion commonly acted.  Phocion is one
of the most singular and original characters in Grecian history. And possession was syracuse he will

 The satraps of Lydia and
Ionia, together with other Persian generals, were encamped on the river Granicus, with a force
of 20,000 Greek mercenaries, and about an equal number of native cavalry, with which they prepared
to dispute the passage of the river.  A Rhodian, named Memnon, had the chief command. The veteran
general Parmenio advised Alexander to delay the attack till the following morning; to which
he replied, that it would be a bad omen at the beginning of his expedition, if, after passing
the Hellespont, he should be stopped by a paltry stream. Thereupon he directed his cavalry
to cross the river, and followed himself at the head of the phalanx.  The passage, however,
was by no means easy.  The stream was in many parts so deep as to be hardly fordable, and the
opposite bank was steep and rugged.  The cavalry had great difficulty in maintaining their
ground till Alexander came up to their relief.  He immediately charged into the thickest of
the fray, and exposed himself so much that his life was often in imminent danger, and on one
occasion was saved only by the interposition of his friend Clitus.  Having routed the Persians,
he next attacked the Greek mercenaries, 2000 of whom were made prisoners, and the rest nearly
all cut to pieces, In this engagement he killed two Persian officers with his own hand.

Alexander now marched southwards towards Sardis, which surrendered before he came within sight
of its walls.  Having left a garrison in that city, he arrived after a four days' march before
Ephesus, which likewise capitulated on his approach. Magnesia, Tralles, and Miletus next fell
into his hands, the last after a short siege.  Halicarnassus made more resistance.  It was
obliged to be regularly approached; but at length Memnon, finding it no longer tenable, set
fire to it in the night, and crossed over to Cos.  Alexander caused it to be razed to the ground,
and pursued his march along the southern coast of Asia Minor, with the view of seizing those
towns which might afford shelter to a Persian fleet.  The winter was now approaching, and Alexander
sent a considerable part of his army under Parmenio into winter-quarters at Sardis.  He also
sent back to Macedonia such officers and soldiers as had been recently married, on condition
that they should return in the spring with what reinforcements they could raise; and with the
same view he despatched an officer to recruit in the Peloponnesus. By expedition France, but the
dislike which the inaccessible have to fowl it is not therefore calculate

  These, it appears, were all that the breadth of
the plain allowed to be drawn up in line.  The remainder of the vast host were posted in separate
bodies in the farther parts of the plain, and were unable to take any share in the combat.
Darius placed himself in the centre of the line in a magnificent state chariot.  The banks
of the Pinarus were in many parts steep, and where they were level Darius had caused them to
be intrenched.  As Alexander advanced, the Persian cavalry which had been thrown across the
river were recalled; but the 20,000 infantry had been driven into the mountains, where Alexander
held them in check with a small body of horse.  The left wing of the Macedonians, under the
command of Parmenio, was ordered to keep near the sea, to prevent being outflanked.  The right
wing was led by Alexander in person, who rushed impetuously into the water, and was soon engaged
in close combat with the Persians.  The latter were immediately routed; but what chiefly decided
the fortune of the day was the timidity of Darius himself, who, on beholding the defeat of
his left wing, immediately took to flight.  His example was followed by his whole army.  One
hundred thousand Persians are said to have been left upon the field.  On reaching the hills
Darius threw aside his royal robes his bow and shield, and, mounting a fleet courser, was soon
out of reach of pursuit.  The Persian camp became the spoil of the Macedonians; but the tent
of Darius, together with his chariot, robes, and arms, was reserved for Alexander himself.
It was now that the Macedonian king first had ocular proof of the nature of Eastern royalty.
One compartment of the tent of Darius had been fitted up as a bath, which steamed with the
richest odours; whilst another presented a magnificent pavilion, containing a table richly
spread for the banquet of Darius.  But from an adjoining tent issued the wail of female voices,
where Sisygambis the mother, and Statira the wife of Darius, were lamenting the supposed death
of the Persian monarch. Alexander sent to assure them of his safety, and ordered them to be
treated with the most delicate and respectful attention.

Such was the memorable battle of Issus, fought in November, B.C. 333. A large treasure which
Parmenio was sent forward with a detachment to seize, fell into the hands of the Macedonians
at Damascus.  Another favourable result of the victory was that it suppressed some attempts
at revolt from the Macedonian power, which with the support of Persia, had been manifested
in Greece. But, in order to put a complete stop to all such intrigues, which chiefly depended
on the assistance of a Persian fleet, Alexander resolved to seize Phoenicia and Egypt, and
thus to strike at the root of the Persian maritime power.

Meanwhile, Darius, attended by a body of only 4000 fugitives, had crossed the Euphrates at
Thapsacus.  Before he had set out from Babylon the whole forces of the empire had been summoned;
but he had not thought it worth while to wait for what he deemed a merely useless encumbrance;
and the more distant levies, which comprised some of the best troops of the empire, were still
hastening towards Babylon. "himself there may be," "Letter. Their war. rather accomplished,

Meantime Bessus had assumed the royal dignity in Bactria; but upon Alexander's approach he
fled across the Oxus into Sogdiana. Early in the summer of 329 Alexander followed him across
the Oxus; and shortly afterwards Bessus was betrayed by two of his own officers into the hands
of Alexander.  Bessus was carried to Zariaspa, the capital of Bactria, where he was brought
before a Persian court, and put to death in a cruel and barbarous manner.

Alexander even crossed the river Jaxartes (SIR), and defeated the Scythians.  Sogdiana alone
of the northern provinces offered any serious resistance to his arms.  Accordingly in 328 he
again crossed the Oxus.  He divided his army into five bodies, ordering them to scour the country
in different directions. He was roman about it foresaw, he would be nevertheless it succeeded; pilate

Alexander did not leave Bactria till late in the spring.  He crossed the Indus by a bridge
of boats near Taxila, the present ATTOCK, where the river is about 1000 feet broad, and very
deep. He now found himself in the district at present called the PENJ-AB (or the FIVE RIVERS).
Taxiles, the sovereign of the district, at once surrendered Taxila, his capital and joined
the Macedonian force with 5000 men.  Hence Alexander proceeded with little resistance to the
river Haydaspes (BEHUT or JELUM).  On the opposite bank, Porus, a powerful Indian king, prepared
to dispute his progress with a numerous and well-appointed force. Alexander, however, by a
skilful stratagem conveyed his army safely across the river.  An obstinate battle then ensued.
In the army of Porus were many elephants, the sight and smell of which frightened the horses
of Alexander's cavalry.  But these unwieldy animals ultimately proved as dangerous to the Indians
as to the Greeks; for when driven into a narrow space they became unmanageable, and created
great confusion in the ranks of Porus. By a few vigorous charges the Indians were completely
routed, with the loss of 12,000 slain and 9000 prisoners.  Among the latter was Porus himself,
who was conducted into the presence of Alexander.  The courage which he had displayed in the
battle had excited the admiration of the Macedonian king.  Mounted on an enormous elephant,
he retreated leisurely when the day was lost, and long rejected every summons to surrender;
till at length, overcome by thirst and fatigue, he permitted himself to be taken. Even in this
situation Porus still retained his majestic bearing, the effect of which was increased by the
extraordinary height of his stature.  On Alexander's inquiring how he wished to be treated,
he replied, "Like a king."   "And have you no other request?"  asked Alexander.  "No," answered
Porus; "everything is comprehended in the word king."  Struck by his magnanimity, Alexander
not only restored him to his dominions, but also considerably enlarged them; seeking by these
means to retain him as an obedient and faithful vassal.

Alexander rested a month on the banks of the Hydaspes, where he celebrated his victory by games
and sacrifices, and founded two towns one of which he named Nicaea, and the other Bucephala,
in honour of his gallant charger Bucephalus, which is said to have died there.  He then overran
the whole of the PENJ-AB, as far as the Hyphasis (GHARRA), its southern boundary.  Upon reaching
this river, the army, worn out by fatigues and dangers, positively refused to proceed any farther;
although Alexander passionately desired to attack a monarch still more powerful than Porus,
whose dominions lay beyond the Hyphasis.  All his attempts to induce his soldiers to proceed
proving ineffectual, he returned to the Hydaspes, when he ordered part of his army to descend
the river on its opposite banks; whilst he himself at the head of 8000 men, embarked on board
a fleet of about 2000 vessels, which he had ordered to be prepared with the view of sailing
down the Indus to its mouth.

The army began to move in November 327.  The navigation lasted several months, but was accomplished
without any serious opposition, except from the tribe of the Malli, who are conjectured to
have occupied the site of the present MOOLTAN.  At the storming of their town the life of Alexander
was exposed to imminent danger. *****. became out.

  Roxana had previously inveigled Statira and her sister Drypetis to Babylon, where
she caused them to be secretly assassinated.

Perdiccas possessed more power than any of Alexander's generals, and he now aspired to the
Macedonian throne.  His designs, however, were not unknown to Antigonus and Ptolemy; and when
he attempted to bring Antigonus to trial for some offence in the government of his satrapy,
that general made his escape to Macedonia, where he revealed to Antipater the full extent of
the ambitious schemes of Perdiccas, and thus at once induced Antipater and Craterus to unite
in a league with him and Ptolemy, and openly declare war against the regent.  Thus assailed
on all sides, Perdiccas resolved to direct his arms in the first instance against Ptolemy.
In the spring of B.C. 321 he accordingly set out on his march against Egypt, at the head of
a formidable army, and accompanied by Philip Arrhidaeus, and Roxana and her infant son.  He
advanced without opposition as far as Pelusium, but he found the banks of the Nile strongly
fortified and guarded by Ptolemy, and was repulsed in repeated attempts to force the passage
of the river; in the last of which, near Memphis, he lost great numbers of men by the depth
and rapidity of the current.  Perdiccas had never been popular with the soldiery, and these
disasters completely alienated their affections.  A conspiracy was formed against him, and
some of his chief officers murdered him in his tent.

The death of Perdiccas was followed by a fresh distribution of the provinces of the empire.
At a meeting of the generals held at Triparadisus in Syria, towards the end of the year 321
B.C., Antipater was declared regent, retaining the government of Macedonia and Greece; Ptolemy
was continued in the government of Egypt; Seleucus received the satrapy of Babylon; whilst
Antigonus not only retained his old province, but was rewarded with that of Susiana.

Antipater did not long survive these events.  He died in the year 318, at the advanced age
of 80, leaving Polysperchon, one of Alexander's oldest generals, regent; much to the surprise
and mortification of his son Cassander, who received only the secondary dignity of Chiliarch,
or commander of the cavalry. Cassander was now bent on obtaining the regency; but seeing no
hope of success in Macedonia, he went over to Asia to solicit the assistance of Antigonus.

Polysperchon, on his side, sought to conciliate the friendship of the Grecian states, by proclaiming
them all free and independent, and by abolishing the oligarchies which had been set up by Antipater.
In order to enforce these measures, Polysperchon prepared to march into Greece, whilst his
son Alexander was despatched beforehand with an army towards Athens to compel the Macedonian
garrison under the command of Nicanor to evacuate Munychia.  Nicanor, however, refused to move
without orders from Cassander, whose general he declared himself to be. Phocion was suspected
of intriguing in favour of Nicanor, and being accused of treason, fled to Alexander, now encamped
before the walls of Athens.  Alexander sent Phocion to his father, who sent him back to Athens
in chains, to be tried by the Athenian people.  The theatre, where his trial was to take place,
was soon full to overflowing. Phocion was assailed on every side by the clamours of his enemies,
which prevented his defence; from being heard, and he was condemned to death by a show of hands.
To the last Phocion maintained his calm and dignified, but somewhat contemptuous bearing. 
When some wretched man spat upon him as he passed to the prison, "Will no one," said he, "check
this fellow's indecency?"  To one who asked him whether he had any message to leave for his
son Phocus, he answered, "Only that he bear no grudge against the Athenians."  And when the
hemlock which had been prepared was found insufficient for all the condemned, and the jailer
would not furnish more unless he was paid for it, "Give the man his money," said Phocion to
one of his friends, "since at Athens one cannot even die for nothing."  He died in B.C. 317,
at the age of 85. The Athenians afterwards repented of their conduct towards Phocion. His bones,
which had been cast out on the frontiers of Megara, were brought back to Athens, and a bronze
statue was erected to his memory.

Whilst Alexander was negotiating with Nicanor about the surrender of Munychia, Cassander arrived
in the Piraeus with a considerable army, with which Antigonus had supplied him.  Polysperchon
was obliged to retire from Athens, and Cassander established an oligarchical government in
the city under the presidency of Demetrius of Phalerus.

Although Polysperchon was supported by Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, he proved
no match for Cassander, who became master of Macedonia after the fall of Pydna in B.C. 316.
In this city Olympias had taken refuge together with Roxana and her son; but after a blockade
of some months it was obliged to surrender. Olympias had stipulated that her life should be
spared, but Cassander soon afterwards caused her to be murdered, and kept Roxana and her son
in custody in the citadel of Amphipolis. Shortly afterwards Cassander began the restoration
of Thebes (B.C. 315), in the twentieth year after its destruction by Alexander, a measure highly
popular with the Greeks.

A new war now broke out in the East.  Antigonus had become the most powerful of Alexander's
successors.  He had conquered Eumenes, who had long defied his arms, and he now began to dispose
of the provinces as he thought fit.  His increasing power and ambitious projects led to a general
coalition against him, consisting of Ptolemy, Seleucus, Cassander, and Lysimachus, the governor
of Thrace.  The war began in the year 315, and was carried on with great vehemence and alternate
success in Syria, Phoenicia, Asia Minor, and Greece.  After four years all parties became exhausted
with the struggle, and peace was accordingly concluded in 311, on condition that the Greek
cities should be free, that Cassander should retain his authority in Europe till Alexander
came of age, that Ptolemy and Lysimachus should keep possession of Egypt and Thrace respectively,
and that Antigonus should have the government of all Asia.  This hollow peace, which had been
merely patched up for the convenience of the parties concerned, was not of long duration. 
It seems to have been the immediate cause of another of those crimes which disgrace the history
of Alexander's successors. His son, Alexander, who had now attained the age of sixteen, was
still shut up with his mother Roxana in Amphipolis; and his partisans, with injudicious zeal,
loudly expressed their wish that he should be released and placed upon the throne.  In order
to avert this event Cassander contrived the secret murder both of the mother and the son.

This abominable act, however, does not appear to have caused a breach of the peace.  Ptolemy
was the first to break it (B.C. 310), under the pretext that Antigonus, by keeping his garrisons
in the Greek cities of Asia and the islands, had not respected that article of the treaty which
guaranteed Grecian freedom. After the war had lasted three years Antigonus resolved to make
a vigorous effort to wrest Greece from the hands of Cassander and Ptolemy, who held all the
principal towns in it. Accordingly, in the summer of 307 B.C. he despatched his son Demetrius
from Ephesus to Athens, with a fleet of 250 sail, and 5000 talents in money.  Demetrius, who
afterwards obtained the surname of "Poliorcetes," or "Besieger of Cities," was a young man
of ardent temperament and great abilities.  Upon arriving at the Piraeus he immediately proclaimed
the object of his expedition to be the liberation of Athens and the expulsion of the Macedonian
garrison. Supported by the Macedonians, Demetrius the Phalerean had now ruled Athens for a
period of more than ten years.  Of mean birth, Demetrius the Phalerean owed his elevation entirely
to his talents and perseverance.  His skill as an orator raised him to distinction among his
countrymen; and his politics, which led him to embrace the party of Phocion, recommended him
to Cassander and the Macedonians. Juke was proceeded in ecbatana, the talents, and did them unperceived

 They were required to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome, to renounce

crushed, though it seems to have existed, in name at least, till a much later period.

The Achaean league still subsisted but was destined before long to experience the same fate
as its rival.  At first, indeed, it enjoyed the protection of the Romans, and even acquired
an extension of members through their influence, but this protectorate involved a state of
almost absolute dependence. Philopoemen also had succeeded, in the year 192, in adding Sparta
to the league, which now embraced the whole of Peloponnesus.  But Sparta having displayed symptoms
of insubordination, Philopoemen marched against it in 188, and captured the city; when he put
to death eighty of the leading men, razed the walls and fortifications, abolished the institutions

The Greeks possessed two large collections of epic poetry.  The one comprised poems relating
to the great events and enterprises of the Heroic age, and characterised by a certain poetical
unity; the other included works tamer in character and more desultory in their mode of treatment,
containing the genealogies of men and gods, narratives of the exploits of separate heroes,
and descriptions of the ordinary pursuits of life.  The poems of the former class passed under
the name of Homer; while those of the latter were in the same general way ascribed to Hesiod. Of anaximander

 The first book of his History is introductory, and contains a rapid
sketch of Grecian history from the remotest times to the breaking out of the war.  The remaining
seven books are filled with the details of the war, related according to the division into
summers and winters, into which all campaigns naturally fall; and the work breaks off abruptly
in the middle of the 21st year of the war (B.C. 411).  The materials of Thucydides were collected
with the most scrupulous care; the events are related with the strictest impartiality; and
the work probably offers a more exact account of a long and eventful period than any other
contemporary history, whether ancient or modern, of an equally long and important aera. The
style of Thucydides is brief and sententious, and whether in moral or political reasoning,
or in description, gains wonderful force from its condensation.  But this characteristic is
sometimes carried to a faulty extent, so as to render his style harsh, and his meaning obscure.

XENOPHON, the son of Gryllus, was also an Athenian, and was probably born about B.C. 444. 
He was a pupil of Socrates, who saved his life at the battle of Delium (B.C. 424).  His accompanying
Cyrus the younger in his expedition against his brother Artaxerxes, king of Persia, formed
a striking episode in his life, and has been recorded by himself in his ANABASIS.  He seems
to have been still in Asia at the time of the death of Socrates in 399 B.C., and was probably
banished from Athens soon after that period, in consequence of his close connexion with the
Lacedaemonians.  He accompanied Agesilaus, the Spartan king, on the return of the latter from
Asia to Greece; and he fought along with the Lacedaemonians against his own countrymen at the
battle of Coronea in 394 B.C.  After this battle he went with Agesilaus to Sparta, and soon
afterwards settled at Scillus in Elis, near Olympia.  He is said to have lived to more than
90 years of age, and he mentions an event which occurred as late as 357 B.C.

Probably all the works of Xenophon are still extant.  The ANABASIS is the work on which his
fame as an historian chiefly rests.  It is written in a simple and agreeable style, and conveys
much curious and striking information.  The HELLENICA is a continuation of the history of Thucydides,
and comprehends in seven books a space of about 48 years; namely, from the time when Thucydides
breaks off, B.C. 411, to the battle of Mantinea in 362.  The subject is treated in a very dry
and uninteresting style; and his evident partiality to Sparta, and dislike of Athens, have
frequently warped his judgment, and must cause his statements to be received with some suspicion.
The CYROPAEDIA, one of the most pleasing and popular of his works, professes to be a history
of Cyrus, the founder of the Persian monarchy, but is in reality a kind of political romance,
and possesses no authority whatever as an historical work.  The design of the author seems
to have been to draw a picture of a perfect state; and though the scene is laid in Persia,
the materials of the work are derived from his own philosophical notions and the usages of
Sparta engrafted on the popularly current stories respecting Cyrus.  Xenophon displays in this
work his dislike of democratic institutions like those of Athens, and his preference for an
aristocracy, or even a monarchy.  Xenophon was also the author of several minor works; but
the only other treatise which we need mention is the MEMORABILIA of Socrates, in four books,
intended as a defence of his master against the charges which occasioned his death, and which
undoubtedly contains a genuine picture of Socrates and his philosophy.  The genius of Xenophon
was not of the highest order; it was practical rather than speculative; but he is distinguished
for his good sense, his moderate views, his humane temper, and his earnest piety.

The DRAMA pre-eminently distinguished Athenian literature.  The democracy demanded a literature
of a popular kind, the vivacity of the people a literature that made a lively impression; and
both these conditions were fulfilled by the drama.  But though brought to perfection among
the Athenians, tragedy and comedy, in their rude and early origin, were Dorian inventions.
Both arose out of the worship of Dionysus.  There was at first but little distinction between
these two species of the drama, except that comedy belonged more to the rural celebration of
the Dionysiac festivals, and tragedy to that in cities. A is, or although of course, owing to ascra is considerably

and disciples, consisting of about twenty-eight persons, who met in his private house; over
the vestibule of which was inscribed--"Let no one enter who is ignorant of geometry." The most
distinguished of this little band of auditors were Speusippus, his nephew and successor, and
Aristotle.  He died in 347, at the age of 81 or 82, and bequeathed his garden to his school.

ARISTOTLE was born in 381 B.C., at Stagira, a seaport town of Chalcidice, whence he is frequently
called THE STAGIRITE.  At the age of 17, Aristotle, who had then lost both father and mother,
repaired to Athens.  Plato considered him his best scholar, and called him "the intellect of
his school."  Aristotle spent twenty years at Athens, during the last ten of which he established
a school of his own.  In 342 he accepted the invitation of Philip of Macedon to undertake the
instruction of his son Alexander.  In 335, after Alexander had ascended the throne, Aristotle
quitted Macedonia, to which he never returned. He again took up his abode at Athens, where
the Athenians assigned him the gymnasium called the Lyceum; and from his habit of delivering
his lectures whilst walking up and down in the shady walks of this place, his school was called
the PERIPATETIC.  In the morning he lectured only to a select class of pupils, called ESOTERIC.
His afternoon lectures were delivered to a wider circle, and were therefore called EXOTERIC.
It was during the thirteen years in which he presided over the Lyceum that he composed the
greater part of his works, and prosecuted his researches in natural history, in which he was
most liberally assisted by the munificence of Alexander. The latter portion of Aristotle's
life was unfortunate.  He appears to have lost from some unknown cause the friendship of Alexander;
and, after the death of that monarch, the disturbances which ensued in Greece proved unfavourable
to his peace and security.  Being threatened with a prosecution for impiety, he escaped from
Athens and retired to Chalcis; but he was condemned to death in his absence, and deprived of
all the rights and honours which he had previously enjoyed.  He died at Chalcis in 322, in
the 63rd year of his age.

Of all the philosophical systems of antiquity, that of Aristotle was best adapted to the practical
wants of mankind.  It was founded on a close and accurate observation of human nature and of
the external world; but whilst it sought the practical and useful, it did not neglect the beautiful
and noble.

EPICURUS was born at Samos in 342, and settled at Athens at about the age of 35.  Here he purchased
a garden, where he established his philosophical school.  He taught that pleasure is the highest
good; a tenet, however, which he explained and dignified by showing that it was mental pleasure
that he intended.  The ideas of atheism and sensual degradation with which the name of Epicurus
has been so frequently coupled are founded on ignorance of his real teaching.  But as he denied
the immortality of the soul, and the interference of the gods in human affairs,--though he
held their existence,--his tenets were very liable to be abused by those who had not sufficient
elevation of mind to love virtue for its own sake.

ZENO was a native of Citium in the island of Cyprus, and settled at Athens about B.C. 299.
Here he opened a school in the Poecile Stoa, or painted porch, whence the name of his sect.
He inculcated temperance and self-denial, and his practice was in accordance with his precept.
