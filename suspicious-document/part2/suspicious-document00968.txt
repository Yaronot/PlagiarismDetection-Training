CHAPTER V.

CONDITION OF MAN IN THE UNIVERSE.

The Genius, after some moments of silence, resumed in these words:

I have told thee already, O friend of truth! that man vainly ascribes his misfortunes to obscure
and imaginary agents; in vain he seeks as the source of his evils mysterious and remote causes.
In the general order of the universe his condition is, doubtless, subject to inconveniences,
and his existence governed by superior powers; but those powers are neither the decrees of
a blind fatality, nor the caprices of whimsical and fantastic beings. Like the world of which
he forms a part, man is governed by natural laws, regular in their course, uniform in their
effects, immutable in their essence; and those laws,--the common source of good and evil,--are
not written among the distant stars, nor hidden in codes of mystery; inherent in the nature
of terrestrial beings, interwoven with their existence, at all times and in all places, they
are present to man; they act upon his senses, they warn his understanding, and give to every
action its reward or punishment. Let man then know these laws! let him comprehend the nature
of the elements which surround him, and also his own nature, and he will know the regulators
of his destiny; he will know the causes of his evils and the remedies he should apply.

When the hidden power which animates the universe, formed the globe which man inhabits, he
implanted in the beings composing it, essential properties which became the law of their individual
motion, the bond of their reciprocal relations, the cause of the harmony of the whole; he thereby
established a regular order of causes and effects, of principles and consequences, which, under
an appearance of chance, governs the universe, and maintains the equilibrium of the world.
Thus, he gave to fire, motion and activity; to air, elasticity; weight and density to matter;
he made air lighter than water, metal heavier than earth, wood less cohesive than steel; he
decreed flame to ascend, stones to fall, plants to vegetate; to man, who was to be exposed
to the action of so many different beings, and still to preserve his frail life, he gave the
faculty of sensation. By this faculty all action hurtful to his existence gives him a feeling
of pain and evil, and all which is salutary, of pleasure and happiness. By these sensations,
man, sometimes averted from that which wounds his senses, sometimes allured towards that which
soothes them, has been obliged to cherish and preserve his own life; thus, self-love, the desire
of happiness, aversion to pain, become the essential and primary laws imposed on man by nature
herself--the laws which the directing power, whatever it be, has established for his government--and
which laws, like those of motion in the physical world, are the simple and fruitful principle
of whatever happens in the moral world.

Such, then, is the condition of man: on one side, exposed to the action of the elements which
surround him, he is subject to many inevitable evils; and if, in this decree, nature has been
severe, on the other hand, just and even indulgent she has not only tempered the evils with
equivalent good, she has also enabled him to increase the good and alleviate the evil. She
seems to say:

"Feeble work of my hands, I owe thee nothing, and I give thee life; the world wherein I placed
thee was not made for thee, yet I give thee the use of it; thou wilt find in it a mixture of
good and evil; it is for thee to distinguish them; for thee to guide thy footsteps in a path
containing thorns as well as roses. Be the arbiter of thine own fate; I put thy destiny into
thine own hands!"

Yes, man is made the architect of his own destiny; he, himself, hath been the cause of the
successes or reverses of his own fortune; and if, on a review of all the pains with which he
has tormented his own life, he finds reason to weep over his own weakness or imprudence yet,
considering the beginnings from which he sat out, and the height attained, he has, perhaps,
still reason to presume on his strength, and to pride himself on his genius.

CHAPTER VI.

THE PRIMITIVE STATE OF MAN.

Formed naked in body and in mind, man at first found himself thrown, as it were by chance,
on a rough and savage land: an orphan, abandoned by the unknown power which had produced him,
he saw not by his side beings descended from heaven to warn him of those wants which arise
only from his senses, nor to instruct him in those duties which spring only from his wants.
Like to other animals, without experience of the past, without foresight of the future, he
wandered in the bosom of the forest, guided only and governed by the affections of his nature.
By the pain of hunger, he was led to seek food and provide for his subsistence; by the inclemency
of the air, he was urged to cover his body, and he made him clothes; by the attraction of a
powerful pleasure, he approached a being like himself, and he perpetuated his kind.

Thus the impressions which he received from every object, awakening his faculties, developed
by degrees his understanding, and began to instruct his profound ignorance: his wants excited
industry, dangers formed his courage; he learned to distinguish useful from noxious plants,
to combat the elements, to seize his prey, to defend his life; and thus he alleviated its miseries.

Thus self-love, aversion to pain, the desire of happiness, were the simple and powerful excitements
which drew man from the savage and barbarous condition in which nature had placed him. And
now, when his life is replete with enjoyments, when he may count each day by the comforts it
brings, he may applaud himself and say:

"It is I who have produced the comforts which surround me; it is I who am the author of my
own happiness; a safe dwelling, convenient clothing, abundant and wholesome nourishment, smiling
fields, fertile hills, populous empires, all is my work; without me this earth, given up to
disorder, would have been but a filthy fen, a wild wood, a dreary desert."

Yes, creative man, receive my homage! Thou hast measured the span of the heavens, calculated
the volume of the stars, arrested the lightning in its clouds, subdued seas and storms, subjected
all the elements. Ah! how are so many sublime energies allied to so many errors?

CHAPTER VII.

PRINCIPLES OF SOCIETY.

Wandering in the woods and on the banks of rivers in pursuit of game and fish, the first men,
beset with dangers, assailed by enemies, tormented by hunger, by reptiles, by ravenous beasts,
felt their own individual weakness; and, urged by a common need of safety, and a reciprocal
sentiment of like evils, they united their resources and their strength; and when one incurred
a danger, many aided and succored him; when one wanted subsistence, another shared his food
with him. Thus men associated to secure their existence, to augment their powers, to protect
their enjoyments; and self-love thus became the principle of society.

Instructed afterwards by the experience of various and repeated accidents, by the fatigues
of a wandering life, by the distress of frequent scarcity, men reasoned with themselves and said:

"Why consume our days in seeking scattered fruits from a parsimonious soil? why exhaust ourselves
in pursuing prey which eludes us in the woods or waters? why not collect under our hands the
animals that nourish us? why not apply our cares in multiplying and preserving them? We will
feed on their increase, be clothed in their skins, and live exempt from the fatigues of the
day and solicitude for the morrow."

And men, aiding one another, seized the nimble goat, the timid sheep; they tamed the patient
camel, the fierce bull, the impetuous horse; and, applauding their own industry, they sat down
in the joy of their souls, and began to taste repose and comfort: and self-love, the principle
of all reasoning, became the incitement to every art, and every enjoyment.

When, therefore, men could pass long days in leisure, and in communication of their thoughts,
they began to contemplate the earth, the heavens, and their own existence as objects of curiosity
and reflection; they remarked the course of the seasons, the action of the elements, the properties
of fruits and plants; and applied their thoughts to the multiplication of their enjoyments.
And in some countries, having observed that certain seeds contained a wholesome nourishment
in a small volume, convenient for transportation and preservation, they imitated the process
of nature; they confided to the earth rice, barley, and corn, which multiplied to the full
measure of their hope; and having found the means of obtaining within a small compass and without
removal, plentiful subsistence and durable stores, they established themselves in fixed habitations;
they built houses, villages, and towns; formed societies and nations; and self-love produced
all the developments of genius and of power.

Thus by the aid of his own faculties, man has raised himself to the astonishing height of his
present fortune. Too happy if, observing scrupulously the law of his being, he had faithfully
fulfilled its only and true object! But, by a fatal imprudence, sometimes mistaking, sometimes
transgressing its limits, he has launched forth into a labyrinth of errors and misfortunes;
and self-love, sometimes unruly, sometimes blind, became a principle fruitful in calamities.

CHAPTER VIII.

SOURCES OF THE EVILS OF SOCIETY.

In truth, scarcely were the faculties of men developed, when, inveigled by objects which gratify
the senses, they gave themselves up to unbridled desires. The sweet sensations which nature
had attached to their real wants, to endear to them their existence, no longer satisfied them.
Not content with the abundance offered by the earth or produced by industry, they wished to
accumulate enjoyments and coveted those possessed by their fellow men. The strong man rose
up against the feeble, to take from him the fruit of his labor; the feeble invoked another
feeble one to repel the violence. Two strong ones then said:

"Why fatigue ourselves to produce enjoyments which we may find in the hands of the weak? Let
us join and despoil them; they shall labor for us, and we will enjoy without labor."

And the strong associating for oppression and the weak for resistance, men mutually afflicted
each other; and a general and fatal discord spread over the earth, in which the passions, assuming
a thousand new forms, have generated a continued chain of misfortunes.

Thus the same self-love which, moderate and prudent, was a principle of happiness and perfection,
becoming blind and disordered, was transformed into a corrupting poison; and cupidity, offspring
and companion of ignorance, became the cause of all the evils that have desolated the earth.

Yes, ignorance and cupidity! these are the twin sources of all the torments of man! Biased
by these into false ideas of happiness, he has mistaken or broken the laws of nature in his
own relation with external objects; and injuring his own existence, has violated individual
morality; shutting through these his heart to compassion, and his mind to justice, he has injured
and afflicted his equal, and violated social morality. From ignorance and cupidity, man has
armed against man, family against family, tribe against tribe; and the earth is become a theatre
of blood, of discord, and of rapine. By ignorance and cupidity, a secret war, fermenting in
the bosom of every state, has separated citizen from citizen; and the same society has divided
itself into oppressors and oppressed, into masters and slaves; by these, the heads of a nation,
sometimes insolent and audacious, have forged its chains within its own bowels; and mercenary
avarice has founded political despotism. Sometimes, hypocritical and cunning, they have called
from heaven a lying power, and a sacrilegious yoke; and credulous cupidity has founded religious
despotism. By these have been perverted the ideas of good and evil, just and unjust, vice and
virtue; and nations have wandered in a labyrinth of errors and calamities.

The cupidity of man and his ignorance,--these are the evil genii which have wasted the earth!
These are the decrees of fate which have overthrown empires! These are the celestial anathemas
which have smitten these walls once so glorious, and converted the splendor of a populous city
into a solitude of mourning and of ruins! But as in the bosom of man have sprung all the evils
which have afflicted his life, there he also is to seek and to find their remedies.

CHAPTER IX.

ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT AND LAWS.

In fact, it soon happened that men, fatigued with the evils they reciprocally inflicted, began
to sigh for peace; and reflecting on their misfortunes and the causes of them, they said:

"We are mutually injuring each other by our passions; and, aiming to grasp every thing, we
hold nothing. What one seizes to-day, another takes to-morrow, and our cupidity reacts upon
ourselves. Let us establish judges, who shall arbitrate our rights, and settle our differences!
When the strong shall rise against the weak, the judge shall restrain him, and dispose of our
force to suppress violence; and the life and property of each shall be under the guarantee
and protection of all; and all shall enjoy the good things of nature."

Conventions were thus formed in society, sometimes express, sometimes tacit, which became the
rule for the action of individuals, the measure of their rights, the law of their reciprocal
relations; and persons were appointed to superintend their observance, to whom the people confided
the balance to weigh rights, and the sword to punish transgressions.

Thus was established among individuals a happy equilibrium of force and action, which constituted
the common security. The name of equity and of justice was recognized and revered over the
earth; every one, assured of enjoying in peace, the fruits of his toil, pursued with energy
the objects of his attention; and industry, excited and maintained by the reality or the hope
of enjoyment, developed, all the riches of art and of nature. The fields were covered with
harvests, the valleys with flocks, the hills with fruits, the sea with vessels, and man became
happy and powerful on the earth. Thus did his own wisdom repair the disorder which his imprudence
had occasioned; and that wisdom was only the effect of his own organization. He respected the
enjoyments of others in order to secure his own; and cupidity found its corrective in the enlightened
love of self.

Thus the love of self, the moving principle of every individual, becomes the necessary foundation
of every association; and on the observance of that law of our nature has depended the fate
of nations. Have the factitious and conventional laws tended to that object and accomplished
that aim? Every one, urged by a powerful instinct, has displayed all the faculties of his being;
and the sum of individual felicities has constituted the general felicity. Have these laws,
on the contrary, restrained the effort of man toward his own happiness? His heart, deprived
of its exciting principle, has languished in inactivity, and from the oppression of individuals
has resulted the weakness of the state.

As self-love, impetuous and improvident, is ever urging man against his equal, and consequently
tends to dissolve society, the art of legislation and the merit of administrators consists
in attempering the conflict of individual cupidities, in maintaining an equilibrium of powers,
and securing to every one his happiness, in order that, in the shock of society against society,
all the members may have a common interest in the preservation and defence of the public welfare.

The internal splendor and prosperity of empires then, have had for their efficient cause the
equity of their laws and government; and their respective external powers have been in proportion
to the number of persons interested, and their degree of interest in the public welfare.

On the other hand, the multiplication of men, by complicating their relations, having rendered
the precise limitation of their rights difficult, the perpetual play of the passions having
produced incidents not foreseen--their conventions having been vicious, inadequate, or nugatory--in
fine, the authors of the laws having sometimes mistaken, sometimes disguised their objects;
and their ministers, instead of restraining the cupidity of others, having given themselves
up to their own; all these causes have introduced disorder and trouble into societies; and
the viciousness of laws and the injustice of governments, flowing from cupidity and ignorance,
have become the causes of the misfortunes of nations, and the subversion of states.

CHAPTER X.

GENERAL CAUSES OF THE PROSPERITY OF ANCIENT STATES.

Such, O man who seekest wisdom, such have been the causes of revolution in the ancient states
of which thou contemplatest the ruins! To whatever spot I direct my view, to whatever period
my thoughts recur, the same principles of growth or destruction, of rise or fall, present themselves
to my mind. Wherever a people is powerful, or an empire prosperous, there the conventional
laws are conformable with the laws of nature--the government there procures for its citizens
a free use of their faculties, equal security for their persons and property. If, on the contrary,
an empire goes to ruin, or dissolves, it is because its laws have been vicious, or imperfect,
or trodden under foot by a corrupt government. If the laws and government, at first wise and
just, become afterwards depraved, it is because the alternation of good and evil is inherent
to the heart of man, to a change in his propensities, to his progress in knowledge, to a combination
of circumstances and events; as is proved by the history of the species.

In the infancy of nations, when men yet lived in the forest, subject to the same wants, endowed
with the same faculties, all were nearly equal in strength; and that equality was a circumstance
highly advantageous in the composition of society: as every individual, thus feeling himself
sufficiently independent of every other, no one was the slave, none thought of being the master
of another. Man, then a novice, knew neither servitude nor tyranny; furnished with resources
sufficient for his existence, he thought not of borrowing from others; owning nothing, requiring
nothing, he judged the rights of others by his own, and formed ideas of justice sufficiently
exact. Ignorant, moreover, in the art of enjoyments, unable to produce more than his necessaries,
possessing nothing superfluous, cupidity remained dormant; or if excited, man, attacked in
his real wants, resisted it with energy, and the foresight of such resistance ensured a happy
balance.

Thus original equality, in default of compact, maintained freedom of person, security of property,
good manners, and order. Every one labored by himself and for himself; and the mind of man,
being occupied, wandered not to culpable desires. He had few enjoyments, but his wants were
satisfied; and as indulgent nature had made them less than his resources, the labor of his
hands soon produced abundance--abundance, population; the arts unfolded, culture extended,
and the earth, covered with numerous inhabitants, was divided into different dominions.

The relations of man becoming complicated, the internal order of societies became more difficult
to maintain. Time and industry having generated riches, cupidity became more active; and because
equality, practicable among individuals, could not subsist among families, the natural equilibrium
was broken; it became necessary to supply it by a factitious equilibrium; to set up chiefs,
to establish laws; and in the primitive inexperience, it necessarily happened that these laws,
occasioned by cupidity, assumed its character. But different circumstances concurred to correct
the disorder, and oblige governments to be just.

States, in fact, being weak at first, and having foreign enemies to fear, the chiefs found
it their interest not to oppress their subjects; for, by lessening the confidence of the citizens
in their government, they would diminish their means of resistance--they would facilitate foreign
invasion, and by exercising arbitrary power, have endangered their very existence.

In the interior, the firmness of the people repelled tyranny; men had contracted too long habits
of independence; they had too few wants, and too much consciousness of their own strength.

States being of a moderate size, it was difficult to divide their citizens so as to make use
of some for the oppression of others. Their communications were too easy, their interest too
clear and simple: besides, every one being a proprietor and cultivator, no one needed to sell
himself, and the despot could find no mercenaries.

If, then, dissensions arose, they were between family and family, faction and faction, and
they interested a great number. The troubles, indeed, were warmer; but fears from abroad pacified
discord at home. If the oppression of a party prevailed, the earth being still unoccupied,
and man, still in a state of simplicity, finding every where the same advantages, the oppressed
party emigrated, and carried elsewhere their independence.

The ancient states then enjoyed within themselves numerous means of prosperity and power. Every
one finding his own well-being in the constitution of his country, took a lively interest in
its preservation. If a stranger attacked it, having to defend his own field, his own house,
he carried into combat all the passions of a personal quarrel; and, devoted to his own interests,
he was devoted to his country.

As every action useful to the public attracted its esteem and gratitude, every one became eager
to be useful; and self-love multiplied talents and civic virtues.

Every citizen contributing equally by his talents and person, armies and funds were inexhaustible,
and nations displayed formidable masses of power.

The earth being free, and its possession secure and easy, every one was a proprietor; and the
division of property preserved morals, and rendered luxury impossible.

Every one cultivating for himself, culture was more active, produce more abundant; and individual
riches became public wealth.

The abundance of produce rendering subsistence easy, population was rapid and numerous, and
states attained quickly the term of their plenitude.

Productions increasing beyond consumption, the necessity of commerce arose; and exchanges took
place between people and people; which augmented their activity and reciprocal advantages.

In fine, certain countries, at certain times, uniting the advantages of good government with
a position on the route of the most active circulation, they became emporiums of flourishing
commerce and seats of powerful domination. And on the shores of the Nile and Mediterranean,
of the Tygris and Euphrates, the accumulated riches of India and of Europe raised in successive
splendor a hundred different cities.

The people, growing rich, applied their superfluity to works of common and public use; and
this was in every state, the epoch of those works whose grandeur astonishes the mind; of those
wells of Tyre, of those dykes of the Euphrates, of those subterranean conduits of Media,* of
those fortresses of the desert, of those aqueducts of Palmyra, of those temples, of those porticoes.
And such labors might be immense, without oppressing the nations; because they were the effect
of an equal and common contribution of the force of individuals animated and free.

     * See respecting these monuments my Travels into Syria, vol.
     ii. p. 214.

From the town or village of Samouat the course of the Euphrates is accompanied with a double
bank, which descends as far as its junction with the Tygris, and from thence to the sea, being
a length of about a hundred leagues, French measure. The height of these artificial banks is
not uniform, but increases as you advance from the sea; it may be estimated at from twelve
to fifteen feet. But for them, the inundation of the river would bury the country around, which
is flat, to an extent of twenty or twenty-five leagues and even notwithstanding these banks,
there has been in modern times an overflow, which has covered the whole triangle formed by
the junction of this river to the Tygris, being a space of country of one hundred and thirty
square leagues. By the stagnation of these waters an epidemical disease of the most fatal nature
was occasioned. It follows from hence, 1. That all the flat country bordering upon these rivers,
was originally a marsh; 2. That this marsh could not have been inhabited previously to the
construction of the banks in question; 3. That these banks could not have been the work but
of a population prior as to date; and the elevation of Babylon, therefore, must have been posterior
to that of Nineveh, as I think I have chronologically demonstrated in the memoir above cited.
See Encyclopedia, vol. xiii, of Antiquities.

The modern Aderbidjan, which was a part of Medea, the mountains of Koulderstan, and those of
Diarbekr, abound with subterranean canals, by means of which the ancient inhabitants conveyed
water to their parched soil in order to fertilize it. It was regarded as a meritorious act
and a religious duty prescribed by Zoroaster, who, instead of preaching celibacy, mortifications,
and other pretended virtues of the monkish sort, repeats continually in the passages that are
preserved respecting him in the Sad-der and the Zend-avesta:

"That the action most pleasing to God is to plough and cultivate the earth, to water it with
running streams, to multiply vegetation and living beings, to have numerous flocks, young and
fruitful virgins, a multitude of children," etc., etc.

Among the aqueducts of Palmyra it appears certain, that, besides those which conducted water
from the neighboring hills, there was one which brought it even from the mountains of Syria.
It is to be traced a long way into the Desert where it escapes our search by going under ground.

Thus ancient states prospered, because their social institutions conformed to the true laws
of nature; and because men, enjoying liberty and security for their persons and their property,
might display all the extent of their faculties,--all the energies of their self-love.

CHAPTER XI.

GENERAL CAUSES OF THE REVOLUTIONS AND RUIN OF ANCIENT STATES.

Cupidity had nevertheless excited among men a constant and universal conflict, which incessantly
prompting individuals and societies to reciprocal invasions, occasioned successive revolutions,
and returning agitations.

And first, in the savage and barbarous state of the first men, this audacious and fierce cupidity
produced rapine, violence, and murder, and retarded for a long time the progress of civilization.

When afterwards societies began to be formed, the effect of bad habits, communicated to laws
and governments, corrupted their institutions and objects, and established arbitrary and factitious
rights, which depraved the ideas of justice, and the morality of the people.

And these vices having enervated the states of the wealthy part of Asia, the vagrant and indigent
people of the adjacent deserts and mountains coveted the enjoyments of the fertile plains;
and, urged by a cupidity common to all, attacked the polished empires, and overturned the thrones
of their despots. These revolutions were rapid and easy; because the policy of tyrants had
enfeebled the subjects, razed the fortresses, destroyed the warriors; and because the oppressed
subjects remained without personal interest, and the mercenary soldiers without courage.

And hordes of barbarians having reduced entire nations to slavery, the empires, formed of conquerors
and conquered, united in their bosom two classes essentially opposite and hostile. All the
principles of society were dissolved: there was no longer any common interest, no longer any
public spirit; and there arose a distinction of casts and races, which reduced to a regular
system the maintenance of disorder; and he who was born of this or that blood, was born a slave
or a tyrant--property or proprietor.

The oppressors being less numerous than the oppressed it was necessary to perfect the science
of oppression, in order to support this false equilibrium. The art of governing became the
art of subjecting the many to the few. To enforce an obedience so contrary to instinct, the
severest punishments were established, and the cruelty of the laws rendered manners atrocious.
The distinction of persons establishing in the state two codes, two orders of criminal justice,
two sets of laws, the people, placed between the propensities of the heart and the oath uttered
from the mouth, had two consciences in contradiction with each other; and the ideas of justice
and injustice had no longer any foundation in the understanding.

Under such a system, the people fell into dejection and despair; and the accidents of nature
were added to the other evils which assailed them. Prostrated by so many calamities, they attributed
their causes to superior and hidden powers; and, because they had tyrants on earth, they fancied
others in heaven; and superstition aggravated the misfortunes of nations.

Fatal doctrines and gloomy and misanthropic systems of religion arose, which painted their
gods, like their despots, wicked and envious. To appease them, man offered up the sacrifice
of all his enjoyments. He environed himself in privations, and reversed the order of nature.
Conceiving his pleasures to be crimes, his sufferings expiations, he endeavored to love pain,
and to abjure the love of self. He persecuted his senses, hated his life; and a self-denying
and anti-social morality plunged nations into the apathy of death.

But provident nature having endowed the heart of man with hope inexhaustible, when his desires
of happiness were baffled on this earth, he pursued it into another world. By a sweet illusion
he created for himself another country--an asylum where, far from tyrants, he should recover
the rights of nature, and thence resulted new disorders. Smitten with an imaginary world, man
despised that of nature. For chimerical hopes, he neglected realities. His life began to appear
a troublesome journey--a painful dream; his body a prison, the obstacle to his felicity; and
the earth, a place of exile and of pilgrimage, not worthy of culture. Then a holy indolence
spread over the political world; the fields were deserted, empires depopulated, monuments neglected
and deserts multiplied; ignorance, superstition and fanaticism, combining their operations,
overwhelmed the earth with devastation and ruin.

Thus agitated by their own passions, men, whether collectively or individually taken, always
greedy and improvident, passing from slavery to tyranny, from pride to baseness, from presumption
to despondency, have made themselves the perpetual instruments of their own misfortunes.

These, then, are the principles, simple and natural, which regulated the destiny of ancient
states. By this regular and connected series of causes and effects, they rose or fell, in proportion
as the physical laws of the human heart were respected or violated; and in the course of their
successive changes, a hundred different nations, a hundred different empires, by turns humbled,
elevated, conquered, overthrown, have repeated for the earth their instructive lessons. Yet
these lessons were lost for the generations which have followed! The disorders in times past
have reappeared in the present age! The chiefs of the nations have continued to walk in the
paths of falsehood and tyranny!--the people to wander in the darkness of superstition and ignorance!

Since then, continued the Genius, with renewed energy, since the experience of past ages is
lost for the living--since the errors of progenitors have not instructed their descendants,
the ancient examples are about to reappear; the earth will see renewed the tremendous scenes
it has forgotten. New revolutions will agitate nations and empires; powerful thrones will again
be overturned, and terrible catastrophes will again teach mankind that the laws of nature and
the precepts of wisdom and truth cannot be infringed with impunity.

CHAPTER XII.

LESSONS OF TIMES PAST REPEATED ON THE PRESENT.

Thus spoke the Genius. Struck with the justice and coherence of his discourse, assailed with
a crowd of ideas, repugnant to my habits yet convincing to my reason, I remained absorbed in
profound silence. At length, while with serious and pensive mien, I kept my eyes fixed on Asia,
suddenly in the north, on the shores of the Black sea, and in the fields of the Crimea, clouds
of smoke and flame attracted my attention. They appeared to rise at the same time from all
parts of the peninsula; and passing by the isthmus into the continent, they ran, as if driven
by a westerly wind, along the oozy lake of Azof, and disappeared in the grassy plains of Couban;
and following more attentively the course of these clouds, I observed that they were preceded
or followed by swarms of moving creatures, which, like ants or grasshoppers disturbed by the
foot of a passenger, agitated themselves with vivacity. Sometimes these swarms appeared to
advance and rush against each other; and numbers, after the concussion, remained motionless.
While disquieted at this spectacle, I strained my sight to distinguish the objects.

Do you see, said the Genius, those flames which spread over the earth, and do you comprehend
their causes and effects?

Oh! Genius, I answered, I see those columns of flame and smoke, and something like insects,
accompanying them; but, when I can scarcely discern the great masses of cities and monuments,
how should I discover, such little creatures? I can just perceive that these insects mimic
battle, for they advance, retreat, attack and pursue.

It is no mimicry, said the Genius, these are real battles.

And what, said I, are those mad animalculae, which destroy each other? Beings of a day! will
they not perish soon enough?

Then the Genius, touching my sight and hearing, again directed my eyes towards the same object.
Look, said he, and listen!

Ah! wretches, cried I, oppressed with grief, these columns of flame! these insects! oh! Genius,
they are men. These are the ravages of war! These torrents of flame rise from towns and villages!
I see the squadrons who kindle them, and who, sword in hand overrun the country: they drive
before them crowds of old men, women, and children, fugitive and desolate: I perceive other
horsemen, who with shouldered lances, accompany and guide them. I even recognize them to be
Tartars by their led horses,* their kalpacks, and tufts of hair: and, doubtless, they who pursue,
in triangular hats and green uniforms, are Muscovites. Ah! I now comprehend, a war is kindled
between the empire of the Czars and that of the Sultans.

     * A Tartar horseman has always two horses, of which he leads
     one in hand.  The Kalpeck is a bonnet made of the skin of a
     sheep or other animal.  The part of the head covered by this
     bonnet is shaved, with the exception of a tuft, about the
     size of a crown piece, and which is suffered to grow to the
     length of seven or eight inches, precisely where our priests
     place their tonsure.  It is by this tuft of hair, worn by
     the majority of Mussulmen, that the angel of the tomb is to
     take the elect and carry them into paradise.

Not yet, replied the Genius; this is only a preliminary. These Tartars have been, and might
still he troublesome neighbors. The Muscovites are driving them off, finding their country
would be a convenient extension of their own limits; and as a prelude to another revolution,
the throne of the Guerais is destroyed.

And in fact, I saw the Russian standards floating over the Crimea: and soon after their flag
waving on the Euxine.

Meanwhile, at the cry of the flying Tartars, the Mussulman empire was in commotion. They are
driving off our brethren, cried the children of Mahomet: the people of the prophet are outraged!
infidels occupy a consecrated land and profane the temples of Islamism.* Let us arm; let us
rush to combat, to avenge the glory of God and our own cause.

     * It is not in the power of the Sultan to cede to a foreign
     power a province inhabited by true believers.  The people,
     instigated by the lawyers, would not fail to revolt.  This
     is one reason which has led those who know the Turks, to
     regard as chimerical the ceding of Candia, Cyprus, and
     Egypt, projected by certain European potentates.

And a general movement of war took place in both empires. In every part armed men assembled.
Provisions, stores, and all the murderous apparatus of battle were displayed. The temples of
both nations, besieged by an immense multitude, presented a spectacle which fixed all my attention.

On one side, the Mussulmen gathered before their mosques, washed their hands and feet, pared
their nails, and combed their beards; then spreading carpets upon the ground, and turning towards
the south, with their arms sometimes crossed and sometimes extended, they made genuflexions
and prostrations, and recollecting the disasters of the late war, they exclaimed:

God of mercy and clemency! hast thou then abandoned thy faithful people? Thou who hast promised
to thy Prophet dominion over nations, and stamped his religion by so many triumphs, dost thou
deliver thy true believers to the swords of infidels?

And the Imans and the Santons said to the people:

It is in chastisement of your sins. You eat pork; you drink wine; you touch unclean things.
God hath punished you. Do penance therefore; purify; repeat the profession of faith;* fast
from the rising to the setting sun; give the tenth of your goods to the mosques; go to Mecca;
and God will render you victorious.

     * There is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet.

And the people, recovering courage, uttered loud cries:

There is but one God, said they transported with fury, and Mahomet is his prophet! Accursed
be he who believeth not!

God of goodness, grant us to exterminate these Christians; it is for thy glory we fight, and
our death is a martyrdom for thy name. And then, offering victims, they prepared for battle.

On the other side, the Russians, kneeling, said:

We render thanks to God, and celebrate his power. He hath strengthened our arm to humble his
enemies. Hear our prayers, thou God of mercy! To please thee, we will pass three days without
eating either meat or eggs. Grant us to extirpate these impious Mahometans, and to overturn
their empire. To thee we will consecrate the tenth of our spoil; to thee we will raise new temples.

And the priests filled the churches with clouds of smoke, and said to the people:

We pray for you, God accepteth our incense, and blesseth your arms. Continue to fast and to
fight; confess to us your secret sins; give your wealth to the church; we will absolve you
from your crimes, and you shall die in a state of grace.

And they sprinkled water upon the people, dealt out to them, as amulets and charms, small relics
of the dead, and the people breathed war and combat.

Struck with this contrast of the same passions, and grieving for their fatal consequences,
I was considering the difficulty with which the common judge could yield to prayers so contradictory;
when the Genius, glowing with anger, spoke with vehemence:

What accents of madness strike my ear? What blind and perverse delirium disorders the spirits
of the nations? Sacrilegious prayers rise not from the earth! and you, oh Heavens, reject their
homicidal vows and impious thanksgivings! Deluded mortals! is it thus you revere the Divinity?
Say then; how should he, whom you style your common father, receive the homage of his children
murdering one another? Ye victors! with what eye should he view your hands reeking in the blood
he hath created? And, what do you expect, oh vanquished, from useless groans? Hath God the
heart of a mortal, with passions ever changing? Is he, like you, agitated with vengeance or
compassion, with wrath or repentance? What base conception of the most sublime of beings! According
to them, it would seem, that God whimsical and capricious, is angered or appeased as a man:
that he loves and hates alternately; that he punishes or favors; that, weak or wicked, he broods
over his hatred; that, contradictory or perfidious, he lays snares to entrap; that he punishes
the evils he permits; that he foresees but hinders not crimes; that, like a corrupt judge,
he is bribed by offerings; like an ignorant despot, he makes laws and revokes them; that, like
a savage tyrant, he grants or resumes favors without reason, and can only be appeased by servility.
Ah! now I know the lying spirit of man! Contemplating the picture which he hath drawn of the
Divinity: No, said I, it is not God who hath made man after the image of God; but man hath
made God after the image of man; he hath given him his own mind, clothed him with his own propensities;
ascribed to him his own judgments. And when in this medley he finds the contradiction of his
own principles, with hypocritical humility, he imputes weakness to his reason, and names the
absurdities of his own mind the mysteries of God.

He hath said, God is immutable, yet he offers prayers to change him; he hath pronounced him
incomprehensible, yet he interprets him without ceasing.

Imposters have arisen on the earth who have called themselves the confidants of God; and, erecting
themselves into teachers of the people, have opened the ways of falsehood and iniquity; they
have ascribed merit to practices indifferent or ridiculous; they have supposed a virtue, in
certain postures, in pronouncing certain words, articulating certain names; they have transformed
into a crime the eating of certain meats, the drinking of certain liquors, on one day rather
than another. The Jew would rather die than labor on the sabbath; the Persian would endure
suffocation, before he would blow the fire with his breath; the Indian places supreme perfection
in besmearing himself with cow-dung, and pronouncing mysteriously the word Aum;* the Mussulman
believes he has expiated everything in washing his head and arms; and disputes, sword in hand,
whether the ablution should commence at the elbow, or finger ends;** the Christian would think
himself damned, if he ate flesh instead of milk or butter. Oh sublime doctrines! Doctrines
truly from heaven! Oh perfect morals, and worthy of martyrdom or the apostolate! I will cross
the seas to teach these admirable laws to the savage people--to distant nations; I will say
unto them:

     * This word is, in the religion of the Hindoos, a sacred
     emblem of the Divinity.  It is only to be pronounced in
     secret, without being heard by any one.  It is formed of
     three letters, of which the first, a, signifies the
     principal of all, the creator, Brama; the second, u, the
     conservator, Vichenou; and the last, m, the destroyer, who
     puts an end to all, Chiven.  It is pronounced like the
     monosyllable om, and expresses the unity of those three
     Gods. The idea is precisely that of the Alpha and Omega
     mentioned in the New Testament.

     ** This is one of the grand points of schism between the
     partisans of Omar and those of Ali.  Suppose two Mahometans
     to meet on a journey, and to accost each other with
     brotherly affection: the hour of prayer arrives; one begins
     his ablution at his fingers, the other at the elbow, and
     instantly they are mortal enemies.  O sublime importance of
     religious opinions!  O profound philosophy of the authors of
     them!

Children of nature, how long will you walk in the paths of ignorance? how long will you mistake
the true principles of morality and religion? Come and learn its lessons from nations truly
pious and learned, in civilized countries. They will inform you how, to gratify God, you must
in certain months of the year, languish the whole day with hunger and thirst; how you may shed
your neighbor's blood, and purify yourself from it by professions of faith and methodical ablutions;
how you may steal his property and be absolved on sharing it with certain persons, who devote
themselves to its consumption.

Sovereign and invisible power of the universe! mysterious mover of nature! universal soul of
beings! thou who art unknown, yet revered by mortals under so many names! being incomprehensible
and infinite! God, who in the immensity of the heavens directest the movement of worlds, and
peoplest the abyss of space with millions of suns! say what do these human insects, which my
sight no longer discerns on the earth, appear in thy eyes? To thee, who art guiding stars in
their orbits, what are those wormlings writhing themselves in the dust? Of what import to thy
immensity, their distinctions of parties and sects? And of what concern the subtleties with
which their folly torments itself?

And you, credulous men, show me the effect of your practices! In so many centuries, during
which you have been following or altering them, what changes have your prescriptions wrought
in the laws of nature? Is the sun brighter? Is the course of the seasons varied? Is the earth
more fruitful, or its inhabitants more happy? If God be good, can your penances please him?
If infinite, can your homage add to his glory? If his decrees have been formed on foresight
of every circumstance, can your prayers change them? Answer, O inconsistent mortals!

Ye conquerors of the earth, who pretend you serve God! doth he need your aid? If he wishes
to punish, hath he not earthquakes, volcanoes, and thunder? And cannot a merciful God correct
without extermination?

Ye Mussulmans, if God chastiseth you for violating the five precepts, how hath he raised up
the Franks who ridicule them? If he governeth the earth by the Koran, by what did he govern
it before the days of the prophet, when it was covered with so many nations who drank wine,
ate pork, and went not to Mecca, whom he nevertheless permitted to raise powerful empires?
How did he judge the Sabeans of Nineveh and of Babylon; the Persian, worshipper of fire; the
Greek and Roman idolators; the ancient kingdoms of the Nile; and your own ancestors, the Arabians
and Tartars? How doth he yet judge so many nations who deny, or know not your worship--the
numerous castes of Indians, the vast empire of the Chinese, the sable race of Africa, the islanders
of the ocean, the tribes of America?

Presumptuous and ignorant men, who arrogate the earth to yourselves! if God were to gather
all the generations past and present, what would be, in their ocean, the sects calling themselves
universal, of Christians and Mussulmans? What would be the judgments of his equal and common
justice over the real universality of mankind? Therein it is that your knowledge loseth itself
in incoherent systems; it is there that truth shines with evidence; and there are manifested
the powerful and simple laws of nature and reason--laws of a common and general mover--of a
God impartial and just, who sheds rain on a country without asking who is its prophet; who
causeth his sun to shine alike on all the races of men, on the white as on the black, on the
Jew, on the Mussulman, the Christian, and the Idolater; who reareth the harvest wherever cultivated
with diligence; who multiplieth every nation where industry and order prevaileth; who prospereth
every empire where justice is practised, where the powerful are restrained, and the poor protected
by the laws; where the weak live in safety, and all enjoy the rights given by nature and a
compact formed in justice.

These are the principles by which people are judged! this the true religion which regulates
the destiny of empires, and which, O Ottomans, hath governed yours! Interrogate your ancestors,
ask of them by what means they rose to greatness; when few, poor and idolaters, they came from
the deserts of Tartary and encamped in these fertile countries; ask if it was by Islamism,
till then unknown to them, that they conquered the Greeks and the Arabs, or was it by their
courage, their prudence, moderation, spirit of union--the true powers of the social state?
Then the Sultan himself dispensed justice, and maintained discipline. The prevaricating judge,
the extortionate governor, were punished, and the multitude lived at ease. The cultivator was
protected from the rapine of the janissary, and the fields prospered; the highways were safe,
and commerce caused abundance. You were a band of plunderers, but just among yourselves. You
subdued nations, but did not oppress them. Harassed by their own princes, they preferred being
your tributaries. What matters it, said the Christian, whether my ruler breaks or adores images,
if he renders justice to me? God will judge his doctrines in the heavens above.

You were sober and hardy; your enemies timid and enervated; you were expert in battle, your
enemies unskillful; your leaders were experienced, your soldiers warlike and disciplined. Booty
excited ardor, bravery was rewarded, cowardice and insubordination punished, and all the springs
of the human heart were in action. Thus you vanquished a hundred nations, and of a mass of
conquered kingdoms compounded an immense empire.

But other customs have succeeded; and in the reverses attending them, the laws of nature have
still exerted their force. After devouring your enemies, your cupidity, still insatiable, has
reacted on itself, and, concentrated in your own bowels, has consumed you.

Having become rich, you have quarrelled for partition and enjoyment, and disorder hath arisen
in every class of society.

The Sultan, intoxicated with grandeur, has mistaken the object of his functions; and all the
vices of arbitrary power have been developed. Meeting no obstacle to his appetites, he has
become a depraved being; weak and arrogant, he has kept the people at a distance; and their
voice has no longer instructed and guided him. Ignorant, yet flattered, neglecting all instruction,
all study, he has fallen into imbecility; unfit for business, he has thrown its burdens on
hirelings, and they have deceived him. To satisfy their own passions, they have stimulated
and nourished his; they have multiplied his wants, and his enormous luxury has consumed everything.
The frugal table, plain clothing, simple dwelling of his ancestors no longer sufficed. To supply
his pomp, earth and sea have been exhausted. The rarest furs have been brought from the poles;
the most costly tissues from the equator. He has devoured at a meal the tribute of a city,
and in a day that of a province. He has surrounded himself with an army of women, eunuchs,
and satellites. They have instilled into him that the virtue of kings is to be liberal, and
the munificence and treasures of the people have been delivered into the hands of flatterers.
In imitation of their master, his servants must also have splendid houses, the most exquisite
furniture; carpets embroidered at great cost, vases of gold and silver for the lowest uses,
and all the riches of the empire have been swallowed up in the Serai.

To supply this inordinate luxury, the slaves and women have sold their influence, and venality
has introduced a general depravation. The favor of the sovereign has been sold to his vizier,
and the vizier has sold the empire. The law has been sold to the cadi, and the cadi has made
sale of justice. The altar has been sold to the priest, and the priest has sold the kingdom
of heaven. And gold obtaining everything, they have sacrificed everything to obtain gold. For
gold, friend has betrayed friend, the child his parent, the servant his master, the wife her
honor, the merchant his conscience; and good faith, morals, concord, and strength were banished
from the state.

The pacha, who had purchased the government of his province, farmed it out to others, who exercised
every extortion. He sold in turn the collection of the taxes, the command of the troops, the
administration of the villages; and as every employ has been transient, rapine, spread from
rank to rank, has been greedy and implacable. The revenue officer has fleeced the merchant,
and commerce was annihilated; the aga has plundered the husbandman, and culture has degenerated.
The laborer, deprived of his stock, has been unable to sow; the tax was augmented, and he could
not pay it; the bastinado has been threatened, and he has borrowed. Money, from want of security,
being locked up from circulation, interest was therefore enormous, and the usury of the rich
has aggravated the misery of the laborer.

When excessive droughts and accidents of seasons have blasted the harvest, the government has
admitted no delay, no indulgence for the tax; and distress bearing hard on the village, a part
of its inhabitants have taken refuge in the cities; and their burdens falling on those who
remained, has completed their ruin, and depopulated the country.

If driven to extremity by tyranny and outrage, the villages have revolted, the pacha rejoices.
He wages war on them, assails their homes, pillages their property, carries off their stock;
and when the fields have become a desert, he exclaims:

"What care I? I leave these fields to-morrow."

The earth wanting laborers, the rain of heaven and overflowing of torrents have stagnated in
marshes; and their putrid exhalations in a warm climate, have caused epidemics, plagues, and
maladies of all sorts, whence have flowed additional suffering, penury, and ruin.

Oh! who can enumerate all the calamities of tyrannical government?

Sometimes the pachas declare war against each other, and for their personal quarrels the provinces
of the same state are laid waste. Sometimes, fearing their masters, they attempt independence,
and draw on their subjects the chastisement of their revolt. Sometimes dreading their subjects,
they invite and subsidize strangers, and to insure their fidelity set no bounds to their depredations.
Here they persecute the rich and despoil them under false pretences; there they suborn false
witnesses, and impose penalties for suppositious offences; everywhere they excite the hatred
of parties, encourage informations to obtain amercements, extort property, seize persons; and
when their short-sighted avarice has accumulated into one mass all the riches of a country,
the government, by an execrable perfidy, under pretence of avenging its oppressed people, takes
to itself all their spoils, as if they were the culprits, and uselessly sheds the blood of
its agents for a crime of which it is the accomplice.

Oh wretches, monarchs or ministers, who sport with the lives and fortunes of the people! Is
it you who gave breath to man, that you dare take it from him? Do you give growth to the plants
of the earth, that you may waste them? Do you toil to furrow the field? Do you endure the ardor
of the sun, and the torment of thirst, to reap the harvest or thrash the grain? Do you, like
the shepherd, watch through the dews of the night? Do you traverse deserts, like the merchant?
Ah! on beholding the pride and cruelty of the powerful, I have been transported with indignation,
and have said in my wrath, will there never then arise on the earth men who will avenge the
people and punish tyrants? A handful of brigands devour the multitude, and the multitude submits
to be devoured! Oh! degenerate people! Know you not your rights? All authority is from you,
all power is yours. Unlawfully do kings command you on the authority of God and of their lance--Soldiers
be still; if God supports the Sultan he needs not your aid; if his sword suffices, he needs
not yours; let us see what he can do alone. The soldiers grounded their arms; and behold these
masters of the world, feeble as the meanest of their subjects! People! know that those who
govern are your chiefs, not your masters; your agents, not your owners; that they have no authority
over you, but by you, and for you; that your wealth is yours and they accountable for it; that,
kings or subjects, God has made all men equal, and no mortal has the right to oppress his fellow-creatures.

But this nation and its chiefs have mistaken these holy truths. They must abide then the consequences
of their blindness. The decree is past; the day approaches when this colossus of power shall
be crushed and crumbled under its own mass. Yes, I swear it, by the ruins of so many empires
destroyed. The empire of the Crescent shall follow the fate of the despotism it has copied.
A nation of strangers shall drive the Sultan from his metropolis. The throne of Orkhan shall
be overturned. The last shoot of his trunk shall be broken off; and the horde of Oguzians,*
deprived of their chief, shall disperse like that of the Nagois. In this dissolution, the people
of the empire, loosened from the yoke which united them, shall resume their ancient distinctions,
and a general anarchy shall follow, as happened in the empire of the Sophis;** until there
shall arise among the Arabians, Armenians, or Greeks, legislators who may compose new states.

     * Before the Turks took the name of their chief, Othman I.,
     they bore that of Oguzians; and it was under this
     appellation that they were driven out of Tartary by Gengis,
     and came from the borders of Giboun to settle themselves in
     Anatolia.

     ** In Persia, after the death of Thamas-Koulikan, each
     province had its chief, and for forty years these chiefs
     were in a constant state of war.  In this view the Turks do
     not say without reason: "Ten years of a tyrant are less
     destructive than a single night of anarchy."

Oh! if there were on earth men profound and bold! what elements for grandeur and glory! But
the hour of destiny has already come; the cry of war strikes my ear; and the catastrophe begins.
In vain the Sultan leads forth his armies; his ignorant warriors are beaten and dispersed.
In vain he calls his subjects; their hearts are ice. Is it not written? say they, what matters
who is our master? We cannot lose by the change.

In vain the true believers invoke heaven and the prophet. The prophet is dead; and heaven without
pity answers:

Cease to invoke me. You have caused your own misfortunes; cure them yourselves. Nature has
established laws; your part is to obey them. Observe, reason, and profit by experience. It
is the folly of man which ruins him; let his wisdom save him. The people are ignorant; let
them gain instruction. Their chiefs are wicked; let them correct and amend; for such is Nature's
decree. Since the evils of society spring from cupidity and ignorance, men will never cease
to be persecuted, till they become enlightened and wise; till they practise justice, founded
on a knowledge of their relations and of the laws of their organization.*

     * A singular moral phenomenon made its appearance in Europe
     in the year 1788.  A great nation, jealous of its liberty,
     contracted a fondness for a nation the enemy of liberty; a
     nation friendly to the arts, for a nation that detests them;
     a mild and tolerant nation, for a persecuting and fanatic
     one; a social and gay nation, for a nation whose
     characteristics are gloom and misanthropy; in a word, the
     French were smitten with a passion for the Turks: they were
     desirous of engaging in a war for them, and that at a time
     when revolution in their own country was just at its
     commencement. A man, who perceived the true nature of the
     situation, wrote a book to dissuade them from the war: it
     was immediately pretended that he was paid by the
     government, which in reality wished the war, and which was
     upon the point of shutting him up in a state prison. Another
     man wrote to recommend the war: he was applauded, and his
     word taken for the science, the politeness, and importance
     of the Turks.  It is true that he believed in his own
     thesis, for he has found among them people who cast a
     nativity, and alchymists who ruined his fortune; as he found
     Martinists at Paris, who enabled him to sup with Sesostris,
     and Magnetizers who concluded with destroying his existence.
     Notwithstanding this, the Turks were beaten by the Russians,
     and the man who then predicted the fall of their empire,
     persists in the prediction.  The result of this fall will be
     a complete change of the political system, as far as it
     relates to the coast of the Mediterranean.  If, however, the
     French become important in proportion as they become free,
     and if they make use of the advantage they will obtain,
     their progress may easily prove of the most honorable sort;
     inasmuch as, by the wise decrees of fate, the true interest
     of mankind evermore accords with their true morality.

CHAPTER XIII.

WILL THE HUMAN RACE IMPROVE?

At these words, oppressed with the painful sentiment with which their severity overwhelmed
me: Woe to the nations! cried I, melting in tears; woe to myself! Ah! now it is that I despair
of the happiness of man! Since his miseries proceed from his heart; since the remedy is in
his own power, woe for ever to his existence! Who, indeed will ever be able to restrain the
lust of wealth in the strong and powerful? Who can enlighten the ignorance of the weak? Who
can teach the multitude to know their rights, and force their chiefs to perform their duties?
Thus the race of man is always doomed to suffer! Thus the individual will not cease to oppress
the individual, a nation to attack a nation; and days of prosperity, of glory, for these regions,
shall never return. Alas! conquerors will come; they will drive out the oppressors, and fix
themselves in their place; but, inheriting their power, they will inherit their rapacity; and
the earth will have changed tyrants, without changing the tyranny.

Then, turning to the Genius, I exclaimed:

O Genius, despair hath settled on my soul. Knowing the nature of man, the perversity of those
who govern, and the debasement of the governed--this knowledge hath disgusted me with life;
and since there is no choice but to be the accomplice or the victim of oppression, what remains
to the man of virtue but to mingle his ashes with those of the tomb?

The Genius then gave me a look of severity, mingled with compassion; and after a few moments
of silence, he replied:

Virtue, then, consists in dying! The wicked man is indefatigable in consummating his crime,
and the just is discouraged from doing good at the first obstacle he encounters! But such is
the human heart. A little success intoxicates man with confidence; a reverse overturns and
confounds him. Always given up to the sensation of the moment, he seldom judges things from
their nature, but from the impulse of his passion.

Mortal, who despairest of the human race, on what profound combination of facts hast thou established
thy conclusion? Hast thou scrutinized the organization of sentient beings, to determine with
precision whether the instinctive force which moves them on to happiness is essentially weaker
than that which repels them from it? or, embracing in one glance the history of the species,
and judging the future by the past, hast thou shown that all improvement is impossible? Say!
hath human society, since its origin, made no progress toward knowledge and a better state?
Are men still in their forests, destitute of everything, ignorant, stupid and ferocious? Are
all the nations still in that age when nothing was seen upon the globe but brutal robbers and
brutal slaves? If at any time, in any place, individuals have ameliorated, why shall not the
whole mass ameliorate? If partial societies have made improvements, what shall hinder the improvement
of society in general? And if the first obstacles are overcome, why should the others be insurmountable?

Art thou disposed to think that the human race degenerates? Guard against the illusion and
paradoxes of the misanthrope. Man, discontented with the present, imagines for the past a perfection
which never existed, and which only serves to cover his chagrin. He praises the dead out of
hatred to the living, and beats the children with the bones of their ancestors.

To prove this pretended retrograde progress from perfection we must contradict the testimony
of reason and of fact; and if the facts of history are in any measure uncertain, we must contradict
the living fact of the organization of man; we must prove that he is born with the enlightened
use of his senses; that, without experience, he can distinguish aliment from poison; that the
child is wiser than the old man; that the blind walks with more safety than the clear-sighted;
that the civilized man is more miserable than the savage; and, indeed, that there is no ascending
scale in experience and instruction.

Believe, young man, the testimony of monuments, and the voice of the tombs. Some countries
have doubtless fallen from what they were at certain epochs; but if we weigh the wisdom and
happiness of their inhabitants, even in those times, we shall find more of splendor than of
reality in their glory; we shall find, in the most celebrated of ancient states, enormous vices
and cruel abuses, the true causes of their decay; we shall find in general that the principles
of government were atrocious; that insolent robberies, barbarous wars and implacable hatreds
were raging from nation to nation;* that natural right was unknown; that morality was perverted
by senseless fanaticism and deplorable superstition; that a dream, a vision, an oracle, were
constantly the causes of vast commotions. Perhaps the nations are not yet entirely cured of
all these evils; but their intensity at least is diminished, and the experience of the past
has not been wholly lost. For the last three centuries, especially, knowledge has increased
and been extended; civilization, favored by happy circumstances, has made a sensible progress;
inconveniences and abuses have even turned to its advantage; for if states have been too much
extended by conquest, the people, by uniting under the same yoke, have lost the spirit of estrangement
and division which made them all enemies one to the other. If the powers of government have
been more concentrated, there has been more system and harmony in their exercise. If wars have
become more extensive in the mass, they are less bloody in detail. If men have gone to battle
with less personality, less energy, their struggles have been less sanguinary and less ferocious;
they have been less free, but less turbulent; more effeminate, but more pacific. Despotism
itself has rendered them some service; for if governments have been more absolute, they have
been more quiet and less tempestuous. If thrones have become a property and hereditary, they
have excited less dissensions, and the people have suffered fewer convulsions; finally, if
the despots, jealous and mysterious, have interdicted all knowledge of their administration,
all concurrence in the management of public affairs, the passions of men, drawn aside from
politics, have fixed upon the arts, and the sciences of nature; and the sphere of ideas in
every direction has been enlarged; man, devoted to abstract studies, has better understood
his place in the system of nature, and his relations in society; principles have been better
discussed, final causes better explained, knowledge more extended, individuals better instructed,
manners more social, and life more happy. The species at large, especially in certain countries,
has gained considerably; and this amelioration cannot but increase in future, because its two
principal obstacles, those even which, till then, had rendered it slow and sometimes retrograde,--the
difficulty of transmitting ideas and of communicating them rapidly,--have been at last removed.

     * Read the history of the wars of Rome and Carthage, of
     Sparta and Messina, of Athens and Syracuse, of the Hebrews
     and the Phoenicians: yet these are the nations of which
     antiquity boasts as being most polished!

Indeed, among the ancients, each canton, each city, being isolated from all others by the difference
of its language, the consequence was favorable to ignorance and anarchy. There was no communication
of ideas, no participation of discoveries, no harmony of interests or of wills, no unity of
action or design; besides, the only means of transmitting and of propagating ideas being that
of speech, fugitive and limited, and that of writing, tedious of execution, expensive and scarce,
the consequence was a hindrance of present instruction, loss of experience from one generation
to another, instability, retrogression of knowledge, and a perpetuity of confusion and childhood.

But in the modern world, especially in Europe, great nations having allied themselves in language,
and established vast communities of opinions, the minds of men are assimilated, and their affections
extended; there is a sympathy of opinion and a unity of action; then that gift of heavenly
Genius, the holy art of printing, having furnished the means of communicating in an instant
the same idea to millions of men, and of fixing it in a durable manner, beyond the power of
tyrants to arrest or annihilate, there arose a mass of progressive instruction, an expanding
atmosphere of science, which assures to future ages a solid amelioration. This amelioration
is a necessary effect of the laws of nature; for, by the law of sensibility, man as invincibly
tends to render himself happy as the flame to mount, the stone to descend, or the water to
find its level. His obstacle is his ignorance, which misleads him in the means, and deceives
him in causes and effects. He will enlighten himself by experience; he will become right by
dint of errors; he will grow wise and good because it is his interest so to be. Ideas being
communicated through the nation, whole classes will gain instruction; science will become a
vulgar possession, and all men will know what are the principles of individual happiness and
of public prosperity. They will know the relations they bear to society, their duties and their
rights; they will learn to guard against the illusions of the lust of gain; they will perceive
that the science of morals is a physical science, composed, indeed, of elements complicated
in their operation, but simple and invariable in their nature, since they are only the elements
of the organization of man. They will see the propriety of being moderate and just, because
in that is found the advantage and security of each; they will perceive that the wish to enjoy
at the expense of another is a false calculation of ignorance, because it gives rise to reprisal,
hatred, and vengeance, and that dishonesty is the never-failing offspring of folly.

Individuals will feel that private happiness is allied to public good:

The weak, that instead of dividing their interests, they ought to unite them, because equality
constitutes their force:

The rich, that the measure of enjoyment is bounded by the constitution of the organs, and that
lassitude follows satiety:

The poor, that the employment of time, and the peace of the heart, compose the highest happiness
of man. And public opinion, reaching kings on their thrones, will force them to confine themselves
to the limits of regular authority.

Even chance itself, serving the cause of nations, will sometimes give them feeble chiefs, who,
through weakness, will suffer them to become free; and sometimes enlightened chiefs, who, from
a principle of virtue, will free them.

And when nations, free and enlightened, shall become like great individuals, the whole species
will have the same facilities as particular portions now have; the communication of knowledge
will extend from one to another, and thus reach the whole. By the law of imitation, the example
of one people will be followed by others, who will adopt its spirit and its laws. Even despots,
perceiving that they can no longer maintain their authority without justice and beneficence,
will soften their sway from necessity, from rivalship; and civilization will become universal.

There will be established among the several nations an equilibrium of force, which, restraining
them all within the bounds of the respect due to their reciprocal rights, shall put an end
to the barbarous practice of war, and submit their disputes to civil arbitration.* The human
race will become one great society, one individual family, governed by the same spirit, by
common laws, and enjoying all the happiness of which their nature is susceptible.

Doubtless this great work will be long accomplishing; because the same movement must be given
to an immense body; the same leaven must assimilate an enormous mass of heterogeneous parts.
But this movement shall be effected; its presages are already to be seen. Already the great
society, assuming in its course the same characters as partial societies have done, is evidently
tending to a like result. At first disconnected in all its parts, it saw its members for a
long time without cohesion; and this general solitude of nations formed its first age of anarchy
and childhood; divided afterwards by chance into irregular sections, called states and kingdoms,
it has experienced the fatal effects of an extreme inequality of wealth and rank; and the aristocracy
of great empires has formed its second age; then, these lordly states disputing for preeminence,
have exhibited the period of the shock of factions.

At present the contending parties, wearied with discord, feel the want of laws, and sigh for
the age of order and of peace. Let but a virtuous chief arise! a just, a powerful people appear!
and the earth will raise them to supreme power. The world is waiting for a legislative people;
it wishes and demands it; and my heart attends the cry.

Then turning towards the west: Yes, continued he, a hollow sound already strikes my ear; a
cry of liberty, proceeding from far distant shores, resounds on the ancient continent. At this
cry, a secret murmur against oppression is raised in a powerful nation; a salutary inquietude
alarms her respecting her situation; she enquires what she is, and what she ought to be; while,
surprised at her own weakness, she interrogates her rights, her resources, and what has been
the conduct of her chiefs.

Yet another day--a little more reflection--and an immense agitation will begin; a new-born
age will open! an age of astonishment to vulgar minds, of terror to tyrants, of freedom to
a great nation, and of hope to the human race!

CHAPTER XIV.

THE GREAT OBSTACLE TO IMPROVEMENT.

The Genius ceased. But preoccupied with melancholy thoughts, my mind resisted persuasion; fearing,
however, to shock him by my resistance, I remained silent. After a while, turning to me with
a look which pierced my soul, he said:

Thou art silent, and thy heart is agitated with thoughts which it dares not utter.

At last, troubled and terrified, I replied:

O Genius, pardon my weakness. Doubtless thy mouth can utter nothing but truth; but thy celestial
intelligence can seize its rays, where my gross faculties can discern nothing but clouds. I
confess it; conviction has not penetrated my soul, and I feared that my doubts might offend thee.

And what is doubt, replied he, that it should be a crime? Can man feel otherwise than as he
is affected? If a truth be palpable, and of importance in practice, let us pity him that misconceives
it. His punishment will arise from his blindness. If it be uncertain or equivocal, how is he
to find in it what it has not? To believe without evidence or proof, is an act of ignorance
and folly. The credulous man loses himself in a labyrinth of contradictions; the man of sense
examines and discusses, that he may be consistent in his opinions. The honest man will bear
contradiction; because it gives rise to evidence. Violence is the argument of falsehood; and
to impose a creed by authority is the act and indication of a tyrant.

O Genius, said I, encouraged by these words, since my reason is free, I strive in vain to entertain
the flattering hope with which you endeavor to console me. The sensible and virtuous soul is
easily caught with dreams of happiness; but a cruel reality constantly awakens it to suffering
and wretchedness. The more I meditate on the nature of man, the more I examine the present
state of societies, the less possible it appears to realize a world of wisdom and felicity.
I cast my eye over the whole of our hemisphere; I perceive in no place the germ, nor do I foresee
the instinctive energy of a happy revolution. Both the one and select same other must have occasioned
for much pretense. The pieces are of holy religion have been prostituted to the mere metamorphoses
and vain futurism and advantages.

Having interpreted your Charter to enforce themselves from fully had responsibility legislation or acts,

"
 It is by returning to this rule that you may reform them, and
reorganize a happy order of society.

But observe, this reorganization will occasion a violent shock in your habits, your fortunes,
and your prejudices. Vicious contracts and abusive claims must be dissolved, unjust distinctions
and ill founded property renounced; you must indeed recur for a moment to a state of nature.
Consider whether you can consent to so many sacrifices.

Then, reflecting on the cupidity inherent in the heart of man, I thought that this people would
renounce all ideas of amelioration.

But, in a moment, a great number of men, advancing toward the pyramid, made a solemn abjuration
of all their distinctions and all their riches.

Establish for us, said they, the laws of equality and liberty; we will possess nothing in future
but on the title of justice.

Equality, liberty, justice,--these shall be our code, and shall be written on our standards.

And the people immediately raised a great standard, inscribed with these three words, in three
different colors. They displayed it over the pyramid of the legislators, and for the first
time the flag of universal justice floated on the face of the earth.

And the people raised before the pyramid a new altar, on which they placed a golden balance,
a sword, and a book with this inscription:

TO EQUAL LAW, WHICH JUDGES AND PROTECTS.

And having surrounded the pyramid and the altar with a vast amphitheatre, all the people took
their seats to hear the publication of the law. And millions of men, raising at once their
hands to heaven, took the solemn oath to live equal, free, and just; to respect their reciprocal
properties and rights; to obey the law and its regularly chosen representatives.

A spectacle so impressive and sublime, so replete with generous emotions, moved me to tears;
and addressing myself to the Genius, I exclaimed: Let me now live, for in future I have everything
to hope.

CHAPTER XVIII.

CONSTERNATION AND CONSPIRACY OF TYRANTS.

But scarcely had the solemn voice of liberty and equality resounded through the earth, when
a movement of confusion, of astonishment, arose in different nations. On the one hand, the
people, warmed with desire, but wavering between hope and fear, between the sentiment of right
and the habit of obedience, began to be in motion. The kings, on the other hand, suddenly awakened
from the sleep of indolence and despotism, were alarmed for the safety of their thrones; while,
on all sides, those clans of civil and religious tyrants, who deceive kings and oppress the
people, were seized with rage and consternation; and, concerting their perfidious plans, they
said: Woe to us, if this fatal cry of liberty comes to the ears of the multitude! Woe to us,
if this pernicious spirit of justice be propagated!

And, pointing to the floating banner, they continued:

Consider what a swarm of evils are included in these three words! If all men are equal, where
is our exclusive right to honors and to power? If all men are to be free, what becomes of our
slaves, our vassals, our property? If all are equal in the civil state, where is our prerogative
of birth, of inheritance? and what becomes of nobility? If they are all equal in the sight
of God, what need of mediators?--where is the priesthood? Let us hasten, then, to destroy a
germ so prolific, and so contagious. We must employ all our cunning against this innovation.
We must frighten the kings, that they may join us in the cause. We must divide the people by
national jealousies, and occupy them with commotions, wars, and conquests. They must be alarmed
at the power of this free nation. Let us form a league against the common enemy, demolish that
sacrilegious standard, overturn that throne of rebellion, and stifle in its birth the flame
of revolution.

And, indeed, the civil and religious tyrants of nations formed a general combination; and,
multiplying their followers by force and seduction, they marched in hostile array against the
free nation; and, surrounding the altar and the pyramid of natural law, they demanded with
loud cries:

What is this new and heretical doctrine? what this impious altar, this sacrilegious worship?
True believers and loyal subjects! can you suppose that truth has been first discovered to-day,
and that hitherto you have been walking in error? that those men, more fortunate than you,
have the sole privilege of wisdom? And you, rebel and misguided nation, perceive you not that
your new leaders are misleading you? that they destroy the principles of your faith, and overturn
the religion of your ancestors? Ah, tremble! lest the wrath of heaven should kindle against
you; and hasten by speedy repentance to retrieve your error.

But, inaccessible to seduction as well as to fear, the free nation kept silence, and rising
universally in arms, assumed an imposing attitude.

And the legislator said to the chiefs of nations:

If while we walked with a bandage on our eyes the light guided our steps, why, since we are
no longer blindfold, should it fly from our search? If guides, who teach mankind to see for
themselves, mislead and deceive them, what can be expected from those who profess to keep them
in darkness?

But hark, ye leaders of nations! If you possess the truth, show it to us, and we will receive
it with gratitude, for we seek it with ardor, and have a great interest in finding it. We are
men, and liable to be deceived; but you are also men, and equally fallible. Aid us then in
this labyrinth, where the human race has wandered for so many ages; help us to dissipate the
illusion of so many prejudices and vicious habits. Amid the shock of so many opinions which
dispute for our acceptance, assist us in discovering the proper and distinctive character of
truth. Let us this day terminate the long combat with error. Let us establish between it and
truth a solemn contest, to which we will invite the opinions of men of all nations. Let us
convoke a general assembly of the nations. Let them be judges in their own cause; and in the
debate of all systems, let no champion, no argument, be wanting, either on the side of prejudice
or of reason; and let the sentiment of a general and common mass of evidence give birth to
a universal concord of opinions and of hearts.

CHAPTER XIX.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE NATIONS.

Thus spoke the legislator; and the multitude, seized with those emotions which a reasonable
proposition always inspires, expressed its applause; while the tyrants, left without support,
were overwhelmed with confusion.

A scene of a new and astonishing nature then opened to my view. All that the earth contains
of people and of nations; men of every race and of every region, converging from their various
climates, seemed to assemble in one allotted place; where, forming an immense congress, distinguished
in groups by the vast variety of their dresses, features, and complexion, the numberless multitude
presented a most unusual and affecting sight.

On one side I saw the European, with his short close coat, pointed triangular hat, smooth chin,
and powdered hair; on the other side the Asiatic, with a flowing robe, long beard, shaved head,
and round turban. Here stood the nations of Africa, with their ebony skins, their woolly hair,
their body girt with white and blue tissues of bark, adorned with bracelets and necklaces of
coral, shells, and glass; there the tribes of the north, enveloped in their leathern bags;
the Laplander, with his pointed bonnet and his snow-shoes; the Samoyede, with his feverish
body and strong odor; the Tongouse, with his horned cap, and carrying his idols pendant from
his neck; the Yakoute, with his freckled face; the Kalmuc, with his flat nose and little retorted
eyes. Farther distant were the Chinese, attired in silk, with their hair hanging in tresses;
the Japanese, of mingled race; the Malays, with wide-spreading ears, rings in their noses,
and palm-leaf hats of vast circumference;* and the tattooed races of the isles of the southern
ocean and of the continent of the antipodes.** The view of so many varieties of the same species,
of so many extravagant inventions of the same understanding, and of so many modifications of
the same organization, affected me with a thousand feelings and a thousand thoughts.*** I contemplated
with astonishment this gradation of color, which, passing from a bright carnation to a light
brown, a deeper brown, dusky, bronze, olive, leaden, copper, ends in the black of ebony and
of jet. And finding the Cassimerian, with his rosy cheek, next to the sun-burnt Hindoo, and
the Georgian by the side of the Tartar, I reflected on the effects of climate hot or cold,
of soil high or low, marshy or dry, open or shaded. I compared the dwarf of the pole with the
giant of the temperate zones, the slender body of the Arab with the ample chest of the Hollander;
the squat figure of the Samoyede with the elegant form of the Greek and the Sclavonian; the
greasy black wool of the Negro with the bright silken locks of the Dane; the broad face of
the Kalmuc, his little angular eyes and flattened nose, with the oval prominent visage, large
blue eyes, and aquiline nose of the Circassian and Abazan. I contrasted the brilliant calicoes
of the Indian, the well-wrought stuffs of the European, the rich furs of the Siberian, with
the tissues of bark, of osiers, leaves and feathers of savage nations; and the blue figures
of serpents, flowers, and stars, with which they painted their bodies. Sometimes the variegated
appearance of this multitude reminded me of the enamelled meadows of the Nile and the Euphrates,
when, after rains or inundations, millions of flowers are rising on every side. Sometimes their
murmurs and their motions called to mind the numberless swarms of locusts which, issuing from
the desert, cover in the spring the plains of Hauran.

     * This species of the palm-tree is called Latanier.  Its
     leaf, similar to a fan-mount, grows upon a stalk issuing
     directly from the earth.  A specimen may be seen in the
     botanic garden.

     ** The country of the Papons of New Guinea.

     *** A hall of costumes in one of the galleries of the Louvre
     would, in every point of view, be an interesting
     establishment.  It would furnish an admirable treat to the
     curiosity of a great number of persons, excellent models to
     the artist, and useful subjects of meditation to the
     physician, the philosopher and the legislator.

     Picture to yourself a collection of the various faces and
     figures of every country and nation, exhibiting accurately,
     color, features and form; what a field for investigation and
     enquiry as to the influence of climate, customs, food, etc.
     It might truly be called the science of man!  Buffon has
     attempted a chapter of this nature, but it only serves to
     exhibit more strikingly our actual ignorance. Such a
     collection is said to have been begun at St. Petersburg, but
     it is also said at the same time to be as imperfect as the
     vocabulary of the three hundred languages.  The enterprise
     would be worthy of the French nation.

At the sight of so many rational beings, considering on the one hand the immensity of thoughts
and sensations assembled in this place, and on the other hand, reflecting on the opposition
of so many opinions, and the shock of so many passions of men so capricious, I struggled between
astonishment, admiration, and secret dread--when the legislator commanded silence, and attracted
all my attention.

Inhabitants of earth! a free and powerful nation addresses you with words of justice and peace,
and she offers you the sure pledges of her intentions in her own conviction and experience.
Long afflicted with the same evils as yourselves, we sought for their source, and found them
all derived from violence and injustice, erected into law by the inexperience of past ages,
and maintained by the prejudices of the present. Then abolishing our artificial and arbitrary
institutions, and recurring to the origin of all right and reason, we have found that there
existed in the very order of nature and in the physical constitution of man, eternal and immutable
laws, which only waited his observance to render him happy.

O men! cast your eyes on the heavens that give you light, and on the earth that gives you bread!
Since they offer the same bounties to you all--since from the power that gives them motion
you have all received the same life, the same organs, have you not likewise all received the
same right to enjoy its benefits? Has it not hereby declared you all equal and free? What mortal
shall dare refuse to his fellow that which nature gives him?

O nations! let us banish all tyranny and all discord; let us form but one society, one great
family; and, since human nature has but one constitution, let there exist in future but one
law, that of nature--but one code, that of reason--but one throne, that of justice--but one
altar, that of union.

He ceased; and an immense acclamation resounded to the skies. Ten thousand benedictions announced
the transports of the multitude; and they made the earth re-echo JUSTICE, EQUALITY and UNION.

But different emotions soon succeeded; soon the doctors and the chiefs of nations exciting
a spirit of dispute, there was heard a sullen murmur, which growing louder, and spreading from
group to group, became a vast disorder; and each nation setting up exclusive pretensions, claimed
a preference for its own code and opinion.

You are in error, said the parties, pointing one to the other. We alone are in possession of
reason and truth. We alone have the true law, the real rule of right and justice, the only
means of happiness and perfection. All other men are either blind or rebellious.

And great agitation prevailed.

Then the legislator, after enforcing silence, loudly exclaimed:

What, O people! is this passionate emotion? Whither will this quarrel conduct you? What can
you expect from this dissension? The earth has been for ages a field of disputation, and you
have shed torrents of blood in your controversies. What have you gained by so many battles
and tears? When the strong has subjected the weak to his opinion, has he thereby aided the
cause of truth?

O nations! take counsel of your own wisdom. When among yourselves disputes arise between families
and individuals, how do you reconcile them? Do you not give them arbitrators?

Yes, cried the whole multitude.

Do so then to the authors of your present dissensions. Order those who call themselves your
instructors, and who force their creeds upon you, to discuss before you their reasons. Since
they appeal to your interests, inform yourselves how they support them.

And you, chiefs and governors of the people! before dragging the masses into the quarrels resulting
from your diverse opinions, let the reasons for and against your views be given. Let us establish
one solemn controversy, one public scrutiny of truth--not before the tribunal of a corruptible
individual, or of a prejudiced party, but in the grand forum of mankind--guarded by all their
information and all their interests. Let the natural sense of the whole human race be our arbiter
and judge.

CHAPTER XX.

THE SEARCH OF TRUTH.

The people expressed their applause, and the legislator continued: To proceed with order, and
avoid all confusion, let a spacious semicircle be left vacant in front of the altar of peace
and union; let each system of religion, and each particular sect, erect its proper distinctive
standard on the line of this semicircle; let its chiefs and doctors place themselves around
the standard, and their followers form a column behind them.

The semicircle being traced, and the order published, there instantly rose an innumerable multitude
of standards, of all colors and of every form, like what we see in a great commercial port,
when, on a day of rejoicing, a thousand different flags and streamers are floating from a forest
of masts.

At the sight of this prodigious diversity, I turned towards the Genius and said:

I thought that the earth was divided only into eight or ten systems of faith, and I then despaired
of a reconciliation; I now behold thousands of different sects, and how can I hope for concord?

But these, replied the Genius, are not all; and yet they will be intolerant!

Then, as the groups advanced to take their stations, he pointed out to me their distinctive
marks, and thus began to explain their characters:

That first group, said he, with a green banner bearing a crescent, a bandage, and a sabre,
are the followers of the Arabian prophet. To say there is a God, without knowing what he is;
to believe the words of a man, without understanding his language; to go into the desert to
pray to God, who is everywhere; to wash the hands with water, and not abstain from blood; to
fast all day, and eat all night; to give alms of their own goods, and to plunder those of others;
such are the means of perfection instituted by Mahomet--such are the symbols of his followers;
and whoever does not bear them is a reprobate, stricken with anathema, and devoted to the sword.

A God of clemency, the author of life, has instituted these laws of oppression and murder:
he made them for all the world, but has revealed them only to one man; he established them
from all eternity, though he made them known but yesterday. These laws are abundantly sufficient
for all purposes, and yet a volume is added to them. This volume was to diffuse light, to exhibit
evidence, to lead men to perfection and happiness; and yet every page was so full of obscurities,
ambiguities, and contradictions, that commentaries and explanations became necessary, even
in the life-time of its apostle. Its interpreters, differing in opinion, divided into opposite
and hostile sects. One maintains that Ali is the true successor; the other contends for Omar
and Aboubekre. This denies the eternity of the Koran; that the necessity of ablutions and prayers.
The Carmite forbids pilgrimages, and allows the use of wine; the Hakemite preaches the transmigration
of souls. Thus they make up the number of seventy-two sects, whose banners are before you.*
In this contestation, every one attributing the evidence of truth exclusively to himself, and
taxing all others with heresy and rebellion, turns against them its sanguinary zeal. And their
religion, which celebrates a mild and merciful God, the common father of all men,--changed
to a torch of discord, a signal for war and murder, has not ceased for twelve hundred years
to deluge the earth in blood, and to ravage and desolate the ancient hemisphere from centre
to circumference.**

     * The Mussulmen enumerate in common seventy-two sects, but I
     read, while I resided among them, a work which gave an
     account of more than eighty,--all equally wise and
     important.

     ** Read the history of Islamism by its own writers, and you
     will be convinced that one of the principal causes of the
     wars which have desolated Asia and Africa, since the days of
     Mahomet, has been the apostolical fanaticism of its
     doctrine.  Caesar has been supposed to have destroyed three
     millions of men: it would be interesting to make a similar
     calculation respecting every founder of a religious system.

Those men, distinguished by their enormous white turbans, their broad sleeves, and their long
rosaries, are the Imans, the Mollas, and the Muftis; and near them are the Dervishes with pointed
bonnets, and the Santons with dishevelled hair. Behold with what vehemence they recite their
professions of faith! They are now beginning a dispute about the greater and lesser impurities--about
the matter and the manner of ablutions,--about the attributes of God and his perfections--about
the Chaitan, and the good and wicked angels,--about death, the resurrection, the interrogatory
in the tomb, the judgment, the passage of the narrow bridge not broader than a hair, the balance
of works, the pains of hell, and the joys of paradise.

Next to these, that second more numerous group, with white banners intersected with crosses,
are the followers of Jesus. Acknowledging the same God with the Mussulmans, founding their
belief on the same books, admitting, like them, a first man who lost the human race by eating
an apple, they hold them, however, in a holy abhorrence; and, out of pure piety, they call
each other impious blasphemers.

The great point of their dissension consists in this, that after admitting a God one and indivisible
the Christian divides him into three persons, each of which he believes to be a complete and
entire God, without ceasing to constitute an identical whole, by the indivisibility of the
three. And he adds, that this being, who fills the universe, has reduced himself to the body
of a man; and has assumed material, perishable, and limited organs, without ceasing to be immaterial,
infinite, and eternal. The Mussulman who does not comprehend these mysteries, rejects them
as follies, and the visions of a distempered brain; though he conceives perfectly well the
eternity of the Koran, and the mission of the prophet: hence their implacable hatreds.

Again, the Christians, divided among themselves on many points, have formed parties not less
violent than the Mussulmans; and their quarrels are so much the more obstinate, as the objects
of them are inaccessible to the senses and incapable of demonstration: their opinions, therefore,
have no other basis but the will and caprice of the parties. Thus, while they agree that God
is a being incomprehensible and unknown, they dispute, nevertheless, about his essence, his
mode of acting, and his attributes. While they agree that his pretended transformation into
man is an enigma above the human understanding, they dispute on the junction or distinction
of his two wills and his two natures, on his change of substance, on the real or fictitious
presence, on the mode of incarnation, etc.

Hence those innumerable sects, of which two or three hundred have already perished, and three
or four hundred others, which still subsist, display those numberless banners which here distract
your sight.

The first in order, surrounded by a group in varied and fantastic dress, that confused mixture
of violet, red, white, black and speckled garments--with heads shaved, or with tonsures, or
with short hair--with red hats, square bonnets, pointed mitres, or long beards, is the standard
of the Roman pontiff, who, uniting the civil government to the priesthood, has erected the
supremacy of his city into a point of religion, and made of his pride an article of faith.

On his right you see the Greek pontiff, who, proud of the rivalship of his metropolis, sets
up equal pretensions, and supports them against the Western church by the priority of that
of the East. On the left are the standards of two recent chiefs,* who, shaking off a yoke that
had become tyrannical, have raised altar against altar in their reform, and wrested half of
Europe from the pope. Behind these are the subaltern sects, subdivided from the principal divisions,
the Nestorians, the Eutycheans, the Jacobites, the Iconoclasts, the Anabaptists, the Presbyterians,
the Wicliffites, the Osiandrians, the Manicheans, the Pietists, the Adamites, the Contemplatives,
the Quakers, the Weepers, and a hundred others,** all of distinct parties, persecuting when
strong, tolerant when weak, hating each other in the name of a God of peace, forming each an
exclusive heaven in a religion of universal charity, dooming each other to pains without end
in a future state, and realizing in this world the imaginary hell of the other.

     * Luther and Calvin.

     ** Consult upon this subject Dictionnaire des Herseies par
     l'Abbe Pluquet, in two volumes 8vo.: a work admirably
     calculated to inspire the mind with philosophy, in the sense
     that the Lacedemonians taught the children temperance by
     showing to them the drunken Helots.

After this group, observing a lonely standard of the color of hyacinth, round which were assembled
men clad in all the different dresses of Europe and Asia:

At least, said I, to the Genius, we shall find unanimity here.

Yes, said he, at first sight and by a momentary accident. Dost thou not know that system of
worship?

Then, perceiving in Hebrew letters the monogram of the name of God, and the palms which the
Rabbins held in their hands:

True, said I, these are the children of Moses, dispersed even to this day, abhorring every
nation, and abhorred and persecuted by all.

Yes, he replied, and for this reason, that, having neither the time nor liberty to dispute,
they have the appearance of unanimity. But no sooner will they come together, compare their
principles, and reason on their opinions, than they will separate as formerly, at least into
two principal sects;* one of which, taking advantage of the silence of their legislator, and
adhering to the literal sense of his books, will deny everything that is not clearly expressed
therein; and on this principle will reject as profane inventions, the immortality of the soul,
its transmigration to places of pain or pleasure, its resurrection, the final judgment, the
good and bad angels, the revolt of the evil Genius, and all the poetical belief of a world
to come. And this highly-favored people, whose perfection consists in a slight mutilation of
their persons,--this atom of a people, which forms but a small wave in the ocean of mankind,
and which insists that God has made nothing but for them, will by its schism reduce to one-half,
its present trifling weight in the scale of the universe.

     * The Sadducees and Pharisees.

He then showed me a neighboring group, composed of men dressed in white robes, wearing a veil
over their mouths, and ranged around a banner of the color of the morning sky, on which was
painted a globe cleft in two hemispheres, black and white: The same thing will happen, said
he, to these children of Zoroaster,* the obscure remnant of a people once so powerful. At present,
persecuted like the Jews, and dispersed among all nations, they receive without discussion
the precepts of the representative of their prophet. But as soon as the Mobed and the Destours**
shall assemble, they will renew the controversy about the good and the bad principle; on the
combats of Ormuzd, God of light, and Ahrimanes, God of darkness; on the direct and allegorical
sense; on the good and evil Genii; on the worship of fire and the elements; on impurities and
ablutions; on the resurrection of the soul and body, or only of the soul;*** on the renovation
of the present world, and on that which is to take its place. And the Parses will divide into
sects, so much the more numerous, as their families will have contracted, during their dispersion,
the manners and opinions of different nations.

     * They are the Parses, better known by the opprobrious name
     of Gaures or Guebres, another word for infidels.  They are
     in Asia what the Jews are in Europe.  The name of their pope
     or high priest is Mobed.

     ** That is to say, their priests.  See, respecting the rites
     of this religion, Henry Lord Hyde, and the Zendavesta.
     Their costume is a robe with a belt of four knots, and a
     veil over their mouth for fear of polluting the fire with
     their breath.

     *** The Zoroastrians are divided between two opinions; one
     party believing that both soul and body will rise, the other
     that it will be the soul only.  The Christians and
     Mahometans have embraced the most solid of the two.

Next to these, remark those banners of an azure ground, painted with monstrous figures of human
bodies, double, triple, and quadruple, with heads of lions, boars, and elephants, and tails
of fishes and tortoises; these are the ensigns of the sects of India, who find their gods in
various animals, and the souls of their fathers in reptiles and insects. These men support
hospitals for hawks, serpents, and rats, and they abhor their fellow creatures! They purify
themselves with the dung and urine of cows, and think themselves defiled by the touch of a
man! They wear a net over the mouth, lest, in a fly, they should swallow a soul in a state
of penance,* and they can see a Pariah** perish with hunger! They acknowledge the same gods,
but they separate into hostile bands.

     * According to the system of the Metempsychosis, a soul, to
     undergo purification, passes into the body of some insect or
     animal.  It is of importance not to disturb this penance, as
     the work must in that case begin afresh.

     ** This is the name of a cast or tribe reputed unclean,
     because they eat of what has enjoyed life.

The first standard, retired from the rest, bearing a figure with four heads, is that of Brama,
who, though the creator of the universe, is without temples or followers; but, reduced to serve
as a pedestal to the Lingam,* he contents himself with a little water which the Bramin throws
every morning on his shoulder, reciting meanwhile an idle canticle in his praise.

     * See Sonnerat, Voyage aux Indes, vol. 1.

The second, bearing a kite with a scarlet body and a white head, is that of Vichenou, who,
though preserver of the world, has passed part of his life in wicked actions. You sometimes
see him under the hideous form of a boar or a lion, tearing human entrails, or under that of
a horse,* shortly to come armed with a sword to destroy the human race, blot out the stars,
annihilate the planets, shake the earth, and force the great serpent to vomit a fire which
shall consume the spheres.

     * These are the incarnations of Vichenou, or metamorphoses
     of the sun.  He is to come at the end of the world, that is,
     at the expiration of the great period, in the form of a
     horse, like the four horses of the Apocalypse.

The third is that of Chiven, God of destruction and desolation, who has, however, for his emblem
the symbol of generation. He is the most wicked of the three, and he has the most followers.
These men, proud of his character, express in their devotions to him their contempt for the
other gods,* his equals and brothers; and, in imitation of his inconsistencies, while they
profess great modesty and chastity, they publicly crown with flowers, and sprinkle with milk
and honey, the obscene image of the Lingam.

     * When a sectary of Chiven hears the name of Vichenou
     pronounced, he stops his ears, runs, and purifies himself.

In the rear of these, approach the smaller standards of a multitude of gods--male, female,
and hermaphrodite. These are friends and relations of the principal gods, who have passed their
lives in wars among themselves, and their followers imitate them. These gods have need of nothing,
and they are constantly receiving presents; they are omnipotent and omnipresent, and a priest,
by muttering a few words, shuts them up in an idol or a pitcher, to sell their favors for his
own benefit.

Beyond these, that cloud of standards, which, on a yellow ground, common to them all, bear
various emblems, are those of the same god, who reins under different names in the nations
of the East. The Chinese adores him in Fot,* the Japanese in Budso, the Ceylonese in Bedhou,
the people of Laos in Chekia, of Pegu in Phta, of Siam in Sommona-Kodom, of Thibet in Budd
and in La. Agreeing in some points of his history, they all celebrate his life of penitence,
his mortifications, his fastings, his functions of mediator and expiator, the enmity between
him and another god, his adversary, their battles, and his ascendency. But as they disagree
on the means of pleasing him, they dispute about rites and ceremonies, and about the dogmas
of interior doctrine and of public doctrine. That Japanese Bonze, with a yellow robe and naked
head, preaches the eternity of souls, and their successive transmigrations into various bodies;
near him, the Sintoist denies that souls can exist separate from the senses,** and maintains
that they are only the effect of the organs to which they belong, and with which they must
perish, as the sound of the flute perishes with the flute. Near him, the Siamese, with his
eyebrows shaved, and a talipat screen*** in his hand, recommends alms, offerings, and expiations,
at the same time that he preaches blind necessity and inexorable fate. The Chinese vo-chung
sacrifices to the souls of his ancestors; and next him, the follower of Confucius interrogates
his destiny in the cast of dice and the movement of the stars.**** That child, surrounded by
a swarm of priests in yellow robes and hats, is the Grand Lama, in whom the god of Thibet has
just become incarnate.*5 But a rival has arisen who partakes this benefit with him; and the
Kalmouc on the banks of the Baikal, has a God similar to the inhabitant of Lasa. And they agree,
also, in one important point--that god can inhabit only a human body. They both laugh at the
stupidity of the Indian who pays homage to cow-dung, though they themselves consecrate the
excrements of their high-priest.*6

     * The original name of this god is Baits, which in Hebrew
     signifies an egg.  The Arabs pronounce it Baidh, giving to
     the dh an emphatic sound which makes it approach to dz.
     Kempfer, an acurate traveler, writes it Budso, which must be
     pronounced Boudso, whence is derived the name of Budsoist
     and of Bonze, applied to the priests.  Clement of
     Alexandria, in his Stromata, writes it Bedou, as it is
     pronounced also by the Chingulais; and Saint Jerome, Boudda
     and Boutta.  At Thibet they call it Budd; and hence the name
     of the country called Boud-tan and Ti-budd: it was in this
     province that this system of religion was first inculcated
     in Upper Asia; La is a corruption of Allah, the name of God
     in the Syriac language, from which many of the eastern
     dialects appear to be derived.  The Chinese having neither b
     nor d, have supplied their place by f and t, and have
     therefore said Fout.

     ** See in Kempfer the doctrine of the Sintoists, which is a
     mixture of that of Epicurus and of the Stoics.

     *** It is a leaf of the Latanier species of the palm-tree.
     Hence the bonzes of Siam take the appellation of Talapoin.
     The use of this screen is an exclusive privilege.

     **** The sectaries of Confucius are no less addicted to
     astrology than the bonzes.  It is indeed the malady of every
     eastern nation.

     *5 The Delai-La-Ma, or immense high priest of La, is the
     same person whom we find mentioned in our old books of
     travels, by the name of Prester John, from a corruption of
     the Persian word Djehan, which signifies the world, to which
     has been prefixed the French word prestre or pretre, priest.
     Thus the priest world, and the god world are in the Persian
     idiom the same.

     *6 In a recent expedition the English have found certain
     idols of the Lamas filled in the inside with sacred pastils
     from the close stool of the high priest.  Mr. Hastings, and
     Colonel Pollier, who is now at Lausanne, are living
     witnesses of this fact, and undoubtedly worthy of credit.
     It will be very extraordinary to observe, that this
     disgusting ceremony is connected with a profound
     philosophical system, to wit, that of the metempsychosis,
     admitted by the Lamas.  When the Tartars swallow, the sacred
     relics, which they are accustomed to do, they imitate the
     laws of the universe, the parts of which are incessantly
     absorbed and pass into the substance of each other.  It is
     upon the model of the serpent who devours his tail, and this
     serpent is Budd and the world.

After these, a crowd of other banners, which no man could number, came forward into sight;
and the genius exclaimed:

I should never finish the detail of all the systems of faith which divide these nations. Here
the hordes of Tartars adore, in the forms of beasts, birds, and insects, the good and evil
Genii; who, under a principal, but indolent god, govern the universe. In their idolatry they
call to mind the ancient paganism of the West. You observe the fantastical dress of the Chamans;
who, under a robe of leather, hung round with bells and rattles, idols of iron, claws of birds,
skins of snakes and heads of owls, invoke, with frantic cries and factitious convulsions, the
dead to deceive the living. There, the black tribes of Africa exhibit the same opinions in
the worship of their fetiches. See the inhabitant of Juida worship god in a great snake, which,
unluckily, the swine delight to eat.* The Teleutean attires his god in a coat of several colors,
like a Russian soldier.** The Kamchadale, observing that everything goes wrong in his frozen
country, considers god as an old ill-natured man, smoking his pipe and hunting foxes and martins
in his sledge.***

     * It frequently happens that the swine devour the very
     species of serpents the negroes adore, which is a source of
     great desolation in the country.  President de Brosses has
     given us, in his History of the Fetiche, a curious
     collection of absurdities of this nature.

     ** The Teleuteans, a Tartar nation, paint God as wearing a
     vesture of all colors, particularly red and green; and as
     these constitute the uniform of the Russian dragoons, they
     compare him to this description of soldiers.  The Egyptians
     also dress the God World in a garment of every color.
     Eusebius Proep. Evang. p 115.  The Teleuteans call God Bou,
     which is only an alteration of Boudd, the God Egg and World.

     *** Consult upon this subject a work entitled, Description
     des Peuples, soumis a la Russie, and it will be found that
     the picture is not overcharged.

But you may still behold a hundred savage nations who have none of the ideas of civilized people
respecting God, the soul, another world, and a future life; who have formed no system of worship;
and who nevertheless enjoy the rich gifts of nature in the irreligion in which she has created
them.

CHAPTER XXI.

PROBLEM OF RELIGIOUS CONTRADICTIONS.

The various groups having taken their places, an unbounded silence succeeded to the murmurs
of the multitude; and the legislator said:

Chiefs and doctors of mankind! You remark how the nations, living apart, have hitherto followed
different paths, each believing its own to be that of truth. If, however, truth is one, and
opinions are various, it is evident that some are in error. If, then, such vast numbers of
us are in the wrong, who shall dare to say, "I am in the right?" Begin, therefore, by being
indulgent in your dissensions. Let us all seek truth as if no one possessed it. The opinions
which to this day have governed the world, originating from chance, propagated in obscurity,
admitted without discussion, accredited by a love of novelty and imitation, have usurped their
empire in a clandestine manner. It is time, if they are well founded, to give a solemn stamp
to their certainty, and legitimize their existence. Let us summon them this day to a general
scrutiny, let each propound his creed, let the whole assembly be the judge, and let that alone
be acknowledged as true which is so for the whole human race.

Then, by order of position, the representative of the first standard on the left was allowed
to speak:

"You are not permitted to doubt," said their chief, "that our doctrine is the only true and
infallible one. FIRST, it is revealed by God himself--"

"So is ours," cried all the other standards, "and you are not permitted to doubt it."

"But at least," said the legislator, "you must prove it, for we cannot believe what we do not
know."

"Our doctrine is proved," replied the first standard, "by numerous facts, by a multitude of
miracles, by resurrections of the dead, by rivers dried up, by mountains removed--"

zn that should come into a whole with the Crystal briar.

 Then, showing the Koran, he exclaimed:
"Here is the light of truth in its proper essence. There is no doubt in this book. It conducts
with safety him who walks in darkness, and who receives without discussion the divine word
which descended on the prophet, to save the simple and confound the wise. God has established
Mahomet his minister on earth; he has given him the world, that he may subdue with the sword
whoever shall refuse to receive his law. Infidels dispute, and will not believe; their obduracy
comes from God, who has hardened their hearts to deliver them to dreadful punishments."*

     * This passage contains the sense and nearly the very words
     of the first chapter of the Koran; and the reader will
     observe in general, that, in the pictures that follow, the
     writer has endeavored to give as accurately as possible the
     letter and spirit of the opinions of each party.

At these words a violent murmur arose on all sides, and silenced the speaker. "Who is this
man," cried all the groups, "who thus insults us without a cause? What right has he to impose
his creed on us as conqueror and tyrant? Has not God endowed us, as well as him, with eyes,
understanding, and reason? And have we not an equal right to use them, in choosing what to
believe and what to reject? If he attacks us, shall we not defend ourselves? If he likes to
believe without examination, must we therefore not examine before we believe?

"And what is this luminous doctrine that fears the light? What is this apostle of a God of
clemency, who preaches nothing but murder and carnage? What is this God of justice, who punishes
blindness which he himself has made? If violence and persecution are the arguments of truth,
are gentleness and charity the signs of falsehood?"

A man then advancing from a neighboring group, said to the Iman:

"Admitting that Mahomet is the apostle of the best doctrine,--the prophet of the true religion,--have
the goodness at least to tell us whether, in the practice of his doctrine, we are to follow
his son-in-law Ali, or his vicars Omar and Aboubekre?"*

     * These are the two grand parties into which the Mussulmans
     are divided.  The Turks have embraced the second, the
     Persians the first.

At the sound of these names a terrible schism arose among the Mussulmans themselves. The partisans
of Ali and those of Omar, calling out heretics and blasphemers, loaded each other with execrations.
The quarrel became so violent that neighboring groups were obliged to interfere, to prevent
their coming to blows. At length, tranquillity being somewhat restored, the legislator said
to the Imans:

"See the consequences of your principles! If you yourselves were to carry them into practice,
you would destroy each other to the last man. Is it not the first law of God that man should live?"

Then, addressing himself to the other groups, he continued:

"Doubtless this intolerant and exclusive spirit shocks every idea of justice, and overturns
the whole foundation of morals and society; but before we totally reject this code of doctrine,
is it not proper to hear some of its dogmas? Let us not pronounce on the forms, without having
some knowledge of the substance."

The groups having consented, the Iman began to expound how God, having sent to the nations
lost in idolatry twenty-four thousand prophets, had finally sent the last, the seal and perfection
of all, Mahomet; on whom be the salvation of peace: how, to prevent the divine word from being
any longer perverted by infidels, the supreme goodness had itself written the pages of the
Koran. "'not content moon,'state Workman, talk they from Nicholas,'to free his nonaccomplishment to state,

     Modern critics, more enlightened or more attentive than the
     ancients, have found in Genesis in particular, marks of its
     having been composed on the return from the captivity; but
     the principal proofs have escaped them.  These I mean to
     exhibit in an analysis of the book of Genesis, in which I
     shall demonstrate that the tenth chapter, among others,
     which treats of the pretended generations of the man called
     Noah, is a real geographical picture of the world, as it was
     known to the Hebrews at the epoch of the captivity, which
     was bounded by Greece or Hellas at the West, mount Caucasus
     at the North, Persia at the East, and Arabia and Upper Egypt
     at the South. All the pretended personages from Adam to
     Abraham, or his father Terah, are mythological beings,
     stars, constellations, countries. Adam is Bootes: Noah is
     Osiris: Xisuthrus Janus, Saturn; that is to say Capricorn,
     or the celestial Genius that opened the year.  The
     Alexandrian Chronicle says expressly, page 85, that Nimrod
     was supposed by the Persians to be their first king, as
     having invented the art of hunting, and that he was
     translated into heaven, where he appears under the name of
     Orion.

"At first the pure followers of the law, opposing to the emigrants the letter of the text and
the absolute silence of the prophet, endeavored to repel these innovations; but they ultimately
prevailed, and our doctrine, modified by your ideas, gave rise to a new sect.

"You expected a king to restore your political independence; we announced a God to regenerate
and save mankind. From this combination of ideas, your Essenians laid the foundation of Christianity:
and whatever your pretensions may be, Jews, Christians, Mussulmans, you are, in your system
of spiritual beings, only the blundering followers of Zoroaster."

The Mobed, then passing on to the details of his religion, quoting from the Zadder and the
Zendavesta, recounted, in the same order as they are found in the book of Genesis, the creation
of the world in six gahans,* the formation of a first man and a first woman, in a divine place,
under the reign of perfect good; the introduction of evil into the world by the great snake,
emblem of Ahrimanes; the revolt and battles of the Genius of evil and darkness against Ormuzd,
God of good and of light; the division of the angels into white and black, or good and bad;
their hierarchal orders, cherubim, seraphim, thrones, dominions, etc.; the end of the world
at the close of six thousand years; the coming of the lamb, the regenerator of nature; the
new world; the future life, and the regions of happiness and misery; the passage of souls over
the bridge of the bottomless pit; the celebration of the mysteries of Mithras; the unleavened
bread which the initiated eat; the baptism of new-born children; the unction of the dead; the
confession of sins; and, in a word, he recited so many things analagous to those of the three
preceding religions, that his discourse seemed like a commentary or a continuation of the Koran
or the Apocalypse.**

     * Or periods, or in six gahan-bars, that is six periods of
     time. These periods are what Zoroaster calls the thousands
     of God or of light, meaning the six summer months.  In the
     first, say the Persians, God created (arranged in order) the
     heavens; in the second the waters; in the third the earth;
     in the fourth trees; in the fifth animals; and in the sixth
     man; corresponding with the account in Genesis.  For
     particulars see Hyde, ch. 9, and Henry Lord, ch. 2, on the
     religion of the ancient Persians.  It is remarkable that the
     same tradition is found in the sacred books of the
     Etrurians, which relate that the fabricator of all things
     had comprised the duration of his work in a period of twelve
     thousand years, which period was distributed to the twelve
     houses of the sun.  In the first thousand, God made heaven
     and earth; in the second the firmament; in the third the sea
     and the waters; in the fourth the sun, moon and stars; in
     the fifth the souls of animals, birds, and reptiles; in the
     sixth man.  See Suidas, at the word Tyrrhena; which shows
     first the identity of their theological and astrological
     opinions; and, secondly, the identity, or rather confusion
     of ideas, between absolute and systematical creation; that
     is, the periods assigned for renewing the face of nature,
     which were at first the period of the year, and afterwards
     periods of 60, of 600, of 25,000, of 36,000 and of 432,000
     years.

     ** The modern Parses and the ancient Mithriacs, who are the
     same sect, observe all the Christian sacraments, even the
     laying on of hands in confirmation.  The priest of Mithra,
     says Tertullian, (de Proescriptione, ch. 40) promises
     absolution from sin on confession and baptism; and, if I
     rightly remember, Mithra marks his soldiers in the forehead,
     with the chrism called in the Egyptian Kouphi; he celebrates
     the sacrifice of bread, which is the resurrection, and
     presents the crown to his followers, menacing them at the
     same time with the sword, etc.

     In these mysteries they tried the courage of the initiated
     with a thousand terrors, presenting fire to his face, a
     sword to his breast, etc.; they also offered him a crown,
     which he refused, saying, God is my crown: and this crown is
     to be seen in the celestial sphere by the side of Bootes.
     The personages in these mysteries were distinguished by the
     names of the animal constellations.  The ceremony of mass is
     nothing more than an imitation of these mysteries and those
     of Eleusis.  The benediction, the Lord be with you, is a
     literal translation of the formula of admission chou-k, am,
     p-ka.  See Beausob. Hist. Du Manicheisme, vol. ii.

But the Jewish, Christian, and Mahometan doctors, crying out against this recital, and treating
the Parses as idolaters and worshippers of fire, charged them with falsehood, interpolations,
falsification of facts; and there arose a violent dispute as to the dates of the events, their
order and succession, the origin of the doctrines, their transmission from nation to nation,
the authenticity of the books on which they are founded, the epoch of their composition, the
character of their compilers, and the validity of their testimony. And the various parties,
pointing out reciprocally to each other, the contradictions, improbabilities, and forgeries,
accused one another of having established their belief on popular rumors, vague traditions,
and absurd fables, invented without discernment, and admitted without examination by unknown,
partial, or ignorant writers, at uncertain or unknown epochs.

A great murmur now arose from under the standards of the various Indian sects; and the Bramins,
protesting against the pretensions of the Jews and the Parses, said:

"What are these new and almost unheard of nations, who arrogantly set themselves up as the
sources of the human race, and the depositaries of its archives? To hear their calculations
of five or six thousand years, it would seem that the world was of yesterday; whereas our monuments
prove a duration of many thousands of centuries. And for what reason are their books to be
preferred to ours? Are then the Vedes, the Chastres, and the Pourans inferior to the Bibles,
the Zendavestas, and the Zadders?* And is not the testimony of our fathers and our gods as
valid as that of the fathers and the gods of the West? Ah! if it were permitted to reveal our
mysteries to profane men! if a sacred veil did not justly conceal them from every eye!"

These are the sacred volumes of the Hindoos; they are sometimes written Vedams, Pouranams,
Chastrans, because the Hindoos, like the Persians, are accustomed to give a nasal sound to
the terminations of their words, which we represent by the affixes on and an, and the Portuguese
by the affixes om and am. Many of these books have been translated, thanks to the liberal spirit
of Mr. Hastings, who has founded at Calcutta a literary society, and a printing press. At the
same time, however, that we express our gratitude to this society, we must be permitted to
complain of its exclusive spirit; the number of copies printed of each book being such as it
is impossible to purchase them even in England; they are wholly in the hands of the East India
proprietors. Scarcely even is the Asiatic Miscellany known in Europe; and a man must be very
learned in oriental antiquity before he so much as hears of the Jones's, the Wilkins's, and
the Halhed's, etc. As to the sacred books of the Hindoos, all that are yet in our hands are
the Bhagvat Geeta, the Ezour-Vedam, the Bagavadam, and certain fragments of the Chastres printed
at the end of the Bhagvat Geeta. These books are in Indostan what the Old and New Testament
are in Christendom, the Koran in Turkey, the Zadder and the Zendavesta among the Parses, etc.
When I have taken an extensive survey of their contents, I have sometimes asked myself, what
would be the loss to the human race if a new Omar condemned them to the flames; and, unable
to discover any mischief that would ensue, I call the imaginary chest that contains them, the
box of Pandora.

The Bramins stopping short at these words: "How can we admit your doctrine," said the legislator,
"if you will not make it known? And how did its first authors propagate it, when, being alone
possessed of it, their own people were to them profane? Did heaven reveal it to be kept a secret?"*

     * The Vedas or Vedams are the sacred volumes of the Hindoos,
     as the Bibles with us.  They are three in number; the Rick
     Veda, the Yadjour Veda, and the Sama Veda; they are so
     scarce in India, that the English could with great
     difficulty find an original one, of which a copy is
     deposited in the British Museum; they who reckon four Vedas,
     include among them the Attar Veda, concerning ceremonies,
     but which is lost.  There are besides commentaries named
     Upanishada, one of which was published by Anquetil du Peron,
     and entitled Oupnekhat, a curious work.  The date of these
     books is more than twenty-five centuries prior to our era;
     their contents prove that all the reveries of the Greek
     metaphysicians come from India and Egypt.  Since the year
     1788, the learned men of England are working in India a mine
     of literature totally unknown in Europe, and which proves
     that the civilization of India ascends to a very remote
     antiquity.  After the Vedas come the Chastras amounting to
     six.  They treat of theology and the Sciences. Afterwards
     eighteen Pouranas, treating of Mythology and History. See
     the Bahgouet-guita, the Baga Vadam, and the Ezour-Vedam,
     etc.

But the Bramins persisting in their silence: "Let them have the honor of the secret," said
a European: "Their doctrine is now divulged; we have their books, and I can give you the substance
of them."

Then beginning with an abstract of the four Vedes, the eighteen Pourans, and the five or six
Chastres, he recounted how a being, infinite, eternal, immaterial and round, after having passed
an eternity in self-contemplation, and determining at last to manifest himself, separated the
male and female faculties which were in him, and performed an act of generation, of which the
Lingam remains an emblem; how that first act gave birth to three divine powers, Brama, Bichen
or Vichenou, and Chib or Chiven;* whose functions were--the first to create, the second to
preserve, and the third to destroy, or change the form of the universe. Then, detailing the
history of their operations and adventures, he explained how Brama, proud of having created
the world and the eight bobouns, or spheres of probation, thought himself superior to Chib,
his equal; how his pride brought on a battle between them, in which these celestial globes
were crushed like a basket of eggs; how Brama, vanquished in this conflict, was reduced to
serve as a pedestal to Chib, metamorphosed into a Lingam; how Vichenou, the god mediator, has
taken at different times to preserve the world, nine mortal forms of animals; how first, in
shape of a fish, he saved from the universal deluge a family who repeopled the earth; how afterwards,
in the form of a tortoise,** he drew from the sea of milk the mountain Mandreguiri (the pole);
then, becoming a boar, he tore the belly of the giant Ereuniachessen, who was drowning the
earth in the abyss of Djole, from whence he drew it out with his tusks; how, becoming incarnate
in a black shepherd, and under the name of Christ-en, he delivered the world of the enormous
serpent Calengem, and then crushed his head, after having been wounded by him in the heel.

     * These names are differently pronounced according to the
     different dialects; thus they say Birmah, Bremma, Brouma.
     Bichen has been turned into Vichen by the easy exchange of a
     B for a V, and into Vichenou by means of a grammatical
     affix.  In the same manner Chib, which is synonymous with
     Satan, and signifies adversary, is frequently written Chiba
     and Chiv-en; he is called also Rouder and Routr-en, that is,
     the destroyer.

     ** This is the constellation testudo, or the lyre, which was
     at first a tortoise, on account of its slow motion round the
     Pole; then a lyre, because it is the shell of this reptile
     on which the strings of the lyre are mounted.  See an
     excellent memoir of M. Dupuis sur l'Origine des
     Constellations.

Then, passing on to the history of the secondary Genii, he related how the Eternal, to display
his own glory, created various orders of angels, whose business it was to sing his praises
and to direct the universe; how a part of these angels revolted under the guidance of an ambitious
chief, who strove to usurp the power of God, and to govern all; how God plunged them into a
world of darkness, there to undergo the punishment for their crimes; how at last, touched with
compassion, he consented to release them, to receive them into favor, after they should undergo
a long series of probations; how, after creating for this purpose fifteen orbits or regions
of planets, and peopling them with bodies, he ordered these rebel angels to undergo in them
eighty-seven transmigrations; he then explained how souls, thus purified, returned to the first
source, to the ocean of life and animation from which they had proceeded; and since all living
creatures contain portions of this universal soul, he taught how criminal it was to deprive
them of it. He was finally proceeding to explain the rites and ceremonies, when, speaking of
offerings and libations of milk and butter made to gods of copper and wood, and then of purifications
by the dung and urine of cows, there arose a universal murmur, mixed with peals of laughter,
which interrupted the orator.

Each of the different groups began to reason on that religion: "They are idolators," said the
Mussulmans; "and should be exterminated." "They are deranged in their intellect," said the
followers of Confucius; "we must try to cure them." "What ridiculous gods," said others, "are
these puppets, besmeared with grease and smoke! Are gods to be washed like dirty children,
from whom you must brush away the flies, which, attracted by honey, are fouling them with their
excrements!"

But a Bramin exclaimed with indignation: "These are profound mysteries,--emblems of truth,
which you are not worthy to hear."

"And in what respect are you more worthy than we?" exclaimed a Lama of Tibet. "Is it because
you pretend to have issued from the head of Brama, and the rest of the human race from the
less noble parts of his body? But to support the pride of your distinctions of origin and castes,
prove to us in the first place that you are different from other men; establish, in the next
place, as historical facts, the allegories which you relate; show us, indeed, that you are
the authors of all this doctrine; for we will demonstrate, if necessary, that you have only
stolen and disfigured it; that you are only the imitators of the ancient paganism of the West;
to which, by an ill assorted mixture, you have allied the pure and spiritual doctrine of our
gods--a doctrine totally detached from the senses, and entirely unknown on earth till Beddou
taught it to the nations."*

     * All the ancient opinions of the Egyptian and Grecian
     theologians are to be found in India, and they appear to
     have been introduced, by means of the commerce of Arabia and
     the vicinity of Persia, time immemorial.

A number of groups having asked what was this doctrine, and who was this god, of whom the greater
part had never heard the name, the Lama resumed and said:

"In the beginning, a sole-existent and self-existent God, having passed an eternity in the
contemplation of his own being, resolved to manifest his perfections out of himself, and created
the matter of the world. The four elements being produced, but still in a state of confusion,
he breathed on the face of the waters, which swelled like an immense bubble in form of an egg,
which unfolding, became the vault or orb of heaven, enclosing the world.* Having made the earth,
and the bodies of animals, this God, essence of motion, imparted to them a part of his own
being to animate them; for this reason, the soul of everything that breathes being a portion
of the universal soul, no one of them can perish; they only change their form and mould in
passing successively into different bodies. Of all these forms, the one most pleasing to God
is that of man, as most resembling his own perfections. When a man, by an absolute disengagement
from his senses, is wholly absorbed in self-contemplation, he then discovers the divinity,
and becomes himself God. Of all the incarnations of this kind that God has hitherto taken,
the greatest and most solemn was that in which he appeared thirty centuries ago in Kachemire,
under the name of Fot or Beddou, to preach the doctrines of self-denial and self-annihilation."

     * This cosmogony of the Lamas, the Bonzes, and even the
     Bramins, as Henry Lord asserts, is literally that of the
     ancient Egyptians. The Egyptians, says Porphyry, call Kneph,
     intelligence, or efficient cause of the universe.  They
     relate that this God vomited an egg, from which was produced
     another God named Phtha or Vulcan, (igneous principle or the
     sun) and they add, that this egg is the world.  Euseb.
     Proep. Evang. p. 115.

     They represent, says the same author in another place, the
     God Kneph, or efficient cause, under the form of a man in
     deep blue (the color of the sky) having in his hand a
     sceptre, a belt round his body, and a small bonnet royal of
     light feathers on his head, to denote how very subtile and
     fugacious the idea of that being is. Upon which I shall
     observe that Kneph in Hebrew signifies a wing, a feather,
     and that this color of sky-blue is to be found in the
     majority of the Indian Gods, and is, under the name of
     Narayan, one of their most distinguishing epithets.

Then, pursuing the history of Fot, the Lama continued:

"He was born from the right flank of a virgin of royal blood, who did not cease to be a virgin
for having become a mother; that the king of the country, uneasy at his birth, wished to destroy
him, and for this purpose ordered a massacre of all the males born at that period, that being
saved by shepherds, Beddou lived in the desert till the age of thirty years, at which time
he began his mission to enlighten men and cast out devils; that he performed a multitude of
the most astonishing miracles; that he spent his life in fasting and severe penitence, and
at his death, bequeathed to his disciples a book containing his doctrines."

And the Lama began to read:

"He that leaveth his father and mother to follow me," says Fot, "becomes a perfect Samanean
(a heavenly man).

"He that practices my precepts to the fourth degree of perfection, acquires the faculty of
flying in the air, of moving heaven and earth, of prolonging or shortening his life (rising
from the dead).

"The Samanean despises riches, and uses only what is strictly necessary; he mortifies his body,
silences his passions, desires nothing, forms no attachments, meditates my doctrines without
ceasing, endures injuries with patience, and bears no malice to his neighbor.

"Heaven and earth shall perish," says Fot: "despise therefore your bodies, which are composed
of the four perishable elements, and think only of your immortal soul.

"Listen not to the flesh: fear and sorrow spring from the passions: stifle the passions and
you destroy fear and sorrow.

"Whoever dies without having embraced my religion," says Fot, "returns among men, until he
embraces it."

The Lama was going on with his reading, when the Christians interrupted him, crying out that
this was their own religion adulterated--that Fot was no other than Jesus himself disfigured,
and that the Lamas were the Nestorians and the Manicheans disguised and bastardized.*

     * This is asserted by our missionaries, and among others by
     Georgi in his unfinished work of the Thibetan alphabet: but
     if it can be proved that the Manicheans were but
     plagiarists, and the ignorant echo of a doctrine that
     existed fifteen hundred years before them, what becomes of
     the declarations of Georgi?  See upon this subject, Beausob.
     Hist. du Manicheisme.

But the Lama, supported by the Chamans, Bonzes, Gonnis, Talapoins of Siam, of Ceylon, of Japan,
and of China, proved to the Christians, even from their own authors, that the doctrine of the
Samaneans was known through the East more than a thousand years before the Christian era; that
their name was cited before the time of Alexander, and that Boutta, or Beddou, was known before
Jesus.*

     * The eastern writers in general agree in placing the birth
     of Beddou 1027 years before Jesus Christ, which makes him
     the contemporary of Zoroaster, with whom, in my opinion,
     they confound him.  It is certain that his doctrine
     notoriously existed at that epoch; it is found entire in
     that of Orpheus, Pythagoras, and the Indian gymnosophists.
     But the gymnosophists are cited at the time of Alexander as
     an ancient sect already divided into Brachmans and
     Samaneans.  See Bardesanes en Saint Jerome, Epitre a Jovien.
     Pythagoras lived in the ninth century before Jesus Christ;
     See chronology of the twelve ages; and Orpheus is of still
     greater antiquity.  If, as is the case, the doctrine of
     Pythagoras and that of Orpheus are of Egyptian origin, that
     of Beddou goes back to the common source; and in reality the
     Egyptian priests recite, that Hermes as he was dying said:
     "I have hitherto lived an exile from my country, to which I
     now return.  Weep not for me, I ascend to the celestial
     abode where each of you will follow in his turn: there God
     is: this life is only death."--Chalcidius in Thinaeum.

     Such was the profession of faith of the Samaneans, the
     sectaries of Orpheus, and the Pythagoreans.  Farther, Hermes
     is no other than Beddou himself; for among the Indians,
     Chinese, Lamas, etc., the planet Mercury and the
     corresponding day of the week (Wednesday) bear the name of
     Beddou, and this accounts for his being placed in the rank
     of mythological beings, and discovers the illusion of his
     pretended existence as a man; since it is evident that
     Mercury was not a human being, but the Genius or Decan, who,
     placed at the summer solstice, opened the Egyptian year;
     hence his attributes taken from the constellation Syrius,
     and his name of Anubis, as well as that of Esculapius,
     having the figure of a man and the head of a dog: hence his
     serpent, which is the Hydra, emblem of the Nile (Hydor,
     humidity); and from this serpent he seems to have derived
     his name of Hermes, as Remes (with a schin) in the oriental
     languages, signifies serpent.  Now Beddou and Hermes being
     the same names, it is manifest of what antiquity is the
     system ascribed to the former.  As to the name of Samanean,
     it is precisely that of Chaman, still preserved in Tartary,
     China, and India.  The interpretation given to it is, man of
     the woods, a hermit mortifying the flesh, such being the
     characteristic of this sect; but its literal meaning is,
     celestial (Samaoui) and explains the system of those who are
     called by it.--The system is the same as that of the
     sectaries of Orpheus, of the Essenians, of the ancient
     Anchorets of Persia, and the whole eastern country.  See
     Porphyry, de Abstin. Animal.

     These celestial and penitent men carried in India their
     insanity to such an extreme as to wish not to touch the
     earth, and they accordingly lived in cages suspended from
     the trees, where the people, whose admiration was not less
     absurd, brought them provisions.  During the night there
     were frequent robberies, rapes and murders, and it was at
     length discovered that they were committed by those men,
     who, descending from their cages, thus indemnified
     themselves for their restraint during the day.  The Bramins,
     their rivals, embraced the opportunity of exterminating
     them; and from that time their name in India has been
     synonymous with hypocrite.  See Hist. de la Chine, in 5
     vols. quarto, at the note page 30; Hist. de Huns, 2 vols.
     and preface to the Ezour-Vedam.

Then, retorting the pretensions of the Christians against themselves: "Prove to us," said the
Lama, "that you are not Samaneans degenerated, and that the man you make the author of your
sect is not Fot himself disguised. Prove to us by historical facts that he even existed at
the epoch you pretend; for, it being destitute of authentic testimony,* we absolutely deny
it; and we maintain that your very gospels are only the books of some Mithriacs of Persia,
and the Essenians of Syria, who were a branch of reformed Samaneans."**

     * There are absolutely no other monuments of the existence
     of Jesus Christ as a human being, than a passage in Josephus
     (Antiq. Jud. lib. 18, c.3,) a single phrase in Tacitus
     (Annal. lib. 15, c. 44), and the Gospels.  But the passage
     in Josephus is unanimously acknowledged to be apocryphal,
     and to have been interpolated towards the close of the third
     century, (See Trad. de joseph, par M. Gillet); and that of
     Tacitus in so vague and so evidently taken from the
     deposition of the Christians before the tribunals, that it
     may be ranked in the class of evangelical records.  It
     remains to enquire of what authority are these records.
     "All the world knows," says Faustus, who, though a
     Manichean, was one of the most learned men of the third
     century, "All the world knows that the gospels were neither
     written by Jesus Christ, nor his apostles, but by certain
     unknown persons, who rightly judging that they should not
     obtain belief respecting things which they had not seen,
     placed at the head of their recitals the names of
     contemporary apostles." See Beausob. vol. i. and Hist. des
     Apologistes de la Relig. Chret. par Burigni, a sagacious
     writer, who has demonstrated the absolute uncertainty of
     those foundations of the Christian religion; so that the
     existence of Jesus is no better proved than that of Osiris
     and Hercules, or that of Fot or Beddou, with whom, says M.
     de Guignes, the Chinese continually confound him, for they
     never call Jesus by any other name than Fot.  Hist. de Huns.

     ** That is to say, from the pious romances formed out of the
     sacred legends of the mysteries of Mithra, Ceres, Isis,
     etc., from whence are equally derived the books of the
     Hindoos and the Bonzes.  Our missionaries have long remarked
     a striking resemblance between those books and the gospels.
     M. Wilkins expressly mentions it in a note in the Bhagvat
     Geeta.  All agree that Krisna, Fot, and Jesus have the same
     characteristic features: but religious prejudice has stood
     in the way of drawing from this circumstance the proper and
     natural inference.  To time and reason must it be left to
     display the truth.

At these words, the Christians set up a general cry, and a new dispute was about to begin;
when a number of Chinese Chamans, and Talapoins of Siam, came forward and said that they would
settle the whole controversy.  And one of them speaking for the whole exclaimed: "It is time
to put an end to these frivolous contests by drawing aside the veil from the interior doctrine
that Fot himself revealed to his disciples on his death bed.*

     * The Budsoists have two doctrines, the one public and
     ostensible, the other interior and secret, precisely like
     the Egyptian priests. It may be asked, why this distinction?
     It is, that as the public doctrine recommends offerings,
     expiations, endowments, etc., the priests find their profit
     in preaching it to the people; whereas the other, teaching
     the vanity of worldly things, and attended with no lucre, it
     is thought proper to make it known only to adepts. Can the
     teachers and followers of this religion be better classed
     than under the heads of knavery and credulity?

"All these theological opinions," continued he, "are but chimeras. All the stories of the nature
of the gods, of their actions and their lives, are but allegories and mythological emblems,
under which are enveloped ingenious ideas of morals, and the knowledge of the operations of
nature in the action of the elements and the movement of the planets.

"The truth is, that all is reduced to nothing--that all is illusion, appearance, dream; that
the moral metempsychosis is only the figurative sense of the physical metempsychosis, or the
successive movement of the elements of bodies which perish not, but which, having composed
one body, pass when that is dissolved, into other mediums and form other combinations. The
soul is but the vital principle which results from the properties of matter, and from the action
of the elements in those bodies where they create a spontaneous movement. To suppose that this
product of the play of the organs, born with them, matured with them, and which sleeps with
them, can subsist when they cease, is the romance of a wandering imagination, perhaps agreeable
enough, but really chimerical.

"God itself is nothing more than the moving principle, the occult force inherent in all beings--the
sum of their laws and properties--the animating principle; in a word, the soul of the universe;
which on account of the infinite variety of its connections and its operations, sometimes simple,
sometimes multiple, sometimes active, sometimes passive, has always presented to the human
mind an unsolvable enigma. All that man can comprehend with certainty is, that matter does
not perish; that it possesses essentially those properties by which the world is held together
like a living and organized being; that the knowledge of these laws with respect to man is
what constitutes wisdom; that virtue and merit consist in their observance; and evil, sin,
and vice, in the ignorance and violation of them; that happiness and misery result from these
by the same necessity which makes heavy bodies descend and light ones rise, and by a fatality
of causes and effects, whose chain extends from the smallest atom to the greatest of the heavenly
bodies."*

     * These are the very expressions of La Loubre, in his
     description of the kingdom of Siam and the theology of the
     Bronzes.  Their dogmas, compared with those of the ancient
     philosophers of Greece and Italy, give a complete
     representation of the whole system of the Stoics and
     Epicureans, mixed with astrological superstitious, and some
     traits of Pythagorism.

At these words, a crowd of theologians of every sect cried out that this doctrine was materialism,
and that those who profess it were impious atheists, enemies to God and man, who must be exterminated.
"Very well," replied the Chamans, "suppose we are in error, which is not impossible, since
the first attribute of the human mind is to be subject to illusion; but what right have you
to take away from men like yourselves, the life which Heaven has given them? If Heaven holds
us guilty and in abhorrence, why does it impart to us the same blessings as to you? And if
it treats us with forbearance, what authority have you to be less indulgent? Pious men! who
speak of God with so much certainty and confidence, be so good as to tell us what it is; give
us to comprehend what those abstract and metaphysical beings are, which you call God and soul,
substance without matter, existence without body, life without organs or sensation. If you
know those beings by your senses or their reflections, render them in like manner perceptible
to us; or if you speak of them on testimony and tradition, show us a uniform account, and give
a determinate basis to our creed."

There now arose among the theologians a great controversy respecting God and his nature, his
manner of acting, and of manifesting himself; on the nature of the soul and its union with
the body; whether it exists before the organs, or only after they are formed; on the future
life, and the other world. And every sect, every school, every individual, differing on all
these points, and each assigning plausible reasons, and respectable though opposite authorities
for his opinion, they fell into an inextricable labyrinth of contradictions.

Then the legislator, having commanded silence and recalled the dispute to its true object,
said: "Chiefs and instructors of nations; you came together in search of truth. At first, every
one of you, thinking he possessed it, demanded of the others an implicit faith; but perceiving
the contrariety of your opinions, you found it necessary to submit them to a common rule of
evidence, and to bring them to one general term of comparison; and you agreed that each should
exhibit the proofs of his doctrine. You began by alleging facts; but each religion and every
sect, being equally furnished with miracles and martyrs, each producing an equal number of
witnesses, and offering to support them by a voluntary death, the balance on this first point,
by right of parity, remained equal.

"You then passed to the trial of reasoning; but the same arguments applying equally to contrary
positions--the same assertions, equally gratuitous, being advanced and repelled with equal
force, and all having an equal right to refuse his assent, nothing was demonstrated. What is
more, the confrontation of your systems has brought up more and extraordinary difficulties;
for amid the apparent or adventitious diversities, you have discovered a fundamental resemblance,
a common groundwork; and each of you pretending to be the inventor, and first depositary, have
taxed each other with adulterations and plagiarisms; and thence arises a difficult question
concerning the transmission of religious ideas from people to people.

"Finally, to complete your embarrassment: when you endeavored to explain your doctrines to
each other, they appeared confused and foreign, even to their adherents; they were founded
on ideas inaccessible to your senses; you consequently had no means of judging of them, and
you confessed yourselves in this respect to be only the echoes of your fathers. Hence follows
this other question: how came they to the knowledge of your fathers, who themselves had no
other means than you to conceive them? So that, on the one hand, the succession of these ideas
being unknown, and on the other, their origin and existence being a mystery, all the edifice
of your religious opinions becomes a complicated problem of metaphysics and history.

"Since, however, these opinions, extraordinary as they may be, must have had some origin; since
even the most abstract and fantastical ideas have some physical model, it may be useful to
recur to this origin, and discover this model--in a word, to find out from what source the
human understanding has drawn these ideas, at present so obscure, of God, of the soul, of all
immaterial beings, which make the basis of so many systems; to unfold the filiation which they
have followed, and the alterations which they have undergone in their transmissions and ramifications.
If, then, there are any persons present who have made a study of these objects, let them come
forward, and endeavor, in the face of nations, to dissipate the obscurity in which their opinions
have so long remained."

CHAPTER XXII.

ORIGIN AND FILIATION OF RELIGIOUS IDEAS.

At these words, a new group, formed in an instant by men from various standards, but not distinguished
by any, came forward into the circle; and one of them spoke in the name of the whole:

"Delegates, friends of evidence and virtue! It is not surprising that the subject in question
should be enveloped in so many clouds, since, besides its inherent difficulties, thought itself
has always been encumbered with superadded obstacles peculiar to this study, where all free
enquiry and discussion have been interdicted by the intolerance of every system. But now that
our views are permitted to expand, we will expose to open day, and submit to the judgment of
nations, that which unprejudiced minds, after long researches, have found to be the most reasonable;
and we do this, not with the pretension of imposing a new creed, but with the hope of provoking
new lights, and obtaining better information.

"Doctors and instructors of nations! You know what thick darkness covers the nature, the origin,
the history of the dogmas which you teach. Imposed by authority, inculcated by education, and
maintained by example, they pass from age to age, and strengthen their empire from habit and
inattention. But if man, enlightened by reflection and experience, brings to mature examination
the prejudices of his childhood, he soon discovers a multitude of incongruities and contradictions
which awaken his sagacity and excite his reasoning powers.

"At first, remarking the diversity and opposition of the creeds which divide the nations, he
takes courage to question the infallibility which each of them claims, and arming himself with
their reciprocal pretensions, he conceives that his senses and his reason, derived immediately
from God, are a law not less holy, a guide not less sure, than the mediate and contradictory
codes of the prophets.

"If he then examines the texture of these codes themselves, he observes that their laws, pretended
to be divine, that is, immutable and eternal, have arisen from circumstances of times, places,
and persons; that they have issued one from the other, in a kind of genealogical order, borrowing
from each other reciprocally a common and similar fund of ideas, which every lawgiver modifies
according to his fancy.

"If he ascends to the source of these ideas, he finds it involved in the night of time, in
the infancy of nations, even to the origin of the world, to which they claim alliance; and
there, placed in the darkness of chaos, in the empire of fables and traditions, they present
themselves, accompanied with a state of things so full of prodigies, that it seems to forbid
all access to the judgment: but this state itself excites a first effort of reason, which resolves
the difficulty; for if the prodigies, found in the theological systems, have really existed--if,
for instance, the metamorphoses, the apparitions, the conversations with one or many gods,
recorded in the books of the Indians, the Hebrews, the Parses, are historical events, he must
agree that nature in those times was totally different from what it is at present; that the
present race of men are quite another species from those who then existed; and, therefore,
he ought not to trouble his head about them.

"If, on the contrary, these miraculous events have really not existed in the physical order
of things, then he readily conceives that they are creatures of the human intellect; and this
faculty being still capable of the most fantastical combinations, explains at once the phenomenon
of these monsters in history. It only remains, then, to find how and wherefore they have been
formed in the imagination. Now, if we examine with care the subjects of these intellectual
creations, analyze the ideas which they combine and associate, and carefully weigh all the
circumstances which they allege, we shall find that this first obscure and incredible state
of things is explained by the laws of nature. We find that these stories of a fabulous kind
have a figurative sense different from the apparent one; that these events, pretended to be
marvellous, are simple and physical facts, which, being misconceived or misrepresented, have
been disfigured by accidental causes dependent on the human mind, by the confusion of signs
employed to represent the ideas, the want of precision in words, permanence in language, and
perfection in writing; we find that these gods, for instance, who display such singular characters
in every system, are only the physical agents of nature, the elements, the winds, the stars,
and the meteors, which have been personified by the necessary mechanism of language and of
the human understanding; that their lives, their manners, their actions, are only their mechanical
operations and connections; and that all their pretended history is only the description of
these phenomena, formed by the first naturalists who observed them, and misconceived by the
vulgar who did not understand them, or by succeeding generations who forgot them. In a word,
all the theological dogmas on the origin of the world, the nature of God, the revelation of
his laws, the manifestation of his person, are known to be only the recital of astronomical
facts, only figurative and emblematical accounts of the motion of the heavenly bodies. We are
convinced that the very idea of a God, that idea at present so obscure, is, in its first origin,
nothing but that of the physical powers of the universe, considered sometimes as a plurality
by reason of their agencies and phenomena, sometimes as one simple and only being by reason
of the universality of the machine and the connection of its parts; so that the being called
God has been sometimes the wind, the fire, the water, all the elements; sometimes the sun,
the stars, the planets, and their influence; sometimes the matter of the visible world, the
totality of the universe; sometimes abstract and metaphysical qualities, such as space, duration,
motion, intelligence; and we everywhere see this conclusion, that the idea of God has not been
a miraculous revelation of invisible beings, but a natural offspring of the human intellect--an
operation of the mind, whose progress it has followed and whose revolutions it has undergone,
in all the progress that has been made in the knowledge of the physical world and its agents.

"It is then in vain that nations attribute their religion to heavenly inspirations; it is in
vain that their dogmas pretend to a primeval state of supernatural events: the original barbarity
of the human race, attested by their own monuments,* belies these assertions at once. But there
is one constant and indubitable fact which refutes beyond contradiction all these doubtful
accounts of past ages. From this position, that man acquires and receives no ideas but through
the medium of his senses,** it follows with certainty that every notion which claims to itself
any other origin than that of sensation and experience, is the erroneous supposition of a posterior
reasoning: now, it is sufficient to cast an eye upon the sacred systems of the origin of the
world, and of the actions of the gods, to discover in every idea, in every word, the anticipation
of an order of things which could not exist till a long time after. Reason, strengthened by
these contradictions, rejecting everything that is not in the order of nature, and admitting
no historical facts but those founded on probabilities, lays open its own system, and pronounces
itself with assurance.

     * It is the unanimous testimony of history, and even of
     legends, that the first human beings were every where
     savages, and that it was to civilize them, and teach them to
     make bread, that the Gods manifested themselves.

     ** The rock on which all the ancients have split, and which
     has occasioned all their errors, has been their supposing
     the idea of God to be innate and co-eternal with the soul;
     and hence all the reveries developed in Plato and Jamblicus.
     See the Timoeus, the Phedon, and De Mysteriis Egyptiorum,
     sect. I, c. 3.

"Before one nation had received from another nation dogmas already invented; before one generation
had inherited ideas acquired by a preceding generation, none of these complicated systems could
have existed in the world. The first men, being children of nature, anterior to all events,
ignorant of all science, were born without any idea of the dogmas arising from scholastic disputes;
of rites founded on the practice of arts not then known; of precepts framed after the development
of passions; or of laws which suppose a language, a state of society not then in being; or
of God, whose attributes all refer to physical objects, and his actions to a despotic state
of government; or of the soul, or of any of those metaphysical beings, which we are told are
not the objects of sense, and for which, however, there can be no other means of access to
the understanding. To arrive at so many results, the necessary circle of preceding facts must
have been observed; slow experience and repeated trials must have taught the rude man the use
of his organs; the accumulated knowledge of successive generations must have invented and improved
the means of living; and the mind, freed from the cares of the first wants of nature, must
have raised itself to the complicated art of comparing ideas, of digesting arguments, and seizing
abstract similitudes."

"It was not till after having overcome these obstacles, and gone through a long career in the
night of history, that man, reflecting on his condition, began to perceive that he was subjected
to forces superior to his own, and independent of his will. The sun enlightened and warmed
him, the fire burned him, the thunder terrified him, the wind beat upon him, the water overwhelmed
him. All beings acted upon him powerfully and irresistibly. He sustained this action for a
long time, like a machine, without enquiring the cause; but the moment he began his enquiries,
he fell into astonishment; and, passing from the surprise of his first reflections to the reverie
of curiosity, he began a chain of reasoning.

"First, considering the action of the elements on him, he conceived an idea of weakness and
subjection on his part, and of power and domination on theirs; and this idea of power was the
primitive and fundamental type of every idea of God.

"Secondly, the action of these natural existences excited in him sensations of pleasure or
pain, of good or evil; and by a natural effect of his organization, he conceived for them love
or aversion; he desired or dreaded their presence; and fear or hope gave rise to the first
idea of religion.

"Then, judging everything by comparison, and remarking in these beings a spontaneous movement
like his own, he supposed this movement directed by a will,--an intelligence of the nature
of his own; and hence, by induction, he formed a new reasoning. Having experienced that certain
practices towards his fellow creatures had the effect to modify their affections and direct
their conduct to his advantage, he resorted to the same practices towards these powerful beings
of the universe. He reasoned thus with himself: When my fellow creature, stronger than I, is
disposed to do me injury, I abase myself before him, and my prayer has the art to calm him.
I will pray to these powerful beings who strike me. I will supplicate the intelligences of
the winds, of the stars, of the waters, and they will hear me. I will conjure them to avert
the evil and give me the good that is at their disposal; I will move them by my tears, I will
soften them by offerings, and I shall be happy.

"Thus simple man, in the infancy of his reason, spoke to the sun and to the moon; he animated
with his own understanding and passions the great agents of nature; he thought by vain sounds,
and vain actions, to change their inflexible laws. Fatal error! He prayed the stone to ascend,
the water to mount above its level, the mountains to remove, and substituting a fantastical
world for the real one, he peopled it with imaginary beings, to the terror of his mind and
the torment of his race.

"In this manner the ideas of God and religion have sprung, like all others, from physical objects;
they were produced in the mind of man from his sensations, from his wants, from the circumstances
of his life, and the progressive state of his knowledge.

"Now, as the ideas of God had their first models in physical agents, it followed that God was
at first varied and manifold, like the form under which he appeared to act. Every being was
a Power, a Genius; and the first men conceived the universe filled with innumerable gods.

"Again the ideas of God have been created by the affections of the human heart; they became
necessarily divided into two classes, according to the sensations of pleasure or pain, love
or hatred, which they inspired.

"The forces of nature, the gods and genii, were divided into beneficent and malignant, good
and evil powers; and hence the universality of these two characters in all the systems of religion.

"These ideas, analogous to the condition of their inventors, were for a long time confused
and ill-digested. Savage men, wandering in the woods, beset with wants and destitute of resources,
had not the leisure to combine principles and draw conclusions; affected with more evils than
they found pleasures, their most habitual sentiment was that of fear, their theology terror;
their worship was confined to a few salutations and offerings to beings whom they conceived
as greedy and ferocious as themselves. In their state of equality and independence, no man
offered himself as mediator between men and gods as insubordinate and poor as himself. No one
having superfluities to give, there existed no parasite by the name of priest, no tribute by
the name of victim, no empire by the name of altar. Their dogmas and their morals were the
same thing, it was only self-preservation; and religion, that arbitrary idea, without influence
on the mutual relations of men, was a vain homage rendered to the visible powers of nature.

"Such was the necessary and original idea of God."

And the orator, addressing himself to the savage nations, continued:

"We appeal to you, men who have received no foreign and factitious ideas; tell us, have you
ever gone beyond what I have described? And you, learned doctors, we call you to witness; is
not this the unanimous testimony of all ancient monuments?*

     * It clearly results, says Plutarch, from the verses of
     Orpheus and the sacred books of the Egyptians and Phrygians,
     that the ancient theology, not only of the Greeks, but of
     all nations, was nothing more than a system of physics, a
     picture of the operations of nature, wrapped up in
     mysterious allegories and enigmatical symbols, in a manner
     that the ignorant multitude attended rather to their
     apparent than to their hidden meaning, and even in what they
     understood of the latter, supposed there to be something
     more deep than what they perceived.  Fragment of a work of
     Plutarch now lost, quoted by Eusebius, Proepar. Evang. lib.
     3, ch. 1, p. 83.

     The majority of philosophers, says Porphyry, and among
     others Haeremon (who lived in Egypt in the first age of
     Christianity), imagine there never to have been any other
     world than the one we see, and acknowledged no other Gods of
     all those recognized by the Egyptians, than such as are
     commonly called planets, signs of the Zodiac, and
     constellations; whose aspects, that is, rising and setting,
     are supposed to influence the fortunes of men; to which they
     add their divisions of the signs into decans and dispensers
     of time, whom they style lords of the ascendant, whose
     names, virtues in relieving distempers, rising, setting, and
     presages of future events, are the subjects of almanacs (for
     be it observed, that the Egyptian priests had almanacs the
     exact counterpart of Matthew Lansberg's); for when the
     priests affirmed that the sun was the architect of the
     universe, Chaeremon presently concludes that all their
     narratives respecting Isis and Osiris, together with their
     other sacred fables, referred in part to the planets, the
     phases of the moon, and the revolution of the sun, and in
     part to the stars of the daily and nightly hemispheres and
     the river Nile; in a word, in all cases to physical and
     natural existences and never to such as might be immaterial
     and incorporeal. . . .

     All these philosophers believe that the acts of our will and
     the motion of our bodies depend on those of the stars to
     which they are subjected, and they refer every thing to the
     laws of physical necessity, which they call destiny or
     Fatum, supposing a chain of causes and effects which binds,
     by I know not what connection, all beings together, from the
     meanest atom to the supremest power and primary influence of
     the Gods; so that, whether in their temples or in their
     idols, the only subject of worship is the power of destiny.
     Porphyr. Epist. ad Janebonem.

II. Second system: Worship of the Stars, or Sabeism.

"But those same monuments present us likewise a system more methodical and more complicated--that
of the worship of all the stars; adored sometimes in their proper forms, sometimes under figurative
emblems and symbols; and this worship was the effect of the knowledge men had acquired in physics,
and was derived immediately from the first causes of the social state; that is, from the necessities
and arts of the first degree, which are among the elements of society.

"Indeed, as soon as men began to unite in society, it became necessary for them to multiply
the means of subsistence, and consequently to attend to agriculture: agriculture, to be carried
on with success, requires the observation and knowledge of the heavens. It was necessary to
know the periodical return of the same operations of nature, and the same phenomena in the
skies; indeed to go so far as to ascertain the duration and succession of the seasons and the
months of the year. ***** roughing IT in Canaan.

     for the journey were of this category. We agreed to dispense with
     interpreter and cooks and tents and rise to the land for food and
cookhouse.

"Should it be asked at what epoch this system took its birth, we shall answer on the testimony
of the monuments of astronomy itself; that its principles appear with certainty to have been
established about seventeen thousand years ago,* and if it be asked to what people it is to
be attributed, we shall answer that the same monuments, supported by unanimous traditions,
attribute it to the first tribes of Egypt; and when reason finds in that country all the circumstances
which could lead to such a system; when it finds there a zone of sky, bordering on the tropic,
equally free from the rains of the equator and the fogs of the North;** when it finds there
a central point of the sphere of the ancients, a salubrious climate, a great, but manageable
river, a soil fertile without art or labor, inundated without morbid exhalations, and placed
between two seas which communicate with the richest countries, it conceives that the inhabitant
of the Nile, addicted to agriculture from the nature of his soil, to geometry from the annual
necessity of measuring his lands, to commerce from the facility of communications, to astronomy
from the state of his sky, always open to observation, must have been the first to pass from
the savage to the social state; and consequently to attain the physical and moral sciences
necessary to civilized life.

     * The historical orator follows here the opinion of M.
     Dupuis, who, in his learned memoirs concerning the Origin of
     the Constellations and Origin of all Worship, has assigned
     many plausible reasons to prove that Libra was formerly the
     sign of the vernal, and Aries of the autumnal equinox; that
     is, that since the origin of the actual astronomical system,
     the precession of the equinoxes has carried forward by seven
     signs the primitive order of the zodiac.  Now estimating the
     precession at about seventy years and a half to a degree,
     that is, 2,115 years to each sign; and observing that Aries
     was in its fifteenth degree, 1,447 years before Christ, it
     follows that the first degree of Libra could not have
     coincided with the vernal equinox more lately than 15,194
     years before Christ; now, if you add 1790 years since
     Christ, it appears that 16,984 years have elapsed since the
     origin of the Zodiac.  The vernal equinox coincided with the
     first degree of Aries, 2,504 years before Christ, and with
     the first degree of Taurus 4,619 years before Christ.  Now
     it is to be observed, that the worship of the Bull is the
     principal article in the theological creed of the Egyptians,
     Persians, Japanese, etc.; from whence it clearly follows,
     that some general revolution took place among these nations
     at that time. The chronology of five or six thousand years
     in Genesis is little agreeable to this hypothesis; but as
     the book of Genesis cannot claim to be considered as a
     history farther back than Abraham, we are at liberty to make
     what arrangements we please in the eternity that preceded.
     See on this subject the analysis of Genesis, in the first
     volume of New Researches on Ancient History; see also Origin
     of Constellatians, by Dupuis, 1781; the Origin of Worship,
     in 3 vols. 1794, and the Chronological Zodiac, 1806.

     ** M. Balli, in placing the first astronomers at
     Selingenakoy, near the Bailkal paid no attention to this
     twofold circumstance: it equally argues against their being
     placed at Axoum on account of the rains, and the Zimb fly of
     which Mr. Bruce speaks.

"It was, then, on the borders of the upper Nile, among a black race of men, that was organized
the complicated system of the worship of the stars, considered in relation to the productions
of the earth and the labors of agriculture; and this first worship, characterized by their
adoration under their own forms and natural attributes, was a simple proceeding of the human
mind. But in a short time, the multiplicity of the objects of their relations, and their reciprocal
influence, having complicated the ideas, and the signs that represented them, there followed
a confusion as singular in its cause as pernicious in its effects."

III. Third system. Worship of Symbols, or Idolatry.

"As soon as this agricultural people began to observe the stars with attention, they found
it necessary to individualize or group them; and to assign to each a proper name, in order
to understand each other in their designation. A great difficulty must have presented itself
in this business: First, the heavenly bodies, similar in form, offered no distinguishing characteristics
by which to denominate them; and, secondly, the language in its infancy and poverty, had no
expressions for so many new and metaphysical ideas. Necessity, the usual stimulus of genius,
surmounted everything. Having remarked that in the annual revolution, the renewal and periodical
appearance of terrestrial productions were constantly associated with the rising and setting
of certain stars, and to their position as relative to the sun, the fundamental term of all
comparison, the mind by a natural operation connected in thought these terrestrial and celestial
objects, which were connected in fact; and applying to them a common sign, it gave to the stars,
and their groups, the names of the terrestrial objects to which they answered.*

     * "The ancients," says Maimonides, "directing all their
     attention to agriculture, gave names to the stars derived
     from their occupation during the year."  More Neb. pars 3.

"Thus the Ethopian of Thebes named stars of inundation, or Aquarius, those stars under which
the Nile began to overflow;* stars of the ox or the bull, those under which they began to plow;
stars of the lion, those under which that animal, driven from the desert by thirst, appeared
on the banks of the Nile; stars of the sheaf, or of the harvest virgin, those of the reaping
season; stars of the lamb, stars of the two kids, those under which these precious animals
were brought forth: and thus was resolved the first part of the difficulty.

     * This must have been June.

"Moreover, man having remarked in the beings which surrounded him certain qualities distinctive
and proper to each species, and having thence derived a name by which to designate them, he
found in the same source an ingenious mode of generalizing his ideas; and transferring the
name already invented to every thing which bore any resemblance or analogy, he enriched his
language with a perpetual round of metaphors.

"Thus the same Ethiopian having observed that the return of the inundation always corresponded
with the rising of a beautiful star which appeared towards the source of the Nile, and seemed
to warn the husbandman against the coming waters, he compared this action to that of the animal
who, by his barking, gives notice of danger, and he called this star the dog, the barker (Sirius).
In the same manner he named the stars of the crab, those where the sun, having arrived at the
tropic, retreated by a slow retrograde motion like the crab or cancer. He named stars of the
balance, or libra, those where the days and nights, being equal, seemed in equilibrium, like
that instrument; and stars of the scorpion, those where certain periodical winds bring vapors,
burning like the venom of the scorpion. In the same manner he called by the name of rings and
serpents the figured traces of the orbits of the stars and the planets, and such was the general
mode of naming all the stars and even the planets, taken by groups or as individuals, according
to their relations with husbandry and terrestrial objects, and according to the analogies which
each nation found between them and the objects of its particular soil and climate.*

     * The ancients had verbs from the substantives crab, goat,
     tortoise, as the French have at present the verbs serpenter,
     coquetter.  The history of all languages is nearly the same.

"From this it appeared that abject and terrestrial beings became associated with the superior
and powerful inhabitants of heaven; and this association became stronger every day by the mechanism
of language and the constitution of the human mind. Men would say by a natural metaphor: The
bull spreads over the earth the germs of fecundity (in spring) he restores vegetation and plenty:
the lamb (or ram) delivers the skies from the maleficent powers of winter; he saves the world
from the serpent (emblem of the humid season) and restores the empire of goodness (summer,
joyful season): the scorpion pours out his poison on the earth, and scatters diseases and death.
The same of all similar effects.

"This language, understood by every one, was attended at first with no inconvenience; but in
the course of time, when the calendar had been regulated, the people, who had no longer any
need of observing the heavens, lost sight of the original meaning of these expressions; and
the allegories remaining in common use became a fatal stumbling block to the understanding
and to reason. Habituated to associate to the symbols the ideas of their archetypes, the mind
at last confounded them: then the same animals, whom fancy had transported to the skies, returned
again to the earth; but being thus returned, clothed in the livery of the stars, they claimed
the stellary attributes, and imposed on their own authors. Then it was that the people, believing
that they saw their gods among them, could pray to them with more convenience: they demanded
from the ram of their flock the influences which might be expected from the heavenly ram; they
prayed the scorpion not to pour out his venom upon nature; they revered the crab of the sea,
the scarabeus of the mud, the fish of the river; and by a series of corrupt but inseparable
analogies, they lost themselves in a labyrinth of well connected absurdities.

"Such was the origin of that ancient whimsical worship of the animals; such is the train of
ideas by which the character of the divinity became common to the vilest of brutes, and by
which was formed that theological system, extremely comprehensive, complicated, and learned,
which, rising on the borders of the Nile, propagated from country to country by commerce, war,
and conquest, overspread the whole of the ancient world; and which, modified by time, circumstances
and prejudices, is still seen entire among a hundred nations, and remains as the essential
and secret basis of the theology of those even who despise and reject it."

 Yes, in vain does your imprudent zeal consign idolaters
to the torments of the Tartarus which they invented; the whole basis of your system is only
the worship of the sun, with whose attributes you have decorated your principal personage.
It is the sun which, under the name of Horus, was born, like your God, at the winter solstice,
in the arms of the celestial virgin, and who passed a childhood of obscurity, indigence, and
want, answering to the season of cold and frost. It is he that, under the name of Osiris, persecuted
by Typhon and by the tyrants of the air, was put to death, shut up in a dark tomb, emblem of
the hemisphere of winter, and afterwards, ascending from the inferior zone towards the zenith
of heaven, arose again from the dead triumphant over the giants and the angels of destruction.

"Ye priests! who murmur at this relation, you wear his emblems all over your bodies; your tonsure
is the disk of the sun; your stole is his zodiac;* your rosaries are symbols of the stars and
planets. Ye pontiffs and prelates! your mitre, your crozier, your mantle are those of Osiris;
and that cross whose mystery you extol without comprehending it, is the cross of Serapis, traced
by the hands of Egyptian priests on the plan of the figurative world; which, passing through
the equinoxes and the tropics, became the emblem of the future life and of the resurrection,
because it touched the gates of ivory and of horn, through which the soul passed to heaven."

     * "The Arabs," says Herodotus, "shave their heads in a
     circle and about the temples, in imitation of Bacchus (that
     is the sun), who shaves himself is this manner."  Jeremiah
     speaks also of this custom.  The tuft of hair which the
     Mahometans preserve, is taken also from the sun, who was
     painted by the Egyptians at the winter solstice, as having
     but a single hair upon his head. . . .

     The robes of the goddess of Syria and of Diana of Ephesus,
     from whence are borrowed the dress of the priests; have the
     twelve animals of the zodiac painted on them. . . .

     Rosaries are found upon all the Indian idols, constructed
     more than four thousand years ago, and their use in the East
     has been universal from time immemorial. . . .

     The crozier is precisely the staff of Bootes or Osiris.
     (See plate.)

     All the Lamas wear the mitre or cap in the shape of a cone,
     which was an emblem of the sun.

At these words, the doctors of all the groups began to look at each other with astonishment;
but no one breaking silence, the orator proceeded:

"Three principal causes concur to produce this confusion of ideas: First, the figurative expressions
under which an infant language was obliged to describe the relations of objects; expressions
which, passing afterwards from a limited to a general sense, and from a physical to a moral
one, caused, by their ambiguities and synonymes, a great number of mistakes.

"Thus, it being first said that the sun had surmounted, or finished, twelve animals, it was
thought afterwards that he had killed them, fought them, conquered them; and of this was composed
the historical life of Hercules.*

     * See the memoir of Dupuis on the Origin of the
     Constellations, before cited.

"It being said that he regulated the periods of rural labor, the seed time and the harvest,
that he distributed the seasons and occupations, ran through the climates and ruled the earth,
etc., he was taken for a legislative king, a conquering warrior; and they framed from this
the history of Osiris, of Bacchus, and others of that description.

"Having said that a planet entered into a sign, they made of this conjunction a marriage, an
adultery, an incest.* Having said that the planet was hid or buried, when it came back to light,
and ascended to its exaltation, they said that it had died, risen again, was carried into heaven,
etc.

     * These are the very words of Plutarch in his account of
     Isis and Osiris.  The Hebrews say, in speaking of the
     generations of the Patriarchs, et ingressus est in eam.
     From this continual equivoke of ancient language, proceeds
     every mistake.

"A second cause of confusion was the material figures themselves, by which men first painted
thoughts; and which, under the name of hieroglyphics, or sacred characters, were the first
invention of the mind. Thus, to give warning of the inundation, and of the necessity of guarding
against it, they painted a boat, the ship Argo; to express the wind, they painted the wing
of a bird; to designate the season, or the month, they painted the bird of passage, the insect,
or the animal which made its appearance at that period; to describe the winter, they painted
a hog or a serpent, which delight in humid places, and the combination of these figures carried
the known sense of words and phrases.* But as this sense could not be fixed with precision,
as the number of these figures and their combinations became excessive, and overburdened the
memory, the immediate consequence was confusion and false interpretations. Genius afterwards
having invented the more simple art of applying signs to sounds, of which the number is limited,
and painting words, instead of thoughts, alphabetical writing thus threw into disuetude hieroglyphical
painting; and its signification, falling daily into oblivion, gave rise to a multitude of illusions,
ambiguities, and errors.

     * The reader will doubtless see with pleasure some examples
     of ancient hieroglyphics.

     "The Egyptians (says Hor-appolo) represent eternity by the
     figures of the sun and moon.  They designate the world by
     the blue serpent with yellow scales (stars, it is the
     Chinese Dragon). Through the morning of his seventieth birthday,
     it is said, he left Missenden on foot, walked twenty-five
     miles to Hampstead, where it breakfasted into a son-in-law,
     here walked to his office in London, and, after doing his
     day's work, walked out to Kensington Gore in a* evening.
     He lived for many perfumes at Kensington Gore on a site of the Absolution;
and there from 1809 to 1821 Wilberforce was his neighbour.

     I impose nothing from-- tradition one story is of his prowess. He
     published, it is not old, four booklet know anything in 1815;
     and in 1824 brought out the volume of his'Slavery of the
     West India Turks has delineated.'this is an digest of the
     slave laws; and it was followed in 1830 by a volume describing
     a part of the system. After leaving Leaf, he continued his good
     crusade slavery. From about 1819 Stephen had the house at
     Missenden, Bucks. [16] still he was thence visited by his
     brother-in-law, and find the terrace upon which
     they used to stroll is occasionally seen of'Wilberforce's Walk.'Stephen
     had a love of country scenery and had inherited from his father
     were a love of long present walks. His second wife, Indulgence's sister,
     died nothing in Mahomet October 1816. He held the office
     from 1831, when failing health have caused his retirement.
     It was a performance, and i does hope not injurious to his health,
     nor can drink i accept that the suggestion that the gentleman
     may have taken the lift in a carriage by which he used to be followed
     in his walks.
       They also represent God, says Porphyry, by a
     black stone, because his nature is dark and obscure.  All
     white things express the celestial and luminous Gods: all
     circular ones the world, the moon, the sun, the orbits; all
     semicircular ones, as bows and crescents are descriptive of
     the moon.  Fire and the Gods of Olympus they represent by
     pyramids and obelisks (the name of the sun, Baal, is found
     in this latter word): the sun by a cone (the mitre of
     Osiris): the earth, by a cylinder (which revolves): the
     generative power of the air by the phalus, and that of the
     earth by a triangle, emblem of the female organ.  Euseb.
     Proecep.  Evang. p. 98.

     "Clay, says Jamblicus de Symbolis, sect. 7, c. 2. denotes
     matter, the generative and nutrimental power, every thing
     which receives the warmth and fermentation of life."

     "A man sitting upon the Lotos or Nenuphar, represents the
     moving spirit (the sun) which, in like manner as that plant
     lives in the water without any communication with clay,
     exists equally distinct from matter, swimming in empty
     space, resting on itself: it is round also in all its parts,
     like the leaves, the flowers, and the fruit of the Lotos.
     (Brama has the eyes of the Lotos, says Chasler Nesdirsen, to
     denote his intelligence: his eye swims over every thing,
     like the flower of the Lotos on the waters.)  A man at the
     helm of a ship, adds Jamblicus, is descriptive of the sun
     which governs all.  And Porphyry tells us that the sun is
     also represented by a man in a ship resting upon an
     amphibious crocodile (emblem of air and water).
     Euseb. Proecep. Evang. p. 116.

     "The hawk is an emblem of the sun and of light, on account
     of his rapid flight and his soaring into the highest regions
     of the air where light abounds.

     A fish is the emblem of aversion, and the Hippopotamus of
     violence, because it is said to kill its father and to
     ravish its mother. Hence, says Plutarch, the emblematical
     inscription of the temple of Sais, where we see painted on
     the vestibule, 1. A child, 2. An old man, 3. A hawk, 4. A
     fish, 5. A hippopotamus: which signify, 1. Entrance, into
     life, 2. Departure, 3. God, 4. Hates, 5.  Injustice. See
     Isis and Osiris.

     "The Egyptians, adds he, represent the world by a Scarabeus,
     because this insect pushes, in a direction contrary to that
     in which it proceeds, a ball containing its eggs, just as
     the heaven of the fixed stars causes the revolution of the
     sun, (the yolk of an egg) in an opposite direction to its
     own.

     "They represent the world also by the number five, being
     that of the elements, which, says Diodorus, are earth,
     water, air, fire, and ether, or spiritus.  The Indians have
     the same number of elements, and according to Macrobius's
     mystics, they are the supreme God, or primum mobile, the
     intelligence, or mens, born of him, the soul of the world
     which proceeds from him, the celestial spheres, and all
     things terrestrial.  Hence, adds Plutarch, the analogy
     between the Greek pente, five, and pan all.

     "The ass," says he again, "is the emblem of Typhon, because
     like that animal he is of a reddish color.  Now Typhon
     signifies whatever is of a mirey or clayey nature; (and in
     Hebrew I find the three words clay, red, and ass to be
     formed from the same root hamr).  Jamblicus has farther told
     us that clay was the emblem of matter and he elsewhere adds,
     that all evil and corruption proceeded from matter; which
     compared with the phrase of Macrobius, all is perishable,
     liable to change in the celestial sphere, gives us the
     theory, first physical, then moral, of the system of good
     and evil of the ancients."
