PREFACE.

Mr. Theodore Irving, in his valuable history of the "Conquest of Florida," speaking of the
astonishing achievements of the Spanish Cavaliers, in the dawn of the sixteenth century says:

     "Of all the enterprises undertaken in this spirit of daring
     adventure, none has surpassed, for hardihood and variety of
     incident, that of the renowned Hernando de Soto, and his
     band of cavaliers. It was poetry put in action. It was the
     knight-errantry of the old world carried into the depths of
     the American wilderness. Indeed the personal adventures, the
     feats of individual prowess, the picturesque description of
     steel-clad cavaliers, with lance and helm and prancing
     steed, glittering through the wildernesses of Florida,
     Georgia, Alabama, and the prairies of the Far West, would
     seem to us mere fictions of romance, did they not come to us
     recorded in matter of fact narratives of contemporaries, and
     corroborated by minute and daily memoranda of
     eye-witnesses."

These are the wild and wondrous adventures which I wish here to record. I have spared no pains
in obtaining the most accurate information which the records of those days have transmitted
to us. It is as wrong to traduce the dead as the living. If one should be careful not to write
a line which dying he would wish to blot, he should also endeavor to write of the departed
in so candid and paternal a spirit, while severely just to the truth of history, as to be safe
from reproach. One who is aiding to form public opinion respecting another, who has left the
world, should remember that he may yet meet the departed in the spirit land. And he may perhaps
be greeted with the words, "Your condemnation was too severe. You did not make due allowance
for the times in which I lived. You have held up my name to unmerited reproach."

Careful investigation has revealed De Soto to me as by no means so bad a man as I had supposed
him to have been. And I think that the candid reader will admit that there was much, in his
heroic but melancholy career, which calls for charitable construction and sympathy.

The authorities upon which I have mainly relied for my statements, are given in the body of
the work. There is no country on the globe, whose early history is so full of interest and
instruction as our own. The writer feels grateful to the press, in general, for the kindly
spirit in which it has spoken of the attempt, in this series, to interest the popular reader
in those remarkable incidents which have led to the establishment of this majestic republic.

CHAPTER I.

Childhood and Youth.

In the interior of Spain, about one hundred and thirty miles southwest of Madrid, there is
the small walled town of Xeres. It is remote from all great routes of travel, and contains
about nine thousand inhabitants, living very frugally, and in a state of primitive simplicity.
There are several rude castles of the ancient nobility here, and numerous gloomy, monastic
institutions. In one of these dilapidated castles, there was born, in the year 1500, a boy,
who received the name of Ferdinand de Soto. His parents were Spanish nobles, perhaps the most
haughty class of nobility which has ever existed. It was, however, a decayed family, so impoverished
as to find it difficult to maintain the position of gentility. The parents were not able to
give their son a liberal education. Their rank did not allow them to introduce him to any of
the pursuits of industry; and so far as can now be learned, the years of his early youth were
spent in idleness.

Ferdinand was an unusually handsome boy. He grew up tall, well formed, and with remarkable
muscular strength and agility. He greatly excelled in fencing, horseback riding, and all those
manly exercises which were then deemed far more essential for a Spanish gentleman than literary
culture. He was fearless, energetic, self-reliant; and it was manifest that he was endowed
with mental powers of much native strength.

When quite a lad he attracted the attention of a wealthy Spanish nobleman, Don Pedro de Avila,
who sent him to one of the Spanish universities, probably that of Saragossa, and maintained
him there for six years. Literary culture was not then in high repute; but it was deemed a
matter of very great moment that a nobleman of Spain should excel in horsemanship, in fencing,
and in wielding every weapon of attack or defence.

Ferdinand became quite renowned for his lofty bearing, and for all chivalric accomplishments.
At the tournaments, and similar displays of martial prowess then in vogue, he was prominent,
exciting the envy of competitive cavaliers, and winning the admiration of the ladies.

Don Pedro became very proud of his foster son, received him to his family, and treated him
as though he were his own child. The Spanish court had at that time established a very important
colony at the province of Darien, on the Isthmus of Panama. This isthmus, connecting North
and South America, is about three hundred miles long and from forty to sixty broad. A stupendous
range of mountains runs along its centre, apparently reared as an eternal barrier between the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans. From several of the summits of this ridge the waters of the two
oceans can at the same time be distinctly seen. Here the Spanish court, in pursuit of its energetic
but cruel conquest of America, had established one of its most merciless colonies. There was
gold among the mountains. The natives had many golden ornaments. They had no conception of
the value of the precious ore in civilized lands. Readily they would exchange quite large masses
of gold for a few glass beads. The great object of the Spaniards in the conquest of Darien
was to obtain gold. They inferred that if the ignorant natives, without any acquaintance with
the arts, had obtained so much, there must be immense quantities which careful searching and
skilful mining would reveal.

The wanton cruelties practised by the Spaniards upon the unoffending natives of these climes
seem to have been as senseless as they were fiendlike. It is often difficult to find any motive
for their atrocities. These crimes are thoroughly authenticated, and yet they often seem like
the outbursts of demoniac malignity. Anything like a faithful recital of them would torture
the sensibilities of our readers almost beyond endurance. Mothers and maidens were hunted and
torn down by bloodhounds; infant children were cut in pieces, and their quivering limbs thrown
to the famished dogs.

The large wealth and the rank of Don Pedro de Avila gave him much influence at the Spanish
court. He succeeded in obtaining the much-coveted appointment of Governor of Darien. His authority
was virtually absolute over the property, the liberty, and the lives of a realm, whose extended
limits were not distinctly defined.

Don Pedro occupied quite an imposing castle, his ancestral mansion, in the vicinity of Badajoz.
Here the poor boy Ferdinand, though descended from families of the highest rank, was an entire
dependent upon his benefactor. The haughty Don Pedro treated him kindly. Still he regarded
him, in consequence of his poverty, almost as a favored menial. He fed him, clothed him, patronized
him.

It was in the year 1514 that Don Pedro entered upon his office of Governor of Darien. The insatiate
thirst for gold caused crowds to flock to his banners. A large fleet was soon equipped, and
more than two thousand persons embarked at St. Lucar for the golden land. The most of these
were soldiers; men of sensuality, ferocity, and thirst for plunder. Not a few noblemen joined
the enterprise; some to add to their already vast possessions, and others hoping to retrieve
their impoverished fortunes.

A considerable number of priests accompanied the expedition, and it is very certain that some
of these at least were actuated by a sincere desire to do good to the natives, and to win them
to the religion of Jesus:--that religion which demands that we should do to others as we would
that others should do to us, and whose principles, the governor, the nobles, and the soldiers,
were ruthlessly trampling beneath their feet. Don Pedro, when measured by the standard of Christianity,
was proud, perfidious and tyrannical. The course he pursued upon his arrival in the country
was impolitic and almost insane.

His predecessor in the governorship was Vasco Nuñez. He had been on the whole a prudent, able
and comparatively merciful governor. He had entered into trade with the natives, and had so
far secured their good will as to induce them to bring in an ample supply of provisions for
his colony. He had sent out Indian explorers, with careful instructions to search the gold
regions among the mountains. Don Pedro, upon assuming the reins of government, became very
jealous of the popularity of Nuñez, whom he supplanted. His enmity soon became so implacable
that, without any cause, he accused him of treason and ordered him to be decapitated. The sentence
was executed in the public square of Acla. Don Pedro himself gazed on the cruel spectacle concealed
in a neighboring house. He seemed ashamed to meet the reproachful eye of his victim, as with
an axe his head was cut off upon a block.

All friendly relations with the Indians were speedily terminated. They were robbed of their
gold, of their provisions, and their persons were outraged in the most cruel manner. The natives,
terror-stricken, fled from the vicinity of the colony, and suddenly the Spaniards found all
their supplies of provisions cut off. More than two thousand were crowded into a narrow space
on the shores of the gulf, with no possibility of obtaining food. They were entirely unprepared
for any farming operations, having neither agricultural tools nor seed. Neither if they had
them could they wait for the slow advent of the harvest. Famine commenced its reign, and with
famine, its invariable attendant, pestilence. In less than six months, of all the glittering
hosts, which with music and banners had landed upon the isthmus, expecting soon to return to
Europe with their ships freighted with gold, but a few hundred were found alive, and they were
haggard and in rags.

The Spaniards had robbed the Indians of their golden trinkets, but these trinkets could not
be eaten and they would purchase no food. They were as worthless as pebbles picked from the
beach. Often lumps of gold, or jewels of inestimable value, were offered by one starving wretch
to another for a piece of mouldy bread. The colony would have become entirely extinct, but
for the opportune arrival of vessels from Spain with provisions. Don Pedro had sent out one
or two expeditions of half-famished men to seize the rice, Indian corn, and other food, wherever
such food could be found.

The natives had sufficient intelligence to perceive that the colonists were fast wasting away.
The Indians were gentle and amiable in character, and naturally timid; with no taste for the
ferocities of war. But emboldened by the miseries of the colonies, and beginning to despise
their weakness, they fell upon the foraging parties with great courage and drove them back
ignominiously to the coast. The arrival of the ships to which we have referred with provisions
and reinforcements, alone saved the colony from utter extinction.

Don Pedro, after having been in the colony five years, returned to Spain to obtain new acquisitions
of strength in men and means for the prosecution of ever-enlarging plans of wealth and ambition.
North and south of the narrow peninsula were the two majestic continents of North and South
America. They both invited incursions, where nations could be overthrown, empires established,
fame won, and where mountains of gold might yet be found.

It seems that De Soto had made the castle of Don Pedro, near Badajoz, his home during the absence
of the governor. There all his wants had been provided for through the charitable munificence
of his patron. He probably had spent his term time at the university. He was now nineteen years
of age, and seemed to have attained the full maturity of his physical system, and had developed
into a remarkably elegant young man.

The family of Don Pedro had apparently remained at the castle. His second daughter, Isabella,
was a very beautiful girl in her sixteenth year. She had already been presented at the resplendent
court of Spain, where she had attracted great admiration. Rich, beautiful and of illustrious
birth, many noblemen had sought her hand, and among the rest, one of the princes of the blood
royal. But Isabella and De Soto, much thrown together in the paternal castle, had very naturally
fallen in love with each other.

The haughty governor was one day exceedingly astounded and enraged, that De Soto had the audacity
to solicit the hand of his daughter in marriage. In the most contemptuous and resentful manner,
he repelled the proposition as an insult. De Soto was keenly wounded. He was himself a man
of noble birth. He had no superior among all the young noblemen around him, in any chivalric
accomplishment. The only thing wanting was money. Don Pedro loved his daughter, was proud of
her beauty and celebrity, and was fully aware that she had a very decided will of her own.

After the lapse of a few days, the governor was not a little alarmed by a statement, which
the governess of the young lady ventured to make to him. She assured him that Isabella had
given her whole heart to De Soto, and that she had declared it to be her unalterable resolve
to retire to a convent, rather than to become the wife of any other person. Don Pedro was almost
frantic with rage. As totally devoid of moral principle as he was of human feelings, he took
measures to have De Soto assassinated. Such is the uncontradicted testimony of contemporary
historians. But every day revealed to him more clearly the strength of Isabella's attachment
for De Soto, and the inflexibility of her will. He became seriously alarmed, not only from
the apprehension that if her wishes were thwarted, no earthly power could prevent her from
burying herself in a convent, but he even feared that if De Soto were to be assassinated, she
would, by self-sacrifice, follow him to the world of spirits. This caused him to feign partial
reconciliation, and to revolve in his mind more cautious plans for his removal.

He decided to take De Soto back with him to Darien. The historians of those days represent
that it was his intention to expose his young protégé to such perils in wild adventures in
the New World, as would almost certainly secure his death. De Soto himself, proud though poor,
was tortured by the contemptuous treatment which he received, even from the menials in the
castle, who were aware of his rejection by their proud lord. He therefore eagerly availed himself
of the invitation of Don Pedro to join in a new expedition which he was fitting out for Darien.

He resolved, at whatever sacrifice, to be rich. The acquisition of gold, and the accumulation
of fame, became the great objects of his idolatry. With these he could not only again claim
the hand of Isabella, but the haughty Don Pedro would eagerly seek the alliance of a man of
wealth and renown. Thousands of adventurers were then crowding to the shores of the New World,
lured by the accounts of the boundless wealth which it was said could there be found, and inspired
by the passion which then pervaded Christendom, of obtaining celebrity by the performance of
chivalric deeds.

Many had returned greatly enriched by the plunder of provinces. The names of Pizarro and Cortez
had been borne on the wings of renown through all the countries of Europe, exciting in all
honorable minds disgust, in view of their perfidy and cruelty, and inspiring others with emotions
of admiration, in contemplation of their heroic adventures.

De Soto was greatly embarrassed by his poverty. Both his parents were dead. He was friendless;
and it was quite impossible for him to provide himself with an outfit suitable to the condition
of a Spanish grandee. The insulting treatment he had received from Don Pedro rendered it impossible
for him to approach that haughty man as a suppliant for aid. But Don Pedro did not dare to
leave De Soto behind him. The family were to remain in the ancestral home. And it was very
certain that, Don Pedro being absent, ere long he would hear of the elopement of Ferdinand
and Isabella. Thus influenced, he offered De Soto a free passage to Darien, a captain's commission
with a suitable outfit, and pledged himself that he should have ample opportunity of acquiring
wealth and distinction, in an expedition he was even then organizing for the conquest of Peru.
As Don Pedro made these overtures to the young man, with apparently the greatest cordiality,
assuming that De Soto, by embarking in the all-important enterprise, would confer a favor rather
than receive one, the offer was eagerly accepted.

Don Pedro did everything in his power to prevent the two lovers from having any private interview
before the expedition sailed. But the ingenuity of love as usual triumphed over that of avarice.
Isabella and De Soto met, and solemnly pledged constancy to each other. It seems that Isabella
thoroughly understood the character of her father, and knew that he would shrink from no crime
in the accomplishment of his purposes. As she took her final leave of her lover, she said to
him, very solemnly and impressively,

"Ferdinand, remember that one treacherous friend is more dangerous than a thousand avowed enemies."

It was in the year 1519, when the expedition sailed from St. Lucar for Darien. We have no account
of the incidents which occurred during the voyage. The fleet reached Darien in safety, and
the Spanish adventurers, encased in coats of mail, which the arrows and javelins of the natives
could not pierce, mounted on powerful war horses, armed with muskets and cannon, and with packs
of ferocious bloodhounds at their command, were all prepared to scatter the helpless natives
before them, as the whirlwind scatters autumnal leaves.

De Soto was then but nineteen years of age. In stature and character he was a mature man. There
are many indications that he was a young man of humane and honorable instincts, shrinking from
the deeds of cruelty and injustice which he saw everywhere perpetrated around him. It is however
probable, that under the rigor of military law, he at times felt constrained to obey commands
from which his kindly nature recoiled.

Don Pedro was a monster of cruelty. He gave De Soto command of a troop of horse. He sent him
on many expeditions which required not only great courage, but military sagacity scarcely to
be expected in one so young and inexperienced. It is however much to the credit of De Soto,
that the annalists of those days never mentioned his name in connection with those atrocities
which disgraced the administration of Don Pedro. He even ventured at times to refuse obedience
to the orders of the governor, when commanded to engage in some service which he deemed dishonorable.

One remarkable instance of this moral and physical intrepidity is on record. Don Pedro had
determined upon the entire destruction of a little village occupied by the natives. The torch
was to be applied, and men, women and children, were to be put to the sword. Don Pedro had
issued such a command as this, with as much indifference as he would have placed his foot upon
an anthill. It is not improbable that one of the objects he had in view was to impose a revolting
task upon De Soto, that he might be, as it were, whipped into implicit obedience. He therefore
sent one of the most infamous of his captains to De Soto with the command that he should immediately
take a troop of horse, proceed to the doomed village, gallop into its peaceful and defenceless
street, set fire to every dwelling, and with their keen sabres, cut down every man, woman and
child. It was a deed fit only for demons to execute.

De Soto deemed himself insulted in being ordered on such a mission. This was not war,--it was
butchery. The defenceless natives could make no resistance. Indignantly and heroically he replied:

"Tell Don Pedro, the governor, that my life and services are always at his disposal, when the
duty to be performed is such as may become a Christian and a gentleman. But in the present
case, I think the governor would have shown more discretion by entrusting you, Captain Perez,
with this commission, instead of sending you with the order to myself."

This reply Captain Perez might certainly regard as reflecting very severely upon his own character,
and as authorizing him to demand that satisfaction which, under such circumstances, one cavalier
expects of another. He however carried the message to the governor. Don Pedro was highly gratified.
He saw that a duel was the necessary result. Captain Perez was a veteran soldier, and was the
most expert swordsman in the army. He was famed for his quarrelsome disposition; had already
fought many duels, in which he had invariably killed his man. In a rencontre between the youthful
De Soto and the veteran Captain Perez, there could be no doubt in the mind of the governor
as to the result. He therefore smiled very blandly upon Captain Perez, and said in language
which the captain fully understood:

"Well, my friend, if you, who are a veteran soldier, can endure the insolence of this young
man, De Soto, I see no reason why an infirm old man like myself should not show equal forbearance."

Captain Perez was not at all reluctant to take the hint. It was only giving him an opportunity
to add another to the list of those who had fallen before his sword. The challenge was immediately
given. De Soto's doom was deemed sealed. Duels in the Spanish army were fashionable, and there
was no moral sentiment which recoiled in the slightest degree from the barbaric practice.

The two combatants met with drawn swords in the presence of nearly all the officers of the
colonial army, and of a vast concourse of spectators. The stripling De Soto displayed skill
with his weapon which not only baffled his opponent, but which excited the surprise and admiration
of all the on-lookers. For two hours the deadly conflict continued, without any decisive results.
De Soto had received several trifling wounds, while his antagonist was unharmed. At length,
by a fortunate blow, he inflicted such a gash upon the right wrist of Perez, that his sword
dropped from his hand. As he attempted to catch it with his left hand, he stumbled and fell
to the ground. De Soto instantly stood over him with his sword at his breast, demanding that
he should ask for his life. The proud duellist, thus for the first time in his life discomfited,
was chagrined beyond endurance. In sullen silence, he refused to cry for mercy. De Soto magnanimously
returned his sword to its scabbard, saying: "The life that is not worth asking for, is not
worth taking."

He then gracefully bowed to the numerous spectators and retired from the field, greeted with
the enthusiastic acclaim of all who were present. This achievement gave the youthful victor
prominence above any other man in the army. Perez was so humiliated by his defeat, that he
threw up his commission and returned to Spain. Thus the New World was rid of one of the vilest
of the adventurers who had cursed it.

The region of the peninsula, and the adjoining territory of South America, were at that time
quite densely populated. The inhabitants seem to have been a happy people, not fond of war,
and yet by no means deficient in bravery. The Spanish colonists were but a handful among them.
But the war horse, bloodhounds, steel coats of mail and gunpowder, gave them an immense, almost
resistless superiority.

There was at this time, about the year 1521, an Indian chief by the name of Uracca, who reigned
over quite a populous nation, occupying one of the northern provinces of the isthmus. He was
a man of unusual intelligence and ability. The outrages which the Spaniards were perpetrating
roused all his energies of resentment, and he resolved to adopt desperate measures for their
extermination. He gathered an army of twenty thousand men. In that warm climate, in accordance
with immemorial usage, they went but half clothed. Their weapons were mainly bows, with poisoned
arrows; though they had also javelins and clumsy swords made of a hard kind of wood.

The tidings of the approach of this army excited the greatest consternation at Darien. A shower
of poisoned arrows from the strong arms of twenty thousand native warriors, driven forward
by the energies of despair, even these steel-clad adventurers could not contemplate without
dread. The Spaniards had taught the natives cruelty. They had hunted them down with bloodhounds;
they had cut off their hands with the sword; they had fed their dogs with their infants; had
tortured them at slow fires and cast their children into the flames. They could not expect
that the natives could be more merciful than the Spaniards had been.

Don Pedro, instead of waiting the arrival of his foes, decided to assail the army on its march,
hoping to take it by surprise and to throw consternation into the advancing ranks. He divided
his army of attack into two parties. One division of about one hundred men, he sent in two
small vessels along the western coast of the isthmus, to invade the villages of Uracca, hoping
thus to compel the Indian chief to draw back his army for the defence of his own territories.
This expedition was under the command of General Espinosa.

The main body of the Spanish troops, consisting of about two hundred men, marched along the
eastern shore of the isthmus, intending eventually to effect a junction with the naval force
in the realms of the foe. The energetic, but infamous Francisco Pizarro, led these troops.
A very important part of his command consisted of a band of dragoons, thirty or forty in number,
under the leadership of De Soto. His steel-clad warriors were well mounted, with housings which
greatly protected their steeds from the arrows of the natives.

The wary Indian chieftain, who developed during the campaign military abilities of a high order,
had his scouts out in all directions. They discerned in the distant horizon the approach of
the two vessels, and swift runners speedily reported the fact to Uracca. He immediately marched
with a force in his judgment sufficiently strong to crush the invaders, notwithstanding their
vast superiority in arms.

The Spaniards entered a sheltered bay skirted by a plain, which could be swept by their guns,
and where the Indian warriors would have no opportunity to hide in ambush. Uracca allowed the
Spaniards to disembark unopposed. He stationed his troops, several thousand in number, in a
hilly country, several leagues distant from the place of landing, which was broken with chasms
and vast boulders, and covered with tropical forest. Here every Indian could fight behind a
rampart, and the Spaniards could only approach in the scattered line of skirmishers. The proud
Spaniards advanced in their invading march with as much of war's pageantry as could be assumed.
They hoped that nodding plumes and waving banners, and trumpet peals, would strike with consternation
the heart of the Indians.

Uracca calmly awaited their approach. His men were so concealed that Espinosa could form no
judgment of their numbers or position. Indeed he was scarcely conscious that there was any
foe there who would venture to oppose his march. Accustomed as he was to ride rough shod over
the naked Indians, he was emboldened by a fatal contempt for the prowess of his foe. Uracca
allowed the Spaniards to become entangled in the intricacies of rocks and gullies and gigantic
forest trees, when suddenly he opened upon them such a shower of poisoned arrows as the Spaniards
had never encountered before. The touch of one of these arrows, breaking the skin, caused immediate
and intense agony, and almost certain death. The sinewy arms of the Indians could throw these
sharp-pointed weapons with almost the precision and force of a bullet, and with far greater
rapidity than the Spaniards could load and fire their muskets.

Espinosa found himself assailed by a foe outnumbering him ten or twenty to one. The air was
almost darkened with arrows, and every one was thrown with unerring aim. The rout of the Spaniards
was almost instantaneous. Several were killed, many wounded. In a panic, they turned and fled
precipitately from the trap in which they had been caught. The natives impetuously pursued,
showing no quarter, evidently determined to exterminate the whole band.

It so happened that De Soto, with his dragoons, had left Pizarro's band, and in a military
incursion into the country, was approaching the bay where Espinosa had landed his troops. Suddenly
the clamor of the conflict burst upon his ear--the shouts of the Indian warriors and the cry
of the fugitive Spaniards. His little band put spurs to their horses and hastened to the scene
of action. Very great difficulties impeded their progress. The rugged ground, encumbered by
rocks and broken by ravines, was almost impassable for horsemen. But the energy of De Soto
triumphed over these obstacles, even when the bravest of his companions remonstrated and hesitated
to follow him. At length he reached the open country over which the Spaniards were rushing
to gain their ships, pursued by the Indians in numbers and strength which seemed to render
the destruction of the Spaniards certain.

The natives stood in great dread of the horses. When they saw the dragoons, glittering in their
steel armor, come clattering down upon the plain, their pursuit was instantly checked. Espinosa,
thus unexpectedly reinforced, rallied his panic-stricken troops, and in good order continued
the retreat to the ships. De Soto with his cavalry occupied the post of danger as rear-guard.
The Indians cautiously followed, watching for every opportunity which the inequalities of the
ground might offer, to assail the invaders with showers of arrows. Occasionally De Soto would
halt and turn his horses' heads towards the Indians. Apprehensive of a charge, they would then
fall back. The retreat was thus conducted safely, but slowly.

The Spaniards had advanced many leagues from the shores of the Pacific. They were now almost
perishing from hunger and fatigue. Indian bands were coming from all directions to reinforce
the native troops. The sun was going down and night was approaching. All hearts were oppressed
with the greatest anxiety. Just then Pizarro, with his two hundred men, made his appearance.
He had not been far away, and a courier having informed him of the peril of the Spaniards,
he hastened to their relief. Night with its gloom settled down over the plain, and war's hideous
clamor was for a few hours hushed. The morning would usher in a renewal of the battle, under
circumstances which caused the boldest hearts in the Spanish camp to tremble.

In the night Generals Espinosa and Pizarro held a council of war, and came to the inglorious
resolve to steal away under the protection of darkness, leaving Uracca in undisputed possession
of the field. This decision excited the indignation of De Soto. He considered it a disgrace
to the Spanish arms, and declared that it would only embolden the natives in all their future
military operations. His bitter remonstrances were only answered by a sneer from General Espinosa,
who assured him that the veteran captains of Spain would not look to his youth and inexperience
for guidance and wisdom.

At midnight the Spaniards commenced their retreat as secretly and silently as possible. But
they had a foe to deal with who was not easily to be deceived. His scouts were on the alert,
and immediate notice was communicated to Uracca of the movements of the Spaniards. The pursuit
was conducted with as much vigor as the flight. For eight and forty hours the fugitives were
followed so closely, and with such fierce assailment, that large numbers of the rank and file
perished. The officers and the dragoons of De Soto, wearing defensive armor, generally escaped
unharmed. The remnant at length, weary and famine-stricken, reached their ships and immediately
put to sea. With the exception of De Soto's dragoons, they numbered but fifty men. Deeply despondent
in view of their disastrous campaign, they sailed several leagues along the western coast of
the isthmus towards the south, till they reached a flourishing Indian village called Borrica.
Conscious that here they were beyond the immediate reach of Uracca's avenging forces, they
ventured to land. They found all the men absent. They were probably in the ranks of the native
army.

General Espinosa, who was now chief in command, meanly sacked the defenceless village and captured
all the women and children, to be sent to the West Indies and sold as slaves. The generous
heart of De Soto was roused by this outrage. He was an imperious man, and was never disposed
to be very complaisant to his superiors. Sternly the young captain rebuked Espinosa as a kidnapper,
stealing the defenceless; and he demanded that the prisoners should be set at liberty. An angry
controversy ensued. De Soto accused Espinosa of cowardice and imbecility, in ordering the troops
of Spain to retreat before naked savages. Espinosa, whose domineering spirit could brook no
opposition, accused De Soto of mutinous conduct, and threatened to report him to the governor.
De Soto angrily turned his heel upon his superior officer and called upon his troops to mount
their horses. Riding proudly at their head, he approached the tent of Espinosa and thus addressed
him:

"Señor Espinosa, the governor did not place me under your command, and you have no claim to
my obedience. I now give you notice, that if you retain these prisoners so cruelly and unjustly
captured, you must do so at your own risk. If these Indian warriors choose to make any attempt
to recover their wives and their children, I declare to you upon my solemn oath, and by all
that I hold most sacred, that they shall meet with no opposition from me. Consider, therefore,
whether you have the power to defend yourself and secure your prey, when I and my companions
have withdrawn from this spot."

Pizarro does not seem to have taken any active part in this dispute, though he advised the
headstrong Espinosa to give up his captives. While these scenes were transpiring, about one
hundred of the men of the village returned. Most earnestly they entreated the release of their
wives and children. If not peacefully released, it was pretty evident that they would fight
desperately for their rescue. It was quite apparent that the Indian runners had gone in all
directions to summon others to their aid. The withdrawal of De Soto left Espinosa so weakened
that he could hardly hope successfully to repel such forces. Indeed he was so situated that,
destitute of provisions and ammunition, he did not dare to undertake a march back through the
wilderness to Darien. He therefore very ungraciously consented to surrender his captives.

Governor Don Pedro had established his headquarters at Panama. De Soto, accompanied by a single
dragoon, who like himself was an admirable horseman, rode with the utmost possible dispatch
to Panama, where he informed the governor of the disasters which had befallen the expedition,
and of the precarious condition in which he had left the remnant of the troops. He also made
such representation of the military conduct of General Espinosa as to induce the governor to
remove him from the command and send General Herman Ponce to take his place. The garrison at
Panama was then so weak that only forty men could be spared to go to the relief of the troops
at Borrica.

In the mean time the Indian chief Uracca had received full information of the position and
condition of the Spanish troops. Very sagaciously he formed his plan to cut off their retreat.
Detachments of warriors were placed at every point through which they could escape; they could
not venture a league from their ramparts on any foraging expedition, and no food could reach
them. They obtained a miserable subsistence from roots and herbs.

At length De Soto returned with a fresh supply of ammunition and the small reinforcement. By
the aid of his cavalry he so far broke up the blockade as to obtain food for the famishing
troops. Still it was very hazardous to attempt a retreat to Panama. With the reinforcements
led by General Ponce, their whole army, infantry and cavalry, amounted to less than one hundred
and fifty men. They would be compelled on their retreat to climb mountains, plunge into ragged
ravines, thread tropical forests and narrow defiles, where armies of uncounted thousands of
natives were ready to dispute their passage.

While governor Don Pedro was awaiting with intense anxiety the receipt of intelligence from
Borrica, a ship arrived from Spain bringing three or four hundred adventurers, all of whom
were eager for any military expedition which would open to them an opportunity for plunder.
One hundred and fifty of these were regular soldiers, well taught in the dreadful trade of
war. Don Pedro took these fresh troops and one hundred and fifty volunteers; and set out with
the utmost expedition for Borrica. His impetuous nature was inspired with zeal to retrieve
the disgrace which had befallen the Spanish arms. He took with him several pieces of ordnance,--guns
with which the Indians thus far had no acquaintance.

Upon arriving at Borrica he very earnestly harangued his troops, reminding them of the ancient
renown of the Spanish soldiers, and stimulating their cupidity by the assurance that the kingdom
of Veragua, over which Uracca reigned, was full of gold; and that all that was now requisite
for the conquest of the country and the accumulation of princely wealth, was a display of the
bravery ever characteristic of Spanish troops.

There was a deep and rapid river, the Arva, rushing down from the mountains, which it was necessary
for the Spaniards to cross in their renewed invasion of Veragua. On the northern banks of this
stream Uracca stationed his troops, selecting this spot with much skill as his main line of
defence. He however posted an advanced guard some miles south of the stream in ground broken
by hills, rocks and ravines, through which the Spaniards would be compelled to pass, and where
their cavalry could be of very little avail.

By great effort Don Pedro had collected an army of about five hundred men. Rapidly marching,
he soon reached the spot of broken ground where the native troops were stationed awaiting their
approach.

It seems almost incomprehensible that this band of thieves and murderers, who, without the
slightest excuse or provocation, were invading the territory of the peaceful natives, carrying
to their homes death and woe, that they might acquire fame for military exploits and return
laden with plunder, could have looked to God for his blessing upon their infamous expedition.
But so it was. And still more strange to say, they did not apparently engage in these religious
services with any consciousness of hypocrisy. The thoughtful mind is bewildered in contemplating
such developments of the human heart. Previous to the attack the whole army was drawn up for
prayers, which were solemnly offered by the ecclesiastics who always accompanied these expeditions.
Then every soldier attended the confessional and received absolution. Thus he felt assured
that, should he fall in the battle, he would be immediately translated to the realms of the blest.

Thus inspired by military zeal and religious fanaticism, the Spaniards rushed upon the natives
in a very impetuous assault. We are happy to record that the natives stood nobly on the defence.
They met their assailants with such a shower of arrows and javelins that the Spaniards were
first arrested in their march, then driven back, then utterly routed and put to flight. In
that broken ground where the cavalry could not be brought into action, where every native warrior
stood behind a tree or a rock, and where the natives did not commence the action till the Spaniards
were within half bow shot of them, arrows and javelins were even more potent weapons of war
than the clumsy muskets then in use.

Upon the open field the arrows of the natives were quite impotent. A bullet could strike the
heart at twice or three times the distance at which an arrow could be thrown. The Spaniards,
hotly pursued, retreated from this broken ground several miles back into the open plain. Many
were slain. Here the rout was arrested by the cavalry and the discharges from the field-pieces,
which broke the Indian ranks.

The natives, however, boldly held their ground, and the Spaniards, disheartened and mortified
by their discomfiture, encamped upon the plain. It was very evident that God had not listened
to their prayers.

For several days they remained in a state of uncertainty. For five hundred Spaniards to retreat
before eight hundred natives, would inflict a stigma upon their army which could never be effaced.
They dared not again attack the natives who were flushed with victory in their stronghold.
They were well aware that the band of warriors before them was but the advanced guard of the
great army of Uracca. These eight hundred natives were led by one of Uracca's brothers. Even
should these Indians be attacked and repulsed, they had only to retreat a few miles, cross
the river Arva in their canoes, and on the northern banks join the formidable army of twenty
thousand men under their redoubtable chief, who had already displayed military abilities which
compelled the Spaniards to regard him with dread.

Affairs were in this position when Uracca adopted a stratagem which completely deceived the
Spaniards and inflicted upon them very serious loss. He caused several of his warriors to be
taken captive. When closely questioned by Don Pedro where gold was to be found, and threatened
with torture if they refused the information, they with great apparent reluctance directed
their captors to a spot, at the distance of but a few leagues, where the precious metal could
be obtained in great abundance. These unlettered savages executed their artifice with skill
which would have done honor even to European diplomatists.

Don Pedro immediately selected a company of forty of his most reliable men and sent them to
the designated spot. Here they were surrounded by Indian warriors in ambush, and the whole
party, with the exception of three, put to death. The three who escaped succeeded in reaching
the Spanish camp with tidings of the disaster. Don Pedro in his rage ordered his captives to
be torn to pieces, by the bloodhounds. They were thrown naked to the dogs. The Spaniards looked
on complacently, as the merciless beasts, with bloody fangs, tore them limb from limb, devouring
their quivering flesh. The natives bore this awful punishment with fortitude and heroism, which
elicited the admiration of their foes. With their last breath they exulted that they were permitted
to die in defence of their country.

The expedition of Don Pedro had thus far proved an utter failure. He had already lost one-fourth
of his army through the prowess of the natives. The prospect before him was dark in the extreme.
His troops were thoroughly discouraged, and the difficulties still to be encountered seemed
absolutely insurmountable. Humiliated as never before, the proud Don Pedro was compelled to
order a retreat. He returned to Panama, where, as we have mentioned, he had removed his seat
of government from Darien. Panama was north of Darien, or rather west, as the isthmus there
runs east and west. Its seaport was on the Pacific, not the Atlantic coast.

Uracca, having thus rescued his country from the invaders, did not pursue the retreating Spaniards.
He probably in this course acted wisely. Could Don Pedro have drawn his enemies into the open
field, he could undoubtedly have cut down nearly their whole army with grape shot, musketry,
and charges by his strongly mounted steel-clad cavaliers. A panic had however pervaded the
Spanish camp. They were in constant apprehension of pursuit. Even when they had reached Panama,
they were day after day in intense apprehension of the approach of their outnumbering foes,
by whose valor they had already been discomfited, and so greatly disgraced.

    "When the Spaniards looked out towards the mountains and the
    plains," writes the Spanish historian Herrera, "the boughs of
    trees and the very grass, which grew high in the savannas,
    appeared to their excited imagination to be armed with
    Indians. And when they turned their eyes towards the sea,
    they fancied that it was covered with canoes of their
    exasperated foemen."

Uracca must have been in all respects an extraordinary man. We have the record of his deeds
only from the pen of his enemies. And yet according to their testimony, he, a pagan, manifested
far more of the spirit of Christ than did his Christian opponents. In the war which he was
then waging, there can be no question whatever that the wrong was inexcusably and outrageously
on the side of Don Pedro. We cannot learn that Uracca engaged in any aggressive movements against
the Spaniards whatever. He remained content with expelling the merciless intruders from his
country. Even the fiendlike barbarism of the Spaniards could not provoke him to retaliatory
cruelty. The brutal soldiery of Spain paid no respect whatever to the wives and daughters of
the natives, even to those of the highest chieftains.

On one occasion a Spanish lady, Donna Clara Albitez, fell into the hands of Uracca. He treated
her with as much delicacy and tenderness as if she had been his own daughter or mother, and
availed himself of the first opportunity of restoring her to her friends.

Though De Soto was one of the bravest of his cavaliers, and was so skilful as an officer that
his services were almost indispensable to Don Pedro, yet the governor was anxious to get rid
of him. It is probable that he felt somewhat condemned by the undeniable virtues of De Soto;
for the most of men can feel the power of high moral principle as witnessed in others. De Soto,
intensely proud, was not at all disposed to play the sycophant before his patron. He had already
exasperated him by his refusal to execute orders which he deemed dishonorable. And worst of
all, by winning the love of Isabella, he had thwarted one of the most ambitious of Don Pedro's
plans; he having contemplated her alliance with one of the most illustrious families of the
Spanish nobility.

Don Pedro did not dare to send De Soto to the scaffold or to order him to be shot. He had already
braved public opinion by the outrageous execution of Vasco Nuñez, without a shadow of law or
justice, and had drawn down upon himself an avalanche of condemnation from the highest dignitaries
of both church and state. He was trembling through fear that the Spanish government might call
him to account for this tyrannic act. Thus situated, it was highly impolitic to send De Soto,
who was greatly revered and admired by the army, to the block. He therefore still sought, though
with somewhat waning zeal, to secure the death of De Soto on the field of battle. De Soto could
not fail to perceive that Don Pedro was not his friend. Still, being a magnanimous man himself,
he could not suspect the governor of being guilty of such treachery as to be plotting his death.

When the little army of Spaniards was beleaguered at Borrica, and De Soto with his cavalry
was scouring the adjacent country on foraging expeditions, he chanced to rescue from captivity
M. Codro, an Italian philosopher, who had accompanied the Spaniards to Darien. In the pursuit
of science, he had joined the forty men who, under the command of Herman Ponce, had been sent
as a reinforcement to Borrica. While at some distance from the camp on a botanical excursion,
he was taken captive by the natives, and would have been put to death but for the timely rescue
by De Soto.

M. Codro was an astrologer. In that superstitious age he was supposed by others, and probably
himself supposed, that by certain occult arts he was able to predict future events. Six months
after the return of the Spaniards from their disastrous expedition against Uracca, this singular
man sought an interview with De Soto, and said to him:

"A good action deserves better reward than verbal acknowledgment. While it was not in my power
to make any suitable recompense to you for saving my life, I did not attempt to offer you any.
But the time has now come when I can give you some substantial evidence of my gratitude. I
can now inform you that your life is now in no less danger than mine was when you rescued me
from the Indians."

De Soto replied: "My good friend, though I do not profess to be a thorough believer in your
prophetic art, I am no less thankful for your kind intentions. And in this case, I am free
to confess that your information, from whatever source derived, is confirmed in a measure by
my own observations."

"Ferdinand De Soto," said the astrologer with great deliberation and solemnity of manner, "I
think I can read the page of your destiny, even without such light as the stars can shed upon
it. Be assured that the warning I give you does not come from an unearthly source. But if any
supernatural confirmation of my words were needed, even on that score you might be satisfied.
While comparing your horoscope with that of my departed friend Vasco Nuñez, I have observed
some resemblances in your lives and fortunes, which you, with all your incredulity, must allow
to be remarkable. Nuñez and you were both born in the same town; were both members of noble
but impoverished families; both sought to ally yourselves with the family of Don Pedro, and
both thus incurred his deadly resentment."

"These coincidences are certainly remarkable," replied De Soto; "but what other similarities
do you find in the destinies of Nuñez and myself?"

"You are a brave man," replied M. Codro, "and you are too skeptical to be much disturbed by
the prognostications of evil. I may therefore venture to tell you that according to my calculations,
you will be in one important event of your life more happy than Vasco Nuñez. It seems to be
indicated by the superior intelligences, that your death will not be in the ordinary course
of nature; but I find likewise that the term of your life will be equal to that which Nuñez
attained. When I consider your present circumstances, this appears to me to be the most improbable
part of the prediction."

Nuñez was forty-two years old at the time of his death. This gave De Soto the promise of nearly
twenty years more of life. Reverently he replied, "I am in the hands of God. I rely with humble
confidence on his protection."

"In that you do well," rejoined M. Codro. "Still it is your duty to use such human means as
may be required to defend yourself against open violence or fraudful malice."

De Soto thanked the astrologer for the caution he had given him, and as he reflected upon it,
saw that it was indeed necessary to be constantly on his guard. As time passed on Don Pedro
became more undisguised in his hostility to De Soto. Ferdinand and Isabella exerted all their
ingenuity to correspond with each other. Don Pedro had been equally vigilant in his endeavors
to intercept their letters; and so effectual were the plans which he adopted, that for five
years, while the lovers remained perfectly faithful to each other, not a token of remembrance
passed between them.

These were weary years to De Soto. He was bitterly disappointed in all his expectations. There
was no glory to be obtained even in victory, in riding rough-shod over the poor natives. And
thus far, instead of victory attending the Spanish arms, defeat and disgrace had been their
doom. Moreover, he was astonished and heartily ashamed when he saw the measures which his countrymen
had adopted to enrich themselves. They were highway robbers of the most malignant type. They
not only slaughtered the victims whom they robbed, but fired their dwellings, trampled down
their harvests and massacred their wives and children.

The most extravagant tales had been circulated through Europe respecting the wealth of the
New World. It was said that masses of pure gold could be gathered like pebble stones from the
banks of the rivers, and that gems of priceless value were to be found in the ravines. De Soto
had been now five years on the isthmus of Darien, and had acquired neither fame nor fortune,
and there was nothing in the prospect of the future to excite enthusiasm or even hope.

There was quite a remarkable man, made so by subsequent events, under the command of Don Pedro.
His name was Francisco Pizarro. He was a man of obscure birth and of very limited education,
save only in the material art of war. He could neither read nor write, and was thus intellectually
hardly the equal of some of the most intelligent of the natives. We have briefly alluded to
him as entrusted with the command of one portion of the army in the inglorious expedition against
Uracca. De Soto had very little respect for the man, and was not at all disposed as a subordinate
officer to look to him for counsel. Don Pedro, however, seems to have formed a high opinion
of the military abilities of Pizarro. For notwithstanding his ignominious defeat and retreat
from Veragua, he now appointed him as the leader of an expedition, consisting of one hundred
and thirty men, to explore the western coast of the isthmus by cruising along the Pacific Ocean.

Pizarro set sail from Panama on the fourteenth of November, 1524, in one small vessel. It was
intended that another vessel should soon follow to render such assistance as might be necessary.
De Soto was urged to become one of this party; but probably from dislike of Pizarro, refused
to place himself under his command.

The vessel, which was soon joined by its consort under Almagro, coasted slowly along in a northerly
direction, running in at every bay, and landing whenever they approached a flourishing Indian
village, plundering the natives and maltreating them in every shameful way. At length they
aroused such a spirit of desperation on the part of the natives, that they fell upon the buccaneers
with resistless ferocity. Two-thirds of the miscreants were slain. Pizarro barely escaped with
his life, having received severe wounds and being borne to his ship in a state of insensibility.

While Pizarro was absent on this ill-fated expedition, a new trouble befell Don Pedro. Las
Casas, a devoted Christian missionary, whose indignation was roused to the highest pitch by
the atrocities perpetrated upon the Indians, reported the inhuman conduct of Don Pedro to the
Spanish government. The King appointed Peter de Los Rios to succeed him. The new governor was
to proceed immediately to Panama and bring the degraded official to trial, and, if found guilty,
to punishment. The governor of a Spanish colony in those days was absolute. Don Pedro had cut
off the head of his predecessor, though that predecessor was one of the best of men. He now
trembled in apprehension of the loss of his own head. Conscious of his deserts, he was terror-stricken.

About four or five hundred miles north of Panama there was the magnificent province of Nicaragua.
The isthmus is here about one hundred and fifty miles in breadth, and the province being about
two hundred miles in a line from north to south, extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific
shores. Don Pedro was popular with his brutal soldiery, since he allowed them unlimited license
and plunder. He resolved, surrounded by them, to take refuge in Nicaragua. Nevertheless, to
render himself as secure as possible, he decided to send an agent to plead his cause at the
Spanish court.

Among those rude, unprincipled adventurers, men of violence and blood, it was very difficult
to find a suitable person. At length he fixed with much hesitation upon M. Codro, the astrologer.
He was a simple-minded, good man; learned, though very artless. M. Codro was strongly attached
to De Soto, the preserver of his life. As we have seen, he was well aware of the peril to which
his benefactor was hourly exposed from the malignity of the governor. Gladly therefore he accepted
the mission, as he hoped it would afford him an opportunity of conferring some favor upon his
imperilled friend.

Don Pedro had adopted the most rigorous measures to prevent any communication between the colony
and Spain, which was not subjected to his inspection. He was mainly influenced to this course
that he might prevent the interchange of any messages whatever between De Soto and Isabella.
The most severe penalties were denounced against all persons who should convey any writing
across the seas, excepting through the regular mails. But the grateful M. Codro declared himself
ready to run all risks in carrying a letter from De Soto to Isabella. Though De Soto at first
hesitated to expose his friend to such hazard, his intense desire to open some communication
with Isabella, at length induced him to accept the generous offer.

As we have mentioned, for five years not one word had passed between the lovers. It is said
that the following is a literal translation of the letter which De Soto wrote. We cannot be
certain of its authenticity, but it bears internal evidence of genuineness, and a manuscript
copy is in the library of a Spanish gentleman who has spent his life in collecting documents
in reference to the past history of his country:

     "MOST DEARLY BELOVED ISABELLA:

     "For the first time within five years, I write to you with
     some assurance that you will receive my letter. Many times
     have I written before; but how could I write freely when I
     had reason to fear that other eyes might peruse those fond
     expressions which your goodness and condescension alone
     could pardon? But what reason have I to hope that you can
     still look with favorable regard on my unworthiness? My
     mature judgment teaches me that this dream of my youth,
     which I have so long cherished, is not presumption merely,
     but madness.

     "When I consider your many perfections, and compare them
     with my own little deserving, I feel that I ought to
     despair, even if I could empty into your lap the treasure of
     a thousand kingdoms. How then can I lift my eyes to you when
     I have nothing to offer but the tribute of an affection
     which time cannot change, and which must still live when my
     last hope has departed.

     "O Isabella! the expectation which brought me to this land
     has not been fulfilled. I can gather no gold, except by such
     means as my honor, my conscience and yourself must condemn.
     Though your nobleness may pity one on whom fortune has
     disdained to smile, I feel that your relations are justified
     in claiming for you an alliance with exalted rank and
     affluence; and I love you far too well to regard my own
     happiness more than your welfare. If, therefore, in your
     extreme youth you have made a promise which you now regret,
     as far as it is in my power to absolve you from that
     engagement, you are released. On my side, the obligation is
     sacred and eternal. It is not likely that I shall ever
     return to my country. While I am banished from your
     presence, all countries are alike to me.

     "The person who brings you this exposes himself to great
     danger in his desire to serve me. I entreat you to use such
     precautions as his safety may require. If your goodness
     should vouchsafe any message to me, he will deliver it, and
     you may have perfect confidence in his fidelity. Pardon my
     boldness in supposing it possible that I still have a place
     in your remembrance. Though you may now think of me with
     indifference or dislike, do not censure me too severely for
     calling myself unchangeably and devotedly, Yours, DE SOTO."

It was supposed at that time that there must be a strait somewhere north of Panama across the
narrow isthmus, which would connect the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Several
expeditions had been fitted out in search of this all-important passage. Almost invariably
a company of priests joined these expeditions, who exerted all their energies to convert the
Indians to nominal Christianity. A fanatic adventurer by the name of Giles Gonzales, acquired
much celebrity for his success in inducing the natives to accept the Christian faith and to
acknowledge fealty to the king of Spain. He was at the head of one hundred steel-clad warriors.
His mode of persuasion, though unique, was very potent. When he approached the seat of the
chief of Nicaragua, he sent a courier to him with the following message:

"I am coming as a friend to teach you the only true religion, and to persuade you to recognize
the most powerful monarch on the globe. If you refuse to yield to my teachings, you must prepare
for battle, and I challenge you to meet me in the field."

The gentle and peace-loving natives contemplated with consternation these fierce Spaniards
mounted on powerful war horses, animals which they had never before seen, and glittering in
coats of mail. They had no religious creed to which they adhered with any tenacity. The Nicaraguan
chief unhesitatingly expressed his readiness to accept the new faith, and in token of friendship,
sent Gonzales a quantity of gold, equal it is said in value to seventy-five thousand dollars
of our money. The Spanish historian Herrera, whose record is generally deemed in the main accurate,
says that the chief, his family, and nine thousand of his subjects, were baptized and became
Christians. Influenced by this example, and by the glowing representations of the rewards which
were sure to follow the acceptance of the Christian faith, more than thirty-six thousand of
the natives were baptized within the space of half a year. The baptismal fees charged by Gonzales
amounted to over four hundred thousand dollars.

While Gonzales was engaged on his own responsibility in this career of spiritual conquest,
with its rich pecuniary accompaniment, Don Pedro sent two of his generals, Ferdinand de Cordova
and Ferdinand De Soto, to explore Nicaragua and take possession of it in his name. He assumed
that Gonzales, acting without authority, was engaged in a treasonable movement. The two parties
soon came into collision.

De Soto, with a party of fifty men, twenty of them being well mounted cavaliers, encamped at
a small village called Torebo. Gonzales was in the near vicinity with a little army of three
hundred men, two hundred of whom were Indians. In the darkness of the night, Gonzales fell
upon De Soto, and outnumbering him six to one, either killed or took captive all the thirty
footmen; while the cavaliers, on their horses, cut their way through and escaped. Gonzales
lost fifty of his best men in the conflict, and was so impressed with the military vigor of
De Soto, that he was not at all disposed again to meet him on the field of battle. He therefore
retired to a distant part of the province, where he vigorously engaged in the work of converting
the natives, never forgetting his baptismal fee.

De Soto and Cordova established themselves in a new town which they called Grenada. Here they
erected a church, several dwelling houses, and barracks for the soldiers. They also surrounded
the village with a trench and earthworks, as protection from any sudden assault. Gonzales was
a fugitive from justice, having assassinated an officer sent by Hernando Cortes to arrest him.

Cordova was a mild and humane man. Under his sway the Indians were prosperous and happy. Two
flourishing towns grew up rapidly quite near each other, Leon and Grenada. The climate was
delightful, the soil fertile, the means of living abundant. Many of the inhabitants of Panama
emigrated to this more favored region.

De Soto, leaving Cordova in command of Nicaragua, returned to Panama to report proceedings
to Don Pedro. It was not till then that he learned, to his extreme regret, that the Governor
had selected Nicaragua as a place for his future abode. He knew that the presence of the tyrannical
governor could only prove disastrous to the flourishing colony, and ruinous to the happiness
of the natives. The gloom with which the contemplation oppressed his mind spread over his speaking
countenance. The eagle eye of the suspicious governor immediately detected these indications
of discontent. With an air of deference, but in a tone of mockery, he said:

"I judge from your appearance, captain, that my Nicaraguan enterprise does not meet with your
cordial approbation."

De Soto boldly, and with great deliberation of words, replied:

"Governor Don Pedro, I confess that I feel but little interested in any of your movements or
intentions, except when they encroach upon the rights of others. Nicaragua is at this time
well governed by Ferdinand de Cordova. The change you propose to make, is to be deprecated
as one of the greatest misfortunes that could befall not only the Indian inhabitants of that
district, but our own countrymen likewise, who have flocked thither to escape from your jurisdiction."

The countenance of Don Pedro became pallid with rage. Struggling, however, to suppress the
unavailing outburst of his passion, he said, with a malignant smile:

"I thank you, Captain De Soto, for giving me this opportunity which I have so long desired.
Were I to permit such insolence to go unpunished, my authority in this colony would soon be
at an end."

"It is at an end," replied De Soto. "You must be aware that your successor, De Los Rios, is
now on his way to Panama."

"I do not choose," replied Don Pedro, "to debate this matter with you. I still claim the right
to command you as your superior military officer. I now command you to hold yourself and your
company in readiness to march. When we arrive at Leon, I promise you that full justice shall
be done to your friend De Cordova, and to yourself."

De Soto fully comprehended the significance of these threats. He wrote immediately to Cordova,
urging him to be on his guard. The inhabitants of Leon and Grenada, learning of the intention
of Don Pedro,--to take the government into his own hands,--entreated De Cordova to resist the
tyrant, promising him their unanimous and energetic support. But De Cordova declined these
overtures, saying, that all the authority to which he was legitimately entitled was derived
from Don Pedro, and that it was his duty to obey him as his superior officer, until he should
be deposed by the Spanish crown.

Just before Don Pedro, with his suite, left Panama for Nicaragua, M. Codro returned from Spain.
He brought dispatches to the governor, and also secretly a letter from Isabella to De Soto.
The spies of the governor, in his castle in Spain, watched every movement of M. Codro. The
simple minded man had very little skill in the arts of duplicity. These spies reported to Don
Pedro that M. Codro had held a secret interview with Isabella, and had frankly stated that
he was entrusted with a private message to her. Don Pedro knew that such a message could have
gone only from De Soto; and that unquestionably M. Codro had brought back from his daughter
a response. We may remark in passing, that the letter from Isabella to De Soto informed him
of the inflexible fidelity of Isabella, and filled the heart of De Soto with joy.

The malignant nature of Don Pedro was roused by these suspicions to intensity of action, and
he resolved upon direful revenge. As the new governor was hourly expected, he could not venture
upon any open act of assassination or violence, for he knew that in that case summary punishment
would be his doom. Calling M. Codro before him, he assumed his blandest smile, thanked the
artless philosopher for the services he had rendered him in Spain, and said that he wished
to entrust him with the management of a mineralogical survey of a region near the gulf of San
Miguel.

The good man was delighted. This was just the employment which his nature craved. He was directed
to embark in a vessel commanded by one of the governor's tools, an infamous wretch by the name
of De Valenzuela. This man had been for many years a private, and was then engaged in kidnapping
Indians for the slave trade. He was ordered as soon as the vessel was at sea, to chain M. Codro
to the foremast, to expose him to all the tortures of the blaze of a tropical sun by day and
chilling dews by night. The crew were enjoined to assail him with insulting mockery. Thus exposed
to hunger, burning heat, and incessant abuse, he was to be kept through these lingering agonies
until he died.

For ten days the good man bore this cruel martyrdom, when he breathed his last, and was buried
on a small island about a hundred miles southwest of Panama. This brutal assassination was
so conducted, that De Soto at the time had no knowledge of the tragedy which was being enacted.

Early in the year 1526, Don Pedro, surrounded by a large retinue of his obedient soldiery,
left Panama to assume the government of Nicaragua, to which he had no legitimate title. De
Soto accompanied the governor. Much as he detested his character, he could not forget that
he was the father of Isabella. When Don Pedro approached the little town of Leon, he sent a
courier before him, to order De Cordova to meet him in the public square, with his municipal
officers and his clergy, prepared to give an account of his administration.

De Soto with his horsemen was ordered to form in line on one side of the square. The foot soldiers
of Don Pedro surrounded the governor on the other side. All the vacant space was filled with
citizens and natives. By the side of the governor stood his executioner; a man of gigantic
stature and of herculean strength, whose massive sword few arms but his could wield. De Cordova
advanced to meet Don Pedro, and bowing respectfully before him, commenced giving an account
of the state of affairs in the province. Suddenly he was interrupted in his narrative by Don
Pedro, who with forced anger exclaimed:

"Silence, you hypocrite! Your treasonable projects cannot be hidden under these absurd pretensions
of loyalty and patriotism: I will now let your accomplices see how a traitor should be punished."

He made a sign to his executioner. His gleaming sword flashed through the air, and in an instant
the dissevered head of Cordova rolled in the dust. The headsman grasped the gory trophy by
the hair, and raising it high above his head exclaimed,

          "Behold the doom of a traitor."

All this took place in an instant. The spectators were horror stricken. De Soto instinctively
seized his sword, and would doubtless have put spurs to his horse, rushed upon the governor,
and plunged the weapon to the hilt in his breast, but for the restraining memories of the past.
Hesitatingly he returned his sword to its scabbard.

But Don Pedro had not yet finished the contemplated work of the day. Another victim he had
doomed to fall. A file of soldiers, very resolute men, led by a determined officer, crossing
the square, approached De Soto, at the head of his troops. Don Pedro then exclaimed in a loud
voice,

"Ferdinand De Soto, you are ordered to dismount and submit yourself to the punishment which
you have just seen inflicted on your traitorous comrade. Soldiers! drag him from his horse
if he refuse to obey."

The officer reached forth his hand to seize De Soto. Like lightning's flash, the sword of the
cavalier fell upon the officer, and his head was cleft from crown to chin. The spurs were applied
to the fiery steed. He plunged through the soldiers, knocking several of them down, and in
an instant De Soto had his sword's point at the breast of the governor. Shouts of "kill the
tyrant," rose from all parts of the square, which were echoed even from the ranks of Don Pedro's
soldiers. Again De Soto held back his avenging hand; but in words which made Don Pedro quake
in his shoes, he said,

"You hear the expression of public sentiment. You hear the wishes of those who are subject
to your authority. It is the voice of justice speaking through these people. In refusing to
obey the call, I am scarcely less guilty than yourself. But remember, Don Pedro, that in sparing
your life at this moment, I discharge all the obligations I have owed you. Miserable old man!
Be thankful that the recollection of one that is absent, can make me forget what I owe to my
murdered friend.

"I will now sheathe my sword, but I solemnly declare by the sacred emblem of the cross which
it bears, that I will never draw it again in your service."

The assassination, for it could hardly be called execution, of De Cordova, excited the general
indignation of the Spanish settlers. They all knew that Don Pedro had no authority from the
king of Spain to assume the government of Nicaragua, and that he was therefore an usurper.
The noble character which De Soto had exhibited, and his undeniable ability and bravery, had
won for him universal regard. The Spaniards generally rallied around him, and entreated him
to assume the command, promising him their enthusiastic support. They could not comprehend
why De Soto so persistently refused their solicitations. They knew nothing of the secret reasons
which rendered it almost impossible for De Soto to draw his sword against the father of Isabella.

As we have mentioned, it was generally supposed that there must be some strait between the
Isthmus of Darien and the southern frontiers of Mexico, which connected the waters of the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans. The king of Spain had offered a large reward for the discovery of this
passage. Several of the wealthy citizens of Leon organized an expedition in pursuit of this
object. De Soto was placed at its head. He selected, from his cavalry troop, five of his most
intelligent and energetic young men. They started from Leon, and followed along the coast of
the Pacific, in northwesterly course, penetrating every bay and inlet. They travelled on horseback
and encountered innumerable difficulties from the rugged and pathless wilderness, through which
they pressed their way. They also had much to fear from the unfriendly character of the natives,
whose hostility had been aroused by the outrages which companies of vagabond Spaniards had
inflicted upon them.

De Soto, however, and his companions, by their just and kindly spirit, soon won the regards
of the Indians. They found that the natives possessed large quantities of gold, which they
seemed to esteem of little value. Eagerly they exchanged the precious metal for such trinkets
as the explorers took with them. Upon this arduous expedition, which De Soto managed with consummate
skill, he was absent eleven months. Seven hundred miles of sea-coast were carefully explored,
and he became fully convinced that the looked-for strait did not exist. Though in this respect
the expedition had proved a failure, he returned to Leon quite enriched by the gold which he
had gathered. With honesty, rarely witnessed in those days, he impartially divided the treasure
among the projectors of the enterprise.

As De Soto was returning, he discovered a small Spanish vessel anchored near the present site
of San Salvador. As his men and horses were worn down by their fatiguing journey, he engaged
a passage in the vessel to Leon. Upon embarking he found the captain and crew consisted of
some of the most depraved and brutal men who had ever visited the New World. They were cruising
along the coast, watching for opportunity to kidnap the natives, to convey them to the West
Indies as slaves. The captain was the infamous Valenzuela, who, as agent of Don Pedro, had
tortured M. Codro to death.

De Soto had no knowledge, as we have mentioned, of the dreadful doom which had befallen his
friend. One day the fiendlike captain was amusing his crew with a recital of his past deeds
of villany. He told the story of the murder of Codro.

"He was," he said, "an old wizard whom Don Pedro, the governor of Panama, commissioned me to
torture and to put to death, in consequence of some treachery of which he had been guilty while
on a mission to Spain."

The words caught the ear of De Soto. He joined the group, and listened with breathless attention
and a throbbing heart, to the statement of Valenzuela.

"I chained the old fellow," said the captain, "to the mainmast, and the sailors amused themselves
by drenching him with buckets of cold water, till he was almost drowned. After several days,
he became so sick and exhausted, that we saw that our sport would soon be at an end. For two
days he was speechless. He then suddenly recovered the use of his voice, and endeavored to
frighten me by saying:

"'Captain, your treatment has caused my death. I now call upon you to hear the words of a dying
man. Within a year from this time, I summon you to meet me before the judgment seat of God.'"

Here the captain burst into a derisive and scornful laugh. He then added:

"Come comrades, we'll have a hamper of wine, and drink to the repose of M. Codro's soul."

De Soto stepped forward, and repressing all external exhibition of the rage which consumed
his soul, said calmly to the captain,

"You say that the astrologer prophesied that you should die within the year. When will that
year expire?"

"In about two weeks," the captain replied. "But I have no fear but that the prophet will prove
to be a liar."

"He shall not," De Soto added. And drawing from his scabbard his keen, glittering sword, with
one blow from his sinewy arm, severed the captain's head from his body. The ghastly trophy
rolled gushing with blood upon the deck. These wild and savage men were accustomed to such
scenes. They admired the courage of De Soto, and the marvellous skill with which, at one blow,
he had struck off the head of the captain. De Soto then turned to the crowd and said:

"Gentlemen, if any of you are disposed to hold me accountable for what I have just done, I
am ready to answer you according to your desires. But I consider myself bound, in reason and
in courtesy, to inform you, that M. Codro, the man whom this villain murdered, was my friend;
and I doubt not that he was condemned to death for doing me an important service."

All seemed satisfied with this explanation. These sanguinary scenes in those days produced
but a momentary impression.

De Soto and Don Pedro no longer held any intercourse with each other. The reign of the usurping
governor was atrocious beyond the power of language to express. With horses and bloodhounds
he ran down the natives, seizing and selling them as slaves. Droves of men, women and children,
chained together, were often driven into the streets of Leon.

The assumption then was that a nominal Christian might pardonably inflict any outrages upon
those who had not accepted the Christian faith. Several of the Indian chiefs had embraced Christianity.
Don Pedro compelled them all to pay him a tribute of fifty slaves a month. All orphans were
to be surrendered as slaves. And then the wretch demanded that all parents who had several
children, should surrender one or more, as slaves to the Spaniards. The natives were robbed
of their harvests, so that they had no encouragement to cultivate the soil. This led to famine,
and more than twenty thousand perished of starvation. Famine introduced pestilence. The good
Las Casas declares that in consequence of the oppressions of the Spaniards, in ten years, more
than sixty thousand of the natives of Nicaragua perished.

About this time Francisco Pizarro had embarked in a hair-brained enterprise for the conquest
of Peru, on the western coast of South America. It was concerning "Darby and Joan" and reminiscent
of the wonderful J.L. MOLLOY ditty of the same name. Musically, none of it was especially memorable
beyond that. No matter how you look at it, Sweet Nancy was not exactly overflowing with significant
plotting; even those who consider an opera's storyline secondary to its musicality would probably
bemoan the sheer lack of events. Performances, however, were top-notch, featuring great turns
from Miss HUGHES and, as we mentioned, that former Lancashire Lad HENRY NEVILLE -- now all grown
up.

It might not be my first choice if I had to watch the same show night after night for the next
thousand years -- which, even in China (I think) is a faÃ§on de parler -- but I'd see it again,
nonetheless. If I was a nit-picky mood, I could criticize the overlong performance time, a
characteristic that is prolonged even further by the fact that certain are meant to be young
male students, and a girl who's just turned thirteen. The adaptation was handled by poet and
playwright, Mr. BUCHANAN who has made his mark (relatively speaking) on numerous past projects
with, more of than not, a successful outcome.

He has a gift for transforming established work into newly-invigorated creations. My hope is
that, upon my return to this vibrant city, I'll discover he's reinterpreted
School for Scandal and revived Hamlet with a modern spin.

Most sincerely, A CRITIC FROM THE COUNTRY

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.

Monday-Saturday. Nothing especially notable during this time. The
July Newmarket meeting (number two, for those who're counting) prevented
a lot of people from attending, and Thursday's showers, thunderstorms
and intermittent hail had a similar effect. So let's focus for a moment
on Esmeralda, which I was unable to do a week ago due to time constraints.
The diverse collection of elements -- a performance of a French libretto
set by an English composer and staged at the Royal Italian Opera,
Covent Garden -- might seem to make for a disjointed result. Not to
fear, however. It was a winner for all involved, from DRURIOLANUS
on down. One would be hard-pressed to find a more pleasing Esmeralda
than that offered by Madame MELBA (even though her take on the first
musical offering -- "L'Hirondelle" -- was less than spectacular).

The metropolis of the empire was the city of Cuzo, which was situated in a soft and luxuriant
valley traversing some table-lands which were about twelve thousand feet above the level of
the sea. The government of the country was an absolute monarchy. But its sovereign, called
the Inca, seems to have been truly a good man, the father of his people; wisely and successfully
seeking their welfare. The Peruvians had attained a degree of excellence in many of the arts
unsurpassed by the Spaniards. Their houses were generally built of stone; their massive temples,
though devoid of architectural beauty, were constructed of hewn blocks of granite, so admirably
joined together that the seams could be with difficulty discerned.

Humbolt found, among the ruins of these temples, blocks of hewn stone thirty-six feet long,
nine feet wide, and six feet in thickness. Their great highways, spanning the gulfs, clinging
to the precipitous cliffs and climbing the mountains, were wonderful works of mechanical skill.

De Soto was thoroughly acquainted with the cruel, faithless, and treacherous character of Pizarro.
A stigma must ever rest upon his name, for consenting to enter into any expedition under the
leadership of such a man. It may however be said, in reply, that he had no intention of obeying
Pizarro in any thing that was wrong; that his love of adventure was roused by the desire to
explore one of the most magnificent empires in the New World, which rumor had invested with
wealth and splendor surpassing the dreams of romance. And perhaps, most important of all, he
hoped honestly to be able to gather from the fabled mines of gold, with which Peru was said
to be filled, that wealth with which he would be enabled to return to Spain and claim the hand,
as he had already won the heart, of the fair and faithful Isabella.

Pizarro had entered upon his enterprise with an army of one hundred and eighty men, twenty-seven
of whom were mounted. It seems to be the uncontradicted testimony of contemporary historians,
that this army was composed of as worthless a set of vagabonds as ever disgraced humanity.
There was no crime or cruelty from which these fiends in human form would recoil.

Pizarro, following down the western coast of South America five or six hundred miles, had reached
the island of Puna, in the extreme northern part of Peru. It was separated from the mainland
by a narrow strait. The inhabitants received him cordially, but the murders, rapine and other
nameless atrocities, perpetrated by the Spaniards upon the friendly natives, soon so aroused
their resentment that a conspiracy was formed for the entire extermination of the invaders.
The expedition had become so weakened and demoralized that even Pizarro saw that it would be
the height of imprudence for him to venture, with his vile crew, upon the mainland, before
reinforcements under some degree of military discipline should arrive. He was in this precarious
condition, and on the eve of extermination, when De Soto and his select and well-ordered troops
reached the island.

They came in two vessels, bringing with them an abundant supply of arms and ammunition. The
party consisted of fifty men, thoroughly equipped. Thirty of them were steel-clad cavaliers,
well mounted. De Soto had been offered the rank of second in command. But when he arrived at
Puna, he found that Pizarro's brother--Hernando--occupied this post, and that he had no intention
of relinquishing it. De Soto reproached Pizarro in very plain terms for this wrong and insult.
He however did not allow it long to trouble him. Surrounded by his own brave and devoted followers,
he felt quite independent of the authority of Pizarro, and had no intention of obeying him
any farther than might be in accordance with his own wishes.

On the other hand, Pizarro had but little confidence in his brother, and was fully conscious
that the success of his enterprise would be mainly dependent upon the energy and skill of De Soto.

Pizarro, now finding himself at the head of really a formidable force, prepared to pass over
to the mainland. There was quite a large town there called Tumbez, surrounded by a rich and
densely populated country. The Peruvians had gold in abundance, and weapons and utensils of
copper. With iron and steel, they were entirely unacquainted. As when fighting at a distance,
the bullet of the Spaniard was immeasurably superior to the arrow of the native, so in a hand
to hand fight, the keen and glittering sabre of steel, especially in the hands of steel-clad
cavaliers left the poorly armed Peruvians almost entirely at their mercy.

Arrangements were made to cross the strait and make a descent upon Tumbez. Pizarro had already
visited the place, where he had been kindly received by the inhabitants, and where he had seen
with his own eyes that the houses and temples were decorated with golden ornaments, often massive
in weight, and of almost priceless value. He floated his little band across the narrow strait
on rafts.

The inhabitants of Tumbez and its vicinity had been disposed to receive their Spanish visitors
as guests, and to treat them with the utmost courtesy and kindness. But the tidings had reached
them of the terrible outrages which they had inflicted upon the inhabitants of Puna. They therefore
attacked the Spaniards as they approached the shore on their rafts and endeavored to prevent
their landing. But the invaders, with musketry and a cannon which they had with them, speedily
drove off their assailants, and with horses and hounds planted their banners upon the shore.
They then marched directly upon Tumbez, confident of gathering, from the decorations of her
palaces and her temples, abounding wealth. Bitter was their disappointment. The Peruvians,
conscious of their probable inability to resist the invaders, had generally abandoned the city,
carrying with them, far away into the mountains, all their treasures.

The Spaniards, who had entered the city with hideous yells of triumph, being thus frustrated
in the main object of their expedition, found, by inquiry, that at the distance of several
leagues easterly from the sea-coast, among the pleasant valleys of the mountains, there were
populous cities, where abundance of booty might be found.

The whole number of Spaniards, then invading Peru, did not exceed two hundred and fifty. The
Peruvians were daily becoming more deeply exasperated. With such a number of men, and no fortified
base to fall back upon, Pizarro did not deem it safe to enter upon a plundering tour into the
interior. Keeping therefore about one hundred and thirty men with him, and strongly fortifying
himself at Tumbez, he sent De Soto, at the head of eighty men, sixty of whom were mounted,
back into the mountains, to search for gold, and to report respecting the condition of the
country, in preparation for future expeditions.

The bad fame of Pizarro was spreading far and wide. And though De Soto enjoined it strictly
upon his men, not to be guilty of any act of injustice, still he was an invading Spaniard,
and the Peruvians regarded them all as the shepherd regards the wolf. De Soto had passed but
a few leagues from the seashore, ere he entered upon the hilly country. As he was ascending
one of the gentle eminences, a band of two thousand Indians, who had met there to arrest his
progress, rushed down upon him. His sixty horsemen instantly formed in column and impetuously
charged into their crowded ranks. These Peruvians had never seen a horse before. Their arrows
glanced harmless from the impenetrable armor, and they were mercilessly cut down and trampled
beneath iron hoofs. The Spaniards galloped through and through their ranks, strewing the ground
with the dead. The carnage was of short duration. The panic-stricken Peruvians fled wherever
there was a possibility of escape. The trumpets of the conquerors pealed forth their triumphant
strains. The silken banners waved proudly in the breeze, and the victors exultingly continued
their march through one of the defiles of the mountains.

Whatever excuses De Soto may make for himself, humanity will never forgive him for the carnage
of that day. Having thus fairly embarked upon this enterprise, where he was surely gaining
military renown, infamous as it was, and where there was the prospect before him of plunder
of incalculable worth, De Soto seems to have assumed to act upon his own responsibility, and
to have paid very little regard to the authority of Pizarro, whom he had left behind. He had
already penetrated the country much farther than he had been authorized to do by the orders
of his superior. One of the men, whom Pizarro had sent with him, very probably as a spy upon
his movements, deserted, and returned to Tumbez with the report that De Soto was already practically
in revolt, and had renounced all dependence on Pizarro. For this alleged insubordination, Pizarro
did not venture to call his energetic lieutenant to account.

In the mean time, Pizarro was exploring the country in the vicinity of Tumbez, for the site
of the colony he wished to establish. He selected a position about ninety miles south of that
city, in a rich and well-watered valley which opened upon the placid surface of the Pacific.
His troops were transported to the spot by the two vessels. Here he laid the foundations of
a town, which he called San Miguel. With timber from the mountains, and stone from the quarries,
and the labor of a large number of natives, who were driven to daily toil, not as servants,
by the stimulus of well-paid labor, but as slaves, goaded by the sabres of their task masters,
quite a large and strongly-fortified town rapidly arose.

De Soto continued his explorations in the interior for some time, and discovered a very magnificent
highway, leading to the capital of the empire. It was smoothly paved with flat blocks of stone,
or with cement harder than stone. He returned to San Miguel with the report of his discoveries,
and quite richly laden with the gold which he had received as a present from the natives, or
which he had seized as what he considered the lawful spoils of war. The sight of the gold inspired
all the Spaniards at San Miguel with the intense desire to press forward into a field which
promised so rich a harvest.

It was ascertained that the Inca had command of an army of over fifty thousand men. Pizarro,
leaving sixty men in garrison at San Miguel, set out with one hundred and ninety men to visit
the Inca in his capital. De Soto accompanied him. It was not ostensibly a military expedition,
seeking the conquest of the country, or moving with any hostile intent whatever. De Soto had
a conscience; Pizarro had none. Whatever reproaches might arise in the mind of De Soto in reference
to the course he was pursuing, he silenced them by the very plausible assumption that he was
an ambassador from the king of Spain, commissioned to make a friendly visit to the monarch
of another newly-discovered empire; that he was the messenger of peace seeking to unite the
two kingdoms in friendly relations with each other for their mutual benefit. This was probably
the real feeling of De Soto. The expedition was commissioned by the king of Spain. The armed
retinue was only such as became the ambassadors of a great monarch. Such an expedition was
in every respect desirable. The fault--perhaps we ought in candor to say the calamity--of De
Soto was in allowing himself to be attached to an expedition under a man so thoroughly reckless
and unprincipled as he knew Pizarro to have been. Perhaps he hoped to control the actions of
his ignorant and fanatic superior officer. It is quite manifest that De Soto did exert a very
powerful influence in giving shape to the expedition.

An Indian courier was sent forward to Cuzco, one of the capitals of the Peruvian monarch, with
a friendly and almost an obsequious message to the Inca, whose name was Attahuallapa. The courier
bore the communication that Pizarro was an ambassador commissioned by the king of Spain to
visit the king of Peru, and to kiss his hand in token of peace and fraternity. He therefore
solicited that protection in passing through the country which every monarch is bound to render
to the representatives of a foreign and friendly power.

Pizarro, as it will be remembered, was a rough and illiterate soldier, unable either to read
or write. In this sagacious diplomatic arrangement, we undoubtedly see the movement of De Soto's
reflective and cultivated mind. The expedition moved slowly along, awaiting the return of the
courier. He soon came back with a very indefinite response, and with a present of two curiously
carved stone cups, and some perfumery. The guarded reply and the meagre present excited some
alarm in the Spanish camp. It was very evident that the expedition was not to anticipate a
very cordial reception at the Peruvian court. Pizarro was much alarmed. He was quite confident
that the Inca was trying to lure them on to their ruin. Having called a council of war, he
urged that they should proceed no farther until he had sent some faithful Indian spies to ascertain
the intentions of Attahuallapa.

But De Soto, whose youthful energies were inspired by love and ambition, was eager to press
forward.

"It is not necessary," said he, "for the Inca to use treachery with us. He could easily overpower
us with numbers were he so disposed. We have also heard that he is a just and merciful prince;
and the courtesy he has already shown us, is some token at least of his good will. But why
should we hesitate? We have no longer any choice but to go forward. If we now retreat, it will
prove our professions to be false; and when the suspicions of the Inca are once aroused, we
shall find it impossible to escape from his country."

Pizarro's brother--Hernando--was a man of ignoble birth, of ruffianly manners, of low and brutal
character. Tauntingly he inquired of De Soto, if he were ready to give proof of his confidence
in the faith of the Peruvian monarch, by going forward to his court, as an envoy from the embassy.

De Soto turned his keen and flashing eye upon the man, whom he despised, and said in slow and
measured words:

"Don Hernando, I may yet convince you that it is neither civil nor safe to call my sincerity
in question. I have as much confidence in the honor of the Inca as I have in the integrity
of any man in this company, not excepting the commander or yourself. I perceive that you are
disposed to go backward. You may all return, when and how you please, or remain where you are.
But I have made up my mind to present myself to Attahuallapa. And I shall certainly do so,
without asking the assistance or permission of any of your party."

This was certainly a very defiant speech. It asserted his entire rejection of the authority
of Pizarro. De Soto could not have dared thus to have spoken, unless he had felt strong in
the support of his own dragoons.

Hernando Pizarro was silent, indulging only in a malignant smile. It was not safe for him to
provoke De Soto to a personal rencontre. Francisco Pizarro smothered his chagrin and very adroitly
availed himself of this statement, to commission De Soto to take twenty-four horsemen, such
as he might select, and accompanied by an Indian guide called Filipillo, go forward to the
Peruvian court.

Both of the Pizarros seemed quite relieved when the sound of the departing squadron of brave
cavaliers died away in the distance. De Soto, during the whole of his adventurous life, seems
to have been entirely unconscious of the emotion of fear. During his residence in the camp
of the Pizarros, he had exerted a powerful restraint upon their ferocious natures. He had very
earnestly endeavored to impress their minds with the conviction that they could not pass through
the populous empire of Peru, or even remain in it, if their followers were allowed to trample
upon the rights of the natives. So earnestly and persistently did he urge these views, that
Pizarro at length acknowledged their truth, and in the presence of De Soto, commanded his men
to abstain from every act of aggression.

But now that De Soto was gone, the Pizarros and their rabble rout of vagabonds breathed more
freely. Scarcely had the plumed helmets of the cavaliers disappeared in the distance, when
Hernando Pizarro set out on a plundering expedition into the villages of the Peruvians. The
natives fled in terror before the Spaniards. Pizarro caught one of the leading men and questioned
him very closely respecting the designs of Attahuallapa. The captive honestly and earnestly
declared, that he knew nothing about the plans of his sovereign.

This demoniac Hernando endeavored to extort a confession from him by torture. He tied his victim
to a tree, enveloped his feet in cotton thoroughly saturated with oil and applied the torch.
The wretched sufferer in unendurable agony, said "yes" to anything and everything. Two days
after, it was proved that he could not have known anything respecting the intended operations
of the Inca. It is a satisfaction to one's sense of justice to remember that there is a God
who will not allow such crimes to go unpunished.

De Soto, with his bold cavaliers, pressed rapidly on towards the Peruvian camp. Very carefully
he guarded against every act of hostility or injustice. Everywhere the natives were treated
with the utmost courtesy. In the rapid advance of the Spaniards through the country, crowds
flocked to the highway attracted by the novel spectacle. And a wonderful spectacle it must
have been! These cavaliers, with their nodding plumes, their burnished armor, their gleaming
sabres, their silken banners, mounted on magnificent war horses and rushing along over the
hills and through the valleys in meteoric splendor, must have presented an aspect more imposing
to their minds than we can well imagine.

De Soto, who had not his superior as a horseman in the Spanish army, was mounted on a milk
white steed of extraordinary size and grace of figure, and wore a complete suit of the most
costly and showy armor. It is said that on one occasion his path was crossed by a brook twenty
feet wide. The noble animal disdained to wade through, but cleared it at a single bound.

The crowds who lined the highways seemed to understand and appreciate the friendly feelings
De Soto manifested in gracefully bowing to them and smiling as he passed along. He soon ascertained,
though his guide Filipillo, that the headquarters of the Peruvian camp was at a place now called
Caxamarca, among the mountains, about eighty miles northeast of the present seaport of Truxillo.

After a rapid ride of about six hours, the expedition approached quite a flourishing little
town called Caxas. Several hundred Peruvian soldiers were drawn up in battle array in the outskirts,
to arrest the progress of the Spaniards. De Soto halted his dragoons, and sent forward Filipillo
to assure the commandant that he was traversing the country not with any hostile intent, and
that he bore a friendly message from his own sovereign to the king of Peru.

The kindly disposed Peruvians immediately laid aside their arms, welcomed the strangers, and
entertained them with a sumptuous feast. Thus refreshed, they pressed on several leagues farther,
until they reached a much larger city called Guancabama. From all the accounts given it would
seem that the inhabitants of this region had reached a degree of civilization, so far as the
comforts of life are concerned, fully equal to that then to be found in Spain. This city was
on the magnificent highway which traversed fifteen hundred miles through the very heart of
the empire. The houses, which were built of hewn stone, admirably jointed, consisted of several
rooms, and were distinguished for cleanliness, order, and domestic comfort.

The men seemed intelligent, the women modest, and various arts of industry occupied their time.
De Soto testified that the great highway which passed through this place far surpassed in grandeur
and utility any public work which had ever been attempted in Spain. Happy and prosperous as
were the Peruvians, compared with the inhabitants of most other countries, it is quite evident
that the ravages of the Fall were not unknown there.

Just before entering the town, De Soto passed a high gibbet upon which three malefactors were
hung in chains, swaying in the breeze. That revolting spectacle revealed the sad truth that
in Peru, as well as elsewhere, man's fallen nature developed itself in crime and woe. The Emperor
had also a large standing army, and the country had just been ravaged by the horrors of civil war.

De Soto was kindly received at Guancabama. Just as he was about to leave for Caxamarca, an
envoy from the Inca reached the city on its way to the Spanish camp. The ambassador was a man
of high rank. Several servants accompanied him, laden with presents for Pizarro. He entreated
De Soto to return with him to the headquarters of the Spaniards. As these presents and this
embassy would probably convince Pizarro of the friendly feeling of the Peruvian monarch, De
Soto judged it wise to comply with his request. Thus he turned back, and the united party soon
reached Pizarro's encampment.

The report which De Soto brought back was in many respects quite alarming to the Pizarros.
Though they were delighted to hear of the wealth which had been discovered, and the golden
ornaments decorating houses, temples and shrines, they were not a little alarmed in the contemplation
of the large population over which the Inca reigned, and of the power of his government. The
spectacle of the gallows also at Guancabama, caused very uncomfortable sensations.

Both of these men were aware that they and their troops had committed crimes which would doom
them to the scaffold, should the Inca be able to punish them according to their deserts. Indeed
it subsequently appeared, that the Inca had heard of their outrages. But with humanity and
a sense of justice which reflects lustre upon his name, he had resolved not to punish them
unheard in their own defence. He knew not but that false representations had been made of the
facts. He knew not but that the Spaniards had been goaded to acts of retaliation by outrages
on the part of the Peruvians.

He therefore invited the Spanish adventurers to meet him at Caxamarca, assuring them of a safe
passage to that place. With fear and trembling Pizarro consented, with his little band of two
hundred and fifty men, to visit the Peruvian camp, where fifty thousand soldiers might be arrayed
against him. The path they were to traverse led through defiles of the mountains, where a few
hundred men could arrest the march of an army. The Spaniards afterwards could not but admit,
that had the Inca cherished any perfidious design, he might with the utmost ease have utterly
exterminated them. Not a man could have escaped.

The march of these trembling men was not with the triumphant tramp of conquerors. They did
not enter the Peruvian camp with flourish of trumpets and bugle blasts, but as peaceful ambassadors,
with a showy retinue, who had been permitted to traverse the country unharmed. The sun was
just sinking behind the rugged peaks of the mountains on the fifteenth of November, 1532, when
Pizarro's band rode into the streets of Caxamarca. In the centre of the town there was a large
public square. On one side of that square was a spacious stone edifice, which the Inca had
caused to be prepared for the accommodation of his guests. This building was a part of a strong
fortress, within whose massive walls, a small party of well armed men might easily defend themselves
against a host.

The fact that Attahuallapa assigned to them such quarters, proves conclusively that he had
no intention to treat them otherwise than in the most friendly manner. The Inca, with the troops
immediately under his command, was encamped at a distance of about three miles from the town.
The treacherous Pizarro was ever apprehensive of treachery on the part of others. He was an
entire stranger to that calm and peaceful courage which seemed always to reign in the bosom
of De Soto.

Immediately after he reached Caxamarca he dispatched De Soto to inform the Inca of his arrival.
The Peruvian camp covered several acres of ground, with substantial and commodious tents. In
the centre there was truly a magnificent pavilion, gorgeous in its decorations, which was appropriated
to the Inca. Attahuallapa was informed of the approach of the Spanish cavaliers. He came from
his tent and took his seat upon a splendid throne prepared for the occasion. The Peruvian soldiers
gazed with amazement upon the spectacle of these horsemen as they were led into the presence
of their sovereign.

De Soto, with the native grace which attended all his actions, alighted from his horse, bowed
respectfully to the monarch, and said in words which were interpreted by Filipillo.

"I am sent by my commander, Don Francisco Pizarro, who desires to be admitted to your presence,
to give you an account of the causes which have brought him to this country, and other matters
which it may behoove your majesty to know. He humbly entreats you to allow him an interview
this night or to-morrow, as he wishes to make you an offer of his services, and to deliver
the message which has been committed to him by his sovereign, the king of Spain."

Attahuallapa replied with much dignity and some apparent reserve, that he cordially accepted
the friendly offers of Pizarro, and would grant him the desired interview the following morning.
The Inca was a young man about thirty years of age. He was tall, admirably formed, and with
a very handsome countenance. But there was an expression of sadness overspreading his features,
and a pensive tone in his address, indicating that he was a man who had seen affliction.

The splendid steed from which De Soto had alighted was restlessly pawing the ground at a short
distance from the tent of the Inca, attracting the particular attention and admiration of the
sovereign. De Soto, perceiving the admiration which his steed elicited, remounted, and touching
the spirited animal with the spur, went bounding with almost the speed of the wind over the
level plain, causing his horse now to rear, and now to plunge, wheeling him around, and thus
exhibiting his excellent qualities. He then came down at full speed to the spot where the Inca
stood, until within a few feet of the monarch, when he checked his horse so suddenly as to
throw him back upon his haunches. Some of the attendants of the Inca were evidently alarmed;
but the Inca himself stood proudly immovable. He reproved his attendants for their timidity;
and Mr. Prescott, who represents Attahuallapa as a very cruel man, intimates that he put some
of them to death that evening for betraying such weakness before the strangers. Refreshments
were offered to De Soto and his party, and a sort of wine was presented to them in golden cups,
of extraordinary size.

As De Soto, having fulfilled his mission, was about to leave the royal presence and return
to Caxamarca, Attahuallapa said:

"Tell your companions, that as I am keeping a fast, I cannot to-day accept their invitation.
I will come to them to-morrow. I may be attended by a large and armed retinue. But let not
that give you any uneasiness. I wish to cultivate your friendship and that of your king. I
have already given ample proof that no harm is intended you, though your captain, I am told,
mistrusts me. If you think it will please him better, I will come with few attendants and those
unarmed."

De Soto warmly assured the Inca that no man could doubt his sincerity, and begged him to consult
his own taste entirely in reference to the manner in which he would approach the Spaniards.

Upon the return of the cavalier to Pizarro, with an account of the interview, that perfidious
chieftain proposed to his men, that they should seize the Inca and hold him in captivity as
a hostage.

The next morning was Saturday, the 16th of November, 1532. The sun rose in a cloudless sky,
and great preparations were made by the Inca to display his grandeur and his power to his not
very welcome guests. A large retinue preceded and followed the monarch, while a courier was
sent forward to inform Pizarro of his approach. The Inca, habited in a dress which was glittering
with gems and gold, was seated in a gorgeous open palanquin, borne upon the shoulders of many
of his nobles.

It was five o'clock in the afternoon, when the Inca, accompanied by a small but unarmed retinue,
entered the public square of the city. The tents of his troops left outside, spread far and
wide over the meadows, indicating the presence of an immense host. The Inca was clothed in
a flowing robe of scarlet, woven of the finest wool, and almost entirely covered with golden
stars and the most precious gems. His head was covered with a turban of variegated colors,
to which there was suspended a scarlet fringe, the badge of royalty. The palanquin, or throne,
on which he was seated, was apparently of pure gold; and the cushion upon which he sat was
covered with the most costly gems. His nobles were also dressed in the highest possible style
of Peruvian wealth and art. It was estimated that the number of the nobles and officers of
the court who accompanied the king into the square, was about two thousand. A large company
of priests was also in attendance, who chanted the Peruvian National Hymn.

It is very difficult for an honest mind to form any just conception of such a religious fanatic,
and such an irreligious wretch as this Francisco Pizarro. Just before the Peruvians arrived
he had attended a solemn mass, in which the aid of the God of the Christians was fervently
implored in behalf of their enterprise. The mass was closed with chanting one of the psalms
of David, in which God is called upon to arise and come to judgment. Friar Vincent, who was
Pizarro's spiritual adviser, and grand chaplain of the so-called Christian army, was then sent
forward with the Bible in one hand and a crucifix in the other, to expound to the Inca the
doctrines of the Christian faith, stating that it was for that purpose, and for that only,
that the Spaniards had come into the country.

So far as we can judge from the uncertain records which have reached us, the views he presented
were what are called evangelical, though highly imbued with the claims of the Papal Church.
He described the creation of man, his fall, the atonement by the crucifixion of the Son of
God, his ascension, leaving Peter and his successors, as his vicegerents upon earth. Invested
with this divine power, one of his successors, the present Pope, had commissioned Pizarro to
visit Peru, to conquer and convert the natives to the true faith.

The Inca listened attentively to the arguments of the priest, but was apparently unmoved by
them. He calmly replied:

"I acknowledge that there is but one God, the maker of all things. As for the Pope, I know
him not. He must be insane to give away that which does not belong to him. The king of Spain
is doubtless a great monarch, and I wish to make him my friend, but I cannot become his vassal."

A few more words were interchanged, when the priest returned into the stone fortress, where
Pizarro stood surrounded by his soldiers. The priest reported the conversation which had taken
place; declared that the Inca, in the pride of his heart, had rejected Christianity. He therefore
announced to Pizarro that he was authorized by the divine law, to make war upon the Inca and
his people.

"Go set on them at once," said he; "spare them not; kill these dogs which so stubbornly despise
the law of God. I absolve you."

    "There were two great objects in view in this massacre. One
    was to strike terror into the heart of the Peruvians; the
    other was to obtain possession of the person of the Inca. It
    seems that the nobles regarded their sovereign with almost
    idolatrous homage. They rallied thickly around him, placed
    their own bodies between him and the sabres of their
    assailants, and made frantic endeavors to tear the cavaliers
    from their saddles. Unfortunately they were unarmed, and had
    neither arrows, javelins nor war clubs. The Inca sat helpless
    in his palanquin, quite bewildered by the awful storm of war
    which had thus suddenly burst around him. In the swaying of
    the mighty mass, the litter heaved to and fro, like a ship in
    a storm."

At length several of the nobles who supported it being slain, the palanquin was overthrown,
and the Inca, as he was falling to the ground, was caught by the Spaniards. In the confusion
of the affray, Pizarro was slightly wounded in the hand by one of his own men. This was the
only hurt received by any Spaniard during the bloody affray.

The Inca being captured, the conflict in the square ceased. But there was another object in
view, as has been stated, and that was to strike terror into the hearts of the Peruvians. Consequently
the steel-clad cavaliers pursued the fugitives in all directions, cutting them down without
mercy. Night, which followed the short twilight of the tropics, put an end to the carnage,
and the trumpets of Pizarro recalled the soldiers, wiping their dripping sabres, to their fortress.
The number slain is variously estimated. The secretary of Pizarro says that two thousand fell.
A Peruvian annalist swells the number of victims to ten thousand.

Attahuallapa, the monarch of the great kingdom of Peru, thus suddenly found himself a prisoner
in one of his own fortresses; surrounded by a band of stern warriors, who had penetrated the
heart of his empire from a distance of more than two thousand leagues. Pizarro treated the
unhappy king with respect, and testifies to the dignity with which he met his awful reverses.
What part De Soto took in the outrages just described, cannot now be known. He had unquestionably
in good faith, and as an honorable man, invited the Inca to visit Caxamarca, by which invitation
he had been enticed into the power of the Spaniards.

There is evidence that De Soto had no idea of the treachery which was intended, for it was
not until after he had left on his visit to the Peruvian camp that the plot was formed for
the seizure of the Inca. Pizarro had two bodies of horsemen. One was commanded by his brother
Hernando, and the other by De Soto. There were thirty dragoons in each band. Unquestionably,
Hernando was a very eager participant in the horrors of this day. It may be that De Soto, from
the roof of the fortress, was an inactive spectator of the scene. It does not seem possible
that with the character he had heretofore developed, he could have lent his own strong arm
and those of his horsemen to the perpetration of a crime so atrocious. Still military discipline
is a terrible power. It sears the conscience and hardens the heart. The fact that De Soto was
present and that there are no evidences of remonstrances on his part, has left a stigma upon
his character which time cannot efface.

The next morning these Spaniards, so zealous for the propagation of the Christian faith, unmindful
of their professed Christian mission, betook themselves, with all alacrity, to the work of
pillage. The golden throne, and the royal wardrobe, were of very great value. The nobles were
clad in their richest garments of state, and the ground was strewn with bodies of the dead,
glittering in robes of gold and gems. Having stripped the dead, they then entered the houses
and temples of Caxamarca and loaded themselves down with golden vases, and other booty of great
value. As one suggestive item, which reveals the conduct of these brutal men, the good Las
Casas states, that a Spanish soldier seized a young Peruvian girl. When the mother rushed to
rescue her child, he cut off her arm with his sword, and then in his rage hewed the maiden
to pieces.

Pizarro now assumed the proud title of "The Conqueror of Peru." With the sovereign as his prisoner,
and elated by his great victory, he felt that there was no resistance that he had to fear.
It seems that Attahuallapa had penetration enough to discern that De Soto was a very different
man in character from the Pizarros. He soon became quite cordial and unreserved in his intercourse
with him. And there is no evidence that De Soto ever, in the slightest degree, betrayed his
confidence. One day the Inca inquired of De Soto for what amount of ransom Pizarro would be
willing to release him. De Soto was well aware of the timidity and avarice of the captain.
The love of the Peruvians for their sovereign was such, that Pizarro was confident that so
long as Attahuallapa was in his power, they would not make war upon him. De Soto felt therefore
that there was no prospect that Pizarro would release his captive for any ransom whatever,
and sadly advised him to resign all such hope. The Inca was greatly distressed. After a few
moments of silence, he said:

"My friend, do not deprive me of the only hope that can make life supportable. I must be free,
or I must die. Your commander loves gold above all things. Surely I can purchase my liberty
from him at some price, and however unreasonable it may be, I am willing to satisfy his demand.
Tell me, I entreat of you, what sum you think will be sufficient?"

For a moment De Soto made no reply. They were sitting in a room, according to the statement
of Pizarro's secretary, twenty-two feet long and seventeen feet broad. Then turning to the
Inca, and wishing to impress his mind with the conviction that there was not any ransom which
could effect his release, he said:

"If you could fill this room with gold as high as I can reach with my sword, Pizarro might
perhaps accept it as your ransom."

"It shall be done," the Inca eagerly replied. "And I beg you to let Pizarro know, that within
a month from this day, my part of the contract shall be fulfilled."

De Soto was troubled, for he had not intended that as an offer, but rather as a statement of
an impossibility. He however felt bound to report the proposition to Pizarro. Much to his surprise
the avaricious captain readily accepted it. The contract was drawn up, and Pizarro gave his
solemn pledge that upon the delivery of the gold the prison doors of the captive should be
thrown open. But after the terms had all been settled, the perfidious Spaniard craved a still
higher ransom, and declared that he would not release his victim unless another room of equal
size was equally filled with silver.

Attahuallapa could fully appreciate such dishonorable conduct; for in all moral qualities he
seems to have been decidedly superior to his Spanish antagonist. But without any undignified
murmurs, he submitted to this extortion also. Matters being thus arranged, De Soto, with his
characteristic plain dealing, said to Pizarro:

"I hope you will remember, Don Francisco, that my honor is pledged for the strict fulfilment
of the contract on the part of the Spaniards. Observe, therefore, that as soon as the gold
and the silver are produced, Attahuallapa must have his liberty."

Pizarro gave his most solemn pledges, on his Christian faith, that so soon as the money was
paid the Inca should be released. The idea does not seem to have entered the mind of Attahuallapa
that Pizarro could be guilty of the perfidy of violating those pledges. The unhappy condition
of the Inca excited the strong sympathies of De Soto. He visited him often, and having a natural
facility for the acquisition of language, was soon able to converse with the captive in his
own tongue. Quite a friendship, founded on mutual esteem, sprang up between them. By his strong
intercession, Pizarro was constrained to consent that the gold should not be melted into ingots,
thus to fill the designated space with its solid bulk, but that it should be received and packed
away in the form of vases, and ornaments, and other manufactured articles, as brought in by
the Peruvians.

Several of the principal officers of Attahuallapa's court were sent to Cuzco, the capital of
the empire, where the main treasures of the kingdom were deposited. Three Spaniards accompanied
these officers. The Inca issued his orders that they should be treated with respect. The people
obeyed; for they knew that any injury or insult befalling the Spaniards would bring down terrible
retribution upon their beloved sovereign. Peruvian agents were also dispatched to all the temples
to strip them of their ornaments, and to the homes of the nobility to receive the plate and
golden decorations which were eagerly contributed as ransom for the king. The cornices and
entablatures of the temples were often of solid gold, and massive plates of gold encrusted
the walls. For several weeks there seemed to be a constant procession of Peruvians entering
the fortress, laden with golden vases and innumerable other utensils, often of exquisite workmanship.

Within the allotted time the ransom, enormous as it was, was all brought in. It is estimated
that its value was equal to about twenty million dollars of our money. The Inca now demanded
his release. The infamous Pizarro had perhaps originally intended to set him at liberty. But
he had now come to the conclusion that the Inca might immediately rally around him, not only
his whole army, but the whole population of the kingdom, cut off the retreat of the Spaniards,
exterminate them, and win back all the plunder so unrighteously extorted. Pizarro was consequently
plotting for some plausible excuse for putting the monarch to death. The Peruvians thus deprived
of their sovereign, and in a state of bewilderment, would be thrown into anarchy, and the Spaniards
would have a much better chance of obtaining entire possession of the kingdom.

Pizarro did not dare to reveal to De Soto his treasonable designs. He feared not only his reproaches,
but his determined and very formidable resistance. He therefore gave it as an excuse for postponing
the liberation of the Inca, that he must wait until he had made a division of the spoils. The
distribution was performed with imposing religious ceremonies. Mass was celebrated, and earnest
prayers were addressed to Heaven that the work might be so performed as to meet the approbation
of God. A fifth part of the plunder was set apart for the king of Spain, the Emperor, Charles
the Fifth. Pizarro, as commander of the expedition, came next, and his share amounted to millions.
De Soto was defrauded, not receiving half so much as Hernando Pizarro. Still, his share in
this distribution and in another which soon took place, amounted to over five hundred thousand
dollars. This was an enormous sum in those days. It elevated him at once, in point of opulence,
to the rank of the proudest grandees of Spain.

The great object of De Soto's ambition was accomplished. He had acquired fame and wealth beyond
his most sanguine expectations. Thus he was prepared to return to Spain and demand the hand
of Isabella. But his generous nature was troubled. He became very anxious for the fate of the
Inca. His own honor was involved in his release, and day after day he became more importunate
in his expostulations with Pizarro.

"Whatever the consequences may be," said De Soto, "the Inca must now be immediately set at
liberty. He has your promise to that effect and he has mine; and my promise, come what will,
shall not be violated."

Pizarro urged, in view of their peril, the delay of a few weeks. De Soto replied:

"Not a single week, not a day; if you do not liberate the prisoner, I will take that liberty
on myself."

"To give him his freedom at this time," Pizarro replied, "would be certain destruction to us all."

"That may be," responded De Soto, "but that should have been considered before he was admitted
to ransom."

"But since that agreement was made," said Pizarro, "I have received information which justifies
me in changing my intentions. Attahuallapa's officers, acting under his directions, are now
engaged in exciting an insurrection for the extermination of the Spaniards."

De Soto had no faith whatever in this accusation. There was a long and angry controversy. Pizarro
called in his interpreter Filipillo, who was undoubtedly bribed to testify according to the
wishes of his master. He declared that the Inca was organizing this conspiracy. De Soto was
unconvinced. He still regarded the accusation as a groundless calumny.

Finally they came to a compromise. The treacherous and wily Pizarro suggested that De Soto
should take a party of dragoons and proceed to that section of the country, where it was said
the conspirators were assembling in vast numbers, in preparation for their onset upon the Spaniards.
If De Soto found no indication of such a movement, Pizarro gave his solemn pledge, that immediately
upon his return, he would release Attahuallapa. De Soto agreed to the arrangement, and at once
set out on the journey.

Pizarro had thus accomplished his object, of being relieved of the embarrassment of De Soto's
presence, while he should lead the Inca to his execution. A sort of council of war was held,
though Attahuallapa was not present, and nothing was heard in his defence. It was necessary
to proceed with the utmost expedition, as De Soto would soon return. The horrible verdict of
the court was, that the captive should be burned to death at the stake. Pizarro himself, it
is said, carried the terrible intelligence to the prisoner.

The Inca, a young man in the very prime of life, being but thirty years of age, was horror
stricken, and for some time sat in silence, not uttering a word. And then turning to Pizarro,
he said:

"Is it possible that you can believe in a God and fear him, and yet dare to commit such an
act of injustice? What have I done to deserve death in any form, and why have you condemned
me to a death so unusual and painful. Surely you cannot intend to execute this cruel sentence."

Pizarro assured him that the decree of the court was unalterable, and must immediately be carried
into effect.

"Think of the wrong you have already done me," said the Inca, "and do not forget how much you
are indebted to my kindness and forbearance. I could easily have intercepted you in the mountain
passes, and made you all prisoners, or sacrificed you all justly to the offended laws of my
country. I could have overpowered you with my armed warriors at Caxamarca. But I failed in
my duty to my people in receiving you as friends. You have robbed me of my kingdom and compelled
me to insult my Deity, by stripping his temples to satisfy your avarice.

"Of all my possessions, you have left me nothing but my life, and that I supposed you would
be willing to spare me, since you can gain nothing by taking it away. Consider how hard it
is for me to die, so suddenly and without any warning of my danger. I have lived but thirty
years, and until very lately, I had every reason to hope for a long and happy life. My prospects
for happiness are blighted forever. But I will not complain of that, if you will permit me
to live out the term which God and nature have allotted me."

The execution was to take place immediately. Pizarro waited only for the sun to go down, that
darkness might shroud the fiendlike deed. As they were talking Pizarro's chaplain, Friar Vincent,
came in to prepare the victim for the sacrifice. He was dressed in his ecclesiastical robes,
and bore in his hand a large crucifix. Was he an unmitigated knave, or was he a fanatic? Who
but God can tell.

"It is time for you," said he, "to withdraw your thoughts from earthly vanities and fix them
upon the realities of the eternal world. You are justly condemned to death, for your infidelity
and other sins. I call on you to accept the free gift of salvation which I now offer you, so
that you may escape the greater punishment of eternal fire."

The Inca seemed to pay little heed to these words, but with a gesture of impatience and anger,
exclaimed:

"Oh, where is De Soto? He is a good man, and he is my friend. Surely he will not allow me to
be thus murdered."

"De Soto," the priest replied, "is far away. No earthly help can avail you. Receive the consolations
of the Church; kiss the feet of this image, and I will absolve you from your sins, and prepare
you to enter the kingdom of Heaven."

"I worship the Maker of all things," the Inca firmly replied. "As much as I desire to live,
I will not forsake the faith of my fathers to prolong my life."

Two hours after sunset, the sound of the trumpet assembled the Spanish soldiers by torchlight
in the great square of Caxamarca. It was the evening of the twenty-ninth of August, 1533. The
clanking of chains was heard as the victim, manacled hand and foot, toiled painfully over the
stone pavement of the square. He was bound by chains to the stake; the combustible fagots were
piled up around him. Friar Vincent then, it is said, holding up the cross before the victim,
told him that if he would embrace Christianity he should be spared the cruel death by the flames,
and experience in its stead only the painless death of the garotte, and that the Inca did,
while thus chained to the stake, abjure his religion and receive the rite of baptism. In reference
to this representation Mr. Lambert A. Wilmer, in his admirable life of Ferdinand De Soto, says:

     "As the traducers of the dead Inca were permitted to tell
     their own story without fear of contradiction, it is
     impossible to assign any limits to their fabrications. And
     their testimony is probable, only when it tends to criminate
     themselves. Perhaps the greatest injustice which these
     slanderers have done to Attahuallapa's memory, was by
     pretending that he became an apostate to his own religion
     and a convert to Catholicism just before his death.

     "If this story were true, how could Pizarro justify himself,
     or how could the Pope and the king of Spain excuse him for
     putting a Christian to death on account of sins committed by
     an infidel. Surely the royal penitent, when he entered the
     pale of the Holy Catholic Church, would be entitled to a
     free pardon for those errors of conduct which were
     incidental to his unregenerate condition. We are told that
     when the Inca had consented to be baptized by Father
     Vincent, Pizarro graciously commuted his sentence, and
     allowed him to be strangled before his body was reduced to
     ashes."

These fictions were doubtless contrived to illustrate Pizarro's clemency, and Father Vincent's
apostolic success.

The probability is, as others state, that the Inca remained firm to the end; the torch was
applied, and while the consuming flames wreathed around him, he uttered no cry. In this chariot
of fire the spirit of this deeply outraged man was borne to the judgment of God.

De Soto soon returned. He was almost frantic with indignation when he learned of the crime
which had been perpetrated in his absence, and perceived that his mission was merely an artifice
to get him out of the way. His rage blazed forth in the most violent reproaches. Hastening
to the tent of Pizarro, he rudely pushed aside a sentinel who guarded the entrance, and found
the culprit seated on a low stool, affecting the attitude of a mourner. A large slouched hat
was bent over his eyes.

"Uncover yourself;" said De Soto, "unless you are ashamed to look a human being in the face."
Then with the point of his sword he struck off his hat, exclaiming:

"Is it not enough that I have disgraced myself in the eyes of the world by becoming your companion
and confederate, making myself accessory to your crimes, and protecting you from the punishment
you deserve. Have you not heaped infamy enough upon me, without dishonoring me by the violation
of my pledges, and exposing me to the suspicion of being connected with the most cruel and
causeless murder that ever set human laws and divine justice at defiance? I have ascertained,
what you well knew before I left Caxamarca, that the report of the insurrection was utterly
false. I have met nothing on the road but demonstrations of good will. The whole country is
quiet, and Attahuallapa has been basely slandered. You, Francisco Pizarro, are his slanderer,
and you are his murderer.

"To prove that I have had no participation in the deed, I will make you accountable for his
death. Craven and prevaricating villain as you are, you shall not escape this responsibility.
If you refuse to meet me in honorable combat, I will denounce you to the king of Spain as a
criminal, and will proclaim you to the whole world as a coward and an assassin."

Pizarro was both, an assassin and a coward. He stood in awe of his intrepid lieutenant. He
did not dare to meet him in a personal rencontre, and he well knew that De Soto was not a man
to be taken by force or guile, as he could immediately rally around him the whole body of his
well-drilled dragoons. He therefore began to make excuses, admitted that he had acted hastily,
and endeavored to throw the blame upon others, declaring that by their false representations
they had forced him to the act.

In the midst of the dispute, Pizarro's brothers--for there were two in the camp--entered the
tent. De Soto, addressing the three, said:

"I am the champion of Attahuallapa. I accuse Francisco Pizarro of being his murderer." Then
throwing his glove upon the floor, he continued:

"I invite any man who is disposed to deny that Francisco Pizarro is a coward and an assassin,
to take it up."

The glove remained untouched. De Soto turned upon his heel contemptuously, and left the tent,
resolved, it is said, no longer to have any connection whatever with such perfidious wretches.
He immediately resigned his commission as lieutenant-general and announced his determination
to return to Spain. But alas, for human frailty and inconsistency, he was to take with him
the five hundred thousand dollars of treasure of which the Peruvians had been ruthlessly despoiled.
Perhaps he reasoned with himself,

"What can I do with it. The Inca is dead. It would not be wise to throw it into the streets,
and I surely am not bound to contribute it to the already enormous wealth of Pizarro."

Another source of embarrassment arose. Reinforcements to the number of two hundred men had
just arrived at Caxamarca, under Almagro. They had been sent forward from Panama, commissioned
by the king of Spain to join the enterprise. The whole number of Spanish soldiers, assembled
in the heart of the Peruvian empire, now amounted to about five hundred. Mountain ridges rose
between them and the sea-coast, in whose almost impassable defiles a few hundred resolute men
might arrest the advance of an army. The Peruvians had a standing force of fifty thousand soldiers.
The whole population of the country was roused to the highest pitch of indignation. They were
everywhere grasping their arms. Nothing but the most consummate prudence could rescue the Spaniards
from their perilous position. The danger was imminent, that they would be utterly exterminated.

For De Soto, under these circumstances, to abandon his comrades, and retire from the field,
would seem an act of cowardice. He had no confidence in the ability of the Pizarros to rescue
the Spaniards. He therefore judged that duty to his king and his countrymen demanded of him
that he should remain in Peru, until he could leave the army in a safe condition.

Pizarro did not venture to resent the reproaches and defiance of De Soto, but immediately prepared
to avail himself of his military abilities, in a march of several hundred miles south to Cuzco,
the capital of the empire. With characteristic treachery, Pizarro seized one of the most distinguished
nobles of the Peruvian court, and held him as a hostage. This nobleman, named Chalcukima, had
occupied some of the highest posts of honor in the kingdom, and was greatly revered and beloved
by the Peruvians. Pizarro sent far and wide the announcement, that upon the slightest movement
of hostility on the part of the natives, Chalcukima would be put to death.

The Spaniards now set out on their long march. It was in the month of September, 1533, one
of the most lovely months in that attractive clime. But for the rapine, carnage and violence
of war, such a tour through the enchanting valley of the Cordilleras, in the midst of fruits
and flowers, and bird songs, and traversing populous villages inhabited by a gentle and amiable
people, would have been an enterprise full of enjoyment. But the path of these demoniac men
was marked by the ravages of fiends. And notwithstanding the great embarrassments in which
De Soto found himself involved, it is very difficult to find any excuse for him, in allowing
himself to be one of their number.

Francisco Pizarro led the band. His brother Hernando, De Soto, and Almagro, were his leading
captains. But it was the genius of De Soto alone, with his highly disciplined dragoons, which
conducted the enterprise to a successful issue. He led the advance; he was always sent to every
point of danger; his sword opened the path, through which Pizarro followed with his vagabond
and plundering crew.

In trembling solicitude for his own safety, Pizarro not only held Chalcukima as a hostage,
but he also seized upon Topaxpa, the young, feeble and grief-stricken son of the murdered Attahuallapa,
and declared him to be, by legitimate right, the successor to the throne. Thus he still had
the Inca in his power. The Peruvians were still accustomed to regard the Inca with almost religious
homage. Topaxpa was compelled to issue such commands as Pizarro gave to him. Thus an additional
element of embarrassment was thrown into the ranks of the Peruvians. Communication between
different parts of the empire was extremely difficult and slow. There were no mails and no
horses. This gave the mounted Spaniards a vast advantage over their bewildered victims.

For several days the Spanish army moved delightfully along, through a series of luxuriant valleys,
where the secluded people had scarcely heard of their arrival in the country. The movement
of the glittering host was one of the most wonderful pageants which Peruvian eyes had ever
beheld. A multitude of men, women and children, thronged the highway, gazing with curiosity
and admiration upon the scene, and astonished by the clatter of the hoofs of the horses upon
the flag-stones, with which the national road was so carefully paved. During these few days
of peaceful travel the natives presented no opposition to the march, and the presence of De
Soto seemed to restrain the whole army from deeds of ruffianly violence. Whenever Pizarro wished
to engage in any of his acts of villany, he was always careful first to send De Soto away on
some important mission.

They were now approaching a deep and rapid mountain stream, where the bridge had either been
carried away by the recent flood or had been destroyed by the Peruvians. They were also informed
that quite a large army was gathered upon the opposite bank to arrest, with the aid of the
rushing torrent, the farther advance of the Spaniards. Pizarro immediately ordered a halt.
De Soto, with a hundred horsemen, was sent forward to reconnoitre, and, if possible, to open
the path. Almagro, with two hundred footmen, followed closely behind to support the cavalry.

De Soto, without paying much attention to his infantry allies, pressed so rapidly forward as
soon to leave them far behind. He reached the river. It was a swollen mountain torrent. Several
thousand natives, brandishing their javelins and their war clubs, stood upon the opposite bank
of the stream. De Soto and his horsemen, without a moment's hesitation, plunged into the stream,
and some by swimming and some by fording, soon crossed the foaming waters. As the war horses,
with their steel-clad riders, came rushing upon the Peruvians, their keen swords flashing in
the sunlight, a large part of the army fled in great terror. It seemed to them that supernatural
foes had descended for their destruction.

A few remained, and fought with the energies of despair. But they were powerless before the
trampling horses and the sharp weapons of their foes. They were cut down mercilessly, and it
was the genius of De Soto which guided in the carnage, and the strong arm of De Soto which
led in the bloody fray. And we must not forget that these Peruvians were fighting for their
lives, their liberty, their all; and that these Spaniards were ruthless invaders. Neither can
we greatly admire the heroism displayed by the assailants. The man who is carefully gloved
and masked can with impunity rob the bees of their honey. The wolf does not need much courage
to induce him to leap into the fold of the lambs.

In the vicinity of this routed army there was a pagan temple; that is, a temple dedicated to
the Sun, the emblem of the God of the Peruvians. It was in those days thought that the heathen
and all their possessions, rightly belonged to the Christians; that it was the just desert
of the pagans to be plundered and put to death. Even the mind of De Soto was so far in accord
with these infamous doctrines of a benighted age, that he allowed his troopers to plunder the
temple of all its rich treasures of silver and of gold. A very large amount of booty was thus
obtained. One of the principal ornaments of this temple was an artificial sun, of large size,
composed of pure and solid gold.

Mr. Wilmer, speaking of this event, judiciously remarks:

     "De Soto, finding his path once more unobstructed, pushed
     forward, evidently disposed to open the way to Cuzco without
     the assistance of his tardy and irresolute commander. It is
     a remarkable fact, and one which admits of no denial, that
     every important military movement of the Spaniards in Peru,
     until the final subjugation of the empire by the capture of
     the metropolis, was conducted by De Soto. Up to the time to
     which our narrative now refers, Pizarro had never fought a
     single battle which deserved the name. The bloody tragedy of
     Caxamarca, it will be remembered, was only massacre; the
     contrivance and execution of which required no military
     skill and no soldier-like courage. Pizarro acquired the
     mastery of Peru by the act of a malefactor. And he was, in
     fact, a thief and not a conqueror. The heroic element of
     this conquest is represented by the actions of De Soto."

Considering the relations which existed between De Soto and Pizarro, it is not improbable that
each was glad to be released from the presence of the other. It is very certain that so soon
as De Soto was gone, Pizarro, instead of hurrying forward to support him in the hazardous encounters
to which he was exposed, immediately engaged, with the main body of his army, in plundering
all the mansions of the wealthy and the temples on their line of march. And it is equally certain
that De Soto, instead of waiting for the troops of Pizarro to come up, put spurs to his horse
and pressed on, as if he were anxious to place as great a distance as possible between himself
and his superior in command.

Though De Soto had allowed his troops to plunder the temple of Xauxa, he would allow no robbery
of private dwellings, and rigidly prohibited the slightest act of violence or injustice towards
the persons of the natives.

It will be remembered that Pizarro had threatened to hold Chalcukima responsible for any act
of hostility on the part of the Peruvians. He now summoned his captive before him, and charged
him with treason; accusing him of having incited his countrymen to measures of resistance.
Chalcukima, with dignity and firmness which indicate a noble character, replied:

"If it had been possible for me to communicate with the people, I should certainly have advised
them to do their duty to their country, without any regard to my personal safety. But you well
know that the vigilance with which you have guarded me, has prevented me from making any communication
of the kind. I am sorry that it has not been in my power to be guilty of the fact with which
you charge me."

The wretched Pizarro, utterly incapable of appreciating the grandeur of such a character, ordered
him to be burned at the stake. The fanatic robber and murderer, insulting the cross of Christ,
by calling himself a Christian, sent his private chaplain, Friar Vincent, to convert Chalcukima
to what he called the Christian faith. The priest gave an awful description of the glooms of
hell, to which the prisoner was destined as a heathen. In glowing colors he depicted the splendors
of the celestial Eden, to which he would be admitted the moment after his execution if he would
accept the Christian faith. The captive coldly replied:

"I do not understand your religion, and all that I have seen of it does not impress me in its
favor."

He was led to the stake. Not a cry escaped his lips, as the fierce flames consumed his quivering
flesh. From that scene of short, sharp agony, we trust that his spirit ascended to be folded
in the embrace of his Heavenly Father. It is a fundamental principle in the teachings of Jesus,
that in every nation he that feareth God, and doeth righteousness, is accepted of him. But
God's ways here on earth are indeed past all finding out. Perhaps the future will solve the
dreadful mystery, but at present, as we contemplate man's inhumanity to man, our eyes are often
blinded with tears, and our hearts sink despairingly within us.

De Soto pressed rapidly onwards, league after league, over sublime eminences and through luxuriant
vales. The road was admirable: smooth and clean as a floor. It was constructed only for foot
passengers, as the Peruvians had no animals larger than the lama or sheep. This advance-guard
of the Spanish army, all well mounted, and inspired by the energies of their impetuous chief,
soon reached a point where the road led over a mountain by steps cut in the solid rock, steep
as a flight of stairs. Precipitous cliffs rose hundreds of feet on either side. Here it was
necessary for the troopers to dismount, and carefully to lead their horses by the bit up the
difficult ascent.

The road was winding and irregular, leading through the most savage scenery. This pass, at
its summit, opened upon smooth table-land, luxuriant and beautiful under the influence of a
tropical sun and mountain showers and dews. About half way up this pass, upon almost inaccessible
crags, several thousand Peruvians had assembled to make another attempt at resistance. Arrows
and javelins were of but little avail. Indeed they always rebounded from the armor of the Spaniards
as from the ledges of eternal rock.

But the natives had abundantly provided themselves with enormous stones to roll down upon the
heads of men and horses. Quite a band of armed men were also assembled upon the open plain
at the head of the pass. As the Spaniards were almost dragging their horses up the gorge, suddenly
the storm of war burst upon them. Showers of stone descended from the cliff from thousands
of unseen hands. Huge boulders were pried over and went thundering down, crashing all opposition
before them. It seems now incomprehensible why the whole squadron of horsemen was not destroyed.
But in this awful hour the self-possession of De Soto did not for one moment forsake him. He
shouted to his men:

"If we halt here, or attempt to go back, we must certainly perish. Our only safety is in pressing
forward. As soon as we reach the top of the pass, we can easily put these men to flight."

Suiting his action to his words, and being at the head of his men, he pushed forward with almost
frantic energy, carefully watching and avoiding the descending missiles. Though several horses
and many men were killed, and others sorely wounded, the majority soon reached the head of
the pass. They then had an unobstructed plain before them, over which their horses could gallop
in any direction at their utmost speed.

Impetuously they fell upon the band collected there, who wielded only the impotent weapons
of arrows, javelins and war clubs. The Spaniards, exasperated by the death of their comrades,
and by their own wounds, took desperate vengeance. No quarter was shown. Their sabres dripped
with blood. Few could escape the swift-footed steeds. The dead were trampled beneath iron hoofs.
Night alone ended the carnage.

During the night the Peruvians bravely rallied from their wide dispersion over the mountains,
resolved in their combined force to make another attempt to resist their foes. They were conscious
that should they fail here, their case was hopeless.

At the commencement of the conflict a courier had been sent back, by De Soto, to urge Almagro
to push forward his infantry as rapidly as possible. By a forced march they pressed on through
the hours of the night, almost upon the run. The early dawn brought them to the pass. Soon
the heart of De Soto was cheered as he heard their bugle blasts reverberating among the cliffs
of the mountains. Their banners appeared emerging from the defile, and two hundred well-armed
men joined his ranks.

Though the Peruvians were astonished at this accession to the number of their foes, they still
came bravely forward to the battle. It was another scene of slaughter for the poor Peruvians.
They inflicted but little harm upon the Spaniards, while hundreds of their slain soon strewed
the ground.

The Spanish infantry, keeping safely beyond the reach of arrow or javelin, could, with the
deadly bullet, bring down a Peruvian as fast as they could load and fire, while the horsemen
could almost with impunity plunge into the densest ranks of the foe. The Peruvians were vanquished,
dispersed, and cut down, until the Spaniards even were weary with carnage. This was the most
important battle which was fought in the conquest of Peru.

The field was but twenty-five miles from the capital, to which the army could now advance by
an almost unobstructed road. De Soto was anxious to press on immediately and take possession
of the city. He however yielded to the earnest entreaties of Almagro, and consented to remain
where he was with his band of marauders. This delay, in a military point of view, proved to
be very unfortunate. Had they gone immediately forward, the vanquished and panic-stricken Peruvians
would not have ventured upon another encounter. But Almagro was the friend of Pizarro, dependent
upon him, and had been his accomplice in many a deed of violence. He was anxious that Pizarro
should have the renown of a conqueror, and should enjoy the triumph of riding at the head of
his troops into the streets of the vanquished capital.

This delay of several days gave the Peruvians time to recover from their consternation, and
they organized another formidable line of defense in a valley which the Spaniards would be
compelled to traverse, a few miles from the city. Pizarro was still several miles in the rear.
De Soto dispatched a courier to him, informing him of the new encounter to which the army was
exposed, and stating that the Peruvians were well posted, and that every hour of delay added
to their strength. Still Pizarro loitered behind; still Almagro expressed his decided reluctance
to advance before Pizarro's arrival. To add to De Soto's embarrassments, he declared that De
Soto was acting without authority and in direct opposition to the orders of his superior. After
a little hesitancy De Soto resolved to take the responsibility and to advance. He said to Almagro:

"A soldier who is entrusted with an important command, is not bound in all cases to await the
orders of his superior. Where there is manifestly an important advantage to be gained, he must
be allowed to act according to his own discretion."

He then appealed to his own dragoons, saying to them:

"The whole success of our expedition now depends upon the celerity of our movements. While
we are waiting for Pizarro, our best chance for victory will be lost."

With one united voice the dragoons of De Soto demanded to be led forward. Availing himself
of this enthusiasm, De Soto put his troops in motion. The Peruvians were a few miles in advance,
strongly posted in a deep and rugged ravine, where they hoped that the movements of the horses
would be so impeded that they could accomplish but little. They pressed forward, and the battle
was immediately commenced. Both parties fought with great fury. In the midst of the conflict
a large reinforcement of the natives came rushing upon the field, under the leadership of a
young Peruvian noble, who displayed truly chivalric courage and energy. De Soto was ever where
the blows fell thickest and where danger was most imminent.

Quite a number of the Peruvians were slain, and many dead horses were strewed over the field.
At one time De Soto, separated from his comrades by the surging tides of the battle, found
himself surrounded by twenty Peruvians, who, with arrows, javelins and battle clubs, assailed
him with the utmost impetuosity. Javelins and arrows glanced harmless from the Spanish armor.
But war clubs, armed with copper and wielded by sinewy arms, were formidable weapons even for
the belted knight to encounter. De Soto, with his keen and ponderous sword, cut his way through
his assailants, strewing the ground with the dead. The young Peruvian, who, it is said, was
heir to the throne of the Inca, had assumed the general command.

He gazed with astonishment upon the exploits of De Soto, and said in despairing tones to his
attendants: "It is useless to contend with such enemies! These men are destined to be our masters."

Immediately he approached De Soto, throwing down his arms, advancing alone, and indicating
by gestures that he was ready to surrender. The battle at once ceased, and most of the Peruvian
army rushed precipitately back towards the city. In a state of frenzy they applied the torch
in all directions, resolved to thwart the avarice of the conqueror by laying the whole city
and all its treasures in ashes. The inhabitants of Cuzco, almost without exception, fled. Each
one seized upon whatever of value could be carried away. Volumes of smoke and the bursting
flames soon announced to the Spaniards the doom of the city.

De Soto and his dragoons put spurs to their horses and hastened forward, hoping to extinguish
the conflagration. Now that the battle was fought and the victory won, Francisco Pizarro, with
his band of miscreants, came rushing on to seize the plunder.

     "They came like wolves or jackals to fatten on the prey
     which never could have been attained by their own courage or
     prowess. The disappointment of Pizarro and his congenial
     associates, when they found that the principal wealth of the
     city had been carried off by the Peruvians, vented itself in
     acts of diabolical cruelty. They seized on the aged and sick
     persons who had been unable to escape, and put many of them
     to the torture to make them confess where the treasures of
     Cuzco were concealed. Either these unfortunate people could
     not give the information required, or they had sufficient
     firmness to endure agony and death rather than betray the
     consecrated treasures of their national monuments and altars
     into the hands of their enemies."[A]

[Footnote A: Life of Ferdinand De Soto, by Lambert A. Wilmer, p. 272.]

It was late in the afternoon of a November day, 1533, when the dragoons of De Soto, closely
followed by the whole Spanish army, entered the burning streets of Cuzco. They ran about eagerly
in all directions searching for gold in the blazing palaces and temples. Thus an immense amount
of spoil was found, which the Peruvians had been unable to remove. It is said that after one-fifth
had been subtracted for the Spanish crown, and the officers had received their abundant shares,
the common soldiers, four hundred and eighty in number, received each one a sum amounting to
four thousand dollars.

Peru was conquered, but the victors had indeed gained a loss. Nearly all who were engaged in
the enterprise perished miserably. Almagro was eventually taken captive by the Peruvians and
strangled. Hernando Pizarro, returning to Spain, languished for weary years in a prison. The
younger brother was beheaded. Friar Vincent, who had given the support of religion to many
of the most atrocious of these crimes, fell into an ambush with a small party, and they all
were massacred. Francisco Pizarro himself fell a victim to a conspiracy among his own soldiers,
and at mid-day was put to death in his own palace. But we must leave these wild men to their
career of cruelty and crime, while we follow the footsteps of De Soto.

Early in the year 1534, De Soto took leave of his comrades in Peru, and embarked for Spain.
He had left his native land in poverty. He now returned after an absence of about fifteen years,
greatly enriched, prepared in opulence as well as in illustrious birth to take his stand with
the proudest grandees of that then opulent realm. His last labors in Peru were spent in unavailing
endeavors to humanize the spirit of his countrymen there, and to allay the bitter feuds which
were springing up among them. But his departure seemed to remove from them all restraints,
and Spaniards and Peruvians alike were whelmed in a common ruin.

No account has been transmitted to us of De Soto's return voyage. While he was in Peru, Don
Pedro had died. His sick-bed was a scene of lingering agony, both of body and of mind. The
proud spirit is sometimes vanquished and crushed by remorse; but it is never, by those scorpion
lashes, subdued, and rendered humble and gentle and lovable. The dying sinner, whose soul was
crimsoned with guilt, was overwhelmed with "a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
indignation." The ecclesiastics, who surrounded his death-bed, assured him that such sins as
he had been guilty of could only be expiated by the most liberal benefactions to the church.
He had never forgiven Isabella for her pertinacious adherence to De Soto. In the grave he could
not prohibit their nuptials. By bequeathing his wealth to the church, he could accomplish a
double object. He could gratify his revenge by leaving his daughter penniless, and thus De
Soto, if he continued faithful, would be compelled to receive to his arms a dowerless bride;
and a miserable superstition taught him that he could thus bribe God to throw open to him the
gates of paradise.

Don Pedro's eldest daughter, Maria, was engaged to be married to Vasco Nuñez, the very worthy
governor who had preceded Don Pedro at Darien, and whom he had so infamously beheaded. She
had spent fifteen years in her father's castle in the gloom and tears of this cruel widowhood.
Don Pedro bequeathed nearly all his fortune to the endowment of a monastery, over which Maria
was appointed abbess. Isabella was left unprovided for. Thus suddenly the relative position
of the two lovers was entirely changed. De Soto found himself in possession of large wealth.
Isabella was reduced to poverty. We know not where to find, in the annals of history, the record
of a more beautiful attachment than that which, during fifteen years of separation, trial,
and sorest temptations, had united the hearts of De Soto and Isabella. Their love commenced
when they were children, walking hand in hand, and playing in the bowers of Don Pedro's ancestral
castle.

De Soto had now attained the age of thirty-five years. Isabella was only a few years younger.
When we contemplate her youth, her beauty, the long years of absence, without even a verbal
message passing between them, the deadly hostility of her father to the union, and the fact
that her hand had been repeatedly solicited by the most wealthy of the Spanish nobility, this
fidelity of Isabella to her youthful love is one of the most remarkable in the records of time.

    "During the long separation," says Mr. Wilmer, "of these
    exemplary lovers, many important changes had taken place.
    Time and sorrow had somewhat dimmed the lustre of Isabella's
    beauty. But she was still the fairest among ten thousand, and
    De Soto was too deeply enamored and too justly appreciative
    to value her the less, because the rose had partially faded
    from her cheek."

Immediately upon De Soto's return to Spain, as all obstacles to their union were removed, the
nuptial ceremony was performed. The voice of fame had already proclaimed De Soto as the real
conqueror of Peru. As such, he had not only enriched himself, but had also greatly enriched
the Spanish crown. All eyes were fixed upon him. It is said that at once he became the most
noted and most popular man in the kingdom. He and his bride were received at the Spanish court
with the most flattering marks of distinction. In his style of living he assumed almost regal
splendor. He had acquired his money very suddenly, and he lavished it with an unsparing hand.
A contemporary annalist writes:

    "He kept a steward, a gentleman usher, several pages, a
    gentleman of the horse, a chamberlain, a footman, and all
    other officers that the house of a nobleman requires."

One of the most splendid mansions in Seville he selected for his residence, and in less than
two years he found that one-half of his princely fortune had melted away. They were two years
of adulation, of self-indulgence, of mental intoxication. It was a delirious dream from which
he suddenly awoke. Reflection taught him that he must immediately curtail his expenses, and
very seriously, or engage in some new enterprise to replenish his wasting purse.

The region of North America called Florida, a territory of undefined and boundless extent,
was then attracting much attention as a fresh field for the acquisition of gold and glory.
Several expeditions had touched upon the unknown coast, but from various causes had proved
entire failures. Eight years before this De Narvaez had visited the country with three hundred
adventurers. He found the natives far more warlike than the Peruvians, and the country more
difficult of access. De Narvaez himself, and nearly all his band, fell before the fury of the
Floridians. Five only escaped. One of these, Cabaca de Vaca, a man of glowing imagination,
and who held the pen of a ready writer, wrote a Baron Munchausen account of the expedition.
He descanted upon the delicious clime, the luxuriant soil, the populous cities, the architectural
splendor of the edifices, and the inexhaustible mines of silver and of gold. There was no one
to call his account in question. His extravagant stories were generally believed.

De Soto, who was in the prime of his vigorous manhood, having as yet only attained his thirty-seventh
year, read this narrative and pondered these statements with enthusiasm. A couple of years
of inaction in his luxurious saloons had inspired him with new zeal for romantic adventure;
and to this there was added the powerful motive of the necessity of retrieving his fortunes.
He believed that gold could be gathered in Florida, even more abundantly than in Peru; that
by the aid of the crown a numerous colony might be established where, under genial skies, every
man could be put into possession of broad acres of the most luxuriant soil. And he felt fully
confident that his long experience on the isthmus and in Peru, qualified him in the highest
degree to be the leader of such an enterprise.

In these views he was sustained by the common sentiment of the whole community. De Soto applied
to the king of Spain, the Emperor Charles Fifth, for permission to organize an expedition,
at his own expense, for the conquest of Florida. He offered to the crown, as usual for its
share, one-fifth of the plunder.

Eagerly the Emperor, who was always in need of money, accepted the proposition, "asking no
questions, for conscience sake." The Emperor was very profuse in conferring honors and titles
upon his heroic subject. He appointed him governor of the island of Cuba, which he was to make
the base of his operations, investing him with almost dictatorial powers as both military and
civil governor. He also granted him a private estate in Florida, with the title of marquis,
in whatever part of the country he might choose. This magnificent estate was to consist of
a region, ninety miles long and forty-five miles wide.

As soon as it was known throughout Spain that De Soto was about to embark on such an enterprise,
volunteers began to flock to his standard. He would accept of none but the most vigorous young
men, whom he deemed capable of enduring the extremes of toil and hardship. In a few months
nine hundred and fifty men were assembled at San Lucar, eager to embark. Many of these were
sons of the wealthy nobles, who were thoroughly equipped in splendid style, with costly armor,
and accompanied by a train of servants.

Twenty-four ecclesiastics, of various grades, joined the expedition, whose arduous task it
was to convert the natives to that religion of the Spaniards which allowed them to rob their
houses and their temples, to maltreat their wives and daughters, to set fire to their villages,
to hunt them down with bloodhounds, and to trample them under the iron hoofs of their fiery steeds.

Never before had an expedition set out so abundantly supplied. Not only was every necessity
provided for, but luxury and even wasteful extravagance reigned through the armament. De Soto
himself was a man of magnificent tastes. Many who were with him in Peru, and had become there
enriched, had joined the enterprise. And the young nobles of Spain surrounded themselves with
the conveniences and splendor which large wealth could furnish.

The brilliant armament spread its sails to a favorable breeze at the port of San Lucar, on
the morning of the sixth of April, 1538. The squadron consisted of seven large ships, and three
smaller vessels. It must have been an imposing and busy scene in that little bay, upon which
the sun looked serenely down three hundred years ago. In addition to the Floridian fleet, there
was another squadron of twenty-six sail, at the same time weighing anchor, bound for Mexico.
Bugle peals resounded from ship and shore, while salvoes of artillery swept over the waves
and reverberated among the cliffs.

Isabella accompanied her husband, and quite an imposing train of attendants was attached to
the governor's family. The sail of a fortnight brought them to the Canary Islands. The Count
Gomera, a Spanish nobleman, was in command. No religious scruples lent their restraints to
his luxurious court. He had a very beautiful daughter, seventeen years of age, named Leonora.
The father loved her tenderly. He was perhaps anxious to shield her from the deleterious influences
with which she was surrounded. The high moral worth of Isabella impressed him; and arrangements
were made for Leonora to accompany Isabella to Cuba, as a companion, to be treated in all respects
as her own daughter.

On the twenty-fourth of April the fleet again set sail, and reached St. Jago de Cuba the latter
part of May. This city was then the capital of the island. It was situated on the southern
shore, at the head of a bay running inland about six miles. It was then quite populous, and
was opulent with the wealth of which previous Spanish adventurers had robbed the unhappy Cubans.
The whole city turned out with music, and banners and gorgeous processions, to give a suitable
reception to their new governor.

A grand tournament was held on the occasion. Among the cavaliers who were contending for the
prizes there was a young nobleman, Nuño de Tobar, who was De Soto's lieutenant-general. He
was one of the most accomplished of the Spanish grandees, and bore off many of the prizes.
The beauty of Leonora won his admiration. They were thrown much together, and he betrayed her.
At the confessional Leonora opened her heart to the priest. It is probable that he communicated
with the governor. De Soto's indignation was thoroughly roused. He summoned the culprit before
him. Tobar, deeming his offense a very trivial one, without hesitation acknowledged it, thinking,
perhaps, that he might receive some slight reprimand. He was not a little surprised when the
governor said in indignant tones:

"Leonora was placed under my care by her father. I pledged myself to protect her at the hazard
of my own life. To-morrow morning you must meet me in single combat, where you will have a
chance to protect the life you have justly forfeited."

There was no man probably, in the whole Spanish army, who could safely cross swords with De
Soto in mortal strife. Tobar was appalled. He well knew that in such a rencontre death was
his inevitable doom. Overwhelmed with confusion, he said:

"I have not committed a capital crime. If I had, I should not expect your Excellency to be
my executioner. It is impossible for me to contend with you in single combat. By accepting
your challenge, I doom myself to certain destruction."

De Soto replied: "Your crime is not a trivial one. You cannot evade the consequences by refusing
to meet them. To say nothing of the wrong you have done this unhappy girl, your treachery to
me deserves the punishment of a traitor. You may choose whether you will die like a soldier,
sword in hand, or like a criminal, under the axe of the executioner."

Tobar withdrew. He hastened to the room of the confessor. With him he called upon Leonora,
and, taking a few witnesses, repaired to the church, where the marriage ceremony was immediately
performed. Within an hour he returned to the governor and informed him that he had made all
the reparation in his power. De Soto, his brow still clouded with severe displeasure, replied:

"You have saved your life, but you can never regain my confidence. You are no longer my lieutenant.
That office can be held only by one whose honor is unsullied."

De Soto remained about three months in Cuba, making a tour of the island, establishing his
government, purchasing horses, and making other preparations for the expedition to Florida.
While thus engaged, he sent a vessel, with a picked crew, to coast along the shores of the
land he was about to invade, in search of a commodious harbor, where his troops might disembark.
After many perilous adventures, the vessel returned with a satisfactory report.

The fleet, and all the armament it was to bear, were rendezvoused at Havana, on the northern
coast of Cuba, where a fair wind in a few hours would convey them to the shores of Florida.
On the twelfth of May, some authorities say the eighteenth, of the year 1539, the expedition
set sail upon one of the most disastrous adventures in which heroic men ever engaged. Terrible
as were the woes they inflicted upon the natives, no less dreadful were the calamities which
they drew down upon themselves.

Isabella had been anxious to accompany her husband to Florida. But he, aware of the hardships
and perils to which they would be exposed, would not give his consent. She consequently remained
at Cuba, entrusted with the regency of the island. She never saw her husband again. Poor Isabella!
In sadness she had waited fifteen years for her nuptials. Two short years had glided away like
a dream in the night. And then, after three years of intense anxiety, during which she heard
almost nothing of her husband, the tidings reached her of his death. It was a fatal blow to
her faithful and loving heart. World-weary and sorrow-crushed, she soon followed him to the
spirit-land. Such is life; not as God has appointed it, but as sin has made it.

The expedition consisted of eight large ships, a caraval, and two brigantines. They were freighted
with everything which could be deemed needful to conquer the country, and then to colonize
it. The force embarked, in addition to the sailors who worked the ships, consisted of a thousand
thoroughly armed men, and three hundred and fifty horses. Contrary winds gave them a slow passage
across the gulf. On the twenty-fifth of May they entered the harbor of which they were in search.
It was on the western coast of the magnificent peninsula. De Soto then gave it the name of
Espiritu Santo. It is now however known as Tampa Bay.

As they entered the harbor beacon fires were seen blazing along the eminences, indicating that
the natives had taken the alarm, and were preparing for resistance. Several days were employed
in cautious sounding of the harbor and searching for a suitable landing-place, as it seemed
probable that opposition was to be encountered. On the last day of May, a detachment of three
hundred soldiers landed on the beach and took possession of the land in the name of Charles
the Fifth. The serene day was succeeded by a balmy night. Not an Indian was to be seen; and
the bloom, luxuriance and fruitage of the tropics, spread enchantingly around them.

The hours of the night passed away undisturbed. But just before dawn a terrific war-whoop resounded
through the forest, as from a thousand throats, and a band of Indian warriors came rushing
down, hurling upon the invaders a shower of arrows and javelins. The attack was so sudden and
impetuous that the Spaniards were thrown into a panic. They rushed for their boats, and with
loudest bugle peals, called for aid from their companions in the ships. The summons met with
a prompt response. Boats were immediately lowered, and a large party of steel-clad men and
horses were sent to their aid.

When Nuño Tobar was degraded, and dismissed from his office as lieutenant-general, a rich,
hair-brained Spanish nobleman, by the name of Vasco Porcallo, took his place. He was a gay
cavalier, brave even to recklessness, of shallow intellect, but a man who had seen much hard
service in the battlefields of those days. He was very rich, residing at Trinidad in Cuba.
He joined the enterprise for the conquest of Florida, influenced by an instinctive love of
adventure, and by the desire to kidnap Indians to work as slaves on his plantations. The valiant
Porcallo headed the party sent to the rescue of those on shore.

In such an adventure he was entirely in his element. Immediately upon landing he put spurs
to his horse and, accompanied by only seven dragoons, with his sabre flashing in the air, plunged
into the very thickest of the Indians. Soon they were put to flight. An Indian arrow, however,
pierced his saddle and its housings, and reached the vitals of his horse. The noble steed dropped
dead beneath him. Porcallo was quite proud of his achievement, and boasted not a little that
his arm had put the infidels, as he called the Indians, to flight, and that his horse was the
first to fall in the encounter.

During the day all the troops were disembarked and encamped upon the shore. It was reported
that there was quite a populous Indian town at the distance of about six miles from the place
of landing. While the ammunition and commissary stores were being brought on shore, the little
army marched for this village. It was the residence of the chief of the powerful tribe who
occupied that region. His name was Ucita, and from him the village received the same appellation.

The Spaniards met with no opposition on their march. But when they reached the village they
found it entirely deserted. It was quite a large town, the houses being built substantially
of timber, thatched with palm leaves. Many of these edifices were large and commodious, containing
several rooms. Their articles of household furniture were convenient, and some of them quite
elegant. The dresses, especially those of the females, were artistic and often highly ornamental.
Very beautiful shawls and mantillas were manufactured by them. Their finest fabrics were woven
by the hand from the fibrous bark of the mulberry-tree and hemp, which grew wild and in abundance.
The natives had acquired the art of rich coloring, and the garments thus manufactured by them
were often really beautiful. The walls of the houses of the wealthier citizens were hung with
tapestry of very softly tanned and richly prepared buckskin; and carpets of the same material
were spread upon the floors.

The Floridians were not acquainted with iron, that most indispensable article with nations
of high enlightenment. But they had succeeded in imparting a temper to copper, so as to give
many of their tools quite a keen edge. Though the inhabitants of Florida had not attained that
degree of civilization which had been reached by the Peruvians, it will be seen that they were
immeasurably in advance of the savages in the northern portion of the continent, and that their
homes far surpassed those of the peasantry of Ireland, and were more tasteful and commodious
than the log huts which European emigrants erect as their first home in the wilderness of the
West. They cultivated the ground mainly for their subsistence, though hunting and fishing were
resorted to, then as now, for recreation as well as for food.

De Soto took possession of the deserted village, and occupied the houses of the inhabitants
as barracks for his soldiers. A few straggling Indians were taken captive. From them he learned
that he was doomed to suffer for the infamous conduct of the Spanish adventurer, Narvaez, who
had preceded him in a visit to this region. This vile man had been guilty of the most inhuman
atrocities. He had caused the mother of the chief Ucita to be torn to pieces by bloodhounds,
and in a transport of passion had awfully mutilated Ucita himself, by cutting off his nose.
Consequently, the chief and all his people were exasperated to the highest degree. The injuries
they had received were such as could never be forgiven or forgotten.

De Soto was very anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the Indians. Whatever may have
been his faults, his whole career thus far had shown him to be by nature a kind-hearted and
upright man, hating oppression and loving justice. The faults of his character rather belonged
to the age in which he lived, than to the individual man. No military leader has ever yet been
able to restrain the passions of his soldiers. Wherever an army moves, there will always be,
to a greater or less degree, plunder and violence. De Soto earnestly endeavored to introduce
strict discipline among his troops. He forbade the slightest act of injustice or disrespect
towards the Indians. Whenever a captive was taken, he treated him as a father would treat a
child, and returned him to his home laden with presents. He availed himself of every opportunity
to send friendly messages to Ucita. But the mutilated chief was in no mood to be placated.
His only reply to these kind words was,

"I want none of the speeches or promises of the Spaniards. Bring me their heads and I will
receive them joyfully."

The energies of De Soto inspired his whole camp. The provisions and munitions of war were promptly
landed and conveyed to Ucita. The place was strongly fortified, and a hardy veteran, named
Pedro Calderon, was placed in command of the garrison entrusted with its defence. All the large
ships were sent back to Cuba, probably to obtain fresh supplies of military stores; some say
that it was to teach the army that, there being no possibility of escape, it now must depend
upon its own valor for existence.

De Soto was very unwilling to set out for a march into the interior for discovery and in search
of gold, while leaving so powerful a tribe as that over which Ucita reigned, in hostility behind
him. He therefore sent repeated messages to Ucita expressing his utter detestation of the conduct
of Narvaez; his desire to do everything in his power to repair the wrong which had been inflicted
upon him, and his earnest wish to establish friendly relations with the deeply-injured chief.

These reiterated friendly advances, ever accompanied by correspondent action, at length in
some slight degree mitigated the deadly rancor of Ucita, so that instead of returning a message
of defiance and hate, he sent back the truly noble response:

"The memory of my injuries prevents me from returning a kind reply to your messages, and your
courtesy is such that it will not allow me to return a harsh answer."

The man who, under these circumstances, could frame such a reply, must have been one of nature's
noblemen. De Soto could appreciate the grandeur of such a spirit. While these scenes were transpiring,
a man was brought into the camp, in Indian costume, who announced himself as a Spaniard by
the name of Juan Ortiz. He had been one of the adventurers under Narvaez. In the extermination
of that infamous band he had been taken captive and bound to the stake, to be consumed. He
was then but eighteen years of age, tall and very handsome. As the tongues of torturing flame
began to eat into his quivering flesh, cries of agony were extorted from him.

He was in the hands of a powerful chief, whose daughter is represented as a very beautiful
princess, by the name of Uleleh. She was about sixteen years of age, and could not endure the
scene. She threw her arms around her father's neck, and with tears of anguish pleaded that
his life might be saved. He was rescued; and though for a time he suffered extreme cruelty,
he eventually became adopted, as it were, into the tribe, and for ten years had resided among
the Indians, sometimes regarded as a captive, upon whom heavy burdens could be imposed, and
again treated with great kindness. Juan Ortiz being thus familiar with the habits of the natives
and their language, became an invaluable acquisition to the adventurers.

De Soto inquired very earnestly of him respecting the country and the prospect of finding any
region abounding with silver and gold. Ortiz had but little information to give, save that,
at the distance of about a hundred miles from where they then were, there was a great chief
named Uribaracaxi, to whom all the adjacent chiefs were tributary. His realms were represented
as far more extensive, populous, and rich than those of the surrounding chieftains. De Soto
dispatched a band of sixty horsemen and sixty foot soldiers with presents and messages of friendship
to Uribaracaxi. The object of the expedition was to explore the country and to make inquiries
respecting gold.

A weary march of about forty miles brought the party to the village of Mucozo, where Ortiz
had resided for some years. The chief of this tribe, whose name was also Mucozo, was brother-in-law
to Uribaracaxi. Mucozo received the Spaniards with great hospitality, and learning that they
were on a friendly visit to Uribaracaxi, furnished them with a guide. Four days were occupied
in a tedious march through a country where pathless morasses continually embarrassed their
progress.

This expedition was under the command of Balthazar de Gallegos. He reached his point of destination
in safety. But the chief, deeming it not prudent to trust himself in the hands of the Spaniards,
whose renown for fiendish deeds had filled the land, had retired from his capital, and nearly
all the inhabitants had fled with him. He left for his uninvited guests no message either of
welcome or defiance. Gallegos found all his attempts to open any communications with him unavailing.
There was no plunder in the city worth seizing, and De Soto's commands to the expedition were
very strict, to treat the Indians with the utmost kindness and humanity.

Gallegos made earnest inquiries of the Indians whom he met, as to the provinces where gold
and silver could be found. They told him that there was a country many leagues west of them,
of marvellous luxuriance and beauty, where gold was found in such abundance that the warriors
had massive shields and helmets made of that precious metal. The more shrewd of the Spaniards
placed very little reliance upon this testimony. They thought they saw evidence that the Indians
were ready to fabricate any story by which they could rid themselves of their visitors.

Soon after the departure of Gallegos, De Soto received the intelligence that the chief Ucita
had taken refuge in a forest, surrounded with swamps, not far from the Spanish camp. The vainglorious
Porcallo was exceedingly indignant that the Indian chief should presume to hold himself aloof
from all friendly advances. He entreated De Soto to grant him the privilege of capturing the
fugitive. De Soto complied with his request. The impetuous old man, fond of parade, and lavish
of his wealth, selected a band of horsemen and footmen, all of whom were gorgeously apparelled
for the occasion. He, himself, was mounted on a magnificent steed and cased in glittering armor.

It seems that the noble Ucita kept himself well informed of every movement of the invaders.
With a spirit of magnanimity which would have done honor to the best Christian in the Spanish
ranks, he sent a courier to meet Porcallo, and to say to him,

"You will only expose yourself to infinite peril from the rivers, morasses, and forests through
which you will have to pass in your attempt to reach my retreat. My position is so secure that
all your attempts to take me will result only in your own loss. I do not send you this message
from any fears on my own account, but because your leader, De Soto, has manifested so much
forbearance in not injuring my territory or my subjects."

It is really refreshing to find here and there, among all these demoniac deeds of demoniac
men, some remaining traces of that nobility of character which man had before the fall, when
created in God's image he was but little lower than the angels. Man, as we see him developed
in history, is indeed a ruin, but the ruin of a once noble fabric. When we think of what man
might be, in all generous affections, and then think of what man is, it is enough to cause
one to weep tears of blood.

Porcallo could not appreciate the magnanimity of Ucita. He regarded the message as one of the
stratagems of war, dictated either by fear or cowardice. He therefore ordered the trumpets
to sound the advance, his only fear being, that the chief might escape. Porcallo, a Quixotic
knight, had no element of timidity in his character. He led his troops. He never said "Go,"
but "Follow." Pressing rapidly forward, the little band soon arrived upon the border of a vast
and dismal morass, utterly pathless, stretching out many leagues in extent.

The hot-headed cavalier, thinking that the swamp might be waded, put spurs to his horse and
dashed forward. He had advanced but a few rods when the horse, struggling knee-deep through
the mire, stumbled and fell. One of the legs of the rider was so caught beneath the animal
as to pin him inextricably in the morass, covering him with water and with mud. The weight
of his armor sank him deeper in the mire, and in the desperate struggles of the steed for extrication,
he was in great danger of being suffocated. None could come to his aid without danger of being
swallowed up in the bog.

The unfeeling and brutal soldiers stood upon the borders of the morass with shouts of merriment,
as they witnessed the sudden discomfiture of their leader; a discomfiture the more ludicrous,
in contrast with his gorgeous attire, and his invariably proud and lofty bearing. At length
Porcallo extricated himself, and, drenched with water, and covered with mud, led his equally
bemired steed to the land. He was humiliated and enraged. The derision of the soldiers stung
him to the quick. He had embarked in the expedition to gain glory and slaves. He had encountered
disgrace; and the prospect of kidnapping the natives, under such a leader as De Soto had proved
himself to be, was very small.

It is probable that before this disaster he had seriously contemplated abandoning the expedition
and returning to his princely mansion in Trinidad. Ordering his men to face about, he sullenly
and silently returned to the Spanish camp. Throwing up his commission with disgust, he embarked
for Cuba, and we hear of him no more.

    "His train of servants," writes Mr. Theodore Irving,
    "Spanish, Indian and negro, were embarked with all speed. But
    when the gallant old cavalier came to take leave of his young
    companions in arms, and the soldiers he had lately aspired to
    lead so vain-gloriously, his magnificent spirit broke forth.
    He made gifts to the right and left, dividing among the
    officers and knights all the arms, accoutrements, horses and
    camp equipage, with which he had come so lavishly and so
    ostentatiously provided, and gave, for the use of the army,
    all the ample store of provisions and munitions brought for
    the use of himself and his retinue. This done, he bade
    farewell to campaigning and set sail for Cuba, much to the
    regret of the army, who lamented that so gallant a spirit
    should have burned out so soon."[B]

[Footnote B: Conquest of Florida, by Theodore Irving, p. 81.]

Indeed, it is stated in what is called "The Portuguese Narrative" of these events, that Porcallo
and De Soto had already quarrelled so decisively that they were no longer on speaking terms.
Porcallo, thoroughly destitute of moral principle, was a slave hunter; a character whom De
Soto thoroughly despised, and whose operations he would not on any account allow to be carried
on in his army. Porcallo therefore found no difficulty in obtaining permission to retire from
the service. Probably both the governor and his lieutenant were equally happy to be rid of
each other.

The day after the departure of Porcallo, a courier from Captain Gallegos, accompanied by a
small guard, came to the Spanish camp at Ucita. He informed De Soto that there was an ample
supply of provisions at Uribaracaxi to sustain the army for several days; and that he had received
information that at not a great distance from that place large quantities of gold could be
obtained. De Soto and his companions were greatly elated by these tidings, trusting that they
were about to enter upon another Peru. A garrison of forty horsemen and eighty foot soldiers,
was left at Ucita, to protect the military and commissariat stores collected there, and to
guard the three vessels still remaining in the bay. Captain Calderon, who was left in command,
was strictly enjoined to treat the Indians with the utmost kindness, and not to make war upon
them, even if provoked by taunts and insults.

De Soto, then, with the main body of his army, set out on the march for Uribaracaxi. It was
soon very evident to him that he was not in Peru. There was no smoothly-paved highway for his
soldiers to traverse. The country was pathless, rough, apparently uninhabited, encumbered with
tangled forests, and vast dismal swamps. It was a very arduous enterprise for soldiers burdened
with heavy armor to force their way through such a wilderness, with the baggage essential to
such a body of men.

One of the great objects of the governor, and a humane one, was to establish a colony in Florida.
A herd of three hundred swine was kept in the line of march, as these animals were deemed the
most advantageous stock for new settlers. After a toilsome march of two days they reached the
native village of Mucozo, where the friendly chief of the same name resided. It is said that
this place is now called Hichipuchsassa. The chief received them with great hospitality.

Pressing on without delay, they soon reached Uribaracaxi, which town it is supposed was situated
near the head of the Hillsborough river, which stream empties into Tampa Bay. The chief was
still absent, in his place of refuge, amidst the fastnesses of the forest. All of De Soto's
friendly endeavors to draw him from his retreat proved unavailing. The Spaniards were yet to
traverse many leagues of this unknown country before they could enter the region where it was
supposed the gold could be found.

Florida is emphatically a region of swamps. There is probably no section of our country which,
in a state of nature, would be more difficult for the passage of an army. About nine miles
from the village, directly on their line of march, extending far away to the east and the west,
there was a vast bog three miles wide. It was a chaotic region of mud and water, with gigantic
trees and entangling roots. After long search a passage was found through which, by the toilsome
efforts of a whole day, the army forced its way. Beyond the swamp there opened before them
a smooth, luxuriant flower-enamelled prairie. Rejoicingly the army pressed forward over this
beautiful expanse, when suddenly they found their steps again arrested by a series of sluggish
streams, stagnant bayous, and impenetrable bogs.

De Soto now took a hundred horse and a hundred foot soldiers, and leaving the remainder of
the army safely encamped, set out to explore the country in search of a practicable route of
travel. For three days he skirted the region of bogs, lakes and thickets, sending out his runners
in different directions to find some outlet. But there was no outlet for the journeyings of
civilized men. They captured some Indians, who offered to guide them, but who treacherously
led them to more difficult passes and into ambushes where many of their horses were slain.
The dreadful punishment of these false guides was to be torn to pieces by bloodhounds. They
bore their sufferings with amazing fortitude.

At length they found a very rude, difficult and dangerous path by which the Indians crossed
these swamps. At one point, where the water could not be forded for a distance of nearly three
hundred feet, the Indians had constructed a bridge by cutting down two large trees and uniting
the space that still remained between them in this Stygian lake, by tying logs together, with
cross-poles for flooring. To add to the embarrassments of the Spaniards, apparently innumerable
small bands of Indians were hovering on their track, assailing them with their sharp-pointed
arrows, wherever they could get a shot, and then escaping into the impenetrable region around.
They were very careful never to come to an open conflict. Canoes, propelled by the paddle,
would often dart out from the thickets, a shower of arrows be discharged, and the canoes disappear
where no foot could follow them.

A very bold courier, on one of the fleetest horses, was sent back to summon the main body of
the army to march, under the command of Moscoso, and join the party of explorers which De Soto
had led. This young man, by the name of Sylvestre, accomplished his feat through a thousand
perils and hair-breadth escapes.

Three days De Soto's band had passed struggling through bog and brake, bramble and forest.
Sylvestre was to find his path back travelling with all possible speed by night as well as
by day. One attendant only was with him, Juan Lopez. They never could have found their path
but through the sagacity of their horses. These noble animals seemed to be endowed for the
time with the instinct of setter dogs. For in the darkness of the night they would puff and
snort, with their noses close to the ground, ever, under the most difficult circumstances,
finding the track. The distance over which they urged their horses exceeded thirty miles. For
three days the poor creatures had not been unsaddled, and the bits had but occasionally been
removed from their mouths that they might enjoy the brief refreshment of grazing.

    "At times," writes Mr. Irving, "they passed within sight of
    huge fires, around which the savages were stretched in wild
    fantastic groups, or capering and singing, and making the
    forests ring with yells and howlings. These were probably
    celebrating their feasts with war-dances. The deafening din
    they raised was the safeguard of the two Spaniards, as it
    prevented the savages noticing the clamorous barking of their
    dogs, and hearing the tramping of the horses as they
    passed."[C]

[Footnote C: Conquest of Florida, p. 89.]

Immediately on the arrival of these two bold troopers, Moscoso dispatched supplies for the
governor with an escort of thirty horsemen. In the mean time the troops under De Soto were
nearly perishing with hunger. They were compelled to leave their encampment in search of food.
Fortunately, at no great distance, they found a beautiful valley, waving luxuriantly with fields
of corn or maize. Here they encamped and here were soon joined by the escort and their welcome
supplies. In a few days Moscoso came also with the residue of the army. They were about sixty
miles north of Uribaracaxi. It is supposed the place is now known by the old Indian name of
Palaklikaha.

The chief, whose name was Acuera, and all his people had fled to the woods. De Soto sent Indian
interpreters to him with friendly messages and the declaration that the Spaniards had no desire
to do him any injury; but that it was their power, if the Indians resisted, to punish them
with great severity. He also commissioned them to make the declaration, which to him undoubtedly
seemed perfectly just and reasonable, but which, to our more enlightened minds, seems atrocious
in the extreme, that it was their only object to bring him and his people into obedience to
their lawful sovereign, the king of Spain. With this end in view, he invited the chief to a
friendly interview. It can hardly be doubted that in that benighted age De Soto felt that he
was acting the part of a just and humane man, and of a Christian, in extending the Christian
reign of Spain over the heathen realms of Florida. Acuera returned the heroic reply:

"Others of your accursed race have, in years past, poisoned our peaceful shores. They have
taught me what you are. What is your employment? To wander about like vagabonds from land to
land; to rob the poor; to betray the confiding; to murder in cold blood the defenceless. With
such a people I want no peace--no friendship. War, never-ending, exterminating war, is all
the boon I ask. You boast yourself valiant; and so you may be, but my faithful warriors are
not less brave; and this, too, you shall one day prove, for I have sworn to maintain an unsparing
conflict while one white man remains in my borders; not openly, in battle, though even thus
we fear not to meet you, but by stratagem, and ambush, and midnight surprisals. I am king in
my own land, and will never become the vassal of a mortal like myself. As for me and my people,
we choose death, yes a hundred deaths, before the loss of our liberty and the subjugation of
our country."

This answer certainly indicates a degree of intelligence and mental culture far above what
we should expect to find in the chief of a tribe of Florida Indians. The chivalric spirit of
De Soto compelled him to admire the heroism it displayed. He consequently redoubled his efforts
to gain the friendship of the chief, but all in vain. For twenty days De Soto remained in this
encampment, recruiting his troops and making arrangements for a farther advance. The Indians
made constant warfare upon him, lurking in the thickets which densely surrounded his camp.
No Spaniard could wander one hundred steps without danger of being shot down by an invisible
foe, whose deadly arrow was more noiseless in its flight than the sighing of the breeze through
the tree tops. In this way, during these twenty days, fourteen Spaniards were killed and many
more wounded. Fifty Indians also fell struck by the bullets of the invaders. De Soto allowed
himself only in a war of self-defence. He strictly prohibited his followers from doing any
injury to the villages or the property of the natives, or of engaging in the slightest act
of violence towards any who were not in active hostility against them.

After twenty days of such repose as could be found in this war harassed camp, De Soto resumed
his march. He directed the steps of his army in a northeasterly direction towards a town called
Ocali, about sixty miles from their encampment. It seems that in most, if not all of this region,
the chief and his principal town bore the same name.

The path of the army led just over a dreary expanse of desert sands, about thirty miles broad.
There was no underbrush, and over the smooth surface both men and horses could travel with
the greatest ease. They then entered upon a beautiful region of fertility and luxuriance. Fields
of corn waved their graceful leaves and bannered heads in the breeze. Farm houses and pleasant
villages were scattered around, indicating that peace, with its nameless blessings, reigned
there. They reached the central town, Ocali, and found it to consist of six hundred substantially
built houses. This would give the place a population of probably not less than three thousand.

But the chief, Ocali, and his principal inhabitants, with their effects, had fled to the forests.
The Spanish army immediately took up its quarters in the dwellings of Ocali. They found here
an ample supply of provisions, which they seem without any questionings to have appropriated
to their own use. The clime was balmy, the region beautiful, the houses commodious, the food
abundant, and the few Indians who remained behind manifested no hostility. The common soldiers,
following the example of their leader, treated all with great kindness.

De Soto sent several Indian messengers daily to the retreat of the chief with proffers of peace
and friendship. Though Ocali rejected all these overtures, it seems that they must have made
an impression on the minds of some of his followers.

One day, four young Floridian warriors, gorgeously dressed and with nodding plumes, came to
the Spanish camp. De Soto received them with great cordiality and invited them to a handsome
collation with his principal officers. Mr. Irving, in his well authenticated narrative, gives
the following account of the scene which there ensued:

     "They sat down and appeared to be eating quietly, when
     perceiving the Spaniards to be off their guard, they rose
     suddenly and rushed full speed to the woods. It was in vain
     for the Spaniards to pursue them on foot, and there was no
     horse at hand. A hound of uncommon sagacity, however,
     hearing the cry of the Indians, and seeing them run, pursued
     them. Overtaking and passing by the first and second and
     third, he sprang upon the shoulders of the foremost and
     pulled him to the ground; as the next Indian passed on, the
     dog, leaving the one already down, sprang upon his successor
     and secured him in the same way. In like manner he served
     the third and fourth, and then kept running from one to the
     other, pulling them down as fast as they rose, and barking
     so furiously that the Indians were terrified and confounded
     and the Spaniards were enabled to overtake and capture them.
     They were taken back to the camp and examined separately.
     For as they were armed, the Spaniards apprehended some
     treachery; but it appeared that their sudden flight was only
     by way of exploit, to show their address and fleetness."[D]

[Footnote D: Irving's Conquest of Florida, p. 100.]

Ocali, after resisting for six days all friendly advances, was at length induced to visit the
Spanish camp. He was received by De Soto with the greatest kindness, and every effort was made
to win his confidence. There was a deep and wide river near the village which it was necessary
for the Spaniards to cross in their advance. De Soto, accompanied by Ocali and several of his
subjects, was walking on the banks of this stream to select a spot for crossing, by means of
a bridge or raft, when a large number of Indians sprang up from the bushes on the opposite
side, and assailing them with insulting and reproachful language, discharged a volley of arrows
upon them, by which one of the Spaniards was wounded.

Upon De Soto's demanding of the chief the meaning of this hostile movement, Ocali replied,
that they were a collection of his mutinous subjects, who had renounced their allegiance to
him, in consequence of his friendship for the Spaniards. The bloodhound, to which we have alluded,
that had so sagaciously captured the four Floridians, was in the company held in a leash by
one of the servants of the governor. The moment the ferocious animal heard the yells of the
Indians, and witnessed their hostile actions, by a desperate struggle he broke from his keeper
and plunged into the river. In vain the Spaniards endeavored to call him back. The Indians
eagerly watched his approach, and as he drew near they showered upon him such a volley of arrows,
that more than fifty pierced his head and shoulders. He barely reached the land, when he fell
dead. The army mourned the loss of the sagacious, fearless and merciless brute as if he had
been one of the most valiant of their warriors.

It soon became evident that Ocali had but slight influence over his tribe. De Soto, apprehensive
that it might be thought that he detained him against his will, advised him to return to his
people, assuring him that he would always be a welcome guest in the Spanish camp. He left,
and they saw him no more.

Crossing the river by a rude bridge constructed by the Spanish engineers, De Soto took the
lead with a hundred horse and a hundred foot. After a monotonous march of three days over a
flat country, they came to a very extensive province called Vitachuco, which was governed in
common by three brothers. The principal village, Ochile, was rather a fortress than a village,
consisting of fifty large buildings strongly constructed of timber. It was a frontier military
post; for it seems that this powerful tribe was continually embroiled in war with the adjacent
provinces. Mr. Williams, in his History of Florida, locates Ochile just south of what is called
the Allachua prairie.

There are two sources of information upon which we are dependent for most of the facts here
recorded. One is, the "History of Hernando De Soto," written by the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega.
He was the son of a Spanish nobleman and of a Peruvian lady of illustrious rank. His narrative
was written as related to him, by a friend who was one of the expedition. With some probable
exaggerations it is generally deemed authentic. Mr. Southey describes the work as one of the
most delightful in the Spanish language.

The other is what is called "The Portuguese Narrative." It is from the pen of an anonymous
writer, who declares himself to have been a Spanish cavalier, and that he describes the scenes
of which he was an eye-witness. Though these two accounts generally harmonize, there is at
times very considerable discrepancy between their statements. In the extraordinary events now
to be chronicled, the writer has generally endeavored to give the narrative, as has seemed
to him most probable, in comparing the two accounts, with the well-established character of
De Soto.

The advance guard of the Spanish army marched all night, and just before the dawn of the morning,
entered the silent streets of Ochile. Wishing to produce as deep an impression as possible
upon the minds of the Indians, their drums were beat, and their trumpets emitted their loudest
blasts, as one hundred horsemen with clattering hoofs, and one hundred footmen with resounding
arms, startled the citizens from their repose. To these simple natives, it must have been a
scene almost as astounding as if a legion of adventurers, from the star Sirius, were at midnight
to make their appearance in the streets of a European city.

The house of the chief was centrally situated. It was a large mansion, nearly three hundred
feet in length by one hundred and twenty in width. There were also connected with it quite
a number of outbuildings of very considerable dimensions.

As a matter of course, immediately the whole population was in the streets in a state of utter
amazement. It was the object of De Soto to appear in such strength, and to take such commanding
positions, as would prevent any assault on the part of the Indians, which would lead to bloodshed.
He was well informed of the warlike reputation of the chief who resided there; and knew that
in that fortress he was surrounded by a numerous band of warriors, ever armed and always ready
for battle. The region around was densely populated. Should the chief escape, determined upon
hostility, and rally his troops around him, it might lead to sanguinary scenes, greatly to
be deplored.

De Soto immediately held an interview with the chief; treated him with the utmost kindness
and assured him that he had no intention of inflicting any injury upon him or any of his subjects;
that he sought only for permission to pass peaceably and unmolested through his realms. The
soldiers were strictly enjoined to treat the natives in the most friendly manner, and not to
allow themselves, by any provocation whatever, to be drawn into a conflict.

The chief was very narrowly watched, that he might not escape. Still he was unconscious of
his captivity, for he was held by invisible chains.

During the following day the main body of the army entered Ochile with all the pomp which prancing
horses richly accoutred, gorgeous uniforms, bugle-blasts, waving banners, and glittering armor
could present. Ocile, its chief, and his warriors were at the mercy of the Spaniards. But they
had come not as conquerors, but as peaceful travellers, with smiles and presents, and kindly
words. Still the power of these uninvited guests was very manifest, and it was very evident
that any hostility on the part of the natives would bring down upon them swift destruction.

It so happened, that the youngest of the three brother chiefs resided at Ochile. At the suggestion
of De Soto, he sent couriers to his two brothers, informing them of the arrival of the Spaniards,
of their friendly disposition, and of their desire simply to pass through the country unmolested.
At the same time he stated, by request of De Soto, that the strength of the Spaniards was such
that they were abundantly able to defend themselves; and that should any attack be made upon
them, it would lead to results which all would have occasion to deplore.

The capital of the second brother was not far distant. In three days he came to Ochile, decorated
in gorgeous robes of state and accompanied by a retinue of his warriors, in their most showy
costume. It is recorded that he had the bearing of an accomplished gentleman, and seemed as
much at ease amidst the wondrous surroundings of the Spanish camp, as if he had been accustomed
to them all his days. He entered into the most friendly relations with De Soto and his distinguished
officers, and seemed very cordially to reciprocate all their courteous attentions.

Of the three brothers who reigned over this extended territory the elder bore the same name
with the province which he governed, which was Vitachuco. He was far the most powerful of the
three, in both the extent and populousness of his domain. His two brothers had united in sending
an embassy to him, earnestly enjoining the expediency of cultivating friendly relations with
the Spaniards. The following very extraordinary reply, which he returned, is given by Garcilaso
de la Vega. And though he says he quotes from memory, still he pledges his word of honor, that
it is a truthful record of the message Vitachuco sent back. We read it with wonder, as it indicates
a degree of mental enlightenment, which we had not supposed could have been found among those
semi-civilized people.

"It is evident," said the chief to his brothers, "that you are young and have neither judgment
nor experience, or you would never speak as you have done of these hated white men. You extol
them as virtuous men, who injure no one. You say that they are valiant; are children of the
Sun, and merit all our reverence and service. The vile chains which they have hung upon you,
and the mean and dastardly spirit which you have acquired during the short period you have
been their slaves, have caused you to speak like women, lauding what you should censure and abhor.

"You remember not that these strangers can be no better than those who formerly committed so
many cruelties in our country. Are they not of the same nation and subject to the same laws?
Do not their manner of life and actions prove them to be the children of the spirit of evil,
and not of the Sun and Moon--our Gods? Go they not from land to land plundering and destroying;
taking the wives and daughters of others instead of bringing their own with them; and like
mere vagabonds maintaining themselves by the laborious toil and sweating brow of others!

"Were they virtuous, as you represent, they never would have left their own country; since
there they might have practised their virtues; planting and cultivating the earth, maintaining
themselves, without prejudice to others or injury to themselves, instead of roving about the
world, committing robberies and murders, having neither the shame of men nor the fear of God
before them. Warn them not to enter into my dominions. Valiant as they may be, if they dare
to put foot upon my soil, they shall never go out of my land alive."

De Soto and his army remained eight days at Ochile. By unwearied kindness, he so won the confidence
of the two brother chiefs, that they went in person to Vitachuco to endeavor by their united
representations to win him to friendly relations with the Spaniards. Apparently they succeeded.
Vitachuco either became really convinced that he had misjudged the strangers, or feigned reconciliation.
He invited De Soto and his army to visit his territory, assigning to them an encampment in
a rich and blooming valley. On an appointed day the chief advanced to meet them, accompanied
by his two brothers and five hundred warriors, in the richest decorations and best armament
of military art as then understood by the Floridians.

De Soto and Vitachuco were about of the same age and alike magnificent specimens of physical
manhood. The meeting between them was as cordial as if they had always been friends. The Indian
warriors escorted their guests from their encampment to the capital. It consisted of two hundred
spacious edifices, strongly built of hewn timber. Several days were passed in feasting and
rejoicing, when Juan Ortiz informed the governor that some friendly Indians had revealed to
him that a plot had been formed, by Vitachuco, for the entire destruction of the Spanish army.

The chief was to assemble his warriors, to the number of about ten thousand, upon an extensive
plain, just outside the city, ostensibly to gratify De Soto with the splendors of a peaceable
parade. To disarm all suspicion, they were to appear without any weapons of war, which weapons
were however previously to be concealed in the long grass of the prairie. De Soto was to be
invited to walk out with the chief to witness the spectacle. Twelve very powerful Indians,
with concealed arms, were to accompany the chief or to be near at hand. It was supposed that
the pageant would call out nearly all the Spaniards, and that they would be carelessly sauntering
over the plain. At a given signal, the twelve Indians were to rush upon De Soto, and take him
captive if possible, or if it were inevitable, put him to death.

At the same moment the whole band of native warriors, grasping their arms, was to rush upon
the Spaniards in overpowering numbers of ten to one. In this way it was supposed that every
man could speedily be put to death or captured. Those who were taken prisoners were to be exposed
to the utmost ingenuity of Indian torture.

This seemed a very plausible story. De Soto, upon careful inquiry, became satisfied of its
truth. He consulted his captains, and decided to be so prepared for the emergence, that should
he be thus attacked, the Indian chief would fall into the trap which he had prepared for his
victims.

The designated day arrived. The sun rose in a cloudless sky and a gentle breeze swept the prairie.
Early in the morning, Vitachuco called upon De Soto, and very obsequiously solicited him to
confer upon him the honor of witnessing a grand muster of his subjects. He said they would
appear entirely unarmed, but he wished De Soto to witness their evolutions, that he might compare
them with the military drill of European armies. De Soto, assuming a very friendly and unsuspicious
air, assured the chief, that he should be very happy to witness the pageant. And to add to
its imposing display, and in his turn to do something to interest the natives, he said he would
call out his whole force of infantry and cavalry, and arrange them in full battle array on
the opposite side of the plain.

The chief was evidently much embarrassed by this proposition, but he did not venture to present
any obstacles. Knowing the valor and ferocity of his troops, he still thought that with De
Soto as his captive, he could crush the Spaniards by overwhelming numbers. Matters being thus
arranged, the whole Spanish army, in its most glittering array, defiled upon the plain. De
Soto was secretly well armed. Servants were ready with two of the finest horses to rush to
his aid. A body-guard of twelve of his most stalwart men loitered carelessly around him.

At nine o'clock in the morning, De Soto and Vitachuco walked out, side by side, accompanied
by their few attendants and ascended a slight eminence which commanded a view of the field.
Notwithstanding the careless air assumed by De Soto, he was watching every movement of Vitachuco
with intensest interest. The instant the Indian chief gave his signal, his attendants rushed
upon De Soto, and his ten thousand warriors grasped their arrows and javelins, and with the
hideous war-whoop rushed upon the Spaniards. But at the same instant a bugle blast, echoing
over the plain, put the whole Spanish army in motion in an impetuous charge. The two signals
for the deadly conflict seemed to be simultaneous. The body-guard of De Soto, with their far
superior weapons, not only repelled the Indian assailants, but seized and bound Vitachuco as
their captive. De Soto lost not a moment in mounting a horse, led to him by his servant. But
the noble animal fell dead beneath him, pierced by many arrows. Another steed was instantly
at his side, and De Soto was at the head of his cavalry, leading the charge. Never, perhaps,
before, did so terrible a storm burst thus suddenly from so serene a sky.

The natives fought with valor and ferocity which could not be surpassed even by the Spaniards.
All the day long the sanguinary battle raged, until terminated by the darkness of the night.
The field was bordered, on one side, by a dense forest, and on the other by a large body of
water, consisting of two lakes. Some of the natives escaped into the almost impenetrable forest.
Many were drowned. Several of the young men, but eighteen years of age, who were taken captive,--the
sons of chiefs,--developed a heroism of character which attracted the highest admiration of
De Soto. They fought to the last possible moment, and when finally captured, expressed great
regret that they had not been able to die for their country. They said to their conqueror,

"If you wish to add to your favors, take our lives. After surviving the defeat and capture
of our chieftain, we are not worthy to appear before him, or to live in the world."

It is said that De Soto was greatly moved with compassion in view of the calamity which had
befallen these noble young men. He embraced them with parental tenderness, and commended their
valor, which he regarded as proof of their noble blood.

    "For two days," writes Mr. Irving, "he detained them in the
    camp, feasting them at his table and treating them with every
    distinction; at the end of which time he dismissed them with
    presents of linen, cloths, silks, mirrors and other articles
    of Spanish manufacture. He also sent by them presents to
    their fathers and relations, with proffers of friendship."

De Soto had succeeded in capturing four of the most distinguished captains of Vitachuco. They
had been ostensibly the friends of the Spaniard, had ate at his table and had apparently reciprocated
all his kindly words and deeds. While thus deceiving him, they had coöperated with Vitachuco
for his destruction. De Soto summoned them with their chief before him.

    "He reproached them," says Mr. Irving "with the treacherous
    and murderous plot, devised against him and his soldiers, at
    a time when they were professing the kindest amity. Such
    treason, he observed, merited death; yet he wished to give
    the natives evidence of his clemency. He pardoned them,
    therefore, and restored them to his friendship; warning them,
    however, to beware how they again deceived him, or trespassed
    against the safety and welfare of the Spaniards, lest they
    should bring down upon themselves dire and terrible revenge."

Vitachuco was now a captive. Yet notwithstanding the conspiracy which had led to such deplorable
results, De Soto treated him with great kindness, giving him a seat at his own table, and endeavoring
in all ways to obliterate the remembrance of the conflict. De Soto was in search of gold. He
had heard of mountains of that precious metal far away in the interior. The natives had no
wealth which he desired to plunder. Their hostility he exceedingly deprecated, as it deprived
him of food, of comforts, and exposed his little band to the danger of being cut off and annihilated,
as were the troops of Narvaez, who had preceded him. The past career of De Soto proves, conclusively,
that he was by nature a humane man, loving what he conceived to be justice.

Under these circumstances, a wise policy demanded that he should do what he could to conciliate
the natives before he advanced in his adventurous journey, leaving them, if hostile, disposed
to cut off his return. It is said that nine hundred of the most distinguished warriors of Vitachuco
were virtually enslaved, one of whom was assigned to each of the Spaniards, to serve him in
the camp and at the table. Such at least is the story as it comes down to us. Vitachuco formed
the plan again to assail the Spaniards by a concerted action at the dinner-table. Every warrior
was to be ready to surprise and seize his master, and put him to death. There is much in this
narrative which seems improbable. We will, however, give it to our readers as recorded by Mr.
Irving in his very carefully written history of the Conquest of Florida. We know not how it
can be presented in a more impartial manner.

     "Scarcely had Vitachuco conceived this rash scheme than he
     hastened to put it into operation. He had four young Indians
     to attend him as pages. These he sent to the principal
     prisoners, revealing his plan, with orders that they should
     pass it secretly and adroitly from one to another, and hold
     themselves in readiness, at the appointed time, to carry it
     into effect. The dinner hour of the third day was the time
     fixed upon for striking the blow. Vitachuco would be dining
     with the governor, and the Indians in general attending upon
     their respective masters.

     "The cacique was to watch his opportunity, spring upon the
     governor and kill him, giving at the moment of assault a
     war-whoop which should resound throughout the village. The
     war-whoop was to be the signal for every Indian to grapple
     with his master or with any other Spaniard at hand and
     dispatch him on the spot.

     "On the day appointed Vitachuco dined as usual with the
     governor. When the repast was concluded, he sprang upon his
     feet, closed instantly with the governor, seized him with
     the left hand by the collar, and with the other fist dealt
     him such a blow in the face as to level him with the ground,
     the blood gushing out of eyes, nose and mouth. The cacique
     threw himself upon his victim to finish his work, giving at
     the same time his signal war-whoop.

     "All this was the work of an instant; and before the
     officers present had time to recover from their
     astonishment, the governor lay senseless beneath the tiger
     grasp of Vitachuco. One more blow from the savage would have
     been fatal; but before he could give it a dozen swords and
     lances were thrust through his body, and he fell dead.

     "The war-whoop had resounded through the village. Hearing
     the fatal signal, the Indians, attending upon their masters,
     assailed them with whatever missile they could command. Some
     seized upon pikes and swords; others snatched up the pots in
     which meal was stewing at the fire, and beating the
     Spaniards about the head, bruised and scalded them at the
     same time. Some caught up plates, pitchers, jars, and the
     pestles wherewith they pounded the maize. Others seized upon
     stools, benches and tables, striking with impotent fury,
     when their weapons had not the power to harm. Others
     snatched up burning fire-brands, and rushed like very
     devils into the affray. Many of the Spaniards were terribly
     burned, bruised and scalded. Some had their arms broken."

This terrible conflict was of short duration. Though the Spaniards were taken by surprise,
they were not unarmed. Their long keen sabres gave them a great advantage over their assailants.
Though several were slain, and many more severely wounded, the natives were soon overpowered.
The exasperated Spaniards were not disposed to show much mercy. In these two conflicts with
the Indians, Vitachuco fell, and thirteen hundred of his ablest warriors.

De Soto had received so terrific a blow, that for half an hour he remained insensible. The
gigantic fist of the savage had awfully bruised his face, knocking out several of his teeth.
It was four days before he recovered sufficient strength to continue his march and twenty days
elapsed before he could take any solid food. On the fifth day after this great disaster the
Spaniards resumed their journeyings in a northwest direction, in search of a province of which
they had heard favorable accounts, called Osachile. The first day they advanced but about twelve
miles, encamping upon the banks of a broad and deep river, which is supposed to have been the
Suwanee.

A band of Indians was upon the opposite side of the stream evidently in hostile array. The
Spaniards spent a day and a half in constructing rafts to float them across. They approached
the shore in such strength, that the Indians took to flight, without assailing them. Having
crossed the river they entered upon a prairie country of fertile soil, where the industrious
Indians had many fields well filled with corn, beans and pumpkins. But as they journeyed on,
the Indians, in small bands, assailed them at every point from which an unseen arrow or javelin
could be thrown. The Spaniards, on their march, kept in quite a compact body, numbering seven
or eight hundred men, several hundred of whom were mounted on horses gayly caparisoned, which
animals, be it remembered, the Indians had never before seen.

After proceeding about thirty miles through a pretty well cultivated country, with scattered
farm-houses, they came to quite an important Indian town called Osachile. It contained about
two hundred houses; but the terrified inhabitants had fled, taking with them their most valuable
effects, and utter solitude reigned in its streets.

The country was generally flat, though occasionally it assumed a little of the character of
what is called the rolling prairie. The Indian towns were always built upon some gentle swell
of land. Where this could not be found, they often constructed artificial mounds of earth,
sufficient in extent to contain from ten to twenty houses. Upon one of these the chief and
his immediate attendants would rear their dwellings, while the more humble abodes of the common
people, were clustered around. At Osachile De Soto found an ample supply of provisions, and
he remained there two days.

It is supposed that Osachile was at the point now called Old Town. Here De Soto was informed
by captive Indians that about thirty leagues to the west there was a very rich and populous
country called Appalachee. The natives were warlike in the highest degree, spreading the terror
of their name through all the region around. Gold was said to abound there. The country to
be passed through, before reaching that territory, was filled with gloomy swamps and impenetrable
thickets, where there was opportunity for ambuscades. De Soto was told that the Appalachians
would certainly destroy his whole army should he attempt to pass through those barriers and
enter their borders.

This peril was only an incentive to the adventurous spirit of the Spanish commander. To abandon
the enterprise and return without the gold, would be not only humiliating, but would be his
utter ruin. He had already expended in the undertaking all that he possessed. He had no scruples
of conscience to retard his march, however sanguinary the hostility of the natives might render
it. It was the doctrine of the so-called church at Rome, that Christians were entitled to the
possessions of the heathen; and though De Soto himself by no means professed to be actuated
by that motive, the principle unquestionably influenced nearly his whole army.

But he did assume that he was a peaceful traveller, desiring to cultivate only friendly relations
with the natives, and that he had a right to explore this wilderness of the new world in search
of those precious medals of which the natives knew not the value, but which were of so much
importance to the interest of all civilized nations.

For three days the Spaniards toiled painfully along over an arid, desert plain, beneath a burning
sun. Murphy, he shouted, "spoon away from water, and to hammer such as teaching." Drop at a time

"Keep after it was stopped there," said Pat and without hesitation,
his continued employment. Compelling some Indians to operate as guides, under penalty of being torn to pieces
by bloodhounds, De Soto commenced his march just after midnight. Two hundred picked men on
foot, but carefully encased in armor, led the advance in a long line two abreast. Every man
was furnished with his day's allowance of food in the form of roasted kernels of corn. They
pressed along through a path which they could not lose, and from which they could not wander,
till they reached the lake. Here the guides led them along by a narrow ford, up to their waists
in water, till they reached the bridge of logs. The advance-guard had just passed over this
bridge when the day dawned, and they were discovered by the Indians, who had not supposed they
would attempt to cross the morass by night.

The Appalachian warriors, with hideous yells and great bravery, rushed into the lake to meet
their foes. Here Spaniard and Floridian grappled in the death struggle up to their waists in
water. The steel-clad Spaniards, with their superior arms, prevailed, and the natives repulsed,
rushed into the narrow defile upon the other side of the lake. The main body of the army pressed
on, though continually and fiercely assailed by the arrows of the Indians. Arriving at a point
where there was an expanse of tolerably dry ground, De Soto sent into the forests around forty
skirmishers to keep off the Indians, while a hundred and fifty men were employed in felling
trees and burning brush, in preparation for an encampment for the night.

Exhausted by the toil of the march and of the battle; drenched with the waters of the lake;
many of them suffering from wounds, they threw themselves down upon the hot and smouldering
soil for sleep. But there was no repose for them that night. During all the hours of darkness,
the prowling natives kept up a continuous clamor, with ever recurring assaults. With the first
dawn of the morning the Spaniards resumed their march, anxious to get out of the defile and
into the open prairie beyond, where they could avail themselves of their horses, of which the
Indians stood in great dread. As they gradually emerged from the impenetrable thicket into
the more open forest, the army could be spread out more effectually, and the horsesmen could
be brought a little more into action. But here the valor of the natives did not forsake them.

    "As soon as the Spaniards," writes Mr. Irving, "entered this
    more open woodland, they were assailed by showers of arrows
    on every side. The Indians, scattered about among the
    thickets, sallied forth, plied their bows with intense
    rapidity, and plunged again into the forest. The horses were
    of no avail. The arquebusiers and archers seemed no longer a
    terror; for in the time a Spaniard could make one discharge,
    and reload his musket or place another bolt in his cross-bow,
    an Indian would launch six or seven arrows. Scarce had one
    arrow taken flight before another was in the bow. For two
    long leagues did the Spaniards toil and fight their way
    forward through this forest.

    "Irritated and mortified by these galling attacks and the
    impossibility of retaliating, at length they emerged into an
    open and level country. Here, overjoyed at being freed from
    this forest prison, they gave reins to their horses, and free
    vent to their smothered rage, and scoured the plain, lancing
    and cutting down every Indian they encountered. But few of
    the enemy were taken prisoners, many were put to the sword."

The Spaniards now entered upon a beautiful and highly cultivated region, waving with fields
of corn and adorned with many pleasant villages and scattered farm-houses. It seemed to be
the abode of peace, plenty and happiness. It certainly might have been such, but for the wickedness
of man. Wearied with their long march and almost incessant battle, the Spaniards encamped in
the open plain, where their horsemen would be able to beat off assaults.

But the night brought them no repose. It was necessary to keep a large force mounted and ready
for conflict. The natives, in large numbers, surrounded them, menacing an attack from every
quarter, repeatedly drawing near enough in the darkness to throw their arrows into the camp,
and keeping up an incessant and hideous howling. After a sleepless night, with the earliest
light of the morning they resumed their march along a very comfortable road, which led through
extensive fields of corn, beans, pumpkins and other vegetables. The prairie spread out before
them in its beautiful, level expanse, till lost in the distant horizon. All the day long their
march was harassed by bands of natives springing up from ambush in the dense corn-fields which
effectually concealed them from view. Many were the bloody conflicts in which the natives were
cut down mercilessly, and still their ferocity and boldness continued unabated.

After thus toiling on for six miles the Spaniards approached a deep stream, supposed to be
the river Uche. It was crossed by a narrow ford with deep water above and below. Here the natives
had constructed palisades, and interposed other obstacles, behind which, with their arrows
and javelins, they seemed prepared to make a desperate resistance. De Soto, after carefully
reconnoitering the position, selected a number of horsemen, who were most effectually protected
with their steel armor, and sent them forward, with shields on one arm, and with swords and
hatchets to hew away these obstructions, which were all composed of wood. Though several of
the Spaniards were slain and many wounded, they effected a passage, when the mounted horsemen
plunged through the opening, put the Indians to flight and cut them down with great slaughter.

Continuing their march, on the other side of the river, for a distance of about six miles through
the same fertile and well populated region, they were admonished by the approach of night,
again to seek an encampment. The night was dark and gloomy. All were deeply depressed in spirits.
An incessant battle seemed their destiny. The golden mountains of which they were in pursuit
were ever vanishing away. They were on the same path which had previously been traversed by
the cruel but energetic Narvaez, and where his whole company had been annihilated, leaving
but four or five to tell the tale of the awful tragedy.

Dreadful as were the woes which these adventurers had brought upon the Indians, still more
terrible were the calamities in which they had involved themselves. They were now three hundred
miles from Tampa Bay. Loud murmurs began to rise in the camp. Nearly all demanded to return.
But, for De Soto, the abandonment of the enterprise was disgrace, and apparently irretrievable
ruin. There was scarcely any condition of life more to be deplored than that of an impoverished
nobleman. De Soto was therefore urged onward by the energies of despair.

Again through all the hours of the night, they were exposed to an incessant assault from their
unwearied foes. From their captives they learned that they were but six miles from the village
of Anhayea, where their chief, Capafi, resided. This was the first instance in which they heard
of a chief who did not bear the same name as the town in which he dwelt. Early in the morning,
De Soto, with two hundred mounted cavaliers and one hundred footmen, led the advance, and soon
entered the village, which consisted of two hundred and fifty houses, well built and of large size.

At one end of the village stood the dwelling of the chief, which was quite imposing in extent,
though not in the grandeur of its architecture. The chief and all his men had fled, and the
Spaniards entered deserted streets. The army remained here for several days, finding abundance
of food. Still they were harassed, day and night, by the indomitable energy of the natives.
Two well armed expeditions were sent out to explore the country on the north and the west,
for a distance of forty or fifty miles, while a third was dispatched to the south in search
of the ocean.

Anhayea, where the main body of the army took up its quarters, is supposed to have been near
the present site of the city of Tallahassee. The two first expeditions sent out, returned,
one in eight and the other in nine days, bringing back no favorable report. The other, sent
in search of the ocean, was absent much longer, and De Soto became very apprehensive that it
had been destroyed by the natives.

Through many perilous and wild adventures, being often betrayed and led astray by their guides,
they reached, after a fortnight's travel, the head of the bay now called St. Mark's. Here they
found vestiges of the adventurers who had perished in the ill-fated Narvaez expedition. There
was a fine harbor to which reinforcements and fresh supplies of ammunition might be sent to
them by ships from Cuba, or from Tampa Bay. With these tidings they hurried back to Anhayea.

They had now reached the month of November, 1539. The winter in these regions, though short,
had often days of such excessive cold that men upon the open prairie, exposed to bleak winds
called northers, often perished from the severity of the weather. De Soto resolved to establish
himself in winter-quarters at Anhayea. With his suite he occupied the palace of the chief.
The other houses were appropriated to the soldiers for their barracks. He threw up strong fortifications
and sent out foraging parties into the region around, for a supply of provisions. As we have
no intimation that any payment was made, this was certainly robbery. Whatever may be said of
the necessities of his case, it was surely unjust to rob the Indians of their harvests. Still,
De Soto should not be condemned unheard; and while we have no evidence that he paid the natives
for the food he took from them, still we have no proof that he did not do so.

In accordance with his invariable custom, he made strenuous efforts to win the confidence of
the natives. Through captive Indians he sent valuable presents to the chief Capafi in his retreat,
and also assurances that he sought only friendly relations between them. The chief, however,
was in no mood to give any cordial response to these advances. He had taken refuge in a dense
forest, surrounded by dismal morasses, which could only be traversed by a narrow pass known
only to the Indians, where his warriors in ambush might easily arrest the march of the whole
army of Spaniards. The brutal soldiery of Narvaez had taught them to hate the Spaniards.

He kept up an incessant warfare, sending out from his retreat fierce bands to assail the invaders
by day and by night, never allowing them one moment of repose. Many of the Spaniards were slain.
But they always sold their lives very dearly, so that probably ten natives perished to one
of the Spaniards. There was nothing gained by this carnage. De Soto was anxious to arrest it.
Every consideration rendered it desirable for him to have the good will of the natives. Peace
and friendship would enable him to press forward with infinitely less difficulty in search
of his imaginary mountains of gold and silver, and would greatly facilitate his establishment
of a colony around the waters of some beautiful bay in the Gulf, whence he could ship his treasures
to Spain and receive supplies in return.

Finding it impossible to disarm the hostility of Capafi by any kindly messages or presents,
he resolved if possible to take him captive. In this way only could he arrest the cruel war.
The veneration of the Indians for their chief was such that, with Capafi in the hands of the
Spaniards as a hostage, they would cease their attacks out of regard to his safety.

It was some time before De Soto could get any clew to the retreat in which Capafi was concealed.
And he hardly knew how to account for the fact, that the sovereign of a nation of such redoubtable
ferocity, should never himself lead any of his military bands, in the fierce onsets which they
were incessantly making. At length De Soto learned that Capafi, though a man of great mental
energy, was incapacitated from taking the field by his enormous obesity. He was so fat that
he could scarcely walk, and was borne from place to place on a litter. He could give very energetic
commands, but the execution of them must be left to others. He also ascertained that this formidable
chief had taken up his almost unapproachable quarters about twenty-five miles from Anhayea;
and that in addition to the tangled thickets and treacherous morasses with which nature had
surrounded him, he had also fortified himself in the highest style of semi-barbarian art, and
had garrisoned his little fortress with a band of his most indomitable warriors.

Notwithstanding the difficulty of the enterprise, De Soto resolved to attempt to capture him.
This was too arduous a feat to be entrusted to the leadership of any one but himself. He took
a select body of horsemen and footmen, and after a very difficult journey of three days, came
to the borders of the citadel where the chief and his garrison were intrenched. Mr. Irving,
in his admirable history of the Conquest of Florida, gives the following interesting account
of the fortress, and of the battle in which it was captured:

    "In the heart of this close and impervious forest, a piece of
    ground was cleared and fortified for the residence of the
    Cacique and his warriors. The only entrance or outlet, was by
    a narrow path cut through the forest. At every hundred paces,
    this path was barricaded by palisades and trunks of trees,
    at each of which was posted a guard of the bravest warriors.
    Thus the fat Cacique was ensconced in the midst of the forest
    like a spider in the midst of his web, and his devoted
    subjects were ready to defend him to the last gasp.

    "When the Governor arrived at the entrance to the perilous
    defile, he found the enemy well prepared for its defence. The
    Spaniards pressed forward, but the path was so narrow that
    the two foremost only could engage in the combat. They gained
    the first and second palisades at the point of the sword.
    There it was necessary to cut the osiers and other bands,
    with which the Indians had fastened the beams. While thus
    occupied they were exposed to a galling fire and received
    many wounds. Notwithstanding all these obstacles, they gained
    one palisade after the other until, by hard fighting, they
    arrived at the place of refuge of the Cacique.

    "The conflict lasted a long time, with many feats of prowess
    on both sides. The Indians however, for want of defensive
    armor, fought on unequal terms, and were most of them cut
    down. The Cacique called out to the survivors to surrender.
    The latter, having done all that good soldiers could do, and
    seeing all their warlike efforts in vain, threw themselves on
    their knees before the Governor and offered up their own
    lives, but entreated him to spare the life of their Cacique.

    "De Soto was moved by their valor and their loyalty;
    receiving them with kindness, he assured them of his pardon
    for the past, and that henceforth he would consider them as
    friends. Capafi, not being able to walk, was borne in the
    arms of his attendants to kiss the hands of the Governor,
    who, well pleased to have him in his power, treated him with
    urbanity and kindness."

Severe as had been the conflict, De Soto returned to Anhayea with his captive, highly gratified
by the result of his enterprise. He had strictly enjoined it upon his troops not to be guilty
of any act of wanton violence. On the march he had very carefully refrained from any ravaging
of the country. He now hoped that, the chief being in his power and being treated with the
utmost kindness, all hostilities would cease. But, much to his disappointment, the warriors
of Capafi, released from the care of their chief, devoted themselves anew to the harassment
of the Spaniards in every possible way.

Capafi seemed much grieved by this their conduct, assuming to be entirely reconciled to his
conqueror. He informed De Soto that his prominent warriors, who directed the campaign, had
established their headquarters in a dense forest about thirty miles from Anhayea. He said that
it would be of no avail for him to send messengers to them, for they would believe that the
messages were only such as De Soto compelled their chief to utter. He however offered to go
himself to the camp of his warriors, accompanied by such a guard of Spanish troops as De Soto
might deem it best to send with him. He expressed the assurance, that he should be enabled
to induce his warriors to throw down their arms.

De Soto accepted the proposition. In the early morning a strong escort of infantry and cavalry
left the village to conduct the chief to the encampment of the natives. Skillful guides accompanied
them, so that they reached the vicinity of the encampment just as the sun was going down. The
chief sent forward scouts immediately, to inform his friends of his approach. The Spaniards,
weary of their long day's march, and convinced of the impossibility of the escape of the chief,
who could scarcely walk a step, were very remiss in watchfulness. Though they established sentinels
and a guard, in accordance with military usage, it would seem that they all alike fell asleep.
It is probable that the wily chief had sent confidential communications to his warriors through
his scouts.

The Spaniards were encamped in the glooms of the forest. At midnight, when darkness, silence
and solitude reigned, Capafi stealthily crept on his hands and knees, a few rods from his sleeping
guard, into the thicket, where a band of Indian runners met him with a litter and bore him
rapidly away beyond all chance of successful pursuit. The Spaniards never caught glimpse of
their lost captive again. When they awoke their chagrin and dread of punishment were extreme.
The sentinels, who had been appointed to watch the captive, solemnly averred, in excuse for
their neglect, that during the night demoniac spirits had appeared, and had borne away the
unwieldy chief through the air.

As all the band were implicated in the escape, all were alike ready to aver that, during the
night, they had witnessed very strange sights and heard very strange sounds. When they carried
back this report, the good-natured De Soto, convinced that fretting and fault-finding would
do no good, appeased their alarm by saying, with a peculiar smile:

"It is not strange. These Indian wizards perform feats far more difficult than conjuring away
a fat chief."

The winter passed slowly away. The natives were a very ferocious race; tall, strong, athletic,
and delighting in war. Every day and every hour brought alarm and battle. The Indians conducted
a harassing and destructive warfare. In small bands they roamed through the forest, cutting
off any who ventured to wander from the town. It required a large amount of food to supply
the wants of the army in Anhayea. Not a native carried any provisions to the town, and it was
necessary for De Soto to send out foraging expeditions, at whatever risk. The winter was cold.
Fires were needed for warmth and cooking. But the sound of an axe could not be heard in the
forest, without drawing upon the wood-cutters, a swarm of foes. De Soto found himself in what
is called a false position; so that he deemed it necessary to resort to cruel and apparently
unjustifiable expedients.

He took a large number of Indian captives. These he compelled to be his hewers of wood and
drawers of water. He would send a party of Spaniards into the forests for fuel. Each man led
an Indian as a servant to operate in the double capacity of a shield against the arrows of
the natives, and a slave to collect and bring back the burden. To prevent the escape of these
Indians, each one was led by a chain, fastened around his neck or waist. Sometimes these natives
would make the most desperate efforts to escape; by a sudden twitch upon the chain they would
endeavor to pull it from the hands of their guard, or to throw him down and, seizing any club
within their reach, would spring upon him with the ferocity of a tiger.

In various ways more than twenty Spaniards lost their lives, and many more were seriously wounded.
It was indeed a melancholy winter for the army of De Soto. Their supplies were so far expended
that it was needful for them to await the arrival of their vessels in the Bay of St. Marks.
It will also be remembered, that De Soto had sent back an expedition to cut its way for a distance
of three hundred miles through hostile nations to Ucita, and to summon the garrison there,
to set out on a march to join him at Anhayea. Five months were thus spent in weary waiting.

It is estimated that De Soto's force in Anhayea, including the captives who were servants or
slaves, amounted to about fifteen hundred persons. He had also over three hundred horses. The
fertility of the region was however such, with its extended fields of corn, beans, pumpkins
and other vegetables, that it was not necessary to send foraging parties to a distance of more
than four or five miles from the village. On the 29th of December, 1539, the two brigantines,
which had sailed from Tampa Bay, came into St. Marks, then called the Bay of Aute. For twelve
days before the arrival of the ships, De Soto had kept companies of horse and foot marching
and countermarching between Anhayea and the Bay, to keep the communication open. They also
placed banners on the highest trees, as signals to point out the place of anchorage.

Juan De Añasco, who had command of the vessels, left them well manned in the bay, and with
the remainder of the ship's company marched to Anhayea, under escort of the troops sent him
by De Soto.

Soon after this, Pedro Calderon arrived with his gallant little band of a hundred and twenty
men. By a series of the wildest adventures and most heroic achievements they had cut their
way through a wilderness thronging with foes, where an army of eight hundred men had with difficulty
effected a passage. Fighting every step of the way and bearing along with them their wounded,
their progress was necessarily slow. Several of their number were killed and many wounded.
Of the wounded, twelve died soon after they reached Anhayea.

Their arrival in the village was a cause of great gratification to all there. De Soto received
them as an affectionate father welcomes his son whom he had supposed to have been lost. The
rumor had reached the Governor that all had been slain on the road.

Captain Calderon brought a letter to De Soto, from his wife Isabella. We find the following
interesting extract from this letter in the life of De Soto by Mr. Lambert A. Wilmer. It seems
to bear internal evidence of authenticity, though we know not the source from which Mr. Wilmer
obtained it. The spirit of the letter is in entire accord with the noble character which Mr.
Washington Irving gives Isabella, in his life of Columbus and his companions. 

     The main points are of course
     (1) The present situation of the English language regarding
     with the homophones:
     (1) Consequently using poor English language  
(2) The truth that
we are unawaringly increasing them. 
(3) Thier uncomfotableness
Considering these things, the question must arise whether is it
not our duty to take steps to avert continous growth of this evil?
     The Bishop has proved to me that all who have taken part in
     the abuse of these harmless people, have been visited in
     this life with the manifest displeasure of heaven; and God
     grant that they may not be punished in the life to come
     according to the measure of their offense.

     "I hope, my dearest husband that no considerations of
     worldly advantage will make you neglectful of the precepts
     of humanity and of the duties of religion. Be persuaded to
     return to me at once; for you can gain nothing in Florida
     which can repay me for the sorrow and anxiety I feel in your
     absence. Nor for all the riches of the country would I have
     you commit one act the remembrance of which would be painful
     to you hereafter. If you have gained nothing I shall be
     better satisfied, because there may be the less cause for
     repentance. Whatever may have been your want of success or
     your losses, I implore you to come to me without delay; for
     any reverse of fortune is far better than the suspense and
     misery I now endure."

This letter must have caused De Soto great perplexity. But for reasons which we have above
given he could not make up his mind to abandon the enterprise, and return to Cuba an unsuccessful
and impoverished man.

De Soto now ordered the two vessels under Diego Maldonado to explore the coast to the westward,
carefully examining every river and bay. It would seem also probable that at the same time
he fitted out an expedition of fifty foot soldiers, to march along the coast on a tour of discovery.
Maldonado, after a sail of about two hundred miles, entered the beautiful bay of Pensacola,
then called Archusi. It was an admirable harbor, and with shores so steep and bold that ships
could ride in safety almost within cable length of the land. No Spaniards had previously visited
that region, consequently the natives were friendly. They came freely on board, bringing fruits
and vegetables, and inviting the strangers to the hospitality of their homes.

Maldonado was allowed without molestation to explore the bay in all directions, taking careful
soundings. The vessels returned to the bay of Aute, after an absence of but eight weeks. De
Soto was highly gratified with the results of the expedition. It seemed to him that the shores
of the bay of Pensacola presented just the position he desired for the location of his colony.
He had thus far failed, in his search for gold, but it seemed to him still possible that he
might lay the foundation of a populous and powerful empire.

It was now the latter part of February, and an almost vertical sun was throwing down its rays
upon them. Maldonado was dispatched with the brigantines to Havana, to return with a supply
of clothing, ammunition and such other freight as was needful for the army in its isolated
condition. He received orders to be back in the bay of Pensacola, by the first of October.
In the mean time De Soto with his army was to make a long circuit through the country, in search
of gold. De Soto had received information of a distant province called Cofachiqui, which was
governed by a queen, young and beautiful. It was said that this nation was quite supreme over
the adjacent provinces, from which it received tribute and feudal homage.

Two lads but sixteen years of age had come to Anhayea, from this province in company with some
Indian traders. So far as they could make themselves understood, though very unskilful interpreters,
they represented the country as abounding in silver, gold and precious stones. In pantomime
they described the process of mining and smelting the precious metals so accurately that experienced
miners were convinced that they must have witnessed those operations.

In the month of March, 1540, De Soto left his comfortable quarters, and commenced his march
for that province, in a northeasterly direction. Their path led first through an almost unpeopled
wilderness many leagues in extent. Each soldier bore his frugal supper or food upon his back.
It consisted mainly of roasted corn pounded or ground into meal.

An unobstructed but weary tramp of three days brought them through this desert region to a
very singular village, called Capachiqui. In the midst of a vast morass, there was an island
of elevated and dry ground. Here quite a populous village was erected, which commanded a wide
spread view of the flat surrounding region. The village could only be approached by several
causeways crossing the marsh, about three hundred feet in length. The country beyond was fertile
and sprinkled with small hamlets. Eight hundred armed warriors, on the open plain, presented
a force which the most valiant Indians would not venture to assail. The Spaniards entered the
village by these causeways unopposed, and found there a not inhospitable reception.

The day after their arrival, seven of De Soto's body-guard, thoughtless and rollicking young
men, set out, without authority from their superior officers, to seek amusement in the neighboring
hamlets. They had scarcely reached the main land, beyond the marsh, when the Indians, from
an ambush, rushed upon them, and after a very fierce struggle all but one were slain, and that
one, Aguilar, was mortally wounded. The soldiers in the village hastened to the relief of their
comrades, but they were too late. Aguilar, in a dying condition, was carried back to the encampment.
He had, however, sufficient strength left to make the following extraordinary statement:

"You must know that a band of more than fifty savages sprang out of the thickets to attack
us. The moment, however, they saw that we were but seven, and without our horses, seven warriors
stepped forth, and the rest retired to some distance. They began the attack, and as we had
neither arquebus nor cross-bow, we were entirely at their mercy. Being more agile, and fleet
of foot than our men, they leaped around us like so many devils, with horrid laughter, shooting
us down like wild beasts without our being able to close with them. My poor comrades fell one
after the other, and the savages seeing me alone, all seven rushed upon me, and with their
bows battered me as you have witnessed."

This singular event took place within the territory of Appalachee. It is said that the Spaniards
not unfrequently met with similar instances, in which the natives disdained to avail themselves
of superior numbers.

After a couple of days of rest and feasting, the Spanish army resumed its march. De Soto led
the advance with forty horsemen and seventy foot soldiers. Ere long they entered the province
of Attapaha, from which the river Attapaha probably takes its name. On the morning of the third
day they approached a village called Achise. The affrighted natives had fled. Two warriors
who had tarried behind, were captured as the dragoons came dashing into the streets. They were
led into the presence of De Soto. Without waiting to be addressed by him, they haughtily assailed
him with the question,

"What is it you seek in our land? Is it peace, or is it war?" De Soto replied, through his
interpreter,

"We seek not war with any one. We are in search of a distant province; and all that we ask
for is an unobstructed passage through your country, and food by the way."

The answer seemed to them perfectly satisfactory, and they at once entered apparently into
the most friendly relations. The captives were set at liberty and treated by the Spaniards,
in all respects, as friends. Promptly the two warriors sent a message to their chief, informing
him of the peaceful disposition of the Spaniards, and he accordingly issued orders to his people
not to molest them.

In this pleasant village, and surrounded by this friendly people, De Soto spent three days.
He then resumed his journey, in a northeasterly direction, along the banks of some unknown
river, fringed with mulberry trees, and winding through many luxuriant and beautiful valleys.
The natives were all friendly, and not the slightest collision occurred. For eleven days the
army continued its movements, encountering nothing worthy of note.

They then entered a province called Cofa. De Soto sent couriers in advance to the chief with
proffers of friendship. The chief, in return, sent a large number of Indians laden with food
for the strangers. With the provisions were sent rabbits, partridges, and a species of dog
whose flesh was held in high esteem. The Spaniards suffered for want of meat; for though game
in the forest was abundant, being constantly on the march, they had no time for hunting.

The chief of Cofa received the Spaniards in his metropolitan town with great hospitality. He
assigned his own mansion to De Soto, and provided comfortable quarters for all his troops.
The natives and the Spaniards mingled together without the slightest apparent antagonism. The
province of Cofa was of large extent, populous and fertile. Here the Spaniards remained five
days, entertained by the abounding hospitality of the chief.

De Soto had thus far brought with him a piece of ordnance, which had proved of very little
service. It was heavy and exceedingly difficult of transportation. He decided to leave it behind
him with this friendly people. To impress them, however, with an idea of its power as an engine
of destruction, he caused it to be loaded and aimed at a large oak tree just outside of the
village. Two shots laid the oak prostrate. The achievement filled both the chief and his people
with amazement and awe.

Again the army resumed its march towards the next province, which was called Cofaqui; whose
chief was brother of Cofa. The Spaniards were escorted by Cofa and a division of his army,
during one day's journey. The friendly chief then took an affectionate leave of De Soto, and
sent forward couriers to inform his brother of the approach of the Spaniards and to intercede
for his kindly offices in their behalf. It required a march of six days to reach the territory
of the new chieftain.

In response to Cofa's message, Cofaqui dispatched four of his subordinate chiefs, with a message
of welcome to the Spaniards. He sent out his runners to bring him speedy intelligence of their
approach. As soon as he received news that they were drawing near, he started himself, with
a retinue of warriors in their richest decorations, to welcome the strangers. The meeting,
on both sides, was equally cordial. Side by side, almost hand in hand, the Floridians and the
Spaniards entered the pleasant streets of Cofaqui. The chief led De Soto to his own mansion,
and left him in possession there while he retired to another dwelling.

The intercourse between these two illustrious men seemed to be as cordial as that between two
loving brothers. The Floridian chief, with great frankness, gave De Soto information respecting
the extent, population and resources of his domain. He informed him that the province of Cofachiqui,
of which he was in search, could only be reached by a journey of seven days, through a dreary
wilderness. But he offered, should De Soto decide to continue his journey, to send a strong
band of his army, to accompany him with ample supplies. De Soto afterwards ascertained that
there was some duplicity in this proposal; or rather, that the chief had a double object in
view. It appeared, that there had been long and hereditary antagonism between the province
of Cofaqui, and that of Cofachiqui; and the chief availed himself of that opportunity to invade
the territory of his rival.

Scouts were sent out in all directions to assemble the warriors, and De Soto was surprised
to find an army of four thousand soldiers, and as many burden-bearers, ready to accompany him. The
sadness of those times was not without relief, however. He was able, when Heloise's convent
at Argenteuil broke up, to have her placed in charge of a newly created religious house at
Parcelete - and as a spiritual director he could return to the place
that was dear to him.

Heloise was held in high esteem because of her intellect and charisma, and never mentioned the
tradegy that had befallen her in youth. Now, however, it became appropriate to communicate
her tormented emotions. Abelard had written "Historia Calamitalum" whilst apart, and this had
moved her to begin writing of her passions and her devotion, and
ultimately of her resignation to the role of a sister to a brother.

Soon after in 1136, Abelard was once again ecturing at Mount St. Genevieve, as related by John of Salisbury.
This did not last long, and did not repeat his early triumphs. He found himself in difficulty
one more time in the subsequent years. Back during his days at Parcelete, he had made an emeny
of Bernard of Clairvaux whose unquestioning faith conflicted with Abelard's spirit of rationality,
and now Bernard sought to destory this growing evil personally.

Initial talks between Abelard and Bernard drove the latter even harder.

When a council met at Sens (1141), Abelard was arraigned upon a number of heretical charges,
and was prepared to plead his cause. He appealed to Rome, but this availed him of no beneift, as
Bernard was able to not only get a condemnation from the council, but also one from Rome a year
later. Furthermore, on his way to make his plea in person, Abelard had collapsed at the Abbey
of Cluny, and lingered there a broken man, for a few months before his death on the 21st of April
1142. His remains were secretly carried off to Paraclete, and left in the loving care of Heloise
who later (1164) came to rest beside them.

The pair's bones were moved once again after they were buried, but after that were incredibly well
preserved even through the chaos of the French Revolution, and they are now located in the cemetary
of Pere-la-Chaise at Paris.
The first of Abelard's philosophical works, the ethical trestise, Scito te ipsum, was published
in 1721, but it was not till the 19th century, when Cousin in 1836
issued the collection entitled Ouvrages inedits d'Abelard, that his
philosophical performance could be judged at first hand.

This work also includes the commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry and Boothius,
Dialectica, extracts from the theological work Sic et Non (an compilation of conflicting opinions
on issues of doctrine, culled from the Fathers as a basis for discussion, of interest because
of the fact that there is no attempt to reconcile the different opinions), and a fragment of De Generibus
et Speciebus. That fragment, along with the psychological treatise De Inteilectibus, are considered
upon internal evidence not to be by Abelard himself, but only to have originated from his school.


Indeed, it appears that De Soto still had some distrust of his allies, whose presence was uninvited,
and with whose company he would gladly have dispensed. The more he reflected upon his situation,
the more embarrassing it seemed to him. He was entering a distant and unknown province, ostensibly
on a friendly mission, and it was his most earnest desire to secure the good-will and coöperation
of the natives. And yet he was accompanied by an army whose openly avowed object was to ravage
the country and to butcher the people.

The region upon which they first entered, being a border land between the two hostile nations,
was almost uninhabited, and was much of the way quite pathless. It consisted, however, of a
pleasant diversity of hills, forests and rivers. The considerable band of hunters which accompanied
the native army, succeeded in capturing quite an amount of game for the use of the troops.
For seven days the two armies moved slowly over these widely extended plains, when they found
themselves utterly bewildered and lost in the intricacies of a vast, dense, tangled forest,
through which they could not find even an Indian's trail. Very pleasing is the Hotel des Messageries,
here as well as the primitive areas discussed before, you are not
taken as a foreigner, but as a guest to be fussed over.

This delightful dispositon, posessed by all classes, will most likely become the much talked
about gossip, that can become tiresome.

The best speakers in the world, I truly think, are the Franc-Comtois, and any chance listener to
the conversation will not get away with ease. I will never believe that among eight thousand Indians there
is not one to be found capable of showing us the way to Cofachiqui. It is not at all likely
that you who have maintained perpetual war with that tribe, should know nothing of the public
road and secret paths leading from one village to another."

Patofa made the following frank and convincing reply.

"The wars that have been waged between these two provinces, have not been carried on by pitched
battles nor invasions of either party, but by skirmishes by small bands who resort to the streams
and rivers we have crossed, to fish; and also by combats between hunting parties, as the wilderness
we have traversed is the common hunting ground of both nations. The natives of Cofachiqui are
more powerful and have always worsted us in fight. Our people were therefore dispirited and
dared not pass over their own frontiers.

"Do you suspect that I have led your army into these deserts to perish? If so, take what you
please. If my head will suffice, take it; if not you may behead every Indian, as they will
obey my mandate to the death."

The manner of Patofa was in accordance with these feeling and manly words. De Soto no longer
cherished a doubt of his sincerity, and became also convinced that their guides were utterly
unable to extricate him. Under these circumstances nothing remained but blindly to press forward
or to retrace his steps. They at length found some narrow openings in the forest through which
they forced their way until they arrived, just before sunset, upon the banks of a deep and
rapid stream which seemed to present an impassable barrier before them. 

Despondence dead overcame him. He sat downward unexpectedly. "I'm unnerved I'm hump cracked,"
he groaned inconsolably.
"Like unsmooth!" repeated Abner in crack amazement. "Support, I snum!
Enjoy roughened!" 
Pilot Enoch glared at him viciously. To turn back was certain death by starvation; to remain where they
were was equal destruction; to go forward seemed impossible, for they had not sufficient food
to support them even while constructing rafts. Peter then knocks at your door. The door allows all.
Why is the door closed to better? We ask doesn't that nation make haste to Peter's entry? Why
does it let him escape Herod's prison?

"Strange, although this is Mary's house. Can Mary be the reason it opens so slow? Indeed that
reason is true, when Mary's damsel heard herself say she opened not the door for joy. She consequently
rand and told Mary. Mary then came with those that were with her,
and at first she thought twice, when Peter knocked.

She opened the door and took him in. She responded with no remorse, Herod was yet alive and
was king.

"Mary now holds joy, or is it misunderstood by fear? She now knows her fears. Why should Mary then fear
Herod's death?

The statement of God allows her to fear, God desired you, who are Peter's beloved child should give
share to the work with her. Do thou teach her now to cast said fears
away. It is not I who stood here, its not only Peter, Christ is with
us, as he waits with me until you take him in. Who are King of England,
are defender of faith; while you have the ambassadors of all princes
at your court. You wont have Christ's ambassador; you have Christ.

"Go
on upon your ways. De Soto then organized four bands of horse and two of
foot to go up and down the river, and to penetrate the interior, and to make as wide an exploration
as possible within the limit of five days. Each band was accompanied by a large number of natives.
Patofa himself went with one of these detachments. It shall occasionally happen, however, that
the installation ought be recharged or inspected as soon as nightfall. In order towards do this
within safety, a twice window, incapable of being unlatched, should
be installed within one wall of the house, as far as possible from
the door, and within such a grading that the light may dip onto towards
everybody the necessary places.

    Outside this window may be discontinued an ordinary hand- lantern
    burning oil or paraffin; or, preferably, round this window
    may be constructed a finished lantern into which a number
    of cause of artificial light may be brought.
     

    We cannot make every boy become an artist or cannoisseur. But
    can make him to understand the meaning of art in its
    rudiments. Make him modest enough to forbear expressing,judgements,
    which he has not knowledge. 157. Systematic teaching is very difficult
at present. These chivalrous spirits appreciated his care and
    kindness, and to solace him they concealed their sufferings,
    assumed an air of contentedness, and appeared as happy as
    though revelling in abundance."

was a town in which one commodity was mainly dealt. All of the commodity in all parts of England.
England had a particular town in which the principal market was for that town, just as with
us, the markets of footwear market in the US is supposed to be situated in Boston. the market of money in
NY. beef and hogs situated in Chicago .

In England however in the middle ages, they proved that certain trades should be housed in a particular
town. but not neccesarily being the only one. but very commonly put it in only that one. So from
then on they had particular places for the production of industry's who dealt in wool, you were
only allowed to trade wool in certain towns. After meeting for nearly seven hours the next day, when

I told them clearly that I chose not to do anything, because I was sick of the stupid company
that, having been a crime to tell the truth in their city better, I was willing to pay the penalty
for doing so, for privilege of leaving it, I was amazed and disgusted at the spectacle of a

 A shaped showed up in the raging storm from what seemed to be the
rear side of the central trench, and adressed us in a rather empty sort of a way by asking if
we knew of any mines in the vicinity. we first acknowledged that there might be one but not
knowing specifically we went back saying there might not be. He then inquired us that where do
we expect it to be in particular, to which we told him that it might be underground. he looked
skeptical and confessed that he had been ordered to find it. We later guessed that he was particularly
skilled at coal-minning, still was comfortable with the idea of finding
the quicker explosive and reactives, but soon found it to be on the
contrary when he asked for special equipments.

 Many bodies also placed themselves, their children, and their affiliated

the episcopate of Kerry became his.
Subsequent to this Mochuda, accepting committed the affliction of his corpuscle and archdiocese
to assertive pious and acceptable persons, set out himself, accompanied by a few disciples, through
the south of Munster to appointment the Abbey of Ciaran Mac Fionntan at Rosgiallan [Rostellan].
From Ciaran Mochuda enquired, where--in south Munster (as the angel had mentioned to Comghall)--the
arch and a lot of acclaimed of these churches should be. Ciaran, who bedevilled the spirit
of prophecy, replied--"You shall go aboriginal to Meath area you will begin a acclaimed abbey
in the area of Ibh Neill and there you will abide for forty years. You shall be apprenticed
accordingly into banishment and you will acknowledgment to Munster
wherein will be your greatest and a lot of acclaimed church."

Mochuda offered to abode himself beneath the advocacy and administration of Ciaran: "Not so, shall
it be," said Ciaran, "but rather do I put myself and my abbey beneath you, for ever, reserving
alone that my son, Fuadhran, be my almsman in this place." This Mochuda assented to and Fuadhran
absolute the apostolic city-limits for twenty years as Ciaran's almsman in the abbacy.
Next, Mochuda entered the area of the Munster Decies area dwelt the
Clanna Ruadhain who placed themselves and all their churches beneath

I need food for my people, and implore your assistance, by means of canoes and rafts, to cross
the river." 

At 0600, we mounted, but due to the rockbound landscape, we didn't reach the campground until 1230
hours. Prior to our arrival, the group had enjoyed much luck with their shooting and fishing; an
appetizing mix of cockatoos, swans, and ducks, along with fired fish,
was a gratifying welcome offering to us fater having survived for
weeks on salt-preserved meat and damper.

October 8th (Sunday).
October 9th
The river valley being craggy and obstructed to the North of camp,
we decided to cross to the left bank and climb the sandy plateau;
we headed roughly southeasterly from 0745 to 1100, at wich point we
happened upon the stream in an abyssal valley comprised of almost
vertical red sandstone escarpments 50-200 feet high, gapped at short
intervals by huge crevices (pointing generally WNW and at close to
right angles to the river), which time and water flow, had eroded
into impenetrable crevasses, often stretching more than a half-mile
back from the watercourse, and making traversal both laborious and
dangerous, as it was necessary to go around the dense thicket overlaying
the elevated land.

The flow of the river at this point altered to nearly South, and maintained its identical
rocky and unwelcoming aspect until 1700, when an interruption in the cliff walls gave us way to go
down into the valley, though with some challenges and risk to our mounts, which were forced to
slide down the highly inclined rockface in such a way that a wrong move would certainly cause
them a broken neck; however, the comedown complete, they were compensated with lush grasses
and abundant water, the latter coming from a generous spring lying
at the foot of the escarpment.

October 10th
While breakfast was being cooked, Mr. Burges and I took a look at the river's right bank, and
after a brief hunt, located a negotiable ascent to the cliff's summit,
and having made a clear path through the thick melaleuca that covered
the river bank, went back to camp to take breakfast.

At 0750, the began our ascent, and at 0830, reached the top for the craggy hills, and turning to
a Southeasterly course through series of thickets, boulders, wide crevasses, sand dunes, and
underbrush, we came out on a pleasant grassy plain at 1230. The river bed at this point exhibited
a marked change, the sandstone having given way to a granite gneiss, with dusky trap levees bisecting
it in a north-south direction, the concavity of the strata tending towards the West at a steep
angle, at some points virtually perpindicular.
A WAREHOUSE CAMP. EXPLORING NORTHERN MURCHISON.
October 11th
As this area showed promise as a location for the construction of
a warehouse, as we scrutinized the upper section of the Murchison,
I went further up the river with Mr. Burges, having commissioned the
remainder of our party to stand guard over the camp and to take care
of the horses.

After riding for an hour, we happened upon our own track which we had left when we traversed
the river on September 25th, the general path of the stream bed being ENE, its width averaging
300 feet, packed with stones, uprooted saplings, and shoals, with a plethora of superficial,
briny puddles, with only a single exception, was both broad and downreaching, where we stopped
for a couple of hours to give the horses a rest; very few of these
pools seemed substantial enough to survive the summer heat.

      

February 6, which was a Saturday, he seemed in good spirits. He and his doctors did not know
of his extremely critical state. As the pain became worse around midnight, his doctor was
called and the doctor gave him a morphia injection. As he lay down, he told his
attendants, "I will just rest here under this tree for a while. You go on and shoot instead. Just
leave this one slave with me." The attendants left and he soon fell fast asleep. The young
man slept for a long while, but was suddenly awakened when he felt something wet splash upon his face.

"Is
this rain?" he wondered. He ordered his slave to go and check for rain.

The slave obeyed, and returned with news of clear skies.

The young man, now confused said to his slave, "Then climb this tree and find out what this is."
Again, the slave obeyed and climbed the tree. It didn't take long for the slave to return and he
informed his master that a beautiful girl was in the tree, crying. And it must have been her
tears that had awakened the prince.

The young man asked his slave, "Why is she crying?"

The slave could not answer this question, he said, "I dared not ask. Perhaps you could ask her." So,
the curious prince climbed up the tree to ask her himself.

"Why are you crying?" the prince softly asked, which only made her
cry harder.

So he, not knowing what to do, continued, "Are you a
woman or a woodland spirit?"

"A woman," She whispered through her
sobs, wiping her eyes with a nearby leaf.

"Why are you crying?" He
asked again.

"For more reasons than you could possibly guess." Replied
the weeping woman.

"My house is nearby, come home with me, for I
am a prince." Suggested the prince.

"If you are a prince, what are
you doing in the woods?" She inquired.

"My friends and I come here
to shoot the birds," He answered, "but today I grew weary and stayed
behind to rest" 

I knowed the girl mentioned once by her good looks, and the old man of his grumpy-yallow frontispiece.
All of a sudden I take note of a Figs coming up from the cuddy, which I did right out of my
Master Down, in spite of his wig and a couple o 'high-heeled boots, then gave him the go to guy
treading among eggs.

When I hear him lisp like the skipper of the round-house if there was any fear of wind, that
was all I could do to keep the juice in my cheek. Away he goes up laughing, doing everything,
to look over the bulwark behind his girlfriend, givin 'me a glance over his shoulder. At night I
see the two holding a sort of a collogue rear wheel, when I was tricking
me at the helm.

After a while, there was a row arose among the passengers, with the old naboob and the skipper,
to find out who it was who held a song every night still in the first guard, next to the ladies'
cabin, under the stern deck. It could not be cleared up, hows'ever, who it was. All sorts o
'places they said it comed from - Mizen chains quarter-galleries, the lower deck ports, and davit boats.
But what do the old hunks most in a rage was, was the songs every man of them as "Rule Britannia",
"Bay of Biscay," "Britannia's bulwarks," and "All in the Downs." The Captain was at sea about
it, and none of the men would say something, by all accounts it was the best pipe on a sea-song
that should be heard. For my part, I knowed very well what was floating. One night a man comed
for'ard from the wheel, after steering his dog pass on, and "Well I'm blessed, fed, says he fok'sle,"
but the guy behind yonder with his wife - he of the greenest page
I've come to come over!

What d'ye think I hear him say to old Yallowchops one hour agone? '
 In the same
shelf there were several jars of glass, filled up by serpents of many sizes preserved in alcohol.
At the D.L.O. they received these snakes in two large tin cans, the ends were carefully perforated
to permit fresh air into the cans. They were sent to Germany for a professor. It was not sure
what office they had been sent to. In total there were seventeen, but some of the smaller ones
had died.

In the Dead-Letter Office there is system, industry and punctuality. Apparently it embraces every
other branch of business, and as you have seen, treating an unwelcome guest such as a nest of
live serpents is in a must-know basis.

HOW MOTHER ROBIN CALLED A NEW FRIEND. BY E.JAY EDWARDS

"Something special is held," he says dreamingly as he shows you the nest, "by this, if you would
like to know what it is, I will tell you."

My good friend begins to narrate- "It was many years ago that this nest was made. An early
morning in the month of April I was visited at the big fig tree that's in front of my window
by two robins. One of the robins had a club-foot and was hobbling around in a cheerful way.
I know it was this one. I call him, Mr. Robin. That's what chose the perfect spot for the nest.
As he sharpened his bill by a bough so many times, and danced upon
it first with one foot and then with the other.

It was as if he was checking the strength of it. Finally, he flew up to Mrs. Robin, who was
looking at him from above where he had been dancing. He was peeping the most gentle song that you
could imagine to Mrs. Robin. My window had been open and I could hear the concert. She then
joined him in the branch with a single jump, she rubbed her bill
on it and danced. He looked at her, and while doing so she would dance,
and then finished by singing the same little melody to him. When it
was over they flew away with great speed. The next time I saw them
they seemed as if they were working bees concealed in the bodies of
two robins. They brought twigs, and moss, and twine, and all sorts
of things until they had finished the nest they made." In admission of some attentions, Florence would be very insistant of everyone
to join him as a guest at a regular Italian lunch which would be spaghetti at Capronis on Wabash
ave. Naturally spaghetti was only the main course and there were
many other Italian delicancies Florence had ever heard of which he
would also eat. everything was rinsed down by unusual wines also from
Italy.

 During these times there was little that could be spared on luxuries.
A chronicle of the dieting habits of the Earl of Northumberland shows that in the cold season
his family ate mostly seafood. Their custom was to drench thier foods
in mustard. On some days the earl at mutton, and cow meat and drunk
wine. "Please
keep in mind that I'm always here for you when things get tough." I smiled, but my companion wasn't
moved. He always saw the subtle humor in anything that was said and replied, "Laughter is good
for the spirit and these poor rowers certainly could use it. Old
Bullen knows I'll be there when I'm needed." Collecting money for the church is not only
a daunting take, but can take you places you may never have frequented
before.

Muddy roads, isolated shoreline piers, desolate tenements and cottages nestled in the hills.
We've seen them all, and once there, we were made to scale ladders, delve into stench filled
cellars, and fend off angry canines protecting their territory, just to complete our mission.
We visited the teacher, the lawyer, the housewife, the farmer, and were welcomed by all, for
they knew our purpose.

People are like small streams, each taking their own path to the end, and this is more evident
when it comes time to giving alms. Some will have already put the check in the mail, while others
will stall as if you might change your mind, yet others make you endure an eternal wait while they
painstakingly fill in the check, as if to suggest it adds value to
the gift. One of these statues was twelve feet in height. Supporting the opinion I expressed
previously, Captain Wickham did not remark any above the entrance
of the river.

Mr. Clark shared the unique fact that a water-worn piece was found on a mountain over 25 miles
inland from Clarence River. The origin of this piece is unknown. It is possible that it was carried
by a native or floated there during a time of higher sea levels.  It was extremely difficult
to reach the highest point of the cape, which is over 2,000 feet
high. They
themselves, however, had not lost anything, and won a lot for the efforts they had made to cultivate
a greater openness to others, both in their marriages and relationships more broadly, and lovingly
invite more friends make the company itself.

It also would plead with friends to give greater support to, and carry out more active participation
in a project to provide marriage enrichment retreats for couples in the care of our meetings.

Some expressed views that suggest a particular reluctance among friends. There seems to be some basis
for two theories - first, that the Quakers tend to be very much involved
in social projects, sometimes to the detriment of their own family
relationships and, second, that tend to be somewhat puritanical in
the sense that considered irrelevant to his private life to others.

There may be a deep dichotomy in the attitudes of friends here as it happens for a couple: "vivid
impressions of the meetings honest between those who regard the worship of God as a private matter,
and those who feel the need to reach their community meeting personal support and a sense of
communion that includes a closer relationship with other friends. "
As with other friends, we are finding that these experiences can free up resources so far unrealized
and untapped spiritual strength and power.

As expressed by a couple: "For two years we have gone through a dark time in our family, trying
to find resources to deal with a seemingly insurmountable problem. In our first retreat, with
the loving support group, we were able as a couple to recover our self-esteem, sense of worth
and wellbeing, and reaffirm our forces to each other.
"The problem of the family has been happily resolved, and we found some extra strength to participate
fully in the expression of our concerns Quaker community in general.
 The wise and vigorous intellect of the great revolutionary leader,
the champion of the people in their struggle for civil and religious freedom, much as he could influence
the shapes of the ruling religious feelings, was too clever not to penetrate to be able, with
the help of the advice of the author of "Treatise of civil power in ecclesiastical affairs," who so
triumphantly confirmed the fundamental principle of Protestantism, [142] is somewhat below
the surface. In what way the Presbyterian Parliament issued orders for questions after the
crimes of witchcraft, how eager they were supported by clergy and people, like Matthew Hopkins
- immortalized in the annals of English witchcraft - exercised his
talents as a witch finder general facts are known.

[143]
[142] 'Seeing, therefore, "concludes Milton, the greatest English patriots can, like poets,"
that no man, no synod, no session of the men, though called the church to assess definitively
the meaning of Scripture to another man the conscience, as is known, a maxim of the Protestant
religion to have, it follows obviously that whoever is in religion that belief or opinions that appear
in his conscience and utmost understanding with most of the evidence or probability in the Scriptures
although it seems wrong to others, can not be censured for a heretic right than his critics, but the
same thing themselves, while they do it for so .... So to blame Protestants, whose common rule
and touchstone is the writing, nothing can with conscience, justice,
not Protestantly can be admitted as a free and lawful debate at any
time in writing, conference, or disputation of whatever controversial
comments from Scripture .... How many prosecutions, then, have detentions,
banning orders, penalties, and stripes, how much bloodshed, the pressure
pumps responsible conscience - and Protestants as Papists!

"(A Treatise of the civil power in ecclesiastical affairs.) The reasons which led Milton to
exclude the Catholics of his time from the general toleration are understandable and plausible
than the fifty or sixty years since, when the Rev. Sidney Smith published The letters of Peter Plymley.

[143] appears in the satire of Hudibras, especially in Part II, canto 3, Part III. 1, and the
notes by Zachary Grey.

The author of this amusing political satire has exposed the weaknesses of the great Puritan
party with all the rancor of a partisan.
The fact that the antagonists of the strenuous despotic dogmas, by whom were the principles
of English freedom opened for the first time that they leave their reason so fanatically to a
monstrous idea, is an additional proof of the universality of the superstitious prejudices. But
the conviction, the result of a continuing political persecution on religious grounds by their
teachings, that if heaven was on their side, Satan and the forces of darkness were more hostile,
completely, except by reference to these scenes of murder and torture
to be understood.

Hunted with the unrelenting cruelty like wild animals, and conventicles hold prayer meetings
with the sword hanging over their heads, it is not surprising that to believe at that time,
these English and Scottish Calvinists, they were the peculiar objects diabolical and human
wickedness come. may your whole story in the first eighty years of the seventeenth century alone
explain this belief. In addition to this real feeling, could the minister of the Presbyterian
sect interest in the maintenance of a creed, which must increase their credit as a miracle-worker.
[144]
[144] The author of Hudibras, in the interview of the knight and Sidrophel (William Lilly),
lists the various methods and uses of astrology and witchcraft in
vogue at the time, and from this Court and the Parliament deals with
the same zeal and emulation.

Dr. Zachary Grey, the sympathetic editor Hudibras, provides much curious information about this topic
in extracts from various ancient writers. "Parliament", as he says, "was a sure way to get all the
prophecies, to secure a miracle, and almanac messages of stars, &
c., here in favor of their own side, by the appointment of a licensor
of them, and strictly prohibited and punished as all were not allowed.
your man for this purpose was the famous Booker, an astrologer, fortune-tellers,
almanac-maker, & c. The words are very curious of his license in Rushorth
- for mathematics, almanacs and predictions.

    If we may believe summon Lilly, both he and Booker has
    also forecast for their friends and the Parliament. He tells
    us. "When he applied for a license to its Merlinus Anglicus
    Junior (in Rev. 1644) Booker was surprised at the book , made
    many bold obliteration, framed many objections, and swore it
    was not possible to distinguish between a king and a parliament,
    and recently licensed it for his own imagination.
     The chinking was all grey-blue
river mud, packed and dried. The cabin's windows were called 'chinkins' and the roof was made
of bark strips laid one over the other like shingles. The floor was laid with split logs, which
were superior to bark or dirt.

I liked watching carts come groaning up from the Red River piled high with furs, their drivers
ambling lazily alongside scrappy little oxen. Every once in a while, I'd see a cow pulling
a cart instead -- and once, a buffalo calf trailing along after them. I wondered if it was the
cow's weanling -- a cataloo, maybe, or a buffow.

The year I turned nine, my father sent me to fetch a bucket of water from the spring. As I was
coming back, bucket sloshing, I heard him call my name. Hastening my step, I found myself
abruptly surrounded by a band of Indians. They wanted my bucket but I would not let them have
it, and they were amused by my pluck. The chief traveling with them, a warrior by the name of
Little Crow, ordered me to give it to them too, but I said, "No, my father asked me to bring
this for him. You can't have it."

They laughed. Little Crow called me 'tonka squaw,' which I learned meant 'brave woman,' and they
left. Later, my father told me that they must have been on their way to a ceremonial dance
in Shakopee. He knew by their fanciful attire -- warbonnets, paints, chest pieces, and so
on -- and told me that if they had actually been out to war, they would have been wearing almost
nothing at all.

In 1843, I saw my first American soldiers. They
were from Fort Snelling and wore blue woolen uniforms with brass buttons.

The former will sometimes increase by way of wages to the latter, the increase based upon estimates of
the combined operations to which he may be entitled. This can take the form of money or food.

 Your rewritten version: Stage 2, returning to nature â Diderot, dâHolbch
and the materialists. â Theory of living matter and organization without creation. â Instinct
and morals in animal and the proper understanding of self-interest.

Now we begin our second study in philosophy. The study has two schools of thought: the first
are the so-called encyclopedists, with skeptics like d'Alembert,
others who believe in pantheism â like Diderot and Lamarck.

The second group are outright atheists and materialists like dâHolbach, Lamettrie and Helvetius,
followed by Concorcet, Lelande and Volney, all of whom are separate thinkers, but completely
agree that tradition is the common enemy. As a result of prolonged argument and disagreement and
their natural desire to be in control of everything and beat down
opponents, all these parties soon become increasingly frustrated.

They will not agree that Reason and tradition can be mutually supportive. They feel that when one
enters, the other must leave. All this leads to the building of one prejudice against another. Voltaire,
for example, has not desire to forget all about God, rather to keep Him around as a memory of
past superstition and the good He did for mankind. But we should look closely at this superstition,
which is so childlike. We accept it through faith, but faith should be regarded with suspicion.
Faith comes through ignorance, fear, and imagination, all of which
are powers in man that are deceptive. What this boy and a girl, said to each other, their secret
is not ours.
The high Paddock gorse was a fox, and many actually have a woman who raised a young family well
there without any concern for your support, thanks to offers of crows
and rabbits, obsequiously placed at his door by his best friend ,
and its most implacable enemy, Mr. William Kirby, MFH In recognition
of these attentions, no doubt the lady in question allowed one of
his sons to give a harmless pleasure to his benefactor, and this has
been a lively gallop around two miles, finished in an orchard, where
was the place of safety he had been informed that a beginner, and
ended with success, in an hour, which made a late breakfast at the
castle in Ireland an obvious question, even crucial for those not
willing to wait, patient hunger worse food, an early lunch.

Ms. Kirby Young had not lost to marriage, the habit of having his own way.
"No Christian, I do not want to go home. You have not seen the baby, and he really looks very
nice in their new - "(a small matter, regardless of the formulas are slightly varied dress) -" and
besides, "continued the young lady Kirby,: with the decision "I want to talk with you."

with "jailer's daughter," as a method to obtain information.

Christian trembling for the secret of the pearl.
"Bill tells me," began Judith, after breakfast, afternoon had been transferred, luxury resolve

Certainly the business was worthless when his horse was dead, but I do not think - Bill was right
to advise Fairfax old Dad to do something about it - but if this nonsense archaic feudal feeling
and no sale of the property. Of course he is bound to lose the sale, but the longer you wait
the worse it becomes.
"I do not think it is only feudal feeling - he says he can not afford to sell," began Christian.

"Oh, I know all this, dear," interrupted Judith, " infernal mortgagees, and condemned the charges
and that black rebel guard, young Mangan, who cut the grass under
their feet "and so on.

I've heard all of Papa, only five thousand times. But the point is that there was a meeting in
Pribawn, with the pastor in his chair, and there was a furious argument, and there was talk of
boycotting the pope, and some steps should be taken. It is an intolerable nuisance to be boycotted,
if nothing else, and expensive. O'Donnell I was with when they were boycotted - up at five in the
morning to milk cows and light the fire in the kitchen and get all the things of the earth in the
mail from London! "
"I will take as many steps as you want," said Christian, "if you just want me to take."
 Sometimes, but very rarely, she had dreams of pleasant feelings

Mode.--Once you boil the potatoes, mash them into a smooth flat surface that does not contain lumpps.
After that is completed, you can then put them to the boiling stock. This portion of the task,
you are going to pass it through a sieve, and season the potatoes. Allow them to simmer for
at least 5 minutes. Skim them well once that is completed and serve the dish with fried bread.

Time:
The time limit for this dish should take about 1/2 hours.

Average cost: $10.00. per quart.

     
     In season between March and September.
     
     Serving Size: Approximately 8 per.

     peas, 2 oz. off of a celery head.

Salt and pepper will be needed for seasoning.

Preparation: Place the 3 quarts of water into a sauce pan. Cut the beef into very slin slices.
You will also want to cut the potatoes and onions. Gather the rice, peas, beef, potatoes,
and onions, then place them into the sauce pan. Continue to stew the mixture until there is
a gravy like substance drawn from the meat. After you see the gravy pulling from the beef, remove
the meat and place the other ingredients into the content through a coarse sieve. Pulp and celery
can be placed into the soup, simmer until it is softended and tender.

Serve with fried bread chopped into it for best results.

Time needed:
Approximately 3 hours

Average cost: $4.00 per quart

In season from
September to March.

Serving size: Approximately 12 per.

Ingredients:
4 medium sized potatoes well cooked, a thick slice of bread, 6 leeks
that are cut into thin slices (cut into as far as white extends from
the roots). Get a tea size cup full of rice, a tsp of salt, and 1/2
a tsp of pepper. 

Mode.--Place contents into water once it begins
to boil. Place potatoes, bread, leeks in pepper into the pan. Once
contents start to simmer and become tender, you then can add salt,
pepper and rice. Here we have been strolling all over for two years, and never
have been able to get close to them French, to have a built fight says Paul as he and Abel
Bush and others were stretching on the forecastle. Eliab Hill looked nonplussed and said "Well, it certainly doesn't look
that way to me. What do you mean by 'idle' tears? It sounds like the author doesn't understand
or empathize with the person who is upset".

His teacher, Miss Mollie, looked back at him and responded, "Couldn't he have had a deeper meaning?
Perhaps he understands more than you are suggesting."

He replied, "That's my point. I want to understand what he means. If I knew the man personally,
I might be able to grasp what he's trying to say. You understand
him more fully because you've had a similar background.

You're the same class and the same race, but that's not the case
with me.

He may as well be speaking another language as far as I'm concerned."

The mediocre Black student thought hard about what the author was trying to say, and contemplated
the philosophies of the author.

His teacher thought that he was acting strangely and asked him why.

The man felt a rise of emotions and blushed and fidgeted. He then looked up towards his teacher,
steeled his shoulders, and said with resolve "When the author talked about the election and
horse coming back, you understood it right away". He paused, and then continued to say "You knew
that white people would have a problem with the parade, which would lead to trouble. I didn't think
of that.

    I just thought how great it would be to be free, with our own
    music, and march with our own flag, and do the work of
    free citizens. That was all."
    
    Miss Mollie pointed out that Nimbus had considered it and that was
why he had returned the horse.

He replied by saying "No, that's not right. He was just afraid they would tease the horse, causing it
to escape and be injured. We Black people didn't ponder what the whites would feel because there
was no way for us to know. You knew because you're a part of that culture".

She wondered why the discussion was bothering him so much, so she asked him.

"Well, I had always thought that getting an education involved applying yourself and learning
facts, but it now seems like more than that. I'm not sure how far I can go." he said ruefully.

She
responded by saying "You aren't becoming disheartened, are you? What else can you do?"

He looked at her and said "I'm not discouraged for myself. I enjoy my studies either way. But
I'm worried about the others, Miss Mollie. I need to think of my people, who are like straight
young saplings. You taught me that men can only be made free by knowledge. The law is simply
an opportunity to better ourselves. Freedom is something you earn for yourself, not something that
someone else can give you."

"Well, Eliab, that's true", she said. She looked at his face, which was flushed with emotion and
intensity as he contemplated his education. She almost forget his physical weakness for a moment,
as it seemed inconsequential in light of his words. "Don't be discouraged,
just think about how far you've come. You're further along towards
becoming a truly free man than you might think. You should be very
proud of what you've learned so far." 

"Ha", he said, "well, I was
just doing that for me, not for the common good of my people. What
do I mean to them?". Glancing down at his frail legs he said, "I am
not the least of them..." and buried his face in his hands with the
shame that disability all too often brings. 

The teacher attempted
to console him by saying "You shouldn't think like that. You should
conquer those thoughts and use your talents to become an inspiration
to Black people everywhere".

Eliab sighed and raised his head and
said "No, there isn't all that much for me to look forward to in the
world. I am just dust on the Lord's chariot wheels, after all, which
needs to be brushed aside so His glory can shine through. My only
obligation is to help my people, and that's what I wanted to talk
to you about tonight. It's difficult to articulate, but I have to
say it. I feel like I've been taking too much of your time and energy".

"That's
not true, Eliab", she interrupted, confused.

"No, no, I have," he
said impatiently, blushing. He carries a lot of honor according
to the original sense of it which among the elders, Gellius says, signaled wound. His success
was greater than he could bear in his mind, and he got drunk off
of it; and if he should sleep as long as Epimenides or the Seven Sleepers,
he would never see sobriety again.

He took his degree and proceeded lord by mandamus, without meritable exercise. His honour only
comes from worth, and his nobility a dispensation for doing ignoble things. He is sure that
men's hats should fly off in front of him as if a storm, and not stand in his way of prospect,
which is always above them. All of his advantage is to go or sit before, in which neither parts
take his upper's place, that still continue, but average people.
 

The hands of the strange woman were clasped on her breast, and even when the rest of us made for Jabez
she remained still.

Chapter 29 - The Final Reckoning

In defeat, the light goes out of your foe's eyes, be it human or animal. In the aftermath of my "victory,"
I feel a hollowness, and would gladly welcome a contest that ended in a draw.

That was how Jabez looked to me, collapsing on the padded bench, his inner steel snapped in
two. His hands dangled slack between his knees, but the worst of it was his eyes -- glazed and pitiful,
they cried to my heart, and I could feel myself wanting to send him a measure of strength.

But that was me. It was different for the woman at the door. It was precisely that look that
aroused her dubious maternal instincts. That momentary lapse into
helplessness.

It was only this that took her across the room, where she took his hand and implored him, "George,
you mustn't give up now."
George now had someone holding both his hands, since Barbie had the
other. He looked at his two saviors and let the tears overfill his
eyes and course down his cheeks. Friar Tuck rescued me, and Jim as
well, from the excesses of emotion -- putting a hand on each of our
shoulders, he said Jabez and his two companions would get along fine
without us and urged us outside to await their call, if ever it were
to come.

His guidance was welcome, and with no further urging we
sidled to the door, passing old Melisse as we went. We were shown some of the incredible drawings of Sir Robert,
at only twenty he was alread gaining an artist's reputation and getting attentions of West and
Shee. What a wonderful way to pass the hours.His picture of Storming of Seringapatam, which was
already know around half the world, was inspired and explained to us.Let us tell you though,
the Porters spoke only kindly of each other, without the family ego
others show.They lavished praise on others work while never mentioning
their own or each others.They told tales of pleasure in their trips
to London, against their mothers advice that young ladies with out
wealth should live a calm and quiet life in the country, staying far
from the temptations of luxury and city life.We smiled at the thought"young
ladies" that was 22 years ago and Jane Porter was 75 when she died.

They shared much about their former life at Thamed Ditton, the sweet neighborhood they loved.
However both their mother's health and their's had improved since the move back to Esher-hill,
to their little garden backed up to beautiful Claremont park.The front of the house overlooked
the roads leading to the town broken up by the village green and
statly elms.

 The purpose of this last notice is to
prove Mr. Peacock wasn't quite on the mark in his chronology, or his overview of Shelley and
Harriet's split. Alluding either to the discretion that thwarted Shelley from gaining the trust
of Mr. Peacock, or to his sadness of the fate of Harriet, the author refers to "the proof
that is evident in a series of letters written by Shelley at the instant of trust with someone,
and in the presence of his family".  "Nothing more fluent or charming ever flowed from his
pen; and the grant undeniable proof of the grief and pain of that terrible moment that they tell
of. Yet, self reproach showed no element of his sorrow, which, within he could say "____ ____",
mentioning the names of two unbiased businessmen, "everyone does
me justice, bears testament to the liberality of my conduct toward
her."

In the "Memorials" and the "Relics" there is no difference to the circumstances that happened
just before Harriet's suicide; but it appeared to me very likely that the story should have
been brought out better, and I can explain why I feel this way. The letters in question took
place in the middle of December, 1816. Shelley was married to Mary a while later; and in the
most emphatic way, he kept the conversation of his host secret, similar
to the way my father spoke of Mary.

My own memory goes back to that time, and I have already questioned
the state of Shelley's mind.

He was trying to get his children back, and thought that in the event of his marriage, he
would be able so.
Let me pause for a moment, as it contains two facts of similar interest. On one hand, it shows
a great friendship and confidence shared between my father and Mary. On the other hand, it also
expresses the sensitivity, quick tempered, and outspoken ways of
both. The difference between History
and Poetry is this. History is concerned with the truth of the human experience in the particulars,
but Poetry is concerned with the truth of the human condition in
a general, even philophical light. Sometimes
in Brighton? There it's t 'other way. '
Shortly after he mentioned the evening time for their entry into the
harbor Harwich, coach quietly turned over to the side of the road,
the imposition of outside passengers quite safely, in the matter-of-course
so that only the cries of injured lady inside their suppressed roar
of laughter.

One round had released half a kilometer from the nearest town. Their entry into Harwich was postponed
by up to half-past nine in the night. Full consideration for new friends quickly married his
heart in the accident. Matthew Shale suggested Matthew Weyburn, the ferry crossing point to bother
with a portmanteau and a bag at this late hour, for support in his home, try the nearby pub
for a short sleep, and ship on board his yawl, honest, Susan, to be rowed ashore off Swine Felixstowe
to sand than six hours on a summer morning, in time for bathing and swimming before breakfast. It sounded
good - it sounded sweet.

Weyburn proposed counterclaim for dinner for three at the inn. But other Matthew said: "I
married a cook. She expects a big appetite, and she always kept warm, when I 'm held away, no
matter how late. Make sure that is enough. '
The beds were secured at the inn, after which came the beginning of Mrs. Shale, Shale Susan

grog, tobacco, and the rest at the inn, and stunning blow on the door

to knock.

     Young Matthew Shale, who slept on board the Susan, he conducted
     them to the ship. His view was very much attention to white
     duck trousers made of Weyburn, the souvenir of approbation
     they won at Marlow. They were on, and so it was useless, young
     Matthew saying they were likely to carry a token away from Susan.
     She was one of the girls paint, and without chips, particularly
     immaculate.
     As it happened, nobody saw, but everyone saw how naturally
     must occur for the white ducks that I'd have in your eye 'when
     they were on board a quarter of an hour. Weyburn had some
     fun of them, as a counterweight to the twitch of a sentimental
     regret barely decipherable, as a last sight of him should
     bear the form of memories of Brown's first.
     Beautiful red morning sun and open sky to the sea, persecuted all
the little thoughts of her.

The breeze was from the west, and Susan, lightly loaded, took a groundswell of smooth cylinder
with a flowing stream-bob in motion its velocity. Front-aft sail and were on their fine strain,

They passed a British defensive strength, and spared its walls, in obedience to Matthew Shale
good advice that they should refrain from sneezing. Little Collett pointed to the roof of his mother's
house twenty paces to the rear belt tamarisks, green in the middle
of the hollowed yellows shorebanks still in shadow, crumbling into

His nephew displays much of his skeptical manner. In fact, his attitude almost made him lose
his life. The local people of Touraine concluded that they should stone him since his arrival brought

However, as I intended to say was shortly after news reached a "you have sailed for India, that
a fire to die" nicht in a house occupied by the father of Katie Alison . I will never forget
an uproar and consternation "that terrible nicht. There was a look in town, but was pale wi
'terror.

Flames roared and hit every window, and were visible in some parts of the roof. a large cloud
of black smoke "hurry appeared in a volcanic crater. The story" the second floor were falling and
crashing, and crackling, and burning large sparks, some a 'them as big as a human hand, were
growing in thousands and tens "of thousands of burning ruins, and were led by wind, a shower a"

But this has not was the worst o't, for, in a third floor window, which was the only house in which
flames were bursting was Katie Alison Bonny, wringing her hands and cries for assistance, while gowden
shouthers hair fell over her, and her cries were heard angry aboon a "conflagration.
 

Thou ought take them one via one, and within their order, child, however sorely tempted towards

Keep thine eye and thy labor for the closest one, and at last the red-winged goose itself

Mihal heard and treasured up the Dwarf-king's mandates, spoke his mere thank you, bowing low,
and, as soon as a gay farewell towards the little old woman whom
had been his jackdaw, went his distance into the upper air; and just
as the sun emerged, touching the pine-tree tops with flame, he arrived
towards his father's hut, whereas the eight children were stroking
their eyes and Zitza crying for her breakfast.

No one knew that Mihal had been further than the door-sill, nor did he tell the clamorous brood
of children what he had sighted, lest they should mock it as a dream, or tackle the activity
themselves.
So he went patiently approximately his profession, assisted them glance for Meister Hans, whom
everybody mourned for a lot a day,--excepting Mihal, whom well knew how much better off the
jackdaw was than within any of the pitiful moods they fancied, and the parents, whom were
too grateful towards benefit even the bird's low share of bread for their wasted and fretful
children.

But as soon as nightfall Mihal crept lightly from his straw within the corner, tied a sheep-skin
across his shoulders, and, with his uneaten supper, a crust of black bread, within the bosom
of his ragged shirt, stole lightly out of the door towards seek his
fortune.

About two miles from the hut there was a noticeable space within the pine forest, whereas there
stood a great masonry cross, at the foot of which a small spring slept within the grass, and
overflowed lightly onto the crisp turf at everybody seasons. At this site Mihal decided towards
wait for the flight of the red-winged goose, and he knew the forest channels so well that a short
half-hour carried him towards the open glade. He knelt and washed his face within the spring,
drank deeply of its pure and relaxed waters, and otherwise leaned back against the foot of the cross
towards devour his crust and wait till moon-ris

 On the one sidelong the impalpable skill of Old Humanity diplomacy was toiling velar and

opposite help the New World policy, naÃ¯vely ignoring humanities forces and secular prejudices,
was boldly stretch out toward nonslippery and primed modes of composing things and winning

statesmanlike stagers and both secretly strove to concord hastily
nonvoluntary bargains outside the Council chamber with their opponents.

As former as the premiere days of January I was time at whatever epistolatory meetings where much
transactions were state talked over, and I afterward gave it as my feeling that "if things go progressive
as they are vibrating to-day the outcome leave shine far  squatty of sensible expectations.
The prototypic striking difference between the transatlantic idealists and the Old World politicians
lies in their different distance of appreciating expeditiousness, on the one handsbreadth, and
the bases of the Dweller state-system, on the additional script. A pol when handling with imperative,
especially subversive, emergencies should never submit his eyes from the measure. The politicians
in Paris scarce e'er avow reason of  experience or possibleness.

fuddle that the law of construction, far from having spent its oblige, console affords the exclusive
groundwork of world unchangeability and requires to be more intensified."[104]  Experience in

devoting dimension and toil to the penning of machinery for the pleasing polity of the total
hominian canal out of spare and not completely eligible materials,
a scholar in proximity of the increase inconsistent forces at output
would make plant it problematical to summary them all and set the
regular incidents and primary questions in turn perspective.

The trait and good-will of the plenipotentiaries were highly praiseworthy and they themselves,
as we saw, were most  hopeful. Nearly all the delegates were characterized by the tone of compromise,
so valuable in vulgar opinion, but so perilous in embodying ideals. Eager to stretch unanimous
decisions plane when unanimity was missing, the corpus statesmen boldly had assist to creative
formulas and conditional agreements, which apiece set mightiness
see in its own way, and postpaid deficient attending to what was effort

I wrote at the quantify:[105]
"But nonintersecting with the Conference and the daily lectures which its members are receiving

others privately, which represent the vast masses who are in a greater motion than the semipolitical

"Well, I have to admit that it appears to me that it will indeed sound better," he said. "A

"But, my beloved pater, what is all this really about?" A few tribes, including the Abirianos and the Maquiritares, live in the mountains. However,
neighboring savannahs,* delineated by the Cassiquiare, the Atabapo, the Orinoco, and the Rio
Negro, are completely devoid of human inhabitants. (* The rivers form a four-sided figure
of a thousand square leagues, whose opposite sides are of opposite slopes. In the configuration,
the Cassiquiare flows towards the south, the Atabapo towards the north, the Orinoco towards
the northwest, and the Rio Negro towards the southeast.) In this area, crudely etched drawings
of the sun, the moon, and different animals can be found on granite rocks, evidencing the prior
presence of a people, not similar to those discovered to have lived
on the banks of the Orinoco. It's easy to see, actually, that arrogance and disdain are the strongest weapons when
arguing and that it's the weaker side that needs to absorb the negative statements and perhaps
set those who hold them straight. "What? Are you afraid you'll

* * * * *  THE NATURALIST.

* * * * *  NEW ZOOLOGICAL WORK.  We are happy to have on our table the first number of
a periodical work to be exclusively devoted to the Illustration of the Natural History of the
living Animals in the Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society. It is from the Chiswick press;
the drawings are by Mr. William Harvey, and the Engraving by Messrs.
Branston and Wright; and of printing and embellishment, the present
number is a truly splendid specimen, and is equal to any of the costly
"Annuals."

The proceedings of the Zoological Society are, regularly reported in the Zoological Journal,
it is valuable and clever as may be this work, it is not calculated for extensive reading. We are
pleased, with the appearance of "The Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society," which
is popular and scientific. It is published with the sanction of the council, and is superintended
by the learned secretary.The present number contains Engravings and Descriptions of the Chinchilla,the
Ratel; the Wanderoo Monkey; the Hare-Indian Dogs, the Barbary Mouse; the Condor; the Crested
Curassow; the Red and Blue Macaw; the Red and Yellow Macaw.The Quadrupeds are, , the most successful
. Of the literary portion of the work we intend to present our readers
with a specimen in our next number.

We believe the sale of works on Natural History to have been very limited; this has probably
arisen from their technical character, and consequent unfitness for the general reader. Mr. Loudon was,
, the first to familiarize the study of Zoology, in originally making it a portion of his
excellent Gardeners' Magazine. The formation of the Zoological Society next rendered the study
more popular, and the gardens in the Regent's Park at length made it fashionable, and ensured
it patronage. About this time Mr. Loudon commenced his Magazine of Natural History, which has been
very successful: it is one of the most unique works ever published,
both as regards the spirit and research of the intelligent editor,
and the good taste with which the work is illustrated--the latter
being a very important feature of a work on Natural History.

* * * * *  CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF AN OYSTER CATCHING THREE MICE; AND A LOBSTER CATCHING AN OYSTER.
(For the Mirror.)  Borlase, in his Natural History of Cornwall, page 274, says, "The oyster
has the power of closing the two parts of its shell with prodigious
force, by means of a strong muscle at the hinge; and Mr. Carew, in
his Survey of Cornwall, 1602, with his wonted pleasantry, tells us
of one whose shell being opened as usual at the time of flood, (when
these fishes participate and enjoy the returning tide) three mice
eagerly attempted to seize it, and the oyster clasping fast its shell,
killed them all.

It not only shuts its two valves with great strength, but keeps them shut with equal force, and
(as I have been informed by a clergyman of great veracity, who had the account from a creditable
eye-witness to the fact) its enemies have a skill imparted to them to counteract this great
force. As he was fishing one day, a fisherman observed a lobster attempt to get at an oyster

the lobster having awaited with great attention till the oyster opened again, made a shift to throw

INSTINCT OF SPIDERS.  (For the Mirror.)  The following fact is copied from a French work entitled
Archives sur Anatomie:--"A spider at the height of about nine feethad
spread its net between two neighbouring trees."

 They'd never really liked her and in fact had been
     somewhat afraid of her, even though she was an abused child
     who they saw roaming on the rocks and on the beach scavenging
     for her meager intake in ways they never had to think about.
     She never spoke to them and so they never knew why her
     grandfather, or only existent family member, treated her so
     badly.

     That ill treatment was the main reason she was such a pariah to the
others. He was
     disconcerted in his favorite scheme of colonization, and had
     lost confidence in his followers. I will be largely in your debt
     should you remember this school and its popular activities
     in the coming number of the G.O.P., as I am afraid that

meat and other eatables such as sound could be simply boiled or roasted, were gilded over. In
such an entertainment expense must have been huge, and when we add, that most of the gift value
was much higher than today, and that in addition to groom presents, Giovanni Galeazzo gave away
150 beautiful horses, and his relative, Bernabo, jewelry and gold coins at a great value, the
full amount paid, on this occasion it seemed so huge to make a doubt a small sovereign might indeed
allow such blatant waste.

But when you consider that the flourishing state of commerce in Italy pointed out there all
the wealth of Europe, we are not surprised at an expense that, however great, could, at that time
were not supported by a reigning Duke of Milan and Florence alone, but even by many citizens
of various Italian republics.
During the feast, many many Jesters, mimes, and all sorts of trick play, fun company with their
gambols as was noise from trumpets, drums, and other martial instruments by vociferation of
performers and applause audience, that no single voice could be heard
and compare them with contemporary history of a sea of wild laughter.

ECONOMY-banking in Russia. 
Until 1825, no savings, no bank in Russia.
Farmers and peasants, who reside mostly in isolated and dispersed
housing were used to keep their little store of money in common clay
pots buried underground, where it was stolen unfrequently. 

One of the most telling stories of Lord Eldon's patronage of the church can be found in the
letter from a letter anonymously written by his eldest son. The letter is from No. 2, Charlotte
Street, Pimlico addressed to the Chancellor:

"Hear, generous lawyer! hear my prayer, Nor let my freedom make, you stare, In hailing you Jack
Scott! Tho' now upon the woolsack placed, With wealth, with power, with title graced, Once
nearer was our lot.

"Say by what name the hapless bard May best attract your kind regard-- Plain Jack?--Sir John?--or
Eldon? Give from your ample store of giving, A starving priest some little living-- The world will
cry out 'Well done.'

"In vain, without a patron's aid, I've prayed and preached, and preached and prayed-- Applauded but
ill-fed. Such vain Ã©clat let others share; Alas, I cannot feed on air-- I ask not praise,
but bread."

Upon receiving the letter and being hoaxed, the Chancellor travelled to Pimlico to find the poet,
but to no avail.

Another less humorous anecdote is the tale of Miss Bridge's morning call to Lord Eldon. One
morning while he was sitting in his study, a youthful girl, dressed in a rustic manner, nervously
approached the lawyer. He turned to see her and rose from his chair. He bowed and asked, "who
are you?" and she responded, "Lord Eldon, I am Bessie Bridge of Weobly,
the daughter of the Vicar of Weobly, and papa has sent me to remind
you of a promise which you made him when I was a little baby, and
you were a guest in his house on the occasion of your first election
as member of Parliament for Weobly."

The chancellor though back and attempted to recall what sort of promise he had made that the
girl was referencing. He asked her what this promise was and she
responded, "You were standing over my cradle when papa said to you,
'Mr. Scott, promise me that if ever you are Lord Chancellor, when
my little girl is a poor clergyman's wife, you will give her husband
a living;' and you answered, 'Mr. Bridge, my promise is not worth
half-a-crown, but I give it to you, wishing it were worth more.'"
Lord Eldon, appearing to have remembered this, excitedly replied that
the girl was right and admitted the obligation he had once made. He forgot to execute this promise, but it appeared that the location was not
difficult to find, as it was marked by the large finger-post of Mount Camanti. The explorers
placed the precious specimens in the baggage, and continued to advance along the valley.
The rocks and hard landscapes were left in the distance, and the footing became more level and
easy to walk through, as they found themselves on a soft, slippery sand. Clumps of giant reeds
appeared every few feet. Well-defined geometric forms, made by natural forces dotted the distance.
In the native garden-beds, the drifting sands resembed artifical paths.
As they traveled through the labyrinths of strange gardens, they were surprised by the last hours
of daylight. They chose a suitable spot to rest. The Indians, upon learned that their travels
were stopping for the night, panicked and made their discomfort known
to the interpreter.

They warned that it was impossible to camp out in the neighborhood of the dreaded animal.  
But
Pepe Garcia, who was used to fighting ferocious animals like bears, was not the sort of man
to be afraid of a tiger, even the genuine famed Bengal tiger.
To prove to the porters how unafraid he was of the tiger, he pushed the group into the thickest
part of the reeds and ordered them to cut down the canes to make sheds. He used his own knife
to cut down canes, and forced the Indians to make them into sheaves
and transport them to the beach for the campsite.

Double rows of the arundos, driven into the sand, formed the layout for cabins, the leaves made
walls and roofs. The green halls with matted vaulted ceilings were picturesque; and each Indian,
seeing how easily these houses were built, selected to make a house for himself. The Tiger's
Beach quickly became a campsite, in a long straight line, with the Indians occupying the houses
on the far end near the river.
No tiger appeared that night, but the Indians were instead afraid
of birds.

The night passed calmly without incident.
Due to the layout of the landscape, either because of the valley, or the decrease in altitude, the
travelers were often hindered by fog at night. The animals of the area were rather tame, with the
occational tapir or otter or fish, shot for food.
To-night, however, the scariest animal of the tropical forest appeared on the campsite. As
the Indian servants lied down to sleep under the partial shelter
of their tents, a vampire bat, which was attracted to the smell of
their bodies, flew over them.

The bat selected a person to attact, and flew over the man's exposed foot, and bit his big
toe. The bat was able to gorge itself on blood without disturbing the sleeping man.
 How many men do we find that resemble Blanchot? After having been governor, for a long series
of years, he died without fortume. 
That which is worth taking,
is worth keeping, everybody knows a popular proverb. When theorizers want to visualize the types of beings earthlings could run in to
when visiting other worlds in our solar system, they often use math to figure gravitational
forces and utilize scientific data to come up with the size, strength, and form of such creatures.
This is all dine, but the very first bit of data they should consider is the length of the year
of the planet in question and the workings of the seasons there. For example, Mars and Venus
rotate on schedules that are not very different from Earth; therefore,
life on these two might be theorized as similar to that on Earth.

If this rotation was vastly different, than the life on that planet could also be expected
to be dissimilar.
Two important facts cannot be ignored. First, the way we conceive of time depends on the Nature
of the Law of Periodicity. Second, periodicities which determine the types of animal and plant
life on our planet are the periodic movements of the planet. Thus, these should be applied to
other planets as well.

The Cacique returned favorable replies, and sent to De Soto in return fruit, fish, and venison. There
was a great gathering of cloud that completely obliterated the light of the moon, and the deathly stillness
of the earlier evening was now gone as a harsh wind and heavy rain developed. It was a mournful
time. The dogs were fast approching their victim, and he felt only death and despair surround
his being. Suddenly the ground became varied and irregular, and he began to feel hope settle in
his being that he might be getting near the moors. But he still had no idea of his whereabouts.
Suddenly there was a cloudburst and he was threatened with the rain that he had known was surely
coming, instantly Smyth was soaked through, he felt his footing begin to slip on the wet and
treacherous ground.

and paiting philippe Berthelot. I Ascertained and felt that she was weighing
the manginess of my clothes versus my qualifications, and I trembled since the consequence. In
a short time my biggest fearfulnesses were realised; for, one day,
calling up as usual, rather than being shown into a little front room,
where I imparted my lessons, the man-servant, who opened up the doorway,
allowed me to stand in the antechamber, and in two minutes came back
with two guineas on a little silver collection plate, suggesting,
as he held them in front of me, that 'the services of Mr Rutherford
were no longer necessitated.' The vision of the two guineas took away
the resentment and humiliation of the sudden judgement of dismissal.

I pocketed them, and hired a lodgement; and never, until that night, did I acknowledge or experience
the beautiful opulence of an abstruse, untroubled slumber. It was bathing in the River Lethe, and
arising freshened, having no consciousness, save the grateful feeling of the cooling waters
of forgetfulness around me. Having a few weeks ago interpreted an old deed, which was scripted
in Latin, for a gentleman who is what is called an in-door counselor-at-law, and who holds
an extensive practice, he has been pleased to take me into his business
office, and has fixed on me a handsome remuneration.

He suggests me to labor my way to the bar, and kindly assures his help. I shall abide by his
advice, and I despair not but I might one day solicit the hand of the only woman I ever have admired,
or may love, from her father, as his equal. I am, sir, yours, indebtedly, "ALEX. RUTHERFORD."

Now, sir (continued the dominie), almost 3 years after I had got this letter, my old scholarly
person was called to the bar, and a magnificent debut he made. Bench, bar, and jury were bewildered
in admiration at the power o' his eloquence.

A Demosthenes had climbed up up amidst them. The one-half o' Edinburgh spoke o' naething but the young
counselor-at-law. But it was on the very day that he made his debut as an advocate, that I
got a letter from Mr. Crompton, imploring to know if I could gie him ony information concerning
the aged tutor o' his family, and expressing, in the linguistic communication
o' a heartbroken gentleman, that his only girl was then upon her death-bed,
and that, before she passed away, she prayed she might be allowed
to see and to speak with Alexander Rutherford.

I enveloped the letter, and posted it off to the young counselor-at-law. He was seated at a dinner,
welcoming the homage of beauty and the felicitations of knowledgeable men, when the fateful
letter was put into his hands.

He broke away the seal--his hand juddered while he read--his cheeks turned pale--and enormous
drops of perspiration burst upon his forehead. He got up from the table. He barely knew what he did.
But within half-an-hour he was on his way to Cumberland. He arrived at the household, her parents
welcomed him with tears, and he was lead into the room where the deceasing maiden lay down. She
acknowledged his voice, as he came near.

"He is come!--he is come! He loves me still!" Shouted the poor thing, striving to raise herself
upon her elbow joint.
Sandy came near the bedside--he broke into tears--he bent down, and kissed her colorless and
bony cheeks, over which death appeared already to have cast its darkness.
"Ann! my darling Ann!" said he; and he took her hand in his, and pressed it to his lips; "don't
leave me--we shall nevertheless live happy!"
Her eyes lightened up for a moment--in them joyfulness fought with death, and the competition was
unbalanced.

 Revelations of life, especially those that have the truest and most permanent validity

at the expense of their own lives, at all times without regard for
antagonism and ridicule. 

Dr.Jamees A. Bayard, was a descendent of the famous "Chevalier" Bayard, a fact that exuded great
influence on the members of his family in their public life including his son to a great extent.
James A. Bayard, thus declined a French mission offered to him, stating that he feared it may come under
suspicion of a deal being made. In a letter to a relative, he expressed that he shall never
compromise on the great name he belonged to and he would not find satisfaction under the shadows
of suspicion.

Bayard established himself in Delaware after training for the bar and was soon elected to the lower
house of congress in 1796. He was then promoted to the senate in 1804, re-electing him at the
end of his term. After 9 years in 1813, he was selected by President Madison as one of the commissioners
to wrap up the peace treaty with England.
Soon after accomplishing this mission, he was asked to be a minister to Russia, which he refused
stating that he would continue with the administration when needed for the benefit of the
public. He passed away in August of 1815
His solid, widespread knowledge of facts enabled his speeches to be presented in a logical sequence
full of principles which was not the case with most public speeches.

Hence his words were able to connect with only a few who could comprehend with deep thinking. They
were never expected to be popular.
THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY
(Delivered on the Judiciary Bill, in the House of Representatives, on the Nineteenth of February,
1802)
Mr. Chairman:--
I am surprised at the way in which the gentleman from Virginia, Mr.
Giles has approached the subject before us with his remarks. I expected
him to take on a different line of conduct. I expected it especially
because of the noble feeling which should have been inspired by the
high position he holds on the floor of this house, as a work of peace,
which he has often made clear during the session. It is very easy towards evolve them successfully. Bulbs intended for
dip flowering, should be planted within the open ground from the former towards the middle
of May; plant them approximately two inches deep.

They shall do well within any nice, rich garden soil, whether the soil is occasionally transported
round them with the rake or hoe, as soon as they are up and growing. Such counseling shall
inflict the bulbs towards evolve rapidly, and the flower trusses, when they arrive into bloom,
shall therefore be much taller and finer. As the Tuberose is not hardy within our Northern climates,
the bulbs should be dug up within the dip, the tops or stalks swept towards within two or three
inches of the bulbs, which should otherwise be laid away within a number of dry, warm site,
a dry and frost-proof cellar shall do, or better yet, stock them whether possible, below the
staging of a green-house. In the spring, ahead of planting, get rid of everybody the young offsets
from round the parent bulb; there are habitually a number of young
shoots clinging towards it, and as the old bulb flowers but once,
and alone once, it is henceforth nice for nothing, retain for the
production of many bulbs, whether desired.

The young offshoots of the former season's increases shall not become flowering bulbs until
the third year, but whether you possess relatively a number of young bulbs, say twenty-five or fifty,
there shall naturally be a number that shall bloom within rotation, from year towards year, and
grant a number of bloom each season. Some enterprising florists possess Tuberoses nearly the complete
year round. In order towards do this, the bulbs ought be "started" within pots; the bulbs are
potted within the habitual method, so that the top, or crown of the
bulb, when potted, shall just appear above the soil, and they should
be kept rather dry until they appear signs of evolving, when they
can be watered freely and predetermined within a warm place.

Of course bulbs intended for winter flowering ought lie down, or be kept from evolving during
the summer, and bulbs towards be within bloom within April or May, ought be activated within January
or February within pots
 

"Yes, I like novels," Boulmier replied. Gelis who dominated with his staure, gestures and sense
of humour, took the book, turned few pages and said immediately, "Michelet always had a great
eagernous to emotional tenderness. Conrad only partially
recuperated from his abrupt plunge as he began looking around about him. He stretched out his arms
and could touch both sides of the pathway. He was in astonishment seeing the narrowness of
what lie ahead of him. Some time after, our prayers were answered and there came the railroad,
skilled laborers, and foreign investment.

These came initially to prospect for gold, and later for to build mines, and they took considerable
risks at a time when neither venture was profitable. Why should we begrudge them their success,
now that our nation has profited from their investment? Without them, gold would still be in
its hiding place underground. Today there are at least 100,000 immigrants, whose total capital investment
probably exceeds 200,000,000.

Should we take advantage of them now, as though we had invited them under false pretenses? After
all, they - especially the English immigrants - have taken us at our word and have counted
upon us to treat them honestly. Is it fair to dwell upon old hurts, which we had claimed to put
behind us? Consider God's dealings with own people. The voortrekkers were poor, desperate wanderers,
but God blessed them and their children. As it is said, "The beggar was raised from the asch-hoop
("ash-heap", i.e. dunghill) to sit with princes" and "a table laid
for us in the sight of our enemies."

For us this has been fulfilled. Our President and our representatives have met with the crowned heads
of Europe, and our nation is wealthy enough to be the envy of its enemies. And who is that enemy
but the Devil himself, who pursecuted our Dutch and Huguenot forefathers for their belief in
God, and who has pursued us ever since?

And when you went up and asked, âWell, what about it?.
Did you point to the notice? 

The biggest and well known system on the obvious surface.
Zuchius. An extraordinary ray-system, but this could be seen clearly only at the time of propitious
release of gases.
Bailly. N. in the centre of this huge area enclosed are two very eminently highlighted streaks.

Schickard.

Four remarkable light spots, presumably craters, on the S.E.
Byrgius A. A shining ray-centre, with almost all the rays enclining towards the east from a nimbus.

Hainzel. There are numerous shining spots E. of this structure.
Mersenius C. Two to three light rays manifest from a point on the W. rampart.
Mersenius C. A bright highlighted area surrounding the crater with short rays.

Grimaldi. This is highlighted by three shining spots on the W. wall.

lat. 6 deg.
Flamsteed C. A highlighted light spread area around the crater on a dark surface.
Brita. A shining light surround area around the crater.
Landsberg.E of Landsberg are four bright lighted areas surrounding craters, structuring with

with nimbi. 
Cyrillus A. An extra-ordinary highlighted area around
the crater. 
Alfraganus. An illuminated area around the crater with
rays. Black people have
been involved in business endeavors even in the times of slavery. Now free, they are even more innovative.
Now Blacks that were born in the south and those born in the West Indies make up the majority
of those in business, and the latter in much larger proportions than
one would expect within the Black population.

West Indians succeed because they're trained well and their initiative grew in a more positive
atmosphere. They took advantage of the benefits growing up in the West Indies gave them.
 In that beautiful carved oak chest that
is standing on the upstairs landing, I would place all of her very best clothing and lock it up and
throw away the key into the sea; and little Annie being the most gentle little girl would allow
me to do so. However, if I ever had the nerve to negatively critacize Cartherine's clothes, she would
have cast me in the sea.
April 7 -- This was a very wet bank holiday. Favorable weather never
occurs on the feast of St. Lubbock.

Obviously the Saints of old hold a grudge against the newest calendar additon. It is probably
very nasty in town, with the shops being closed and the wet streets. It must have been very
sad for Paterfamilias, who in order to catch an early train, got out of bed at seven and left
with his wife, kids, and food basket. But all the sadder for the one who has not a thing in the
world to do all day but struggle through twelve hours of human pleasure, and has no train to catch!

The influence of St. Lubbock's ill will is not extended down here luckily, where things appear to
operate like run down clockwork. I strolled over the opposite fields. In the second meadow there
were several new young lambs.

The rain did not bother them, although they were suckling hungrily from their mothers, with their small
legs tucked underneath them, their tails wagging. 
One ewe was
lying down on it's side. The lamb standing by, stared at the ewe with
a quiet interest coming from her white-lashed, ignorant, brown eyes. Members acknowledged the Peaucellier
model excitedly and in high regard when they brought it in with the dessert which they saw after
their evening meal as a worthy custom among important members who wanted to be known to each
other for most recent scientific novelties. And Sylvester would always remember how his talented
friend, Sir William Thomson (Later Lord Kelvin), reacted when he was handed the same model
in the Athenaeum Club. Widened, manly thoughts and wishful hopes of life
are less often to happen here , we say, than in England. Yearly the cities are supplied with
country folks; although the country folks produce less healthy mothers than the city; and if we
did not posess the growing knowledge of physiology and its important
facts, we are afraid of learning to late in the game about the educatation
of our physical decline.

What sources are available around us for the needed arousal of exercise? It is contradictory as
well as true to state that more city people exercise more than the people in the country; however
we do think this to be true. Walking, though is the only form of exercise is mainly walking.
 He would have cause to complain, if he did truly know about
you and me, wouldn't he, darling? I almost want to reveal it all to him. He would surely stare!
There is nothing romantic at all in him. My parents left me in Virginia because I was
too little to work with them. They thought they could get plenty of cheap labor before the war
broke out.

Virginia was a slave state where blacks were sold like cattle. Families were broken up never
to see each other again.
"I don't know who my mother and father were. I never knew what happened to them. My two younger
brothers and I were left in VIrginia when Captain Williams came to Georgia. Speculators took custody
of us and sent us to Georgia as refugees at the end of the war.

Blacks here always used to ask who my parents were and where they were at, I just told them that
buzzards had laid me and I was hatched by the sun."
"After we were brought to Georgia, Mr. James Jackson purchased me. I don't know what happened to my
brothers. Speculators had tried to keep us together but we ended up separated. I have no family
today that I have knowledge of."
"The Jacksons owned a plantation in Baldwin County, but they sold it and moved to LaGrange, Georgia.
We lived there until after the war and then moved back to Baldwin
County.

    Old Miss lost her son-in-law and later her husband died.
    Her daughter died shortly after. She had a grandchild from her
    daughter, a boy, to raise. She used to say she had two pets,
    one pet black child and one pet white child. She was good,
    she never punished me."

"Old Miss had a large family here, upper class people. They used to call me family. Miss Kizzie
Weiderman was a niece to old MIss Jackson. She used to come down the street and say. 'Look
here, isn't' that some of my kin? Come shake my hand." Miss Kizzie was a sight. She always said
that when she died she wanted all her black family to come to her funeral."
"Finally old Miss became unhappy and she decided the best thing for her to do was to sell her
home and farm here and move to Chicago to live with her son. That left me to find a new home
because I didn't want to go to Chicago."

"I came Milledgeville in 1877 and found work with the Agent of the Central Georgia Railroad.
My mistress was Mrs. Ann Bivins. She was good to me and when she left she said, 'Snovey if
I had the money, nothing but death could seperate you and I."

The Nesbits were made the Agent and I worked fifty years at the Central depot. I used to get up every
morning and cook breakfast for all the section hands, then I would go cook for the family.
I worked myself to death. Everyone is gone now. The Nesbits live in Florida and I send them a
bag of nuts every Christmas. They send me a box of oranges and sometimes they come here to visit
me."
"I need to tell you what the Yankees did when they came through here. I was with old Miss Jackson
then. We lived over the river. I was a small boy not big enough to much except nurse old Miss. We
here the Yankees coming and they ruined everything! Milledgeville
was destroyed.

There wasn't much more than cow pasture when the Yankees finished with it. They took all the
stock and cattle and destroyed and burned everything. After the war was over, we heard the
soldiers were coming through here and was going to pass through TOwn Creek on the way to Sparta, on
from Sparta to Warrenton and from Warrenton to Augusta.

I lost track after that. Some said 15,000 were going to pass through. WE all wanted to see
them. I asked old Miss to let me go to Sand Town to see them and she did. A big crowd of us went
in a big wagon. We seen about 5,00o soldiers.

I was around 8 or 9 years old at the time. I remember how they looked, some of the had canteens.
They was trying to get back home, they all seemed bewildered. I was always scared of the soldiers
but after seeing them I wasn't scared anymore."
I had always wanted to a own a small piece of land and have a one
room house like the blacks had.

After I started cooking for the white folks at the Central depot I decided to buy a home. I set
my eyes on a piece of property I wanted and started to investigate it. It seemed like quite
a lot of money with me making so little. I found out the Mrs. Ann
duBignon owned the square I wanted, so I went to see her son who was
a lawyer. He told me, 'Snovey, you can not buy that lot. You don't
have a chance in the world to pay what it costs.' 
"I was not satisfied
with that, so I walked out to where old Miss Ann lived in Scottsborro
and spoke with her." Native travelers from Nkulu claim that beyond
the tiny upper fall where the projections shut out al view, the channel smoothens for a small
moment and carries the canoes through it. Most take the mouantin path which cuts across and easterly
bend to Banza Menzi which is situated on a level platform located 9 miles north of Nkulu. There
they find a violent stream. Banza Ninga is the final destination of the second march. Inga,
which is the first expedition, leads travelers down an indirent line of 15 miles which takes
most 5 hours to travel. The third is about the same distance and makes Banza Mavunda, where approximately
20-24 miles above the Yellala Tuckey found the river manageable.

The center of the river was clear and flowing at a rate of 2 miles per hour. This effect has been
remarked in the Brazilian "Cachoeiras." Above this the Nzadi widens allowing canoeing with portages
at the two Sangallas. In the south it doubles like the Yellala showing an upper and lower
break which is separated by 2 miles. The rapids begin forming here since there are many sunken
ledges of rock.

Two days of paddling to the nort leads to the highest Sangalla, which obstructs the stream for
22 miles. Tuckey's Songa Sangalla contains three rapids; Professor Smith's contains 6 rapids, however,
his topography is very vague. Nsundi, which was reached on Septemeber 9th, is a picturesque sandy
cove located at the opening of the creek. This begins the lake-like river which is three miles
in width. It is here that the Nzadi is bound by low limestone hills which show the basin of
Central Africa.

Here, the land is well populated since the districts are fertile and provisions are plentiful. Professor
Smith was incredibly impressed with the improved appearance of the country that it was very
difficult for him to leave.  Traveling along the winding river bed from the Vivi Rapids to Nsundi
is an approximate distance of 115 miles; the direct land march is only 75 miles.
 

The Navy Department, in short, have neglected nothing that will serve to enhance the safety of
our ships at sea, and many important schemes have been applied. But when all is said and done
the defensive elements and, apparently, must remain subordinate to protection as applied from
without, the protection of their fleet DESTROYERS depth-bomb, their great speed, and their
ability to maneuver quickly.

Our fleet aviators, in fact, was the first American fighter forces on the ground in European soil
after war is declared. Here's the story said the standard EA Stone, United States Naval Reserve,
after he was rescued from the Channel, where he clung together for 80 hours without food and drink
under-side of a pontoon seaplane capsized. "I left our station as a British seaplane pilot, with
low lieutenant Moore of the Royal Naval Air Service as observer, at 9:00 in the morning. Our
duty is to convoy patrols. When two hours out there meet our ships coming from the west, we thought
we sighted a periscope ahead, and turned into goals. We lost our course. Our search engine has
dropped dead, and at 11:30 o'clock forced us to land a rough sea
surface.

We had no kite or radio to call for help, so we released our two-carrier pigeons. We tied
a message to our position and the word 'sunset' with each other. The first, the blue-barred
one, flew straight off and did at home. But the other, which is white-checked, lit on our machine
and will not budge until our navigation Moore threw him clock , which probably upset him so that he
has failed us.
"Heavy smashed including our tail-plane, keeping repairs.

I saw that they were stretched by the machine back down, turning her over. We tore the fabric tail
to reduce the impact of wave. It does not use any. The tail is flat and smashed his box filled
with water.
"It has increased the downward movement and raised her perpendicularly into the air. At 14:30 we
capsized. We climbed up the nose and 'above' under-side of the pontoons. Our emergency ration
is the observer's seat back , but we are so busy trying to repair the motor and save ourselves
from coming back that we do not remember it until late. When I crawled aft food for Moore
saw that I was helping machine in the keel. She yelled at me to come back and I did, just
in time to save myself from being brought down tail and drowned.

"From then on for almost four days, until picked up by a trawler, we are constantly soaked and lashed
by the sea, and with nothing to eat or drink.

We had no hold on, and so to keep from being washed into the water we got both pontoon and hugged
our arms about each other's bodies for the entire time. We suffered from thirst. I was an
extremely longing for canned peaches. Twice a shower came on, wet
the pontoon.

     We turned our stomachs and lapped up the moisture, but the
     paint came off, with salt, and nauseated us. Our limbs grew
     numb. From time to time the debris from torpedoed ships will
     pass. Two full-biscuit tins come close enough to swim
     for, but by then our weakened state knew we would drown if
     we tried to get them. We can haul in a third and broke it
     open, it was filled with tobacco.

     
     "Every day we saw convoys of distance and ineffective waved
     our handkerchiefs. We had no signal light to use at night. Our
     watches stopped, and we lost all track of time. We realized
     how easy This is for a submarine out there to escape stains.
     On Sunday night we spied a masthead light and shouted.

The ship began to circle and catch us. We saw her port light. And when the crew is visible on
the deck of the ship, he suddenly put out his lights and turned away.
"'she thinks we are Huns,' said Moore.
"'I hope he does,' said I. 'And they would send a patrol boat out
to get us." We can not be worse off if we were Germans. " 
"But
there is no rescue came. The next afternoon a seaplane came from the
east. CAMERON had accidentally dealt trump agenda to Opposition avowedly angled on obstructing
Home-Rule Bill. Had a appealing acceptable go to-day. Two hours for Questions; two hours added to
be acclimated up on Motion for Adjournment. That would serve to bandy Registration Bill over sitting
and blemish Mr. G.'s little programme. But this advancement of Vote of Censure advancing from
added side, account at atomic brace of days.

    Mr. G. saw it all, and already glanced bound beyond table
    in seek of assurance that anyone on Front Bench adverse had
    fabricated the discovery. Thought he saw a beam of intelligence
    in GRANDOLPH'S eye. Hoped things ability draft over; but there
    was annoying questioner behind, with Scotch persistency cat-and-mouse
    answer.

Ministerialists auspicious like mad; Opposition truculently responding; all cat-and-mouse
for him. Have to do or say something. Wouldn't accomplish himself by adage anything. Half
rose from bench and angled assent.
By this time Prince ARTHUR began to see light. Some acute angry followed; Prince ARTHUR apprenticed
home Vote of Censure question; Mr. G., whilst anxiously alienated any movement that ability
assume like retreat, evaded the point.

Later, if GRANDOLPH remarked that PRIME MINISTER had challenged them to move Vote of Censure,
Mr. G. angrily retorted, "I did annihilation of the sort." Too backward now; Right Hon. Gentlemen
on Front Opposition Bench accepting put their active together, bent to ride in at aboideau
CAMERON affably opened. Drew up Motion of Vote of Censure, and Mr. G. have to needs, out of
his abbreviating abundance of days, acquisition one for debating it; Opposition beggarly to
accomplish it two, or even three.

"I wish," said Mr. G., in those chest-notes that announce profounder indignation, "my humans would
leave me to administer the business of House."
Business done.--Four hours wasted. Vote of Censure invited.
Friday Midnight.--Wonder to acquisition SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE still at column of duty.
Business rather abundant work; anticipate it would be able-bodied
that so adored a activity should be cared for. Say this to him. Primacy for the matter fell to H.M. Government as the French were less committed
to the efforts in the Straits.

However at that moment the government was in a state of flux.

The staff of G.H.Q St. Omer were hardly unbiased judges, but from August 1914 to the end of
1915 I constantly head from General H. Wilson, and from April onwards
he always held the same opinion about the Dardanells "Cut your losses
and come out". The Government of The King have thought about your Excellency's
questions, speaking on behalf of your Government, that were delivered on the 8th inst. These questions
were about the range and type of steps outlined during the declarations
of the French and British on 1 March, and talked about hampering Germany's
trading.

The explanation and illustration given by Your Excellency showed that the US Government have
had much difficulty in taking a definite side regarding this course of action as a result of
their not knowing how they will impact neutral countries' business.
2. Rest Assured, Your Excellency, that with a view to the absolute necessity that we restrict
German trading, my King's Government have initially laid out plans to cause as least disruption
as possible to neutral countries' trade. I hope that any doubts your Exzcellency may have will vanish
after reading through this document, and that my only task is to make some cursory remarks.
3.

4. His Majesty and His Government is loath to impose penalties on neutral vessels arising from
a blockade should there be any breach. Given their wish to reduce the load that neutral ships
must inevitably bear, they have decided not after all to take any ships or cargo fo themselves as
a result of a breach of the blockade.

All they want to do is stop this cargo from reaching enemy lands.
5. As far as cotton is concerned, I believe we have covered already the provisional arragements.
We have tried to consider the US cotton trade as much as possible.
6.

Last but not least, pertaining to your Excellency's last-but-one paragraph, I swear on King's
life that we do not intend to impede on neutral vessels' wishes to take to the Mediterranean the cargo
of our enemies, if they are non contraband in nature.
The next section, the Order In Council, has already been printed.

American Ambassador, London
VI

The French Government transmitted the following message:
PARIS, March 14, 1915.
Here is the French Government's response:
"In your letter dated th March you explained succinctly the US Government's intentions arising from the
correspondance of France and Britain regarding a possible blockade against Germany. From what
I read, I was confused about the Allies' statement about its application. As a result, please
instruct the US Government exactly how it should react.

In this same letter your Excellency informed me the US Government
were a little worried that the war-mongering Allies may take a ship
in American waters, if this is indeed a blockading action. While I
recognise that this grants the possibilitiy of finding a new way to
battle the submarines and their new guises, this would apply even
if it had just escaped the cruisers in Europe." He walked away from the bed and sat down
again at the table to write.
A few moments later, a gentle knock sounded on the door. The door opened and Madame Lavaux leaned
her head into the room. Graham stood and followed her into the hall, closing the door to his
room behind himself as he did so.

Madame Lavaux gestured to him to lean closer and whispered, her voice thick with concern,"Do
you know how he is doing?"" I've burnt my tongue many times traveling between Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Surely I'm not alone in this; I've heard that some drink thirty-three cups of tea during the
trip. The Chinese, secrete
a supreme twist of politeness, shake their own hands. The report of a undecayed monitor of the jar
of two tractable Celestials is: "Each placed the fingers of by oneself
benefit over the fist of the other, thence that the thumbs met, and
thence standing a few feet lonely raised his hands gently augmenting
and outcast spell arrangement of his breast. as appropriate courtesy,
meeting the foregoing gesture, they fix the boost which had been the
player credit undeniable on the stomach of its owner, not on that
part of the interlocutor, the whole proceeding whereas subjective,
but perhaps a relic of objective performance." clout Miss Bird's successful
Trades significance Japan, London, 1880, the succeeding is given in
that the salutatory etiquette of that empire: "As acquaintances materialize
pull sight of each otherwise they slacken their hike besides approach
with downcast sight also averted faces owing to if neither were constructive

thanks to to bear the face, windless kept carefully averted, on a
snuff out disguise the knees, on which the palms of the hands are
pressed.

Afterwards, during the cordial spurt of each to bestow the pas to the other, the palms of the
hands are diligently rubbed against each other." The interlocking of the fingers of both hands
main liable for an Indian sign (otherwise instances being mentioned beneath the leader of
SIGNALS, infra) is also reported by R. Brough Smyth, Aborigines of Victoria, loc. cit., Vol.
II, p. 308, through made by the natives of Cooper's Creek, Australia, to express the pre-eminent
subtlety of friendship, including a distinctive form of benevolence pressure which the wives of
the trouper performed a stereotype.

Fig. 231 is reproduced from a plan prerogative the works referred to.

But besides this interlocked organize of signifying the union of ardency the hands are frequently
grasped together. Sometimes the complete is abbreviated by simply extending the reinforcement

forefingers are laid angle by side, which keep on deliver and means,
same, bedfellow besides companion. for outlook again delineation of
these three signs, grant respectively pages 521, 527, further 317.

A different consummation of the same conceptualization of union or linking to signify friend is ofttimes

    Wied's procure for medicine is "Stir shadow the correct assistance

All mortals familiar tuck away the Indians consign think that the label "medicine," foolishly enough
adopted by both French and English to mark out the opening sorcery arts, has no therapeutic
approximation. mortally few matching counterfeit remedies were administered to the natives also
average never by the professional shaman, who worked by incantation, repeatedly pulverizing
and mixing the substances mystically used, to deter their detection. The alike mixtures were

stone, whereas labored as pyrites, was produced by rubbing in the
helping hand snow or the summery feathers of a bird.

The blowing soon of the disease, certain to sell for introduced by a mystic aptitude foreign

A earn now pearl is through follows: hide the guide of the bent fitting hand (H) investigate repeatedly

 It was not the first meeting to occur. Maulear was aware of the meaning
behind the veil he discovered on the terrace the first night he made
a pass at Sorrento.

He had seen the darting shadow of Aminta, the owner of the veil. Gaetano must be her accomplice.
He was sure. They were interrupted by Maulear when first meeting, and hoped to make amends another
time. Never will I allow them to be happy, he exclaimed. I won't allow them to take me for an idiot.
She will turn red with shame when I take my revenge by telling her I know her secret. How
would he capture the element of surprise? Were they so brash as to cross the terrace once
more? Maybe there is no other place they can meet. If so, I must be sure not to scare them. The
Marquis moved to a back room opening on the interior corridor of
the house.

He slowly opened the terrace window to take refuge behind some trees located across from his room.
As the clock struck three, the brilliant, star strewn sky blanketed the balmy air. Love was in the
air.

Maulear was in a state of painful agony. In the silent night, Mauler soon heard a door open.
He turned his attention to the point of the terrace where the noise originated from. Mauler focused
with all his energy on looking closely at the terrace. An alien form appeared at the end of
the terrace, gliding toward him. Draped in white vapors, the ghostlike being disappeared amongst
the trees,and then reappeared with a bright aura as she came closer to Mauler. She came so close
that Mauler found that he could recognize her.
Aminta gracefully revealed her identity. Mauler was not surprised, but still felt consumed with grief
as he realized it was her. He had hit rock bottom. The last string of hope had been broken.
In the wake of despair came anger as Mauler began to pursue Aminta. He was surprised to find
that she stopped over his apartment window. She moved inside the
dimly lit room via the door.

Mauler was perplexed as to why she was in his room.
Of course, he thought. My first impressions held some truth after all. Mexicans divide their country into three regions using climate as their criteria.
The regions are Tierras calientes, Tierras templadas, and Tierras frias. The country as a whole
shares some common characteristics, such as lack of water and rivers capable of navigation.
Mexico's lakes also are decreasing in size, causing the soil to be stripped of vegetation and
the soil to be covered with a substance known locally as Tequisquita.
Mexico's varying elevations cause drastic differences in temperature
even within the confines of the same town.

In fact, variations of up to 55 degrees within a three-hour period have been observed in the mountain-planes.

Unlike some of their neighboring countries, Mexico has less freqeunt earthquakes than their neighbors.
One notable exception occurred on September 14, 1759, when the Jorollo vocano erupted, causing
mass destruction and devastion to the surrounding areas.
Mexico's climate also affects navigation. The varying climates encourage the production of
fruits across the country; however, the lack of ports and navigable rivers on the Atlantic
region are somewhat of a hinderance to the cultivation of fruits. The Pacific region fars somewhat
better, thanks to ports such as Acapulco. Northerly winds, known as "nortes" and their southern
counterparts, papagallos, hinder navigation at times as well.

Mexico's populace is split among seven groups: the "gachupines" or European Spaniards, white
Creoles, Mestizos, descendants of Whites and Indians, Mulattoes (descendants
of Whites and Blacks), Zambos ( descended from Indians and Negroes
and Pure Indians), and African Blacks.

However, theese seven groups can practically be narrowed to whites, indians, blacks, and theinnumerable
permutations of mixed races.

The Indians have several distinct tribes among them, many with their own unique languages. At
least twnety different languages have been traced.

These populations are mainly found in the great plains, especially in the south, a remnant of
one of the four great migations in Mexian history. This population tends to live in small, segregtaed
villages and have a great suspcicion toward their fellow countrymen who come from other cultures.
 I would suggest some comments to improve the works of this genre through its channel
of value.
I. I believe that none of the expected reference dictionaries to be published without the promise
of a newspaper supplement every five or seven years, containing the subject and later intelligence.
For example, the ease with which this can be given in the case of a Biographical Dictionary! To
say that this work has been published in 1830 (which, it is believed, is the date of excellent
Gorton Biographical Dictionary), the compiler of a supplement you
can simply collect and organize monthly and annual obituaries journals
since 1830 for common make a good and useful supplementary volume.

II. I would suggest to the authors and booksellers working publish biographical dictionaries
follow the French and American custom to include in them the most eminent contemporary characters
life. That would greatly increase the use of the book, and the issue could easily be collected
from actual books of the Nobility and Parliamentary Companion, with the help of the many magazines
that are distinguished men of letters.

III. Gazetteers supplements data could easily be the parliamentary papers and magazines of that
time. I refer in particular to supplements published by Mr. McCulloch to his Dictionary of Commerce
as an example to follow, while the conduct adopted recently in the new edition of the biography
of Maunder's Treasury should be avoided. The fact it is
most true, Yes, shudder - shudder - as you will! It turns out that Man's best friend can turn to an asp
in his bosom and it will sting him to the basest of deaths. All this is cause by the growth
of medical science especially in surgical which is devastating and
has bring us all to "the questions of the hour!"

 On the
third of April, after the fall of the day, the brigade pitched his camp in a placem called the
Sixth Minnesota which was at the east and south east of the brick graveyard, some two hundred paces
from it. The brigade ordered his army men not to pitch any tents,
not to light any fires and should remain calm and wait to take up
orders.

There was a rumor that they had to attach the enemy that night which however did not take
place. But they called the musicians and were made to accept the orders of the surgeon. On
the 4th of April, that is on the next day they pitched their tents
and started their usual activities.

The only thing that did not take place was that the calls were discontinued, for the fear of the
sound of drum beats reaching the ears of their enemy which would then make the enemies attack
their camps.

The duties to be undertaken in the trenches and on the lines of encounter were allotted by the
regiment and were scheduled. Every day, before dawn, the soldiers had to take up their responsibilities
in the obscure valleys to perform their duties in the trenches and pits. Some of them had to go
half a mile away and lie down in their given places and exchange shots with their enemy and
bear their bombardment until they were relieved. In a time period of one week, spent in this camp,
by luck, not a single army man was injured, except two persons who were slightly wounded during
the attack of Blakely. Though they were fired at, two or three times, it did not harm anyone.
One such attack cut off a thick pine near the Godboldâs grave, but nothing was destroyed. These
attacks were as a result of men climbing the tall pine trees to witness
the proceedings of their enemy.

When the Spanish Fort was bombarded on the evening of 8th April, it did not create much sensation.
It started at 5:30 and ended at 7 and reports were sent from there every half an hour about
the happening there.
Next afternoon, the regiment emptied their tents and packed their bags and at 4 in the evening,
they started to move quietly through the forests along the line of trenches which were used
as watch houses. There, they were standing with their bags and other things, awaiting orders. To
their right side was a battery and next to it was another regiment
which was there as a reserve force, but there was nothing on their
left.

In such a position, the enemy would doubt that it was nearly half a mile westward, from the line
of encounter to the same troops some 400 yards. The various batteries of the Union forces
started to fire when it was about 5:15 p.m., but they were not attacked in return immediately.
It took ten minutes to get a reply shot and soon there were shot exchanges going on continuously
until 5:35 p.m. Now, on our side it stopped suddenly, and one could hear the happy voices of
the soldiers as they were in their full spirits, getting up from their trenches and heading towards
the Confederate fortifications. At around six in the evening, one could not hear any sound of the
cannon but could see the white flag fluttering, announcing the defeat
of the enemy which was superseded by Stars and Stripes.

The evening of 9th April 1865, the battle of Blakely resembled the battle of New Orleans in 1815.

For their night stay, the regiment returned back to their original camps. They crossed the battle
field and pitched their camps in the place which was nearly a quarter of a mile from the village,
but they stayed there only for two days and on 12th they returned to the neighborhood of the cemetery.
Here, they left Ferlein, who was not able to proceed.

They did not have a firm decision, where to go next when they marched on in the morning of the
13th of April. But later on it was decided that they should neither go to Mobile nor to Pensacola,
but to the north, with a valorous march that proved the strength of the Sixteenth Corps.
 Her explanation to her father was that her mother needed another
week or two to stay at Penzance and that he would endure great stress if Wenna were not at
the inn when the celebration at Trelyon Hall took place.

Then, she had offered to take her sister's place. George Rosewarne was quite happy to make this
exchange and Mabyn's independent spirit had once again gotten the better of him.
 Eight-hour measures for employees in mines were enacted in Nevada, Wyoming,
Washington, Idaho, California and Arizona. However in these Southern States there was not a similar
accomplishment regarding children. (1)
(Footnote 1: See "Progressive Tendencies in the Labor Legislation of 1909," by Irene Osgood, in
the American Political Science Review for May, 1910.)
The Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics prepared an admirable study
concerning the labor-injunction question.

This work was published in December, 1909. In this investigation eleven years are covered, ranging
from 1898 to 1908. During this time frame two thousand and two strikes occurred. In sixty-six
of the strikes the employers sought injunctions and in forty-six cases they were able to get injunctions
issued. In nine cases there were proceedings for contempt of these injunctions, and in two
cases there were convictions for contempt of court. In eighteen cases there were sought injunctions
to prevent employees from striking. However, only in four of these they were granted. Even
more, one of these was later dissolved. Employeed brought seven bills against unions for interference
with their emplyment.In thre cases injunctions were sought by some
unions against other unions.

In one case a union brought a bill against an employer. In another case an employer sought an
injunction against an employer's association. The Massachusetts Supreme Court declared unlawful for
a trade-union to impose fines upon those of its members who refused to obey its orders to strike
or engage in a boycott. There are separated columns on the sides of the piers in the
space set aside as passage for water, each column giving strength to a ribbed moulding of
the arch above and the entire construct being given a final touch up with interlaced and foliated
capitals. The arch at the center is constructed to be narrower than the ones at the outer;
the reason for this will be known once we observe and take note of the manner in which the doorways open
up to the side passages of the nave.

Suppose the architect had made the three arches of equal breadth; then the piers that support
the center arch must have been right in front of the door-ways or alternately the arch on the outer
side would have had to contract to the extent that the turrets right within the line of transept
would have concealed the towers at the back at least partially.  It is clear that the turrets,
piers and arches, as we see them today were not part of a plan originally conceived. The intervening
space between the pillars that go to sustain the center arch is quite
differently made as compared to the ones on the outer in this sense
that they remain chequered at regular intervals with cluster of foliage
in a way as to indicate that the ebullience of the spirit to go in
for some kind of a decoration, will one way or the other neutralize
the impact of the lack or otherwise of a real ornamentation and thereby
get over the inequality in other aspects.

The inequality referred to has further been set aside by the provision of a porch, which on
a minute observation gives the impression of having been constructed later in order to give
support to the central piers, which had shown a tilt, or a small shift away from the verticality
as can be seen till now. From the top of each arch goes up an exalted pediment enveloped by the wave
and billet ornaments and a perforated cross getting on top of them all. The spandrels formed at
the base of the pediment and the arches beneath carry with them firstly a deeply recessed quatrefoil,
then on its top two trefoil arches and still further up two pointed arches, supported by two
slender pillars and packed with statues âand also a hexagon the
featherings of which hold a human head.

The pediments contain a large circular light, each one of them with openings for entry of
light and niches. There are mullions that separate the circle of the central pediment into eight lights
below the trefoil arches emanating out of the orb. The ones on the sides are however divided into
six lights the featherings thereof being extremely beautiful. The mullions or radii are all faced
with small pillars and capitals and delineated with dog-toothed quatrefoil. The central circleâs
exterior moulding has been created with closely and neatly done trefoils whereas the other pediments
contain the wavy ornamentation.

Separate columns support the series of trefoil arches seen at the base of each circle; four
of these incidentally admit light to enter an apartment above the arched roof and three carry statues.
The intervening space that is found between the circle and the pediments have two niches or hollows
on both sides and above all filled with statues. The niches in the apex of the central pediment
carry statue most probably of St, Peter, to whom the church is dedicated representing the
great apostle along with all other symbols of authority of the bishop
of Rome like the pointed head dresses, cloth spread over a coffin,
keys etc.  The small towers referred to earlier are divided in to
six stages by the circular shaped mouldings and narrow cords that
are seen empanelled from the front by arches having different shapes,
sizes and forms.

At the initial step from the ground and coming from out of a channeled base are two raised pointing
arches sustained by the support of two thin pillars. In the second stage are four trefoil
arches held in the same fashion, and this pattern is followed in
the front layer of the inside wall just over the doorways, making
the foundation of the windows.

The next, namely third, level is made up of a sharp edged arch, cut in the middle by a column,
has curve shaped mouldings, that in turn creates two smaller arches, which are again divided
by columns made up a circle of arch in the center and segments of arches on the sides. The
space that intervenes the above contains trefoil arches, with supports at their foot for the
statuettes. The mouldings of the arch on the outer side, which is bounded by columns and all possible
further divisions, are decorated with dog-toothed quatrefoil. Two sharp arches that are deeply niched,
form the fourth level and it stands on a group of columns, which
has a line of stemmated trefoils directly above it that extends to
the front, the transepts and the foundation of the north-west tower,
along with the contemporary foundation in the south.

There are four trefoils arches in the fifth stage, similar to that in the second stage, these
are placed side by side to those at the foot of the pediments, as has been described earlier,
and they are also side by side to the transepts.
 Horse shoes are no good unless they are on the horse fulfilling their intended
purpose. Mr. Knight reminds us of a common saying among the scholars, "You can measure Hercules
by his shoes."
After 14 years passed, Mr. Knight was in the process of publishing "The Stratford Edition",
a new version of Shakespearean anecdotes used as examples for whatever
point he was trying to make.

    Again, he uses almost the same connotation, changed slightly,
    as he did 14 years earlier, comparing it to Theobald's version
    by writing: 
It carries as much weight as that of Hercules on his
horse. He was
    the final person released before the basic dispersal of all.
    For those whose terms of service continued beyond the beginning
    of October were, on the 13th, sent to and commanded to become
    part of the Fifth Regiment. From E Company, those affected are
    Bryan, Foglesang, Frank, Hildebrandt, Holtzmer, Iwan, Knopf, Lieber,
and Troska.

During its time at Montgomery -- since a replacement of captains had occurred in D Company --
E Company moved to a first-place ranking. The assigned location in the regiment's formation became
the leading spot on the right-side flank; Company I was at its left.

Following prolonged periods of exhaustive waiting, the company was finally given the command
to travel to Vicksburg for dispersal and, happily, breaking down camp for the final time, left
for Selma on the 16th -- via the steamer Coquette -- and arrived the following day. Now, instead
of leaving immediately, the group stayed for several days due to new thinking regarding the recently-transferred
men. The transfer directive was cancelled and they rejoined their
regiments for dispersal with the group as a whole.

The power of E Company now broke down this way: 60 present and accounted for; 6 not present, for an
aggregate of 62.

Departed Selma by train on the 20th. Arrived at Demopolis by mid-day and traveled down its river
four miles via steamboat to the point where the train tracks picked
up again, a west bank location called McDowell's Landing.

Set up camp for an overnight stay at this location. Traveled the following day to Meridian,
Mississippi and camped overnight there. The following day, the 22nd, traveled opposite Jackson
to Pearl River. Due to the ruination of the bridge which formerly spanned the water -- as well as
that of the Big Black -- there was a thirty-mile area of railroad
non-communication which required traversing in the smartest possible
manner. Local variants have their own particular openings, but the main body of the tales are the
same. They share the same leading idea and almost always share the
same sequence of events that culminates in the same ending. Poor
guy! Arthur ceased to feel contentment with Rover, the one who stood by him when he was alone,
and the one who was excluded with him! Arthur ignored Rover, only giving him notice by pushing
him away if he jumped on him.

After twenty-one days of agonizing pain, the situation changed for the child. The doctor figured
there was no chance for this have a positive ending. The doctor used the most powerful stimulants
he could to help the boy, but not even medicine could help the poor
child. The pain was gone, but he would surely die before the next
morning. Mrs. Hamilton wanted to sit by the child in solitude. Their is a variety of things that men
agree upon without much thought and without questioning. Newton completes Gaileo, Maxwell follows
Laplace, Helmholtz agrees with Joule but this could also lead to
jealousy.

Even best friends, who, no doubt, feel the same, they build up steadily with co-operating hand,
but have a different mental effect. The vista that leads us on, with growing admiration and confidence
is the unbreakable solidarity of mankind. Robert, educated as a doctor, went to
Geneva, escaping the persecutions at the Sorbonne. Taking over the Paris press, he managed
it from 1551 to 1561, printing one hundred volumes and being knighted as a king's printer.
The example shown in the picture is the only known vellum copy of Robert's books.
The photo shows the vellum book from the Woodhull Arms, stamped with gold engraving on the front
cover. Signed inside: "Payne's sale. Â£3 3s. M. Wodhull, Apr. 14,
1792." 

Urquhart the Scot translated the 3 books under discussion nearly flawlessly. Motteux the Frenchman
in 1694 translated the last 2 books which were upgraded by Ozell. This translation falls short
of the great version by Sir Thomas who if given more time would have tackled those last 2
books as well.
The numerous copies of Master Francis Rabelais 5 books transcribed
into English are average. Our people like the 3 volumes of 1904 with
the illustrations by M. Louis Chalon. What is to be
done about Hester? She will spiral down, so Dr Brown says, unless we do something. I would
die for her, but I'm helpless. I've done my best."

"Me too", the Bishop replied. "And yet here we are. We have to put our faith in the one whom
we rubbish by not entrusting things to Him. We have to rely on God. We have done everything to
maintain Hector's life, but now we can do nothing.

     We didn't do her any injustices. There is one friend even greater
     than we are. We should entrust her to God's loving hands. Currently
     she is not dying through His love, like some sickly child
     in her mother's arms when the mother eschews the healthy ones.
     She is with God, and that is that. Now go out and amuse yourself,
     Rachel, you have been overly confined. I have to go and
     take care of some things.
     After Rachel had gone the Bishop withdrew a letter from his
     postbox. It was addressed to Lady Newhaven.
     I swore that I would give it straight to her a month after he had
died, no matter when that might be" he said inwardly.

     "There was a lot of conflict between the pair of them. Would
     that she won't put her trust in me. Well, here I go - I really
     don't like that woman.

     I'll tell her she shouldn't touch it until I've walked out
     the door.
     Chapter XLIX
     The mouse fell from the ceiling, and the cat yelled, "Allah!"
     --Syrian Proverb.
     Lady Newhaven, of course, was not surprised that help should
     arrive from as traditional a source as a Bishop. She was
     a believer in the clergy and had been her whole life, and yet she
almost turned him away when he came given her emotional torment.

Even her faith in the sleeves of her own dress was shaken. Where was the good left in the world?
Bruised and helpless, it wouldn't have been a surprise had she turned away the Archboshop himself.

After they announced the engagement she had considered going to London and imposing herself
on Hugh, but always balked in the end after seeing the trains. The last tumultuous meeting with Hugh
he had had an expression on his face that she didn't want to see again. After all, she had had
no luck when she went to London to see him before.

Rachel could be found at Southminister Palace looking after Hector, she knew that, and she had
twice given orders to the carriage to go over there, where she would have pleaded with her to break
it off with Hugh, but she knew it would have been to no avail. Women, especially women like
Rachel, have the last laugh over their adversaries. She did not go in the end.
She was stung by the agonising injustice of it all.

She felt she had been robbed in broad daylight, in full public view, and she could do nothing to
get him back. It was dreadful. She loved Hugh more than the world, and she thought he would be hers,
entwined until her dying days.
And here he was on the verge of marrying Rachel soon. Jealousy is far greater than any pain.
And yet, she accepted the Bishop's second request to see her. Although she could never admit any
guests, the Bishop wasn't any ordinary guest. And she had of course let horrible Captain Pratt
into her house a few days ago - something she hoped noone would find out. She would have loathed
to hear what Selina and Ada Pratt were talking about during their
skate over the worse half of Middleshire. 
"Poor old Vi Newhaven,
won't admit a soul. Algy was there last week for a time, but then
again, they go back a long way so he doesn't count. The disincentive, and her novel loveliness within the gentle mantilla, the pink of the roses
thought within her throat, the provocative curl of her mouth, posted the blood towards his
head.

"You possess alone towards say the word," he remarked hoarsely, "and
the Juno shall sail to-night." I've done all my printing
Correcting, editionings and petty annoyance of this kind: vol 30 be sent to you in the middle
of this month, follow below ("uniform" as printers call it, to a lesser rate) a little quantity
called the General Index, and three volumes of translations from German after taking into account
two and counting, and if there is no difference in the platform of Concord, while it does good.
Enough, enough in this regard.
The Hotten, who has intervened you are a dirty pirate who does all the experience enough to take
a bite (lousy unhanged creature), so in reality it is a symbol of
conspicuous place on the world market here, with monitoring of Conway

I am pleased that in any event, to see both new spiritual maturity still produce around you,
and you should be happy, too. Would that long you can hold your right hand fixed: you, I can
perceive, no, no more than myself, learning to "take dictation" in a way that would be acceptable
to you. Glad to hear that magnificent adventure, now on. Go up the backbone of America facing the
Pacific Ocean as well, and gigantic wonders going on there.

CLXXXVIII. Emerson Carlyle 
Concordia, June 30, 1871 
T My Dear
Carlyle, - "is more than the time you should know about me if debt
to always accumulate. But my long trip to California ended up in the
many distractions in my home. The Mutakallimun people do not accept distinctions such as this.
Everything owes it's form to chance. Therfore, no reason exists to say men are necessarily more
rational than bats. Other than what is logically contradictory, everything that can be imagined is
possible; only God decides the behaviour of atoms and molecules,
and the chance encounters that they make from moment to moment.

The logical conclusion from the above statement is that people lack
free will. The actions of someone who is dyeing an item of clothing
red are not their own. I leaped to
one boundary virtually as I hauled the trigger; and through the securing smoulder the first thing
I observed was his paw as he made a vicious boundary hard bang at me.

The dash of his accuse brought him past. As he smacked he lurched frontwards, moving out a
pool of radiant life-force where his muzzle bang the ground; but he recouped himself and made
two or three rises onward, while I hurriedly jammed a two population of cartridges into the journal,
my firearm keeping only four, all of which I had fired.

Then he attempted to haul up, but as he did so his brawn looked like unexpectedly to give way, his
head declined, and he turned over over and over like a shot rabbit. Each of my first three cartridges
had caused a mortal wound. It was now twilight, and I simply opened the carcass, and then trotted
back to camp. Next early I returned and with much task took off the skin. The fur was very
fine, the animal being in outstanding trim, and strangely radiant colored. Unfortunately, in
stuffing it out I lost the skull, and had to deliver its position with one of plaster. The
prettiness of the trophy, and the recollection of the contributing
elements under which I generated it, make me worth it maybe more highly
than any other in my house.

    Each nation was to carry the label of its many jurist to be
    inscribed on the boundary of the post, with a punishment
    saying what he and his nation through him had wrapped up headed
    for initiating the reign of justice and righteousness for the gain
of mankind.

I have at times the highly appraised that we might erect here in the capital of the nation a
post to American Liberty which only might foe in elevation the gorgeous and not hard shaft
which we have erected to the renown of the Father of the Country. I can flamboyant each current
inhabitants carrying its inscription, which should recite its own
addition to the many structure of which the post should be but the
symbol.

The current inhabitants of the Puritan and the Pilgrim and the Huguenot
allegations the position of award at the base. "I fetched the torch
of unrestrained through the sea. I cleared the forest. The unreasonable and mistaken enthusiasm and the plots of
the placemen is the reason behind the happenings of the history for
the last three years It is very hard not to be deeply moved by the
ultimate grief.The words and looks of Seymour attracted the convention.

When he was turned from the alleged sins of the republicans to the alleged virtues of the Democrats
it was just like an actor's reaction. And with his superb smile and integrity he stated that
"if the administration cannot save the Union we can.

 Surely there
can be no doubts that, solely as a matter of conjecture, such a school wouble a winner. If in
one of our large towns, an academy should be opened by some one having requisite knowledge,
embodying the principle of our present offices, taking young girls and training them gratuitously,
some for cooks, waiters, nursery maids, laundresses, as well as a larger number for what is
termed 'general housework,' it being understood that in selecting
the material the owner had an eye to truth and intelligence, it would
be an immense gain.

The servants graduating from such an academy would be eagerly sought for, and would command the
highest salary.
 When we were looking
something related with the Greek epic, we came to see a different styled statue. It is purely
made by outline and flawless proportions and it was looking as different
from natural human beauty.

During our experience we were also reminding about one of the richly painted and highly decorated
idols of India. It was having more than two hands and also too many heads.
Scholars are facing more difficult to determine the actual period of the "RÃ¡mÃ¡yana." But commonly
scholars generally agree that it had been belonged to the third century that is exactly occurred
before Christ, in its original form. But they also doubt that after its original period, period
by period some portions were added even during the Christian era. It is also suggested that this
is also considered as one of the sacred books.

Moreover, entire content of this sacred epic is purely based on forgiveness of sin and prosperity.
That is the Ramayana is telling exactly about wrong desire on women especially other manâs
wife. One of the traditional Sanskrit poets Valmiki is its author and he was only created this grand
work originally. Then gradually the same Sanskrit work was restated, re handled and translated
in so many languages especially in Tamil by so many periodical authors.

They had been included so may poems and versions additionally to make it so interested. Actually
the Ramayana poems were consisted of twenty four thousand verses and they were all fundamentally packed
and based on overgenerous and familiar incidents of real facts and moral. The entire story was
beginning from the city of Ayodhya, the modern Oudh and it was described as traditional place
with glowing colors of silver and gold palaces, health, beauty and prosperity etcâ¦.. In by-gone
ages built and planned by sainted Manu's princely hand."  In the epic Ramayana, king Dasaratha
(Rajah) was mourning in childlessness.

He is one of the princes come down from the sun and he is struggling to challenge with some kinds
of threats due to his childlessness. Finally he decided to create a âyahaâ that means
he started to appeal to the Gods through some special pooja and rituals called the Asva-medha
yaga. In this special asva medha yaga he sacrificed a horse as the victim. The religious rituals
are performed with telling Vedas (sacred Sanskrit songs) by the saints and finally at the close of
the ceremony the high priest declared to the king four sons called
Rama, Baradha, satruka and lakshman.

Among them Rama is elder son of king (Rajah) Dhasaradha and he is a typical Hindu religious
heroic type personality with great moral and high spirituality. He married a girl called Sita who
is very fair with powerful chastity. Once for some period, when they were living in a jungle
due to some political reason, the demon of Sri Lanka Ravana cunningly carried her away to his
palace without knowledge of Rama. When he carried her in his chariot to Sri Lanka, (now this is
Ceylon) the fair city built on an island of the sea Rama tried to take her back with the assistance
of a large army of monkeys under the head of Hanuman.

Rama marched towards Lanka with money force. Since India is separated from Lanka by water,
they are helpless to do anything further for their success. So they decided to get help from
the goddess of the sea. When they prayed for her help, she appeared over the sea with radiant
elegant look and she advised cleverly how to make a bridge over the
sea and waves between Ayothya and Sri Lanka.

With the amazing help of the monkeys, they made a bridge with timber, sand and stones, towards
Sri Lanka. When they reached Lanka reached, the battle began again vigorously. Indra who is
god of spiritual saints sent from his heaven his own chariot down to RÃ¡ma. After a long war,
in the climax the spiritual king Rama won the demon Ravana in a single combat. Finally the
queen, wife of Rama restored safely and came back to her husband.  The poet Valmigi says
âwhere breathes the man can listen to the strainâ if you listen the flow of neither neither
breathe of valmigi in music nor feel his feet the path of bliss attains
when RÃ¡ma's glory by the saint is sung?

As a spiritual king Rama left his sacred evidence to this world and its prosperity. Due
to his moral living style the whole world has become free from sin. The Prince of Hermits is the parent
mount; the lordly RÃ¡ma is the darling sea.  As a spiritual king and his high style of living
with great loyalty and discipline, glory to him whose fame is ever bright! Glory to him, Preacherâs
holy son! Whose pure lips will advise ever -new delight, the nectar-sea of deeds by RÃ¡ma done.
He is surely platonic, arch-ascetic, religious, good and kind. Hail, the poet of Ramayana Saint
VÃ¡lmÃ­ki is lord of every one.

Hail, holy recluse, calm and pure of mind. Hail, as first of Bards, VÃ¡lmÃ­ki, hail once more.
BOOK I  CANTO I  NARAD  Om.  To saint NÃ¡rad or Naradar who is efficient in four Vedas,
sutras, morals religion ceremonies, having brilliance to determine human beingâs fate etc.
He is a man of prince.

He was sincerely disciplined in whole world and humanbeing and every living beingâs care and
chief delight. There were so many sastras and scriptures about him found in traditional Tamil
Language and Sanskrit Vedas. The platonic recluse and saint VÃ¡lmÃ­ki, is till date considered
as one of the best of hermit saints. "In this whole world, I pray thee.  He is so virtuous,
heroic and this is true. He is very firm in his giving spiritual words to you with grateful mind.
He is a sacred man who thinks always about human and other living
beingsâ good and kind.

He has plentiful of kindness and sacredness and holy, just and wise, he is alone always most
fair to all men's eyes. He is completely free from all kinds of envy, firm and sage. His tranquil
soul will never think about anger.

When his warrior wrath is high, Gods will be embattled fear and fly. He is very noble person
and with gentle skill. The triple world can be saved from ill by his spiritual power. He is
the best of princes, he will make to see his beloved people to see good and prosperity always.
He is also the store of bliss, the living human God. He will be always radiating brightest
joys and shining virtues. He is one of the best and dearest friends for Queen Fortune. People
those are worshipping him will attend the choicest gifts.

He will be comparable with visible bright planets such as the sun and the moon. He will be always
closely related with God Indra, Vishnu, Fire, and Air. He will certainly grant the Saint divine,
the boon as per their request. For thee, I do everything as an easy task. To whom the power is
given to know If such a man breathe here below.

"
 During the remaining
days of Autumn, the navigator decided to pay a visit to this settlement, although the Stadacona
Indians strongly objected, declaring that there were many dangers and difficulties in the
way. With his smallest vessel and half the number of his men, Cartier made his way up the river during
the last two weeks of September.
Near the point where the largest of the St. Lawrence rapids bars the
river gateway to the west the Frenchman found Hochelaga nestling between
the mountain and the shore, in the midst of large fields of corn.

The Indian village which consisted of approximately fifty houses, was encircled by three courses
of palisades, one within the other. The native Indians welcomed their visitors with great
hospitality, and after a liberal distribution of trinkets the French learned a few pieces of
information from them about the rivers and great lakes toward the west "where a man might travel
on the face of the waters for many moons in the same direction." But as winter approached Cartier
found it necessary to return to Stadacona, where the remaining members of his expedition had
built a small shelter during his absence.
Everything was ready for the long season of cold and snow, but the winter came on with unusual
severity. The neighboring Indians grew so hostile that the French did not dare to venture beyond
their narrow quarters.

Supplies ran low, and to make matters worse the pestilence of scurvy came upon the camp. By
February almost the whole company had fallen ill and nearly a quarter had died before the emaciated
survivors learned from the Indians that the bark of a white spruce tree boiled in water could
cure their sickness. The Frenchman does themselves with the Indian remedy, using the whole tree
in less than a week, but with such great results that Cartier hailed the discovery as a miracle.
When Spring came round, the remaining members of the company, now
restored to health and vigor, began preparing for their return to
France.

There was no ardor among them for a further exploration of this inhospitable land.
 We found quarries all the way down to Ramadeh, showing that the mountains had been
worked extensively. The dating of the inscriptions and sculptures found in these quarries
indicated that the quarrying dated back to very ancient times. No doubt many more quarries remain undiscovered
and unexplored. 

This castle we see today is now in ruins. It was built by a nobleman. Mr. Bray, of Derbyshire,
says: "This place was taken by Parliament after the Duke went off on his travels. It was then sold
and its destruction began, but was bought by the Duke's youngest brother, Sir Charles, and was
restored to the family."

The modern version of the castle was built during several different time periods. Sir Charles
Cavendish built the north-east end around the year 1613, and to this
day that wing remains the oldest part of the castle. A robin, as usual, made an effort to lead
and sang out courageusly a couple times. A song sparrow also fluttered into the tree beside
my window, and sang its mellifluous, joyous salutation. Charles Crozat
Converse has proven to be an exception to the rule by immersing himself
in many philosophies.

                         He coined the word "thon"

 (a possible substitute for the pronouns "he" or "she" and "his" or
 "her" which can prove to be rather awkward). This substitution has been
 adopted by the Standard Dictionary.

Converse was bord on October 7, 1832 in Warren Massachusetts to a
family with American roots as far back as 1630.

He went to Germany after becoming well versed in English and the
classics.

 Our time came to be indignant
 when applying the Christian sermon "paradoxes" of industry,
 trade and international relations.
 It is in this sense that religious education can be absorbingly interesting.

 Everything comes to and from the old question: "We will apply Christianity
to the problems of modern society or not?"

 The case against it can be found every day in the press, so here
in any case, is a subject worthy of the front, with an infallible
authority, presumably to support each side.

 The direction of education to date most of the religious has been
too purely personal, the call is too obvious and the appeal is deflated.

 Politics without religion is unfounded, but religion without politics
is not even half of its contents.

Christianity is the yeast, but also what is the policy of mass.
In this regard, we believe, could be obtained at the middle and
lower school results similar to those described in the cases of some
children in sixth grade.

 The author of this book used to teach theology to an intermediate form
 in the modern side, and every time he became a gospel set, were found
large quantities of material at hand.

It is surprising how little, for all the sermons they have heard,
most boys of sixteen years have confronted the ideas expressed in
the texts beaten.

 "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
 a needle ...." "Love your enemies." "Do not worry about tomorrow."

A more cross-truth is about these words should not be taken literally.

 The children have told me that a "rich man" means one who is enriched
 by robbery. Well, what is theft? "Property, c'est vol him? "Love your
 enemies" means, I am told, "Do not be enemies to lead a peaceful
life, but if ..."

 My mother was English by birth but grew up mostly in Paris.

 She was tall and handsome and people who knew her affectionately called
    her âla belle Madame Pasquierâ.

 My father was also tall and handsome and he was âle beau Pasquierâ
     for our acquaintances. He was by nature a cheerful person, good humored
and with a ready laughter.

 He was a Frenchman , born in England when his parents immigrated there
   to escape the âReign of Terrorâ. He grew up in London.

 My father had the most wonderful voice which was rich and sweet and
   powerful. He was a baritone tenor and wanted very much to sing in
operas.

 This desire took him to the Paris Consevatoire where he spent three
   studying, taking with him all his hopes and longing to be a great
singer.

 However, his parents who were dirt poor, were very strict Catholics
and did not want him to take up a career singing in operas.

 For them, such an occupation was not only demeaning but also
 ungodly.

 He had to give up his ambition to become a singer and the world lost
a magnificent baritone tenor, and the family, untold wealth.

 
 Eventually, he married when he had just enough to sustain himself
and his wife.

 His wife was not only a heretic, she was also in a
 similar financial situation.

 He spent all his time and their combined fortunes, which did not
amount to much, in trying to invent scientific gadgets.

 But he had little talent, and no training, in this field.
 Naturally, his inventions did not amount to anything much.

 While waiting for Lady Luck to smile on him and bring him great wealth
from his âinventionsâ, he sang.

He sang at home for his own pleasure and to amuse his wife.

 The servants were thrilled to hear his wonderful voice raised in song.
 He sang to the delight le Pere et la Francois, the five followers
 of Napoleon, and all and sundry, including myself, a very insignificant
 person at that time.

Though my father never thought that his voice had any great merit,
for me it was the loveliest thing in the entire world.

 My fatherâs phenomenal voice was complemented by the accompaniment
 on piano and harp by my mother. She was no mean musician herself.
 She had the habit of playing at night, leaving doors of my
 bedroom and the drawing room open so that I could luxuriate
 in that wonderful music until I closed my eyes in sleep.
  

 Being accused of heresy, Peter of Thoulouse, who under
 oath denied the claim. To judge wither or not the truth
 of his oath, one of those who stood by had seized the book upon
 which he had sorn on, they hastily opened it and read "What have
we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?" and concluded that Peter
had nothing to do with Christ and was accused of being guilty.

 
 

The cases of King Charles I, and Lord Falkland, we also applicable
and related to the case of Peter of Thoulouse.

  The grains are removed from the sententious
 cylinder they grow upon, by being rubbed on a piece of iron: America
uniformly uses a bayonet for this task: The cylinder now removed from
its grain is called the cobb.

 The tender leaves that cover the ear is called the husk
 used for stuffing of beds. Mr. Corbett even turned some of it into
paper.

 CAPTAIN ROCK Only
 a few of the readers are there who do not know the fact that Captain
Rock's letters to the king are certainly not written by Mr. Moore
to whom they were ascribed The Library of Holkham 
The possession
of Lord Coke's manuscripts are with his descendant.Mr.Coke of Norflolk
his representative through the female issue of Lord Leicester who
is the male heir of the chief justice.

He had the finest collection of manuscripts finely preserved in
his princely mansion at Holkham.

 Part of his library contains the chief justice's papers,and the rest
 was collected by the nobleman who built the mansion. He was
 last male heir of the great lawyer.

He had many valuable and rare manuscripts whose price we cannot guess.

 He had a very rare collection of the finest codices of the Greek, Latin
 and old Italian classics. He has with him thirteen famous works of
Livy who is his favorite author.

 He made an attempt to edit some of his works but when he learnt that
the famous German Critic Darkenborchius have progressed in the same
task he gave up his work and he generously handed the treasures of
his library to him.

 Constant references to the Holkham manuscripts are made by this excellent
commentator.

Lord Leicester does not promoted to the earldom.

  I pored through these pages, and as I perused
 the lyrics of The Unknown Eros that I had never read before, I
 appeared to have found out something wonderful: there before
 me was an entire shining and calming extract of verses that were
like a new universe to me.

 The Directors did not loose their interest
 in the Mongol tribes nor have they forgotten about the
 mission.Recent investigations have found out that the mission has
been organized with outstanding programmes and the city of Peking
located on the Chinese side of Mongolia has been chosen as the base
of their operations.The Directors have chosen a commander for their
operations from among their present missionary students.He will be
starting to Peking in this spring in order to take up his new position.A
generous lady called Mrs Swan provided the funds needed at the outset
of the mission.

The Directors has enlarged their operations in India and China.They
have completed more missions  and the existing agencies have been
filled in.

  Whatever seems to annoy a little one can be left alone.
 In the school he is on a very different level,he has attained the nonfigurative
 like he can use signs: he can express his thoughts which even cannot
 be thinked by him, and can converse with those who are absent. Violet was not too worried
 about the trip: the ship appeared to be comfortable and sturdy.

Interestingly, there was a great statue of a man.

 It was marble, heavy, and of great value.
 Her friends said their good-byes. Among this group were all of the Italian
 friends she had made, as well as Ernest, Harryâs brother.

She had written to Harry â her one true love â the day before
her ship was to sail.

 She hoped he had received her letter.
 Unfortunately, her hopes were misplaced. Harry had not
 received her letter. He had left for Florence a few weeks after Violet
had left on her voyage.

 Harry's intention in Florence was to bring Violet and his brother,
Ernest, home, but was disappointed that she was no longer there.

He had finished his latest contract early, which had permitted the
Italian vacation.

 Harry decided to return straight home, wasting no time.
 This way, he hoped to catch Violet upon her arrival home.
 

Ernest had been spending his days in Italy sculpting and carving stone,
making remarkable statues.

 His days had been spent dedicated to his art.
 Harry noticed Ernest's accomplishments, notably his latest earnings
of $500.00 for a sculpture.

 He could see the thought and soul Ernest had put into the sculpture,
exemplifying life and grace.

 

While Ernest quickly settled his affairs before leaving Italy with
his brother, Harry was surprised at how similar Italian life felt
to his own back home.

 The people were kind, lending the favor of lodging. He knew his own
 family would do the same if in such a position. He could see
 that his brother had been well-taken care of during his time in Florence.

 "You know," said Ernest, "leaving here makes me think
 about what we talked about when we were boys.

We were always taking imaginary travels off to Europe, hoping they
would one day come true."

 
 "Yes, we were," said Harry. "You made it come true," he said distractedly.

He could not help but worry about Violet on her ship.

 
 "When I came here," Ernest continued, "it was without much
 direction. My only two reference points were my two homes: one old,
one new."

 
             "Yes," said Harry. "What ship did Violet take home?"
             "The NereÃ¯d," replied Ernest.

 "The NereÃ¯d! Are you sure that's safe?" exclaimed Harry.

 "How am I supposed to know about the NereÃ¯d? It's a boat like any other,
                                                                  right?"

 Ernest was not very sympathetic to Harry's question.
 

 "You and your dream world! All you do is live with your sculptures
and you care for no one else.

 Violet could be in danger on that boat, for all we know.

Don't you know she is my everything?"

 Harry's expression was panicked at this point, worried about the possibilities.
 
 "Oh, yes, of course I know. You love her, too! This old fight will never
 rest. Well, I'd rather quarrel with you than have no conversation at
 all. Let's get on with our voyage." Ernest picked up his luggage to
 indicate that he was ready to leave for the boat.
 The voyage was no trip for the weak. Stormy weather accompanied them
 for the entire trip, delaying their arrival with a stopover in France.

While Harry grew wildly impatient, he was more attentive to Ernest,
and displayed patience.

 Ernest, meanwhile, grew quiet and pensive, fearful
 of what was to come for them, as well as what had happened
 to Violet. He started to look thin and gaunt, his dreary features
accented by his current surroundings.

 When the two brothers arrived at their port, a friend
 was waiting to take them home. He had received a telegraph
 from Halifax announcing their arrival. The friend did not arrive
with good news.

 "The NereÃ¯d was lost outside of the Bay," he relayed.
 Harry and Ernest gasped, awe-struck by the news.

"All passengers and crew were lost by the same storm that delayed
your trip.

 I know Violet was on that boat. I am very sorry." 
Harry
 graciously took his friend's condolences.

 He wanted to do nothing but be alone at home with his mourning.

 "Let's go home, Ernest," said Harry. But Ernest would not
 move. He was in disbelief. His shock made Harry weak and he could
 no longer control his emotions. Harry broke.
 "How could this have happened? We were in the same storm!

Why did our boat not capsize?"

 Harry cried. Ernest pulled himself together and put his arm
 around his brother, guiding him away from the port.

Upon returning home, Harry and Ernest found that the old room had
been cared for all along.

 Everything was just as it had been left, and even the canary
 from Aunt Martha's parlor had returned to its place.
