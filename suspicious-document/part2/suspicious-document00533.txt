He was profuse in his rewards; on the 12th, 21st, 127th of the line, and the 17th light, he
conferred eighty-seven decorations and promotions; these were Gudin's regiments. The 127th
had, before this, marched without an eagle; for at that time it was necessary for a regiment
to earn its colours in a field of battle, to prove, that in the sequel it would know how to
preserve them there.

The emperor delivered the eagle to it with his own hands; he also satisfied Ney's corps. His
favours were as great in themselves as they were in their form. The value of the gift was enhanced
by the manner in which he bestowed it. He was successively surrounded by each regiment as by
a family. There he appealed in a loud voice to the officers, subalterns, and privates, inquiring
who were the bravest of all those brave men, or the most successful, and recompensing them
on the spot. The officers named, the soldiers confirmed, the emperor approved: thus, as he
himself observed, the elections were made instantaneously, in a circle, in his presence, and
confirmed with acclamations by the troops.

These paternal manners, which made the private soldier the military comrade of the ruler of
Europe; these forms, which revived the still-regretted usages of the republic, delighted the
troops. He was a monarch, but the monarch of the Revolution; and they could not but love a
fortunate sovereign who led them on to fortune; in him there was every thing to excite, and
nothing to reproach them.

Never did field of victory exhibit a spectacle more capable of exalting; the presentation of
that eagle so richly merited, the pomp of these promotions, the shouts of joy, the glory of
those warriors, recompensed on the very spot where it had just been acquired; their valour
proclaimed by a voice, every accent of which rung throughout attentive Europe; by that great
captain whose bulletins would carry their names over the whole world, and more especially among
their countrymen, and into the bosoms of their families, which they would at once cheer and
make proud: how many favours at once! they were absolutely intoxicated with them: he himself
seemed at first to allow himself to share their transports.

But when he was out of sight of his troops, the attitude of Ney and Murat, and the words of
Poniatowski, who was as frank and judicious in council as he was intrepid in the field, tranquillized
him; and when the close heat of the day began to overpower him, and he learned from the reports
that his men had proceeded eight leagues without overtaking the enemy, the spell was entirely
dissolved. On his return to Smolensk, the jolting of his carriage over the relics of the fight,
the stoppages caused on the road by the long file of the wounded who were crawling or being
carried back, and in Smolensk itself by the tumbrels of amputated limbs about to be thrown
away at a distance; in a word, all that is horrible and odious out of fields of battle, completely
disarmed him. Smolensk was but one vast hospital, and the loud groans which issued from it
drowned the shout of glory which had just been raised on the fields of Valoutina.

The reports of the surgeons were frightful: in that country a spirit distilled from grain is
used instead of wine and brandy made from grapes. Narcotic plants are mixed with it. Our young
soldiers, exhausted with hunger and fatigue, conceived that this liquor would cheer them; but
its perfidious heat caused them to throw out at once all the fire that was yet left in them,
after which they sank exhausted, and became the victims of disease.

Others, less sober, or more debilitated, were seized with dizziness, stupefaction, and torpor;
they squatted into the ditches and on the roads. Their half-open, watery, and lack-lustre eyes
seemed to watch, with insensibility, death gradually seizing their whole frame; they expired
sullenly and without a groan.

At Wilna, it had not been possible to establish hospitals for more than six thousand sick:
convents, churches, synagogues, and barns, served to receive the suffering multitude. In these
dismal places, which were sometimes unhealthy, but still too few, and too crowded, the sick
were frequently without food, without beds, without covering, and without even straw and medicines.
The surgeons were inadequate to the duty, so that every thing, even to the very hospitals,
contributed to create disease, and nothing to cure.

At Witepsk, 400 wounded Russians were left on the field of battle: 300 more were abandoned
in the town by their army; and as the inhabitants had been taken away, these unfortunate wretches
remained three days before they were discovered, without assistance, huddled together pell-mell,
dead and dying, amidst the most horrible filth and infection: they were at length collected
together and mixed with our own wounded, who, like those of the Russians, amounted to 700.
Our surgeons tore up their very shirts, and those of these poor creatures, to dress them; for
there already began to be a scarcity of linen.

When at length the wounds of these unfortunate men were healed, and they required nothing but
wholesome food to complete their cure, they perished for want of sustenance: few either of
the French or Russians escaped. Those who were prevented from going in quest of food by the
loss of a limb, or by debility, were the first to sink. These disasters occurred wherever the
emperor was not in person; his presence bringing, and his departure carrying, every thing along
with it; and his orders, in fact, not being scrupulously obeyed but within the circle of his
own observation.

At Smolensk, there was no want of hospitals; fifteen spacious brick buildings were rescued
from the flames: there were even found some wine, brandy, and a few medical stores; and our
reserve waggons for the wounded at length rejoined us: but every thing ran short. The surgeons
were at work night and day, but the very second night, all the materials for dressing the wounded
were exhausted: there was no more linen, and they were forced to use paper, found in the archives,
in its stead. Parchment served for splinters, and coarse cloth for compresses; and they had
no other substitute for lint than tow and birch down (coton du bouleau).

Our surgeons were overwhelmed with dismay: for three days an hospital of a hundred wounded
had been forgotten; an accident led to its discovery: Rapp penetrated into that abode of despair.
I will spare my reader the horror of a description. Wherefore communicate those terrible impressions
which harrow up the soul? Rapp did not spare them to Napoleon, who instantly caused his own
wine, and a sum of money, to be distributed among such of those unfortunate men as a tenacious
life still animated, or whom a disgusting food had supported.

But to the vehement emotion which these reports excited in the bosom of the emperor, was superadded
an alarming consideration. The conflagration of Smolensk was no longer, he saw, the effect
of a fatal and unforeseen accident of war, nor even the result of an act of despair: it was
the result of cool determination. The Russians had studied the time and means, and taken as
great pains to destroy, as are usually taken to preserve.

The same day the courageous answers of one of their popes (the only one found in Smolensk,)
enlightened him still more in regard to the blind fury which had been excited in the whole
Russian nation. His interpreter, alarmed by this animosity, conducted the pope to the emperor.
The venerable priest first reproached him, with firmness, for his alleged sacrilegious acts:
he knew not that it was the Russian general himself who had caused the storehouses and churches
to be set on fire, and who had accused us of these outrages, in order that the mercantile class
and the peasantry might not separate their cause from that of the nobility.

The emperor listened attentively. "But," said he to him at last, "has your church been burned?"--"No,
sire," replied the pope; "God will be more powerful than you; he will protect it, for I have
opened it to all the unfortunate people whom the destruction of the city has deprived of a
home!"--"You are right," rejoined Napoleon, with emotion, "yes, God will watch over the innocent
victims of war; he will reward you for your courage. Go, worthy priest, return to your post.
Had all your popes followed your example, they had not basely betrayed the mission of peace
which they received from heaven; if they had not abandoned the temples which their presence
alone renders sacred, my soldiers would have spared your holy edifices; for we are all Christians,
and your God is our God."

With these words, Napoleon sent back the priest to his temple with an escort and some succours.
A heart-rending shriek arose at the sight of the soldiers penetrating into this asylum. A crowd
of terrified women and children thronged about the altar; but the pope, raising his voice,
cried; "be of good cheer: I have seen Napoleon; I have spoken to him. Oh! how have we been
deceived, my children! the emperor of France is not the man that he has been represented to
you. Learn that he and his soldiers worship the same God as we do. The war which he wages is
not religious, it is a political quarrel with our emperor. His soldiers fight only our soldiers.
They do not slaughter, as we have been assured, old men, women, and children. Cheer up, then,
and let us thank God for being relieved from the painful duty of hating them as heathen, impious
wretches, and incendiaries!" The pope then commenced a hymn of thanks, in which they all joined
with tearful eyes.

But these very words demonstrated how much the nation had been deceived. The rest of the inhabitants
had fled. Henceforward, then, it was not their army alone, it was the population, it was all
Russia, that fled before us. The emperor felt that, with this population, one of his most powerful
engines of conquest was escaping from his hands.

CHAP. IX.

Ever since our arrival at Witepsk, Napoleon had in fact employed two of his officers to sound
the sentiments of these people. The object was, to instil into them notions of liberty, and
to compromise them in our cause by an insurrection more or less general. But there had been
nothing to work upon excepting a few straggling savage boors, whom the Russians had perhaps
left as spies amongst us. This attempt had only served to betray his plan, and to put the Russians
on their guard against it.

This expedient, moreover, was repugnant to Napoleon, whose nature inclined him much more to
the cause of kings than to that of nations. He employed it but carelessly. Subsequently, at
Moscow, he received several addresses from different heads of families. They complained that
they were treated by the nobility like herds of cattle, which they might sell or barter away
at pleasure. They solicited Napoleon to proclaim the abolition of slavery, and in the event
of his doing so, they offered to head partial insurrections, which they promised speedily to
render general.

These offers were rejected. We should have seen, among a barbarous people, a barbarous liberty,
an ungovernable, a horrible licentiousness: a few partial revolts had formerly furnished the
standard of them. The Russian nobles, like the planters of St. Domingo, would have been ruined.
The fear of this prevailed in the mind of Napoleon, and was confessed by him; it induced him
to give up, for a time, all attempts to excite a movement which he could not have regulated.

Besides, these masters had conceived a distrust of their slaves. Amidst so many dangers, they
distinguished this as the most urgent. They first wrought upon the minds of their unfortunate
serfs, debased by all sorts of servitude. Their priests, whom they are accustomed to believe,
imposed upon them by delusive language; they persuaded these peasants that we were legions
of devils, commanded by Antichrist, infernal spirits, whose very look would excite horror,
and whose touch would contaminate. They were trembling from the blows they
had sustained and they were teetering about in dismay at the loudness of it all. The animals scurried
about in a mass of confusion prodded by canes. A mere horse, he was, but he was aiming to bite the monster
headed his way. His teeth and torn flaps of hairy skin were clinging to his body, probably due
to his own will.

He had had to withstand the horrific attack of the bull and had managed to bite into his tender
neck with a furious clench. All of the horses were traumatized and
their neighing showed this.

They
smelt of blood and feces and suffered as well with fumes of sickly
gas from under their tails.

Their blood was sprewn between the stones and it was turning black as it dried.

This commotion endured until the crowd arrived. You could not really see them in the midst of it
all, you could only hear them.

They were shouting exclamations of concern such as, "Ay, ay!" This in turn created quite a loud
decible of noise, considering that there were thousands of onlookers. The banderillero stuck closely
by the bull before he turned to the beast amid an uproar of applause and proceeded to hail two flags
into the air.

At this the trumpets sounded to announce the kill only to find the crowd applauding again.

Carmen wanted to go. Holy Mother Mary! Why was he even here?

That was her husband with the bull and there she was only a few steps from him but still could
not be free of the torment that she felt. She did not like to see the beasts tormented, she did
not like to see the blood running through the courtyard. She also knew that this occasion needed
a persuasive feminine air to help in repelling the foul odors of
the carnage, as she held her handkerchief to her own nose.

She had never seen the bulls for a long time, she had only heard stories of these bullfights.
The stories portrayed a beauty of a lavish arena, a sunny day, irridescent
silk and embroidery which did not tell the tale of the heinous rituals
of preparation and revolting suffering of weaker animals.

To think that the banderillero could acquire his fortune at the expense
of these shows was quite honestly shocking and repulsive.

As she sat and watched the crowd rang out with some more loud applause.
There were orders being made in commanding voices. There was already
one bull dead and the doors were still open at the bottom of the passage.

The
fences around the stables connected around the outer edge of the ring
and seemed to intensify the noises of the crowd and the echoes of
the music that played in the background. In Petersburgh, the centre of the
government, the knot to which all the threads of the administration were united, the brain
of Russia, were her military and naval arsenals; in short, it was the only point of communication
between Russia and England, of which he should possess himself. The victory of Polotsk, of
which he had just received intelligence, seemed to urge him in that direction. By marching
in concert with Saint-Cyr upon Petersburgh, he should envelop Wittgenstein, and cause Riga
to fall before Macdonald.

On the other hand, in Moscow, it was the nobility, as well as the nation, that he should attack
in its property, in its ancient honour; the road to that capital was shorter; it presented
fewer obstacles and more resources; the Russian main army, which he could not neglect, and
which he must destroy, was there, together with the chances of a battle, and the hope of giving
a shock to the nation, by striking at its heart in this national war.

Of these three plans the latter appeared to him the only one practicable, in spite of the advancing
season. The history of Charles XII. was, nevertheless, before his eyes; not that of Voltaire,
which he had just thrown aside with impatience, judging it to be romantic and inaccurate, but
the journal of Adlerfield, which he read, but which did not stop him. On comparing that expedition
with his own, he found a thousand differences between them, on which he laid great stress;
for who can be a judge in his own cause? and of what use is the example of the past, in a world
where there never were two men, two things, or two situations exactly alike?

At any rate, about this period the name of Charles XII. was frequently heard to drop from his lips.

CHAP. X.

But the news which arrived from all quarters excited his ardour quite as much as it had been
at Witepsk. His lieutenants seemed to have done more than himself: the actions of Mohilef,
Molodeczna, and Valoutina, were regular battles, in which Davoust, Schwartzenberg, and Ney,
were conquerors; on his right, his line of operation seemed to be covered; the enemy's army
was flying before him; on his left, the Duke of Reggio, after drawing Wittgenstein upon Polotsk,
was attacked at Slowna, on the 17th of August. The attack of Wittgenstein was furious and obstinate;
it failed; but he retained his offensive position, and Marshal Oudinot had been wounded. Saint-Cyr
succeeded him in the command of that army, composed of about 30,000 French, Swiss, and Bavarians.
The very next day this general, who disliked any command unless when he exercised it alone
and in chief, availed himself of it, to give his measure to his own troops and to the enemy;
but coolly, according to his character, and combining every thing.

From daybreak till five in the evening, he contrived to amuse the enemy by the proposal of
an agreement to withdraw the wounded, and more especially by demonstrations of retreat. At
the same time he silently rallied all his combatants, drew them up into three columns of attack,
and concealed them behind the village of Spas and rising grounds.

At five o'clock, all being ready, and Wittgenstein's vigilance asleep, Saint-Cyr gave the signal:
his artillery immediately began firing, and his columns rushed forward. The Russians, being
taken by surprise, resisted in vain; their right was first broken, and their centre soon fled
in disorder: they abandoned 1000 prisoners, 20 pieces of cannon, a field of battle covered
with slain, and the offensive, which Saint-Cyr, being too weak, could only affect to resume,
for the purpose of better defending himself.

In this short but severe and sanguinary conflict, the right wing of the Russians, which was
supported by the Düna, made an obstinate resistance. It was necessary to charge it with the
bayonet, amidst a thick fire of grape-shot; every thing succeeded, but when it was supposed
that there was no more to do but to pursue, all was nearly lost; some Russian dragoons, according
to some, and horse-guards, according to others, risked a charge on a battery of Saint-Cyr's;
a French brigade placed to support it advanced, then suddenly turned its back and fled through
the midst of our cannon, which it prevented from being fired. The Russians reached them pell-mell
with our men; they sabred the gunners, upset the pieces, and pursued our horse so closely,
that the latter, more and more terrified, ran in disorder upon their commander-in-chief and
his staff, whom they overthrew. General Saint-Cyr was obliged to fly on foot. He threw himself
into the bottom of a ravine, which sheltered him from the squall. The Russian dragoons were
already close to Polotsk, when a prompt and skilful manoeuvre of Berkheim and the 4th French
cuirassiers put an end to this warm affair. The Russians betook themselves to the woods.

The following day Saint-Cyr sent a body of men in pursuit of them, but merely to observe their
retreat, to mark the victory, and to reap some more of its fruits. During the two succeeding
months, up to the 18th of October, Wittgenstein kept at a respectful distance. The French general,
on his part, confined his attention to observing the enemy, keeping up his communications with
Macdonald, with Witepsk, and Smolensk, fortifying himself in his position of Polotsk, and,
above all, finding there means of subsistence.

In this action of the 18th, four generals, four colonels, and many officers, were wounded.
Among them the army remarked the Bavarian Generals Deroy and Liben. They expired on the 22d
of August. By leaning into the fire of the
kitchen, I have everything I need... And if not, to look at it is
enough.

With what rose from the chair and broke to a walk the blessed God, without
giving me time to light with a candle what was in the darkest passages.

To read!

To write! The poor man didn't know that when a man gives way to finding the course of the hours
tedious, he cannot dedicate himself to anything that will distract him, as a law of the naughty
human condition.

That night not a soul came by to the gathering, and the least sad face that was in the kitchen
was that of Facia's, the incomprehensible and mysterious gray woman. My uncle and I, just like
we used to do often, dined in a lazy manner: he would have his corresponding portion of milk, the only
food that had been prescribed by Neluco lately, for being so convenient to his invincible lack
of appetite and to the roots of his illness, and I, the ordinary
condumios of ToÃ±a and her mother, to which my stomach was very grateful.

As the night was so long and I knew how unending it seemed to my poor uncle the part of it that was
destined for people with good health to rest in bed, I procured that we would go to bed as
late as possible. After the three maids had eaten and the plates had been put away, and everyone had
returned to gather at the fire, and I had tried, with little luck, to free ToÃ±a from being
a slave of a drowsiness that kept her in a continuous head bob and Chisco of his suspicious insensibility.
But my uncle, who watched everything, gave said "let's go," and he stood
from his chair, more grateful than satisfied of that so notorious
as useless sacrifice that we were all doing for him.

Before going to bed I went out to the solarium for a moment to see the night. It was still snowing,
and I saw that everything on the sky seemed black and everything on the
ground seemed white, without anyone disturbing the serenity of that
melancholic frame with those rumors of the river, very choppy with
the tributes of the sleet passages, and that who picked the snow
that melted as it touched him.

I woke up very early the next day and to satisfy a childish curiosity, I looked through the balcony
very well clothed. It had stopped snowing, but the sky was cloudy like the color of a donkey's belly.
I had seen it snow in Madrid, Paris and St. Petersburg... many times, but always in flat land and
in between the streets: like a carpet of canvas somewhat dirty on the streets and blankets of white
duvets laid on the roofs; snow, alas, theatrical, without the slightest resemblance to what I
was seeing from my uncle's balcony. It was as if the mountains of the contour had tripled their
height and the unity of the color of all of them with the round shapes that gave them their accumulation
of the snow over their natural and rough edges, changed in my eyes the edges and all the lines
of the panorama that was so familiar to me. I could not find in the new panorama a sole detail
with which to find myself to reconstruct what had been erased in so few hours. Trees, trails,
valleys, everything had disappeared, or was under the snow, or was concealed by the tricks
of the light; sky, hills, valleys... they were all the same to a manner
in which I would be under the refined salt or lime.

At the same time he ordered Montbrun to pass the ravine on his right with his cavalry, in order
to reconnoitre and get upon the left of the enemy. Davoust, and his five divisions of infantry,
extended themselves on that side; he protected Montbrun: the king recalled them to his left,
on the high-road, designing, it is said, to support Montbrun's flank movement by some demonstrations
in front.

Davoust replied, that "This would be sacrificing our right wing, through which the enemy would
get behind us on the high-road, our only means of retreat; that thus he would force us to a
battle, which he, Davoust, had orders to avoid, and which he would avoid, his force being insufficient,
the position bad, and he being moreover under the command of a leader in whom he had but little
confidence." He then wrote immediately to Napoleon, urging him to come up without loss of time,
if he would not have Murat engage without him.

On this intelligence, which he received in the night of the 24th of August, Napoleon joyfully
threw aside his indecision, which to this enterprising and decisive genius was absolute torture:
he hurried forward with his guard, and proceeded twelve leagues without halting; but on the
evening of the preceding day, the enemy's army had again disappeared.

On our side, his retreat was attributed to the movement of Montbrun; on the part of the Russians
to Barclay, and to a bad position chosen by the chief of his staff, who had taken up ground
in his own disfavour, instead of making it serve to his advantage. Bagration was the first
who perceived it; his rage knew no bounds, and he proclaimed it treason.

Discord reigned in the Russian camp as well as in our advanced guard. Confidence in their commander,
that strength of armies, was wanting; his every step seemed a blunder; each resolution that
was taken the very worst. The loss of Smolensk had soured all; the junction of the two corps
d'armée increased the evil; the stronger the Russian force felt itself, the weaker did its
general seem to it. The outcry became general; another leader was loudly called for. A few
prudent men, however, interposed: Kutusof was announced, and the humbled pride of the Russians
awaited him in order to fight.

The emperor, on his part, already at Dorogobouje, no longer hesitated; he knew that he carried
every where with him the fate of Europe; that wherever he might be, that would always be the
place where the destiny of nations would be decided; that he might therefore advance, fearless
of the threatening consequences of the defection of the Swedes and Turks. Thus he neglected
the hostile armies of Essen at Riga, of Wittgenstein before Polotsk, of Ertell before Bobruisk,
and of Tchitchakof in Volhynia. They consisted of 120,000 men, whose number could not but keep
gradually augmenting; he passed them, and suffered himself to be surrounded by them with indifference,
assured that all these vain obstacles of war and policy would be swept away by the very first
thunderbolt which he should launch.

And yet, his column of attack, which was 185,000 strong at his departure from Witepsk, was
already reduced to 157,000; it was diminished by 28,000 men, half of whom occupied Witepsk,
Orcha, Mohilef, and Smolensk. The rest had been killed or wounded, or were straggling, and
plundering in his rear our allies and the French themselves.

But 157,000 men were sufficient to destroy the Russian army by a complete victory, and to take
Moscow. As to his base of operation, notwithstanding the 120,000 Russians by whom it was threatened,
it appeared to be secure. Lithuania, the Düna, the Dnieper, and lastly Smolensk, were or would
soon be covered towards Riga and Dünabourg by Macdonald and 32,000 men; towards Polotsk, by
Saint-Cyr, with 30,000; at Witepsk, Smolensk, and Mohilef, by Victor and 40,000; before Bobruisk,
by Dombrowski and 12,000; and on the Bug by Schwartzenberg and Regnier, at the head of 45,000
men. Napoleon reckoned besides on the divisions of Loison and Durutte, 22,000 strong, which
were already approaching Königsberg and Warsaw; and on reinforcements to the amount of 80,000,
all of which would enter Russia before the middle of November.

He should thus have 280,000 men, including the Lithuanian and Polish levies, to support him,
while, with 155,000 more, he made an incursion of 93 leagues; for such was the distance between
Smolensk and Moscow.

But these 280,000 men were commanded by six different leaders, all independent of each other,
and the most elevated of them, he who occupied the centre, and who seemed to be appointed to
act as an intermediate link, to give some unity to the operations of the other five, was a
minister of peace, and not of war.

Besides, the same causes which had already diminished, by one-third, the French forces which
first entered Russia, could not fail to disperse or to destroy a still greater proportion of
all these reinforcements. Most of them were coming by detachments, formed provisionally into
marching battalions under officers new to them, whom they were to leave the first day, without
the incentive of discipline, esprit de corps, or glory, and traversing an exhausted country,
which the season and the climate would be rendering daily more bare and more rude.

Meanwhile Napoleon beheld Dorogobouje in ashes, like Smolensk, especially the quarter of the
merchants, those who had most to lose, whom their riches might have detained or brought back
amongst us, and who, from their situation, formed a kind of intermediate class, a commencement
of the third estate, which liberty was likely to seduce.

He was perfectly aware that he was quitting Smolensk, as he had come thither, with the hope
of a battle, which the indecision and discord of the Russian generals had as yet deferred;
but his resolution was taken; he would hear of nothing but what was calculated to support him
in it. He persisted in pursuing the track of the enemy; his hardihood increased with their
prudence; their circumspection he called pusillanimity, their retreat flight; he despised,
that he might hope.

BOOK VII.

CHAP. I.

The emperor had proceeded with such expedition to Dorogobouje, that he was obliged to halt
there, in order to wait for his army, and to leave Murat to pursue the enemy. He set out again
on the 26th of August; the army marched in three columns abreast; the Emperor, Murat, Davoust,
and Ney in the centre, on the high-road to Moscow; Poniatowski on the right; and the army of
Italy on the left.

The principal column, that of the centre, found nothing on a road where its advanced guard
itself had to subsist entirely on the leavings of the Russians; it could not digress from its
direction, for want of time, in so rapid a march. Besides, the columns on the right and left
consumed every thing on either side of it. In order to live better, it ought to have set out
later every day, halted earlier, and then extended itself more on its flanks during the night;
which could be done without imprudence when the enemy was so near at hand.

At Smolensk orders had been issued, as at Witepsk, to take, at starting, provisions for several
days. The emperor was aware of the difficulty of collecting them, but he reckoned upon the
diligence of the officers and the troops; they had warning,--that was sufficient; they would
contrive to provide themselves with necessaries. They had acquired the habit of doing so; and
it was really a curious sight to observe the voluntary and continual efforts of so many men
to follow a single individual to such great distances. The existence of the army was a prodigy
that was daily renewed, by the active, industrious, and intelligent spirit of the French and
Polish troops, by their habit of surmounting all difficulties, and by their fondness for the
hazards and irregularities of this dreadful game of an adventurous life.

In the train of each regiment there were a multitude of those diminutive horses with which
Poland swarms, a great number of carts of the country, which required to be incessantly replaced
with fresh ones, and a drove of cattle. The baggage-waggons were driven by soldiers, for they
turned their hands to every trade. They were missed in the ranks, it is true; but here the
want of provisions, the necessity for transporting every thing with them, excused this prodigious
train: it required a second army, as it were, to carry or draw what was indispensable for the
first.

In this prompt organization, adopted while marching, the army had accommodated itself to all
the local customs and difficulties; the genius of the soldiers had admirably made the most
of the scanty resources of the country. As to the officers, as the general orders always took
for granted regular distributions which were never made, each of them, according to the degree
of his zeal, intelligence, and firmness, appropriated to himself more or less of this spoil,
and had converted individual pillage into regular contributions.

For it was only by excursions on the flanks and into an unknown country that any provisions
could be procured. Every evening, when the army halted, and the bivouacs were established,
detachments, rarely commanded by divisions, sometimes by brigades, and most commonly by regiments,
went in quest of necessaries, and penetrated into the country; a few wersts from the road they
found all the villages inhabited, and were not very hostilely received; but as they could not
make themselves understood, and besides wanted every thing, and that instantaneously, the peasants
were soon seized with a panic and fled into the woods, whence they issued again as no very
formidable partizans.

The detachments meanwhile plentifully regaled themselves, and rejoined their corps next day
or some days afterwards, laden with all that they had collected; and it frequently happened
that they were plundered in their turn by their comrades belonging to the other corps whom
they chanced to fall in with. Hence animosities, which would have infallibly led to most sanguinary
intestine conflicts, had not all been subsequently overtaken by the same misfortune, and involved
in the horrors of a common disaster.

Till the return of their detachments, the soldiers who remained with their eagles lived on
what they could find on the military route; in general it consisted of new rye, which they
bruised and boiled. Owing to the cattle which followed, there was less want of meat than of
bread; but the length, and especially the rapidity of the marches, occasioned the loss of many
of these animals: they were suffocated by the heat and dust; when, therefore, they came to
water, they ran into it with such fury, that many of them were drowned, while others drank
so immoderately, as to swell themselves out till they were unable to walk.

It was remarked, as before we reached Smolensk, that the divisions of the first corps continued
to be the most numerous; their detachments, better disciplined, brought back more, and did
less injury to the inhabitants. Those who remained with their colours lived on the contents
of their knapsacks, the regular appearance of which relieved the eye, fatigued with a disorder
that was nearly universal.

Each of these knapsacks, reduced to what was strictly necessary in point of apparel, contained
two shirts, two pair of shoes with nails, and a pair of extra soles, a pair of pantaloons and
half-gaiters of cloth; a few articles requisite to cleanliness, a bandage, and a quantity of
lint, and sixty cartridges.

In the two sides were placed four biscuits of sixteen ounces each; under these, and at the
bottom, was a long, narrow, linen bag, filled with ten pounds of flour. The whole knapsack
and its contents, together with the straps and the hood, rolled up and fastened at top, weighed
thirty-three pounds twelve ounces.

Each soldier carried also a linen bag, slung in form of a shoulder-belt, containing two loaves
of three pounds each. Thus with his sabre, his loaded knapsack, three flints, his turn-screw,
his belt and musket, he had to carry fifty-eight pounds weight, and was provided with bread
for four days, biscuit for four, flour for seven, and sixty rounds of ammunition.

Behind it were carriages laden with provisions for six more days; but it was impossible to
reckon with confidence on these vehicles, picked up on the spot, which would have been so convenient
in any other country with a smaller army, and in a more regular war.

When the flour-bag was emptied, it was filled with any corn that could be found, and which
was ground at the first mill, if any chanced to be met with; if not, by the hand-mills which
followed the regiments, or which were found in the villages, for the Russians are scarcely
acquainted with any others. It took sixteen men twelve hours to grind in one of them the corn
necessary for one hundred and thirty men for one day.

As every house in this country has an oven, little want was felt on that score; bakers abounded;
for the regiments of the first corps contained men of all trades, so that articles of food
and clothing were all made or repaired by them during the march. They were colonies uniting
the character of civilized and nomadic. The emperor had first conceived the idea, which the
genius of the prince of Eckmühl had appropriated; he had every thing he wanted, time, place,
and men to carry it into execution; but these three elements of success were less at the disposal
of the other chiefs. Besides, their characters being more impetuous and less methodical, would
scarcely have derived the same advantages from it; with a less organizing genius, they would
therefore have had more obstacles to surmount; the emperor had not paid sufficient attention
to these differences, which were productive of baneful effects.

CHAP. II.

It was from Slawkowo, a few leagues beyond Dorogobouje, that Napoleon sent orders, on the 27th
of August, to marshal Victor, who was then on the Niemen, to advance to Smolensk. This marshal's
left was to occupy Witepsk, his right Mohilef, and his centre Smolensk. There he would succour
Saint-Cyr, in case of need, serve for a point of support to the army of Moscow, and keep up
his communications with Lithuania.

It was also from the same imperial head-quarters that he published the details of his review
at Valoutina, with the intention of proclaiming to the present and future ages the names even
of the private soldiers who had there distinguished themselves. But he added, that at Smolensk
"the conduct of the Poles had astonished the Russians, who had been accustomed to despise them."
These words drew from the Poles an outcry of indignation, and the emperor smiled at an anger
which he had foreseen, and the effects of which were designed to fall exclusively on the Russians.

On this march he took delight in dating from the heart of Old Russia a number of decrees, which
would be circulated in the meanest hamlets of France; from the desire of appearing to be present
every where at once, and filling the earth more and more with his power: the offspring of that
inconceiveable and expanding greatness of soul, whose ambition was at first a mere plaything,
but finally coveted the empire of the world.
