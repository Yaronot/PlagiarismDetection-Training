103. The anxiety of this pious teacher was to press upon his hearers to take special heed,
not to receive any truth upon trust from any man, but to pray over it and search 'the Holy
Word.' This, Mr. Southey designates, 'doctrine of a most perilous kind.' How happy would it
be for society if every religious teacher pressed this perilous doctrine upon their hearers,
that it might bring forth the same fruit universally, as it did specially in Bunyan. Compare

108. Luther fell into the same mistake as to the Baptists, that Bunyan did as to the Quakers.
Both were keenly alive to the honour of Christianity, and were equally misled by the loose
conduct of some unworthy professors. Luther charges the Baptists as being 'devils possessed
with worse devils' [Preface to Galatians]. 'It is all one whether he be called a Frank, a Turk,
a Jew, or an Anabaptist' [Com. Gal. iv. 8, 9]. 'Possessed with the devil, seditious, and bloody
men' [Gal. v. 19]. Even a few days before his death, he wrote to his wife, 'Dearest Kate, we
reached Halle at eight o'clock, but could not get on to Eisleben, for there met us a great
Anabaptist, with waves and lumps of ice, which threatened us with a second baptism.' Bunyan,
in the same spirit, calls the Quakers 'a company of loose ranters, light notionists, shaking
in their principles!' [Vol. ii., p. 133, 9, 21]. Denying the Scriptures and the resurrection
[Com. Gal. iv. 29]. These two great men went through the same furnace of the regeneration;
and Bunyan, notwithstanding Luther's prejudices against the Baptists, most affectionately recommended
his Comment on the Galatians, as an invaluable work for binding up the broken-hearted.

116. The study of those scriptures, in order that the solemn question might be safely resolved,
'Can such a fallen sinner rise again?' was like the investigation of the title to an estate
upon which a whole livelihood depended. Every apparent flaw must be critically examined. Tremblingly
alive to the importance of a right decision, his prayers were most earnest; and at length,
to his unspeakable delight, the word of the law and wrath gave place to that of life and grace.

133. The sufferings of the Episcopalians were severe; they drank the bitter cup which they
had shortly before administered to the Puritans. Under suspicion of disloyalty to the Commonwealth,
they were most unjustly compelled to swallow the Covenant as a religious test, or leave preaching
and teaching. Their miseries were not to be compared with those of the Puritans. Laud was beheaded
for treason, but none were put to death for nonconformity. It was an age when religious liberty
was almost unknown. These sufferings were repaid by an awful retaliation and revenge, when
Royalty and Episcopacy were restored.

164. This secrecy became needful after the Restoration, as noticed more fully afterwards, p.
lix. During those years of persecution, a frequent place of resort was a dell in Wain-wood,
about three miles from Hitchin. Of this locality the following notice will be acceptable:--On
the 19th of May, 1853, a splendidly hot day, my pilgrimage to the shrines of Bunyan was continued
at Hitchin and its vicinity, in company with S. B. Geard, Esq. Here it was my honour to shake
hands with honest Edward Foster, whose grandfather often entertained and sheltered John Bunyan.
So singular a case I had never met with, that three lives should connect, in a direct line,
evidence of transactions which occurred at a distance of 190 years. His grandfather was born
in 1642, and for many years was a friend and companion of the illustrious dreamer. In 1706,
when he was sixty-four years of age, his youngest son was born, and in 1777, when that son
was seventy-one years of age, his youngest son was born, and in 1853 he has the perfect use
of limbs and faculties, and properly executes the important office of assistant overseer to
his extensive parish. With such direct testimony, we visited the very romantic dell, where,
in the still hours of midnight, the saints of God were wont to meet and unite in Divine worship.
It is a most romantic dell, in Wain-wood, which crowns a hill about three miles from Hitchin.
We had some difficulty in making our way through the underwood--crushing the beautiful hyacinths
and primroses which covered the ground in the richest profusion, and near the top of the hill
came suddenly upon this singular dell--a natural little eminence formed the pulpit, while the
dell would hold under its shade at least a thousand people--and now I must give you the countryman's
eloquent description of the meetings of his ancestors. "Here, under the canopy of heaven, with
the rigour of winter's nipping frost, while the clouds, obscuring the moon, have discharged
their flaky treasures, they often assembled while the highly-gifted and heavenly-minded Bunyan
has broken to them the bread of life. The word of the Lord was precious in those days. And
here over his devoted head, while uncovered in prayer, the pious matrons warded off the driving
hail and snow, by holding a shawl over him by its four corners. In this devoted dell these
plain unpolished husbandmen, like the ancient Waldenses, in the valleys of Piedmont, proved
themselves firm defenders of the faith in its primitive purity, and of Divine worship in its
primitive style."

Their horses on which they rode, from various parts, were sheltered in neighbouring friendly
farms, while they, to avoid suspicion, ascended the hill by scarcely visible footpaths. Could
fine weather be insured, it would form a lovely spot for a meeting to celebrate the third jubilee
of religious toleration--there listen to a Bunyan of our age, and devise measures for religious
equality. Then we might close the service by solemnly objuring every system which gave power
to tyrannise over the rights of conscience. Here, as in other places where Bunyan founded churches,
the cause of Christ hath spread. At Hitchin, in 1681, about thirty-five Christians united in
the following covenant:--

'We who, through the mercy of God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have obtained grace to give ourselves
to the Lord, and one to another by the will of God, to have communion with one another, as
saints in one gospel fellowship:--Do, before God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and
the holy angels, agree and promise to walk together in this one gospel communion and fellowship
as a church of Jesus Christ, in love to the Lord and one to another, and endeavour to yield
sincere and hearty obedience to the laws, ordinances, and appointments of our Lord and Lawgiver
in his church. And also do agree and promise, the Lord assisting, to follow after the things
which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another, that so living and walking
in love and peace, the God of love and peace may be with us. Amen.'

This was probably drawn by Bunyan, and so simple and comprehensive has it proved, that the
church has flourished, and lately a spacious and handsome place of worship has been erected,
to accommodate a thousand worshippers, at a cost of £3000, all paid for, with a surplus fund
in hand for contingencies, of £500. In addition, there are also large and commodious chapels
for the Independents, Wesleyans, and Quakers.

174. Nehemiah Coxe is said to have been a descendant from Dr. Richard Coxe, preceptor to Edward
VI, and Dean of Oxford. He fled from persecution under Mary, was a troubler of his brother
refugees by his turbulent temper, and his attachment to superstitious ceremonies. On his return,
he was made Bishop of Ely, and became a bitter persecutor. Benjamin Coxe, A.M., probably a
son of the furious bishop, was as ardently fond of rites and ceremonies. He was cited to appear
before Laud for denying the jure divino of bishops, and the poor bishop said, "God did so bless
me that I gave him satisfaction." Mr. Coxe soon after came out as a Baptist, and having preached
at Bedford, he settled in Coventry. Here he disputed with Mr. Baxter and the Presbyterians;
and the Independents had him imprisoned for defending adult baptism (Crosby, History of Baptists,
i. 354), a very short mode of settling the controversy. Probably Nehemiah Coxe was his son,
settled at Bedford as a shoemaker. He was a learned man, and, when tried at Bedford assizes
for preaching the gospel, he was indicted in the usual Norman-French, or Latin; and pleaded
first in Greek, which the prosecutors not understanding, he pleaded in Hebrew, arguing, that
as his indictment was in a foreign tongue, he was entitled to plead in any of the learned languages.
The counsel being ignorant of those languages, and the judge glad to get rid of a vexatious
indictment, dismissed him, saying to the counselors, 'Well, this cordwainer hath wound you
all up, gentlemen.' This anecdote is handed down in a funeral sermon by T. Sutcliff, on the
death of Symonds, one of the pastors of the church at Bedford.

Another of this little band that was set apart with Bunyan, became so useful a preacher as
to have been honoured with a record in the annals of persecution in the reign of Charles II.
John Fenn was on Lord's-day, May 15, 1670, committed to prison for preaching in his own house;
and on Tuesday, all his goods and stock in trade were seized and carted away, leaving his family
in the most desolate condition.

In the following week, Edward Isaac, a blacksmith, another of this little band, having been
fined, had all his stock in trade, and even the anvil upon which he worked, seized and carted away.

Such were the severe trials which these excellent citizens were, with their families, called
to pass through, by the tyranny of the church; but they were light, indeed, in comparison with
those that awaited the amiable and pious Bunyan.

175. If Christians recollected with what anxiety their teachers prepared and delivered their
sermons, how constant and prayerful would be their attendance on the means of grace.

176. Grace Abounding, vol. i., p. 42. The taunts and revilings of a poet laureate upon Bunyan's
preaching and sufferings need only a passing notice. No words could be more vile and slanderous
than those of Mr. Southey. He says, 'Peace might be on his lips, and zeal for the salvation
of others in his heart, but he was certainly, at that time, no preacher of good will, nor of
Christian charity.' How can we judge of a preacher's good will, but by 'peace on his lips?'
and what is the criterion of Christian charity, except it be 'zeal for the salvation of others
in his heart?'

186. The American authors of a recent life of Burrough, (William and Thomas Evans, Philadelphia,
republished by Gilpin, London, 1851), have given an unfair account of his controversy with
Bunyan, drawn from Burrough's works in the shape of a supposed dialogue. Such a disputation
can only be understood by reading both sides of the question. We unite with them in admiring
the character of that young but noble martyr. They are, however, wrong in their conclusion
that 'the meekness and gentleness of Christ softened and adorned his whole character.' He was
one of those that are called in the Holy War, 'rough hewn men fit to break the ice.' Vol. iii.
