Though the history of that regiment's career has been written in full detail, the purpose of
this slight repetition of the story needs no apology. There is sufficient justification in
its intrinsic interest, to say nothing of a personal interest in its members, men who gave
such proofs of their quality, and whose survivors are still our neighbors in probably every
town in the county.

There is also something more than mere interest to be gained, in considering historical matters
of such immensity as the Civil War, in giving the attention to some minute section of the whole,
such as the account of individual experiences, or of the career of a particular regiment such
as this; it is of great value as bringing an adequate realization of the actual bearing of
the great events of that time upon the people of the time. The story of a body of Litchfield
County men, such men as we see every day, drawn from such homes as we know all about us, is
a potent help to understanding in what way and with what aspects these great historical movements
bore upon the people of the country, for the experience of this group of towns and their sons
furnished but one small instance of what was borne, infinitely magnified, throughout the nation.

It will readily appear that the subject might furnish material for a notable volume. In the
present case nothing is possible save a brief sketch of the matter, made up chiefly, as will
be seen, of citations from the published history of the regiment, and from such other sources
of information as were easily accessible. Among the latter must be noted the records of the
Regimental Association, to which access was had through the courtesy of its secretary, D. C.
Kilbourn, Esq., of Litchfield, and his assistance, as well as that of H. W. Wessells, Esq.,
of Litchfield, to both of whom the securing of most of the illustrations used is due, is gratefully
acknowledged.

THE COUNTY REGIMENT

In spite of the labors of unnumbered chroniclers, it is not easy, if indeed it is possible,
for us of this later generation to realize adequately the great patriotic uprising of the war
times.

It began in the early days of 1861 with the assault on Fort Sumter, which, following a long
and trying season of uncertainty, furnished the sudden shock that resolved the doubts of the
wavering and changed the opinions of the incredulous. Immediately there swept over all the
northern states a wave of intense national feeling, attended by scenes of patriotic and confident
enthusiasm more noisy than far-sighted, and there was a resulting host of volunteers, who went
forth for the service of ninety days with the largest hopes, and proportionate ignorance of
the crisis which had come to the nation. Of these Connecticut furnished more than her allotted
share, and Litchfield County a due proportion.

The climax of this excited period was supplied by the battle of Bull Run. There was surprise,
and almost consternation, at the first news of this salutary event, but quickly following,
a renewed rally of patriotic feeling, less excited but more determined, and with a clearer
apprehension of the actual situation. The enlistment of volunteers for a longer term had been
begun, and now went forward briskly for many months; regiment after regiment was enrolled,
equipped, and sent southward, until, in the spring of 1862, the force of this movement began
to spend itself. The national arms had met with some important successes during the winter,
and a feeling of confidence had arisen in the invincibility of the Grand Army of the Potomac,
which had been gathering and organizing under General McClellan for what the impatient country
was disposed to think an interminable time. A War Department order in April, 1862, putting
a stop to recruiting for the armies, added to the confidence, since an easy inference could
be drawn from it, and the North settled down to await with high hopes the results of McClellan's
long expected advance.

Then came the campaign on the Peninsula. At first there was but meagre news and a multitude
of conflicting rumors about its fierce battles and famous retreat, but in the end the realization
of the failure of this mighty effort. To the country it was a disappointment literally stunning
in its proportions; but now at length there was revealed the magnitude of the task confronting
the nation, and again there sprang up the determination, grim and intense, to strain every
nerve for the restoration of the Union.

The President's call for three hundred thousand men to serve "for three years or the war" was
proclaimed to this state by Governor Buckingham on July 3rd (1862), and evidence was at once
forthcoming that it was sternly heeded by the people. To fill Connecticut's quota under this
call, it was proposed that regiments should be raised by counties. A convention was promptly
called, which met in Litchfield on July 22nd; delegates from every town in the county were
in attendance, representatives of all shades of political opinion and individual bias, but
the conclusions of the meeting were unanimously reached. It was resolved that Litchfield County
should furnish an entire regiment of volunteers, and that Leverett W. Wessells, at that time
Sheriff, should be recommended as its commander.

Immediate steps were taken to render this determination effective; the Governor promptly accepted
the recommendation as to the colonelcy, recruiting officers were designated to secure enlistments,
bounties voted by the different towns as proposed by the county meeting, and the movement thoroughly
organized. Although there was a clear appreciation of the present need, the dozen or more Connecticut
regiments already in the field had drawn a large number of men from Litchfield County, and
effort was necessary to gain the required enrollment. There had been many opportunities already
for all to volunteer who had any wish to do so, but the call now came to men who a few weeks
before had hardly dreamed of the need of their serving; men not to be attracted by the excitement
of a novel adventure, but who recognized soberly the duty that was presenting itself in this
emergency, and men of a very different stamp from those drawn into the ranks in the later years
of the war by enormous bounties. It is reasonable to think that pride in the success of the
county's effort was a factor in stimulating enlistments; announcement that a draft would be
resorted to later was doubtless another. Just at this time, also, the return from a year's
captivity in the South of the Rev. Hiram Eddy of Winsted, who had been made prisoner at Bull
Run, furnished a powerful advocate to the cause; night after night he spoke in different towns,
urging the call to service fervently and with effect. So notorious was
and disorder, that Zapata, terrified, looking to come the thunder fat, had to overcome drowsiness
in which he had half his face, and began to make numbers and want to set method and rationale
in the government of his estate, but oh sad fate of the family! when I was more engrossed man
in his arithmetic, waiting for his salvation, caught pneumonia and passed away life on Friday afternoon,
leaving two young children: Antonito and Obdulia.

Flow manager and owner of assets and liabilities, Francisca soon demonstrated his ineptitude to manage
these tangled issues, and next came, like worms in body corrupt, countless people who ate it inside
and out, devouring her mercilessly. In this disastrous time, went to her benign, if from the
first day was credited excellent cook, a few weeks had to prove to be the most intrepid ssion
of Madrid. What may be the girl in this field, the same Dona Francisca, a radical myopia for inspection
of their interests, could appreciate the thorough rapacity of the servant, and still determined
to correct it. In fairness, I must say Benign (among his call Benin, simply by Mrs. Nina) had
very good qualities that, in some way compensated, on the inequality of his character, one
serious defect of the armhole. It was very clean, amazing activity that produced the miracle
of enlarging the hours and days. Besides this, she estimated Francisca intense love for the
children of the house, love sincere and, if you will, positive, revealed in the constant surveillance,
in exquisite care that sick or attending them.

The preparation and drill which employed the scant two weeks spent here were supervised by
Lieutenant-Colonel Kellogg, fresh from McClellan's army in Virginia, and he was afterwards
reported as delivering the opinion that if there were nine hundred men in the camp, there were
certainly nine thousand women most of the time.

With all possible haste, preparations were made for an early departure, but there was opportunity
for a formal mustering of the regiment in Litchfield, when a fine set of colors was presented
by William Curtis Noyes, Esq., in behalf of his wife. A horse for the Colonel was given also,
by the Hon. Robbins Battell, saddle and equipments by Judge Origen S. Seymour, and a sword
by the deputies who had served under Sheriff Wessells.

On September 15th (1862), the eight hundred and eighty-nine officers and men now mustered as
the Nineteenth Connecticut Volunteer Infantry broke camp, made their first march to East Litchfield
station, and started for the South, with the entire population for miles around gathered to
witness, not as a holiday spectacle, but as a farewell, grave with significance, the departure
of the county regiment.

"In order to raise it," says the regimental history, "Litchfield County had given up the flower
of her youth, the hope and pride of hundreds of families, and they had by no means enlisted
to fight for a superior class of men at home. There was no superior class at home. In moral
qualities, in social worth, in every civil relation, they were the best that Connecticut had
to give. More than fifty of the rank and file of the regiment subsequently found their way
to commissions, and at least a hundred more proved themselves not a whit less competent or
worthy to wear sash and saber if it had been their fortune." Even the most conscienceless libertines figure we all means trouble before,
and though will not find any, they will stop frightened before proposing to her friends this way
of numbing the mother or husband to have them then peacefully. Moreover, Margarita, who was alone in the
house of Martha, unscrupulous woman and that everything is paid,
what need was to infuse his mother sleep?

We
say that infanticide is worse, that infanticide is the most heinous
of crimes, but infanticide was necessary to motivate the torture of
Margarita, whose goodness is spared thanks to delirium.

Mad, throws his son into a pond, where they drowned, while his mother gives him the narcotics intentionally,
all over the clearing of his trial, and without the narcotic remove or put the argument or development
of the action. Is a refinement of realism mischief and sinful, and is entirely useless to spare. Dreadful
crime is also the death of Valentin given at close range by Faust,
but it was inevitable, is justified aesthetically.

Also, here is forgive any defect in the poet, if he had, in favor
of the tough character and military honor, the brother of Margarita.

The pride and arrogance that inspired her, before his fall, the anger that causes the loss of his
honor, all he utters the words before and during the duel, and its terrible counterclaims to Margarita,
when moribund, all this is real and beautiful at the same time.


In this vicinity the regiment was destined to remain for many months, and to learn, as far
as was possible without the grim teachings of actual experience, the business for which it
was gathered. At first there was a constant expectation of orders to join the army in active
operations; the county newspapers for many weeks noted regularly that the regiment was still
near Alexandria, "but orders to march are hourly expected." It was good fortune, however, that
none came, for not a little of the credit of its later service was due to the proficiency in
discipline and soldierly qualities gained in the long months now spent in preparation.

The task of giving the necessary military education to the thousand odd men fresh from the
ordinary routine of rural Connecticut life, fell upon the shoulders of Lieutenant-Colonel Kellogg,
and by all the testimony available, most of all by the splendid proof they later gave, it is
clear that it was entrusted to a master hand. Matters of organization and administration at
first engrossed Colonel Wessells' attention; ill health soon supervened, and later he was given
the command of a brigade. The regiment from its beginning was Kellogg's, and he received in
due course the commission vacated by its first commander in September, 1863.

A thorough and well-tried soldier himself, he quickly gained the respect of his command by
his complete competency, and its strong and admiring affection was not slow in following. There
are men among us to this day for whom no superlatives are adequate to give expression to their
feelings in regard to him. As the regimental history records of their career "there is not
a scene, a day, nor a memory from Camp Dutton to Grapevine Point that can be wholly divested
of Kellogg. Like the ancient Eastern king who suddenly died on the eve of an engagement, and
whose remains were bolstered up in warlike attitude in his chariot, and followed by his enthusiastic
soldiers to battle and to victory, so this mighty leader, although falling in the very first
onset, yet went on through every succeeding march and fight, and won posthumous victories for
the regiment which may be said to have been born of his loins. Battalion and company, officer
and private, arms and quarters, camp and drill, command and obedience, honor and duty, esprit
and excellence, every moral and material belonging of the regiment, bore the impress of his
genius. In the eyes of civilians, Colonel Kellogg was nothing but a horrid, strutting, shaggy
monster. But request any one of the survivors of the Nineteenth Infantry or the Second Artillery
to name the most perfect soldier he ever saw, and this will surely be the man. Or ask him to
conjure up the ideal soldier of his imagination, still the same figure, complete in feature,
gesture, gauntlet, saber, boot, spur, observant eye and commanding voice, will stalk with majestic
port upon the mental vision. He seemed the superior of all superiors, and major-generals shrunk
into pigmy corporals in comparison with him. In every faculty of body, mind, heart, and soul
he was built after a large pattern. His virtues were large and his vices were not small. As
Lincoln said of Seward, he could swear magnificently. His nature was versatile, and full of
contradictions; sometimes exhibiting the tenderest sensibilities and sometimes none at all. To attenuate
the sad hours, they were extracting forces of weakness, making the moments of the night happy
with affected fantasmagorÃ­as, when they were turning out to be free of annoying creditors and of
annoying claims. It was necessary to do new changes, looking for the cheap thing, and from the
Elm tree they went on to the Elder, and from the Elder to the Almond tree. For this fatality of
the names of trees in the streets where they lived, they were looking
like birds that were flying of branch in branch, dispersed by the
shotguns of the hunters or the blows with a stone of the boys. 'In rage, deaf
as the sea, hasty as fire.' But notwithstanding his frequent ill treatment of officers and
soldiers, he had a hold on their affections such as no other commander ever had, or could have.
The men who were cursing him one day for the almost intolerable rigors of his discipline, would
in twenty-four hours be throwing up their caps for him, or subscribing to buy him a new horse,
or petitioning the Governor not to let him be jumped. The man who sat on a sharp-backed wooden
horse in front of the guard house, would sometimes watch the motions of the Colonel on drill
or parade, until he forgot the pain and disgrace of his punishment in admiration of the man
who inflicted it.
