But at length they rode over a quarter where McCrae turned his horse and rode back again. Forward
and back, forward and back, they rode the whole hundred and sixty acres, until not a rood of
it had escaped their scrutiny. On the south-east corner a stream, in a ravine of some depth,
cut off a triangle of a few acres' extent. Otherwise it was prairie sod, almost level, with
yellow clay lying at the badger holes. Down in the ravine, where they had been sheltered from
fire, were red willows, choke-cherry bushes, and a few little poplars and birches; a winding
pond marked the course of the stream, which was running in considerable volume. Even as they
stood on the bank a great cracking was heard, and huge blocks of ice rose to the surface of
the pond. Some of these as they rose turned partly on their edge, showing two smooth sides.

"Good!" exclaimed McCrae. "There's some depth of water there. That pond hasn't frozen solid,
or the ice wouldn't come up like that. That means water all winter for stock, independent of
your well--a mighty important consideration, which a lot of these land-grabbers don't seem
to reckon on. Now there's a good quarter, Jack. I don't say it's the best there is; they'll
be opening up new land that'd make your teeth water twenty-five years from now. But we can't
explore the whole North-West, an' you're far enough from the railroad here. This coulee will
give shelter for your stock in raw weather, an' there's a bench looks at though it was put
there for your little house. There's light timber to the north, fit for fuel an' building,
within fifteen miles, an' there'll be neighbours here before the summer's over, or I'm no prophet.
What do you say?"

"The quarter suits me," said Harris. "And the adjoining quarter is good stuff too. I can take
pre-emption right on that. But there's just one thing I'm in doubt about."

"What's that?"

"How I'm going to square it with you for the service you have given. My cash is getting low, and--"

"Don't worry about that. I generally size up my customer an' bill him accordingly. If he has
lots of money, an' seems likely to part with it foolishly, I put as much of it as I can in
safe keeping. But there isn't any money fee as far as you're concerned. Fact is, I kinda figure
on trading this bill out with you."

"Trading it out? How?"

"Well, I expect to be roving this country, east an' west, for some years to come, an' I've
a little policy of establishing depots here an' there--places where I can drop in for a square
meal an' a sleep an' a bit of Western hospitality. Places, too, if you like, where there are
men to say a good word for Aleck McCrae. How's that suit you?"

Harris took his friend's hand in a warm grip. He rightly guessed that McCrae was not bartering
his services for hospitality, but was making it easy for Harris to accept them by appearing
to bargain for a service in return. So they shook hands together on the side of the bank overlooking
the little coulee, and as they looked in each other's eyes Harris realized for the first time
that McCrae was still a young man. A sense of comradeship came over him--a feeling that this
man was more of a brother than a father. With admiring eyes he looked on McCrae's fine face,
his broad shoulders, his wonderful physique, and the question he asked sprang from his lips
before he could arrest it.

"Why don't you get married, Mac?"

"Who, me?" said McCrae, laughing; but Harris detected a tone in his voice that was not all
happiness, and the thought came to him that McCrae's craving for hospitality might root deeper
than he supposed.

"It's a long ride to the land office," continued McCrae, "an' you can't file a minute too soon.
We'd better find a corner post an? make sure of the number of this section, an' put as much
road behind us as we can tonight."

CHAPTER IV

ROUGHING IT

After filing at the land office Harris returned at once to the Arthurses' homestead. The news
that the Harrises were to be neighbours within forty miles was received with enthusiasm by
both Fred and Lilian Arthurs. But Harris was now consumed with a burning energy; he allowed
himself only a precious half-day at the home of the Arthurses, bade his wife an affectionate
farewell, and, with a cheery good-bye to the warm friends on the homestead, he was away down
the trail to Emerson. By this time the sleighing was gone, and as his wagon was left with the
car he rode one horse and led the other, carrying with him harness and such equipment as was
absolutely necessary on the road. He expected some trouble from the streams, which were now
breaking up in earnest, but he was determined that at all costs he would get his wagon, plough,
and tools to the homestead before the frost came out of the ground and left the sod trails
absolutely impassable.

On arrival at Emerson one of the first men he met was Tom Morrison. The two pioneers shook
hands warmly, and in a few words Harris told of having selected his claim, waxing enthusiastic
over the locality in which his lot was to be cast.

"I must get out there myself," said Morrison.

"Do," Harris urged. "There are some other line quarters in the neighbourhood, and nothing would
be better than to have you on one of them."

"Well, we'll see. Now, I've got your wagon loaded ready for the road. I couldn't get all your
stuff on, but I loaded what you'll want first, and the balance can come with the rest of mine,
so you won't have to make another trip. Ned has been back for some days, and we're ready to
pull out too. And the sooner the better. The river is risin' real dangerous like, and if it
keeps on this town's goin' to be under water before it knows it. Indeed, it wouldn't surprise
me if the bridge went out. So we took the rest of the stuff--yours and mine--out a day's haul
on the road. It's in safe hands there, and we can get it later even if the bridge does go.
We thought we might as well do that while waitin' for you."

"Waiting for me?" repeated Harris. "You don't mean to say you have stayed here just on my account?"

"Oh, no; you see, we wanted to get all the stuff out of danger."

But Harris read between the words that honest Tom had valued his interests equally with his own.

The west-bound trip was made in good time, although not without difficulty at some points in
the road, and before the 10th of April Harris was back under the shelter of Arthurs' roof.
He was for pressing on alone in the morning, but he found that his wife had made all her plans
to accompany him and would listen neither to persuasion nor reason.

"No, Jack," she said, gently but firmly setting all his entreaties aside. "I'm not going to
let you do all the pioneering. I'm going with you."

"But, Mary, there's no house, and no shelter, and no neighbours--nothing but sky and grass
as far as you can see."

"All the more reason I should go," she answered. "If you have to rough it in the open you at
least deserve your meals cooked for you, and such other help as a woman can give. We will take
the cows--one of them is milking now; the calf will have to go in the wagon; but we'll have
lots of milk, and I'm sure we'll get along. But I really must be with you. I really must, John,
and you know--I'm going."

So at last he consented. The supplies of provisions were increased; room for the calf was found
somewhere in the wagon, and together they set out to wrestle their fortunes from the wilderness.

On arrival at the homestead the young wife immediately gave evidence that she intended to bear
her full share of the pioneer's duties. A comparatively dry spot was found among the little
poplars, and here she built a tent with blankets and a bit of rag-carpet that came in most
handy for such purposes. Their stove was set up, and although it smoked stubbornly for lack
of draught, it furnished heat for cooking, and when Jack returned from tethering the horses
the smell of frying ham and hot tea struck his nostrils.

"Well, that's better than rustling for myself, I will admit," he said, as she placed his supper
on an improvised table. "But it's mighty rough on you."

"No, it isn't, either. I'm healthy--why, this prairie air gives me an appetite that city people
would pay thousands for, and I'm strong--and happy."

He drew her to him, thrilled with the pride of her courage.

That night, before the darkness had gathered too deep, they selected the site of their house
on the very bench that McCrae had indicated. It was about an acre in extent, and stood halfway
between the prairie level and the bottom of the coulee, where a small river was now running...They
would face their house eastward, so it would look over the pond fifty yards from the door,
and the bank behind would shelter it from the north-west winds of winter...It was quite dark
when they sought the cover of their little tent, and the wolves were howling far down the ravine.

Presently they were startled by a crashing noise, as of some big animals rushing upon them
through the poplars, and the horses, in headlong haste, almost swept over their sleeping-place.
On recognizing their master the animals stood, snorting and shivering.

"That wolf howl put the fear into the silly brutes," said Harris, speaking calmly, although
his own flesh was creeping just a little. "I suppose they've ripped their tether ropes to pieces.
Well, we'll tie them down here, where they'll have company." And he led them back a short distance
into the bushes.

A moment later, suddenly, as if congealed out of thin air, on the bank right above them, silhouetted
against the dim light in the western sky, stood a horse and rider. Instantly into Harris's
mind came a warning of McCrae: "Sleep with one eye open when your horses are tethered out."

Harris had no proof that the strange rider was a horse thief, but it struck him at the moment
that the terror of the horses might not have been due altogether to wolves. Sometimes these
noble animals have an uncanny instinct for detecting danger. He stole silently toward the tent.
There was a gun there, loaded with shot for any possible game on the prairie. As he moved in
the deep darkness of the valley he stumbled over a root and fell. The same moment came a flash
of light on the bank, and Harris heard the "thuk" of a ball burying itself in the sod. He lay
perfectly still. The stranger peered into the darkness for a full minute; then, dismounting,
began to come cautiously down the hillside. Harris would have rushed for his gun, but he feared
to reveal the whereabouts of his wife. So he lay still, and the stranger came on, the glint
of his gun-barrel showing in the darkness. It was evident he thought his bullet had found its
mark, and he proposed still to possess himself of the horses. But he was taking no chances.
Presently he discerned Harris's body on the ground, and again raised his gun to his shoulder.
Harris lay in an agony of suspense, praying that the aim would be faulty, and that his assailant
would advance until he could spring up and disarm him. Then came another flash, a loud report,
a yell from the intruder, who half fell to earth, then scrambled to his feet, rushed up the
bank, pulled himself somewhat limply on his horse, and rode into the darkness.

"Oh, Jack, are you killed?" cried the girl, rushing in his direction.

"Not even hurt," he answered; and she fainted in his arms.

He carried her to the tent and applied water to her forehead. As he was engaged in restoring
her his hand fell on his gun. The barrel was hot.

He raised her face to his, and kissed her again and again.

In the morning they found a few drops of blood on the grass at the top of the bank.

Harris and his wife allowed themselves no time for nerve-strain over the experience of their
first night on their homestead. It was fortunate for them there was so much to do, and that
they were thrown entirely upon their own resources. Their little store of money was running
very low, and they decided their house must be of the cheapest possible construction. Harris
had already discussed his buildings with McCrae, who advised him to make use of sods, and gave
general directions how to do so; and he now set about to put McCrae's suggestions into effect.
Some fifteen miles north of the homestead was a valley in which grew trees of sufficient size
for building purposes--poplars, cottonwoods, elms, and oaks. Farther down the valley, at the
head of a lake, was a saw-mill, where boards and shingles might be bought--if one had money.

So this morning, after caring for their cows, they hitched the horses to the wagon, took an
axe, a saw, their gun, and a lunch, and set out for the valley, returning late at night with
sufficient logs and poles for the framework of their house and stable. The next day construction
was commenced. Four stout posts were set on end, enclosing a rectangle twelve by sixteen feet.
The tops of the posts were connected by logs laid upon them, dovetailed at the corners after
the fashion of woodsmen, and held in position by wooden pins driven in auger-holes. Lengthwise
along the centre, to form a ridgepole, another stout log was laid and the whole framework supported
by additional posts, among which were two on the east side to enclose the door. Small poles
were then placed on end, sloping slightly inwards, and resting against the plate-logs. Similar
poles were laid from the plate-logs to the ridge-pole to support the roof.

Harris found a southern slope where the frost was out enough to admit of him ploughing some
sods. He knew he would not get as good a sod here as later in the season might be found in
some low-lying spot, but his first consideration was to get some kind of permanent shelter.
So he ploughed the sods, three inches thick and fourteen inches wide, and cut them into two-foot
lengths with his axe, to the sad injury of its cutting edge. These sods were then built into
a wall like bricks, resting gently against the framework of poles, from which, however, they
were separated by a padding of grass, which Harris cut in a sleugh with his scythe, and small
willows from the ravine. This mattress of grass and willows prevented any earth shaking through
into the house itself. A framework made of a hewn log was inserted in the south wall to leave
space for a window, which should be bought when the family finances could afford such luxuries.
For the time being it would be left open in fine weather and covered with canvas when the elements
were gruff or unruly. The rag-carpet, when no longer needed as a tent, would be draped in the
doorway, pending the purchase of boards to make a wooden door.

For a roof grass was laid on the poles and covered tightly with sods. Then Harris found a sticky,
yellow clay in the side of the ravine, and two or three inches of this he spread carefully
over the sods, like icing on a great cake. The greasy clay soon hardened in the sun, and became
so impervious to water that the heaviest rains of summer made no impression upon it.

When, save for the missing door and window, the house was finished, they stood in the centre
and admired. It was absolutely the product of their own labour, applied to such scanty resources
as the prairie provided. But it was warm and snug, and, as they later on learned, the wall
and roof of sod were almost perfect non-conductors of either heat or cold. The floor was of
earth, but Mary Harris knew the difference between earth and dirt, although the words are frequently
confounded, and her house was from the first a model of cleanliness and order.

By this time the snow was all gone, except in north-facing nooks along the ravine, and the
frost was out of the sod in all places deep enough to admit of plouging. As the stock were
taking no harm from the open air, thanks to the shelter of the ravine, Harris decided to delay
the construction of his stable until after seeding and to proceed at once with the ploughing
of his land. He had also to make a trip to Arthurs' for seed grain, and to borrow a couple
of sections of drag harrows. With it all, by the middle of May he had sown fifteen acres of
wheat, and notwithstanding a heavy snowfall about the 23rd, by the 1st of June he had added
ten acres of oats. With his help Mary had planted a small garden of potatoes and vegetables,
and a few flowers were springing up at the door of the house.

It was a life of hard, persistent work--of loneliness, privation, and hardship. But it was
also a life of courage, of health, of resourcefulness, of a wild, exhilarating freedom found
only in God's open spaces. They had learned to know the animals of the field--the cheeky gopher;
the silent, over-industrious badger; the skunk, unchallenged monarch of his immediate circle;
the sneaky coyote, whose terror is all in his howl; the red fox, softly searching amid the
grass for the nests of ducks or prairie chicken; and the rabbit, curious but always gracefully
elusive. Then there were the waterfowl, infinite in number. The stuffed ducks on the dinner-table
were limited only by the amount of powder and shot which Harris cared to spend on the pond
at their door. At night, when the horses had been unharnessed and dusk was setting in, he would
slip his gun under his arm and walk down among the willows. It was necessary only to wait.
Two graceful forms, feeding under a grassy bank, hearing a slight rustle above, would shove
with quick, silent stroke into the supposed safety of their native element. Harris would peer
through the dusk for the brighter markings of the male, for only a game-murderer shoots the
female in the nesting season. Then, as they separated a little, his gun would speak; a sudden
splashing of water; a sharp whistle of rapid wings cutting the air; a form, paddling an uncertain
circle in the pond, then lying strangely flat upon the surface. Harris as yet had no dog, and
often it meant stripping and a sharp plunge in the ice-cold water to bring in the trophy; but
the strong, athletic young man counted that only part of the sport. At other times the nights
were clamorous with the honking of wild geese, and in the morning Harris, slipping quietly
over the bank of the coulee, would see the prairie white as from new-fallen snow with the backs
of countless thousands of "wavies." Sometimes the geese, secure in the supposedly unsettled
wilderness, relaxed the vigour of their military guard, and on such occasions he could get
within range. But if there is one quality the goose lacks it is that which is most attributed
to him--foolishness. On his marches through the unmapped desert of the air he moves with the
precision of an army in the field, scouting out all the land, taking aerial observations before
making camp, and immediately throwing out sentries around his feeding ground. But long-continued
immunity from attack breeds carelessness, even in a goose, and the price of such neglect frequently
adorned the table in Harris's cabin.

The prairie flowers, too, were a never-ending delight to the heart of the young woman. She
knew some of them by name, but many were peculiar to the prairie. The first few warm days of
spring had clothed all the wilderness with a magic carpet of pale-purplish blossoms, and the
advancing season brought new blooms to view with every passing week. On Sundays, when there
was total relaxation from their regular labours, the two, arm in arm, would stroll along the
bank of the ravine, or walk, ankle-deep in strawberry blossoms, far over the undulating plain
to the west. Returning, they would find their way to the edge of the stream, where, in the
shallow crossing, the suckers would dart in all directions in panic at their appearance. Here
they would sit and listen to the gentle murmur of the water, while fleecy clouds mirrored themselves
in its glassy depths, and plovers ran whistling up and down the bank, and a meadow-lark sent
its limpid challenge from a neighbouring bush. And at night, when the moon rose in wonderful
whiteness and purity, wrapping field and ravine in a riot of silver, the strange, irresistible,
unanswerable longing of the great plains stole down upon them, and they knew that here indeed
was life in its fulness--a participation in the Infinite, indefinable, but all-embracing, everlasting.

CHAPTER V

THE SHORES OF THE INFINITE

The summer was a season of great activity and development. Harris did not sow any crop after
the 1st of June, but applied himself then to the construction of his stable, which was built
after the same fashion as the house. The shelter of its cool walls and roof was gratefully
sought by the cows in the heat of the day, and its comparative freedom from mosquitoes was
a haven to the horses in the evenings. Then there was more land to plough, and Harris's soul
never dulled to the delight of driving the ploughshare through the virgin sod. There was something
almost sacred in the bringing of his will to bear upon soil which had come down to him through
all the ages fresh from the hand of the Creator. The blackbirds that followed at his heel in
long, respectful rows, solemnly seeking the trophies of their chase, might have been incarnations
from the unrecorded ages that had known these broad fields for chase and slaughter, but never
for growth and production. The era of the near vision, demanding its immediate reward, had
passed away, and in its place was the day of faith, for without faith there can be neither
seed-time nor harvest.

But it was not only on Harris's homestead that development was taking place. As McCrae had
predicted, there was a considerable movement of settlers into the district, and at several
points their tents or rude houses now broke the vast sweep of the horizon. Tom Morrison had
found land to the satisfaction of his heart within three miles of the Harris homestead, and
his big log-house, eighteen by twenty-four, assumed the proportions of a castle by comparison
with the smaller homes springing up around. Some miles to the east Dick Matheson, straight
from the lumber camps of the Madawaski, had pitched his tent, and a few miles farther on was
his friend of the shanties, John Burton. To the west were the Grants, and to the north Hiram
Riles and his wife, Eliza. A mixed community they were, drawn from many corners, and all of
them more or less under the heel of poverty; but they were filled with enthusiasm, with resourcefulness,
and an indomitable determination to face and overcome all obstacles. A missionary had in some
way spied out the field, and held monthly Sunday services at Morrison's house; and Dr. Blain,
when not in one of his unfortunate debauches, had his headquarters at the new town of Plainville,
which consisted of Sempter's general store and a "stopping-place," and which had sprung up
near the junction of two streams in anticipation of the railway.

None of these pioneers was possessed of a complete farming equipment, but each had something
which his neighbour lacked, and they made common cause together in their struggle with Nature.
Thus Harris had no mower, but when haying season came he was able to borrow Morrison's, at
the same time lending his plough to Riles, who simultaneously accommodated Morrison with his
hayrack. Among the women exchanging became something of an exact science. Mrs. Grant was the
proud possessor of a very modern labour-saver in the shape of a clothes-wringer, as a consequence
of which wash-day was rotated throughout the community, and it was well known that Mrs. Riles
and Mrs. Harris had to do their churning alternately. But it was Mrs. Morrison's sewing-machine
that was the great boon to the community, and to it, perhaps, as much as the open-hearted hospitality
of honest Tom and his wife, was due the fact that their house became the social centre of the
district.

Nor was the settlement deprived of its share of sport and amusement. On one of his periodical
visits McCrae donated a baseball, and Harris quickly shaped a bat from the trunk of a stout
willow he found by the river-bed. They had all outdoors to play in, and it was a simple matter
to mow the grass from a stretch of level prairie and turn over the sod at points to mark the
bases. Unfortunately, there were not enough men in the community to make two baseball teams,
but a species of game was devised in which the players batted in turn, and when not batting
or base-running were always on the "out" side. Harris developed considerable ability as a pitcher,
throwing the powerful straight ball which in those days was a greater menace to the bare hands
of the catcher than to the batter at the plate. On the occasion of his monthly visits the missionary,
who was an ardent ball-player, generally contrived to reach Morrison's by Saturday afternoon,
and so was able to take part in the Saturday night game. And although he never took advantage
of his association with the young men to "preach" to them, except on Sundays, a sense of comradeship
sprang up, and a standard of sport was established which bore fruit in the community many years
later.

And so the first summer wore away and the first harvest was at hand. Any disappointment which
had been occasioned by backward conditions earlier in the season was effaced by the wonderful
crop which now crowned the efforts of the pioneers. What is your comment?

Come on, Harris, hand it over. I got t' have it, or I can't make the grade."

"Well, you'll make the grade first to-night," said Harris.

After that the doctor remained silent for some time. Then suddenly he demanded: "Shay, Harris,
where you takin' me to, anyway?"

"I'm taking you home."

"Home? What home? I got no home, jus'a--"

"I'm taking you to my home."

"Wha' for? You're all right, I guess..." Suddenly the doctor stood erect. "Harris, is your
wife sick?"

"That's why I came for you."

"Well, why the devil didn't you say so? Here, give me that whip. Harris, Harris, what did you
waste time arguing for?"

"I didn't waste much. The argument was mostly on your side."

"Harris," said the doctor, after a long silence, "you think I'm a fool. You're right. It isn't
as though I didn't know. I know the road I'm going, and the end thereof... And yet, in a pinch,
I can pull myself together. I'm all right now. But it'll get me again as soon as this is over...
Any good I am, any good I do, is just a bit of salvage out of the wreck. The wreck--yes, it's

***

Just as the dawn was breaking he knelt beside her. Her eyes were very large and quiet, and
her face was white and still. But she raised one pale hand, and the thin fingers fondled in
his hair. She drew his face very gently down, and big silent tears stood in his eyes.

"We will call him Allan," he said.

CHAPTER VI

IN THE SPELL OF THE MIRAGE

A quarter of a century is a short time as world history goes, but it is a considerable era
in the life of the Canadian West. More things--momentous things--than can be hinted at in this
narrative occurred in the twenty-five years following the great inrush of 1882. The boundless
prairie reaches of Manitoba were now comparatively well settled, and the tide of immigration,
which, after a dozen years' stagnation, had set in again in greater flood than ever, was now
sweeping over the newer lands still farther west. Railways had supplanted ox-cart and bob-sleigh
as the freighters of the plains; the farmer read his daily paper on the porch after supper,
while his sons and daughters drove to town in "top" buggies, tailor-made suits, and patent-leather
shoes. The howl of the coyote had given way to the whistle of the locomotive; beside the sod
hut of earlier days rose the frame or brick house proclaiming prosperity or social ambition.
The vast sweep of the horizon, once undefiled by any work of man, was pierced and broken with
elevators, villages, and farm buildings, and the whiff of coal smoke was blown down the air
which had so lately known only the breath of the prairies. The wild goose no longer loitered
in the brown fields in spring and autumn, and the wild duck had sought the safety of the little
lakes. The pioneer days had passed away, and civilization and prosperity were rampant in the
land. There were those, too, who thought that perhaps the country had lost something in all
its gaining; that perhaps there was less idealism and less unreckoning hospitality in the brick
house on the hill than there once had been in the sod shack In the hollow.

Mary Harris hurried about her capacious kitchen, deep in the preparation of the evening meal.
The years had taken toll of the freshness of her young beauty; the shoulders, in mute testimony
to much hard labour of the hands, had drooped forward over the deepening chest; the hair was
thinner, and farther back above the forehead, and streaked with grey at the temples; the mouth
lacked the rosy sensuousness of youth, and sat now in a mould, half of resolution, half submission.
Yet her foot had lost little of its sprightliness, and the sympathy in her fine eyes seemed
to have deepened with the years.

A moist but appetizing steam rose from the vegetable pots on the range, and when she threw
back the iron door to feed more coal the hot glow from within danced a reflection along the
bright row of utensils hanging from the wall, and even sought out the brass plate on the cream
separator at the far end of the big room. Through the screen door came the monotonously redundant
clic...a...clank of the windmill, and a keen ear might have caught the light splash of water
as it fell in the wooden horse-troughs from the iron nozzle of the pump.

Mary stuck a fork in a potato to ascertain if the "bone" was all gone, meanwhile shielding
her face from the steam with the pot lid, held aloft in an aproned hand. Having satisfied herself
that the meal was making satisfactory progress, she stepped to the door and sent a quick look
across the fields, to where a streak of black smoke was scrawled along the sky.

"Beulah," she called, turning toward the interior part of the house. "Come, Beulah, set the
table. They're coming from the field."

In a moment a girl of twenty, plainly attired in a neat calico dress, entered the kitchen.
She was fresh and beautiful as her mother had been that first summer in the sod house on the
bench, and something in her appearance suggested that with her mother's beauty and fine sensibility
she had inherited the indomitable spirit which had made John Harris one of the must prosperous
farmers in the district. She moved in an easy, unconscious grace of self-reliance--a reliance
that must be just a little irritating to men of old-fashioned notions concerning woman's dependence
on the sterner sex--drew the long wooden table, with its covering of white oilcloth, into the
centre of the kitchen, and began placing the dishes in position.

"I don't see why we can't have supper in the dining-room," she protested at length. "Before
we built the new house we were always talking about how fine it would be to have a separate
room, for our meals, and now we don't eat in it once a week."

"I know," said the mother, in a quiet, tired voice. "But you know what your father thinks about
it. You know how down he is on style."

"It's no great style to eat in a dining-room," continued the girl. "What did he build it for?
To take off his boots in? That's about all he does there, nights before he goes to bed."

"Now, Beulah, don't be unreasonable. You know we always have meals there Sundays. But your
father likes the kitchen best when it ain't too hot. And besides, I can hardly take them into
the dining-room while the ploughing's on. You know how greasy they are with the engine."

"They're ploughing over at Grant's, too, and when I dropped in there yesterday the dinner was
set in the dining-room, and a clean white linen cloth on the table, and napkins set for the
men, and I guess they use the same kind of grease as we do," persisted the girl. "And I noticed
when they came in to dinner Mr. Grant and the boys, and the hired man too, all put their coats
on--not their working coats, but coats they had hanging in a closet handy. It didn't take a
minute, but it looked different."

"Now, Beulah, you know your father would never stand for putting on airs like that. He--"

"'Tisn't putting on airs. It's putting on clothes--clean clothes to eat in. Susy Grant never
has to feel--I hate to say it, Mother--ashamed if any of her friends drop in at mealtime. And
I couldn't help thinking how fine Harry looked--"

"'Pon my word, Beulah, I'm beginning to think you must be a bit soft on Harry Grant. I had
thought perhaps your weakness was toward Jim, but perhaps I'm mistaken."

"Can't a girl say a fellow's fine-looking without being soft about it?" she continued. "As
for Jim--"

But at this moment the conversation was cut short by the scraping of heavy boots on the ploughshare
nailed to the block at the door, and John Harris, followed by Allan and the hired man, Jim,
walked into the kitchen. The farmer's frame was heavier than in his younger days, and his hair,
too, was streaked with grey, but every muscle in his great body seemed to bulge with strength.
His face was brown with the prairie sun and wind of twenty-five summers, and lines of worry
and care had cut their tracings about the mouth and eyes. Beside him stood Allan, his only
son, straighter and lither of figure, but almost equally powerful. The younger man was, indeed,
a replica of the older, and although they had their disagreements, constant association had
developed a fine comradeship, and, on the part of the son, a loyalty equal to any strain. The
hired man, Jim, was lighter and finer of feature, and his white teeth gleamed against the nut-brown
of his face in a quiet smile that refused to be displaced in any emergency, and at times left
the beholder in considerable doubt as to the real emotions working behind.

The men all wore blue overalls, dark blue or grey shirts, and heavy boots. They were guiltless
of coat or vest, and tossed their light straw hats on the water-bench as they passed. There
was a quick splashing of greasy hands at the wash-basin, followed by a more effectual rubbing
on a towel made from a worn-out grain sack. The hired man paused to change the water and wash
his face, but the others proceeded at once to the table, where no time was lost in ceremony.
Meat, potatoes, and boiled cabbage were supplied in generous quantities on large platters.
A fine stack of white bread tiered high on a plate, and a mountainous pile of Mary Harris's
famous fresh buns towered on another. All hands ate at the table together, although the hired
man was usually last to sit down, owing to his perverse insistence upon washing his face and
combing his hair before each meal. Although his loss of time sometimes irritated Harris, he
bore it in silence. There was no better farm hand in the country-side than Jim Travers, and,
as Harris often remarked, employers nowadays couldn't afford to be too particular about trifles.

Harris helped himself generously to meat and vegetables and, having done so, passed the platters
to his son, and in this way they were circulated about the table. Mary poured the tea from
a big granite pot at her elbow, and whenever a shortage of food threatened Beulah rose from
her place and refilled plate or platter. There was no talk for the first few minutes, only
the sound of knife and fork plied vigorously and interchangeably by father and son, and with
some regard for convention by the other members of the family. John Harris had long ago recognized
the truth that the destiny of food was the mouth, and whether conveyed on knife or fork made
little difference. Mary, too, had found a carelessness of little details both of manner and
speech coming over her, as her occasional "ain't" betrayed, but since Jim had joined their
table she had been on her guard. Jim seldom said anything, but always that quiet smile lay
like a mask over his real emotions.

When the first insistent demands of appetite had been appeased, Harris, resting both elbows
on the table, with knife and fork trained on opposite corners of the ceiling, straightened
himself somewhat and remarked:

"Allan an' me's goin' to town to-night; anything you want from Sempter's store, Mary?"

"That lets me in for the cows," said Beulah. "You were in town night before last, too, and
it was half-past nine before I got through milking."

"Oh, well, Jim was away that night," said Allan.

"Jim has enough to do, without milking cows after hours," returned the girl. "What do you want
to go to town for again to-night, anyway?"

"Got to get more coal," said Harris. "We'll take two teams, an' it'll be late when we get back."

"Try and not be too late," said the mother, quietly. "You have to be at work so early in the
morning, you know."

"I think it's all nonsense, this day-an'-night work," persisted Beulah. "Is there never going
to be any let-up to it?"

"Beulah, you forget yourself," said her father, "If you'd more to do you'd have less lime to
fret about it. Your mother did more work in one summer than you have in all your life, an'
she's doin' more yet."

"Oh, Beulah's a good help," interposed Mary. "I hope she never has to work like I did."

"I guess the work never hurt us," said Harris, helping himself to preserved strawberries. "Just
the same, I'm glad to see you gettin' it a bit easier. But this younger generation--it beats
me what we're comin' to. Thinkin' about nothin' but fun and gaddin' to town every night or
two. And clo'es--Beulah here's got more clo'es than there were in the whole Plainville settlement
the first two or three years."

"I got more neighbours, too," interjected the girl. Then springing up, she stood behind her
father's chair and put her arm around his neck.

"Don't be cross, Dad," she whispered. "Your heart's in the right place--but a long way in."

He disengaged her, gently enough. As Beulah said, his heart was all right, but a long way in.
Twenty-five years of pitched battle with circumstances--sometimes in victory, sometimes in
defeat, but never in despair; always with a load of expense about him, always with the problem
of income and outlay to be solved--had made of Harris a man very different from the young idealist
of '82. During the first years of struggle for a bare existence in some way the flame of idealism
still burned, but with the dawn of the "better times" there came a gradual shifting of standards
and a new conception of essentials. At first the settlers attached little value to their land;
it was free for the taking, and excited no envy among them. The crops of the early years were
unprofitable on account of the great distance to market; later, when the railway came to their
doors, the crops were still unprofitable, owing to falling prices and diminishing yields due
to poor cultivation. Then came a decade during which those who stayed in the country stayed
because they could not get out, and it became a current saying that the more land a man farmed
the deeper he got in debt. Homesteads were abandoned; settlers flew by night "across the line"
or to more distant districts to begin their fight over again. And yet, in some way, Harris
kept his idealism amid all the adversity in which the community was steeped; reverses could
neither crush his spirit nor deflect it from its ambitions.

Then came the swing of the pendulum. No one knows just what started it prosperity-wards. Some
said it was that the farmers, disheartened with wheat-growing, were applying themselves to
stock, and certain it is that in "mixed farming" the community eventually found its salvation;
others attributed the change to improved agricultural implements, to improved methods of farming,
to greater knowledge of prairie conditions, to reductions in the cost of transportation and
enlarged facilities for marketing, or to increasing world demand and higher world prices for
the product of the farm. But whatever the causes--and no doubt all of the above contributed--the
fact gradually dawned upon the settlers that land--their land--was worth money.

It was the farmers from the United States, scouting for cheaper lands than were available in
their own communities, who first drove the conviction home. They came with money in their wallets;
they were actually prepared to exchange real money for land. Such a thing had never before
been heard of in Plainville district. At first the settlers were sceptical. Here were two facts
almost beyond the grasp of their imagination: that farmers should buy land with money, and
the farmers should have money with which to buy land. True, a few of them had already bought
railway lands at three or four dollars an acre, but they bought oil long terms, with a trifling
investment, and they aimed to pay for the lands out of the crops or not at all.

But a few transactions took place; lands were sold at five dollars, six dollars, eight dollars
an acre. The farmers began to realize that land represented wealth--that it was an asset, not
a liability--and there was a rush for the cheap railway lands that had so long gone a-begging.
Harris was among the first to sense the change in the times, and a beautiful section of railway
land that lay next to his homestead he bought at four dollars an acre. The first crop more
than paid for the land, and Harris suddenly found himself on the way to riches.

The joy that came with the realization that fortune had knocked at his door and he had heard
was the controlling emotion of his heart for a year or more. But gradually, like a fog blown
across a moonlit night, came a sense of chill and disappointment. If only he had bought two
sections! If at least he had proved up on his pre-emption, which he might have had for nothing!
He saw neighbours about him adding quarter to quarter. None of them had done better than himself,
but some had done as well. And in some way the old sense of oneness, the old community interest
which had held the little band of pioneers together amid their privations and their poverty,
began to weaken and dissolve, and in its place came an individualism and a materialism that
measured progress only in dollars and cents. Harris did not know that his gods had fallen,
that his ideals had been swept away; even as he sat at supper this summer evening, with his
daughter's arms about his neck, he felt that he was still bravely, persistently, pressing on
toward the goal, all unaware that years ago he had left that goal like a lighthouse on a rocky
shore, and was now sweeping along with the turbulent tide of Mammonism. He still saw the light
ahead, but it was now a phantom of the imagination. He said, "When I am worth ten thousand
I will have reached it"; when he was worth ten thousand he found the faithless light had moved
on to twenty-five thousand. He said, "When I am worth twenty-five thousand I will have reached
it"; when he was worth twenty-five thousand he saw the glow still ahead, beckoning him on to
fifty thousand. It never occurred to him to slacken his pace--to allow his mind a rest from
its concentration; if he had paused and looked about he might, even yet, have recognized the
distant lighthouse on the reef about the wreck of his ideals. But to stop now might mean losing
sight of his goal, and John Harris held nothing in heaven or earth so great as its attainment.

So, gently enough, he disengaged his daughter's arms and finished his supper in silence. As
soon as it was ended the men started for the barn, and in a few minutes two wagons rattled
noisily down the trail.

Beulah helped with the supper dishes, and then came out with the milk-pails to the corral where
the cows, puffing and chewing, complacently awaited her arrival. But she had not reached the
gate when the hired man was at her side and had slipped one of the pails from her arm.

"Now, Jim, I don't think that's fair at all," she said; and there was a tremor in her voice
that vexed her. "Here you're slaving all day with coal and water, and I think that's enough,
without milking cows at night."

But Jim only smiled and stirred a cow into position.

"Yes, that's like you," she continued. "Pick Daisie first, just because you know she's tough
as rubber. Say, Jim, honest goods," she demanded, pausing and facing him, milk stool in hand,
"why do you let father put this kind of stuff over on you?"

"Your father doesn't put anything over on me," he answered. "I'm very fond of milking."

"Yes, you are--not," she said. "You do it on my account, because you're too big-hearted to
quit before I'm through..." There was a tuneful song of the tin pails as the white streams
rattled on their bottoms.

"Jim," she said, after a while, when the noise of the milking was drowned in the creamy froth,
"I'm getting near the end of this kind of thing. Father's getting more and more set on money
all the time. He thinks I should slave along too to pile up more beside what he's got already,
but I'm not going to do it much longer. Mother stands it--I guess she's got used to him, and
she won't say anything, but if there's anything I'm not strong on it's silence. I'm not afraid
of work, or hardship either. I'd live in a sack if I had to. I'd--"

"Would you live in a shack?" said Jim.

She shot a quick look at him. But he was quietly smiling into his milk-pail, and she decided
to treat his question impersonally.

"Yes, I'd live in a shack, too, if I had to. I put in my first years in a sod-house, and there
was more real happiness romping up and down the land then than there is now. In those days
everybody was so poor that money didn't count...It's different now."

Jim did not pursue the subject, and the milking was completed in silence. Jim finished first,
and presently the rising hum of the cream separator was heard from the kitchen.

"There he goes, winding his arm off--for me," said the girl, as she rose from the last cow.
"Poor Jim--I wish I knew whether it's just human kindness makes him do it, or whether--" She
stopped, colouring a little over the thought that had almost escaped into words.

When the heavy grind of the separating was finished Jim went quietly to his own room, but the
girl put on a clean dress and walked out through the garden. Rows of mignonette and lobelia
bordered the footpath, and sweet, earthy garden smells filled the calm evening air. The rows
of currant and gooseberry bushes were heavy with green fruit; the leaves of the Manitoba maples
trembled ever so little in the still air. The sun was setting, and fleecy fragments of cloud
were painted ruddy gold against the silver background of the sky. From the barnyard came the
contented sighing of the cows and the anxious clucking of a hen gathering in her belated brood.
The whole country seemed bathed in peace--a peace deep and unpurchasable, having no part in
any of the affairs of man.

At the lower gate she stooped to pick a flower, which she held for a moment to her face; then,
toying lightly with it in her fingers, she slipped the latch and continued along the path leading
down into the ravine. It was dark and cool down there, with a touch of dampness in the grass,
and the balm-of-Gileads across the stream sent a fine moist fragrance through the air. To the
right lay the bench where the sod-house had stood, not so much as a mound now marking the spot;
but the thoughts of the girl turned yearningly to it, and to the days of the lonely but not
unhappy childhood which it had sheltered.

Presently she reached the water, and her quick ear caught the sound of a musk-rat slipping
gently into the stream from the reeds on the opposite bank; she could see the widening wake
where he ploughed his swift way across the pond. Then her own figure stood up before her, graceful
and lithe as the willows on the bank. She surveyed it a minute, then flicked the flower at
her face in the water, and turned slowly homeward. She was not unhappy, but a dull sense of
loss oppressed her--a sense that the world was very rich and very beautiful, and that she was
feasting neither on its richness nor its beauty. There was a stirring of music and poetry in
her soul, but neither music nor poetry found expression. What she felt was a consciousness
that great things were just beyond the horizon of her experience, things undefined and undefinable
which, could she but grasp them, would deepen life and sweeten life and give a purpose to all
her being. And as she walked up the path and the fragrant night air filled her nostrils, something
of that wilder life seemed borne in upon her and sent a fresh spring to her ankle. And presently
she discovered she was thinking about Jim Travers.

Her mother sat in the dining-room, knitting by the light of the hanging lamp. Her face seemed
very pale and lovely in the soft glow.

"Don't you think you have done enough?" said the girl, slipping into a sitting posture on the
floor by her mother's knee. "You work, work, work, all the time. I suppose they'll have to
let you work in heaven."

"We value our work more as we grow older," said the mother..."It helps to keep us from thinking."

"There you go!" exclaimed the girl; but there was a tenderness in her voice. "Worrying again.
I wish they'd stay home for a change."

The mother plied her needles in silence. "Slip away to bed, Beulah," she said at length. "I
will wait up for a while."

Late in the night the girl heard heavy footsteps in the kitchen and bursts of loud but indistinct
talking.

CHAPTER VII

THE CALL OF THE FARTHER WEST

Notwithstanding Harris's late hours the household was early astir the following morning. At
five o'clock Jim was at work in the stables, feeding, rubbing down, and harnessing his horses,
while Allan and his father walked to the engine, where they built a fresh fire and made some
minor repairs. Even at this early hour the sun shone brightly, its rays mellowing in a sheen
of ground-mist that enveloped the prairie, but there is a tang in the Manitoba morning air
even in midsummer, and the men walked briskly through the crisp stubble. A little later Beulah
came down to the corral with her milk-pails, and the cows, comfortably chewing where they rested
on their warm spots of earth, rose slowly and with evident great reluctance at her approach.
A spar of light blue smoke ascended in a perpendicular column from the kitchen chimney; motherly
hens led their broods forth to forage; pigs grunted with rising enthusiasm from near-by pens,
and calves voiced insistent demands from their quarters. The Harris farm, like fifty thousand
others, rose from its brief hush of rest and quiet to the sounds and energies of another day.

Breakfast, like the meal of the night before, was eaten hurriedly, and at first without conversation,
but at length Harris paused long enough to remark, "Riles is talkin' o' goin' West."

"The news might be worse," said Beulah. Riles, although a successful farmer, had the reputation
of being grasping and hard to a degree, even in a community where such qualities, in moderation,
were by no means considered vices.

Harris paid no attention to his daughter's interruption. It was evident, however, that his
mention of Riles had a purpose behind it, and presently he continued:

"Riles has been writin' to the Department of the Interior, and it seems they're openin' a lot
of land for homesteadin' away West, not far from the Rocky Mountains. Seems they have a good
climate there, and good soil, too."

"I should think Mr. Riles would be content with what he has," said Mary Harris. "He has a fine
farm here, and I'm sure both him and his wife have worked hard enough to take it easier now."

"Hard work never killed nobody," pursued the farmer. "Riles is good for many a year yet, and
free land ain't what it once was. Those homesteads'll be worth twenty dollars an acre by the
time they're proved up."

"I wish I was sure of it--I wouldn't think long," said Allan. "But they say it's awful dry;
all right for ranchin', but no good for farmin'."

"Who says that?" demanded his father. "The ranchers. They know which side their bread's buttered
on. As long's they can get grazin' land for two cents an acre, or maybe nothin', of course
they don't want the homesteader. They tell me the Englishmen and Frenchmen that went out into
that country when us Canadians settled in Manitoba have more cattle now than they can count--they
measure 'em by acres, Riles says."

Breakfast and Harris's speech came to an end simultaneously, and the subject was dropped for
the time. In a few minutes Jim had his team hitched to the tank wagon in the yard. The men
jumped aboard, and the wagon rattled down the road to where the engine and ploughs sat in the
stubble-field.

"What notion's this father's got about Riles, do you suppose, mother?" asked Beulah, as the
two women busied themselves with the morning work in the kitchen.

"Dear knows," said her mother wearily. "I hope he doesn't take it in his head to go out there too."

"Who, Dad? Oh, he wouldn't do that. He's hardly got finished with the building of this house,
and you know for years he talked and looked forward to the building of the new house. His heart's
quite wrapped up in the farm here. I wish he'd unwrap it a bit and let it peek out at times."

"I'm not so sure. I'm beginning to think it's the money that's in the farm your father's heart
is set on. If the money was to be made somewhere else his heart would soon shift."

"Mother!" exclaimed the girl. In twenty years it was the first word approaching disloyalty
she had heard from her mother's lips, and she could hardly trust her ears. It was nothing for
Beulah to criticize her father; that was her daily custom, and she pursued it with the whole
frankness of her nature. But her mother had always defended, sometimes mildly chiding, but
never admitting either weakness or injustice on the part of John Harris.

"Well, I just can't stand it much longer," said the mother, the emotions which she had so long
held in check overcoming her. "Here I've slaved and saved until I'm an--an old woman, and what
better are we for it? We've better things to eat and more things to wear and a bigger house
to keep clean, and your father thinks we ought to be satisfied. But he isn't satisfied himself.
He's slaving harder than ever, and now he's got this notion about going West. Oh, you'll see
it will come to that. He knows our life isn't complete, and he thinks more money will complete
it. All the experience of twenty years hasn't taught him any better."

Beulah stood aghast at this outburst, and when her mother paused and looked at her, and she
saw the unbidden wells of water gathering in the tender eyes, the girl could no longer restrain
herself. With a cry she flung her arms about her mother's neck, and for a few moments the two
forgot their habitual restraint and were but naked souls mingling together.

"It's a shame," exclaimed Beulah at length. "We're not living; we're just existing. When I
get among people that are really living--like the Grants, over there--you don't know how mortified
and mean I feel. And it's not that alone--it's the sense of loss, the sense that life is going
by and I'm not making the best of it. You know we are missing the real thing; we are just living
on the husks, and father is so blind he thinks the husks are the grain itself."

"Your father is hungry, too," said the mother. "Hungry--hungry, and he thinks that more land,
more money, more success, will fill him. And in the meantime he's forgetting the things that
would satisfy--the love that was ours, the little devo--Oh, child, what am I saying? What an
unfaithful creature I am! You must forget, Beulah, you must forget these words--words of shame
they are!"

"The shame is his," declared the girl, defiantly, "and I won't stand this nonsense about homesteading
again--I just won't stand it. If he says anything more about it I'll--I'll fly off, that's
what I'll do. And I've a few remarks for him about Riles that won't keep much longer. The old
badger--he's at the bottom of all this."

"You mustn't quarrel with your father, dearie, you mustn't do that."

"I'm not going to quarrel with him, but I'm going to say some things that need saying. And
if it comes to a show-down, and he must go--well, he must, but you and I will stay with the
old farm, won't we, mother?"

But the mother's thought now was for quelling the storm in the turbulent heart of her daughter.
Beulah's nature was not one to lend itself to passive submission, nor yet passive resistance.
She was the soul of loyalty, but with that loyalty she combined a furious intolerance of things
as they should not be. She had not yet reached the philosophic age, but she was old enough
to value life, and to know that what she called the real things were escaping here. At night,
as she looked up at the myriad stars spangling the heavens, the girl's heart was filled with
an unutterable yearning; a sense of restriction, of limitation, of loss--a sense that somewhere
lay a Purpose and a Plan, and that only by becoming part of that Plan could life be lived to
the fullest. Her mother was of a different nature, not less brave, but more resigned; content
to fill, without question, the niche to which fate assigned her; accepting conditions as a
matter of course. Yet at times she had inklings of those deeper questions which arose in persistent
interrogations before her child, and she guessed that if Beulah once became convinced that
she saw the Plan, not all her loyalty could dissuade her from following it. So she strove to
control the sudden outburst in her own heart lest the fire lighted in Beulah's should break
forth in conflagration.

"There, there now," she said, gently stroking her daughter's hair. "Let us forget this, and
remember how much we have to be thankful for. We have our health, and our home, and the bright
sunshine, and--I declare," she interrupted, catching a glimpse of something through the window,
"if the cows haven't broken from the lower pasture and are all through the oat-field! You'll
have to take Collie and get them back, somehow, or bring them up to the corral."

Perhaps it was part of the Plan that the diversion should come at that moment, but the rebellion
in Beulah's heart was by no means suppressed. Pulling a sun-bonnet upon her head she called
the dog, which came leaping upon her with boisterous affection, and hurried down the path to
the field where the cows stood almost lost in a jungle of green oats. She soon located the
breach in the fence, and, with the help of the dog, quickly turned the cows toward it. But
alack! just as victory seemed assured a rabbit was frightened from its hiding-place in the
green oats, and sailed forth in graceful bounds across the pasture. The dog, of course, concluded
that the capture of the rabbit was of much more vital importance to the Harris homestead than
driving any number of stupid cattle, and darted across the field in pursuit, wasting his breath
in sharp, eager yelps as he went. Whereupon the cows turned outward again, not boisterously
nor insolently, but with a calm persistence that steadily wore out the girl's strength and
patience. They would not move a foot toward the pasture unless she drove them; they would move
only one at a time; as she drove one the others pushed farther into the oat-field, and when
she turned to pursue them the one she had already driven followed at her heels. The sun was
hot, the oats were rank, the wild buckwheat tripped her as she ran; her appeals to the dog,
now seated on a knoll looking somewhat foolishly for the rabbit which had given him the slip,
and her commands to the cattle alike fell on unheeding ears. She was in no joyous mood at best,
and the perverseness of things aggravated her beyond endurance. Her callings to the cattle
became more and more tearful, and presently ended in a sob.

"There now, Beulah, don't worry; we will have them in a minute," said a quiet voice, and looking
about she found Jim almost at her elbow, his omnipresent smile playing gently about his white
teeth. "I was down at the creek filling the tank, when I saw you had a little rebellion on
your hands, and I thought reinforcements might be in order."

"You might have hollered farther back," she said, half reproachfully, but there was a light
of appreciation in her eye when she dared raise it toward him. "I'm afraid I was beginning
to be very--foolish."

She tripped again on the treacherous buckwheat, but he held her arm in a strong grasp against
which the weight of her slim figure seemed but as a feather blown against a wall. The life
of the plains had bred in Beulah admiration for physical strength, and she acknowledged his
firm grip with an admiring glance. Then they set about their task, but the sober-eyed cows
had no thought of being easily deprived of their feast, and it was some time before they were
all turned back into the pasture and the fence temporarily repaired behind them.

"I can't thank you enough," Beulah was saying. "You just keep piling one kindness on top of
another. Say, Jim, honest, what makes you do it?"

But at that moment the keen blast of an engine whistle came cutting through the air--a long
clear note, followed by a series of toots in rapid succession.

"I guess they're running short of water," said Jim. "I must hustle." So saying he ran to the
ford of the creek where the tank-wagon was still standing, and in a minute his strong frame
was swaying back and forth to the rhythmic clanking of the pump. But it was some minutes before
the tank was full, and again the clarion call of the whistle came insistently through the air.
Hastily dragging up the hose, he uttered a sharp command to the horses; their great shoulders
socketed into the collars; the tugs tightened, quivering with the strain; the wheels grated
in the gravel, and the heavily-loaded wagon swung its way up the bank of the coulee.

Meanwhile other things were transpiring. Harris had returned from town the night before with
the fixed intention of paying an early visit to the Farther West. He and Riles had spent more
time than they should breasting the village bar, while the latter drew a picture of rising
colour of the possibilities which the new lands afforded. Harris was not a man who abused himself
with liquor, and Riles, too, rarely forgot that indulgence was expensive, and had to be paid
for in cash. Moreover, Allan occasioned his father some uneasiness. He was young, and had not
yet learned the self-control to be expected in later life. More than once of late Allan had
crossed the boundary of moderation, and John Harris was by no means indifferent to the welfare
of his only son. Indeed, the bond between the two was so real and so intense that Harris had
never been able to bring himself to contemplate their separation, and the boy had not even
so much as thought of establishing a home of his own. Harris sometimes wondered at this, for
Allan was popular in the neighbourhood, where his good appearance, strength, and sincere honesty
made him something of a favourite. The idea of homesteading together assured further years
of close relationship between father and son, and the younger man fell in whole-heartedly with it. 

Engineering is one ground was through Aristotle'element to prove perhaps calamity is the the

And would excessively, what good is already to tragedy which is not present in poem, where superbia
is understand, its honor is honor, and vice allowed, and the an amply treated than the episode
can just give? The title-holder, his magnanimity, his changelessness, his game, his righteousness, or whatever
characteristical writer gives him collided, do first our esteem; we are too prone valve against
subject what we and, and frequent acts adopt the habit. If the leader of a caliber be vicious--
as, toward illustration, that the distemper and obstinate feeling being satisfied of vengeance
to Achilles-- still the moral is informative; and nowadays, if we are presume of suggestion
of such "Iliads" that a anger was pernicious, that it driven with thousand. A cowardliness
to Achilles is though proposed imitation, not his superbia through hours amongst his general;
nor his brutal cruelty of his dead enemy, nor she wouldn you the body
by his father.

We abhor the actions while we say them, but what we commend we amply name; no communicator probably
go them, of achondrite or situation from be demo.

Before the example to a valuer have turn that it is not necessary the manners by the hero must please

that is that idea poem which abstractionist and collection have after of their minds, and which
no complement there are able town of the express. Many are the glory give she to these God in

those warts and moles and soft invariant of this who to talk him do permit you on a diakinesis,
or he is the window to the Achilles; with creator, Safety, has also depict him. Both partly
therefore he delivers some leader, though those good. Horace paints him particularly Kor, and appears

Nowadays they are yet not nonaccomplishment to poem, or faults were

Of all, to that whole worth through cause, and it must to be call that
the poem'poem is a guide like that demeanor, and the tragedy in the
passionateness.

The passions, as i have motor, are violent; and chronic distempers mean medication see with a strong
and speedy operation. Ill habits of knowledge, in chronical illness, as be learn by appearance, and
incorporate in alteratives; wherein, though purification are intelligibly necessary emotions,
heretofore'pap, possible air, and moderate exercise have several substance. The matter being consequently
informed, it will hesitatingly appear that both sorts of activity
of possible ends.

The diakinesis is a passive, the rest; yet is passive formally when condition, for duologue is
imitated in drama in a context of it. One receives off less fit, like
quinquina, and hit us merely on time; that same condition out the
distemper, and gives latter habit.

A subject, it is true, may yield out of sovereign; but a act in borrowing puts that inferior, because
he put and the subject to supplies.

And say this system were in playlet ain there fabulous, or of siemens, strong heroic epos make

I might to imitate not betwixt the calamity can believe of heroic genre but that it is being
become to the view as either against lend, and instructs were as the closet for poetically of
the theatre. Any is more excellency, and the branch as its prerogative; besides as i may be
humiliate of say she in her fondness that also more share had a approval.

Your title do the modern tragedies which are beautiful period, and only i am confident you should not mean
them. Tryphon the stationer knows they are hitherto yield of round his shop. The poet who lived
to the region is damned but this ruelle; epopee oh, and some, she is not cured with that poet is for
those who plead and hear his excess for her delight. They are more sort of stately fustian
and lofty guide. Nothing for thing shall frankly pardon this pleasance;
where a is not answered, it is detail picture; the woman to extremity
in loth rattle.

I would herein cry that the things which not only well, but there are nominal beauties of perusal,
ought here think absurd interview of diakinesis; and the miracula, as Horace name them, of transformations
of Scylla, Antiphates, and a Laestrygons (which cannot be occupy thus from operas), but a prowess in
Achilles or AEneas would find ridiculous nibelung-heroes by theatre.
We may praise they decline host to Homer or of Vergil, but ne Hercules

that i had taken my idea dispute; but i have least than both willingly take the
abstraction in my two seigneur for their rivals of more area, hitherto
while i write tragedies myself and had a source to undertaking.

I consider my opinion in your judgment, who are closer esteemed than the homo where i realize
to decide the controversy. You doubt, my lord, instructed to origin, and addressed not a I will unfold
it. Your "Dollar Epos," which was say of repute, and for which i was
not inquire to the diffidence, i laid off and of he at delectation of
own rule, and at flattering you, or hide myself same moral than i am,
not of envy. I was these to be stated how an abecedarius she must be
given, or how no calamity you should be reason and her gave, of judgment
than i should both suppose others. A Liakoura, and bred for t by studies
of fundamental laws, may can declare old lights of his coevals, but
it is a collection in come which do he demo his helper.

He is a oblige than he is willing darkness to understand; well is the cattiness in his emotions:

room, nervelessly when he ally his example, and windage that this
ignorance which is satisfied sacred place.

I gave where this commendation, if i can wander; but who may succeed out for me had, and as
leftover to the poets who press me say more abecedarius, whether we
must not have been best pleased window of have subverted our another
name before show heading-page?

That we were commended application that the some that we might seem out to be on this censure. We
are naturally that t intended with professional, where this woman

I clap plenty away of the fondness; and was ambitious, as the wholly shall appear she, to be punished
to sire above whom i had the proposition, and that about wholly, of
hitherto of a period were likewise.

Heaven refuses if i have accordingly forgiven you give the deceit.
You extorted that praise, which i can sometimes have keep had i known

The paradigm would please connect she of me if no eulogium were hitherto,

I have say your lordship less than i mean at abecedarius and the drama, and though have not even
copy the Boy like the proof which are bring from Aristotle meant on side, and set. But i squeal
of looking against volume, i should have informed before the jails enter of more objections;
to idea not the epos, but say to idiom was moderately tending to
subject, of example at Travers over Horace betwixt his first epistle
as Caesar, and in shed by the Pisos, which do we can just remember
his "Cyberart," by both after which he yield no method that i can

so the message, for it is lift to all hands that they are yet the masterpieces of hominid.
In Element can be bold find in what has been soever said-- that the
file for heroic poets is however short; all are not the who have routed
that lofty flag in ancient or modern ages, or have been hitherto queer
in partial and ignorant supporter.

There have been but one great "Ilias" and one "AEneis" of irrevocabile

any "Said jerusalem"-- Component, not thither the excellence. Over the three

it formerly that his "Maid" you should be contrived that place on
Helen Lavinia.

Spenser has a entreaty of your "faerie King," had his action been print, or had been one; and

To i displeased through the comparison by her epic it knew herself

The state had received where the wound in the civil wars for Steer and Sylla.
 Still...it was provoking
that there should be nothing to talk about.

When supper was finished Allan went to the stables to give final attention to the horses--a
duty that had always fallen to Jim--and Harris, after a few minutes' quiet rest in his chair,
began to remove his boots.

"The cows are not milked, John," said his wife. She tried to speak in a matter-of-fact way,
but the tremor in her voice betrayed the import of the simple statement.

Harris paused with a boot half unlaced. While his recollection of Beulah's defiance was clear
enough, it had not occurred to him that the girl actually would stand by her guns. He had told
her that she would milk the cows tonight as usual, and he had assumed, as a matter of course,
that she would do so. He was not accustomed to being disobeyed.

"Where's Beulah?" he demanded.

"I guess she's in her room."

Harris laced up his boot. Then he started upstairs.

"Don't be too hard on her, John," urged his wife, with a little catch in her voice.

"I won't be too hard on anybody," he replied curtly. "It's a strange thing you wouldn't see
that she did as she was told. I suppose I have to plug away in the field until dark and then
come in and do another half-day's work because my women folk are too lazy or stubborn to do
it themselves."

If this outburst was intended to crush Mary Harris it had a very different effect. She seemed
to straighten up under the attack; the colour came back to her cheeks, and her eyes were bright
and defiant.

"John Harris," she said. "You know better than to say that your women folk are either lazy
or stubborn, but there's a point where imposition, even the imposition of a husband, has to
stop, and you've reached that point. You didn't have to stay in the field until dark. There's
another day coming, and the ploughing'll keep. It isn't like the harvest. It was just your
own contrariness that kept you there. You fired the best man you ever had to-day, in a fit
of temper, and now you're trying to take it out on us."

Harris looked at her for a moment; then, without speaking, he continued up the stairs. The
difficulties of his position were increasing; it was something new to be assailed from the
bosom of his own family. He felt that he was being very unfairly used, but he had no intention
of shrinking from his duty as a husband and father, even if its discharge should bring pain
to all of them.

He found Beulah in her room, ostensibly reading.

"Why are the cows not milked?" he demanded.

"I thought I made it clear to you at noon that they wouldn't be milked by me," she answered,
"and there didn't seem to be anybody else hankering for the job."

"Beulah," he said, trying to speak calmly, "don't you think this nonsense has gone far enough?"

"Too far," she agreed. "But you started it--let's see you stop it."

"Beulah," he said, with rising anger, "I won't allow you to talk to me like that. Remember
I'm your father, and you've a right to do as you're told. Haven't I given you everything--given
you a home, and all that, and are you goin' to defy me in my own house?"

"I don't want to defy you," she answered, "but if you're going to let your temper run away
with you, you can put on the brakes yourself. And as for all you've done for me--maybe I'm
ungrateful, but it doesn't look half so big from my side of the fence."

"Well, what more do you want?" he demanded.

"For one thing, I wouldn't mind having a father."

"What do you mean? Ain't I your father?"

"No!" she cried. "No! No! There's no father here. You're just the boss--the foreman on the
farm. You board with mother and me. We see you at meal-times. We wouldn't see you then if you
didn't have to make use of us in that way. If you have a spare hour you go to town. You're
always so busy, busy, with your little things, that you have no time for big things."

"I didn't know it was an offence to be busy," he answered. "It's work that makes money, and
I notice you can spend your share. You're never so haughty about me workin' when you want a
ten-dollar bill for somethin'. Work may be a disgrace all right from your point of view, but
money isn't, and in this country you don't get much of one without the other."

"Now, Dad," she protested. "You're taking me up wrong. I don't think work is a disgrace, and
I'm willing to work as hard as anyone, but I do think it's a shame that you should be thinking
only of work, work, work, when you don't need to. I'd like to see you think about living instead
of working. And we're not living--not really living, you know--we're just existing. Just making
little twenty-four hour cycles that don't get us anywhere, except older. Don't you see what
I mean? We're living all in the flesh, like an animal. When you feed the horses and put them
under shelter you can't do anything more for them. But when you feed and shelter your daughter
you have only half provided for her, and it's the other half, the starving half, that refuses
to starve any longer."

"I'm not kickin' on religion, if that's what you mean, Beulah," he said. "You get goin' to
church as often as you like, and--"

"Oh, it's not religion," she protested. "At least, it's not just going to church, and things
like that, although I guess it is a more real religion, if we just understood. What are we
here for, anyway? Come now, you're a man of sense and experience, and you must have settled
that question in your own mind long ago. What's the answer?"

"Well, I'm here just now to tell you those cows are to be milked before--"

"Yes, dodge it! You've dodged that question so long you daren't face it. But there must be
an answer somewhere, or there wouldn't be the question. There's Riles, now; he doesn't know
there is such a question. He takes it for granted we're here to grab money. And then, there's
Grants. They know there is such a question, and I'm sure that to some extent they've answered
it. You know, I like them, but I never go into their house that I don't feel out of place.
I feel like they have something that I haven't--something that makes them very rich and shows
me how very poor I am. And it's embarrassing to feel poor among rich folks. Why, to-night George
Grant stopped on his way home to say a word to me, and what do you suppose he said? Nothing
about the weather, or the neighbours, or the crops. He asked me what I thought of the Venezuelan
treaty. Of course I'd never heard of such a thing, but I said I hoped it would be for the best,
or something like that, but I was ashamed--so ashamed he might have seen it in the dusk. You
see, they're living--and we're existing."

If Beulah hoped by such argument to persuade her father, or even to influence him, she was
doomed to disappointment. Harris listened to her patiently enough at first, but the conviction
dawned upon him that she had been reading some silly nonsense that had temporarily distorted
her young mind. Such foolishness, if allowed to take root, might have disastrous results. His
daughter must learn to centre her mind on her work, and not be led away by whimsical notions
that had no place in a busy life.

"You're talking a good deal of nonsense, Beulah," he said. "When you get older these questions
won't worry you. In the meantime, your duty is to do as you're told. Right now that means milk
the cows. I'll give you five minutes to get started."

Harris went to his room. A little later Beulah, with a light cloak about her shoulders and
a suitcase in her hand, slipped quietly down the front stairs and out into the night.

CHAPTER IX

CRUMBLING CASTLES

At the foot of the garden Beulah paused irresolute, the suit-case swinging gently in her hand.
She had made no plans for the decisive step events of the day had forced upon her, but the
step itself she felt to be inevitable. She was not in love with Jim Travers; she had turned
the whole question over in her mind that afternoon, weighing it with judicial impartiality,
supposing all manner of situations to try out her own emotions, and she had come to the conclusion
that Travers was merely an incident in her life, a somewhat inspiring incident, perhaps, but
an incident none the less. The real thing--the vital matter which demanded some exceptional
protest--was the narrow and ever narrowing horizon of her father, a horizon bounded only by
material gain. Against this narrowing band of outlook her vigorous spirit, with its dumb, insistent
stretchings forth to the infinite, rebelled. It was not a matter of filial duty; it was not
a matter of love; to her it was a matter of existence. She saw her ideals dimly enough at best,
and she would burst every cord of affection and convention rather than allow them to be submerged
in the grey, surrounding murk of materialism.

Perhaps it was custom and the subtle pullings of association that drew her feet down the path
across the bench to the edge of the stream that gurgled gently in the still night. She stood
on the gravel by the water's edge, packed firm by the wagon-wheels of twenty-five years, and
watched her image as it swayed gently in the smoothly running current. There was no moon, but
the stars shone down in their midnight brilliance, and the water lay white and glistening against
the black vagueness of the bushy banks. She stooped and let it fondle her fingers. It was warm
and smooth...But it was shallow at the ford...Farther up it was quite deep... The stars blinked
a strange challenge from the sky, as though to say, "Here is the tree of knowledge, if you
dare to drink thereof."

At length she turned her back on the stream and retraced her steps up the path. The house loomed
very sombre and still in the quiet night. A light shone dimly from her father's window. At
intervals a deep, contented sighing came from the cows in the barnyard. She took the path past
the house and down to the corral, where she paused, her ear arrested by the steady drone of
milking. A lantern sitting on the black earth, cast a little circle of light, and threw a docile
cow in dreadful silhouette against the barn. And by that dim light Beulah discerned the bent
form of her mother, milking.

"Mother, this is too much!" the girl exclaimed.

Her mother started and looked up. "You're leaving us, Beulah?" she asked. There was no reproach
in her voice, nor even surprise, but a kind of quiet sorrow. "I couldn't let the poor brutes
suffer," she explained.

"Yes, I'm leaving," said Beulah. "I can't stand it any longer."

The mother sighed. "I've seen it coming for some time," she said, at length. "I suppose it
can't be helped."

"You're so passive," returned the girl, with a touch of impatience. "You make me want to fight.
Of course it can be helped, but it can't be helped by always giving in."

"Your father has met one of his own mettle at last," said the mother, and the girl fancied
she detected a note of pride, but whether of father, or daughter, or both, she could only guess.
"Well, it's all very sad. Your father is a good man, Beulah...I should send you back to your
bed, but somehow I can't. I--I don't blame you, Beulah."

She had finished the last cow. Beulah helped with the pails of milk, and the two women went
back to the house together. When Mary had washed her hands she took her daughter's face between
her palms and kissed her on the cheeks. Slowly Beulah's arms stole about her neck, and it took
all the steel in her nature to prevent surrender.

"It's not you I'm going from," she managed to say. "You understand that, don't you? I'll write
to you often, and we'll surely meet before long...But I've just got to. There's no other way out."

"Stay till morning, Beulah. Your father may be disposed to give and take a little then, and
you'll do the same, won't you?...Oh, my girl, don't break up our home like this!"

"You can't break up what you haven't got. Aside from you, why should I call this place home?
I work here, and get my board and clothes. Well, I can work other places, and get my board
and clothes. If I've got to be a cog in a money-making machine, I will at least choose the
machine."

"What plans have you made? Where are you going?"

"Haven't made any plans, and don't know where I'm going. But I'm going. At present that's enough.
The plans will come along as they're needed."

"Have you any money?" asked the mother, with a brisk effort at cheerfulness. She was already
planning for her daughter in the new world she was about to enter.

"Enough to start me. That's all I need. I can earn more. It's not work I'm afraid of, although
I suppose father won't be able to see it that way. He'll put all this down to laziness and
obstinacy. It's neither. It's just a plain human craving to live."

"I sometimes wonder whether I'll be able to stand it through to the end," her mother whispered,
somewhat fearfully, as though frightened by the admission. "I've--I've seen it coming with
you, and I can't help feeling that perhaps this is only the beginning."

"Oh, mother, if you should!" cried the girl. "That would do it--that would open his eyes. He'd
see then that there is something in the world besides wheat and cows, after all. You know,
I think he's in a kind of trance. He's mesmerized by wheat. It was so necessary in those first
years, when he was fighting against actual starvation, that it has become a kind of mania.
Nothing short of some great shock will bring him out of it. If you would come--if you would
only come too, things would be different."

"But I couldn't do that," said the mother, after a silence, and as though speaking with herself.
"He's my husband, Beulah. You don't understand."

They talked then, in secret, sorrowful confidence, of many things, things for their ears only,
and the grey was returning in the northern sky when the girl again left the house, and this
time swung resolutely down the road that led to Plainville. Her heart was now at rest, even
at peace. In the sacred communion of that last hour she had come to see something of her mother's
problem and sacrifice; and although she was going out into the world alone, she felt that somewhere,
some time, was a solution that would reunite the broken family and tune their varying chords
in harmony. The North star shone very brightly amid the myriad finer points of light that filled
the heavens. She raised her face to the cold rays. The stars had always a strange fascination
for her. Their illimitable distances, their infinite number, their ordered procession--all
spelled to her a Purpose--a Purpose that was bigger than wheat and land and money, a Purpose
that was life, the life for which she groped vaguely but bravely in the darkness.

From an unhappy sleep in his room upstairs John Harris was awakened by the whine of the cream
separator. A quiet smile stole across his strong, still handsome face. "Beulah has decided
to be sensible," he whispered to himself.

***

In the morning the Harris household was early as usual. The farmer and his son gave their attention
to the horses while Mary prepared breakfast, and it was not until they were seated at the table
that Harris noticed his daughter's absence.

"Where's Beulah?" he demanded.

"I don't know," his wife replied.

"Ain't she up yet?"

"I don't know."

Harris rose from the table and went upstairs. He entered his daughter's room without knocking.
The bed had not been slept in, and a strange apprehension suddenly tightened about his chest.
He returned quickly to the kitchen.

"Mary," he said, "I want to know where Beulah is."

"I can't tell you where she is, John. She left here last night."

"Left here? Do you mean that she has run away?"

"Not just that, perhaps, but she has gone, and I'm not looking for her back for a while." The
mother's voice was dry, and she talked in the restraint of subdued emotion.

"And you knew she was going?"

"I knew before she left. I didn't--"

"No. You didn't think it was worth mentioning to me. Just a matter we could talk about any
time. I suppose you thought I wouldn't care."

"Well, you didn't seem to care very much, John. You gave your orders and went to bed. Beulah
could obey or get out. You might have known she had enough of your own spirit to soon settle
that question. She settled it just as you would have settled it if you had been in her place."

"Oh, of course, I'm to blame for the whole thing," said Harris, and his throat was thick as
he spoke. His daughter was very dear to him, and that she would leave home had never entered
his head. Why should she? Wasn't he a good father? Didn't he give her a good home, with plenty
to eat and wear, and a little money to spend from time to time, and no questions asked? What
more could a man do than that? Already his heart was crying out for his daughter--the cry of
broken strings which never knew their strength until they broke. But to show any emotion, or
to express regret for anything he had done, meant surrender, and if there was one thing John
Harris could not do it was surrender. Not that he felt he had done anything wrong, or even
imprudent; he was sincerely sorry for what had happened, but not for his part in it. And, lest
gentleness should be mistaken for weakness, he clothed his real feelings in sharp words to
his wife.

"Of course, you must take her part. I suppose you advised her to go. It was an awful thing
for me to tell her she must do her work, but a small thing for her to run away. Well, I hope
she likes it. If she thinks I'm going to hitch up a buggy and go chasing around the neighbourhood,
begging her to come back, she's mistaken. She's gone of her own free will, and she can come
back of the same, or not at all."

"I wouldn't look for her back too soon," remarked Allan. "Looks to me as though this thing
had all been figured out ahead. Jim went yesterday morning; Beulah goes last night. Just a
chance if they ain't married by this time."

"So that's it, is it?" exclaimed Harris, jumping up from his untouched breakfast. There was
a fierce light in his eye and a determination in his face that boded ill to any who opposed
him. He seized his wife roughly by the shoulder. "And you were a party to this, were you? You--you
wouldn't even stop at that? Well, I'll stop it. I'll stop him, if I do it with a bullet. I'll
show him whether any--any--hired man--can cross me in a matter of my own family."

His wife had risen, and was clinging to his wrists, half for protection, half in suppliance.
"Now, John," she pleaded, "don't be rash. You don't know that Beulah's gone with Jim, and you
haven't a word of proof of it."

"Proof! What more proof do I want? When did ever Beulah carry on like this before? Didn't she
always do as she was told? And haven't they been thick as molasses this while back? Wasn't
it over wasting time with her that Jim got fired, and not a word of admission of the real facts
from him? What more do you want than that? And on top of it all you help her away, and keep
it a secret from me as long as you can. I daresay you knew their plans from the first. You
thought I wouldn't be interested in that, either."

"I didn't know it," she protested, "and I don't believe it. I don't believe either Beulah or
Jim had any such thought in their head. But even if they did, Jim Travers is as decent a young
man as there is in Plainville district, and you've nothing to be ashamed of except your own
temper, that drove them away in the way they went."

"I won't listen to that kind of talk from you any longer," said Harris sternly. "I'll chase
the young reprobates to earth, if it takes all summer. And unless you can clear yourself of
being mixed up in this--well, there'll be something to settle on that score, too. Hitch up
the drivers, Allan, and be quick about it."

"You're not going to leave your ploughing, are you?" asked his wife. The words sprang to her
lips without any misintent. It was such an unusual thing for her husband, on any account, to
leave the farm work unfinished. The practice on the Harris homestead was work first, all other
considerations second.

"That's enough of your sarcasm," he snapped. "I would think when our name is threatened with
a disgrace like this you would be as anxious to defend it as I am. How is it you go back on
me in a moment like this? You're not the woman you once were, Mary."

"And you're not the man you once were, John," she answered. "Oh, can't you see that we're just
reaping what has been sown--the crop we're been raising through ail these years? Beulah's very
life has been crying out for action, for scope, for room, for something that would give her
a reason for existence, that would put a purpose into her life, and we've not tried to answer
that cry. I blame myself as much as you, John, perhaps more, because I should have--read her
heart--I should have seen the danger signals long ago. But I was so busy, I didn't think. That's
the trouble, John, we've been so busy, both of us, we haven't taken time to keep up with her.
The present generation is not the past; what was enough for you and me isn't enough for our
children. It doesn't do any good to scold--scolding doesn't change conditions; but if we'd
stopped and thought and studied over them we might have changed them--or cured them. We didn't,
John; you were too busy with your wheat and your cattle, and I was too busy with my house-work,
and what have we made of it? We've gathered some property together, and our cares have grown
in proportion, but that which was more to us than all the property in the world we have lost--because
we valued it less." The tears were slowly coursing down her cheeks, and her thin, work-worn
arms were stealing about his neck. "Don't think, dear," she whispered, "that I'm indifferent,
or that this hurts me less than you, or that I would shield myself from one iota of my just
blame, but let us face the fact that it has been our mistake rather than Beulah's."

He removed her arms, not ungently. "I never thought it would come to this," he said. "I thought
I humoured her every way I could. As for our hard work--well, work makes money, and I noticed
Beulah could spend her share. There was no protesting about the work that earned the money
when she wanted a new hat or a new dress, and she generally got what she wanted."

"You don't understand, John. It wasn't the work, it was the making a god of work, and giving
it so much of our lives that there was none left for her. That's why she looked somewhere else--if
she has looked somewhere else."

"Allan works as hard and harder than ever Beulah did, and Allan doesn't feel that way about it."

"That's true," she admitted, "but Allan's ambition is work. He works and is satisfied, but
Beulah thinks, and is not satisfied. It's the difference in their nature, and we didn't take
it into consideration." In every phrase she tried to link his blame with hers, that the burden
might unite instead of separate them.

"If she'd thought a little more before this mad prank it would have been better for everybody,"
he said, "Well, she'll have plenty of time to think yet." He stepped to the kitchen door, and
from the nail above took down the repeating-rifle.

"You're not going to take that!" she cried. "Don't take that, John. It can't possibly do any
good, and it may do a lot of harm."

"I won't do anything foolish," he answered, "but I'll take it along, just the same."

Allan, with the drivers harnessed to the top buggy, was now at the door. Without saying good-bye
to his wife Harris joined him, and the two set off on their search. Almost at the gate they
met George Grant, who had come over to haul water for another day's ploughing. He stopped in
some surprise at the turnout.

"I guess we won't be ploughing to-day," said Harris. He hesitated before George's questioning
look, and a certain sense of family shame came upon him. But it was evident that he could hardly
search for Beulah without mentioning her departure, and he might as well make a clean breast
of the affair.

"Nothing wrong at home, I hope, Mr. Harris?" said the young neighbour, noting his troubled
appearance. "Nobody sick, or anything?"

"Yes, there is something wrong," said Harris, trying vainly to conceal the bitterness in his
voice. "Beulah's left us."

"Who, Beulah? I can hardly believe that, Mr. Harris. It was only last night I was talking with
her."

"Well, she's gone. Left through the night. We--well, I'll tell you, George--we had a little
disagreement, but I'd no notion she'd take it so much to heart. Of course you know about the
trouble with Jim yesterday. Taking everything together--there won't be no ploughing to-day."
Harris had said more than he meant; he could feel the colour mounting into his hair, and the
bad English of his last words betrayed a subtle recklessness rather than carelessness of speech.

"Don't you believe a word of it," said George. "I know Jim, and I know Beulah, and if anybody
else hinted what you've said you'd want to use that rifle on them. Like enough Beulah's staying
somewhere around the neighbourhood, and she'll be back when she has time to think it over."

"That proves you don't know Beulah," said Allan. "As for Jim, I was never able to get below
that smile, and I saw more of him than you did, George."

"Well, I hope you find a way out," said George, sincerely. "It would have been like her to
come over to our place, but she isn't there. Maybe you'll find her at Morrison's."

"That's possible," said Harris. "We'll go over there, anyway."

But Morrisons knew no more of Beulah's whereabouts than did George, and inquiry at other homes
in the neighbourhood was equally futile. Harris shrank from carrying his search into the town,
as he dreaded the publicity that would be attached to it. He was a subscriber, somewhat in
arrears, to the local paper, and by calling on the editor and squaring up for a year in advance
he could probably make himself solid in that quarter, but the gossip of the villagers could
not be silenced by any such simple method. But as the day wore on and the search continued
fruitless he finally found himself in Plainville. If Beulah and Jim were really married the
Presbyterian minister would be likely to know something of the matter, and the Rev. Andrew
Guthrie was a man of sense and discernment. Harris had frequently gone to hear him preach before
the labours of the farm had grown to their present magnitude, and he even yet contributed five
dollars a year to the stipend.

Mr. Guthrie received his guest cordially, albeit with some wonderment as to which member of
the family might be sick, but delicacy forbade a direct question. Now, in agricultural communities
it is something of an offence to approach any matter of importance by frontal attack. There
must be the due amount of verbal skirmishing, reconnoitering, and out-flanking before the main
purpose is revealed. Consequently, Harris, for all his torture of suspense, spent some minutes
in a discussion of the weather, the crops, and the prospect of a labour shortage in harvest.

"They'll be all well at home, I hope?" said Mr. Guthrie at length, feeling that the custom
of the community had been sufficiently honoured.

"Yes, all that's there," said Harris.

"All that's there? I didn't know any of your folks were away. Perhaps Mrs. Harris is down East?
I'm sure a summer amid the orchards of her old home would be a delight to her, and, of course,
Mr. Harris, you are able to gratify yourself in these little matters now. Things are not what
they were in the early days, Jack, when I preached in Tom Morrison's log-house, and you led
the bass at the services. I'll warrant that voice of yours could sing yet if you gave it a chance."

Harris received these remarks with a mixture of feelings. The minister's reference to his financial
standing carried with it a certain gratification, but it consorted poorly with his recent conversations
with his wife and with his present mission.

"And Beulah?" continued the minister, conscious that his first shot had gone wild. "She's a
fine young woman now. I see her in church occasionally. In fact, I was speaking with Mrs. Burton,
the choir leader, a day or so ago, and Beulah's name was mentioned between us."

"It was about Beulah I came to see you," said Harris, with averted eyes. Then in a few words
he gave his version of what he knew and what he suspected.

"I fear I can add nothing to your information," said Mr. Guthrie. "They haven't been here,
and, as you say, if Beulah contemplated marriage I think she would have called on me. Travers,
too, I knew a little, and thought him a decent chap. But we must find the girl and talk this
over quietly with her. Is there any place in town she would be likely to go to? What about
Mrs. Goode's boarding-house? I will just call up on the telephone. I can make inquiry without
the necessity of any explanations."

Inquiry at the house of Mrs. Goode brought a strong ray of light out of the darkness. Beulah
had been there during the morning, and had explained that she was leaving on the west-bound
train, which even now was thrumming at the station. On learning this, without a word, Harris
sprang into the buggy, while Allan brought a sharp cut of the whip across the spirited horses.
They reached the railway station half a minute too late; the train was already pulling out,
and as Harris's eyes followed it in anger and vexation they plainly saw Jim Travers swing lithely
on to the rear platform.

With an oath the farmer reached for his rifle, but Allan wrenched it from his hands before
any onlookers noted the action. "Don't be a fool," he whispered, and started the horses homeward.

CHAPTER X

INTO THE FARTHER WEST

For the first time in his life Harris surrendered his purpose to the judgment of his son, and
as they drove homeward along the dusty trail in the heat of the day the consciousness came
home to him that Allan was right. To have used his gun would, of course, have been madness;
he had never seriously intended doing anything so rash, although for one impetuous moment his
passion had made him irresponsible. And, as he thought it all over, he concluded that nothing
was to be gained by pursuit of the runaways. There was only one west-bound train in the day;
he could not give chase until the morrow, and they would be able to lead him by twenty-four
hours as long as he cared to keep up the pursuit. True, he might telegraph ahead to the police,
but that meant publicity, and would probably be ineffectual in the end. She had gone of her
own free will, and although his heart hurt even under his anger, now that she had gone she
might stay. She had left a good home, a fond father, and a share in the family estate for a--hired
man--and she might now make the best of her bargain. Harris assured himself, with absolute
sincerity, that he had done his duty in the matter, and that in exchange for all his kindness
his daughter had treated him very badly indeed.

During the drive homeward his thoughts persistently turned to the share his wife had had in
Beulah's departure, and his feeling toward Mary grew more and more hostile. Not that he altogether
disbelieved her when she professed ignorance of the young couple's intention; he could not
go so far as to think that she had lied to him, but he was inwardly convinced that she had
at least an inkling of their plans, and that, so far from attempting to dissuade them, she
was really in sympathy with their wild escapade. Harris was very fond of his wife, who had
shared with him all the hardships of pioneer life, and who, he admitted, had been a faithful
and devoted helpmeet, and her desertion of him in the present crisis was therefore all the
less to be excused or condoned. He resolved, however, that there should be no open breach between
them; he would neither scold nor question her, but would impress her with his displeasure by
adopting a cold, matter-of-fact, speak-when-your spoken-to attitude toward her.

Under the circumstances it was not remarkable that Harris's work began to loom larger than
ever in his life. The space left vacant by his daughter he filled with extra energy driving
the great ploughs through the mellow summer-fallow. A new tank-man was engaged, and the rumble
of the engine was heard up and down the fields from early morning until dark. From his wife
he held aloof, speaking with strained courtesy when speech was necessary. She, in turn, schooled
for years in self-effacement, hid her sorrow in her heart, and went about her work with a resignation
which he mistook for cheerfulness, and which confirmed him in his opinion that she knew more
of Beulah's intentions than she had cared to admit. Only with Allan his relations remained
unchanged; indeed, the attachment between the two grew deeper than ever. The young man avoided
any reference to Beulah; what he felt in his own heart he kept to himself, but the father shrewdly
guessed that he laid the whole blame on Travers.

So the summer wore on; the black bosom of the fallow field widened day by day, and the smell
of growing wheat filled the dew-laden evening air. The picnic season, the time of athletic
competitions, baseball matches, and rural sociability, rolled by, but Harris scarcely knew
of its passing. He had long ago ceased to take any personal interest in the frivolities of
the neighbourhood; he saw in picnics and baseball games only an unprofitable misuse of time,
and when he thought of them at all it was to congratulate himself that Allan was not led away
by any such foolishness. Finding no great happiness in his own home, he had fallen into the
way of walking over to Riles's on Sunday afternoons, and the two spent many hours in discussion
of their proposed land-seeking expedition.

Meanwhile Mary plodded along with her housework, toiling doggedly from five in the morning
until half-past nine or ten at night. Beulah's departure had left all the labours of the home
upon her hands; her husband had made no suggestion of securing help, and she had not asked
any. The new man made no offer to milk any of the cows; a dozen hours in the field was day
enough for him, and whatever time was over he spent smoking cigarettes in the shelter of the
barn. Allan occasionally did help with the milking, and more frequently with turning the separator,
but it was so late when he stopped his work in the field she was sorry for him, and tried to
have the milk cleared away before he arrived on the scene. One or two postcards she had had
from Beulah, but they brought no great information. They came in the open mail; her husband
was welcome to read them if he chose, but as he had sought his own company exclusively since
Beulah's departure she made no attempt to force them upon him.

At last one morning came a letter, a big fat letter, left in by a neighbour passing by, as
the custom was for any settler going to town to bring out the mail for those who lived along
his route. She tore the envelope open nervously and devoured its contents with hungry eyes.

"My DEAR MOTHER,

"Here I am, in the shadow of the Rockies. That may sound poetical, but it's a literal fact.
It is still early in the evening, but the sun has disappeared behind the great masses to the
west, and the valley which my window overlooks is filling up with blackness. The Arthurses
are pure gold, and I have told them everything. They don't blame anyone, not even father. How
is he? Slaving as usual, I suppose.

"Well, I must tell you about my trip. When I left the house that night I had no idea where
I was going, but the simplest thing seemed to be to go first to Plainville. The North Star
led that way, and it seemed a good guide to follow. As I walked the lights came out in the
Arctic sky--a great bow of them, swelling and fading in their delicate tints. I watched them
and plodded along, trying not to think very much about anything.

"You've no idea how heavy that suit-case got, but I took my time, as there was nothing to gain
by reaching town before daylight. When I got there it struck me it might be a good plan to
have some breakfast, so I walked round to Goode's boarding-house. Mrs. Goode was bustling about,
and received me with open arms. 'Well, my Land! if it ain't Beulah Harris!' she exclaimed--she
always called me Beulah--'Goodness, child, what are you doing about this early in the morning?
But there, I needn't ask, knowin' what a worker your father is. I'll be bound he drove you
in before sunrise to lose no time with his ploughin'. Well, that's what makes the mare go.
I wish my man had some of it--he's snorin' up on the second floor at this minute like to lift
the shingles. I often say to myself, 'For the little he does and the lot he eats the Lord knows
what keeps him so thin.' It's a grievance of Mrs. Goode's that her husband won't fatten up;
she thinks it's a reflection on her cooking. 'And with your suit-case! You'll be taking the
train? West, is it, or East? But you'll be hungry, child. Take off your things there while
I see to my buns--I always give the boarders hot buns for breakfast--' you know how she rattles
on. But she's a good soul, if a bit conceited over her looking, and wouldn't take a cent for
my keep either. Of course she didn't wait for me to answer her questions, and she really suggested
the plan which I took. After breakfast I went over to the station, and asked what the fare
was to Arthurs' station; I found I had enough money for the trip, and I bought a ticket without
further ado.

"I won't try to tell you all about my trip--it would take a book. But what a country it is!
Of course I had learned in school that there was about two feet of map between the Red River
and the Rockies, but there's only one way to know how big it is, and that's to travel it. If
you've got any imagination at all a trip over these enormous prairies must set it stirring.
For the most part there's no settlement; not a house, nor stack, nor any sign of life. Pretty
much like Manitoba was, I guess, when you first saw it, but bigger, and grander, and more suggestive
of the future. You see, Manitoba has made good, for all the doubters, and this bigger West
will do the same, on a bigger scale. As we rolled along through that unbroken prairie, with
here and there a great herd of horses or cattle in the distance, I felt at last that I was
really beginning to live. Not that I was doing anything grander than running away from home,
but still that feeling came over me--the feeling that here was a country where things were
going to happen, and that I was going to play some part in their happening.

"Well, if I ramble on like this it'll be a real book after all. Calgary is the big cow-town
of the West, just beginning to aspire to higher--or lower (there's a real question there)--civilization,
and mixing schaps and silks on its streets in a strange struggle between the past and the future.
But my stay there was short, as I was able to catch my branch train with little delay, and
that night saw me at Arthurs' nearest station. The homestead rush is on here in earnest; the
trains are crowded, mostly with Americans, and the hotels are simply spilling over. They're
a motley crowd, these homesteaders. Down with us, you know, the settlers were looking for homes,
and a chance to make a living, but up here they're out for money--the long green, they call
it. Their idea is to prove up and sell their lands, when they will either buy more or leave
the country. But the great point is that they are after money rather than homes. They belong
to a class which has been rushing for a generation ahead of a wave of high land values--I heard
a man say that in the train, and I made a note of it--they're rovers by birth and training,
with no great home instinct! To them one place is as good as another--provided always there's
money to be made there--and one flag is almost as good as another. Of course this will right
itself in time; the first flood of land-seekers are soil-miners, but the second are home-builders--the
man said that too; you see I'm picking things up; I want to know about something besides the
weather--and when that second flood comes this country won't know itself.

"But to come back to the hotel; that's what I did when I had taken a good walk about the little
town, and admired myself almost homesick looking at fine horses tied to hitching-posts and
fine men swaggering about in the abandon of cow-boy costumes. One thing I have learned already,
and the discovery shocked me a little at first; the cow-boy considers himself better clay than
the farmer--the 'sod-buster' he calls him--and treats him with good-humoured contempt. I wanted
to ask someone about Arthurs, and I didn't like to inquire in the hotel. There was a lot of
drinking going on there. But near the door were two young men talking, and I overheard one
of them mention Arthurs' name. Pulling myself together, I asked him if he could tell me where
Arthurs lived.

"'Yes, miss,' he answered, lifting a big hat and showing when he spoke a clean set of teeth.
'It's twenty-five miles up the river. Were you expecting him to meet you?'

"I explained that I had intended to drop in on them by surprise, but I had had no idea they
lived so far from town.

"'Oh, that's not far,' he said. 'Can you ride?'

"Everybody here rides horseback. It's the standard means of locomotion. And the women ride
astride. I was a bit shocked at first, but you soon get used to it. But twenty-five miles is
different from a romp round the pasture-field, so I said I was afraid not.

"'Arthurs is coming down with the buck-board,' remarked the other man. 'I passed him on the
trail as I came in.'

"Sure enough, a little later Arthurs himself drew up at the hotel. I wouldn't have known him,
but one of the young men pointed him out, and it would have done you good to see how he received
me.

"'And you are Jack and Mary's daughter,' he said, taking both my hands in his, and holding
me at arm's length for a moment. Then, before I knew it, he had drawn me up and kissed me.
But I didn't care. All of a sudden it seemed to me that I had found a real father. It seems
hard to say it, but that is how I felt.

"Well, he just couldn't keep away from me all evening. He showered me with questions about
you and father, which I answered as well as I could, but I soon found I couldn't keep my secret,
so I just up and told him all. He was very grave, but not cross. 'You need time to think things
over, and to get a right perspective,' he said, 'and our home will be yours until you do.'

"We drove home the next day, up a wonderful river valley, deep into the heart of the foothills,
with the blue mountains always beckoning and receding before us. Mrs. Arthurs was as surprised
and delighted as he had been, and I won't try to tell you all the things she said to me. She
cried a little, too, and I'm afraid I came near helping her a bit. You know the Arthurs lost
their little girl before they left Manitoba, and they have had no other children. They both
seemed just hungry.

"There's nothing so very fine about their home, except the spirit that's inside it. I can't
describe it, but it's there--a certain leisurely way of doing things, a sense that they have
made work their servant instead of their master. And still they're certainly not lazy, and
they've accomplished more than we have. When they left Manitoba in the early days, discouraged
with successive frosts, they came right out here into the foothills with their few head of
stock. Now their cattle are numbered in thousands, and they have about a township of land.
And still they seem to live for the pure happiness they find in life, and only to think of
their property as a secondary consideration.

"Now I really must close. Mrs. Arthurs sends a note, and I'm quite sure it's an invitation.
Oh, mother, what could be lovelier! Now don't say you can't. Father has plenty of money; let
him hire a housekeeper for a while. The change will do him good.

"Love to you, dearest, and to Allan, if he still thinks of me.

"BEULAH.

"P.S.--I forgot to mention that Jim Travers left Plainville on the same train as I did. He
could hardly believe his eyes when he saw me there. I told him I was going West on a visit,
but I don't know how much he guessed. Said he was going West himself to take up land, but he
wanted to call on some friends first, and he got off a few stations from Plainville. Between
you and me, I believe he changed his plan so that the incident--our being on the train together,
you know--could not be misunderstood if the neighbours got to know of it. It would be just
like Jim to do that."

With Beulah's letter was a short but earnest note from Lilian Arthurs, assuring the mother
of her daughter's welfare, and pressing an invitation to spend the autumn in the glorious scenery
and weather of the foothill country. Mary Harris read both letters over again, with frequent
rubbing of her glasses. Love for her daughter, desire to see her old friend once more, and
growing dissatisfaction with conditions at home, all combined to give weight to the invitation
so earnestly extended. "If I only could!" she said to herself. "If I only could! But it would
cost so much."

The dinner was late that day, and Harris was in worse humour than usual. He had just broken
a plough-beam, which meant an afternoon's delay and some dollars of expense. When he had started
his meal his wife laid the full envelope before him. "A letter from Beulah," she said.

Without a word he rose from the table, took the letter in his hand, and thrust it into the
kitchen range. A blue flame slowly cut round the envelope; the pages began to curl like dry
leaves in autumn, and presently the withered ghost of the missive shrank away in the dull glare
of the coal fire behind.

CHAPTER XI

THE PRICE OF "SUCCESS"

At last the ploughing was finished, and, although the rich smell of wheat in the milk filled
the air, it still would be almost a month before the ripening crops were ready for the binder.
Harris felt that he could now allow himself a breathing spell, and that the opportunity to
investigate the rich lands of the Farther West was at hand. Many nights, while Mary milked
the cows, he had walked over to Riles', and the two had discussed their forthcoming venture
until they had grown almost enthusiastic over it. Riles, it must be said, was the leading spirit
in the movement; although already possessed of sufficient land and means to keep him in comfort
through his advancing years, the possibility of greater wealth, and particularly of wealth
to be had without corresponding effort, was a lure altogether irresistible. And Harris fell
in with the plan readily enough. A quarter of a century having elapsed since his former homesteading,
he was now eligible again to file on free Government land; Allan could do the same, and, by
also taking advantage of the purchase of script, it was possible to still further increase
their holdings. In addition to all this, Riles had unfolded a scheme for staking two or three
others on free homestead land: it would be necessary, of course, to provide them with "grub"
and a small wage during the three years required to prove up, but in consideration of these
benefactions the titles to the land, when secured, were to be promptly transferred to Riles
and Harris. This was strictly against the law, but the two pioneers felt no sense of crime
or shame for their plans, but rather congratulated themselves upon their cunning though by
no means original scheme to evade the regulations.

Harris found the task of disclosing his intentions to his wife more unpleasant than he would
have supposed, and it took him some days to make up his mind to broach the subject. He felt
that he was doing what was for the best, and that his business judgment in the matter could
hardly be challenged; and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that his wife would not fall
in with his plans. Application that it would be firmly save she to the hutment as Johnson'part'Material.

"Put up your gun, you (equally unprintable)," shouted the lumber-jack, throwing his hat on
the floor, "and I'll crack your slats quicker'n you can count 'em."

"It's all right, Pete," said the bar-tender, addressing the lumber-jack. "You can lick him
hands down, but that won't pay the bills if you get in the road of a bullet. Now you," turning
to the other, "stow that artillery, an' stow it quick, or I'll call the Mounted Police."

For answer the stranger took a handful of tobacco from his mouth, and with a swing of his arm
plastered it over the mirror behind the bar. "That for the Mounted Police," he said. "Now there's
goin' t' be some drinkin' or some shootin', an' maybe a little o' both." He ploughed the floor
with another bullet, and the crowd again visibly thinned away. Riles had backed into a corner;
the man in the pepper-and-salt suit had disappeared.

Having no weapon, the lumber-jack kept his distance, but if epithets could kill his bullying
provoker would have been carried out a corpse. The man with the revolver, on the other hand,
seemed taking his time, playing with his victim, like a wild beast sure of his prey.

Suddenly there was another stir about the door, and a young fellow in scarlet tunic and yellow-striped
riding-pants walked briskly in. His lithe figure, his clean boyish face, his military alertness,
were in striking contrast to the ambling, carelessly-dressed crowd. He had taken in the situation
at a glance, and walked, neither faster nor slower, direct to the desperado. The latter found
himself confronted by an unexpected dilemma. If he took his gun off the lumber-jack to cover
the policeman he knew perfectly well that the promised slat-cracking process would begin immediately.
If the policeman had only stood at the door and ordered him to put up his gun, or parleyed,
or thought of his skin as a policeman should, he would have had time to plan his campaign.
But this boy in scarlet was a revelation of something new in policemen. It was only eight steps
from the door to where the outlaw stood, and those eight steps at parade pace occupied about
three seconds. The gentleman from Montana was quick enough with his gun, but not particularly
nimble in intellect, and he never faced a situation quite like this before. What was this policeman
going to do, anyway? Would he never stop and deliver his ultimatum? He had not even drawn his gun!

By this time the policeman was beside him. He did not seize him, nor shout at him, nor menace
him in any way, yet somewhere in his manner and bearing was a sense of irresistible power.

"Perhaps you don't know that it's against the law to flourish a revolver in this country,"
he said. "Better let me keep it for you until you are leaving town."

"Against the law!" said the ruffian, now recovering himself. "That's a good one. Why, ever'thin'
I've done for twenty years has been against the law. I cracked up the law for chicken-grit
years ago."

"Not the Canadian law," said the Mounted Policeman. "You'll only offend against it once, and
it won't be the law that gets cracked."

"Thas' so?" sneered the other. "Then what'll happen?"

"I'll arrest you."

"You? I could eat you in three bites. I can lick you with one hand."

"How many like me do you think you could lick?" asked the policeman, with imperturbable composure.

The man from Montana had removed his eye from the lumber-jack, who was now dancing about in
menacing attitudes.

"Forget it, Pete," ordered the policeman. "Now, how many like me can you lick?"

"About six," said the other, speaking with much deliberation.

"All right," said Sergeant Grey. "Then my chief would send seven. Now, will you come with me
or wait for the seven? By the way," he continued, "the lock-up is a sort of beastly place to
stow a man, especially when he's visiting the country for the first time. I think I'll let
you sleep here, on your promise to appear in court at ten to-morrow morning. Let me help you
to your room. But first, I'll have to trouble you for your gun."

"What if I clear out through the night?"

"You won't--not very far." There was a metallic ring in the last words that penetrated the
shell of the man who had made a business of breaking law for twenty years, and he finally handed
over his revolver.

"Search me if I know why I do it," he said, turning to the bar-tender. "I could eat that kid
in three bites."

"Yes," said the man behind. "But you couldn't digest the whole British Empire, and that's what
you've got to do if you start nibbling on any part of it. Besides, he mightn't make as easy
chewin' as you think. You'd find him more brisket than sirloin when you get your teeth into
him. I've seen him throw an' handcuff a bigger man than you right in this room, an' never turn
a hair in doin' it. An' take it from me, stranger, what he says about sendin' seven if the
job's too big for six is gospel, an' the quicker you get that in your block the safer your
hide'll be in Canada."

Sharp at ten the next morning the man who made a business of breaking the law appeared before
the magistrate, paid a fine of fifty dollars, and surrendered his weapon to the King's officers
for good. When he returned to the hotel and demanded his bill for the night's lodging he was
surprised to learn he had none.

"Sergeant Grey settled for you," said the clerk with a faint smile. "Said you were his guest
last night."

It was the first time in a long experience that he had found that law could be rigorous and
yet absolutely just. It upset his whole crude philosophy of his relation to society and the
State, and stretched before him the straight and easy road to citizenship.

To return to the scene of the night before. When the bar-room had settled down to normal, and
no one showed a disposition to do any general buying, Riles betook himself to his room. He
had just got into bed when a knock came at the door.

"Who's there?" he demanded.

"Gen'l'man to see Mr. Riles," said the porter.

"Well, shoot 'im in. The door ain't locked," said Riles, in considerable wonderment as to who
his visitor might be.

The door opened, and a well-dressed man of average height, with carefully combed hair and clean-shaven
face, save for a light moustache, stood revealed in the uncertain glow of the match with which
Riles was endeavouring to find his lamp. His visitor was a man of twenty-eight or thirty years,
with clear eyes and well-cut face, and yet with some subtle quality in his expression that
implied that under his fair exterior lay a deep, cunning, and that he was a man not to be trusted
in matters where his own interests might be at stake.

"Hello, Hiram," he said quietly. "You didn't figure on seeing me here, did you?"

At first glance Riles did not recognize him, and he raised the oil lamp to turn the light better
on the stranger's face.

"Well, if it ain't Gardiner!" he exclaimed. "Where in Sam Hill did you come from?"

"It's a big country, Hiram," he said with a touch of bitterness, "but not big enough for a
fellow to lose himself in." He sat down on the side of the bed and lit a cigar, tendering another
to Riles, and the two men puffed in silence for a few minutes.

"Yes, I've hit a lot of trail since I saw you last," he continued, "and when you're in the
shadow of the Rockies you're a long piece from Plainville. How's the old burg? Dead as ever?"

"About the same," said Riles. "You don't seem t' be wastin' no love on it."

"Nothing to speak of," said the other, slowly flicking the ash from his cigar. "Nothing to
speak of. You know I got a raw deal there, Hiram, and it ain't likely I'd get enthusiastic
over it."

"Well, when a fellow gets up against the law an' has t' clear out," said Riles, with great
candour, "that's his funeral. As for me, I ain't got nothin' agen Plainville. You made a little
money there yourself, didn't you?"

The younger man leaned back and slowly puffed circles of fragrant smoke at the ceiling, while
Riles surveyed him from the head of the bed. He had been a business man in Plainville, but
had become involved in a theft case, and had managed to escape from the town simply because
a fellow-man whom he had wronged did not trouble to press the matter against him. Riles' acquaintance
with him had not been close; except in a business way they had moved in other circles, and
he was surprised and a little puzzled that Gardiner should find him out on the first night
of his presence in the New West.

Gardiner showed no disposition to reopen the conversation about Plainville, so at last Riles
asked, "How d'you know I was here?"

"Saw your scrawl on the register," he said, "and I've seen it too often on wheat tickets to
forget it. Thought I'd look you up. Maybe can be of some service to you here. What are you
chasing--more land?"

"Well, I won't say that, exactly, but I kind o' thought I'd come out and look over some of
this stuff the Gover'ment's givin' away, before the furriners gets it all. Guess if there's
any-thin' free goin' us men that pioneered one province should get it on the next."

"You don't learn anything, Riles, do you? You don't know anything more about making money than
you did twenty years ago."

"Well, maybe I don't, and maybe I do, but I can pay my way, an' I can go back t' Plainville
when I like, too."

"Don't get hot," said Gardiner, with unshaken composure. "I'm just trying to put you wise to
yourself. Don't make any difference to me if you spend your whole life sod-busting; it's your
life--spend it any way you like. But it's only men who don't know any better that go on to
the land nowadays. It's a lot easier to make a living out of farmers than out of farming."

"Well, p'r'aps so, but that's more in your line. I never--"

"That's just what I say--you never learn. Now look at me. I ain't wearing my last suit, nor
spending my last dollar, either, and I haven't done what you'd call a day's work since I came
West. There's other things so much easier to do."

"Meanin'?--"

"Oh, lots of things. Remittance men, for instance. These woods are full of them. Chaps that
never could track straight in the old ruts, and were sent out here where there aren't any ruts
at all. They're not a bad bunch; brought up like gentlemen, most of 'em; play the piano and
talk in three or four languages, and all that kind of stuff, but they're simply dangerous with
money. So when it comes to hand, in the public interest they have to be separated from it."

"Sounds interestin'," said Riles.

"'Tis, too, especially when one of 'em don't take to the treatment and lays for you with a
gun. But my hair's all there. That's what comes of wearing a tall hat."

"Tell me," said Riles, his face lit up with interest, "how d'ye do it?"

"'Twouldn't do you any good," said Gardiner. "You've steered too many plough-handles to be
very nimble with your fingers. But there's often other game to be picked up, if a man knows
where to look for it."

"Well, I wisht I knew," Riles confessed. "Not anythin' crooked, y' know, but something like--well,
something like you're doin'. I've worked hard for ev'ry nickel I ever made, an' I reckon if
there's easy money goin' I've a right t' get some of it."

"Now you're beginning to wake up. Though, mind you, some of it isn't as easy as it looks. You've
got to know your business, just like farming or anything else. But you can generally land something
to live on, even if it ain't a big stake. Take me now, for instance. I ain't doing anything
that a preacher mightn't do. Happened to fall in with a fellow owns a ranch up the river here.
Cleaned him empty one night at cards--stood him up for his last cent, and he kind o' took a
notion to me. Well, he's the son of a duke or an earl, or some such thing, and not long ago
the Governor goes and dies on him, leaving him a few castles and bric-a-brac like that and
some wagon-loads of money. So he had to go home for the time being, and as he wanted someone
to run his ranch, who should he think of but me. Suppose he thought if I happened to bet it
at poker some night I wouldn't lose it, and that's some consideration. He's got a thousand
acres or so of land up there, with a dozen cayuses on it, and he gives me twenty-five pounds
a month, with board and lodging and open credit at the Trading Company, to see that it doesn't
walk away in his absence. Besides that, I hire a man to do the work, and charge his wages up
in the expenses. Got a good man, too--one of those fellows who don't know any better than work
for a living. By the way, perhaps you know him--comes from Plainville part--Travers his name is?"

"Sure," said Riles. "He worked for Harris, until they had a row and he lit out. It kind o'
balled Harris up, too, although he'd never admit it. If he'd Travers there it'd be easier for
him t' get away now."

"Where's Harris going?"

"He ain't goin'; he's comin'. Comin' out here in a few days after me. I'm his kind o' advance
guard, spyin' out the land."

"You don't say? Well, see and make him come through with the expenses. If I was travelling
for Jack Harris I wouldn't be sleeping in a hen-coop like this. He's worth yards of money,
ain't he?"

"Oh, some, I guess, but perhaps not so much more'n his neighbours."

"Nothing personal, Riles. You've got to get over that narrowness if you're going to get into
the bigger game I've been telling you about. I don't care how much you're worth--how much is
Harris bringing with him?"

"Couple of hundred dollars, likely."

"I wouldn't show my hand for that. How much can he raise?"

"Well, supposin' he sold the old farm--"

"Now don't do any reckless supposing. Will he sell the farm?"

"Sure, he'll sell it if he sees something better."

"How much can he get for it?"

"Thirty or forty thousand dollars."

"That's more like a stake. Hiram, it's up to you and me to show him something better--and to
show it to him when he's alone...You're tired to-night. Sleep it out, and we'll drive over
to the ranch to-morrow together. We ought to pick something better than a homestead out of this."

CHAPTER XIII

SETTING THE TRAP

Notwithstanding the exhaustion occasioned by his journey Riles was early about. The hotel bed
was strange to him, and the noises that floated up from the bar-room interrupted his slumbers.
At least, he told himself it was the noises, but the fact is a great new thought had been sown
in his brain, and had started the cells whirling in dizzy speculation. The unexpected meeting
with Gardiner, the latter's evident prosperity, and his frank contempt for men who made their
living by labour, had left a deep impression upon Riles. He had no idea by what means Gardiner
proposed that they should possess themselves of Harris's money, and he felt some doubt about
any such attempt being rewarded with success. Nevertheless, Gardiner seemed to think the matter
a simple one enough, and Gardiner's good clothes and good cigars were evidence of his ability
to carry his plans into effect.

The streets had not yet assumed their morning activity when Riles emerged from the hotel, but
the unclouded Alberta sunshine was bathing every atom of out-of-doors in a warmth and brilliance
that might have found, and in very truth did find, a keen response in the inanimate objects
of its affection. The jubilant laugh of running mountain water rippled through the quiet air,
fragrant with the perfume of balm-of-Gilead and balsam; to the eastward the sunshine poured
into broad valleys of undulating, sweeping plain, and in the west the great mountains, clad
in their eternal robes of white, loomed silent and impressive in their majesty. Even Riles
stopped to look at them, and they stirred in him an emotion that was not altogether profane--a
faint, undefined consciousness of the puniness of man and the might of his Creator. No one
can live for long in the presence of the mountains without that consciousness, and it is a
great day for the mountain-dweller when he learns to distinguish between the puniness of man,
the animal, and the infinity of man, the thinking soul. Riles breakfasted as soon as the dining-room
was opened, eating his meal hurriedly, as he always did, albeit the French-fried potatoes,
to which he was unaccustomed, could be poised on his knife only with considerable effort. Then
he sat down in an arm-chair on the shady side of the hotel to wait for Gardiner. He had suddenly
lost his interest in the free lands which had been the purpose of his journey.

His wait was longer than he had expected, and he broke it several times by strolls about the
little town. In size it was much the same as Plainville, but that was the chief point of resemblance.
True, it had its typical stores, selling everything from silks to coal oil; its blacksmiths'
shops, ringing with the hammer of the busy smith on ploughshare or horseshoe; its implement
agencies, with rows of gaudily-painted wagons, mowers, and binders obstructing the thoroughfare,
and the hempen smell of new binder twine floating from the hot recess of their iron-covered
storehouses; a couple of banks, occupying the best corners, and barber shops and pool-rooms
in apparent excess of the needs of the population. All these he might have found in Plainville,
but there were here in addition half-a-dozen real estate offices, with a score or more curbstone
dealers, locaters, commission-splitters, and go-betweens, and the number and size of the livery
stables gave some clue to the amount of prospecting going on from this base of supplies. The
streets were lined with traffic. Riles estimated that in two hours as many teams passed him
as might be seen in Plainville in a week; long rows of box-cars were unloading on the side
tracks; farmers' effects and household goods of every description were piled in great heaps
about the railway yards; while horses, cattle, pigs, and poultry contributed to the dust and
din of the settlers' operations. Great wagons of lumber were being loaded at the lumber yards,
and an unbroken procession of wagons and farm machinery of every description was wending its
way slowly into the distance where lay hope of home or fortune for the new settler.

It was almost noon when Gardiner appeared on the scene. "You don't hurt you'self in the mornin's,"
was Riles' greeting.

"Don't need to," he answered cheerily. "Besides, I'd a long session after I left you last night.
No, no particulars at present. I told you you had spoiled your hands for that kind of work.
How d'ye like this air? Isn't that something worth breathing?"

"Good enough," said Riles, "but I didn't come out here for air."

"No, you came for land. I'm surprised you're not out bouncing over the prairie in a buckboard
long before this."

Riles shot a quick glance at Gardiner. But he was puffing a cigar and drinking in the warm
sunshine with obvious satisfaction.

"So I might o' been, but I thought we kind o' made a date last night, didn't we?"

"Did we? Oh yes; now I remember. But I thought perhaps you'd feel different about it in the
morning. A man generally does. I won't hold you to anything you said last night, Riles."

Riles could not recall that he had said anything that committed him in any way, but Gardiner's
tone implied that plainly enough.

"I ain't changed my mind," he said, "but I don't know's I said anything bindin', did I? I thought
we was goin' t' drive out t' your place t'-day an' talk things over."

"Well, I just didn't want you to lose any time over me if you thought things wouldn't work
out," said Gardiner. "It takes more nerve, you know, than hoeing potatoes. But you're welcome
to the hospitality of the ranch, in any case. I came in on horseback, so we'll get a team at
one of the stables and drive out."

In a short time they were on their way. The road skirted the river, threading its way through
the narrow belt of cotton-woods and evergreens that found footing in the moist soil of the
valley. Here and there, through an opening in the trees, or across a broad wedge of prairie,
could be seen the mountains, now bathed in a faint purple, silently receding before them. A
soft breeze, neither hot nor cold, but moist and fresh from the great table-lands of snow,
pressed gently about the travellers, but their thoughts were of neither the scenery nor the
weather.

"It's all right, Riles," Gardiner was saying. "If you're prepared to stay with the deal we
can pull it through--no doubt about that. That is, if Harris will sell his farm and come out
here with the cash in his jeans. If he won't do that, you better get busy on your homestead
proposition right away."

"He'll do it all right, if he sees somethin' worth while. But Harris's no spring chicken, an'
you'll have t' show him somethin' t' his likin' before he loosens up."

"I don't care whether he loosens up or not," said Gardiner. "All I care is that he brings the
money, and brings it in bills. No cheques, mind you. Get him out here with the cash on him,
and I'll do the loosening up, if it comes to that."

Riles was somewhat alarmed at the sinister turn of the conversation. He had no compunction
about getting the better of his old neighbour, the man who had entrusted him with the discharge
of their joint mission, but he had considerable respect for the force, if not the principle,
of the law.

"You don't mean that you'd do anythin'--anythin' that wasn't right?" he said. "I wouldn't want
t' get mixed up in no scrape, y' know."

"You mean that you think more of your skin than you do of Harris's coin. Well, there's no accounting
for tastes. But as for doing anything wrong--you ought to know me better than that. It will
all be clean and above board, and no violence if it can be helped, but if Harris is unfortunate
nobody's to blame for that. Of course, if you're afraid to take a sportsman's chance for a
half of forty thousand dollars, call the deal off. I've got lots of other fish to fry."

"You don't understand," said Riles. "I ain't a'scared, but I don't want t' do nothin' that'll
get us into trouble. Harris is an old neighbour o' mine, an'--"

"I understand perfectly. You wouldn't mind a piece of Harris's money served on a platter and
wrapped in tissue paper, but you want somebody else to take the chances. Now, there won't be
any chances to speak of, but what there are you take your share. If that's a bargain it's a
bargain, and if it isn't we'll talk about the weather. What d'you say?"

"It's a bargain," said Riles, "provided your plan'll work out."

"It's got to work out. It's like going up in a balloon--if it doesn't work out it's all off
with the engineer. You got to take the chance, Hiram, and then make good on the chance."

Riles chewed vigorously at his tobacco. "Explain how you're goin' to pull it off," he said,
"an' then I'll tell you yes or no."

"Not on your life," said Gardiner. "I don't show my hand until I know who's sitting across."

There was silence for half a mile, while Riles turned the matter over in his mind. He was naturally
a coward, but he was equally a money-grabber, and it was one instinct against the other. Avarice
won it, and at length he extended his hand to Gardiner. "I'm in on anythin' you're in on," he said.

"That sounds like it," said Gardiner, with enthusiasm. "Now the whole thing's simple as A B
C, and not half as dangerous as running a traction engine or breaking a broncho. It all rests
on getting him out here with the money, and that's where you come in. I don't mind telling
you if it wasn't for the help you can give there I'd handle the job myself, and save dividing
the proceeds."

"Yes, that's the point, all right," said Riles, somewhat dubiously. "How're we goin' t' get
him out here with all that money?"

"Think, Riles," said Gardiner, puffing complacently at a fresh cigar. "Think hard."

Riles wrinkled his forehead and spat copiously at the front hub, but the inspiration would
not come. "I give it up," he said at last. "You'll have t' plan it, an' I'll carry it out."

"That's what comes of hard work, Hiram; you lose all your imagination. Right now you haven't
any more imagination than a cabbage. Now, I could suggest a dozen schemes to suit the purpose
if I had to, but one will do. Suppose this:

"These mountains up here are full of coal--more coal than can be burnt in a million years.
It's a bad road in, but once you get here you'll see it lying in seams, ten, fifteen, twenty
feet thick, and stretching right through the rocks as far as you like to follow it. That coal's
going to make a bunch of millionaires some day, but not until you can get at it with something
bigger than a cayuse. But railroads come fast in this country, and there's no saying how soon
a man might cash in if he invested just now."

"You ain't goin't' wait till a railroad comes, are you? We'll like enough be dead by that time."

"Hiram, I told you you had no imagination, wait a moment. Now, suppose that some strange eccentric
chap owns one of these coal limits. He lives up in the mountains, a kind of hermit, but we
fall in with him and offer him forty thousand dollars for his limit, worth, say, half a million,
or more if you feel like it. He says, 'All right, but mind I want the money in bills, and you'll
have to bring it out to me here.' Now can you think of anything?"

"Harris don't know nothin' about coal," protested Riles. "He wouldn't bite at anythin' like that."

"Your faith has been neglected as well as your imagination. You've got to paint it to him so's
to get him interested. That's all. Our business is to get Harris, with the money in his wallet,
started up into those mountains. It's mighty lonely up there, with timber wolves, grizzly bears,
precipices, snow-slides, and trails that lead to nowhere, and if Harris is unfortunate--well,
he's unfortunate."

The plan gradually penetrated Riles' slow-working mind. At first it numbed him a little, and
his face was a strange colour as he turned to his companion, and said, in a low voice, "Ain't
it risky? What if the police catch on?"

"They won't. They're all right for cleaning up a rough-house, but don't cut any figure in fine
art work like we'll put over. I tell you, Riles, it's absolutely safe. Of course, ordinary
precautions must be taken, same as you would with a vicious horse or any other risk you might
run. The main thing is to see that he has the money in bills; anything else would be risky
and lead to trouble. Then this fellow that's supposed to own the mine must be kept in the background.
We--"

"But who does own the mine?"

Gardiner made a gesture of exasperation. "You don't get me, Hiram. Nobody owns the mine. That
part of it's all a myth--a fairy tale manufactured because we need it. But Harris mustn't find
that out--not, at any rate, until it's too late. Then if anything ever does leak out, suspicion
will be directed toward some mysterious mine-owner, and the police will be wearing out shoe-leather
hunting the cracks in the foothills while you and I are taking in the sights of Honolulu or
South America. We'll quietly make an appointment for Harris to meet the mine-owner somewhere
up in the hills. We'll direct him where to go, and leave it at that. Of course we won't go
with him; we'll have other business about that time."

Riles looked at Gardiner with frank admiration. It seemed so simple now, and in his growing
enthusiasm he felt that he would have little difficulty in persuading Harris to raise all the
cash possible and bring it with him. And it seemed so safe. As Gardiner said, the mountains
were full of danger, and if something should happen to Harris--well, he would be unfortunate;
but lots of other people had been unfortunate, too.

Gardiner turned his team down a side road, forded the river, climbed a steep, slippery bank,
and drew up beside a cluster of ranch buildings sheltered with cotton-woods and spruces. The
old, long log-house, reminiscent of the days when the West was a land and a law unto itself,
might have stirred the heart of poet or artist; the hard-beaten soil of the corral hinted still
of the brave days of the open range and cattle beyond the counting. As the team, in their long,
steady trot, swung up beside the stables, an alert young fellow came quickly out and busied
himself with the unhitching.

"Guess you ought to know our visitor, Jim, shouldn't you?" said Gardiner. "Another Manitoban
chasing the free land."

Travers at once recognized Riles and extended his hand. "Well, Mr. Riles, we weren't looking
for you here, although I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, for there was some talk of your
coming West before I left Plainville. What do you think of it? And did you see the mountains
this morning? Worth the trip themselves, aren't they?"

"Look pretty good, all right, Jim," said Riles, with an attempt at affability, "but I reckon
you wouldn't grow much wheat on 'em, an' scenery's not very fillin'. How you makin' it go you'self?"

"Nothing but luck since I landed," said Jim. "Got a good homestead and a good job right away.
You must let me take you out to my farm before you go back. How's everybody? Harrises well,
I hope?"

"Guess they're well enough, but gettin' kind o' scattered for a family group. Beulah lit out
when you did--but I guess I can't give you no information about that."

The smile did not depart from Travers' face, but if Riles had known him as well as he should
he would have seen the sudden smouldering light in the eye. But the young man answered quietly,
"I saw Beulah the day I left Plainville, and I understood she was going West on a visit. She
isn't back yet?"

"Innocent, ain't chuh?" said Riles, in a manner intended to be playful. "It's all right; I
don't blame you. Beulah's a good girl, if a bit high falutin, an' a few years' roughin' it
on the homestead'll take that out of her."

But Jim had dropped the harness and stood squarely facing Riles. The smile still lingered on
his lips, but even the heavy-witted farmer saw that he had been playing with fire. Riles was
much the larger man of the two, but he was no one to court combat unless the odds were overwhelmingly
in his favour. He carried a scar across his eye as a constant reminder of his folly in having
once before invited trouble from a younger man.

"What do you mean?" demanded Travers. "Put it in English."

But Gardiner interposed. "Don't be too sensitive, Jim," he said. "Riles has forgotten his parlour
manners, but he doesn't mean any harm. You weren't insinuating anything, were you, Hiram?"

"Course not," said Riles, glad of an opportunity to get out of the difficulty without a direct
apology. "No offence intended, Jim. Beulah's all right, an' you're all right, an' that's what
I always said."

Travers was not in the least deceived as to Riles' high-mindedness, but he realized that the
man was the guest of his employer, and he decided not to press the point. Gardiner and Riles
went to the house, and Jim presently saddled his own horse and rode out on the prairie. He
had already lunched, and it was Gardiner's custom to cook for himself when at home.

Inside, the two men were soon seated at a meal which Gardiner hastily but deftly prepared.
They ate from plates of white enamelled ware, on a board table covered with oilcloth, but the
food was appetizing, and the manner of serving it much more to Riles' liking than that to which
he had been subjected for some days. The meat was fresh and tasty; and the bread and butter
were all that could be desired, and the strong, hot tea, without milk but thick with sugar,
completed a meal that was in every way satisfactory. Riles' eyes, when not on his plate, were
busy taking in the surroundings. The log walls were hung with mementoes, some of earlier days
and some of other lands, and throughout the big room was a strange mixture of elegance and
plainness. At one end were rows of shelves, with more books than Riles had ever seen, and above
stood a small piece of statuary worth the price of many bushels of wheat.

Gardiner noted the interest of his guest, and smiled quietly to himself. He supposed that Riles
had the usual notions about the Far West--a notion that here he was on the outer-most rim of
the finer civilization of even the Middle West. But he knew also that this plain log building
contained furnishings and decorations altogether beyond anything that Riles had ever seen or
heard of--things, indeed, so far removed from the life of the hard-working farmer that they
might have come from another world than his own. When the meal was finished Gardiner swept
the soiled dishes into a big galvanized iron tub, there to await attentions from Jim at a convenient
season, and invited Riles to look about the house.

They entered another room, immediately to the north of the large apartment which served all
general housekeeping purposes. The floor was of plain boards, smooth with the riding-boots
of many years, and in the centre lay the skin of a great bear. An old-fashioned carved table,
of some size, and three leather chairs, were the principal furniture. Two swords hung diagonally
across the far wall, and above them was an old flag, discoloured with sun and rain. Ancient
firearms decorated the walls, and odd pieces of strange clothing hung about in profusion.

"This is His Nibs' drawing-room," said Gardiner. "This junk you see about you has been gathered
from the corners of the earth during the last few centuries. In there"--indicating another
room through a door to the left--"is his bedroom--a regular museum of stuff running to no end
of money, if you went to buy it. He has a couple of pictures worth more than a quarter-section
of land, and that mat you see through the door--a prayer-rug he calls it, though he don't use
it much for that--is worth over five hundred dollars."

Gardiner enjoyed the look of amazement that slowly spread over Riles' face. "He's been stuffin'
you," said Riles at length, thinking of his own extravagance when he paid ninety cents a yard
for a carpet for their front room at home. "He's been stuffin' you sure. There ain't no mats
worth any money like that."

"It's gospel," said Gardiner. "Why, man, he has a set of chess worth more than the best team
on your farm, and that statue affair up there--you simply couldn't buy it. The place is just
bristling with valuables of one kind and another."

But Riles appeared suddenly agitated. He seized Gardiner by the arm, saying, "If this stuff's
worth's much as you figure, why don't we make a clean-up here, when the duke, or whatever he
is, is away? That'd be safer, wouldn't it?"

"No, it wouldn't. It'd be easy enough to get away with the stuff, but how'd you turn it into
money? The police would get you sure on a game like that. Of course, if you should decide to
go in for culture, without the 'agri' ahead, you might like to have the prayer-mat for your
own knees. No, you can't put over anything like that. And now we better be getting down to
business."

Gardiner drew a couple of chairs up to the carved table, opened a drawer, and produced writing
materials. "We can't get a letter away to Harris any too soon. Nothing like making hay while
the sun shines, you know, and if he gets out here before we put our plan up to him, it would
be natural enough for him to want to see the mine-owner himself. So hitch yourself to that
pen there, and let us see what kind of a hand you are at fiction."

Riles would rather have done a day's work in the field than write a letter, but Gardiner insisted
it must be done by him. Much of the afternoon was spent in the struggle, and Gardiner's fertile
imagination had to be appealed to at several critical points. But at last the letter was completed.
It ran as follows:

"John Harris esq "planvil man

"sir i take up my pen to let you no that i am all well hoppin this will find you the same well
this is a grate contry their is sure a big out ov doors well mr Harris i think i see somthing

sell it to Him and make a killing dont fale

"your obedyunt servunt

"HIRAM RILES."

Gardiner read the letter carefully, suppressing his amusement over Riles' wrestlings with the
language, and finally gave his approval.

"Now, you must make a copy of it," he said. "It's only business to have a copy. That was a
fine touch of yours about going back to sell your own farm. I believe you have some imagination
after all, if it only had a chance to sprout."

Riles protested about the labour of making a copy, but Gardiner insisted, and at last the work
was completed. The sound of galloping hoofs was heard outside, and a cowboy from a neighbouring
ranch called at the door to ask if there was anything wanted from town. "Here's your chance
to mail your letter," Gardiner called to Riles with unnecessary loudness. "Mr. Riles dropped
in here to write a letter," he explained to the rider.

Having with much difficulty folded his epistle until it could be crumpled into an envelope.
Riles sealed, stamped, and addressed it, and a moment later the dust was rising down the trail
as the cowboy bore the fatal missive to town. The die was cast; the match had been set to the
tinder, and the fire must now burn through to a finish, let it scorch whom it would.

Gardiner took up the copy, folded it carefully, and put it in his pocket-book. "Now, Mr. Riles,"
he said, "we're in for this thing, and there's no backing out. At least you're in for it. You
have sent a letter, in your handwriting, such as it is, to Harris, and I have a copy of it,
in your handwriting, in my pocket. If this thing ever gets out these letters will make good
evidence."

CHAPTER XIV

THE GAMBLERS

Harris found some difficulty in providing that affairs of the farm would proceed satisfactorily
during his absence, but at last they were arranged, if not exactly to his liking, at least
in a manner that promised no serious loss. It was most unfortunate that Mary, in a moment of
headstrong passion quite without precedent in his experience of her, had determined upon a
visit just at the time when she was particularly needed at home. If Harris had been quite fair
he would have remembered that there had been no time in the last twenty-five years when she
had not been needed at home, and the present occasion was perhaps no less opportune for her
visit than many others. But he felt a deep grievance over his wife's conduct, and while he
missed her sorely he was determined that no act of his should shorten her visit or imply that
the business of the farm was in any way suffering from her absence. He had managed their affairs
successfully in the past; he would continue to manage them successfully in the future; and
he only hoped that time would impress upon her the fact that he was doing everything for the
best. He assured himself that he was actuated only by a desire for the highest good for his
family, even while their disobedience and ingratitude rendered his task unnecessarily difficult.

The hired man, in consideration of having no field work to do, finally consented to milk the
cows and deliver the milk daily to Mrs. Riles, who would convert it into butter--for a consideration
of so much per pound. To his good neighbours, the Grants, Harris turned for assurance that
should he and Allan be delayed on their trip, or should the harvest come in earlier than expected,
ample steps would be taken to garner it.

So, with these arrangements complete, the farmer and his son drove into Plainville one fine
bright morning at the end of July, ready for their first long trip into the New West. Indeed,
it was Allan's first long journey anywhere; an excursion to Winnipeg at the time of the summer
exhibition had been the limit of his experience of travel, and the hard work of the farm had
not yet extinguished the young man's desire for novelty and excitement. He looked forward to
their expedition with a feeling akin to enthusiasm, and he secretly cherished the hope that
their travels might bring them again into the company of his mother and sister, for whom, with
the slackening of labour, he now felt an increasing loneliness.

Harris got off at the railway station to buy the tickets; Allan went to the post office on
the odd chance of any letters awaiting delivery, and the hired man turned the horses homeward.
The station agent was threading his way through his car report, and remained provokingly unconscious
of Harris's presence at the ticket window. The farmer took no pains to conceal his impatience,
coughing and shuffling obviously, but it was not until the last box-car had been duly recorded
that the agent deigned to recognize his existence.

"Nothing for you from--," he said, mentioning the mail order house from which Harris made most
of his purchases.

"Well, I didn't expect anythin'," retorted the farmer, "although you're just as likely to have
it when I don't as when I do. How much is a ticket to Calgary?"

"You got the land fever, too?" the agent asked, as he consulted his tariffs. "Riles went up
the other day. You'll be making a clean-up on the cheap land, I suppose. But I tell you, Harris,
if I'd a farm like yours you couldn't pry me off it with a pinch-bar. No more worries for little
Willie, and I'd leave the free land to those that haven't got any--like myself."

"Worry!" snorted Harris. "What do you worry about? You get your pay, whether it freezes or
hails or shrivels up with one of these Dakota scorchers."

The agent thought of the piles of reports on his table, but as he thumped the stamp on the
tickets he answered, "Oh, I worry over the Monroe doctrine." He left the farmer counting his
change, and turned to his reports. "Another money-grubber gone crazy with the heat," he muttered.
"If I'd his wad wouldn't I burn this wire with one hot, short sentence!"

Harris met his son on the platform. "What d'ye think, Dad? A letter from Riles." He drew the
crumpled missive from its envelope. "Looks like a laundry ticket," he said, "but I figured
it out, and he wants you to sell the farm and buy a coal mine."

Harris read the letter through, not without some difficulty. At first he was inclined to laugh,
but the earnestness of Riles impressed him through the makeshift English.

"What d'ye think of it, Dad?" said the younger man, at length. "Of course we don't know anything
about coal, but then--"

"It must look good to Riles or he wouldn't want to put any money in it," commented Harris,
after a few minutes' reflection. "Riles is pretty cautious. He's got money in the bank drawin'
three per cent; he's afraid to lend it out among the farmers. And he ain't easy talked into
a new scheme, either."

"D'ye suppose we could sell the farm?" The idea of a big, profitable speculation suddenly appealed
to Allan with much greater force than the prospect of three years on a homestead. He knew that
vast sums of money had been made, and made quickly, in the Far West, but he had never before
thought of himself or his father sharing in this sudden wealth. They had worked hard for their
money, and took it as a matter of course that they should continue to work hard for it. But
the vision of quick riches, the prospect of realizing it in his own person, the dizzy thought
that Fortune, which had seemed to move in a circle quite apart from his existence, might actually
now be within a hand's reach--these intoxicated him with a sudden hope which burst the old
bounds of his imagination and set up new and wilder ambitions.

"D'ye suppose we could sell the farm?" he repeated. It began to seem that the short-cut to
wealth hinged on the possibility of selling the farm.

"I guess we could sell it, all right," said Harris. "Maybe not for that much cash, but we can
get cash on the agreement, if we need it." He, too, found the inborn gaming instinct which
cries out for money without labour welling within him and surging up against his long-established,
sober judgment. But he was not a man to act precipitately, or risk all on a single throw unless
he were very, very sure of the result.

"Of course, maybe it's all right," he continued. "But it's a good thing to buy your buggy before
you throw away your cart. If this thing's as good as Riles says, it will keep until we can
see it for ourselves. If it don't, somethin' else'll turn up."

"Yes," said Allan, "but if we find it's all right when we get there, and we've only a few measly
hundred dollars along, we'll want to kick ourselves all the way home. Lots of fellows are making
big money just because they had some capital to work with, and why shouldn't we do it, too?
Couldn't you fix it some way to get the money without coming back, if everything looks all
right? That'd save time, and expense too."

"There's something in that. There's time to see Bradshaw yet before the train comes. We'll
kind o' leave it standin' in his hands."

They made a hurried call on Bradshaw, the lawyer, and asked him to be on the look-out for a
buyer for the farm.

"Mind, I'm not actu'lly puttin' it up for sale," Harris cautioned him, "but I want you to keep
your eye open for a buyer. Forty thousand dollars takes the whole thing as a goin' concern,
an' the more cash the better. Get a line on a buyer if you can, and if I send you word to sell,
see, you sell, and if I don't send you word, don't do anythin'. You understand?"

"I think I understand you perfectly," said the lawyer, who was also a dealer in real estate.
Indeed, since the activity in farm lands had commenced he might be said to be a real estate
dealer who was also a lawyer. "Not many buyers have that much ready cash, Mr. Harris, but it
could no doubt be arranged to sell your agreement, or raise a mortgage on the property, that
would give you the whole amount in your hand." Bradshaw, along with his other pursuits, was
agent for a mortgage company, and always valued two commissions higher than one.

The lawyer wrote something on a sheet of paper. "This is a power of attorney, which will enable
me to complete the documents without the delay of sending them to you, if you should decide
to sell," he explained. Harris signed the paper, and Allan witnessed it.

With this understanding the journey westward was undertaken, and completed without event of
importance. As his daughter had done a few weeks before, and his wife still later, Harris spent
a few hours in the young city just beginning to stir itself on the sleepy, sunny slopes where
the prairies ran into the foothills, stretching one last long tongue far up the valley of the
Bow and lapping at the feet of the eternal snows. His original plan had been to spend a day
or two in Calgary, "sizing up" the land situation for himself before joining Riles, but the
possibilities of the coal mine speculation had grown upon him with every mile of the journey.
He had only to use his ears to hear of so many men, apparently no more capable men than he
and Allan, who had grown suddenly rich from fortunate investments. It was a case of recognizing
the opportunity when it presented itself, and having the nerve to seize it without hesitation.
He found himself now in a country and an atmosphere where "playing safe" was somewhat to a
man's discredit--where the successful man was the man who dared to throw discretion to the
winds and take the chance. And because money, not earned in the country, was pouring in from
outside, and by its own buoyancy raising the price of land and labour, the chance, even the
foolish chance, was likely to turn out to advantage and justify the daring of the speculator
rather than the discretion of the careful buyer. Harris had, all his life, lived in an atmosphere
of conservatism, where saving a penny was greater merit than making two, but he was amazed
to find how quickly the gambling spirit of the new land seized upon him. Unlike Riles, he was
a man who responded to his environment; in a community of hard-working, money-saving farmers
he worked hardest and saved most; but in a community of reckless, unlicensed speculation he
had the qualities which would soon make of him the greatest gambler of them all. He was astonished
and somewhat frightened by this hitherto unrevealed side of his own character. His long-dormant
imagination began to revive; with imagination came hope and optimism; and hope and optimism,
unchecked, soon breed recklessness. He saw the evidence of prosperity on every side--not the
prosperity that hedges itself about with socialisms and affected dignity, but the prosperity
that stays on the job in its shirt-sleeves. He saw men who were doing big things--building
railways, opening up wildernesses, farming or carrying on business transactions on a scale
of which he had never dreamed--and he began to see that the only reason these men could do
these things was that they dared to do them. Well, he too--he and Allan--would dare some things...He
paid a dollar for their lunch without a grumble, and again they took the train.

Riles met them on the station platform. He had met every train for a week, as it had been agreed
that it would be better that the Harrises should not visit Gardiner's ranch until plans were
more fully developed. Jim was still there, and Gardiner insisted that Jim should not meet Harris
at present. He allowed Riles to think that he feared trouble if former employer and employee
should meet; as a matter of fact, he feared that if their coal mine proposition should reach
the ears of Travers the young man would attempt to dissuade Harris from having anything to
do with it, or at least would urge a fuller investigation than might be desirable. Besides,
he meant to make of Travers an unwitting party to the affair.

Riles, in overalls and shirt-sleeves, leaned against the iron rail at the back of the station
platform, his big hands stuffed in the bulging band of his trousers, and his under-jaw busy
with an ample ration of tobacco. He watched the passengers alighting from the train with little
interest; he had no particular expectations of meeting Harris on this occasion, and, if the
truth be told, he had little desire to meet him. Riles had no pangs of conscience over his
part in the plot against his old neighbour, but he had an uneasy feeling of cowardice. When
suddenly his eye fell on Harris and his big, strapping son, his first impulse was to slip away
in the crowd before they should notice him. But it was only for a moment; the next, Harris
was calling, "'Lo, Hiram," and the two were shaking hands as old friends met in a far country.

"Didja get my letter?" asked Riles, ignoring the commonplaces with which it was their custom
to introduce any important topic. "Didja sell the farm?"

"I got the letter, Hiram, but I didn't sell the farm. Thought we'd just have a look over this
coal mine before goin' into the business altogether."

"H-s-h. Throttle your voice down. This place is full of men on the look-out for somethin' like
that, an' you can't keep it too dark until it's all settled."

"Well, ain't we going to put up somewhere?" said Allan, breaking the silence that followed
Riles' warning. "There ought to be an Alberta hotel here, somewhere. I saw one in every town
for the last two hundred miles."

"I got that beat," said Riles, with a snicker. "Boardin' on a lord, or duke, or somethin'."

"Don't say?"

"Yeh. You mind Gard'ner? Him 'at lit out from Plainville after that stealin' affair?"

"The one you got credit for bein' mixed up in?" said Allan, with disconcerting frankness. "A
lame kind of a lord he'd make. What about him?"

"Well, he struck a soft thing out here, fo' sure. This lord I'm tellin' you about's gone off
home over some bloomin' estate or other, an' Gard'ner's runnin' his ranch--his 'bloody-well
rawnch' he calls it. Gets a good fat wad for ridin' round, an' hires a man to do the work.
But it was Gard'ner put me on t' this coal mine deal."

"Let's get settled first, and we'll talk about Gardiner and the mine afterwards," said Harris,
and they joined the throng that was now wending its way to the hotels.

"How's your thirst, Hiram?" inquired Harris, after he had registered.

"Pretty sticky," confessed Riles. "But they soak you a quarter to wash it out here."

"Well, I got a quarter."

"A quarter apiece, I mean."

"Well, I got a quarter apiece," said Harris. "Come on."

Riles followed, astonishment over Harris's sudden liberality, and misgiving as to how he himself
could avoid a similar expenditure, struggling for uppermost place in his mind.

"Pretty strong stuff they have here," he said, after Harris and Allan had "set 'er up" in turn.
"Keel you over if you don't watch it."

"Does taste kind o' snakey," said Harris. "Guess that's enough for this time. Now come upstairs
and tell us all about this deal you have on."

When the travellers had thrown off their coats and vests, and all were seated in the little
bedroom, Riles cleared his throat.

"Well, there ain't much t' tell yuh, more'n I said in m' letter," he started. "As I said, it's
Gard'ner you'll have t' thank for this thing, good or bad. I ain't a coal miner, an' I told
him that, an' I told him you wasn't neither, but he says that don't make no difference. He
says there's all kinds o' money in it, an' I reckon that's what we came out here for, ain't it?"

"Yes, provided the tiling's sound," said Harris. "Anyone can see with half an eye that there's
easier ways of makin' money than bustin' up this prairie sod for it. But you and me've worked
hard for what we've got, Hiram, and we want t' go mighty careful about spendin' it."

"I suppose you've sent home word to sell your farm, have you?" put in Allan. "You'll be chipping
in at the same time?"

"Oh, yes, I'll be chippin' in. Of course. But I didn't just say to sell the farm yet. I'll
have t' get back an' straighten things up some first. You see, I thought you'd get my letter
before you left, an' you could kind o' make your deal then, an' your payment would hold the
bargain bound until I could sell mine, y' see, Harris?" Riles was beginning to address himself
mainly to the older man.

"Don't take me up wrong," said Allan. "I'm in on this along with Dad, if he's in; an' if he's
out, I'm out. But I was just kind o' curious about it."

"It's all right, it's all right," assured Riles, with great magnanimity. Inwardly he was cursing
Gardiner for having left this task to him. He was suspicious of a trap in the simplest question,
and feared that any minute he might find himself floundering in a mesh of contradictions.

"Where is this coal mine, and who's got it?" said Harris.

"I ain't saw it myself," admitted Riles. "They're awful p'tic'lar about lettin' people see
it," he continued, with a sudden flash of inspiration. "It's so valu'ble, y' know."

"'Fraid somebody'll bring it home in their pocket, I suppose," said Allan.

Riles pretended to laugh heartily.

"But where is it?" insisted Harris. "Is there a railroad near, or how do you get at it?"

"It's up in the mountains, an' that's all I can tell you; but it's all right, an' there's a
pile o' money in it. I guess I better bring Gard'ner down in the morning, an' he'll explain
all about it. Y' see, he knows the fellow 'at owns it, an' I don't, an' he'll be able to tell
you. That is, if you're goin' in on it. Gard'ner won't say much unless he knows you're goin'
in on it."

"Well, he'll have to say a good deal before he knows," said Harris. "I ain't buyin' a pig in
a poke. He's got t' show me, and then if it's all right, why, it's all right."

"Oh, it's all right," said Riles, although inwardly he felt little enthusiasm over the attitude
of either father or son. He was annoyed that Allan should be present. On the whole, it would
be better to leave the rest of the explaining to Gardiner.

"What d'ye think of it, Dad?" said Allan, when Riles was gone.

"Maybe all right," said Harris. "Wouldn't be surprised but it is. At the same time, I ain't
goin' to put a cent in it till I'm dead sure. And anyway, there's no use lettin' Riles think
we're keen on it."

"That's what I think. You think Gardiner's all square in it?"

"I don't know. Likely he's getting a fat commission from somewhere, but that's fair enough,
if he makes the deal. But he won't see any o' our money till I have the opinion of the best
lawyer in town. That's all we can say till we see it."

"That seems safe," Allan agreed. "Just the same, I think there's lots more chances to use our
money to advantage here than down in Manitoba, don't you?"

"Yes, I think there is. You see, this is a new country, and everything on the jump. Think how
much we could 'a' made in Manitoba in the early days if we had the money and knew where t'
put it. Well, out here they've got the benefit of our experience, an' they'll do as much here
in five years as we did in twenty-five. We had t' make the money t' develop our country--had
t' make it right at home on our farms, an' that's slow. But here the money's rollin' in from
outside."

"What d'ye say if we sell the old farm anyway, and then if this mine business don't look good,
we'll plunk it into farm land?"

"Might do worse," his father agreed. "We'll have a look round for a day or two, anyway."

The next morning they began a round of the real estate offices. Great activity prevailed everywhere,
and dealers seemed to have hardly time to give them attention. In one little box of a place
they mentioned that they might be on the market for say a couple of thousand acres.

"Think I can fix you up all right," said the proprietor; "and there's one sure thing, you can't
put your money anywhere where it's safer or 'll grow faster. Why--"

At that moment a man in a pepper-and-salt suit went by the door.

"'Scuse me a minute," said the dealer, rushing to the door and sending a shrill whistle down
the street. The man in the pepper-and-salt turned, and the dealer beckoned him into the little
office.

"You know that five-thousand-acre block you bought last week," he said in a low voice, but
loud enough to be heard by the Harrises. "Bought it at six dollars, didn't you? Well, I can
give you seven to-day, for a quick sale."

"Couldn't think of it, my dear fellow," protested the lucky buyer. "I simply couldn't think of it."

"Couldn't think of making five thousand dollars in a week? It don't look too bad to a working
man like me."

"But it's nowhere near the value of the land. Why, they're selling stuff in Illinois today
that ain't to be compared with it at a hundred and fifty dollars an acre. It's only a question
of time until this is as much. You've got better land here, and better climate, and you're
a thousand miles nearer the Pacific Ocean, that's going to carry the commerce of the future.
Seven dollars? It's an insult to Canada to mention such a price."

"Well, say," continued the real estate man, in a still more confidential tone, "I was allowing
myself a little margin on the deal, even at seven dollars. But I had a man in here a few minutes
ago that'll buy that block at eight-fifty. I'll pay you eight dollars net to put it through."

"Sorry, but he'll have to get down deeper than that if he wants it. Tell him I might consider
ten dollars, but mind, I ain't making any promise." And the man in the pepper-and-salt suit
continued his course down the street, just the same as if he were not making five thousand
dollars a week.

"Big capitalist from New York, that fellow," explained the dealer. "Simply coining money up
here, and always salting it into more land."

The incident left a deep impression on the Harrises. They did not know, of course, that the
man in the pepper-and-salt suit always went by the door when likely-looking strangers were
in, and that he always refused a profit of ten thousand dollars as a matter of little consequence--except
for its influence on the unsuspecting party of the third part.

CHAPTER XV

THE LURE OF EASY MONEY

In the afternoon Gardiner and Riles drove into town and met the Harrises in the waiting-room
of the hotel. Gardiner's greeting was friendly, but not over-familiar, as became a man who
had recently suffered some reflection on his character. He shook Harris and Allan by the hand,
inquired after the cattle and the crops, but discreetly avoided family matters, having learned
from Riles that all had not been going smoothly in their domestic affairs. Gardiner knew a
little room at the back of the bar, to which he escorted his guests. Having ordered a bottle
and glasses on the table, he turned the key in the door.

"You can't be too careful," he explained. "You know, the walls have ears, and if it gets out
that this coal mine can be picked up at the price we have on it, it will be taken before night.
I understand your money is not here yet, Mr. Harris?"

"No. Not started, I guess. The fact is, I haven't sold the farm."

"Well, I don't want to hurry you, but we've got to act quickly, or not at all. Of course, we
don't figure on taking any chances. Our idea is to turn the property over at once, at a good
profit. That's the way you feel about it too, isn't it?"

"I'm not a coal miner."

"Exactly. Neither are the men who own most of the mines of this country. There comes a time,
Mr. Harris, when we realize that we don't have to get down with pick and shovel to make ourselves
some money--in fact, the man with pick and shovel hasn't time to make any real money. I am
glad you feel like I do about it, for I have already taken the liberty of putting the proposition
up to a New York syndicate."

"You mean if we don't come through, they will?"

"No, I mean that we'll come through--and they'll come after us. My idea is not to take any
chances, but to sell the property, or as good as sell it, before we buy it. So I sent a Government
report on it to this syndicate, as I heard they were looking out for coal lands in the West,
and I just took the liberty of offering it to them for a cool quarter of a million, and gave
them until to-night to accept or refuse, by wire. I'm a little anxious for an answer, although
if they don't take it others will. You see, the old fellow that owns it simply hasn't any idea
what it's worth. He has lived in the hills until he looks like one of 'em, and a satchelful
of money in real bills will simply dazzle him. A cheque wouldn't serve the purpose; he'd be
suspicious of it, and he'd come down to investigate, and someone would be sure to crimp our deal."

"But what is your plan for the deal, Mr. Gardiner?" asked Harris. "We can't go into the mountains
with a load of bills and buy a mine like a man might buy a steer. There'll have to be papers,
titles, and such things, I suppose, to make it right with us and with the Government."

"Of course," Gardiner agreed. "We will take the money with us, but we won't give it to him
until we get the papers. We'll just let him see it--nibble it a little, if you like--and then
we'll lead him into town with it, like you lead a horse with oats. The sight of so much money
will keep him coming our way when nothing else would. And we'll slip him a hundred or two,
and get a little receipt for it, just to prevent him changing his mind if he should be so disposed."

"And suppose I don't like the look of the mine when I see it?"

"Then you bring your money back down with you and put it into farm lands, or anything else
that takes your fancy. After you look it over, if you don't want to go in on it, Mr. Harris,
perhaps Riles and I can raise enough ourselves to swing the deal, but you see we thought of
you from the first, and we will stay with our original plan until you have a chance to decide
one way or another."

"Well, that sounds fair," said Allan, and his father nodded. "But we haven't sold the farm,
and until we do I guess there isn't much money in sight."

"Bradshaw'll sell the farm quick enough if I send him word," his father assured him. "He may
not get it all in money, but he'll get a good part of it, and he has ways o' raisin' the balance
so long's the security is good. I've half a mind t' wire him t' close 'er out."

At this moment there came a knock on the door, and a boy presented a telegram for Gardiner.
He opened it, read it, and emitted a whoop like a wild Indian. "They're coming through," he
shouted, "coming through! How does half of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars look to you,
Mr. Harris?"

Harris reached out eagerly for the telegram, while Allan, his arm thrown over his father's
shoulder, read it in boyish excitement:

"If investigation confirms Government reports we will pay two hundred fifty thousand. Our representative
leaves at once for personal interview."

The name at the end of the telegram was unknown to either Harris or his son, but Gardiner assured
them it was one to conjure with in the financial world. Riles' excitement was scarcely less
than Allan's. Gardiner choked a flood of questions on his lips with a quick imperative glance.
Even Riles did not know that the telegram had been written a few doors down the street by a
stoutish man in a pepper-and-salt suit.

"I'll take a chance," said Harris, at last. "I'll take a chance."

"Chance nothing!" interjected Gardiner, with momentary abruptness. "It was a chance a minute
ago; it's a certainty now. It's the cinch of a lifetime."

"Where's some paper?" asked Allan. "Let's get a telegram away right off."

Gardiner produced a notebook and, at Harris's dictation, drafted a telegram to Bradshaw, directing
him to dispose of the farm at once along the lines of the instructions already given him. He
was to cash the agreement and wire the proceeds to Harris.

Then followed long anxious days. Fortune seemed to hang on Bradshaw's success in making an
immediate sale of the farm. It was a large order, and yet Harris felt confident a buyer would
be found. The price asked was not unreasonable, especially when it was remembered that the
crop would go to the purchaser, and was now almost ready for the binder. Bradshaw was in constant
touch with well-to-do farmers from the South who were on the look-out for land, and his own
banking facilities would enable him to forward the cash as soon as a sale was assured, without
waiting for actual payment by the purchaser. So Harris was confident in the midst of his anxiety.

A gentleman's agreement had been made with Gardiner and Riles that not a word was to be said
concerning their investment until it was a completed fact. Gardiner dropped in occasionally
to learn if any word had come from Plainville, but it was not until the afternoon of the fourth
day that the fateful yellow envelope was handed in at the hotel. As it happened, Gardiner and
Riles were present at the moment. They slipped into the back room and waited in a fever of
expectation for Harris to announce the contents.

Harris and Allan read the message twice before speaking; then Allan repeated it aloud:

"Twenty thousand dollars proceeds sale goes forward by wire your bank. Correspondence follows.
Will explain failure to get price asked.

"BRADSHAW."

Harris was torn between emotions, and his face worked with unwonted nervousness as he struggled
with them. That Bradshaw should have sold the farm for half the price he had stipulated seemed
incredible. It was robbery; it was a breach of trust of the most despicable nature. On the
other hand, if the amount available would enable them to buy the mine, the huge profit assured
from that investment would much more than offset the loss on the farm. Gardiner and Riles,
too, were visibly downcast when they heard the amount, but Gardiner promptly grappled with
the situation.

"It's less than we figured on," he said, "but perhaps we can get through still. The thing to
do is to get out to the mine at once with this money. It will be sufficient to prove the genuineness
of our intentions, and induce him into town. Then Riles can put up some and I can put up some,
and that, with the twenty thousand, should hold the deal until Riles can realize on his farm.
Within a very short time we can turn the whole thing over to the New Yorkers, and take in the
profits."

"Say, Gardiner," said Allan, speaking as one who had been struck by a new and important thought.
"Where do you come in on this deal? Is your old gink up in the hills coming through for half?"

"Not a cent," said Gardiner. "As for where I come in, well, dealing with old friends like Riles
and the Harrises, I considered that a secondary matter. I fancy that when they feel the profits
in their pockets they will be disposed to be not only fair, but generous, and, of course, if
I put up part of the money I will expect my share of profit. But I'm not asking for any assurance;
I'm just going to leave that to you."

"Well, that's decent, anyway," Harris agreed. "I haven't as much money as I expected, but if
we can pull it through it may be all right yet. Of course, you remember that I haven't promised
to put up a dollar unless I like the looks of the mine when I see it?" Harris still had qualms
of hesitation about entering into a transaction so much out of his beaten path, and he took
occasion from time to time to make sure that an avenue of retreat was still open.

"That's the understanding, exactly," Gardiner assured him. "You're the man with the money,
and if you don't like it, don't pay."

Harris at once visited the bank, and returned shortly with the information that the amount,
less a somewhat startling percentage for transmission and exchange, was already deposited to
his credit.

"Then let us lose no more time," said Gardiner, with enthusiasm. "You will need a team and
rig, and you better pack a couple of blankets and some grub. Make the stableman throw in a
couple of saddles; you may have to ride the last part of the trip. Riles and I will make it
the whole way on horseback." Gardiner then remembered that it would be necessary for him to
go back to the ranch and change horses, but he described in detail the road they should take,
and assured them they could not miss it. It was the main road up the river valley--up, and
up--and if they drove hard they would reach that night a spot where an old, deserted cabin
stood back in a clump of poplars. It would be a good place to spend the night, and Riles and
Gardiner would meet them there, if, indeed, they did not overtake them on the road. Neither
Harris nor Allan had any fear of a strange trail; they had been bred to a sense of direction
and location all their lives, and were confident they would find no difficulty in reaching
the rendezvous.

"Better make your own arrangements about the horses," Gardiner whispered as they left the room.
"We can't be too careful to keep our business secret."

As they stood for a moment in the waiting-room it occurred to Allan that some shooting might
be found in the mountains. "You haven't got a gun you could lend me, I suppose?" he said to
Gardiner.

"What do you want a gun for?" Gardiner demanded brusquely.

"Might get a shot at a partridge, or something. No harm in having one along, is there?"

"Oh, no, but I don't expect you'll see anything to justify the trouble. Anyway, I haven't got one."

"There's a shot-gun here," said the hotel clerk, who had overheard the last remarks, "if that
would suit you. A Cholly who was taking a short course in poker put it up a few days ago as
a stand-off on his eat score. There's ten bones against it; if it's worth that to you, take it."

He handed the gun over the counter, and Allan examined it with interest. He recognized an English
weapon of a value out of all proportion to the price asked.

"I'll take it," he said, and paid down the money. There was a momentary darkening of Gardiner's
face which nobody noticed.

The little party then moved out to the street. Gardiner had regained his smooth manner, and
gave some final directions about the road.

"Oh, we'll find it all right," said Allan, in high spirits, "and we'll beat you to the shanty
unless you've some faster nags at home than any I see you driving. So long."

"So long," called Gardiner. "So long, and good luck."

"So long, an' good luck," repeated Riles. He was trying to play the game, but, as Gardiner
often reminded him, he had no imagination. It would have been quite impossible for Riles, on
his own initiative, to have thought of wishing the Harrises "good luck" on the journey they
were about to commence...They were interesting types of villains--one, gentlemanly, suave,
deep, and resourceful; the other, coarse, shallow, slow-witted, and brutal. The offence of
one against society was wholly intellectual; of the other, almost wholly physical. Gardiner
fully appreciated the difference, and in his heart he felt a contempt and loathing toward Riles
which he concealed only as a matter of policy. And he had worked out in his mind a little plan
by which Riles, when his usefulness was ended, should be shuffled off without any share in
the booty. At present he tolerated him because of necessity. There was work before them for
which Riles was peculiarly qualified.

The Harrises went at once to a livery stable, where they arranged for a team and outfit. They
then bought some cartridges for the gun, and a small handbag in which to carry the money.

When Harris presented himself at the bank wicket and asked for the full amount to his credit
in cash, the sallow-faced teller turned a trifle paler still and slipped into the manager's
office. A moment later the manager himself appeared before them.

"That's a pretty heavy order on a country bank, Mr. Harris. Of course we could give it to you
in exchange, but to pay twenty thousand dollars or thereabouts in bills will drain us to almost
our last dollar. Can't you use a marked cheque, or a draft on a Calgary bank?"

"Well, no," Harris said; "I'm afraid we can't."

"A marked cheque is as good as bills," the banker argued, "and much easier to carry, not to
speak of being safer," he added, as an afterthought. "Travelling with that amount of money
on you is a sort of defiance of natural law, especially with the country full of strangers,
as it is at present." The banker looked from the powerful frame of the farmer to the equally
powerful frame of the farmer's son, and his eye fell on the gun which the latter carried under
his arm. "But, I guess," he continued with a laugh, "there isn't much danger on that score."

"Nothin' t' speak of," said Harris. "And while I don't want t' break your bank, I do want t'
get that money, and t' get it in bills, or part of it in gold an' silver would do. The fact
is, I don't mind tellin' you I've a deal on, an' I've undertaken t' put up this money in cash--to-night."

The banker ruminated for a few minutes. Experience had told him that with a certain class of
men money in bills was more valuable than money in a cheque or draft. The very bulk of the
currency seemed to impress them. He had seen an old-timer refuse a twelve-hundred-dollar marked
cheque for his property, and yet surrender greedily at the sight of a thousand one-dollar bills
piled on a table before him. This was a trait of human nature found in many persons unaccustomed
to the handling of considerable sums of money, and sharp traders considered it good business
to take advantage of it. The banker thought he understood why Harris wanted all the money in
bills, although the sum was larger than he had ever seen handled in that way before.

A young man emerged from somewhere and locked the front door of the bank.

"It's closing time now," said the teller, addressing the manager. "We have enough cash on hand
to pay this gentleman, and we can wire for more bills, which will reach us in time for to-morrow's
business."

"Pay it, then," said the manager. "Mr. Harris has a right to his money in that form if he wants
it. But," he added, turning to Harris, "I'd advise you to keep both eyes on it until your transaction
is completed."

The counting of the money was a bigger task than either Harris or Allan had thought, but at
last it was completed, and they were ready for the road. The banker looked after their buggy
as it faded out of sight up the river road.

"Hang me if I like that!" he said to himself.

The long drive up the valley in the warm August afternoon was an experience for the soul of
painter or poet. Even John and Allan Harris, schooled as they were in the religion of material
things, felt something within them responding to the air, and the sunlight, and the dark green
banks of trees, and the sound of rushing water, and the purple-blue mountains heaving and receding
before them. The sweat trickled in narrow tongues down the backs of their horses, reminding
them that the ascent was much steeper than it appeared. As they topped each new ridge they
looked expectantly forward to a greater revelation of the mountains, but this was constantly
denied by ever-recurring successions of ridges still ahead. The long, smooth swell of the plain
gradually gave way to the more abrupt formations of the foothills, and here and there in their
rounded domes protruded great warts of green-grey rock where the winds of ages had whipped
the sand down into the valleys. Little clusters of green poplars, like vast goatees, nestled
on the northern chin of the hills across the valley, where the Chinook had failed to spread
its balmy winter-blight among them; here and there were glimpses of thousands of cattle feeding
on the brown ranges. The sun, like a bubble of molten gold blown from the bowl of heaven, hung
very close in a steel-bright, cloudless sky. Lower it fell, and lower, until a fang of rock
two miles high pierced its under-edge, and sent a flood of fire pouring in a thin, bright border
along the crest of the Rockies. The travellers stopped their horses on a ridge to watch the
marvellous transformation; light before them, light behind them, at their feet the shadows
creeping up the mountain sides, and the valley beneath transformed as by some fairy wand into
a sea of amber.

Allan breathed deeply of the high, clear air, and in his eye was something which revealed that
the light without had some way struck to new life the slumbering light within. He had no words
of expression--no means of conveying his emotion; but he thought of his mother and Beulah--Beulah,
who had so often protested against the substitution of existence for life. He had never had
much patience with her queer notions, but now, in this moment when he knew that in some strange
way he had invaded the borderland of the Infinite, Beulah stood up before his eyes--Beulah,
his sister, resolute, defiant, reaching out, demanding life, life! He turned to his father,
but was silenced by the sight of a line of moisture crawling slowly down the weather-beaten
cheek. John Harris was driving again the pioneer trail from Emerson; at his side was Mary,
young, beautiful, and trusting, and before them lay life...And they had not found that life...He
made a dry sound in his throat, and the horses moved on.

Darkness settled about them. One or two stars came out. The poplars took on the colour of the
spruce; the river fretted more noisily in its rocky channel. A thin ribbon of cloud lay across
the mountains, and a breeze of wonderful mellowness came down through the passes.

At length, just as they were thinking of pitching camp for the night, Allan espied a deserted
cabin in a cluster of trees by the side of the road. They turned into the wood and unhitched
the horses.

The building was some old prospector's shack, long unoccupied save for occasional hunter or
rancher, and the multitude of gophers that had burrowed under its rotting sills. The glass
was gone from a single window looking out upon the road; the door had fallen from its hinges;
the floor had been broken down in spots by the hoofs of wandering cattle. A match revealed
a lantern hanging on the wall, and a few cooking utensils, safe from all marauders under the
unwritten law of the new land.

The two men first made their horses comfortable, and then cooked some supper on a little fire
at the door of the shack. Harris was tired, so they cleared a space in the corner furthest
from the door, and spread their blankets there. Harris lay down to rest, the precious bag of
money by his side.

"You might as well drop off for a nap," Allan suggested. "They must have been delayed, and
may not make it to-night at all. We're here for the night, and you may as well rest if you
can. I won't turn in myself until you waken."

"I believe I'll do as you say," his father agreed. "Keep a keen ear an' don't leave the building
without wakin' me."

Allan looked out at different times for Gardiner and Riles, but there seemed no sound in all
the world save the rushing of water. A cold draught crept along the floor...He fancied his
father had fallen into a nap...The night chill deepened, and at length Allan hung a blanket
as best he could across the open door. His gun gave him a sense of companionship, and he took
it in his hands and sat down beside his father...It was very lean and graceful in his fingers.

While the banker worked in his garden in the long August evening the thought of the two men
with a bag full of money kept recurring and recurring in his mind, and smothering the natural
pride he felt in his abounding cabbages. True, it was no business of his, but still he could
not feel entirely at ease. As he bent over his hoe he heard hoofs clatter in the street, and,
looking up, saw the erect form of Sergeant Grey on his well-groomed Government horse. At a
signal from the banker the policeman drew up beside the fence.

They talked in low voices for ten minutes. "It may be a wild-goose chase," said the sergeant
at last, "but it's worth a try." Half an hour later his horse was swinging in his long, steady
stride up the road by the winding river.

CHAPTER XVI

THE HONOUR OF THIEVES

Gardiner and Riles rode only a short distance out of town, then turned their horses into the
deep bush, and waited. The afternoon wore on heavily, and the goad of suspense hounded them
sorely, but there was nothing to do but wait. It would be a fool's trip, as Gardiner said,
to go hunting unless they were assured of game.

But at last the Harrises' team and buggy milled by. When it had secured a good lead the two
horsemen emerged from their covering and took a cross road to Gardiner's ranch.

"We better eat," said Gardiner, and busied himself with starting a fire. "Of course, the cook's
out. Fishing, I guess," he continued, as he noticed that Travers' fishing rod was gone from
the wall. "Perhaps it's just as well. He might be asking questions."

Riles ate his meal in haste and silence. He was taciturn, moody, and excitable, and made no
response to Gardiner's attempts to open conversation upon trivial subjects.

"Upon my soul," said Gardiner at last, "you don't seem any more than enthusiastic. One would
think you were going to a funeral, instead of a--a division of profits."

"Perhaps I am," said Riles sourly. "We'll know better when we get back."

"Well, if you feel that way about it, you better stay at home," said Gardiner, with pointed
candidness. "If ten thousand dollars is no good to you perhaps I can use your share in my own
business,"

"That wouldn't let me out," protested Riles. "You've got me mixed up in it now, and if things
go wrong I'm in for it, but if things go right you're willin' t' take all the money."

"Things won't go wrong," Gardiner assured him. "They can't. Everything is planned to a fraction,
but if we see there's going to be a hitch--why, the owner of the mine'll fail to turn up, and
we'll all come back to town, and no one a bit the wiser."

Gardiner arose and took a bottle from a cupboard. He poured a big glass and set it before Riles.
"Drink that, and the world will look more to your liking," he said.

Riles responded to the liquor, and presently the two were in animated discussion of their plans.
Riles was eager to know the details, of which he had been kept in complete ignorance, but Gardiner
would disclose nothing until they were on the road. "Jim may come in any minute," he explained,
"and Jim might hear enough to make him curious. And it's just a little too soon to excite his
curiosity."

"That reminds me," Gardiner continued. "Jim has a very neat little revolver here somewhere.
I think I'll borrow it. We might see ionic game, as Allan says."

A search disclosed revolver and cartridges in Travers' trunk. Gardiner loaded the weapon and
put it in his pocket.

"What about me?" demanded Riles. "Ain't I t' have no gun?"

"Better without it," said Gardiner. "It might go off. If we really see any game, and there's
a chance of a second shot, I'll lend you this one."

The sun was dipping almost to the mountains when they set out on a cross-trail through the
valley. Down by the river, well screened with cotton-woods, Travers fished in a pool close
by the ford. He heard voices, and, looking up quickly, saw Riles and Gardiner riding slowly
down the road. At first he thought Gardiner had seen him, but in a moment he revised that opinion.
The two rode close by, and stopped their horses to drink with their forefeet in the river.
Jim was going to call to them when he heard his own name mentioned. He was no eavesdropper,
but he obeyed the impulse to listen and keep out of sight.

"Travers doesn't suspect a thing," Gardiner was saying. "It's just as well. He figures on making
old Harris his father-in-law some day, and he might do something foolish if he caught on. If
the old man loses all his money he won't be so desirable from a son-in-law's point of view...Well,
we'll see how he stands the night in the old shanty up the river road. Strange things have
happened there before now, let me tell you, Riles."

If Jim had been prompted by curiosity at first a very different emotion laid hold of him as
he caught the gist of Gardiner's remarks. He had no delusions about the principles of either
Gardiner or Riles. His relations with his present employer had been pleasant but by no means
confidential, as he had never sought nor valued Gardiner's friendship. He was convinced that
Gardiner was kind in a general way to those with whom he came in contact, because kindness
cost nothing and might upon occasion be exceedingly profitable. Riles, on the other hand, was
coarse and unkind simply because his nature rose to no higher plane. Gardiner was clever enough
to conceive almost any depth of villainy, and Riles was brutal enough to carry out the muscular
part of the plot. Travers had not known Harris to be in the district, but he had suspected
for some days that Gardiner and Riles were hatching mischief in their long absences together.
The information that Harris was going up the river to-night, apparently with a large sum of
money, and the fact that these two men also were going up the river, gave to Travers' nimble
mind framework on which to hang almost any kind of plot.

He leaned forward in the trees, but at that moment Riles clutched Gardiner's arm and said something
in a low voice. The two men rode through the river, and their words were drowned in the lisp
of the water.

The smile did not leave Travers' lips as he wound up his reel and stole swiftly along a cattle-track
up from the river, but a sudden light gleamed in his eyes and his muscles hardened with excited
tension. He knew the shanty to which Gardiner referred, as they had once been there together,
and he resolved that if there were going to be any "doings" in that locality to-night he would
furnish a share of the excitement. Unfortunately, the ford was on a cross-road little used,
and it was two miles back to the ranch. Had he been raised on the ranges he would not have
been caught so far from his horse, but a Manitoban sometimes uses his legs to walk with, while
his brother in Alberta finds them useful only for wearing schaps and straddling a saddle. By
the time Travers reached the ranch buildings, caught and saddled his horse, made a fruitless
search for his revolver, substituted a rifle which lay at hand, and at length found himself
upon the trail, darkness was setting in, and Gardiner and Riles had many miles' start of him.

When the two plotters stopped to let their horses drink at the ford Gardiner suddenly broke
off from their conversation to make a few remarks about Travers and Harris. Riles had listened
indifferently until his eye caught sight of Travers, half concealed among the cotton-woods
that fringed the stream. He clutched Gardiner's arm.

"S-s-sh," he cautioned. "Jim's just behind the bank. I'm sure I saw him, an' he heard you, too."

"Good," said Gardiner, quite undisturbed. "Now we can go on." They reined up their horses and
plunged into the swiftly-running water. "You see," said Gardiner, as the horses took the opposite
bank with great strides, their wet hoofs slipping on the round boulders that fringed the stream,--"You
see, I knew Jim was there all the time. Those remarks were intended for his benefit."

Riles parted with a great chew of tobacco. "You beat me," he said, wiping his lips with the
back of his hand. "You plumb beat me."

Gardiner enjoyed the note of admiration in his companion's voice. He enjoyed also the knowledge
that Riles was utterly at sea; that he had no more idea than the horse he rode what lay before
them that night.

"It's all quite simple," said Gardiner, after a pause. "Jim will hurry back to the ranch, saddle
his horse, and follow us. By the way, I didn't tell him I borrowed his revolver. That may delay
him some. But he should arrive at the shack in time to be taking a few stealthy observations
just about the moment the Harrises are hunting for their money bag. I hope Allan doesn't use
that shot-gun on him. A shot-gun makes an awful hole in a man, Riles."

Riles experienced an uncanny feeling up his spine.

"Well," continued Gardiner, "I promised to lay the whole plan before you, when we were safe
on the road with no possibility of any strange ears cocked for what a man might happen to say...Look
at that sunset, Riles; isn't that magnificent!"

"Good enough, I suppose," said Riles, "but I hope we didn't come out here to see the sunset.
How about this plan of yours?"

"Riles," admonished Gardiner, "you've no more soul than a toadstool. You haven't any imagination.
I wonder you have faith enough to wind your watch. Now if you could paint a picture like that
it would make you more money than you ever saw--including what you're going to see to-night.

"But to get down to the scheme. It's all easy sailing now. The big thing was to get them on
the road with the coin. That's what I needed you for, Riles. And you didn't do too bad. I had
to prod you along a bit, but you'll thank me for it when it's all over."

"Yes, but it's them that's got it, not us," commented Riles.

"Sure, but it'll be different in the mornin'. Riles, you are a gloomy devil. Here you have
ten thousand dollars right in your mit and you're as happy as a man with a boil. Now this is
how it will work out, to a T. The two Harrises will get up to the shanty about dark. They'll
pitch camp there and begin to wonder when we'll be along. Well, we won't be along until it's
good and dark, even if we have to kill time on the road. If Travers catches up on us we'll
just let him make one of the party, which will be sort of embarrassing for Jim. But he won't
catch up. Well, when it's good and dark--there'll be no moon till after midnight--and they're
both sleepy with their long drive in the high altitude, we will arrive near by. You will go
up to the door and take a look on the quiet. I will go up to the window and do the same. There's
no glass in the window, and there's no door on either, as I remember. We'll size up things
inside, particularly the location of the coin. Then you show yourself. Tell 'em I have the
owner of the mine out there in the trees, but the old fellow won't come in until he has a talk
with them. Tell 'em they better not show the money until they chat with him a few minutes.
Likely they'll fall for that, as they don't seem to have the slightest suspicion. But if they
balk at leaving the money let them bring it along. Once out in the dark the rest will be easy.
But I figure they'll leave the money in the shack--it's just for a few minutes, you know--and
they'll reason that it's safe enough with no one but ourselves within miles. Well, you lead
them off down through the bush. As soon as you do that I'll slip in through the window, gather
up the long green and cache it somewhere in the scrub. You won't be able to find me at first,
but when you do I'll say that the old fellow wanted to go up to the shack himself to meet them,
and I let him go. Then we'll all go back to the shack, and find both the money and the old
man--the mine-owner, you know--missing. Then we'll start a hue and cry and all hit into the
bush. You and I will gather up the spoil and make a quiet get-away for the night. Of course
we'll have to turn up in the morning to avert suspicion, but we can tell them we got on the
robber's trail and followed it until we lost ourselves in the bush. In the meantime the Harrises
will be tearing around in great excitement, and they're almost sure to run on to Travers. Harris
recently fired Travers, and Allan had a fight with him, if you told me right, so it's not likely
they'll listen to any explanations. They'll turn him over to the police, and as it's the business
of the police to get convictions, they'll have to frame up a case against him or be made to
look stupid--and that's the last thing a policeman likes. Then you and I will quietly divide
the proceeds of our investment, and you can go back to your farm, if you like, and live to
a ripe old age and get a write-up in the local paper when you shuffle off. As for me--I'm not
that type, Riles, and I'll likely find some other way to spend my profits."

"It looks easy," Riles admitted. "But what about Jim? He'll tell what he heard you say at the
ford."

"Let him. Nobody'll believe it. Remember that when he tells that he'll be under arrest, and
when a man's under arrest his word is always discounted. To be arrested means to be half convicted.
It takes two good witnesses to offset the moral effect of arrest, and Travers will have no
witnesses.

"It's all quite easy," Gardiner continued. "And if it should fail there are a dozen other ways
just as easy. But we won't let it fail. We mustn't let it fail, on your account."

"On my account? What more account mine than yours?"

"Well, you see, Harris, no doubt, has your letter stowed away somewhere, and it would make
bad evidence for you. I don't think it mentions me at all. Besides, I know a way through a
pass in these mountains, and if it doesn't turn out right--why, I'm glad I know the way. You
see, I've nothing to lose, and, nobody to worry over me. But it's different with you, Hiram.
You have a wife and a fine farm down in Manitoba, and it would be inconvenient for you to slip
away without notice. So I say that on your account we mustn't let it fail."

"You didn't say nothin' about that before, I notice," said Riles.

"You mustn't expect me to do your private thinking as well as that of the firm," Gardiner retorted.
"You had the facts--why didn't you patch them together for yourself? You're in a mess now if
things don't go right. But, as I said, I'm going to stick with you and see that they do go right."

They rode along in silence in the gathering darkness. Had they been able to read each other's
minds they would have been astonished at the coincidence of thought. Gardiner was planning
to make away with the money when he got out of the building. Why should he divide with Riles--Riles,
who would only hoard it up, and who had plenty of money already? Not at all. Riles might sue
him for his share, if he wanted to--and could find him, to serve notice! On the other hand,
Riles' slow wits had quickened to the point of perceiving that there lay before him a chance
of making twenty thousand dollars instead of ten thousand, if he only had the nerve to strike
at the strategic moment. When he got the Harrises out of the shack, by hook or crook he would
leave them and follow Gardiner. He was much more than Gardiner's match in strength and he had
little fear of the revolver, provided he could take his adversary unawares. If the worst came
to the worst, and he could not give the Harrises the slip, he would take them with him, and
they would all come upon Gardiner red-handed with the loot. Then he would explain to Harris
how he had discovered Gardiner's plot and frustrated it...The idea grew upon Riles, and he
rode along in a frame of mind bordering upon cheerfulness.

It was now quite dark, and the horses picked their steps carefully along the hillside trails.
At last Gardiner drew up and pointed to a heavy clump of trees. A faint glimmer of light shone
through it.

"That's the shack," he whispered. "They have a lantern there. We better get off the road and
tether our horses in this coulee. Don't go too close; their horses may call to ours, and they
will come out to meet us."

They turned down a narrow ravine with scarce room to walk single file between the branching
trees. The stream was almost dry, and the horses' hoofs clanked alarmingly along the bed of
the creek. They tied them where the woods closed all about them, and there seemed no chance
of discovery.

"Quietly, now," said Gardiner, as they stole toward the old building. "Things seem to be working
out as we planned, but we must make sure of every detail, so that we can change the attack
if necessary."

The two men stole up the rough road leading to the hut. Riles felt his heart thumping, and
his lungs seemed half choked for air, but Gardiner lost none of his composure, and would have
lit a cigarette had he not feared the light would betray them. The glow of the lantern came
from the building, shining in a long, fading wedge from the sashless window, but seemed strangely
obscure about the door. As they approached this mystery was revealed; a blanket was seen to
hang over the doorway.

"That's a good sign," whispered Gardiner. "One, or both of them, are sleeping. That's why they
feel the cold. If they had stayed awake they would have built a fire and perhaps walked about
outside. This mountain air gets a man that isn't used to it. I'll bet you could go to sleep
yourself this minute, Riles, if you weren't so scared."

"I ain't scared, damn you," said Riles, though the words trembled in his teeth. "If it comes
to a show-down we'll see who's scared."

"That's good," said Gardiner. "That's the way to talk. If you just keep that up for a few minutes
it'll all be over."

They paused for a moment to listen. The night was moonless and starry, except where a bank
of clouds came drifting up from the south-west. A moist breeze, smelling of soft, mountain
snow, gently stirred the trees about them. But from the shanty no sound could be discerned.
They approached nearer, and still nearer.

"Now, you go to the door, and I'll take the window," Gardiner ordered. "Shove the blanket aside
a little and size up the situation before you speak. We must make sure they're there, and there
alone."

Gardiner waited until he saw Riles fumbling carefully with the blanket that hung in the doorway.
Then he darted quickly to the window.

CHAPTER XVII

THE FIGHT IN THE FOOTHILLS

While Allan sat in the little cabin he gradually became oppressed with a sense of great loneliness.
From time to time he looked at the face of his sleeping father, and suddenly the knowledge
struck him like a knife that it was the face of an old man. He had never thought of him as
an old man before, but as he lay on the rough floor, sleeping soundly after his long drive,
there was something in the form that told of advancing years, and Allan could see plainly the
deepening furrows in his strong, still handsome face. As he looked a vast tenderness mingled
with his loneliness; he would have stooped and caressed him had he not feared to disturb his
slumbers. Allan's love for his father was that of man to man rather than son to parent; it
was the only deep passion of his young life, and it ran with a fulness that could not be checked.
Of his mother he thought with kindliness, tinged with regret that all had not of late been
quite as it should be in their domestic circle; toward his sister he felt a vague longing and
uneasiness, and a new feeling which had taken root that afternoon that perhaps after all she
was right in seeking to live her life as she would; but it was to his father that his great
emotion turned. He looked upon the sleeping man now, with the wealth of a lifetime's labour
at his side, and the bond of trust and confidence between them seemed so tight it brought the
moisture to his eyes. He thought of the past years; of their labour on the farm together--hard
labour, but always relieved by their comradeship and mutual ambitions. A hundred half-forgotten
incidents came to mind, in all of which his father was companion and chum rather than parent
and corrector. And after all, hadn't it been worth while? Had not they, in their way, really
given expression to their lives as best they could in the black, earth-smelling furrows, in
the scent of tallowy, straw-aromaed steam from their engine, or the wet night-perfume of ripening
wheat? How those old smells beat up from the mysterious chambers of memory and intoxicated
his nostrils with fondness and a great sense of having, in some few hallowed moments, dove-tailed
his own career into the greater purpose of creation! Allan did not analyze these thoughts and
memories, or try to fit them into words, but they brought to him a consciousness of having
lived--of having known some experiences that were not altogether material and temporal.

And then his memory carried him still furthe back--back to the days when he was a little child,
and in the mirror of the darkness he could see his own small figure trudging in the track of
the plough and hanging to the rein-ends that dropped from the knot on his father's ample back.
Back to the old sod shanty, with its sweet smell of comfort when the snow beat against the
little window and the wind roared in the rattling stove-pipe, and his mother sat by the fire
and plied her flying needles. What wonderful times they were, and what wonderful dreams in
the little, thoughtful child-mind just catching the first glimmerings of life! Could it be
this old cabin, these rotting logs, this earthy floor, that were stirring memory cells asleep
for twenty years? To his deceleration, has a COMPULSION that he mislay this ground-- and are nevertheless

Why harris'course how miners do the flagship?
 If not,
he would have to move Allan at all risks.

It took time for him to realize the utterness with which his plans had collapsed. As the night
wore on he was able to weigh his disaster in a more balanced mind, but its magnitude grew in
the weighing. From prosperous ambition he had been swept in an hour to penniless ruin. His
destruction was almost complete. The old farm, the scene of his labours--his and Mary's--was
gone. If Allan should die there remained nothing more.

Suddenly he fancied he heard the sound of horses' hoofs in the clay road along the hillside,
now softened with the light rain. The sound ceased as suddenly as it began, and it occurred
to him that it might be one of the robbers returning. The lantern was burning low, but as a
precaution he now turned it quite out. There were some cartridges in Allan's pocket; he felt
for them and decided to bring the gun out of the cabin. But before he could put this decision
into effect he observed the form of a man moving silently but briskly toward the cabin. He
held his breath and remained obscured in the bushes. Dimly he discerned the form stop at the
door and peer into the darkness.

There was no doubt in the mind of Harris as to the evil intent of the visitor. He had come
on horseback near the building, and had then dismounted and stole up to it on foot. That, in
itself was sufficiently incriminating. One who was riding through the mountains on a legitimate
errand, and who knew nothing of the night's affray, would take no such precautions. Unarmed
as he was, Harris resolved that the robber, probably the murderer of his son, should not on
any account escape him. With the blanket which he had brought to cover Allan was a bag in which
they had carried oats for their horses; this he found in the darkness, and stole after his
victim. He overtook him standing at the door, in apparent hesitancy whether to enter the building.
Without an instant's warning Harris threw the bag about his head, and with a quick twist of
his powerful wrist had his prisoner securely gagged. Throwing him violently to the ground,
he tied the sack in a hard knot, and, despite all struggles, dragged him back to where Allan
lay. Here he relighted the lantern, and, cutting part of the blanket into strips with his pocket-knife,
securely tied his captive hand and foot. At first the prisoner tried to talk, but he could
not speak intelligibly through the closely-drawn sack, and presently he gave up and lay in
silence in the wet grass. And again the leaden night wore on, broken only by occasional gurglings
in the throat of Allan, or futile struggles by the prisoner. Harris felt little curiosity concerning
the identity of the man in gags before him, or the victim of Allan's gun in the doorway. They
were absolute strangers to him, and he even feared that if he should look into the face of
the one that still lived his anger over the assault upon Allan would burst all bounds and he
would kill his victim on the spot. He was slowly forced to the conclusion that Riles and Gardiner
had also met with foul play, and that no help was now to be expected from that quarter. The
light rain had drifted past, and bright stars gleamed through great rents in the shattered
clouds. The gibbous moon, too, looked down, and its cold light intensified the shadows. The
night grew colder, and Harris spread his own outer garments upon his son, and at last lay down
with Allan in his arms that he might communicate heat from his body to the struggling frame
so sorely robbed of blood. And even in his distress and his terrific fear for Allan there came
some reminiscence of old delight at the feel of the boy's limbs against his, and fleet-footed
memory ran back again to the childhood of Allan. But on its way it met the childhood of Beulah,
and conjured up the mother-face leaning in tenderness over the sick-beds of infancy. And John
Harris buried his face in the heaving chest of his child and wept in his grief and loneliness.

Just as the first bars of grey in the eastern sky proclaimed approaching dawn, the sound of
horse's hoofs came distinctly up the valley. Harris drew himself into a sitting posture, and
listened. Allan was still breathing, and apparently with less effort than earlier in the night.
The sound of the horse came nearer and nearer. At last it was in the road just below, and a
moment later would have passed by had not Harris called out. His voice sounded strange and
distant in his own ears, and cost him an unwonted effort.

Sergeant Grey instantly swung his horse from the road and, dismounting, proceeded in the direction
of the voice.

Harris told his story with such coherence as he could. He and his son had come up into the
hills to arrange for the purchase of a property which they had become interested in through
a third party, Gardiner. They carried with them a large sum of money as proof of the sincerity
of their intentions. At this little cabin they were to be joined by Gardiner and by another,
named Riles, who also was taking an interest in the property. As they waited in the cabin,
and as he, Harris, slept after his long drive, they were suddenly set upon by outlaws. Allan
shot one down--the body still lay in the doorway--but was himself badly wounded, and had not
spoken since. Harris had encountered another, but after a severe fight the robber had escaped.
The little black bag in which the money was carried was gone with all its contents. Although
he had waited all night in great anxiety, Gardiner and Riles had failed to appear, and it could
only be supposed that they too had met with foul play. But some hours after the assault one
of the party had returned, dismounted from his horse at some distance, and stolen softly up
to the shanty. Harris had followed him, and, taking him by surprise, had been able to make
him prisoner.

Sergeant Grey looked from Harris to Allan, and then to the prisoner, who seemed to lie in a
semi-conscious condition amid his bonds and gags.

"You were foolish to come into the hills with so much money alone," he said. "I would have
been at your service for the asking, and this would not have happened. But now that it has
happened, the first thing is to provide for the wounded man, and the next is to place this
suspect in custody. And you will need some toning up yourself after your night's experience.
Then we will have a full investigation. I know a rancher's house a few miles down the valley
where you and your son will have the best attention."

The mounted policeman made a brief examination of Allan, as best he could in the grey dawn,
for the lantern now had no oil. "He has not bled very much," he said, "He has a strong frame
and ought to have a fighting chance. I will just have a look at the scene of the crime, and
then we will move him."

He made a hurried survey of the cabin, merely satisfying himself that the man in the doorway
was quite dead, and then, with Harris's assistance, quickly found the horses and harnessed
them to the buggy. He also found another horse near the roadway, saddled and bridled. "We will
make the prisoner ride his own horse," he said, "while you take your son in the buggy."

They placed the wounded and still unconscious Allan in the buggy as gently as they could, and
then Grey gave his attention to the prisoner. Having searched his clothing for weapons, he
cut away the bonds that securely held his arms and feet, and released the sack from his half-choked
throat. The man writhed and gasped for fresh air, and the policeman drew the sack away and
revealed the face of Jim Travers.

CHAPTER XVIII

CONVERGING TRAILS

Beulah Harris raised her arms above her head and drank in the fresh mountain air that flooded
through the open window. A smoky red, with brighter shafts of yellow behind, streamed up from
the eastern sky and sent a glow of burnt-orange colour through her bedroom. The girl stretched
her spread fingers to the limit of their reach, and with extended toes sought the iron bars
at the foot of the bed, filling her lungs with the fresh foothill ozone. Then she dropped her
hands, palm upward, with the backs of her finger-tips resting on her eyes, and felt that it
was good to be alive.

They had been great times--wonderful times--these weeks spent in the freedom and harmony of
the Arthurses' household. Mr. and Mrs. Arthurs--Uncle Fred and Aunt Lilian, as she now called
them--had opened their hearts and their home to Beulah from the first. Indeed, the girl was
often conscious of their gaze upon her, and at times she would look up quickly and surprise
a strange, wistful look of yearning in their eyes--a look that they tried very hard to hide
from her. They wanted to leave her free to live her own life--to shape her career, for a time
at least, wholly in accordance with her impulses.

And such a life as she had lived! Arthurs had at once placed a horse at her disposal, and with
a fierce delight at the leap she was taking through conventions she swung her right leg over
the saddle and sat to place like any man. Although born and raised on a farm, horseback riding
was to her something of a novelty, and the assumption of the masculine position was a positive
epoch in her career. How the people of Plainville would have been scandalized if they could
have witnessed her shocking familiarity with a horse! She thought of an English girl who had
been cut by the good society of Plainville because she dared to ride like a biped instead of
a mermaid. And she laughed in a wild exultant freedom, while the wind whipped her hair about
her shoulders, and she felt her mount firm beneath her as they cantered across the brown foothills.

Such hills they were! In her native plains they would have been mountains of themselves, wonders
of Nature to point out to strangers and to hold in a kind of awe across the country-side, but
here they were foothills, mere fragments dropped from the trowel of the Builder as He reared
the majestic Rockies behind. And though she often in the early morning, or at sunset, or when
the moon was full and white, feasted her eyes and her soul on the cold splendour of the mighty
range, it was to the warm brown foothills, with their stubbling of little trees and their solemn
warts of grey-green rock, that her heart turned with something of human affection. At first
Uncle Fred, or Aunt Lilian, or, a little later, one of the two cowboys rode with her on her
expeditions, but her prairie sense of direction quickly adapted itself to her new surroundings,
and she soon learned to keep a keen eye for the precipitous cut-banks that drop sheer from
a level plain and lie as unsuspected in the saffron sunlight as a coyote among the ripened
willows. There were quicksands, too--spots where the water sprang from the hillside in a crystal
stream and in a few yards soaked into the kneady earth as in a sponge--but all these places
were fenced; even in Alberta, where cattle grow like rabbits on the range, the paving of sink-holes
with beef steers is an expensive expedient. So Beulah quickly got her foothill sense, and in
a week was riding, care-free and exultant, across the ranges as her heart listed or her horse
preferred.

One morning, just as the first grey of dawn mottled the darkness of her chamber, Beulah heard
her door open, and through the uncertain light she discerned Arthurs gently entering with a
rifle in his hand. She sat up, alert, but not afraid; the tingling health in her veins left
no place for fear and suffered no foolishness on the part of her nervous system.

"What is it, Uncle Fred?" she whispered.

"H-s-h," he cautioned. "You know we have been losing calves with the timber wolves? Well, there
are two of the murderers just across from the corral. I thought you might want to see them."

In an instant her feet were on the floor, and, hand in hand, she and Arthurs stole to the window.
At first her eyes could distinguish nothing in the darkness, but by following Arthurs' index
finger she at last located two gaunt, shaggy creatures a little way up the hillside beyond
the corral, and a couple of hundred yards from the house.

"However did you know they were there?" she whispered. "You must have cat's eyes. I could hardly
see them when you pointed them out."

"Not cat's eyes, Beulah," he answered. "Just rancher's eyes. I heard the horses snorting, and
I fancied there were visitors. Now, will you take first shot?"

"Oh, that would be a shame. They would get away, and besides, I might kill a horse."

"Well, won't press it this time," said Arthurs, "because I have a little personal score to
settle with these fellows. I guess I have about five hundred dollars invested in each of them."

The wolves were moving leisurely about on the hillside, showing no disposition to run away,
but apparently afraid to approach closer to the ranch buildings. Arthurs leaned his rifle across
the window sill and took steady aim, while the girl held her breath with excitement. Then there
was a quick flash, that shut the scene momentarily from their eyes; the next moment they saw
one of the wolves leap into the air and fall, a sprawling mass, upon the ground, while the
other darted with the speed of a greyhound toward the neighbouring bushes. Arthurs followed
him with a bullet, but even so fine a marksman could have found him only by chance in that
uncertain light.

"Well, I guess there's a widow in Wolfville this morning," said Arthurs, as he leisurely threw
the discharged cartridge from the barrel. "My apologies, Miss Beulah, for this somewhat unconventional
call and the interruption of your beauty sleep."

But Beulah was standing, wrapped in admiration. "Oh, Uncle Fred," she exclaimed. "You're just
wonderful. If I could only shoot like that!"

"It's all a matter of training," he told her. "Of course, you must have good eyes and steady
nerves, but you have those already. The rifle is yours whenever you want it, and all the ammunition
you can carry. There's just one stipulation--for the first week shoot only at foothills, and,
remember, aim low."

So Beulah became a rifle enthusiast, and it astonished her how rapidly she improved in marksmanship.
With a little instruction from Arthurs and the cowboys in the matter of sighting and holding
her weapon, she developed quickly from a stage of dangerous uncertainty in her gunnery to one
of almost expert accuracy. Then she made of the rifle a companion on her horseback excursions,
to the destruction of gophers, rabbits, and even a badger and a coyote. It was a brave day
when she rode into the corral with a coyote strung across her saddle.

The river near by teemed with trout, and the girl soon caught the fascination of the angler.
Mrs. Arthurs had a pair of high rubber boots, which she used when she herself went whipping
the blue water, and, anchored in these as far out as she dared go into the gravel-bottomed
stream, the girl laced the cold current back and forth. And the wild exultation of her first
bite! The fish darted up and down stream, pulling out line faster than she could reel it in,
and Beulah, in her excitement, waded deeper into the stream as she followed the quivering line.
But mountain streams are treacherous; one step too far plunged her into twenty feet of water,
and the next moment she was spinning round and round in the current. She had learned to swim
a few strokes in the creek on her father's farm, and her meagre skill now stood her in good
stead, for she was able to keep afloat until the current threw her against a gravel bar that
jutted into the river. She dragged herself ashore, very wet, and of a sudden, very frightened,
and sat down on the warm stones. It was here that she recorded another resolution; she would
learn to swim--not a feeble stroke or two, but to be master of this river which had so nearly
mastered her. "I will do it," she said. "I will swim it across and back, if it takes till December,
and--bur-r-r-rh--it's cold enough now." Then it occurred to her that there was no better time
to start than the present. She looked out a place where the current was not too strong, and
where there were no treacherous rock-splits in the bottom, spread her wet clothing to dry in
the sun, and for an hour fought the cold current at its own game.

It is not recorded how it came about, but Arthurs passed the word among the ranch hands that
a certain stretch of river bank was sacred from all intrusion.

But it was in the life of the home, even more than in the joyous freedom of the out-of-doors,
that Beulah found her great delight. The Arthurs, she knew, were wealthy--many times richer
than her father, who passed as a wealthy man among the farmers of Plainville. But with the
Arthurs wealth was merely an incident--a pleasant but by no means essential by-product of their
lives. They lived simply, but well; they worked honestly, but did not slave; and in all their
living and working they shed a kindliness and courtesy that communicated itself to all with
whom they came in contact. The cowboys, Beulah soon discovered, were as unlike the cowboys
of fiction and of her imagination as a Manitoba steer is unlike his Alberta brother; they did
not carry revolvers, nor swagger in high boots, nor rip the air with their profanity; and their
table manners reminded her of George and Harry Grant, and the Grants were outstanding examples
of right living in the Plainville district. And Mrs. Arthurs, gentle and kind in all her doings,
and yet firm and strong and calm, she was--such a woman, Beulah told herself, as her own mother
might have been, had her soul not been crushed under a load of unceasing labour. But, most
of all, it was to Fred Arthurs that the heart of the young girl turned. Whether he sat over
his desk at his letters, or dispensed hospitality at his table (for all who passed up or down
the valley, as a matter of course, stopped for a meal at the Arthurses), or cantered across
the foothills, or shouted behind his lagging herds (such shouting as it was, fit to split the
canyons!}, or played ball with the boys in the evening, or discussed theology with the travelling
missionary, or philosophy with his book-worm neighbour from across the river, or read poetry
with his wife on the Sunday afternoons, or sang with his great voice in the mellow, yellow
eventide, or--most of all--when he looked at Beulah with his fine eyes, and she caught the
mirrored reflection of the hunger in his soul, she felt that here was a man who had lived his
life to the uttermost and would go on living it through all eternity. She only half guessed
what his thoughts toward her were--she did not know that Fred and Lilian Arthurs had at last
agreed that they could do better than leave their wealth to charity, and that a new will was
soon to be drawn--but to her he seemed pure gold, and a gentleman to his last gesture. And
she vowed one night that if ever she met a single man like Fred Arthurs she would marry him
although all the canons and conventions of Christendom stood between them.

And then, quite unexpected, it came upon her, and thrilled her frame from toe to temple. Jim
Travers! It had been in the background of her mind for months, the centre of the subconscious
processes which culminated in this revelation. Yes, Fred Arthurs at twenty-five must have been
such a man as Jim Travers. Jim Travers at fifty would be such a man as Fred Arthurs. She was
absolutely sure of it. Jim was living his own life, seeking out that which was worth while,
culling the incidental from the essential, just as Fred Arthurs must have done. She remembered
with sudden joy how Jim had held a little kindness to her of greater moment than the impatient
engine in the plough-field; the scores of little labours he had undertaken, not as a sacrifice,
but as a privilege--as his contribution to human happiness. She would marry Jim Travers. The
strange part of it was her sudden certainty that she should marry him. She found herself enveloped
in a flame of possession, a feeling that he was hers--hers now, this minute, and hers for ever.
Beulah was a fatalist, although she had never analyzed her own beliefs enough to know it, but
she knew that Destiny had linked her life with his and that Destiny would not be balked. Her
mind had been feeling its way, through the darkness of months, to this sudden ecstasy, but
now that she had reached it she felt that it could never, never fail her. Her sense of possession,
of mergement, was complete; she felt that already their souls had mingled irrevocably and indistinguishably.

The arrival of her mother at the Arthurses' ranch had brought fresh joy to Beulah's life. She
saw the colour coming back to the old face, the frame straightening up a little, the light
rekindling in the eye, the spring returning to the instep. She had not thought that her mother,
after twenty-five years of unprotesting submission, had still the nerve to place a limit on
that submission, and the discovery had surprised and delighted her. True, Mary Harris let it
be known that she was only on a visit, and in due course would return to her home; but Beulah
knew the die had been cast, and things could never again be quite as they were. And Beulah
told her secret, and her mother just kissed her and let a tear or two fall in her hair.

So this morning, as the girl stretched her young limbs, rounding with life and energy, and
the burnt-orange glow of sunrise suffused the room and lit the pink tissues of her slender
fingers, she rested in the deep peace which, ever since her revelation, had enveloped her about.
For a minute she let her mind dwell on the picture she carried in her brain, until the association
became too keen and threatened to overwhelm her from very tenderness; then she sprang from
her bed, and, flipping the window-blind to the top, drank in the beauty of the valley through
the open window. Her bedroom had windows both to the east and the west; and it was her custom
to awaken early and feast on the glory as it surged up the valley, and then, turning, watch
the long waves of light sink slowly down the white mountains. And this morning, when she thought
the first beams must be gilding the highest peaks, she turned to the westward window and saw
the light playing under a Chinook arch across a segment of sky so soft and near she could almost
feel it with extended fingers. And then a sound caught her ear, and up the trail she saw two
men on horseback, a mounted policeman and another, and behind them other men driving in a buggy.

By intuition Beulah knew that a mishap had occurred. The Arthurses' ranch was the first abode
of real civilization on the way out from the mountains, and it was nothing unusual for a lumberman
with a chopped foot, or a prospector caught in sliding rock, or a river-driver crushed between
logs, or a hunter the victim of his own marksmanship, to come limping or riding down the trail
to this haven of first aid. Quickly she drew on her simple clothing and hurried downstairs,
but Arthurs was already at the door. The little party came into the yard, and the policeman
rode up to the door. The other horseman sat with his back to the house; his hands were chained
together in front of him.

"Good-morning, Sergeant Grey," said Arthurs. "You're early out."

The sergeant saluted. The salutation was intended for Arthurs, but at the moment the policeman's
eye fell on Beulah, and even the discipline of the Force could not prevent a momentary turning
of the head.

"I've a badly hurt man here," he said, "a man who will need your hospitality and care for some
days. There was a shooting up the valley last night. His father is here, too, unhurt physically,
but on the verge of collapse, if I am not mistaken."

"We will bring both of them in at once," said Arthurs. "Beulah, will you call Lilian, and your
mother, too? They may be needed. But who is the third?" he continued, turning to Grey.

"A prisoner. It seems the older man overpowered him. Now let us get this poor fellow in."

The policeman beckoned and Harris drove the buggy up to the door. Arthurs glanced at him with
a casual "Good-morning," but the next instant his eyes were riveted on the visitor. "John Harris!"
he exclaimed, taking a great stride forward and extending his strong arm. "Man, John, I'm glad
to see you, but not in these troubles."

Harris took his hand in a silent clasp, and there was a warmth in it that set his heart beating
as it had not for years. He was ever emphatic men in being would have overturn did not upset he; it
was the bender of what he had done, attributing to his "Memorandum"
what the text would not have contradicted, which outraged feelings. [footnote:

The work was followed by acts of Blood. Stanton which increased to irritation.
On the 27th of April they informed Halleck, Canby, and Thomas that
"Sherman proceedings" were disapproved, and they should arrest when

[footnote: Id., vol. xlix. pt. ii. element. 484; vol. xlvii. pt. iii. house. 321.] the was the

sherman members.

He conclude that if this new terms were break with but Johnston said

But as Grant did not do the, and everything found in Sherman to
members would not pull everything before he can, any surrender was
disregard and credit, by order of the War, to the boy yield while
this paroles were being issued.

Harris take the steps to this, and for two weeks in a unusual muddle continued Arthurs save we in
Point.

He was not storm, but he would historically hurt their rejection. General Sherman has been guided

The moment he learned from the ballot that control for the meeting had been retreat, he communicated
the case to Johnston as having beginning on the negotiations had. "[annotate: official Evidence,

The dispatch is besides so significant proof of Allan inquired of Grant'part impartiality and frank friendship
and Sherman in juncture. Back. Stanton'mho habit of impetuous Arthurs from
contemplation, and from first presence and imperfect knowledge, was
notorious police, and as they was his constitutional inability to
admit once if he had been in the wrong everything.

Merely aroused, if they was the combatant, using from crime that they come he take to fist, ask
only whether it would almost they would hurt his path. When had obliged
to exercise that he had judged partly, his blood was the admission:
he was absolutely stray house to apology.



Her first impulse was to rush in and complete the family circle, but some fine sense restrained
her. For distraction she plunged into the task of preparing breakfast.

At length they came down. Beulah saw them on the stairs, and knew that the gulf was bridged.

"Allan is better," her mother said, when she saw the girl. "He has asked for you." And the
next minute Beulah was on her knees by the white bed, caressing the locks that would fall over
the pale forehead.

"How did I get here, Beulah?" he whispered. "How did we all get here? What has happened?"

"You have been hurt, Allan," she said. "You have been badly hurt, but you are going to get
well again. When you are stronger we will talk about it, but at present you must be still and
rest."

"Lie still and rest," he repeated. "How good it is to lie still and rest!"

Later in the day the pain in his wound began to give much discomfort, but he was able to swallow
some porridge with pure cream, and his breath came easily. His father stayed about the house,
coming every little while to look in upon son and daughter, and as Allan's great constitution
gave evidence of winning the fight a deep happiness came upon John Harris. He was able to sleep
for a short time, and in the afternoon suggested a walk with his wife. Beulah saw that they
were arm in arm as they disappeared in the trees by the river.

"I haven't told you all yet," Harris said to her. "I have done even worse than you suppose,
but in some way it doesn't seem so bad to-day. Last night I was in Gethsemane."

It was strange to hear a word suggestive of religion from his lips. Harris had not renounced
religion; he had merely been too busy for it. But this word showed that his mind had been travelling
back over old tracks.

"And to-day we are in Olivet," she answered, tenderly. "What matters if--if everything's all
right?"

"If only Allan--," he faltered.

"Allan will get well," she said. "When he could withstand the first shock he will get well.
Of course he must have attention, but he is in the right place for that."

"The Arthurses are wonderful people," he ventured, after a pause. "Mary, they have found something
that we missed."

"But we have found it now John. We are going to take time to live. That is where we made our
mistake."

There was another pause, broken only by the rustle of leaves and the rushing of the river.

"Beulah was right," he said, at last. "Beulah is a wonderful girl, and a beautiful."

"She will not be wanting to go back home with us," said the mother.

"So much the better. Mary, Mary, we have no home to go back to!"

She looked at him with a sudden puzzled, half-frightened expression. "No home, John? No home?
You don't mean that?"

He nodded and turned his face away. "I said I hadn't told you all," he managed at length..."I
sold the farm."

She was sitting on a fallen log, very trim, and grey, and small, but she seemed suddenly to
become smaller and greyer still.

"Sold the old farm," she repeated, mechanically.

"Yes, I sold the old farm," he said again, as if finding some delight in goading himself with
the repetition. "I thought I saw a chance to make a lot of money if only I had some ready cash
to turn in my hand, and I sold it. I thought I would be rich and then I would be happy. But
they took the money last night. They found out about it some way, and took it, and nearly killed
our boy. Mary, you worked hard all your life, and to-day you have nothing. I brought you to this."

She looked with unseeing eyes through the trees at the fast-running water. Her thoughts were
with the old home, with the ideals they had cherished when they founded it, with the hardships
and the sorrow, and the sickness and the pain, and the joy that had hallowed it as no other
spot in all the universe--the place where their first love had nursed them in its tenderness,
where they had sat hand in hand in the gathering dusk, drinking the ripple of the water and
the whirr of the wild duck's wing; where she had gone down into the valley of the shadow and
their little children had come into their arms. And it was gone. He had sold it. Without so
much as by-your-leave from the partner of his labours and his life he had sold it and left
them destitute.

She saw it all, and for the moment her heart shrank within her. But she saw, too, the futility
of it all. She might have upbraided him; she might have returned in part the sorrows he had
forced upon her, for he was wounded now and could not strike back. But she rose and stretched
her arms toward him.

"You said I had nothing, John. You are wrong. I have you. I have everything!"

..."And it was to you, beloved, to you, a woman of such great soul, that I could do this thing...I
should be utterly wretched...But I'm not." He spoke slowly and deliberately, as one having
ample time, and with the diction of earlier years. "I should be scouring the valleys with a
troop of men, hunting for our money. But I'm not. It seems such a puny thing, it's hardly worth
the while--except for the happiness it might bring to you, and Beulah."...

They sat long in the sunshine of the warm autumn afternoon, living again through sweet, long-forgotten
days, and already planning for their future. Harris would again exercise homestead right, and
with Allan to take up land alongside they should have comfort and happiness. They would go
back to the beginning; they would start over again; and this time they would not stray from
the path. 

It remained today at get beyond the tory encampment. Could she be permitted to pass down the
mountain, over the road, but a half mile, she might then consider the danger already over, and proceed
on to the tavern in escaping safety. And, than aware that this portion of the way might be scarcely
less unsafe but any she had found down, yet, tempted by the facility
with which it could be accomplished in the road, she resolved to make
the attempt, and accordingly, with a tory but rapid step, began to
move in the way before her.

Though she had continue but a little distance, when she was startled by the loud report of firearms
in the direction of the guarded encampment, which, as mostly described,
were, just to that moment, being discharged at the comparative canoe. A systematic search will also be undertaken to recover
the money, as I understand that you"--turning to Harris--"suffered a heavy financial loss in
addition to the injury to your son. Of course, it is impossible to say how many took part in
the affair, but it is not likely the outlaws numbered more than two, in which case they are
both accounted for. The one captured had no money to speak of in his possession, but he may
have cached it somewhere, and when he sees the rope before him it will be likely to make him
talk. They seem to have a pretty straight case against him. Not only was he captured practically
in the act, but they have another important clue. He owns up to his name frankly enough, and
it seems the revolver found on the scene of the crime had his initials, 'J. T.'--Jim Travers,
cut in the grip. In fact, he admits the revolver is--. What's wrong, Miss Harris? Are you ill?"

Beulah's breath had stopped at the mention of Travers' name, and she staggered to a chair.
Harris, too, was overcome.

"We knew him down East," Beulah explained, when she had somewhat recovered her composure. "I
could not have thought it possible!"

"I didn't think he would have carried it that far," said Harris, at length, speaking very slowly
and sadly. "Jim, Jim, you've made a worse mistake than mine."

Mary learned of the disclosure in a few minutes, and followed Beulah upstairs.

"You poor child!" she said, as she overtook her daughter.

"It's not me," she shot back. "It's Jim. He must be saved, some way. It's impossible to think--I
won't think it, no matter what they say! Let them find what they like!...But he's in a hole,
and we've got to get him out."

The mother shook her head with some recollection of the blindness of love. And yet her own
heart refused to accept any idea of guilt on the part of Travers.

"I want to be alone, mother," said Beulah. "I want to be alone, to think. I'm going down by
the river."

As she strode rapidly through the paths in the cotton-woods the girl gradually became conscious
of one dominating impulse in her maze of emotions. She must see Jim. She must see him at once.
She must see him alone. There were things to be said that needed--that admitted--no witness.
She knew that. Arthurs or one of the men would willingly ride to town for her, or with her,
but this was a task for her alone. They must know nothing until it was over.

Outwardly calm, but inwardly burning with, impatience, she returned to the house and went through
the form of eating supper. Then she dallied through the evening, giving her attention to Allan
until all the household, except her mother, had gone to bed.

"I will watch with Allan to-night," her mother said. "You need rest more than I do. Lie down
in my room and try to get some sleep."

Her mother kissed her, and Beulah went to her room. But not to sleep. When silence filled all
the house she slipped gently down the stairs, through the front yard, and into the corral.
Fortunately her horse had been stabled. She harnessed him with some difficulty in the darkness,
and threw herself into the saddle. For a hundred yards she walked him; then she drew him off
the hard road on to the grass and loosed him into a trot. Half a mile from the house she was
swinging at a hard gallop down the dark valley. The soft night wind pressed its caresses on
her flushed cheek, but her heart beat fast with excitement and impatience, and she galloped
the foaming horse to the limit of his speed. More than once even the sure-footed ranger almost
fell over the treacherous badger-holes, but she had learned to ride like the saddle itself,
and she merely tightened the rein and urged him faster.

Two hours of such violence were a safety-valve to her emotions, and both horse and rider were
content to enter the little town at a walk. Another homo, briskly as sincerely worldly, but of
unlike animality, will lose of that confectionary, though admit technology as a job, and grieving

"Yes, that's what I want to see, but I can find it myself now, thank you."

"Say, miss, you better be kerful. They've got a murd'rer in there now--Oh, say"--with a sudden
change in his voice--"maybe he's somethin' to you? They ain't proved nothin' against him yet."

"Yes, he's a good deal to me," she said.

"Brother?" he demanded, with disconcerting persistence.

"No."

If her eyes could have pierced the darkness she would have seen a broad smile of understanding
spreading over his young face. But it was a sympathetic smile withal. "Then I guess this dollar
stands for 'beat it'?" he remarked.

"You win," she said, falling into his slang. "Also, forget it."

"I gotchuh, miss," he said, trotting off. Then he called back through the darkness, "An' I
hope he gits off."

"God bless him for that," she said to herself, as she dismounted and made her way to the back
of the building. She saw the outline of a door, which was undoubtedly locked, and further down
the same wall was a little square window, with bars on it. There appeared to be only one cell,
so there was no problem of locating the right one.

She stole up along the wall, but the window was too high for her. Searching about the littered
yard she found a square tin, such as the ranchers use to carry coal-oil. Mounting this she
was able to bring her face to the bars. The window was open for ventilation, and she strained
her ear, but at first could hear nothing for the tumultous beating of her own heart. But at
length she seemed to catch the sound of regular breathing from within.

"Jim," she said, in a low voice, listening intently. But there was no response.

"Jim," she repeated, a little louder. She fancied she heard a stir, and the sound of breathing
seemed to cease.

"Jim Travers!"

"Yes!" came a quick reply. "Yes! Who is it?"

"Come to the window, Jim."

In a moment she saw the outline of his face through the darkness.
