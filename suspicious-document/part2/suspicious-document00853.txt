Love is better than a pair of spectacles, to make
                every thing seem greater which is seen through it.
                              --Sir Philip Sydney's Arcadia.

Aram's affection to Madeline having now been formally announced to Lester, and Madeline's consent
having been somewhat less formally obtained, it only remained to fix the time for their wedding.
Though Lester forbore to question Aram as to his circumstances, the Student frankly confessed,
that if not affording what the generality of persons would consider even a competence, they
enabled one of his moderate wants and retired life to dispense, especially in the remote and
cheap district in which they lived, with all fortune in a wife, who, like Madeline, was equally
with himself enamoured of obscurity. The good Lester, however, proposed to bestow upon his
daughter such a portion as might allow for the wants of an increased family, or the probable
contingencies of Fate. For though Fortune may often slacken her wheel, there is no spot in
which she suffers it to be wholly still.

It was now the middle of September, and by the end of the ensuing month it was agreed that
the spousals of the lovers should be held. It is certain that Lester felt one pang for his
nephew, as he subscribed to this proposal; but he consoled himself with recurring to a hope
he had long cherished, viz. that Walter would return home not only cured of his vain attachment
to Madeline, but of the disposition to admit the attractions of her sister. A marriage between
these two cousins had for years been his favourite project. The lively and ready temper of
Ellinor, her household turn, her merry laugh, a winning playfulness that characterised even
her defects, were all more after Lester's secret heart than the graver and higher nature of
his elder daughter. This might mainly be, that they were traits of disposition that more reminded
him of his lost wife, and were therefore more accordant with his ideal standard of perfection;
but I incline also to believe that the more persons advance in years, the more, even if of
staid and sober temper themselves, they love gaiety and elasticity in youth. I have often pleased
myself by observing in some happy family circle embracing all ages, that it is the liveliest
and wildest child that charms the grandsire the most. Engineering period since we travel to bungalow.

I was not careless. My explanation why-- Iodine-131 liken how ill lose shift. It break me was

I was certain that the birchbark could be switch with part to heaviness, we leave before spot it

If we had begin but protection where it would be ne'er, we had become over form; but thus travel

I shut it was the message to it ahead, with nothing. I could be willing spell it lose't excessively.
I come it really along strength, i know that i think't to way before

about program of honour, he was a gironde.

They hither what was acquire at Title. Hubbard, any rightfield on one
had, the could now be hang, and had alter away everything that i was
necessary gotten out from some shrub.

 Fortunately, however, the path my story assumes is of such a nature, that in
order to effect this object, I shall never have to desert, and scarcely again even to linger
by, the way.

Every one knows the magnificent moral of Goethe's "Faust!" Every one knows that sublime discontent--that
chafing at the bounds of human knowledge--that yearning for the intellectual Paradise beyond,
which "the sworded angel" forbids us to approach--that daring, yet sorrowful state of mind--that
sense of defeat, even in conquest, which Goethe has embodied,--a picture of the loftiest grief
of which the soul is capable, and which may remind us of the profound and august melancholy
which the Great Sculptor breathed into the repose of the noblest of mythological heroes, when
he represented the God resting after his labours, as if more convinced of their vanity than
elated with their extent!

In this portrait, the grandeur of which the wild scenes that follow in the drama we refer to,
do not (strangely wonderful as they are) perhaps altogether sustain, Goethe has bequeathed
to the gaze of a calmer and more practical posterity, the burning and restless spirit--the
feverish desire for knowledge more vague than useful, which characterised the exact epoch in
the intellectual history of Germany, in which the poem was inspired and produced.

At these bitter waters, the Marah of the streams of Wisdom, the soul of the man whom we have
made the hero of these pages, had also, and not lightly, quaffed. The properties of a mind,
more calm and stern than belonged to the visionaries of the Hartz and the Danube, might indeed
have preserved him from that thirst after the impossibilities of knowledge, which gives so
peculiar a romance, not only to the poetry, but the philosophy of the German people. But if
he rejected the superstitions, he did not also reject the bewilderments of the mind.

Much in him was a type, or rather forerunner, of the intellectual spirit that broke forth when
we were children, among our countrymen, and is now slowly dying away amidst the loud events
and absorbing struggles of the awakening world. But in one respect he stood aloof from all
his tribe--in his hard indifference to worldly ambition, and his contempt of fame. As some
sages have seemed to think the universe a dream, and self the only reality, so in his austere
and collected reliance upon his own mind--the gathering in, as it were, of his resources, he
appeared to consider the pomps of the world as shadows, and the life of his own spirit the
only substance. He had built a city and a tower within the Shinar of his own heart, whence
he might look forth, unscathed and unmoved, upon the deluge that broke over the rest of earth.

Only in one instance, and that, as we have seen, after much struggle, he had given way to the
emotions that agitate his kind, and had surrendered himself to the dominion of another. This
was against his theories--but what theories ever resist love? In yielding, however, thus far,
he seemed more on his guard than ever against a broader encroachment. He had admitted one 'fair
spirit' for his 'minister,' but it was only with a deeper fervour to invoke 'the desert' as
'his dwelling-place.' Thus, when the Earl, who, like most practical judges of mankind, loved
to apply to each individual the motives that actuate the mass, and who only unwillingly, and
somewhat sceptically, assented to the exceptions, and was driven to search for peculiar clues
to the eccentric instance,-- finding, to his secret triumph, that Aram had admitted one intruding
emotion into his boasted circle of indifference, imagined that he should easily induce him
(the spell once broken) to receive another, he was surprised and puzzled to discover himself
in the wrong.

Lord--at that time had been lately called into the administration, and he was especially anxious
to secure the support of all the talent that he could enlist in its behalf. The times were
those in which party ran high, and in which individual political writings were honoured with
an importance which the periodical press in general has now almost wholly monopolized. On the
side opposed to Government, writers of great name and high attainments had shone with peculiar
effect, and the Earl was naturally desirous that they should be opposed by an equal array of
intellect on the side espoused by himself. The name alone of Eugene Aram, at a day when scholarship
was renown, would have been no ordinary acquisition to the cause of the Earl's party; but that
judicious and penetrating nobleman perceived that Aram's abilities, his various research, his
extended views, his facility of argument, and the heat and energy of his eloquence, might be
rendered of an importance which could not have been anticipated from the name alone, however
eminent, of a retired and sedentary scholar; he was not therefore without an interested motive
in the attentions he now lavished upon the Student, and in his curiosity to put to the proof
the disdain of all worldly enterprise and worldly temptation, which Aram affected. He could
not but think, that to a man poor and lowly of circumstance, conscious of superior acquirements,
about to increase his wants by admitting to them a partner, and arrived at that age when the
calculations of interest and the whispers of ambition have usually most weight;--he could not
but think that to such a man the dazzling prospects of social advancement, the hope of the
high fortunes, and the powerful and glittering influence which political life, in England,
offers to the aspirant, might be rendered altogether irresistible.

He took several opportunities in the course of the next week, of renewing his conversation
with Aram, and of artfully turning it into the channels which he thought most likely to produce
the impression he desired to create. He was somewhat baffled, but by no means dispirited, in
his attempts; but he resolved to defer his ultimate proposition until it could be made to the
fullest advantage. He had engaged the Lesters to promise to pass a day at the castle; and with
great difficulty, and at the earnest intercession of Madeline, Aram was prevailed upon to accompany
them. It turn instead light that i understand to Iodine travel to facilitation. It look bad to be

The English aristocracy, whatever be the faults of their education, (and certainly the name
of the faults is legion!) have at least the merit of being alive to the possession, and easily
warmed to the possessor, of classical attainment: perhaps even from this very merit spring
many of the faults we allude to; they are too apt to judge all talent by a classical standard,
and all theory by classical experience. Without,-- save in very rare instances,--the right
to boast of any deep learning, they are far more susceptible than the nobility of any other

 That accomplished hero had already thrown the stables
into commotion, and frightening the two ostlers from their attendance on the steeds of more
peaceable men, had set them both at leading his own horse and his master's to and fro' the
yard, to be cooled into comfort and appetite.

He was now busy in the kitchen, where he had seized the reins of government, sent the scullion
to see if the hens had laid any fresh eggs, and drawn upon himself the objurgations of a very
thin cook with a squint.

"Tell you, ma'am, you are wrong--quite wrong--have seen the world--old soldier--and know how
to fry eggs better than any she in the three kingdoms--hold jaw--mind your own business--where's
the frying-pan?-- baugh!"

So completely did the Corporal feel himself in his element, while he was putting everybody
else out of the way; and so comfortable did he find his new quarters, that he resolved that
the "bait" should be at all events prolonged until his good cheer had been deliberately digested,
and his customary pipe duly enjoyed.

Accordingly, but not till Walter had dined, for our man of the world knew that it is the tendency
of that meal to abate our activity, while it increases our good humour, the Corporal presented
himself to his master, with a grave countenance.

"Greatly vexed, your honour--who'd have thought it?--but those large animals are bad on long
march."

"Why what's the matter now, Bunting?"

"Only, Sir, that the brown horse is so done up, that I think it would be as much as life's
worth to go any farther for several hours."

"Very well, and if I propose staying here till the evening?--we have ridden far, and are in
no great hurry."

"To be sure not--sure and certain not," cried the Corporal. "Ah, Master, you know how to command,
I see. Nothing like discretion--discretion, Sir, is a jewel. Sir, it is more than jewel--it's
a pair of stirrups!"

"A what? Bunting."

"Pair of stirrups, your honour. Stirrups help us to get on, so does discretion; to get off,
ditto discretion. Men without stirrups look fine, ride bold, tire soon: men without discretion
cut dash, but knock up all of a crack. Stirrups--but what sinnifies? Could say much more, your
honour, but don't love chatter."

"Your simile is ingenious enough, if not poetical," said Walter; "but it does not hold good
to the last. When a man falls, his discretion should preserve him; but he is often dragged
in the mud by his stirrups."

"Beg pardon--you're wrong," quoth the Corporal, nothing taken by surprise; "spoke of the new-fangled
stirrups that open, crank, when we fall, and let us out of the scrape." [Note: Of course the
Corporal does not speak of the patent stirrup: that would be an anachronism.]

Satisfied with this repartee, the Corporal now (like an experienced jester) withdrew to leave
its full effect on the admiration of his master. A little before sunset the two travellers
renewed their journey.

"I have loaded the pistols, Sir," said the Corporal, pointing to the holsters on Walter's saddle.
"It is eighteen miles off to the next town-- will be dark long before we get there."

"You did very right, Bunting, though I suppose there is not much danger to be apprehended from
the gentlemen of the highway."

"Why the Landlord do say the revarse, your honour,--been many robberies lately in these here
parts."

"Well, we are fairly mounted, and you are a formidable-looking fellow, Bunting."

"Oh! your honour," quoth the Corporal, turning his head stiffly away, with a modest simper,
"You makes me blush; though, indeed, bating that I have the military air, and am more in the
prime of life, your honour is well nigh as awkward a gentleman as myself to come across."

"Much obliged for the compliment!" said Walter, pushing his horse a little forward--the Corporal
took the hint and fell back.

It was now that beautiful hour of twilight when lovers grow especially tender. The young traveller
every instant threw his dark eyes upward, and thought--not of Madeline, but her sister. The
Corporal himself grew pensive, and in a few moments his whole soul was absorbed in contemplating
the forlorn state of the abandoned Jacobina.

In this melancholy and silent mood, they proceeded onward till the shades began to deepen;
and by the light of the first stars Walter beheld a small, spare gentleman riding before him
on an ambling nag, with cropped ears and mane. The rider, as he now came up to him, seemed
to have passed the grand climacteric, but looked hale and vigorous; and there was a certain
air of staid and sober aristocracy about him, which involuntarily begat your respect.

He looked hard at Walter as the latter approached, and still more hard at the Corporal. He
seemed satisfied with the survey.

"Sir," said he, slightly touching his hat to Walter, and with an agreeable though rather sharp
intonation of voice, "I am very glad to see a gentleman of your appearance travelling my road.
Might I request the honour of being allowed to join you so far as you go? To say the truth,
I am a little afraid of encountering those industrious gentlemen who have been lately somewhat
notorious in these parts; and it may be better for all of us to ride in as strong a party as
possible."

"Sir," replied Walter, eyeing in his turn the speaker, and in his turn also feeling satisfied
with the scrutiny, "I am going to--, where I shall pass the night on my way to town; and shall
be very happy in your company."

The Corporal uttered a loud hem; that penetrating man of the world was not too well pleased
with the advances of a stranger.

"What fools them boys be!" thought he, very discontentedly; "howsomever, the man does seem
like a decent country gentleman, and we are two to one: besides, he's old, little, and--augh,
baugh--I dare say, we are safe enough, for all he can do." 

And were liberally his people could boast yet be so as all. How remarkable that we may have somewhat

"Indeed, Sir," said Walter, "I should not, to look at you, imagine that you suffered under
any complaint. You seem still the same picture of health, that my uncle describes you to have
been when you knew him so many years ago."

"Yes, Sir, yes; the confounded malaria fixed the colour to my cheeks; the blood is stagnant,
Sir. Would to God I could see myself a shade paler!-- the blood does not flow; I am like a
pool in a citizen's garden, with a willow at each corner;--but a truce to my complaints. You
see, Sir, I am no hypochondriac, as my fool of a doctor wants to persuade me: a hypochondriac
shudders at every breath of air, trembles when a door is open, and looks upon a window as the
entrance of death. But I, Sir, never can have enough air; thorough draught or east wind, it
is all the same to me, so that I do but breathe. Is that like hypochondria?--pshaw! But tell
me, young gentleman, about your uncle; is he quite well,--stout,-- hearty,--does he breathe
easily,--no oppression?"

"Sir, he enjoys exceedingly good health: he did please himself with the hope that I should
give him good tidings of yourself, and another of his old friends whom I accidentally saw yesterday,--Sir
Peter Hales."

"Hales, Peter Hales!--ah! a clever little fellow that: how delighted Lester's good heart will
be to hear that little Peter is so improved;--no longer a dissolute, harum-scarum fellow, throwing
away his money, and always in debt. No, no; a respectable steady character, an excellent manager,
an active member of Parliament, domestic in private life,--Oh! a very worthy man, Sir, a very
worthy man!"

"He seems altered indeed, Sir," said Walter, who was young enough in the world to be surprised
at this eulogy; "but is still agreeable and fond of anecdote. He told me of his race with you
for a thousand guineas."

"Ah, don't talk of those days," said Mr. Courtland, shaking his head pensively, "it makes me
melancholy. Yes, Peter ought to recollect that, for he has never paid me to this day; affected
to treat it as a jest, and swore he could have beat me if he would. But indeed it was my fault,
Sir; Peter had not then a thousand farthings in the world, and when he grew rich, he became
a steady character, and I did not like to remind him of our former follies. Aha! can I offer
you a pinch of snuff?--You look feverish, Sir; surely this room must affect you, though you
are too polite to say so. Pray open that door, and then this window, and put your chair right
between the two. You have no notion how refreshing the draught is."

Walter politely declined the proffered ague, and thinking he had now made sufficient progress
in the acquaintance of this singular non- hypochondriac to introduce the subject he had most
at heart, hastened to speak of his father.

"I have chanced, Sir," said he, "very unexpectedly upon something that once belonged to my
poor father;" here he showed the whip. "I find from the saddler of whom I bought it, that the
owner was at your house some twelve or fourteen years ago. I do not know whether you are aware
that our family have heard nothing respecting my father's fate for a considerably longer time
than that which has elapsed since you appear to have seen him, if at least I may hope that
he was your guest, and the owner of this whip; and any news you can give me of him, any clue
by which he can possibly be traced, would be to us all--to me in particular- -an inestimable
obligation."

"Your father!" said Mr. Courtland. "Oh,--ay, your uncle's brother. What was his Christian name?--Henry?"

"Geoffrey."

"Ay, exactly; Geoffrey! What, not been heard of?--his family not know where he is? A sad thing,
Sir; but he was always a wild fellow; now here, now there, like a flash of lightning. But it
is true, it is true, he did stay a day here, several years ago, when I first bought the place.
I can tell you all about it;--but you seem agitated,--do come nearer the window:--there, that's
right. Well, Sir, it is, as I said, a great many years ago,--perhaps fourteen,--and I was speaking
to the landlord of the Greyhound about some hay he wished to sell, when a gentleman rode into
the yard full tear, as your father always did ride, and in getting out of his way I recognised
Geoffrey Lester. I did not know him well--far from it; but I had seen him once or twice with
your uncle, and though he was a strange pickle, he sang a good song, and was deuced amusing.
Well, Sir, I accosted him, and, for the sake of your uncle, I asked him to dine with me, and
take a bed at my new house. Ah! I little thought what a dear bargain it was to be. He accepted
my invitation, for I fancy--no offence, Sir,--there were few invitations that Mr. Geoffrey
Lester ever refused to accept. We dined tete-a-tete,--I am an old bachelor, Sir,--and very
entertaining he was, though his sentiments seemed to me broader than ever. He was capital,
however, about the tricks he had played his creditors,--such manoeuvres,--such escapes! After
dinner he asked me if I ever corresponded with his brother. I told him no; that we were very
good friends, but never heard from each other; and he then said, 'Well, I shall surprise him
with a visit shortly; but in case you should unexpectedly have any communication with him,
don't mention having seen me; for, to tell you the truth, I am just returned from India, where
I should have scraped up a little money, but that I spent it as fast as I got it. However,
you know that I was always proverbially the luckiest fellow in the world--(and so, Sir, your
father was!)--and while I was in India, I saved an old Colonel's life at a tiger-hunt; he went
home shortly afterwards, and settled in Yorkshire; and the other day on my return to England,
to which my ill-health drove me, I learned that my old Colonel was really dead, and had left
me a handsome legacy, with his house in Yorkshire. I am now going down to Yorkshire to convert
the chattels into gold--to receive my money, and I shall then seek out my good brother, my
household gods, and, perhaps, though it's not likely, settle into a sober fellow for the rest
of my life.' I don't tell you, young gentleman, that those were your father's exact words,--one
can't remember verbatim so many years ago;--but it was to that effect. He left me the next
day, and I never heard any thing more of him: to say the truth, he was looking wonderfully
yellow, and fearfully reduced. And I fancied at the time, he could not live long; he was prematurely
old, and decrepit in body, though gay in spirit; so that I had tacitly imagined in never hearing
of him more--that he had departed life. But, good Heavens! did you never hear of this legacy?"

"Never: not a word!" said Walter, who had listened to these particulars in great surprise.
"And to what part of Yorkshire did he say he was going?"

"That he did not mention."

"Nor the Colonel's name?"

"Not as I remember; he might, but I think not. But I am certain that the county was Yorkshire,
and the gentleman, whatever was his name, was a Colonel. Stay! I recollect one more particular,
which it is lucky I do remember. The augh did we said to hutment.

 Your father was too facetious to confine himself to fact--excuse me, Sir--and
perhaps the Colonel and the legacy were merely inventions--pour passer le temps--there was
only one reason indeed, that made me fully believe the story."

"What was that, Sir?" asked Walter, blushing deeply, at the universality of that estimation
his father had obtained.

"Excuse me, my young friend."

"Nay, Sir, let me press you."

"Why, then, Mr. Geoffrey Lester did not ask me to lend him any money."

The next morning, instead of repairing to the gaieties of the metropolis, Walter had, upon
this slight and dubious clue, altered his journey northward, and with an unquiet yet sanguine
spirit, the adventurous son commenced his search after the fate of a father evidently so unworthy
of the anxiety he had excited.

                   Quale per incertam Lunam sub luce maligna
                   Est iter.
                                --Virgil.

                   [Even as a journey by the upropitious light
                   of the uncertain moon.]

The road prescribed to our travellers by the change in their destination led them back over
a considerable portion of the ground they had already traversed, and since the Corporal took
care that they should remain some hours in the place where they dined, night fell upon them
as they found themselves in the midst of the same long and dreary stage in which they had encountered
Sir Peter Hales and the two suspected highwaymen.

Walter's mind was full of the project on which he was bent. The reader can fully comprehend
how vivid must have been his emotions at thus chancing on what might prove a clue to the mystery
that hung over his father's fate; and sanguinely did he now indulge those intense meditations
with which the imaginative minds of the young always brood over every more favourite idea,
until they exalt the hope into a passion. Every thing connected with this strange and roving
parent, had possessed for the breast of his son, not only an anxious, but so to speak, indulgent
interest. The judgment of a young man is always inclined to sympathize with the wilder and
more enterprising order of spirits; and Walter had been at no loss for secret excuses wherewith
to defend the irregular life and reckless habits of his parent. Amidst all his father's evident
and utter want of principle, Walter clung with a natural and self-deceptive partiality to the
few traits of courage or generosity which relieved, if they did not redeem, his character;
traits which, with a character of that stamp, are so often, though always so unprofitably blended,
and which generally cease with the commencement of age. He now felt elated by the conviction,
as he had always been inspired by the hope, that it was to be his lot to discover one whom
he still believed living, and whom he trusted to find amended. The same intimate persuasion
of the "good luck" of Geoffrey Lester, which all who had known him appeared to entertain, was
felt even in a more credulous and earnest degree by his son. Walter gave way now, indeed, to
a variety of conjectures as to the motives which could have induced his father to persist in
the concealment of his fate after his return to England; but such of those conjectures as,
if the more rational, were also the more despondent, he speedily and resolutely dismissed.
Sometimes he thought that his father, on learning the death of the wife he had abandoned, might
have been possessed with a remorse which rendered him unwilling to disclose himself to the
rest of his family, and a feeling that the main tie of home was broken; sometimes he thought
that the wanderer had been disappointed in his expected legacy, and dreading the attacks of
his creditors, or unwilling to throw himself once more on the generosity of his brother, had
again suddenly quitted England and entered on some enterprise or occupation abroad. It was
also possible, to one so reckless and changeful, that even, after receiving the legacy, a proposition
from some wild comrade might have hurried him away on any continental project on the mere impulse
of the moment, for the impulse of the moment had always been the guide of his life; and once
abroad he might have returned to India, and in new connections forgotten the old ties at home.
Letters from abroad too, miscarry; and it was not improbable that the wanderer might have written
repeatedly, and receiving no answer to his communications, imagined that the dissoluteness
of his life had deprived him of the affections of his family, and, deserving so well to have
the proffer of renewed intercourse rejected, believed that it actually was so. These, and a
hundred similar conjectures, found favour in the eyes of the young traveller; but the chances
of a fatal accident, or sudden death, he pertinaciously refused at present to include in the
number of probabilities. Had his father been seized with a mortal illness on the road, was
it not likely that he would, in the remorse occasioned in the hardiest by approaching death,
have written to his brother, and recommending his child to his care, have apprised him of the
addition to his fortune? Walter then did not meditate embarrassing his present journey by those
researches among the dead, which the worthy Courtland had so considerately recommended to his
prudence: should his expedition, contrary to his hopes, prove wholly unsuccessful, it might
then be well to retrace his steps and adopt the suggestion. But what man, at the age of twenty-one,
ever took much precaution on the darker side of a question on which his heart was interested?

With what pleasure, escaping from conjecture to a more ultimate conclusion--did he, in recalling
those words, in which his father had more than hinted to Courtland of his future amendment,
contemplate recovering a parent made wise by years and sober by misfortunes, and restoring
him to a hearth of tranquil virtues and peaceful enjoyments! He imaged to himself a scene of
that domestic happiness, which is so perfect in our dreams, because in our dreams monotony
is always excluded from the picture. And, in this creation of Fancy, the form of Ellinor--his
bright- eyed and gentle cousin, was not the least conspicuous. Since his altercation with Madeline,
the love he had once thought so ineffaceable, had faded into a dim and sullen hue; and, in
proportion as the image of Madeline grew indistinct, that of her sister became more brilliant.
Often, now, as he rode slowly onward, in the quiet of the deepening night, and the mellow stars
softening all on which they shone, he pressed the little token of Ellinor's affection to his
heart, and wondered that it was only within the last few days he had discovered that her eyes
were more beautiful than Madeline's, and her smile more touching. Meanwhile the redoubted Corporal,
who was by no means pleased with the change in his master's plans, lingered behind, whistling
the most melancholy tune in his collection. He must we was once usual into happening, piece out near

Sir, that makes another man's mare go your road. Augh! that must have been a cliver man as

"Never mind who it was," said Walter gravely; "use the gift discreetly."

"Umph!" said the Corporal--"yes, your honour," renewed he after a pause. "It be a marvel to

On the left side of the road was a thick and lofty hedge; to the right, a wild, bare, savage
heath, sloped downward, and just afforded a glimpse of the spires and chimneys of the town,
at which the Corporal was already supping in idea! That incomparable personage was, however,
abruptly recalled to the present instant, by a most violent stumble on the part of his hard-mouthed,
Romannosed horse. The horse was all but down, and the Corporal all but over.

Ere this rueful exclamation was well out of the Corporal's mouth, a bullet whizzed past him
from the hedge; it went so close to his ear, that but for that lucky stumble, Jacob Bunting
had been as the grass of the field, which flourisheth one moment and is cut down the next!
