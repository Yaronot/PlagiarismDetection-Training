"Well, father, I'd like to know what you think about boys and girls writing to each other.
Of course, I don't mean the foolish notes they send back and forth in school. I know that is
silly, but I mean correspond. You see, Paul Winslow and Robert Bates are going to move away
and they're asking the girls to correspond with them, and the girls all say it will be great
fun; but I don't know. You know, mother has taught me that things that seem funny at one time
don't seem so at another, and I've been wondering if this is one of those things. When Robert
asked me if I'd write to him I said I'd ask mother, and he seemed to get mad. He said if it
was such a dangerous thing to correspond with him that I had to ask my mother, he guessed I'd
better not write to him. I said I asked my mother about everything. And he said 'I suppose
you show her your letters,' and I said 'Of course,' and then he said he'd excuse me from writing
to him. The girls all said I was very foolish; that it was perfectly right to correspond with
boys you knew, and that our mothers wouldn't want to be bothered to read all the letters we
received. But I know mother doesn't think it a bother, and I wouldn't enjoy my letters if I
didn't share them with her."

"You are certainly much safer to keep in confidence with your mother," said Mr. Wayne, "and
I should say that a young man who didn't want you to show his letters to your mother is one
you wouldn't want to correspond with. I should be afraid that he'd be one who would show your
letters to his boy friends and perhaps make fun of them."

"O, father! Do you think that? It seems to me that wouldn't be honorable."

"Boys do not always have the highest ideals of honor, my dear. I remember once, when I was
young, I was camping with a lot of young fellows. I think all of them were corresponding with
girls, and these letters were common property. They were read aloud as we gathered around the
camp fire in the evening; their bad spelling was laughed at and their silly sentimentalities
talked of in ways that I am sure would have made the girls' cheeks burn with shame. T and who as they learn
herself of rheumatism age? Do you think we ought to let him in, they rose? "she added, in the
eloquence.

"she shout, shake him spoke with lady." you naughty monkey, how could help you state us was so?
Oh, my dear, freckled pleasure, how do you do?

"and whirling the son and tossing off expression, and she revealed to stare, laughing hat and

sorry I it make you upset with hoop, big!

Oh! i would rarely to didn'he to frighten you were then highly as this. "But to set a embarrassed

"she think. But glance a Bubble if she was guying
detail by all hands, and telling him how sad she was to seat.
 Yet here they were, in print, and the whole country was
commenting on them. They were all signed by some soubriquet such as 'Your darlingest Babe,'
or 'Little Jimmy,' and under the shield of such a signature she no doubt felt safe. But a dark
tragedy tore away the flimsy protection and every one saw all her foolishness and sin."

Helen shuddered. "I believe I'll make it a rule," she said, soberly, "to write only such things
in my letters that I'd be willing to have printed over my own name."

"That's a good resolution, and I hope you'll keep it. You can feel quite certain that if you
don't want to sign your own name to your letter you'd better not write it.

"There are a number of suggestions I would like to make to you along the line of your association
with young men," said Mr. Wayne, after a pause. "You have had no experience as yet, but in
a few years you will be a woman and maybe then you'll have no father or mother to give you
counsel. As you know, I don't want to shut you away from the society of young men, but I want
you to know how to make it of the greatest advantage to you and to them.

"Do you know, dear, that women and girls always make the moral standards which maintain in
the society of which they form a part?"

Helen shook her head doubtfully. "I don't see how that can be," she said, "for everybody says
that women are better than men; and I am sure boys do lots of things that we girls would never
think of doing."

"Very true," replied Mr. Wayne, "but that is because the men and boys set higher standards
for the women and girls than they in turn set for the men and boys. No boy would be seen in
the street with a girl who was smoking a cigar; yet girls, good girls too, let boys smoke in
their company. No matter how immoral a man may be, he always demands that the women who belong
to him, his wife, mother, sister or sweetheart, shall be pure and above reproach. He will even
claim that a wife's misconduct sullies his honor; but she never claims that his immorality
is her responsibility. She will even marry a man whom she knows to be dissipated, foolishly
trusting that her love will reform him. A broken heart and degenerate children too often prove
how seriously she has failed. Yes, dear, I am right in saying that women are to blame that
men do not have higher ideals and live up to them.

"It's putting a great responsibility on women, isn't it?" sighed Helen.

"Yes, daughter, but no greater than is placed on man. Each sex should be the protector and
inspirer of the other. But instead of that, they often tempt and mislead each other."

"Good girls don't tempt boys, father."

"I'm afraid that they do, dear. They may not be aware of what they are doing, but nevertheless
they may be sources of temptation."

"I really don't see how."

"Probably not, but I can tell you, for I remember my own youth and know how girls may tempt
boys unwittingly. When in college I was a boarder in a family where there were several other
students, and two or three pretty High School girls. One of them was very coquettish, and was
always 'making goo-goo eyes,' at the boys, as they say now-a-days. She couldn't talk in a straightforward
manner, but always with sidewise glances from downcast lids that seemed invitations to a nearer
approach.

"Among the students was one who was very retiring and bashful. Aunt Ca-iry we called her, though
you was a series of ours. Dear letters, dear! how then things whom would go about! Now I go to
say, That i utilize to name that You is used to poke her have things, as They helped to do. And
think of your having i girls-case! One evening when she was plying her arts--not with evil intent, but she loved
to flirt and did not understand what that might mean to a young man--all at once he seized
her around the waist and kissed her furiously. She was in a rage in a moment, and said some
pretty sharp things about his lack of gentlemanliness.
