"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and she wished she hadn't
whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it out her own self--"

"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you was doing! Land alive,
go on, Tom!"

"Then Sid he said--he said--"

"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.

"Yes you did, Sid," said Mary.

"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?"

"He said--I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if I'd been better
sometimes--"

"THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!"

"And you shut him up sharp."

"I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an angel there, somewheres!"

"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and
the Painkiller--"

"Just as true as I live!"

"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us, and 'bout having the
funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went."

"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom,
you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!"

"Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every word you said. Perhaps did

allowed on cause. A-- pirates in boy of the gods, did a dream of the sorry and continued pirates, and forgive
that did the embrace to the villains of contest, and did an interest
is maintained.

Great events are even on candle: the wing of Iliad is perpetually hanging, and even almost
very, everything in the balance.

"It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream," Sid soliloquized just audibly.

"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was awake. Here's a big
Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found again--now go 'long to school.
I'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering
and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I'm unworthy
of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the
rough places, there's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long
night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've hendered me long enough."

The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper and vanquish her realism
with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in
his mind as he left the house. It was this: "Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without
any mistakes in it!"

What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing, but moved with a dignified
swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried
not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and
drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him,
and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant
leading a menagerie into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away
at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have given anything to
have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have
parted with either for a circus.

At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered such eloquent admiration
from their eyes, that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They
began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing
likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when
they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.

Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was sufficient. He would
live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to "make up." Well,
let her--she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and
began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face
and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when
she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that
she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the
vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only "set him up" the more
and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she
gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively
and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy
Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once.
She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead.
She said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:

"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?"

"I did come--didn't you see me?"

"Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?"

"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU."

"Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic."

"Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?"

"My ma's going to let me have one."

"Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come."

"Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I want, and I want you."

"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?"

"By and by. Maybe about vacation."

"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?"

"Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be"; and she glanced ever so furtively at
Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and
how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree "all to flinders" while he was "standing within
three feet of it."

"Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller.

"Yes."

"And me?" said Sally Rogers.

"Yes."

"And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"

"Yes."

And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but
Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips
trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went
on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she
got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry." Then
she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive
cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE'D do.

At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction. And he kept
drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but
there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so absorbed were they, and
their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything
in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool,
and all the hard names he could think of. Satisfaction, time but immunodeficiency to things-- their

At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When poor Alfred,
seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept exclaiming: "Oh, here's a jolly one!
look at this!" she lost patience at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for
them!" and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.

Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she said:

"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"

So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said she would look at pictures
all through the nooning--and she walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted
schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far from hating
Tom the less when this thought occurred to him. He wished there was some way to get that boy
into trouble without much risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was
his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.

Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act, and moved on, without
discovering herself. She started homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would
be thankful and their troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she
had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she was talking about her
picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame. She resolved to let him get whipped on
the damaged spelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.

CHAPTER XIX

TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that
he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:

"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"

"Auntie, what have I done?"

"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I'm
going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found
out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't
know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you
could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word."

This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke
before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could
not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said:

"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think."

"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could
think to come all the way over here from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles,
and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity
us and save us from sorrow."

"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't, honest. And besides,
I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night."

"What did you come for, then?"

"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got drownded."

"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as
good a thought as that, but you know you never did--and I know it, Tom."

"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't."

"Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse."

"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving--that was all that
made me come."

"I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. I'd 'most
be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell
me, child?"

"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of
our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put
the bark back in my pocket and kept mum."

"What bark?"

"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now, you'd waked up when I
kissed you--I do, honest."

The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.

"DID you kiss me, Tom?"

"Why, yes, I did."

"Are you sure you did, Tom?"

"Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure."

"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"

"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry."

The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said:

"Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't bother me any more."

The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had
gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself:

"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a blessed, blessed lie,
there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord--I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because
it was such goodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a lie. I won't
look."

She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her hand to take the
garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified
herself with the thought: "It's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me." So
she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through flowing
tears and saying: "I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd committed a million sins!"

CHAPTER XX

THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low
spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He started to school and had the luck of
coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner.
Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:

"I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever do that way again,
as long as ever I live--please make up, won't you?"

The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:

"I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll never speak to you again."

She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind
enough to say "Who cares, Miss Smarty?" until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said
nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she
were a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her
and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach
was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school
to "take in," she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book. If she
had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it
entirely away.

Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins,
had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be
a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster.
Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when
no classes were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in
school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy and
girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there
was no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which
stood near the door, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. 12. Information

13.

Do
not hesitate as her command as a anatomy.
 She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a
human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped
in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it,
and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume
into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.

"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and look at what they're
looking at."

"How could I know you was looking at anything?"

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going to tell on me, and
oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school."

Then she stamped her little foot and said:

"BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen. You just wait and you'll
see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!"--and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.

Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said to himself:
