IGNORANCE OF OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES.

Thus it appears to be with granting patents and premiums, if we take what has been patented
and praised by our committees and officers as improvements in bee-culture. These men may be
capable, intelligent, and well fitted for their sphere, but in bee matters, about as capable
of judging, as the Hottentot would be of the merits of an intricate steam-engine. Knowledge
and experience are the only qualifications competent to decide.

OPPOSITION TO SIMPLICITY.

I am aware that among the thousands whose direct interest is opposed to my simple, plain manner
of getting along, many will be ready to contend with me for every departure from their patent,
improved or premium hives, as the case may be.

BY GAINING ONE POINT, PRODUCE ANOTHER EVIL.

I think it will be an easy matter to show that every departure from simplicity to gain one
point, is attended in another by a correspondent evil, that often exceeds the advantage gained.
That we have made vast improvements in art and science, and in every department of human affairs,
no one will deny; consequently, it is assumed we must correspondingly improve in a bee-hive;
forgetting that nature has fixed limits to the instinct of the bee, beyond which she will not go!

It will be necessary to point out the advantages and objections to these pretended improvements,
and then we will see if we cannot avoid the objections, and retain the advantages, without
the expense, by a simple addition to the common hive; because if we expect to encourage bee-keeping,
they must have better success than a neighbor of mine, who expended fifty dollars for bees
and a patent, and lost all in three years! Most bee-keepers are farmers; very few are engineers
sufficient to work them successfully. I would say to all such as do not understand the nature
of bees, adhere to simplicity until you do, and then I am quite sure you will have no desire
for a change.

FIRST DELUSION.

Probably the first delusion in the patent line originated with the idea, that to obtain surplus
honey, it was absolutely necessary to have a chamber hive. To get rid of the depredations of
mice, the suspended hive was contrived. The inclined bottom-board was then added to throw out
the worms. To prevent the combs from sliding down, the lower end was contracted.

The principle of bees rearing queens from worker-eggs when destitute, gave rise to the dividing
hive in several forms. Comb, when used several years, becomes thickened and black, and needs
changing; hence the changeable hives, Non-swarmers have been introduced to save risk and trouble.
Moth-proof hives to prevent the ravages of worms, &c., &c.

CHAMBER HIVE.

The chamber hive is made with two apartments; the lower and largest is for the permanent residence
of the bees, the upper or chamber for the boxes. Its merits are these: the chamber affords
all the protection necessary for glass boxes; considered as a cover, it is never lost. Its
demerits are inconvenience in handling; it occupies more room if put in the house in the winter;
if glass boxes are used, only one end can be seen, and this may be full when the other may
hold some pounds yet, and we cannot possibly know until it is taken out. I know we are told
to return such boxes when not full "and the bees will soon finish them," but this will depend
on the yield of honey at the time; if abundant, it will be filled; if not, they will be very
likely to take a hint, and remove below what there is in the box; whereas if the chamber was
separate from the hive, and was not a chamber but a loose cap to cover the boxes, it could
be raised at any time without disturbing a single bee, and the precise time of the boxes being
filled ascertained, (that is, when they are of glass.)

MRS. GRIFFITH'S HIVE.

Mrs. Griffith, of New Jersey, is said to have invented the suspended chamber hive with the
inclined bottom-board. One would suppose this was sufficiently inconvenient to use, and difficult
and expensive to construct.

WEEKS' IMPROVEMENT.

Yet Mr. Weeks makes an alteration, calls it an improvement, the expense is but a trifle more;
it is sufficient to be sanctioned by a patent. From front to rear, the bottom is about three
inches narrower than the top, somewhat wedge-shape; it has the merit to prevent the combs from
slipping down, when they happen to be made, to have the edges supported. The objections are,
that filth from the bees will not fall as readily to the bottom as if every side was perpendicular,
and the extra trouble in constructing.

INCLINED BOTTOM-BOARDS DO NOT THROW OUT ALL THE WORMS.

Inclined bottom-boards form the basis of one or two patents, said to be good to roll out the
worms. I can imagine a pea rolling off such a board; but a worm is not often found in a rolling
condition. Most of us know, that when a worm drops from the combs, it is like the spider, with
a thread attached above. The only way that I can imagine one to be thrown out by these boards,
is to have it dead when it strikes it, or so cold that it cannot spin a thread, and wind to
shake the board, till it rolls off. The objections to these boards are coupled with the suspended
hive, with which they are usually connected.

OBJECTIONS TO SUSPENDED HIVES.

All suspended hives must be objectionable to any one who wishes to know the true condition
of his bees at all times. Only think of the trouble of unhooking the bottom-board, and getting
down on your back, or twisting your neck till your head is dizzy, to look up among the combs,
and then see nothing satisfactory for want of light; or to lift the hive from its supporters,
and turn it over. The operation is too formidable for an indolent man, or one that has much
other business. The examination would very probably be put off till quite sure it would do
no longer, and sometimes a few days after that, when you will very often find your bees past
remedy.

SEE BEES OFTEN.

"See your bees often," is a choice recipe,--it is worth five hundred dollars at interest, even
when you have but few stocks. How necessary then that we have every facility for a close and
minute inspection. How much easier to turn up a hive that simply rests on a stand. Sometimes
it is necessary to turn the hive, even bottom up, and let the rays of the sun directly among
the combs, to see all the particulars. By this close inspection, I have often ascertained the
cause of some difficulty, and provided a remedy, thus saving a good many that in a short time
would have been lost; yet, with a little help, were as valuable as any by another year.

HALL'S PATENT.

Mr. Hall has added a lower section to his hive, about four inches deep, with two boards inside,
like the roof of a house, to discharge the worms, &c.; but as these boards would interfere
with close inspection, they are objectionable. Several other variations of inclined bottom-boards
and suspended hives have been contrived, to obtain a patent, but the objections offered will
apply to most of them. I shall not weary the reader by noticing in detail every hive that has
been patented; I think if I notice the principles of each kind, it will test his patience sufficiently.

JONES' PATENT.

Jones' dividing hive was probably suggested by this instinctive principle of the bee, viz.:
when a stock by any accident loses its queen, and the combs contain eggs or very young larvæ,
they will rear another. Now if a hive is constructed so as to divide the brood-combs, it would
seem quite certain that the half without a queen, would raise one; and we could multiply our
stocks without swarms, the trouble of hiving, and risk of their going to the woods, &c.

AN EXPERIMENT.

Several years ago, I thought I had obtained a principle that would revolutionize the whole
system of bee management. In 1840 I constructed such hives, and put in the bees to test by
actual experiment, the utility of what seemed so very plausible in theory. It would appear
that this principle suggested the same idea to Mr. Jones; perhaps with this difference: I think
he did not wait to test the plan thoroughly, before obtaining his patent in '42. One vender
of rights asserted that 63 stocks were made from one in three years; but somehow a great many
that obtained the rights, failed in their expectations. From my experiments, I think I could
guess at some of the reasons.

Mr. A.--"Well, what are the reasons? give us your experience, if you please, I am interested;
I had the right for such a hive, and had a lot made to order, that cost more money in the end
than I shall ever pay again for anything about bees."

Do not be too hasty, friend, I think I can instruct you to keep bees on principles in accordance
with their nature, which is very simple, so that if you can be induced to try again, we will
have the hives cost but little, at any rate.

REASONS OF FAILURE IN DIVIDING HIVES.

The greatest difficulty with dividing hives, appeared to be here. It must be constructed with
a partition or division to keep the combs in each apartment separate; otherwise, we make tearing
work in the division. When bees are first put into such hives, unless the swarm is very large,
and honey abundant, one apartment will be filled to the bottom before a commencement is made
in the other.

Mr. A.--"What difference can that make? It is necessary to have the hive full; if it cannot
be all filled at once, why let them fill part."

The difference is this. The first combs built by a swarm are for brood, and store-combs afterwards,
as needed; one apartment will be nearly filled with all brood-combs, and the other with store-combs
and honey. Now in the two kinds of cells there is a great difference; those for breeding are
near half an inch in length, while those for storing are sometimes two inches or more; totally
unfit for breeding; until the bees cut them off to the proper length, which they will not do,
unless compelled for want of room, consequently this side of store-combs is but little used
for brood. When such hive is divided, the chances are not more than one in four, that this
apartment will have any young bees of the proper age from which to raise a queen; if not, and
the old queen is in the part with the brood-comb, where she will be ninety-nine times in a
hundred, one half of the hive is lost for want of a queen.

Mr. A.--"Ah! I think I now understand how I lost one-half of nearly every hive I divided. I
also lost some of them in the winter; there was plenty of bees as well as honey; can you tell
the cause of this?"

I will guess that they starved.

Mr. A.--"Starved! why, I said there was plenty of honey."

I understood it, but nevertheless feel quite sure.

Mr. A.--"I would like to see that made plain; I can't understand how they could starve when
there was honey!"

CAUSE OF STARVING IN SUCH HIVES.

I said one apartment would be filled with brood-combs; this will be occupied, at least partially,
with brood as long as the yield of honey lasts; consequently, there will be but little room
for storing here, but the other side may be full throughout. The bees will take up their winter
quarters among the brood-combs. Now suppose the honey in this apartment is all exhausted during
a severe turn of cold weather, what can the bees do? If one should leave the mass and go among
the frosty combs for a supply, its fate would be as certain as starvation. Without frequent
intervals of warm weather to melt all frost on the combs, and allow the bees to go into the
other apartment for honey, they must starve.

The cost of construction is another objection to this hive, as the labor bestowed on one is
more than would finish two, that would be much better.

ADVANTAGES OF THE CHANGEABLE HIVE CONSIDERED.

The value of changeable hives is based upon the following principle:--Each young bee when it
first hatches from the egg, is neither more nor less than a worm; when it receives the necessary
food, the bees seal it over; it will then spin a cocoon, or line its cell with a coating of
silk, less in thickness than the thinnest paper: this remains after the bee leaves it. It is
evident, therefore, that after a few hundreds have been reared in a cell, and each one has
left its cocoon, that such cell must be somewhat diminished, although the thickness of a dozen
cocoons could not be measured; and this old cell needs removing, that the bees may replace
it with a new one. But how shall it be done? This is a feat for the display of ingenuity. A
common man might go about it in a very sensible, simple manner, might possibly turn the hive
over, and cut out the old combs when necessary, without knowing perhaps that the patent-vender
could sell a receipt to do the thing scientifically, the benefit of which would be many times
on the principle of a surgeon cutting off your head, to get a good chance to tie a small artery
according to system; or would show you a roundabout way of half a dozen miles to accomplish
what the same number of rods would do. Had we not ocular demonstration of the fact, we could
not suppose so many variations for the same end could be invented. But if we reward ingenuity,
it will be stimulated to great exertions. Perhaps if we describe the merits of one or two of
this class, the utility of this principle may be comprehended.

VARIATION OF THESE HIVES.

First, then, the sectional hive of various patterns has been patented; it consists generally
of about three boxes, one above another; the top of each has one large hole, or several small
ones, or cross-bars, about an inch wide, and half an inch apart; these holes or spaces allowing
the bees to pass from one box to the other. When all are full, the upper one is removed, and
an empty one put under the bottom; in this way all are changed, and the combs renewed in three
years; very easily and quietly done. This is as far as a patent-vender wishes the subject investigated;
and some of his customers have not gone beyond this point. As an offset for these advantages,
we will first look at the cost of such hive.

EXPENSE IN CONSTRUCTING CHANGEABLE HIVES.

It is as much work to construct each separate section, as a common hive; consequently, it is
three times the expense to begin with. It is objectionable for wintering bees, on the same
principle as the dividing hive. I object to it on another point: our surplus honey will never
be pure, as each section must be used for breeding, and every cell so used, will contain cocoons
corresponding to the number of bees raised.

SURPLUS HONEY WILL CONTAIN BEE-BREAD.

Also pollen, or bee-bread, is always stored in the vicinity of the young brood; some of this
will remain mixed with the honey, to please the palate with its exquisite flavor. The majority
will probably prefer all surplus honey stored in pure comb, where it will be with proper management.

I will here give a full description of a hive on this principle, as I have the description
from one of its advocates, in the Dollar Newspaper, Philadelphia: called Cutting's Patent Changeable
Hive.

DESCRIPTION OF CUTTING'S CHANGEABLE HIVE.

"The size of the changeable hive most used in this section, has an outside shell, made of inch
boards, about two feet high and sixteen and a half inches square, with a door hung in the rear.
On the inside are three boxes or drawers, which will hold about one thousand cubic inches each,
and when filled with honey, usually weigh about thirty-five pounds, which is a sufficient amount
of honey to winter a large swarm. The sides of these drawers are made of boards, about half
an inch thick; the tops and bottoms of the lower drawers and ends of the upper drawers should
be three-fourths of an inch, and the drawers should be fourteen inches high, fourteen inches
from front to rear, and six and three-fourths inches wide. Two of these drawers stand side
by side, with the third placed flatwise upon the two, with a free communication from one drawer
to another, by means of thirty three-fourth inch holes on the side of each drawer, and twenty-four
in the bottom of the upper drawer, and holes in the top and bottom of the lower drawers, to
correspond, and slides to cut off the communication when occasion may require. Thus we see
our hive may be one hive, with communication sufficiently free throughout, or we may have three
hives combined. The drawers have tubes made in them, (for the bees to pass and repass), which
are made to go through the front side of the hive. The back-side of the drawers are doors,
with glass set in them. These drawers set up from the bottom of the hive, and rest on pieces
of wood, closely fitted in such a way, as to make a space under the drawers for the dirt, dead
bees, and water, which collect in the bottom of hives in winter; between the drawers and the
outside is an air space of about one-third of an inch.

These hives, when well made and painted, will last many years, and those doing much in the
business will find it an advantage to have a few extra drawers. Having given you some idea
of the construction of the changeable hive, I will proceed to notice some of the most important
reasons why I prefer this hive to any I have yet seen. First because the hive, being constructed
upon the changeable principle, so that by taking out a full drawer, and placing an empty one
in its stead, our comb is always kept new, wherefore, the size of the bee is preserved, and
kept in a more healthy, or prosperous state, or condition, than when obliged to remain and
continue to breed, in the old comb, when the cells have become small. Secondly, because small,
late swarms may be easily united. Thirdly, because large swarms may be easily divided. Fourthly,
because however late a swarm may come off, it may be easily supplied with honey for the winter,
by taking from a full hive a surplus drawer, and placing it in the hive of the late swarm.
Fifthly, because a column of air between the drawers and the outside of the hive is a non-conductor
of both heat and cold, preventing the melting of the comb, and securing the bees against frost
and cold."

Now here is a full description of perhaps as good a hive as any of its class; it is given for
the benefit of those who wish to go miles instead of rods; they may know the road, especially
as they can have the privilege by paying for it: for myself, I had rather be excused,--why,
reading the description has nearly exhausted my patience; what should I do if I attempted to
make one?

FIRST OBJECTION, COST OF CONSTRUCTION.

The first obstacle in the way (after the right is obtained) is the construction. Let's see;
we want inch boards to make the shell, three-quarter inch boards for the tops and bottoms of
drawers, half inch for sides, hinges to hang a door, glass for back of drawers, tubes for the
egress of the bees, and slides to cut off communication. It will be necessary to get a mechanic,
and a workman too. Those 108 holes that must be bored, must match, or it is of no use to make
them. But few farmers would have the tools requisite, a still less number the skill and patience
to do it. What the cost might be by the time a hive was ready to receive the bees, I could
not say; but guess it might be some three or four dollars.

HIVES CAN BE MADE WITH LESS EXPENSE.

The one I shall recommend, without paint, will not cost, or need not, over 37-1/2 cents, with
cover, etc. Now, if we wish hives for ornament, it is well enough to expend something for the
purpose; but it is well not to refine too much, as there are limits which, if passed, will
render it unfit for bees. Therefore, when profit is an object, the extra expense will or ought
to be made up by the bees, in return for an expensive domicil. But will they do it? The merits
of the one under consideration are fully given. "First, by taking out a full drawer and putting
in an empty one in its stead, the combs are always kept new, and cells of full size." Now this
fear of bees becoming dwarfs in consequence of being reared in cells too small, has done more
mischief among the bees, and their owners' pockets, than if the fact had never been thought,
or heard of.

OLD BREEDING CELLS WILL LAST A LONG TIME.

These old cells do not need renewing half as often as has been represented. It is the interest
of these patent-venders to sell rights; this interest either blinds their eyes as to facts,
or lulls the internal monitor of right, while acquisitiveness is gratified. The same cells
can be used for breeding six or eight years, perhaps longer, and no one can tell the difference
by the size of the bees; I have two stocks now in their tenth year without renewal of comb.
A neighbor of mine kept a stock twelve years in the same combs; it proved as prosperous as
any. I have heard of their lasting twenty, and am inclined to believe it.

CELLS LARGER THAN NECESSARY AT FIRST.

The bees seem to make a provision for this emergency, the sheets of comb are farther apart
than actually necessary at first, the diameter of the cell is also a little larger than the
size of the young bee requires. Of this we are certain--great many young bees can be raised
in a cell, and not be diminished in size, sufficient to be detected. The bottom fills up faster
than at the sides, and as they do so, the bees add a little to the length, until the ends of
these cells on two parallel combs approximate too close to allow the bees to pass freely; before
which time it is unnecessary to remove comb for being old.

EXPENSE OF RENEWING COMBS.

One important item should be considered in this matter, by those who are so eager for new combs.
It is doubtful whether one in 500 ever thought of the expense of renewing comb. I find it estimated
by one writer,[2] that twenty-five lbs. of honey was consumed in elaborating about half lb.
wax. This without doubt is an over estimate, but no one will deny that some is used.

      [2] See Appendix of Cottage Bee-keeper, page 118.

BEST TO USE OLD COMBS AS LONG AS THEY WILL ANSWER.

I am satisfied of this much, from actual experience, that every time the bees have to renew
their brood-combs in a hive, they would make from ten to twenty-five lbs. in boxes, hence I
infer that their time can be more profitably employed than in constructing brood-combs every
year. I would also suggest that when combs have been once used for breeding it is the best
use they can be applied to, after that, as the cocoons render it unfit for much else than a
little wax.

METHOD FOR PRUNING WHEN NECESSARY.

But when the combs do actually need removing, I prefer the following method of pruning, to
driving the bees out entirely, as has been recommended. It can be done in about an hour. As
we are comparing the merits of different methods of getting rid of old combs, I shall give
mine here, notwithstanding it may seem a little out of place.

The best time is a little before night. The first movement is to blow under the hive some tobacco
smoke (the best means of charming them I ever found); the bees, deprived of all disposition
to sting, retreat up among the combs to get away from the smoke; now raise the hive from the
stand and carefully turn it bottom upwards, avoiding any jar, as some of the bees that were
in the top when the smoke was introduced, and did not get a taste, will now come to the bottom
to ascertain the cause of the disturbance; these should receive a share, and they will immediately
return to the top, perfectly satisfied. When so many bees are in the hive, as to be in the
way in pruning, (which if there is not it is not worth it,) get an empty hive the size of the
old one, and set it over, stopping the holes; now strike the lower hive with a hammer or stick,
lightly and rapidly, five or ten minutes, when nearly all the bees will be in the upper hive,
and set that on the stand. There being now nothing in the way, except a few scattering bees,
that I will warrant not to sting, unless you pinch or get them fast.

The broad one is very readily made from a piece of an old scythe, about 18 inches long, by
any blacksmith, by simply taking off the back, and forming a shank for a handle at the heel.
The end should be ground all on one side, and square across like a carpenter's chisel. This
is for cutting down the sides of the hive; the level will keep it close the whole length, when
you wish to remove all the combs; it being square instead of pointed or rounded, no difficulty
will be found in guiding it,--it being very thin; no combs are mashed by crowding.

The other tool is for cutting off combs at the top or any other place. It is merely a rod of
steel three-eighths of an inch diameter, about two feet long, with a thin blade at right angles,
one and a half inches long, and a quarter inch wide, both edges sharp, upper side bevelled,
bottom flat, &c. You will find these tools very convenient; be sure and get them by all means,
the cost cannot be compared to the advantages.

Now with the tools just described, proceed to remove the brood-combs from the centre of the
hive. The combs near the top and outside are used but little for breeding, and are generally
filled with honey; these should be left as a good start for refilling, but take out all that
is necessary, while you are about it; then reverse the hives, putting the one containing the
bees under the other; by the next morning all are up; now put it on the stand, and this job
is done without one cent extra expense for a patent to help you, and the bees are much better
off for the honey left, which has to be taken away with all patent plans that I have seen,
and this, as has been remarked, is not worth much, occupied as it is with a few cocoons and
bee-bread. It is worth much more to the bees, and they will give us pure comb and honey for it.

USE OF TOBACCO SMOKE.

"I would not do it for fifty dollars, the bees would sting me to death." Stop a moment, if
you never tried the efficacy of tobacco smoke, you know nothing of a powerful agent; this is
the grand secret of success; without it, I admit it would be somewhat hazardous; but with it,
I have done it time after time without receiving a single sting, and no protection whatever,
for either hands or face.

But is there no difficulty with our sectional or changeable hive, when this feat is to be performed?
The combs will be made in the two drawers similar to the dividing hive, brood-combs in one
side, and store-combs in the other. We wish to remove the one with brood-combs of course, (as
that is the one where the combs are thick and bad, &c.) Where will the queen be? With the brood-comb,
where her duty is most likely to be; well, this is the one we want, and we take it out. How
is she to get back? She must go back, or we have three chances in four of losing the stock;
but her majesty will remain perfectly easy, as well as some of the workers, wherever you put
the drawer.

FURTHER OBJECTIONS TO A SECTIONAL HIVE.

I can see no other way but to break the box, look her up, and help the helpless thing home,
(the chances of being stung may be here too.) Now, for a time at least, they must use the other
drawer for breeding, where most of the cells are unfit. There is altogether too great a proportion
of drone-cells; these, as well as the other size, will nearly all be much too long, and will
have to be cut off to the proper length, a waste of wax as well as labor. Another thing might
be set down per disadvantage of Mr. Cutting's hive; the job of getting a swarm into such hive,
at first, I fancy would not be desirable to many. Now, when we strike the balance, putting
expense, difficulties, and perplexities on one side, and simplicity and economy on the other,
it appears like a "great cry for little wool." But stop a moment, four other advantages are
enumerated in its favor: second, third, and fourth are borrowed from the common hive, or are
all available here when required.

NON-SWARMERS.

Here I will endeavor to be brief; I feel anxious to get through with this disagreeable part,
where every word I say will clash with somebody's interest or prejudice. The merits of this
hive are to obtain surplus honey with but little trouble, which often succeeds in satisfying
people of its utility. The principal objection is found on the score of profit. Suppose we
start with one, call it worth five dollars in the beginning, at the end of ten years it is
worth no more, very likely not as much, (the chances of its failing, short of that time, we
will not take into the account;) we might get annually, say five dollars worth of surplus honey,
amounting to fifty dollars.

CONTRAST OF PROFIT.

The swarming hive, we suppose, will throw off one swarm annually, and make us one dollar's
worth of surplus honey, (we will not reckon that yielded by the first swarm, which is often
more than that from the old stocks,) about one third of the average in good seasons. The second
year there will be two to do the same; take this rate for ten years, we have 512 stocks, either
of them worth as much as the non-swarmer, and about a thousand dollars worth of surplus honey.
Call these stocks worth five dollars each, which makes $2,560, all added together will make
the snug little sum of about $3,500, against $55. It is not to be expected that any of us will
realize profits to this extent, but it is a forcible illustration of the advantages of the
swarming hive over the non-swarmer.

PRINCIPLE OF SWARMING NOT UNDERSTOOD.

But many of these non-swarmers, 'tis said, can be changed to swarmers to suit the convenience
of the apiarian--Colton's is one. It is asserted that it can be made to swarm within two days
at any time, merely by taking off the six boxes or drawers that are very ingeniously attached;
as this contracts the room, the bees are forced out. Now I will candidly confess that I could
never get this thing to work at all. Of this I am quite positive, that he (Mr. Colton) is either
ignorant of the necessary and regular preparations that bees make before swarming, or supposes
others are. Mr. Weeks has advocated the same principle: he says, "There is no queen in any
stage of existence, in the old stock, immediately after the first swarm leaves it." I have
examined this matter till I am satisfied I risk but little in the bold assertion, that not
one stock in fifty will cast a swarm short of a week after commencing preparations. This opinion
will be adopted by whoever will take the trouble to investigate for themselves. (The chapter
on swarming will give the necessary instructions for examining this point, if you wish.)

NOT TO BE DEPENDED UPON.

Further, these non-swarmers are not always to be depended upon as such. They will sometimes
throw off swarms when there is abundant room in the hive as well as in the boxes.

HIVES NOT ALWAYS FULL BEFORE SWARMING.

I know Weeks, Colton, Miner and others, tell us the hive must be full before we need expect
a swarm; but experience is against them. Bees do sometimes cast a swarm before filling the
hive. From close observation, I find when a hive is very large, say 4,000 cubic inches, and
is filled with comb, the first season, that such seldom swarm except in very good years.

SIZE OF HIVES NEEDED.

But if such hive is only half full, or 2,000 inches, it is very common for them to swarm without
adding any new comb; proving very conclusively that a hive that size, is sufficient for all
their wants in the breeding season. When about 1,200 inches only had been filled the first
year, I have known them to add combs until they had filled about 1,800, and then cast a swarm,
proving also that a little less than 2,000 will do for breeding. I have tested the principle
of giving room to prevent swarming, a little further.

AN EXPERIMENT.

In the spring of '47, I placed under five full hives, containing 2,000 solid or cubic inches,
as many empty ones, the same size, without the top. I had a swarm from each; but two had added
any new comb, and these but little. If these hives had been filled to the bottom with comb
in the spring, it is very doubtful whether either of them would have swarmed. The only place
we can put a good stock and not expect it to swarm in good seasons, is inside a building, where
it is perfectly dark, and even here a few have been known to do it. If we could manage to get
a very large hive filled with combs, it would perhaps be as good a preventive as any. All the
bees that could be reared in one season, would have sufficient room in the combs ready made
for their labors, and there would be no necessity for their emigration. "But what becomes of
all the bees raised in the course of several years?" To this question I shall not probably
be able to give a satisfactory answer at present.

BEES DO NOT INCREASE, IF FULL, AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, IN SAME HIVE.

I only will notice the fact, that the bees somehow disappear, and there is no more at the end
of five years than at the end of one. A stock of bees may contain 6,000 the first of May, and
raise 20,000 in the course of the year; by the first of the next May, as a general thing, not
one more will be found, even when no swarm had issued.

GILLMORE'S SYSTEM DOUBTED.

Now this fact is not known by a recent patentee from the State of Maine, (else he supposes
others do not,) as he recommends placing bees in a house, and empty hives in connection with
the one containing bees, and in a few years all will be full. He has discovered a mixture to
feed bees, (to be noticed hereafter); this may account for an unusual quantity being stored
by an ordinary sized family. He said another thing, that is, each of these added hives would
contain a queen! This would seem to explain away the first difficulty of the continued increase
of bees, and so it would if it did not get into another equally erroneous; one error never
made another true. This idea of bees raising a queen, merely because they have a side box to
the main hive, is contrary to all my experience, and to the experience of all writers (except
himself) that I have consulted. If the principle is correct, why not sometimes raise a queen
in a box on the top or side for us? I never discovered a single instance, where two perfect
queens were quietly about their duties in connection with one hive. The deadly hostility of
queens is known to all observing apiarians. Not having the least faith in the principle, I
will leave it.

UTILITY OF MOTH-PROOF HIVES DOUBTED.

As for moth-proof hives, I have but little to say, as I have not the least faith in one of
them. When I come to speak of that insect, I will show, I think, conclusively, that no place
where bees are allowed to enter is safe from them.

Several other perfect hives might be mentioned; yet I believe that I have noticed the principles
of each. Have I not said enough? Such as are not satisfied now would not be if I filled a volume.
Our view of things is the result of a thousand various causes; the most powerful is interest,
or prejudice.

.
 Dr. Bevan's and Miner's cross-bar hives are objectionable
on this account, they offer too free access to the boxes; we want all the room that will answer,
and no more.

A SUGGESTION.

Mr. Miner's cross-bar hive is intended to make the bees construct all straight combs, and probably
will do it. But the disadvantage of bee-bread and brood in the boxes will not be made up by
straight combs.

For the benefit of those who have been made to believe straight combs all important, and perhaps
have purchased the right to make the hive, and had some constructed, and have found bee-bread
in their surplus honey, I would suggest an improvement, (that is, if it is thought the straight
combs will pay. If you have not the right for the cross-bar hive, and you wish to use it, I
would say, buy the right, and remove all grounds of complaint with him.) Put in the bars and
hive your bees as he directs. After all the combs are started, instead of setting the open
bottom boxes (which are also unsuitable for sending to market) directly on the bars as he recommends,
take off the cloth, and with screws fasten on a top with ten holes, that I have just described;
and then you will have the straight combs, and surplus honey in the boxes pure.

GLASS BOXES PREFERRED.

Having told how I make a hive, I will now give some reasons for preferring a particular kind
of boxes. I have taken great quantities of honey to market, put up in every style, such as
tumblers, glass jars, glass boxes, wooden boxes with glass ends, and boxes all wood. I have
found the square glass boxes the most profitable; the honey in such appears to the best possible
advantage, so much so, that the majority of purchasers prefer paying for the box at the same
rate as the honey, than the wood box, and have the tare allowed. This rate of selling boxes
always pays the cost, while we get nothing for the wood. Another advantage in this kind of
boxes is, while being filled, the progress can be watched, and the time they are finished known
precisely, when they should be taken off, as every day they remain after that, soils the purity
of the combs.

GLASS BOXES--HOW TO MAKE.

Directions for making.--Select half-inch boards of pine or other soft light wood, cut the length
twelve and three-quarters inches, width six and three-eighths inches, dress down the thickness
to three-eighths or less, two pieces for a box, top and bottom, in the bottom bore five holes
throughout the centre to match with those in the top of the hive, (the pattern used in marking
the top of hives is just the one to mark these). Next, get out the corner posts, five-eighths
of an inch square, and five inches in length; with a saw, thick enough to fit the glass, cut
a channel length-wise on two sides, one-fourth of an inch deep, one-eighth from the corner,
for the glass. A small lath nail through each corner of the bottom into the posts will hold
them; it is now ready for the glass--10×12 is the right size to get--have them cut through
the centre the longest way for the sides, and they are right, and again the other way, five
and five-eighths long for the ends. These can now be slipped into the channels of the posts,
and the top nailed on like the bottom, and the box is ready.

GUIDE-COMBS NECESSARY.

It will be found a great advantage, previous to nailing on the top, to stick fast to it some
pieces of guide-combs in the direction you wish the bees to work. They are also an inducement
for them to commence several days sooner, than if they had to start combs for themselves;[5]
a piece an inch square will do; it is well to start every comb you want in the box; two inches
apart is about the right distance to look well. To make these pieces hold fast, melt one edge
by the fire, or candle, or melt some bees-wax, and dip one edge in that, and apply it before
cooling; with a little practice you can make them stick without difficulty. For a supply of
such combs, save all empty, clean, white pieces you can, when removing combs from a hive.

      [5] A line of bees-wax made with a guide-plate, or other means,
      is found to be of but little use.

If you have any way superior to this for making glass boxes, so much the better, make them
so by all means: "The best way is as good as any." I give my method to be used only when better
is not convenient. If you sell honey, I think you will find it an advantage to have glass boxes
made in some way. Two of this size when full weigh 25 lbs. If preferred, four boxes six and
three-eighths inches square, can be used for a hive instead of two; the expense of making is
a little more for the same number of lbs., yet, when it is in market, a few customers will
prefer this size.

WOOD BOXES.

For home consumption, the wood-box will answer equally well for all purposes of obtaining the
honey, but will give no chance to watch the progress of the bees, unless a glass is inserted
for the purpose, and then it will need a door to keep it dark, or a cover over the whole like
the one for glass boxes, may be put on. Wood boxes are generally made with open bottom, and
set on the top of the hive. A passage for the bees out of the box to the open air is unnecessary,
and worse than useless. They like to store their honey as far from the entrance as possible.
Unless crowded for room, they will not store much there when such entrances are made.

Whether we intend to consume our surplus honey or not, it is as well to have the hives and
covers made in a manner that we can use glass, when we are likely to have some to spare. I
am not sure, but it would pay to make hives in this way, even if glass boxes were never used;
the rabbeting prevents light as well as water from passing under the cover; imagine a box set
on a plain board nailed on for a top, without the rabbeting; the warping or bending admits
the light and water, especially when hives are out in the weather, (and I shall not recommend
any other way of keeping them.)

COVER FOR HIVES.

I have termed the cap or box a cover; but this should also be covered with a board laid on,
if nothing else. A good roof for each hive can be made by fastening two boards together like
the roof of a building; let it be about 18 by 24 inches; it being loose, can be changed in
accordance with the season; in spring, let the sun strike the hive; but in hot weather let
the longest end project over the south side, &c. You can ornament this hive, if you choose,
by mouldings or dentals, under the top, where it projects over the body of the hive, also the
cap can have the top projected a little and receive the same addition.

JARS AND TUMBLERS--HOW PREPARED.

When jars, tumblers, or other vessels, that are all glass, are used, it is absolutely necessary
to fasten as many pieces of combs as you wish made, in the top, for a beginning, or fasten
a piece of wood there; as they seldom commence building on glass, without a start.

Some of you may have seen paraded at our fairs, or in the public parts of some of our cities,
hives containing tumblers, some of them neatly filled, others empty, and this meagre sentence
written upon them, not to be filled! Pretending to govern the bees, as the juggler sometimes
does his tricks, by mysterious incantations! I once encountered an agent of this humbug, and
modestly suggested to him that I had a counter charm: that I could put a tumbler on his hive
and it would be filled if the others were, however much he might forbid it by written charms!
He saw at a glance how the matter stood; I was not the customer he wanted, and intimated that
the show was only intended for the extreme verdancy of most visitors. It no doubt assisted
in displaying his profound knowledge in bee management, which he wished to establish, as he
had a little work on the subject to sell, also hives, and bees. The reader no doubt will guess
as I did, the reason that those tumblers were not filled, was because no combs were put in
for a start.

PERFECT OBSERVATORY HIVE DESCRIBED.

There are many things pertaining to bees that cannot be properly examined and understood, without
a glass hive of some sort. Yet a perfect observatory hive containing but one comb, is not a
perfect hive for the bees. We can see very well what the bees are doing, but it is not a tenement
they would choose if left to themselves. It forces them to labor in an unnatural manner, is
unsuitable for wintering bees, and otherwise but little profit. If the satisfaction of witnessing
some of their operations more perfectly than in glass hives of another kind will not pay, it
is doubtful if we get it. I will describe as briefly as possible. Two frames or sashes about
two and a half feet square, containing glass, are so fastened together as to leave room for
only one comb between them, about an inch and three-fourths apart. A comb of this size will
not support itself by the top and edges; hence, it is necessary to put in numerous cross-bars
to assist in supporting it. Outside the glass are doors to keep the whole dark, to be opened
when we wish to inspect proceedings. Under the bottom is a board or frame, to keep it in an
upright position, &c. Probably but few will be induced to make one. I will therefore describe
another; a hive that I think will pay better.

ONE LIKE COMMON HIVE PREFERRED.

If we expect to know what bees are doing in ordinary hives, we must have one similar in every
respect, in size, shape, number of bees, &c. The construction of royal cells will be watched
by most observers with the greatest interest; now these are generally on one edge of the combs.
The bees leave a space half an inch or more between the edges of the combs and one side of
the hive, near half the length of it, apparently for no other purpose but to have room for
these cells, as the other edges of the same combs are generally attached to the hive at the bottom.

WHAT MAY BE SEEN.

Now instead of having one piece or pane of glass in the side of several hives, I would recommend
having one or more with glass on every side; because we might have it on three sides, and not
the fourth; and this might contain all the queen cells, and we should miss an important sight.
There are many other things to be witnessed in such a hive. The queen may be often seen depositing
her eggs! We may see the workers detach the scales of wax from their abdomen, and apply them
to the combs during the process of construction, see them deposit pollen from their legs, store
their honey, feed the queen, each other, their young brood, seal over cells containing brood,
honey, &c. It is further useful as a guide for putting boxes on other hives, (that is, if it
is a good one, which it should be); we can easily ascertain whether our bees are gaining or losing.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING GLASS HIVE.

My method of making them is as follows: The top is like those for other hives, fifteen inches
square, adapted to boxes and cover. This hive we want to be as profitable as any, giving us
surplus honey, and swarms like others. Four posts are then got out, two inches square, and
thirteen in length; care should be taken to have the ends perfectly square.

A frame is then to be made, just fourteen inches square outside, for the bottom; the pieces
are one inch thick, by two in width, halved together at the corners. A guage-mark is then made
around the under side of the top, half an inch from the edge, a post is then set inside of
each corner of this mark, and thoroughly nailed, the bottom is nailed on with the posts even
with the outside corners. Four pieces an inch thick, and an inch and a half wide, are fitted
between the posts, even with the guage-mark on the top. Sixteen strips, about one quarter by
half an inch, are got out, eight to be ten, and eight twelve inches long.

A gauge-mark one inch from posts, bottom, &c., is the place to nail these strips; very small
nails or tacks will hold them. The panes of glass are to rest against them, which are held
in their places by small pieces of tin, or brads. The doors are the size of the glass, 10×12,
about three-fourths of an inch thick; these doors are cut a little too short, and the pieces,
to prevent warping, are nailed on the ends; these are hung to a post on one side, and secured
by a button on the other. On two opposite sides inside the posts, half way up, two strips,
half an inch by three quarters, are nailed, with holes in them for the cross-sticks; one way
is enough if you have guide-combs for a start, like those recommended for boxes, so that the
sheets will be at right angles with them; otherwise, let the sticks cross both ways, about
three each way will be needed, as the glass at the edges is not so good a support as wood.

The cap can be made of half inch boards; the top to project over like the hive, or let it be
a little more than half an inch, it will admit a heavier moulding, which should surround it
here, as well as at the top of the hive, or if it is prefered, dentals can be used, and look
equally well--when no ornament is wanted, omit it. But painting seems necessary for such hives,
to prevent warping, and the swelling of the doors in wet weather; these want to open and shut
without rubbing or sticking, otherwise we disturb the bees every time a door is stirred. Putty
should not be used to hold the glass, as the bees in the course of a few years will cover it
with propolis; it is then necessary to take it out, and scrape, clean, and return it, when,
if fastened with putty, it would be difficult; cold weather is the time for this operation.
I am aware that a hive can be more substantially made than the one here described; but I have
endeavored to make one as cheap as possible, and if properly made, will answer. The cost will
be much less than many patents, and the satisfaction much more, at least, with many. When our
hive contains a swarm of bees, and they are thoroughly in operation, we must not let them pass
out at the bottom on every side, as they are frequently allowed to do from other hives; because,
should one come out a little excited in consequence of a slight jar, accidentally given the
hive, on opening the door or some other way, and should find our face within a foot of their
house, peering in the window among their works, it would be very likely to give us a gentle
hint that it was a mark of low breeding, that we were not wanted there at all, and that it
was none of our business what they were doing. To prevent this as far as possible, a bottom-board,
somewhat different from the common one, is needed. Four posts of chestnut or other lasting
wood, about two inches square, are driven into the earth in the form of a square, far enough
apart to come under the corners of the bottom-board, (fifteen inches,) and high enough for
convenience when looking into the hive. The ends of these posts are to be perfectly level,
and to which the bottom is to be nailed fast. As the hive is to sit perfectly close to the
board, a passage must be made through it, as well as means for ventilation in hot weather,
without raising the hive for that purpose. It requires a board about fifteen inches square,
planed smooth, the ends clamped to prevent warping or splitting; a portion of the centre is
taken out, say six inches by ten, and wire cloth nailed over, four-ounce tacks will hold it,
fasten it just enough to keep the bees from getting through; very likely it will want to be
taken off occasionally and cleaned from the propolis that will be spread over it. It is easiest
done in freezing weather.

Take an edge in each hand, and rock the wires a few times out of square, and it will readily
crumble and fall out. In warm weather it must be scalded or burnt off. To close this space,
a moving slide is fixed in grooves under-side, fastened to the posts or board. The slide is
to be moved in accordance with the weather, when cold, close it, when hot, withdraw it, and
give the bees as much air as possible, without raising the hive, the whole of such space is
as much ventilation as ordinary hives raised an inch. (Wire cloth is needed for other purposes,
it is best to procure some, even at considerable trouble and expense.) On the side of the board
intended for the front, two inches from the edge of the wire cloth, a passage is cut for the
bees, three-eights of an inch wide, by eleven in length. "But how is the bees to get to this
place, so inconvenient, something is needed to assist them?" Certainly, Sir; an alighting board,
eleven inches wide, and about two feet long, (not planed), is placed at an angle of forty-five
degrees, between the two front posts of your stand, the upper end passing under the bottom,
far enough back; to be just even with the back-side of the passage for the bees. The bees alight
on this board, and walk up into the hive without difficulty. When the bees are at work pretty
freely, and a door of this hive is opened, those that are about departing will be very likely
to get on the glass, instead of through the opening at the bottom; seeing the light through
the glass, they endeavor to escape by the nearest route. When so many gather here as to prevent
a good view, and you wish to observe further, shut the door a moment and they will leave through
their own passage, when you can open your door again, for a short time. After the hive is filled
with combs, the number attracted to the glass on opening a door will be much less.

The plate on the preceding page represents a glass hive, cover, and stand. The common hive
can be made equally ornamental, if you choose; this kind of stand is unnecessary for them.
I use such as are recommended on page 138.

CHAPTER III.

BREEDING.

IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD.

The time that bees commence raising their young brood is but imperfectly understood by most
people. Many persons that have kept them for years, have bestowed so little attention on this
point, that they are unable to tell at what time they commence, how they progress, or when
they cease. A kind of an idea that one swarm, and occasionally two or three, are reared sometime
in June, or fore part of summer, is about the extent of their reflections on the subject. Whether
the drones deposit the eggs, or that a portion of the workers are females, and each raise a
young one or two, or whether the "king bee" is the chap for laying eggs, is a matter beyond
their ability to answer. It is but a few years since, that a correspondent of a Journal of
Agriculture denied the existence of a queen bee, giving the best reasons he had, no doubt,
that is, he had never seen one. But bee-keepers of this class are so few, it is unnecessary
to waste time to convince them; suffice it to say, that a queen exists with every prosperous
swarm, and all apiarians with much pretensions to science, acknowledge the fact, also, that
she is the mother of the whole family.

The period at which they commence depositing eggs probably depends on the strength of the colony,
amount of honey on hand, &c., and not the time they commence gathering food.

GOOD STOCK SELDOM WITHOUT BROOD.

I once removed the bees from a hive on the tenth of January, and found brood amounting to about
five hundred, sealed over, and others in every stage of growth down to the egg.

This hive had been in the house, and kept warm; it will doubtless be supposed that being kept
warm was the cause; but this is not a solitary instance. A neighbor lost a hive the fourteenth
February, in weather cold enough to seal the entrance with ice, and smother the bees. I assisted
to remove the combs, and found young brood in abundance, from the perfect bee, through all
stages of growth. This stock had been in the cold all winter. I have further noticed, when
sweeping out the litter under the hives early in spring, say the first of March, that young
bees would often be found under the best stocks. Hence it appears there is but little time,
and perhaps none, when our best stocks have no broods. Yet stocks, when very weak, do not commence
till warm weather. It seems that a certain degree of warmth is necessary to perfect the brood,
which a small family cannot generate.

HOW SMALL STOCKS COMMENCE.

The first eggs are deposited in the centre of the cluster of bees, in a small family; it may
not be in the centre of the hive in all cases; but the middle of the cluster is the warmest
place, wherever located. Here the queen will first commence; a few cells, or a space not larger
than a dollar, is first used, those exactly opposite on the same comb are next occupied. If
the warmth of the hive will allow, whether mild weather produces it, or the family be large
enough to generate that which is artificial, appears to make no difference; she will then take
the next combs exactly corresponding with the first commencement but not quite as large a place
is used as in the first comb. The circle of eggs in the first is then enlarged, and more are
added in the next, &c., continuing to spread to the next combs, keeping the distance to the
outside of the circle of eggs, to the centre or place of beginning, about equal on all sides,
until they occupy the outside comb. Long before the outside comb is occupied, the first eggs
deposited are matured, and the queen will return to the centre, and use these cells again,
but is not so particular this time to fill so many in such exact order as at first. This is
the general process of small or medium sized families. I have removed the bees from such, in
all stages of breeding, and always found their proceedings as described.

DIFFERENT WITH LARGER ONES.

But with very large families, their proceedings are different: as any part of the cluster of
bees is warm enough for breeding, there is less necessity for economizing heat, and having
all the eggs confined to one small spot, some unoccupied cells will be found among the brood;
a few will contain honey and bee-bread.

HOW POLLEN IS STORED IN THE BREEDING SEASON.

But in the height of the breeding season, a circle of cells nearly all bee-bread, an inch or
two wide, will border the sheets of comb containing brood. As bee-bread is probably the principal
food of the young bee, it is thus very convenient.

When pollen is abundant, and the swarm is in prosperous condition, they soon reach the outside
sheets of comb with the brood. At this period, when the hive is about full, and the queen is
forced to the outside combs to find a place for her eggs, it is interesting to witness operations
in a glass hive. I have seen her several times during one day, on the same piece of comb (next
the glass). The light has no immediate effect on her "Highness," as she will quietly continue
about her duty, not the least embarrassed by curious eyes at the window. Before depositing
an egg, she enters the cell head first, probably to ascertain if it is in proper condition
to receive it; as a cell part filled with bee-bread or honey is never used. If the area of
combs is small, or the family is small, and cannot protect a large space with the necessary
heat, she will often deposit two, and sometimes three, in one cell (the supernumeraries I suppose
are removed by the workers). But under prosperous circumstances, with a hive of suitable size,
&c., this emergency is avoided.

OPERATION OF LAYING AND THE EGGS DESCRIBED.

When a cell is in a condition to receive the egg, on withdrawing her head she immediately curves
her abdomen, and inserts it a few seconds. After leaving it, an egg may be seen attached by
one end to the bottom; about the sixteenth of an inch in length, slightly curved, very small,
nearly uniform the whole length, abruptly rounded at the ends, semi-transparent, and covered
with a very thin and extremely delicate coat, often breaking with the slightest touch.

After the egg has been about three days in the cell, a small white worm may be seen coiled
in the bottom, surrounded with a milky-like substance, which is its food, without doubt. How
this food is prepared, is merely guess-work. The hypothesis of its being chiefly composed of
pollen, I have no objection to; as it is sufficiently proved by the quantities that accumulate
in hives that lose their queen, and rear no brood (that is, when a requisite number of workers
are so left). The workers may be seen entering the cell every few minutes, probably, to supply
this food.[6]

      [6] When the comb in our glass hive is new, and white, these
      operations can be seen more distinctly than when very old and
      dark.

TIME FROM THE EGG TO THE PERFECT BEE.

In about six days it is sealed over with a convex waxen lid. It is now hidden from our sight
for about twelve days, when it bites off the cover, and comes forth a perfect bee. The period
from the egg to the perfect bee varies from twenty to twenty-four days; average about twenty-two
for workers, twenty-four for drones. The temperature of the hive will vary some with the atmosphere;
it is also governed by the number of bees. A low temperature probably retards the development,
while a high one facilitates it. You may have seen accounts of the assiduous attentions given
to the young bee when it first emerges from the cell: 'tis said they "lick it all over, feed
it with honey," &c., desperately pleased with their new acquisition.

ROUGH TREATMENT OF THE YOUNG BEE.

Now, if you expect to see anything of this, you must watch a little closer than I have. I have
seen hundreds when biting their way out. Instead of care or notice, they often receive rather
rough treatment: the workers, intent on other matters, will sometimes come in contact with
one part way out the cell, with force sufficient to almost dislocate its neck; yet they do
not stop to see if any harm is done, or beg pardon. The little sufferer, after this rude lesson,
scrambles back as soon as possible out of the way; enlarges the prison door a little, and attempts
again, with perhaps the same success: a dozen trials are often made before they succeed. When
it does actually leave, it seems like a stranger in a multitude, with no friend to counsel,
or mother to direct. It wanders about uncared for and unheeded, and rarely finds one sufficiently
benevolent to bestow even the necessaries of life; but does sometimes. It is generally forced
to learn the important lesson of looking out for itself, the day it leaves the cradle. A cell
containing honey is sought for, where its immediate wants are all supplied.

GUESS WORK.

The time before it is ready to leave the hive for honey, I might guess would be two or three
days. Others have said "it would leave the day it left the cell;" but I guess they guess at
this point. They tell us, too, that after the bees seal over the cells containing the larvæ,
"they immediately commence spinning their cocoons, which takes just about thirty-six hours."
I think it very likely; but when I admit it, I cannot imagine how it was ascertained;--the
faculty of looking through a mill-stone I do not possess, and it requires about the same optical
penetration to look into one of these cells after it is sealed over, as it is all perfect darkness.
Suppose we drive away the bees and open the cell, to give us a look at the interior: the little
insect stops its labor in a moment, probably from the effect of air and light. I never could
detect one in its labor. Suppose we open these cells every hour after sealing; can we tell
anything about their progress by the appearance of these cocoons, or even tell when they are
finished? The thickness of a dozen would not exceed common writing paper. When a subject is
obscure, or difficult to ascertain, like this, why not tell us how they found out the particulars;
and if they were guessed at, be honest, and say so? When the bee leaves the cell, a cocoon
remains, and that is about all we know about it.

TERMS APPLIED TO YOUNG BEES.

The young bee, when it first leaves the egg, is termed grub, maggot, worm, or larva; from this
state it changes to the shape of the perfect bee, which is said to be three days after finishing
the cocoon; from the time of this change, till it is ready to leave the cell, the terms nymph,
pupa, and chrysalis, are applied. The lid of the drone's cell is rather more convex than that
of the worker's, and when removed by the young bee to work its way out, is left nearly perfect;
being cut off around the edges, a good coat or lining of silk keeps it whole; while the covering
of the worker's cell is mostly wax, and is pretty well cut to pieces by the time the bee gets
out. The covering to the queen's cell is like the drone's, but larger in diameter, and thicker,
being lined with a little more silk.

DISCREPANCY IN TIME IN REARING BROOD AS GIVEN BY HUBER.

We are told by most writers, the period of time necessary to perfect from the egg, the three
different kinds of bees. Huber leads the way, and the rest, supposing him to be right, repeat
in substance his account as follows: That the whole time necessary to perfect a queen from
the egg is sixteen days, the worker twenty, and the drone twenty-four days; Huber (as quoted
by Harpers) gives the time of each stage of development belonging to each kind of bee; but
is rather unfortunate in arithmetic; the items, or stages, when added together, "do not prove,"
as the school-boys say; that is, he gains time by making his bee by degrees. He says, first,
of the worker, "It remains three days in the egg, five in the grub state, it is thirty-six
hours in spinning its cocoon; in three days it changes to a nymph, passes six in that form,
and then comes forth a perfect bee." How do the items add?

    The egg,              3     days.
    Grub,                 5      "
    Spinning cocoon,      1-1/2  "
    Changing to a nymph,  3      "
    In that form,         6      "
                       -------
                        18-1/2  days.

One and a half days short. We will next see how the figures with the royal insect match; recollect
sixteen days are all she has allowed; then, of the different stages, "three days in the egg,
is five a worm, when the bees close its cell, and it immediately begins its cocoon, which is
finished in twenty-four hours. During eleven days, and even sixteen hours of the twelfth, it
remains in a state of complete repose. Its transformation into a nymph then takes place, in
which state four days and part of the fifth are passed." Now let us add the items:

    The egg,                                   3     days.
    A worm,                                    5       "
    Spinning a cocoon, (24 hours),             1       "
    Reposes eleven days and 16 hours,         11-2/3   "
    A nymph four days, and part of the fifth,  4-1/3   "
                                             -------
                                              25     days.

Now, reader, what do you make of such palpable blundering guess-work? A difference of nine
days--the merest school-boy ought to know better! Can we rely on such history? Does it not
prove the necessity of going over the whole ground, applying a test to every assertion, and
a revision of the whole matter throughout? My object is not to find fault, but to get at facts.
When I see such guess-work as the above published to the world, in this enlightened age, gravely
told to the rising generation, as a portion of natural history, I feel it a duty not to resist
the inclination to expose the absurdity.

THE NUMBER OF EGGS DEPOSITED BY THE QUEEN GUESSED AT.

The number of eggs that a queen will deposit is often another point of guess-work. When the
estimate does not exceed 200 per diem, I have no reason to dispute it; the number will probably
fall short in some cases, and exceed it in others. Some writers suppose that this number "would
never produce a swarm, as the bees that are lost daily amount to, or even exceed that number,"
and give us instead from eight hundred to four thousand eggs in a day, from one queen. The
only way to test the matter accurately, is by actually counting, in an observatory hive, or
in one with sufficient empty combs to hold all the eggs she will deposit for a few days, when,
by removing the bees, and counting carefully, we might ascertain, and yet several would have
to be examined, before we could get at the average. The nearest I ever came to knowing anything
about it happened as follows: A swarm left, and the queen from some cause was unable to cluster
with it, and was found, after some trouble, in the grass a few rods off. She was put in the
hive with the swarm about 11 o'clock, A.M.; the next morning, at sunrise, I found on the bottom-board,
among the scales of wax, 118 eggs that had been discharged in that time. Probably a few escaped
notice, as the color is the same as wax scales; also, they might already have had combs containing
some. I have several times found a few the next morning, under swarms hived the day previous,
but never over thirty, except in this one instance. The reason of this queen not being able
to fly well might have been an unusual burden of eggs. Perhaps it would be as well to mention
here, that in all cases where eggs are found in this way, that they must be first swarms which
are accompanied by the old queens.

Schirach estimates "the eggs a single female will lay, from 70,000 to 100,000 in a season."
Reaumer and Huber do not estimate so high. Another writer estimates 90,000, in three months.
Let the number be as it may, probably thousands are never perfected. During the spring months,
in medium and small families, where the bees can protect with animal heat but a few combs,
I have often found cells containing a plurality of eggs, two, three, and occasionally four,
in a single cell. These supernumeraries must be removed, and frequently may be found amongst
the dust on the bottom-board.

A TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF A QUEEN.

If you have a hive that you suspect has lost a queen at this season, her presence can be ascertained
nine times in ten by this method. Sweep off the board clean, and look the next day or two after
for these eggs. Take care that ants, or mice, have no chance to get them; they might deceive
you, being as fond of eggs for breakfast as anyone.[7] When one or more is found, or any immature
bees, it is sufficient, no further proof of the presence of a queen is needed.

      [7] It is said that the bees will devour these eggs also.

Another portion of eggs is wasted whenever a supply of their food fails; if we remove the bees
from a stock during a scarcity, when the hive is light, we will be very likely to find hundreds
of eggs in the cells, and but very few advancing from that stage towards maturity. I have thus
found it in the fall, in July, and sometimes the first of June, or at any time when maturing
the brood would be likely to exhaust their stores, to endanger the family's supply. Now, instead
of the fertility of the queen being greater in spring and first of summer than at other times,
(as we are often told), I would suggest the probability that a greater abundance of food at
this season, and a greater number of empty cells, may be the reason of the greater number of
bees matured.

WHEN DRONES ARE REARED.

Whenever the hive is well supplied with honey, and plenty of bees, a portion of eggs are deposited
in the drone-cells, which three or four days more are necessary to mature than the worker.

WHEN QUEENS ARE REARED.

Also, when the combs become crowded with bees, and honey plenty, the preparations for young
queens commence: as the first step towards swarming, from one to twenty royal cells are begun;
when about half completed, the queen (if all continues favorable) will deposit eggs in them,
these will be glued fast by one end like those for the workers; there is no doubt but they
are precisely the same kind of eggs that produce other bees. When hatched, the little worm
will be supplied with a superabundance of food; at least, it appears so from the fact, that
a few times I have found a quantity remaining in the cell after the queen had left. The consistence
of this food is about like cream, the color some lighter, or just tinged with yellow. If it
was thin like water, or even honey, I cannot imagine how it could be made to stay in the upper
end of an inverted cell of that size in such quantities as are put in, as the bees often fill
it near half full. Sometimes a cell of this kind will contain this food, and no worm to feed
upon it. I guessed the bees had compounded more than their present necessities required, and
that they stored it there to have it ready, also, that being there all might know it was for
royalty.

The taste is said to be "more pungent" than food given to the worker, and the difference in
food changes the bee from a worker to a queen. I have nothing to say against this hypothesis;
it may be so, or the young bee being obliged to stand on its head may effect it, or both causes
combined may effect the change. I never tasted this food, or found any test to apply.

The preceding plate represents a piece of comb containing all the different cells--those at
the left hand the size for drones. In the centre are few that appear sealed over, others nearly
covered, others the larva in different stages of growth, as well as the eggs. Fig. 1 represents
a queen's cell just commenced. They are usually started thus far the first season, very frequently
when the hive is only half or two-thirds full. Fig. 2 is a cell sufficiently advanced to receive
the egg. Fig. 3 one finished, the stage when the first swarm leaves. Fig. 4 when a queen has
been perfected and left. Fig. 5 is a cell where its occupant has been destroyed by a rival,
and removed by the workers. It will be perceived that each finished queen's cell contains as
much wax as fifty made for the workers.

LIABILITY OF BEING DESTROYED.

In any stage from the egg to maturity these royal insects are liable to be destroyed;--if honey
fails from any cause sufficient to make the existence of a swarm any way hazardous, the preparations
are abandoned, and these young queens destroyed; (I would here request the reader not to condemn
me for telling more than I can prove, until he has had the whole story; in the swarming season,
I will give further particulars.)

DRONES DESTROYED WHEN HONEY IS SCARCE.

When an occurrence like the above happens, the drones next fall victims to the failure of honey.
A brief existence only is theirs; such as are perfect, are destroyed without mercy; those in
the chrysalis state are often dragged out, and sacrificed to the necessities of the family.
Such as are allowed to hatch, instead of being fed and protected as they would be if honey
was abundant, are allowed, while yet weak from the effects of hunger, to wander from the hive,
and fall to the earth by hundreds. These effects attend only a scarcity in the early part of
the season. The massacre of July and September is quite different. The drones then have age
and strength--an effort is apparently first made by the workers to drive them out without proceeding
to extremes; they are harassed sometimes for several days; the workers feigning only to sting,
or else they cannot, as I never succeeded in seeing but very few dispatched in that way; yet
there is evidence proving beyond doubt that the sting is used. Hundreds will often be collected
together in a compact body at the bottom of the hive; this mutual protection affording a few
hours' respite from their tormentors, who do not cease to worry them. In a few days they are
gone, and it is a hard matter to tell what has become of them, at least the majority. If the
hive in September is well supplied with honey, a portion of the drones have a longer lease
of life given them; I have seen them as late as December. In some seasons, when the best hives
are poorly supplied with stores, the ensuing spring the bees will rear no drones, until the
flowers yield a good supply. I have known one or two years in which no drones appeared before
the last of June; at other times, thousands are matured by the first of May.

OLD QUEEN LEAVES WITH THE FIRST SWARM.

The old queen leaves with the first swarm; as soon as cells are ready in the new hive she will
deposit her eggs in them, at first for workers; the number perfected will correspond with the
supply of honey and size of the swarm. When the supply fails before leaving the old stock,
she remains there, and continues laying throughout the season; but the bees matured after the
20th of July (in this section) are not more than sufficient to keep the number good. As many
die, or are lost during their excursions, as the young ones will replace; in fact, they often
lose rather than gain; so that by the next spring, a hive that has cast no swarm, is no better
for a stock than one from which a swarm has issued. We are apt to be deceived by bees clustering
outside, towards the latter end of the season, and suppose it hardly possible for them all
to get in, when it may be caused by hot weather, full stores, &c.

A YOUNG QUEEN TAKES THE PLACE OF HER MOTHER IN THE OLD STOCK.

In ordinary circumstances, when a swarm has left a stock, the oldest of the young queens is
ready to emerge from her cell in about eight or nine days; if no second swarm is sent out,
she will take her mother's place, and begin to lay eggs in about ten days, or a little less.
Two or three weeks is the only time throughout the whole season, but what eggs can be found
in all prosperous hives. Whenever a copious yield of honey occurs, drones are reared; as it
becomes scarce, they are destroyed.

The relative number of drones and workers that exist when they are most numerous, doubtless
depends on the size of the hive, whether one in ten, or one in thirty.

When a swarm is first hived, the first cells are the size for working; if the hive be very
small, and bees numerous, it may be filled before they are fully aware of it, and but few drone-cells
constructed; consequently, but few can be raised; whereas if the hive be large, long before
it is full, considerable honey will be stored. Cells for storing honey are usually the size
for drones; these will be made as soon as the requisite number for workers is provided. An
abundant yield of honey during the process of filling a large hive, would therefore cause a
great proportion of these cells to be built--the amount of drone-brood being governed by the
same cause, is a strong argument against large hives, as affording room for too many of these
cells, where an unnecessary number of drones will be reared, causing a useless expenditure
of honey, &c.

OTHER THEORIES.

Theories differing materially from the foregoing, are advanced by nearly all writers. One says,
"In spring the queen lays about 2,000 eggs of males, resumes it again in August, but during
the rest of the intervals she exclusively lays worker eggs. The queen must be at least eleven
months old before she begins to lay the eggs of males." Mr. Townley makes the same assertion.
Dr. Bevan says, "the great laying of drone eggs usually commences about the end of April."
Another author repeats about the same, and appears to have investigated farther, as he has
found out that the eggs for the two kinds of bees are germinated separately, and the queen
knows when each kind is ready, as well as the workers, &c. Now, I beg leave to differ a little
from these authors. Either there exists no difference in the eggs germinated, and any, or all
will produce drones or workers, just as they happen to be deposited and fed; or else the periods
of laying drone eggs are much more frequent than any writer with which I am acquainted has
been willing to allow.

SUBJECT NOT UNDERSTOOD.

I am not anxious to establish a new theory, but to get at facts. If we pretend to understand
natural history, it is important that we have it correct; and if we do not understand it, say
so, and leave it open for further investigation. It is my opinion that we know but very little
about this point. I wish to induce closer observation, and would recommend no positive decision,
until all the facts that will apply have been examined. Whether these drone-egg theories have
been too hastily adopted, the reader can decide; I shall offer a few more facts, somewhat difficult
to reconcile with them.

First, in relation to the queen being "eleven months old" before laying drone eggs. We all
agree, I believe, that the old queen goes with the first swarm, and a young one remains in
the old stock. Now suppose the first swarm leaves in June, and the old stock yet contains a
numerous family. The flowers of buckwheat in August yield a bountiful harvest of honey. This
old stock rears a large brood of drones. Is it not proved in this case that the queen was but
two months old, instead of eleven? We further agree that young queens accompany second or after-swarms.
When these happen to be large and prosperous, they never fail to rear a brood of drones at
this season. What is the age of these? I apprehend that this eleven months theory originated
in sections where there are no crops of buckwheat raised, or in small quantities. Clover generally
fails in August, and May, or June, of another year comes round, before there is a sufficient
yield to produce the brood. With these observations only, how very rational to conclude that
it must be a law of their nature, instead of being governed by the yield of honey, and size
of the family? If the periods of drone egg laying are limited to only two or three, it would
seem that all queens ought to be ready with this kind of egg, about the same period of the
season, but how are the facts?

I would like to inquire what becomes of the first series of drone eggs, the last of April,
or the first of May, when the stocks are poorly supplied with honey, or when a family is small
and but little honey through the summer? No drone brood is matured in these cases. It is not
pretended that the queen has any control over the germination of these eggs, yet somehow she
has them ready whenever the situation of the hive will warrant it. Two stocks may have an equal
number of bees the first of May; one may have forty pounds of honey, the other four pounds;
the latter cannot afford to rear a drone, while the other will have hundreds. Let two stocks
have but four pounds each at any time in summer when honey is scarce, now feed one of them
plentifully, and a brood of drones is sure to appear, while the other will not produce one.
Whenever stocks are well stored with honey, and full of bees, the first of May will find drone-cells
containing brood. If the flowers continue to yield a full supply, these cells may be examined
every week from that period till the first swarm leaves, and I will engage that drone brood
may be found in all stages from the egg to maturity; and the worker brood the same. In twenty-four
days after the first swarm leaves, the last drone eggs left by the old queen will be just about
matured. When transferring bees from old to new hives, I generally do it about twenty-one or
twenty-two days after the first swarm, (this is the time to avoid destroying the worker-brood;
the particulars will be given in another place.) I have transferred a great many, and never
failed to find a few drones about ready to leave the combs. Whether the swarm had left the
last of May, or middle of July, there was no difference, they were on hand.

A very early swarm in good seasons, will often fill the hive, and send out an issue in from
four to six weeks: the usual amount of drone-brood may be found in these cases. The following
circumstance would appear to indicate that all the eggs are alike, and if they are laid in
drone-cells, the bees give the proper food and make drones; if in worker-cells, workers, just
as they make a queen from a worker-egg, when put in a royal cell.

In a glass hive, one sheet of comb next the glass, and parallel with it, was full size; about
three-quarters of this sheet was worker-cells, the remainder drone-cells. The family had been
rather small, but now had increased to a full swarm; a few drones had matured in the middle
of the hive. It was about the middle of June, 1850, when I discovered the bees on this outside
sheet, preparing it, as I thought, for brood, by cutting off the cells to the proper length.
They had been used for storing honey, and were much too long, being about an inch and a half
deep. In a day or two after I saw a few eggs in both worker and drone-cells; four or five days
afterwards, on opening the door, I found her "majesty" engaged in depositing eggs in the drone
cells. Nearly every one already contained an egg; most of these she examined, but did not use
them; six or eight, it appeared, were all that were unoccupied; in each of these she immediately
deposited an egg. She continued to search for more empty cells, and in doing so, she got on
the part of the comb containing worker-cells, where she found a dozen or more empty, in each
of which, she laid one. The whole time perhaps thirty minutes. Query? Was her series of drone
eggs exhausted just at this time? If so, it would appear that she was not aware of it, because
she examined several drone-cells after laying the last one there, before leaving that part
of the comb, and acted exactly as if she would have used them had they not been pre-occupied.
Did the worker-cells receive some eggs that would have produced drones, but for the circumstance
of being deposited in worker-cells? I know we are told that an egg may be transferred from
a worker-cell to one for drones, or an egg taken from a drone-cell and deposited in a worker-cell;
that the exchange will make no difference, the bee will be just what the first deposit would
have made it. How the knowledge for this assertion was obtained, we are not informed, at least
of the practical part. That an egg was ever detached from the bottom of one cell safely and
successfully deposited in another, without breaking or injuring it in some manner, to make
the bees refuse it, permit me at present to doubt.

NECESSITY FOR FURTHER OBSERVATION.

Cannot some experiments, practicable to all, be instituted that will throw more light on this
subject? The old hypothesis of limiting drone-egg laying to two or three periods, is evidently
at fault.

TWO SIDES OF THE QUESTION.

If we suppose that the eggs are all alike, and the subsequent treatment makes either workers,
drones, or queens, and look to analogy for support, we shall find much against, as well as
for it. For instance, we find in almost every department of animated nature, that the sex of
the germ of a future being is decided before being separated from the parent, as the eggs of
fowls, &c. Another fact, some queens (averaging one in sixty or eighty) deposit eggs that produce
only drones,[8] whether in worker or drone-cells, proving that sex is decided in this case
beyond controversy. Hence it would appear reasonable, if sex was decided by the ovaries of
the queen, in one case, it would be in another.

      [8] I have had several such. It made no difference whether the
      eggs were in the worker-cells or drone-cells, the brood was all
      drones. When in the worker-cells, (and the majority was there,)
      they required to be lengthened about one-third. In an occurrence
      of this kind, the colony of workers will rapidly diminish in
      number, until too few are left to protect the combs from the
      moth. It occurs most frequently in spring, but I once had a case
      the last of summer. The first indications are an unusual number
      of caps, or covers of cells, being under and about the hive; the
      workers, instead of increasing, grow less in number. When you
      fear this state of things, make a thorough examination, blow
      under the hive some tobacco smoke, as directed in pruning, invert
      the hive, part the combs till you can see the brood; if the
      worker-cells contain drones, they are readily perceived, as they
      project beyond the usual even surface, being very irregular, here
      and there a few, or perhaps but one sticking out. The  worker-brood,
      when in their own cells, form nearly an even surface; so of the
      drones. The only remedy that I have found is to destroy this
      queen, and substitute another, which can be obtained in the
      swarming season, or in the fall, better than at other times. To
      find the queen, paralyze with puff-ball, &c. For directions see
      fall management.

To allow the bees the power of making three kinds of bees from one kind of eggs, which would
be virtually constituting a third sex, an anomaly not often found. The drones being males,
and workers imperfect females with generative organs undeveloped, renders the anomaly of the
third sex unnecessary. On the other side it might be said in reply: That if food and treatment
would create or produce organs of generation in the female, by making an egg destined for a
worker into a queen, (a fact which all apiarians admit,) why not food and treatment make the
drone? Is the difficulty of developing one kind of sexual organs greater than another?

Respecting the anomaly of the eggs of some queens producing only drones, the question might
be asked, Is this more of an anomaly than that of ordinary queens which are said to germinate
eggs in distinct series? It is all out of the usual line. Other animals or insects usually
produce the sexes promiscuously. As we are ignorant of causes deciding sex in any case, we
must acknowledge mystery to belong to both sides of the question here. The stumbling-block
of more than two sexes, which seems so necessary to make plain, is no greater here than with
some species of ants, that have, as we are told, king, queen, soldier and laborer. Four distinct
and differently formed bodies, all belonging to one nest, and descended from one mother. Whether
there are four distinct kinds of eggs producing them, or the power is given to the workers
to develop such as are wanted, from one kind, we cannot say. If we make two kinds of eggs,
it helps the matter but very little. There is still an anomaly. There is but one perfect female
in a nest to germinate eggs, and the myriads produced (being over 80,000 in twenty-four hours,
according to some historians) shows that the fecundity of our queen-bee is not a parallel case
by any means. And yet they are similar, by having their offspring provided for without an effort
of their own.

I shall leave this matter for the present, hoping that something conclusive may occur in the
course of my experiments, or those of others. At present I am inclined to think that the eggs
are all alike, but am not fully satisfied.

I am aware that this matter is of but little value or interest to many, but myself and a few
others have "Yankee inquisitiveness" pretty well developed, and would like to know how it was
managed.

As for workers proving occasionally fertile, I have but little to say. After years of close
observation directed to this point, I have been unable to discover anything to establish this
opinion. Neither have I found the black bees described by some authors. It is true that in
the middle or latter part of summer a portion will be much darker than others, and perhaps
rather smaller, and some of them with their wings somewhat worn, probably the result of continued
labor, peculiar food, or some incidental circumstance.

I have a few times found a humble-bee under the hive, that had entered, and not finding his
way out readily, was speedily shorn of his beautiful "locks," and consequently his strength--that
is, every particle of hair, down, feathers, bristles, or whatever he had been covered with,
was completely removed by the bees, who had no regard for his beautiful alternating stripes
of yellow and brown; which left him the very picture of darkness.

CHAPTER IV.

BEE PASTURAGE.

In some seasons the earth is covered with snow much later than others. When this occurs, a
greater number of warm days are necessary to melt it, and start the flowers, than otherwise.

SUBSTITUTE FOR POLLEN.

During these warm days, while waiting for the flowers, the bees are anxious to do something.
It is then interesting to watch them, and see what will be used as substitutes for pollen and
honey. At such times, I have seen hundreds engaged on a heap of sawdust, gathering the minute
particles into little pellets on their legs, seeming quite pleased with the acquisition. Rotten
wood, when crumbled into powder, and dry, is also collected. Flour, when scattered near the
hive, I have known to be taken up in considerable quantities. Some apiarians have fed it to
their bees at this season, and consider it a great advantage; I have not tested it sufficient
to give an opinion. A substitute for honey is sap from a few kinds of trees, yet it all amounts
to but very little. All these unnatural sources are abandoned when the flowers appear.

MANNER OF PACKING IT.

The particular manner of obtaining pollen has been witnessed by but very few persons, as it
is generally brushed from their bodies and packed on their legs, while on the wing, thereby
preventing a fair chance to inspect operations. When collecting only pollen they alight on
the flowers, passing rapidly over the stamens, detaching a portion of the dust, which lodges
on most parts of them, to be brushed together and packed into pellets when again on the wing.
Thus they keep alternately flying and alighting until a load is obtained, when they immediately
return to the hive; each bee bringing several loads in a day. Honey, as it is collected, is
deposited in the abdomen, and kept out of sight till stored in the hive.

ALDER YIELDS THE FIRST.

The first material gathered from flowers is pollen. Candle-alder (Alnus Rubra)[9] yields the
first supply. The time of flowering varies from the 10th of March to the 20th of April. The
amount afforded is also variable. Cold, freezing weather frequently destroys a great portion
of these flowers after they are out. These staminate flowers are nearly perfected the season
previous, and a few warm days in spring will bring them out, even before any leaves appear.
When the weather continues fine, great quantities of farina are secured.

      [9] The botanical names are from Wood's Class-Book.

The time that bees commence their labors does not govern the time of swarming by any means;
this matter depends on the weather through April and May. These remarks apply particularly
to this section, Green County, New York, in latitude about 42 degrees. In other places many
different trees, shrubs, and herbs, may be found yielding honey and pollen that scarcely exist
here, producing far different results.

Our swamps produce several varieties of willow, (salix,) that put out their blossoms very irregularly.
Some of these bushes are a month earlier than others, and some of the buds on the same bush
are a week or two later than the rest. These also afford only pollen, but are much more dependence
than alder, as a turn of cold weather cannot at any time destroy more than a small part. Next
comes the aspen, (Populus Tremuloides); of this we have more than is necessary for any purpose.
It is not a particular favorite with the bees, as but few, comparatively, visit it. It is followed
very soon by an abundance of the red maple (Acer Rubrum), that suits them better, but this,
like the others, is often lost by freezing. The first honey obtained of any account is from
the golden willow (Salix Vitellina); it yields no pollen, and is seldom injured by frost. Gooseberries,
currants, cherries, pear and peach trees, add a share of both honey and pollen. Sugar maple
(Acer Saccharinum) now throws out its ten thousand silken tassels, beautiful as gold. Strawberries
modestly open their petals in invitation, but, like "obscure virtues," are often neglected
for the more conspicuous Dandelion, and the showy appearance and flagrant blossoms of the apple-trees,
which now open their stores, offering to their acceptance a real harvest.

 The time of sowing the grain varies in different sections, from
the 10th of June to the 20th July. Farmers wish to give it just time to ripen before frost,
as the yield of grain is considered better, but as the time of frost is a matter of guess-work,
some will sow several days earlier than others. Whenever an abundant crop of this grain is
realized, a proportionate quantity of honey is obtained.

DO BEES INJURE THE CROP?

Many people contend that bees are an injury to this crop, by taking away the substance that
would be formed into grain. The best reasons for this opinion that I have obtained are these:
"I believe it, and have thought so a long time." "It is reasonable if a portion of this plant
is taken away by the bees, there must be a less quantity of material left for the formation
of seed, &c." Most of us have learned that a person's opinion is not the strongest kind of
proof, unless he can exhibit substantial reasons for it. Are the above reasons satisfactory?
How are the facts? The flowers expand, and a set of vessels pour into the cup or nectary a
minute portion of honey. I am not aware that any one contends that the plant has another set
of vessels prepared to again absorb this honey and convert it into grain. But strong testimony
proves very plainly that it never again enters the stalk or flower, but evaporates like water.
We all know that animal matter when putrid will be dissolved into particles small enough to
float in the atmosphere, too minute for the naked eye. When passing off in this way this real
flesh and blood would escape notice perhaps altogether, and never be detected, were it not
for the olfactories, which on some occasions notify us of its presence very forcibly. In passing
a field of buckwheat in bloom, by the same means we are assured of the presence of honey in
the air. Now what is the difference whether this honey passes off in the air, or is collected
by the bees? If any difference, the advantage appears to be in favor of the bees getting it,
for the reason that it thus answers another important end in the economy of nature, consistent
with her provisions in ten thousand different ways of adapting means to ends. Most breeders
of domestic animals are aware of the deteriorating qualities induced by in-and-in breeding;
a change of breed is found necessary for perfection, &c.

ARE NOT BEES AN ADVANTAGE TO VEGETATION?

Vegetable physiology seems to indicate a similar necessity in that department. The stamens
and pistils of flowers answer the different organs of the two sexes in animals. The pistil
is connected with the ovaries, the stamens furnish the pollen that must come in contact with
the pistil; in other words, it must be impregnated by this dust from the stamens, or no fruit
will be produced. Now if it be necessary to change the breed, or essential that the pollen
produced by the stamens of one flower shall fertilize the pistil of another, to prevent barrenness,
what should we contrive better than the arrangement already made by Him who knew the necessity
and planned it accordingly? And it works so admirably, that we can hardly avoid the conclusion
that bees were intended for this important purpose! It is thus planned! Their wants and their
food shall consist of honey and pollen; each flower secretes but little, just enough to attract
the bee; nothing like a full load is obtained from one; were it thus, the end in view would
not be answered; but a hundred or more flowers are often visited in one excursion; the pollen
obtained from the first may fertilize many, previous to the bees' returning to the hive; thus
a field of buckwheat may be kept in health and vigor in its future productions. A field of
wheat produces long slender stalks that yield to the influence of the breeze, and one ear is
made to bestow its pollen on a neighboring ear several feet distant, thereby effecting just
what bees do for buckwheat. Corn, from its manner of growth, the upright stalk bearing the
stamens some feet above the pistils, on the ears below, seems to need no agency of bees; the
superabundant pollen from the tassel is wafted by the winds rods from the producing stalk,
and there does its office of fertilizing a distant ear, as is proved by different varieties
mixing at some distance. But how is it with our vines trailing on the earth, a part of these
flowers producing stamens, the other only pistils? Now it is absolutely essential that pollen
from the staminate flowers shall be introduced into the pistillate to produce fruit; because
if a failure occurs in this matter the germ will wither and die. Here we have the agent ready
for our purpose; these flowers are visited by the bee promiscuously; no pollen (as was said)
is kneaded into pellets, (particularly that from pumpkins,) but it adheres to every part of
their body, rendering it next to impossible for a bee thus covered with dust to enter the pistillated
flower without fulfilling the important duty designed, and leave a portion of the fertilizing
dust in its proper place. Hence it is reasonably inferred by many, that if it was not for this
agent among our vines, the uncertainty of a crop from non-fertilization would render the cultivation
of them a useless task.

When the aphis is located on the stalk or leaf of a plant it is furnished with means to pierce
the surface and extract the juices essential to the formation of the plant, thereby preventing
vigorous growth and a full development. This idea is too apt to be associated with the bee
when she visits the flower, as if she was armed with a spear, to pierce bark or stem and rob
it of its nourishment. Her real structure is lost sight of, or perhaps never known; her slender
brush-like tongue folded closely under her neck, and seldom seen except when in use, is not
fitted to pierce the most delicate substance; all that it can be used for is to sweep or lick
up the nectar as it exudes from the pores of the flower, secreted, it would seem, for no other
purpose but to attract her--while there she obtains nothing but what nature has provided for
her and given her the means of obtaining, and the most delicate petal receives no injury.

During an excursion the bee seldom visits more than a single species of flower; were it otherwise,
and all kinds of flowers were visited promiscuously, by fertilizing one species with the pollen
from another, the vegetable kingdom would be very likely to get into confusion. Writers, when
noticing the peculiarity of instinct governing the bee here, cannot be content always, but
must add other marvels. They follow this trait into the hive, and make her store every kind
by itself there. Relative to honey it is not an easy matter to be positive; but pollen is of
a variety of colors, generally yellow, yet sometimes pale-green, and reddish or dark-brown.
Now I think a little patient inspection would have satisfied any one that two kinds are sometimes
packed in one cell, and prevented the assertion to the contrary. I will admit that two colors
are seldom found packed together, but sometimes will be. I have thus found it, and it has entirely
ruined that theory for me.

A TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF QUEEN DOUBTED.

It is further asserted that if a hive loses its queen "no pollen is collected." Also, "that
such quantities are sometimes collected, and fill so many cells, that too little room is left
for brood, and the stock rapidly dwindles away in consequence." The first of these assertions
has been given as a test to decide whether the hive contains a queen or not. Now my bees have
such a habit of doing things wrong that the above is no test whatever. It is made to appear
very well in theory, but wants the truth in practice. I will say what I have known on this
point, and perhaps clear up the difficulty of a stock containing an unusual quantity of bee-bread
with the honey, and instead of being the cause of its having but few bees, it is the effect.
Stocks and sometimes swarms lose their queen in the swarming season, (the particulars will
be given in another place,) when, instead of remaining idle, the usual quantity of both pollen
and honey is collected (unless the family is very small). There being no larvæ to consume the
bread, the consequence is, more than half the breeding cells will contain it; they will be
packed about two-thirds full, and finished out with honey. I have known a large family left
under such circumstances, and about all the cells in the hive would be occupied. Whereas, in
a stock containing a queen and rearing brood, a portion of the combs will be used for this
purpose until the flowers fail, and then such comb will be found empty.

AN EXTRA QUANTITY OF POLLEN NOT ALWAYS DETRIMENTAL.

To test whether this extra quantity of bee-bread was so very detrimental, I have introduced
into such hive in the fall a family with a queen and wintered them in it, and watched their
prosperity another year, and never found them less profitable on that account. I am so well
satisfied of this, that whenever I now have a hive in such a situation, it is a rule to introduce
a swarm.

It is calculated, I believe, generally, that when medium-sized hives are full, about seven-eighths
of the cells are made the proper diameter for raising the workers, the remainder for drones,
except a few for queens. Here is one circumstance I do not remember to have seen mentioned,
and that is, bee-bread is generally packed exclusively in the worker cells. I would say always;
but I would do better to be careful, especially as I find my bees doing things so differently
from some others. I might as well remark here, that when taking combs from a hive filled with
honey, if such pieces were selected as contained only the large or drone cells, but little
risk of bee-bread would occur; of the other combs, the outside sheets and the corners of the
others near the top are the next best. The sheets of comb used principally for raising workers,
and the cells next those so used, for an inch or two in width, are nearly all packed with pollen,
and much of it will remain, when the breeding season is past. Smaller portions are found in
the worker cells in nearly all parts of the hive; even the boxes will sometimes contain a little.

MANNER OF PACKING STORES.

In a glass hive, the bees may be seen depositing their load of pollen; the legs holding the
pellets are thrust into the cell, (not their heads), and a motion like rubbing them together
is made for a half minute, when they are withdrawn, and the two little loaves of bread may
be seen at the bottom. This bee appears to take no farther care about them, but another will
soon come along, and enter the cell head first, and pack it close; this cell is filled about
two-thirds of its length in this way, and when sealed over a little honey is used to fill it out.

PHILOSOPHY IN FILLING A CELL WITH HONEY.

To witness the operation of depositing honey, a glass hive or box is requisite; the edges of
the combs will be attached to the glass--when honey is abundant, most of these cells next the
glass will contain some. Now is the time to see the operation, glass forming one side of such
as are in contact, &c. The bee may be seen to enter the cell till it reaches the bottom; with
its tongue, the first particle is deposited, and brushed into the corners or angles, carefully
excluding all the air from behind it--as it is filled, that next the sides of the cell is kept
in advance of the centre. The bee does not put its tongue in the centre and pour out its load
there, but carefully brushes the sides as it fills, excluding every particle of air, and keeps
the surface concave instead of convex. This is just as a philosopher would say it should be.
If it was filled at once and no care taken to attach it to the sides, why, the external air
would never keep it there, which it does effectually when of ordinary length. When the cell
is about one-fourth of an inch deep they often commence filling it, and as it is lengthened
they add to it, keeping it within an eighth of an inch of the end; it is never quite full till
nearly sealed over, and often not then. In cells of the worker size, the sealing seldom touches
the honey. But in the size for drones the case is different; the honey on the end touches the
sealing, about half the diameter on the lower side; it is kept in the same shape while being
filled; but being somewhat larger, the atmospheric pressure is less effectual in keeping the
honey in its place; consequently, when they commence sealing these cells they begin on the
lower side and finish at the top.

LONG CELLS SOMETIMES TURNED UPWARD.

When storing honey in boxes, cells of this size are usually much longer, in which case they
are crooked, the ends turning upward, sometimes half an inch or more; this, of course, will
prevent the honey from running, but if the box is taken off and turned over before such cells
are sealed, they are very sure to spill most of their contents. The cells in the breeding apartment,
of ordinary length, will hold the honey well enough as long as horizontal; but turn the hive
on its side, and bring the open end downward, in hot weather, or break out a piece and hold
it in that position, the air will not sustain it in them, but will, in the size suitable for
workers.

When the hive is fully supplied with bees and honey, (unless destitute of a queen,) I never
examined one, winter or summer, but it had a number of unsealed cells containing honey, as
well as pollen; it is so when they have stored fifty pounds in boxes, even when so crowded
for room as to store honey outside or under the bottom-board; ever having some cells open for
a ready supply.

Young swarms seem unwilling to construct combs faster than needed for use; it would appear,
at first thought, to be a lack of economy. When no honey is to be obtained and nothing to do,
then it would seem to be a fine chance for getting ready for a yield; but this is not their
way of doing business; whether they cannot spare the honey already collected to elaborate the
wax, or whether they find it more difficult to keep the worms from a large quantity of comb,
I shall not decide. Of this I am satisfied, that it is better arranged by their instincts,
than we could do it. Large swarms, when first located, if honey is abundant, will extend their
combs from top to bottom in a little more than two weeks; but such hive is not yet full; some
sheets of comb may contain honey throughout their whole length, and not a cell be sealed over;
but, however, they generally find time to finish up within a few inches of the lower end as
they proceed. Whenever unfinished cells contain honey, it will generally be removed soon after
the flowers fail, and used before that which is sealed; and the cells will remain empty till
another year.

IS A DRY OR WET SEASON BEST FOR HONEY?

The inquiry is often made, "What kind of season is best for bees, wet or dry?" This point I
have watched very closely, and have found that a medium between the two extremes produces most
honey. When farmers begin to express fears of a drought, then is the time (if in the season
of flowers) that most honey is obtained; but if dry weather passes these limits, the quantity
is greatly diminished. Of the two extremes, perhaps very wet is the worst.

HOW MANY STOCKS SHOULD BE KEPT.

"What number of stocks can there be kept in one place?" is another question often asked. This
is like Mr. A. asking farmer B. how many cattle could be pastured in a lot of ten acres. Farmer
B. would first wish to know how much pasture said lot would produce, before he could begin
to answer; since one lot of that size might produce ten times as much as the other. So with
bees, one apiary of two hundred stocks might find honey in abundance for all, and another of
forty might almost starve. Like the cattle, it depends on pasture.

THREE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF HONEY.

There are three principal sources of honey, viz.:--clover, basswood, and buckwheat. But clover
is the only universal dependance; as that is almost everywhere, to some extent, in the country.
Buckwheat in some places is the main source; in others, basswood, which is of brief duration.
Where all three are abundant, there is the true El Dorado of the apiarian! With plenty of clover
and buckwheat, it is nearly as well. Even with clover alone, enormous quantities of honey are
obtained. I have said what was our dependence in this section. I will further say that within
a circle of three or four miles, there are kept about three hundred stocks. I have had for
several years, three apiaries about two miles apart, averaging in spring a little more than
fifty in each. When a good season for clover occurs, as many more would probably do equally
well, but in some other seasons I have had too many; on an average nearly right. When clover
furnishes too little honey for the number, buckwheat usually supplies more than is collected.
Of surplus honey, the proportion is about fifteen pounds of buckwheat to one of clover. I have
now been speaking of large apiaries. There can hardly be a section of country found, that man
can procure his living, but what a few stocks would thrive, even if there were no dependence
on the sources just mentioned. There will be some honey-yielding flowers in nearly all places.
The evil of over-stocking is of short duration, and will work its own cure speedily. Some judgment
is required here as well as in other matters.

Another question of some interest, is the distance that a bee will travel in search of honey
in flowers--it is evident that it will be farther than they will go to plunder a stock. I have
heard of their being found seven miles from home. It was said they ascertained, by sprinkling
flour on them as they left the hive in the morning, and then saw the same bees that distance
away. When we consider the chances of finding a bee even one mile from the hive thus marked,
it appears like a "poor look;" and then pollen the color of flour might deceive us. It is difficult
to prove that bees go even two miles. Let us say we guess at it, for the present.

CHAPTER V.

WAX.

The careless, unreflecting observer, when seeing the bees enter the hive with a pellet of pollen
on each of their posterior legs, is very apt to conclude that it must be material for comb,
as it appears unlike honey. So little regard is paid to the matter by many people, that they
are unable to imagine any other use for it. Others suppose that it will change from that to
honey, after being stored a time in the hive, and wonder at the curious phenomenon; but when
asked how long a time must elapse before it takes place, they cannot tell exactly, but they
"have found cells where it began to change, as a portion near the outer end of the cell had
become honey, and no doubt the remainder would in time." It has been remarked that cells were
only filled about two-thirds full of this, and finished with honey; now when any one finds
a cell filled to the brim with pollen, and no honey, such reasoning will apply better. If this
was the case, by examining at different periods through the summer, we certainly should find
some cells before the change had commenced, instead of their always being in just this stage
of transition.

IS POLLEN CONVERTED INTO WAX?

As for pollen being converted into wax or comb, a simple question will show its fallacy. Do
not the bees belonging to a hive that is full of combs, and no more wax for that purpose needed,
bring home as much and often more pollen than one half full? Any person who has watched two
such hives five minutes when busily engaged at work, can answer. It is evident, then, that
pollen is for something else besides wax.

HOW IS IT OBTAINED?

The inquiry is now made, "Where do they get it from, if not from pollen?" I might with propriety
answer, they don't get it at all. "Stop, there, if you please; if you expect us to credit you,
you must not give us too much absurdity." Well, let me ask a question. Do cattle when grazing
actually obtain flesh, bone, &c., or only the materials from which these parts are secreted?
As to the production of wax, I believe all close observers (that I have found) agree that it
is a secretion natural only to the bee. With the ox, fruit, grain, or grass may be converted
into tallow; with the bee, honey and syrup made of sugar may be converted into wax. These are
probably the only two substances yet discovered from which they extract it. Some writers have
pretended that pollen is also used, but they have failed to prove that the old bees consume
it at any time; which they must in this case if it is converted into wax. From experiments
related by Huber, either of these substances, mixed with a little water, is all sufficient
for its production. From experiments of my own, I am satisfied that he is correct. The experiment
is tried by shutting up a swarm when first hived; feeding them with honey--a few of the bees
will probably have some pollen, though not enough to make a comb three inches square, yet it
is something--and to be certain, time must be given them to exhaust it. In three or four days
take out the bees and remove the combs; inclose them again, and feed with honey as before.
Repeat the process, until satisfied that no pollen is needed in the composition of wax. Huber
removed the combs "five times," with the same result at every trial. Whenever bees are confined
in hot weather, air and water are absolutely necessary.

We will now describe the first appearance of wax, and how it is produced. When a swarm of bees
is about leaving the parent stock, three-fourths or more of them will fill their sacks with
honey. When located in their new home, of course no cells exist to hold it; it must remain
in the stomach or sack for several hours. The consequence is, that thin white scales of wax
the sixteenth of an inch in diameter, somewhat circular, are formed between the rings of the
abdomen, under side. With the claws of one of their hind legs one of these is detached and
conveyed to the mouth, and there pinched with their forceps or teeth, until one edge is worked
somewhat rough; it is then applied to the comb being constructed, or to the roof of the hive.
The first rudiments of comb are often applied within the first half hour after the swarm is
hived. In the history of insects before noticed, is a minute account of the first foundation
of combs, somewhat amusing, if not instructive.

HUBER'S ACCOUNT OF A COMMENCEMENT OF COMB.

Huber, it is said, "having provided a hive with honey and water, it was resorted to in crowds
by bees, who, having satisfied their appetite, returned to the hive. They formed festoons,
remained motionless for twenty-four hours, and after a time scales of wax appeared. An adequate
supply of wax for the construction of a comb having been elaborated, one of them disengaged
itself from the centre of the group, and clearing a space about an inch in diameter, at the
top of the hive, applied the pincers of one of its legs to its side, detached a scale of wax,
and immediately began to mince it with the tongue. During the operation, this organ was made
to assume every variety of shape; sometimes it appeared like a trowel, then flattened like
a spatula, and at other times like a pencil, ending in a point. The scale, moistened with a
frothy liquid, became glutinous, and was drawn out like a riband. This bee then attached all
the wax it could concoct to the vault of the hive, and went its way. A second now succeeded,
and did the like; a third followed, but owing to some blunder did not put the wax in the same
line with its predecessor; upon which another bee, apparently sensible of the defect, removed
the displaced wax, and carrying it to the former heap, deposited it there, exactly in the order
and direction pointed out." Now I have some objections to make to this account. First, in the
usual course of swarming, it is unnecessary to provide the honey and water, as they come laden
with honey from the parent stock. Next, to form festoons and remain motionless twenty-four
hours to concoct the wax, is not the way they generally manage affairs. They either swallow
the honey before leaving home long enough to have the wax ready, or less time than twenty-four
hours is needed to produce it. I have frequently found lumps, half the size of a pin's head,
attached to the branch of a tree where they had clustered, when they had not been there over
twenty-five minutes. I have had occasion a few times to change the swarm to another tenement,
an hour or two after being hived, and found places on the top nearly covered with wax. How
it was managed to see a bee quit the "group," is more than I can comprehend; and then the tongue
to be the only instrument used to mould the scale of wax, is another difficulty; to witness
the whole process minutely in this stage of comb-making has never been my good fortune, and
I am sometimes inclined to doubt the success of others. I have had glass hives, and put swarms
in them, and always found the first rudiments of comb so entirely covered with bees as to prevent
my seeing anything.

BEST TIME TO WITNESS COMB-MAKING.

The only time when I have witnessed the process with any degree of satisfaction is when the
combs approach the glass, and but few bees in the way; then, by watching patiently a few minutes,
some part of the process may be seen.

MANNER OF WORKING WAX.

Transferring the swarms to different hives from one to forty-eight hours after being hived,
will show their progress. I have found that wax is attached to the top of the hive at first
promiscuously, that is, without the least order, until some of the blocks or lumps are sufficiently
advanced for them to begin cells. The scales of wax are welded on the edge quite thick, without
regard to the shape of the cell, then an excavation is made on one side for the bottom of a
cell, and two others on the opposite side; the division between them exactly opposite the centre
of the first. When this piece is an inch or two in length, two other pieces at equal distances
on each side are commenced. If the swarm is large, and honey abundant, it is common for two
pieces of comb to be started at one time on different parts of the top; the sheets in the two
places are often at right angles, or any other way, just as chance happens to give direction.
The little lumps that are placed at random at first are all removed as they advance.

While the combs are in progress, the edges are always kept much the thickest, and the base
of the cell is worked down to the proper thickness with their teeth, and polished smooth as
glass. The ends of the cell also, as they lengthen them, will always be found much thicker
than any other part of it when finished.

When two combs approach each other in the middle of the hive at nearly right angles, an edge
of comb is left there; but when an obtuse angle, the edges are generally joined, making a sheet
of crooked comb. It is evident where the two combs join, there must be some irregular cells
unfit for rearing brood.

CROOKED COMBS A DISADVANTAGE.

These few irregular cells have been considered a great disadvantage. It is thought, or pretended,
that there is a vast difference between the prosperity of a stock with straight combs and one
with crooked ones. To avoid them, or cause the bees to make them all straight, has given rise
to much contrivance, as if a few such cells could effect much. Suppose there were a dozen sheets
of comb in a hive, and each one had a row or more of such irregular cells from top to bottom,
what proportion would they hold to those that were perfect? Perhaps not one in a thousand.
Hence we infer that in a hive of the proper size, the difference in amount of brood never could
be perceived. This is the only difference it can make, because such cells can be used for storing
honey as well as others. But sometimes there will be corners and spaces not wide enough for
two combs, and too wide for one of the proper thickness for breeding. As bees use all their
room economically, and generally at the best advantage, a thick comb will be the result. It
is said they never use such thick combs for breeding. How are the facts? I have just such a
space in a glass hive; one comb two inches thick. How is it managed? Towards fall this sheet
is filled with honey; the cells outside are lengthened until there is just room for a bee to
pass between them and the glass, when they are sealed over. In spring these long cells are
all cut down (except at the top and upper corners) to the proper length for breeding, and used
for this purpose. This has been done for five years in succession.

I will grant that there is a little waste room in such spaces, for part of the year. It amounts
to but little, as it is only outside. They are necessitated to make such combs, because the
inside combs, if built in a breeding apartment, however crooked one may be, the next one will
generally match it, the right distance from it. But when they are built expressly for storing
honey, in such as are made in boxes, the right distance is not so well preserved; hence it
is not recommended to compel bees to use such storing apartment for breeding. But suppose we
should compel a swarm to labor under these disadvantages, I should not apprehend such disastrous
results, (providing they have a proper proportion of worker cells,) as no swarms, or even no
surplus honey, as has been represented. Imagine a hive filled with combs that are all too thick,
and room wasted when cut down, to the amount of one-fourth of all that is in the hive. Now
here are combs enough left to mature three-fourths as many bees as in an ordinary hive, where
all are right. We can now suppose a good swarm will bring home the same amount of honey as
though it belonged to other hives; only three-fourths as much can be fed to the brood, and
stored in the hive; and the result ought to be, that we get a quarter more surplus honey in
boxes. Even if we get no swarm, I cannot see how our surplus honey can be less, as in this
case there would be more bees at all times than in a hive that had been reduced by swarming.

Does experience substantiate the theory that stocks with crooked combs are as profitable as
when they are straight? When combs are built expressly for breeding, I could never discover
any difference. Any person can easily test it by a little observation; not by taking a solitary
instance of only one hive, because some other cause might produce the result. Take a half-dozen
at least with straight combs, and as many with them crooked; have them all alike in other respects,
and carefully watch the result. I think you will have but little interest which way the combs
are made, providing they are made, as far as profit is concerned. It is true, it would gratify
order to have them all straight, and if it was not attended with more trouble than the result
would pay for, it would be well to have them so.

In ordinary circumstances, when a swarm is first hived, they set about comb-making immediately;
yet sometimes they will remain two days, and not make a particle. I have known them to swarm
out and cluster in the usual way, and when rehived, commence at once. This seems to prove that
they can retain the wax, or prevent secreting it, till wanted. This seldom occurs.

UNCERTAINTY IN WEIGHT OF BEES.

A large swarm will probably carry with them some five or six pounds of honey from the parent
stock. I only guess at this, because I am uncertain what the bees weigh exactly. "I can tell
you," some one exclaims, "I saw some weighed,--so many weigh just eight ounces." Are you sure
there was nothing but bees weighed? Was there no honey, bee-bread, fæces, or other substance,
that might deceive you? "Can't say; I never thought of that!" Now it is important, if we weigh
bees to know their weight, to be sure we weigh nothing else. It is evident, that if five thousand
weigh three pounds, when nothing is in their sacks, they would weigh, when filled with honey,
several pounds more. Hence, the fallacy of judging of the size of a swarm by weight, as one
swarm might issue with half the honey of another. Perhaps eight pounds, for large swarms, might
be an average for bees and honey. This honey, whatever it amounts to, cannot be stored till
combs are constructed to hold it. This principle holds good till the hive is full. That is,
whenever they have more honey than the combs will hold, if there is room in the hive, they
construct more. But they seem to go no farther than this in comb-making. However large the
swarm may be, this compulsion appears necessary to fill the hive. Drone-cells are seldom made
in the top of the hive, but a part are generally joined on the worker-cells, a little distance
from the top; others near the bottom. There seems to be no rule about the number of such cells.
Some hives will contain twice the number of others. It may depend on the yield of honey at
the time; when very plenty, more drone-cells, &c. If the hive be very large, no doubt an unprofitable
number would be constructed. Where the large and small cells join, there will be some cells
of irregular shape; some with four or five angles; the distance from one angle to the other
is also varied. Even where two combs of cells the same size join, making a straight comb, they
are not always perfect.

SOME WAX WASTED.

When constructing comb, they are constantly wasting wax, either accidentally or voluntarily.
The next morning after a swarm is located, the scales may be found, and will continue to increase
as long as they are working it; the quantity often amounts to a handful or more. It is the
best test of comb-making that I can give. Clean off the board and look the next morning, you
will find the scales in proportion to their progress. Some will be nearly round as at first;
others more or less worked up, and a part will be like fine saw-dust.

Huber and some others have divided the working bees into different classes, denominating some
wax-workers, others nurses, and pollen gatherers, &c. It may be partially true, but how it
was found out is the mystery.

The angles in the cells used for brood, are gradually filled, and after a time become round,
both at the ends and sides.

WATER NECESSARY TO COMB-MAKING.

Whenever bees are engaged making comb, a supply of water is absolutely necessary. Some think
it requisite in rearing brood. It may be needed for that, or it may be required for both purposes;
but yet I have doubts if a particle is given to the young bee, besides what the honey contains.
June, and first part of July, and most part of August (the season of buckwheat,) are periods
of extensive comb-making; they then use most water; breeding is carried on from March till
October, and as extensively in May, perhaps more so, than in August, yet not a tenth part of
the water is used in May.

I have known stocks repeatedly to mature brood from the egg to the perfect bee, when shut in
a dark room for months, when it was impossible to obtain a drop; also stocks that stand in
the cold, (if good,) will mature some brood whether the bees can leave the hive or not. These
facts prove that some are reared without water. As they get sufficient honey to require more
comb to store it, they will at the same time have a brood; and it is easy to guess they need
it for brood as comb, without a little investigation. This much is certain, that they use water
at such times for some purpose, and when no pond, brook, spring, or other source is within
convenient distance, the apiarian would find it economy to place some within their reach, as
it would save much valuable time, if they would otherwise have to go a great distance, when
they might be more profitably employed; it always happens in a season of honey. It should be
so situated that the bees may obtain it without jeopardizing their lives;--a barrel or pail
has sides so steep that a great many will slip off and drown. A trough made very shallow, with
a good broad strip around the edge to afford an alighting place, should be provided. The middle
should contain a float, or a handful of shavings spread in the water with a few small stones
laid on them to prevent their being blown away when the water is out, is very convenient. A
tin dish an inch or so in depth, will do very well. The quantity needed may be ascertained
by what is used--only give them enough, and change it daily. I have no trouble of this kind,
as there is a stream of water within a few rods of the hives; but I have an opportunity to
witness something of the number engaged in carrying it. Thousands may be seen (in June and
August) filling their sacks, while a continual stream is on the wing, going and returning.

REMARKS.

The exact and uniform size of their cells is perhaps as great a mystery as anything pertaining
to them; yet, we find the second wonder before we are done with the first. In building comb,
they have no square or compass as a guide; no master mechanic takes the lead, measuring and
marking for the workmen; each individual among them is a finished mechanic! No time is lost
as an apprentice, no service given in return for instruction! Each is accomplished from birth!
All are alike; what one begins, a dozen may help to finish! A specimen of their work shows
itself to be from the hands of master workmen, and may be taken as a model of perfection! He,
who arranged the universe, was their instructor. Yes, a profound geometrician planned the first
cell, and knowing what would be their wants, implanted in the sensorium of the first bee, all
things pertaining to their welfare; the impress then given, is yet retained unimpaired! They
need no lectures on domestic economy to tell them, by using the base of one set of cells on
one side of their combs, for the base of those on the opposite, will save both labor and wax;
no mathematician that a pyramidal base, just three angles, with just such an inclination, will
be the exact shape needed, and consume much less wax than round or square--that the base of
one cell of three angles, would form a part of the base of three other cells on the opposite
side of the comb--that each of the six sides of one cell forms one side of six others around
it--that these angles and these only would answer their ends.

"The bees appear," says Reaumer, "to have a problem to solve, which would puzzle many a mathematician.
A quantity of matter being given, it is required to form out of it cells, which shall be equal,
and similar, and of a determinate size, but the largest possible with relation to the quantity
of matter employed, while they shall occupy the least possible space!"

 Now
let us compare advantages and disadvantages a little farther. One hive or a row of hives suspended,
or standing on a bench, two or three feet from the earth, when approached by the bees on a
chilly afternoon, (and we have many such in spring,) towards evening, even if there is not
much wind, they are very apt to miss the hive and bottom, and fall to the ground, so benumbed
with cold, as to be unable to rise again, and by the next morning are "no use" whatever. On
the other hand, if they are near the earth, with a board as described, there is no possibility
of their alighting under the hive, and if they should come short, and get on the ground, they
can always creep, long after they are too cold to fly, and are able, and often do enter the
hive without the necessity of using their wings.

Enough may be saved in one spring, from a few hives, in this way, to make a good swarm, which
taken from several is not perceived; yet, as much profit from them might be realized, as if
they were a swarm by themselves. A little contrivance is all that is needed to save them. To
such as must and will have them up away from the earth, I would say, do suggest some plan to
save this portion of your best and most willing servants; have an alighting board project in
front of the hive at least one foot, or a board long enough to reach from the bottom of the
hive to the ground, that they may get on that, and crawl up to the hive. Do you want the inducement?
Examine minutely the earth about your hives, towards sunset, some day in April, when the day
has been fair, with some wind, and chilly towards night, and you will be astonished at the
numbers that perish. Most of them will be loaded with pollen, proving them martyrs to their
own industry and your negligence. When I see a bench three feet high and no wider than the
bottom of the hive, perhaps a little less, and no place for the bees to enter but at the bottom,
and as many hives crowded on as it will hold, I no longer wonder that "bee-keeping is all in
luck;" the wonder is how they keep them at all. Yet it proves that, with proper management,
it is not so very precarious after all.

The necessary protection from the weather, for stocks, is a subject that I have taken some
pains to ascertain; the result has been, that the cheapest covering is just as good as any;
something to keep the rain and rays of the sun from the top, is all sufficient. Covers for
each hive, like the bottom-board, should be separate, and some larger than the top.

UTILITY OF BEE-HOUSES DOUBTED.

I have used bee-houses, but they will not pay, and are also discarded. They are objectionable
on account of preventing a free circulation of air; also, it is difficult to construct them,
so that the sun may strike the hives both in the morning and afternoon; which in spring is
very essential. If they front the south, the middle of the day is the only time when the sun
can reach all the hives at once; this is just when they need it least; and in hot weather,
sometimes injurious by melting the combs. But when the hives stand far enough apart, on my
plan, it is very easily arranged to have the sun strike the hive in the morning and afternoon,
and shaded from ten o'clock, till two or three, in hot weather.

Notwithstanding our prodigality in building a splendid bee-house, we think of economy when
we come to put our hives in, and get them too close. "Can't afford to build a house, and give
them so much room, no how."

CHAPTER VIII.

ROBBERIES.

Robbing is another source of occasional loss to the apiarian. It is frequent in spring, and
at any time in warm weather when honey is scarce. It is very annoying, and sometimes gets neighbors
in contention, when perhaps neither is to blame, farther than ignorance of the matter.

NOT PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD.

A person keeping many hives must expect to be accountable for all losses in his neighborhood,
whether they are lost by mismanagement or want of management. Many people suppose, if one person
has but one stock, and another has ten, that the ten will combine for plundering the one. There
are no facts, showing any communication between different families of the same apiary, that
I can discover. It is true, when one family finds another weak and defenceless, possessing
treasure, they have no conscientious scruples about carrying off the last particle. The hurry
and bustle attending it seldom escape the notice of the other families; and when one hive has
been robbed in an apiary, perhaps two-thirds of the other families, sometimes all, have participated
in the plunder. One family, if it be large, is just as likely, and more so, to find a weak
one among the ten, and commence plundering, as the other way.

IMPROPER REMEDIES.

Notwithstanding it is common to hear remarks like this, "I had a first-rate hive of bees,"
(when the fact was he had not looked particularly at his bees for a month, to know whether
it was so or not, and if he had, very likely would not know,) "and Mr. A.'s bees began to rob
them. I tried every thing to stop it; I moved them around in several places to prevent their
finding the hive. It did no good; the first I knew they were all gone--bees, honey, and all!
The bees all joined the robbers." Now the fact is, that not one good stock of bees in fifty,
will ever be robbed, if let alone; that is, if the entrance is properly protected. This moving
the hive was enough to ruin any stock; bees were lost at every change, until nothing was left
but honey to tempt the robbers; whereas, if left on its stand, it might have escaped.

A great many remedies have been given me gratis, which, had one-half been followed, would have
ruined them. The fact is, with many people, the remedies are often the cause of the disease.
The most fatal is, to move them a few rods; another, to close the hive entirely, (very liable
to smother them); or, break out some comb and set the honey to running. There are some charms
that affect them but little any way. Probably there are but few bee-keepers able to tell at
once, when bees are being robbed. It requires the closest scrutinizing observation to decide.

DIFFICULTY IN DECIDING.

There is nothing about the apiary more difficult to determine, nothing more likely than to
be deceived. It is generally supposed, when a number are outside fighting, that it is conclusive
that they are also robbing, which is seldom the case. On the contrary, a show of resistance
indicates a strong colony, and that they are disposed to defend their treasures. I no longer
have any fears for a stock that has courage to repel an attack.

WEAK FAMILIES IN MOST DANGER.

It is weak families, that show no resistance, where we find the most danger. In seasons of
scarcity, all good stocks maintain or keep sentinels about the entrance, whose duty it appears
to be to examine every bee that attempts to enter. If it is a member of the community, it is
allowed to pass; if not, it is examined on the spot. It would seem that a password was requisite
for admittance, for no sooner does a stranger-bee endeavor to get in, than it is known. If
without necessary credentials, there is evidence enough against it. Each bee is a qualified
jurist, judge, and executioner. There is no delay; no waiting for witnesses for defence. The
more a bee attempts to escape, the more likely it will be to receive a sting, unless it succeeds.
How strange bees are known, would be nothing but theory, if I should attempt to explain. Let
it suffice that they are known.

THEIR BATTLES.

I will here describe some of their battles. I have in the spring frequently seen the whole
front side of the hive covered with the combatants, (but for such hives I have no fears; they
are able to defend themselves.) Several will surround one stranger; one or two will bite its
legs, another the wings; another will make a feint of stinging, while another is ready to take
what honey it has, when worried sufficient to make it willing. It is sometimes allowed to go
after yielding all its honey, but at others, is dispatched with a sting, which is almost instantly
fatal. A bee is killed sooner by a sting, than by any other means, except crushing. Sometimes
a leg will tremble, for a minute; the legs are drawn close to the body; the abdomen contracts
to half its usual size, unless filled with honey. I have known a pint accidentally to enter
a neighboring stock, and be killed in five minutes. The only places the sting will penetrate
a bee are the joints of the abdomen, legs, the neck, &c. I have occasionally seen one bee drag
about the dead body of its victim, being unable to withdraw its sting from a joint in the leg.
During the fight, if it be to keep off those in search of plunder, a few bees may be seen buzzing
around in search of a place unguarded to enter the hive. If such is found, it alights and enters
in a moment. At other times, when about to enter, it meets a soldier on duty, and is on the
wing again in an instant. But another time it may be more unfortunate, and be nabbed by a policeman,
when it must either break away, or suffer the penalty of insect justice, which is generally
of the utmost severity.

BAD POLICY TO RAISE THE HIVES.

A great many apiarians raise their hives an inch from the board early in spring. They seem
to disregard the chance it gives robbers to enter on every side. It is like setting the door
of your own house open, to tempt the thief, and then complain of depravity.

Let it be understood, then, that all good stocks, under ordinary circumstances, will take care
of themselves. Nature has provided means of defence, with instinct to direct its use. Non-resistance
may do for highly cultivated intellect in man, but not here.

INDICATIONS OF ROBBERS.

We will now notice the appearance about a weak hive that makes no resistance, and show the
result to be a total loss of the stock, without timely interference. Each robber, when leaving
the hive, instead of flying in a direct line to its home, will turn its head towards the hive
to mark the spot, that it may know where to return for another load, in the same manner that
they do when leaving their hive in the spring. The first time the young bees leave home, they
mark their location, by the same process. A few of these begin to hatch from the cells very
early; in all good stocks, often before the weather is warm enough for any to leave the hive.
Consequently, it cannot be too early for them at any time in spring. These young bees, about
the middle of each fair day, or a little later, take a turn of flying out very thickly for
a short time. The inexperienced observer would be very likely to suppose such stock very prosperous,
from the number of inhabitants in motion. This unusual bustle is the first indication of foul
play, and should be regarded with suspicion; yet it is not conclusive.

A DUTY.

It is the duty of every bee-keeper, who expects to succeed, to know which his weak stocks are;
an examination some cool morning, can be made by turning the hive bottom up, and letting the
sun among the combs. The number of inhabitants in them is easily seen. When weak, close the
entrance, till there is just room for one bee to pass at once. The first real pleasant days,
at any time before honey is obtained plentifully, a little after noon, look out for them to
commence robbing. Whenever a weak stock is taken with what appears to be a fit of unusual industry,
it is quite certain they are either robbers or young bees; the difficulty is to decide which.
Their motions are alike, but there is a little difference in color--the young bees are a shade
lighter; the abdomen of the robbers, when filled with honey, is a little larger. It requires
close, patient observation, to decide this point, and when you have watched close enough to
detect this difference, you can decide without trouble.

A TEST.

But while you are learning this nice distinction, your bees may be ruined. We will, therefore,
give some other means of protection.

Bees, when they have been stealing a sack of honey from a neighboring hive, will generally
run several inches from the entrance before flying: kill some of these; if filled with honey,
they are robbers; because it is very suspicious, to be filled with honey when leaving the hive;
or sprinkle some flour on them as they come out, and have some one watch by the others to see
if they enter. Another way is less trouble, but will take longer, before they are checked,
if robbing. Visit them again in the course of half an hour or more, after the young bees have
had time to get back, (if it should happen to be them); but if the bustle continues or increases,
it is time to interfere. When the entrance has been contracted as directed, close it entirely
till near sunset. When it has been left without, it should now be done, (giving room for only
one bee at a time). This will allow all that belong to the hive to get in, and others to get
out, and materially retard the progress of the robbers.

ROBBING USUALLY COMMENCES ON A WARM DAY.

Unless it should be cool, they will continue their operations till evening. Very often some
are unable to get home in the dark, and are lost. This, by the way, is another good test of
robbing. Visit the hives every warm evening. They commence depredations on the warmest days;
seldom otherwise. If any are at work when honest laborers should be at home, they need attention.

REMEDIES.

As for remedies, I have tried several. The least trouble is to remove the weak hive in the
morning to the cellar, or some dark, cool place, for a few days, until at least two or three
warm days have passed, that they may abandon the search. The robbers will then probably attack
the stock on the next stand. Contract the entrance of this in accordance with the number of
bees that are to pass. If strong, no danger need be apprehended; they may fight, and even kill
some; perhaps a little chastisement is necessary, to a sense of their duty.

COMMON OPINION.

There is an opinion prevalent that robbers often go to a neighboring stock, kill off the bees
first, and then take possession of the treasures. To corroborate this matter, I have never
yet discovered one fact, although I have watched very closely. Whenever bees have had all their
stores taken, at a period when nothing was to be had in the flowers, it is evident they must
starve, and last but a day or two before they are gone. This would naturally give rise to the
supposition that they were either killed, or gone with the robbers.

A CASE IN POINT.

I have a case in point. Having been from home a couple of days, I found, on my return, a swarm
of medium strength, that had been carelessly exposed, had been plundered of about fifteen pounds
of honey, every particle they had.[13] About the usual number of bees were among the combs,
to all appearance, very disconsolate. I at once removed them to the cellar, and fed them for
a few days. The other bees gave over looking for more plunder, in the meantime. It was then
returned to the stand, entrance nearly closed, as directed, &c. In a short time it made a valuable
stock; but had I left it twenty-four hours longer, it probably would not have been worth a straw.

      [13] It occurred the last of July.

FURTHER DIRECTIONS.

When a stock has been removed, if the next stand contains a weak, instead of a strong one,
it is best to take that in also; to be returned to the stand as soon as the robbers will allow
it. If a second attack is made, put them in again, or if practicable, remove them a mile or
two out of their knowledge of country; they would then lose no time from labor. Where but few
stocks are kept, and not more than one or two stocks are engaged, sprinkle a little flour on
them as they leave, to ascertain which the robbers are; then reverse the hives, putting the
weak one in the place of the strong, and the strong one in the place of the weak one. The weak
stock will generally become the strongest, and put a stop to their operations; but this method
is often impracticable in a large apiary; because several stocks are usually engaged, very
soon after one commences, and a dozen may be robbing one. Another method is, when you are sure
a stock is being robbed, take a time when there are as many plunderers inside as you can get,
and close the hive at once, (wire-cloth, or something to admit air, and at the same time confine
the bees, is necessary;) carry in, as before directed, for two or three days, when they may
be set out. The strange bees thus enclosed will join the weak family, and will be as eager
to defend what is now their treasure, as they were before to carry it off. This principle of
forgetting home and uniting with others, after a lapse of a few days, (writers say, twenty-four
hours is sufficient for them to forget home) can be recommended in this case. It succeeds about
four times in five, when a proper number is enclosed. Weak stocks are strengthened in this
way very easily; and the bees being taken from a number of hives, are hardly missed. The difficulty
is, to know when there are enough to be about equal, to what belongs to the weak stock; if
too few are enclosed, they are surely destroyed.

COMMON CAUSE OF COMMENCING.

After all, bees being robbed is like being destroyed by worms; a kind of secondary matter;
that is, not one strong stock in a hundred will ever be attacked and plundered on the first
onset. Bees must be first tempted, and rendered furious by a weak hive; a dish of refuse honey
set near them is sometimes sufficient to set them at work, also where they have been fed and
not had a full supply. After they have once commenced, it takes an astonishing quantity to
satiate their appetite. They seem to be perfectly intoxicated, and regardless of danger; they
venture on to certain destruction! I have known a few instances where good stocks by this means
were reduced, until they in turn fell a prey to others. I have for several years kept about
one hundred stocks away from home, where I could not see them much, to prevent robbing. Yet
I never lost a stock by this cause. I simply keep the entrance closed, except a passage for
the bees at work during spring. It is true I have lost a few stocks, when the other bees took
the honey, but they would have been lost any way.

SPRING THE WORST TIME.

As I before remarked in the commencement of this chapter, bees will plunder and fight at any
time through the summer, when honey cannot be collected; but spring is the only time that such
desperate and persevering efforts are made to obtain it. It is the only time the apiarian can
be excused for having his hives plundered, or letting them stand in a situation for it. We
then often have families reduced in winter and spring, from various causes, and when protected
through this season, generally make good stocks. It is then we wish them to form steady, industrious
habits, and not live by plunder. Prevention is better than cure; evil propensities should be
checked in the beginning. The bee, like man, when this disposition has been indulged for a
time, it is hard breaking the habit; a severe chastisement is the only cure; they too go on
the principle of much wanting more.

NO NECESSITY TO HAVE THE BEES PLUNDERED IN THE FALL.

The apiarian having his bees plundered in the fall, is not fit to have charge of them; their
efforts are seldom as strong as in spring, (unless there is a general scarcity,) the weak hives
are usually better supplied with bees, and consequently a less number is exposed; but yet,
when there are some very weak families, these should be taken away as soon as the flowers fail,
or strengthened with bees from another hive. Particulars in fall management.

I have sometimes made my swarms equal, early in spring, by the following method, and I have
also failed. Bees, when wintered together in a room, will seldom quarrel when first set out.
When one stock has an over supply of bees, and another a very few, the next day or two after
being out, I change the weak one to the stand of the strong one, (as mentioned a page or two
back,) and all bees that have marked the location return to that place. The failure is, when
too many leave the strong stock, making that the weak one, when nothing is gained. If it could
be done when they had been out of the house just long enough for the proper number to have
marked the location, success would be quite certain. But before an exchange of this kind is
made, it would be well, if possible; to ascertain what is the cause of a stock being weak;
if it is from the loss of a queen, (which is sometimes the case,) we only make the matter worse
by the operation. To ascertain whether the queen be present, do not depend on the bees carrying
in pollen; as most writers assert they will not, when the queen is gone; because I have known
them do it so many times without, that I can assure the reader again, it is no test whatever.
The test given in chapter III. page 73, is always certain.

CHAPTER IX.

FEEDING.

SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT.

Feeding bees in spring is sometimes absolutely necessary; but in ordinary seasons and circumstances,
it is somewhat doubtful if it is the surest road to success, for the apiarian to attempt wintering
any stock so poorly supplied with honey, that he feels satisfied will need feeding in the spring
or before. I will recommend in another place (in fall management) what I consider a better
disposition of such light families. But as some stocks are either robbed, or from some other
cause, consume more honey than we expect, a little trouble and care may save a loss. Also bees
are often fed at this season to promote early swarming, and filling boxes with surplus honey.

CARE NEEDED.

Considerable care is requisite, and but few know how to manage it properly. Honey fed to bees,
is almost certain to get up quarrels among them. Sometimes strong stocks scent the honey given
to weak ones, and carry it off as fast as supplied.

APPARENT CONTRADICTION WHEN FEEDING CAUSING STARVATION.

It is possible that feeding a stock of bees in spring, may cause them to starve! whereas, if
let alone, they might escape. Notwithstanding this looks like a contradiction, I think it appears
reasonable. Whenever the supply of honey is short, probably not more than one egg in twenty
which the queen deposits, will be matured--their means not allowing the young brood to be fed.
This appears from the fact that several eggs may be found in one cell. I transferred over twenty
stocks in March, 1852--most of the cells occupied with eggs contained a plurality; two, three,
and even four, were found in one cell; it is evident that all could not be perfected. Also,
the fact of these eggs being at this season on the bottom-board. Now suppose you give such
a stock two or three pounds of honey, and they are encouraged to feed a large brood, and your
supply fails before they are half grown. What are they to do? destroy the brood and lose all
they have fed, or draw on their old stores for a small quantity to help them in this emergency,
and trust to chance for themselves? The latter alternative will probably be adopted, and then,
without a timely intervention of favorable weather, the bees starve. The same effect is sometimes
produced by the changes of the weather; a week or two may be very fine and bring out the flowers
in abundance--a sudden change, perhaps frost, may destroy all for a few days. This makes it
necessary to use considerable vigilance, as these turns of cold weather (when they occur) make
it unsafe, till white clover appears; but if the spring is favorable, there is but little danger,
unless they are robbed. If you take the necessary care about worms, you will know which are
light, and which heavy, unless your hives are suspended; even then, it is a duty to know their
true condition, in this respect. This is another advantage of the simple hive; merely raising
one edge to destroy worms, tells you something about the honey on hand. To be very exact, the
hive should be weighed when ready for the bees, and the weight marked on it; by weighing at
any time after, tells at once within a few pounds of what honey there is on hand. Some allowance
must be made for the age of the combs, the quantity of brood, &c. It is wrong to begin to feed
without being prepared to continue to do so, as the supply must be kept up till honey is abundant.

HOW LONG IT WILL DO TO WAIT BEFORE FEEDING.

If it is wished to wait as long as possible, and not lose the bees, a test will be necessary
to decide how long it will do to delay feeding. In this case, strict attention will be necessary;
they will need examination every morning. If a light tap on the hive is answered b; a brisk,
lively buzzing, they are not suffering yet; but if no answer is returned to your inquiry, it
indicates a want of strength. Extreme destitution destroys all disposition to repel an attack.
Sometimes a part of the bees will be too weak to remain among the combs, and will be lying
on the bottom, and some few outside. If the weather is cool, they appear to be lifeless; yet
they can be revived, and now must he fed.

DIRECTIONS FOR FEEDING.

Those among the combs may be able to move, though feebly. When this is the condition of things,
invert the hive, gather up all the scattered bees, and put them in. Get some honey; if candied,
heat it till it dissolves; comb honey is not so good without mashing; if no honey is to be
had, brown sugar may be taken instead; add a little water, and boil it till about the consistence
of honey, and skim it; when cool enough, pour a quantity among the combs, directly on the bees;
cover the bottom of the hive with a cloth, securing it firmly, and bring to the fire to warm
up. In two or three hours they will be revived, and may be returned to the stand, providing
the honey given is all taken up; on no account let any honey run out around the bottom. The
necessity of a daily visit to the hives is apparent from the fact, that if left over for one
day, in the situation just described, it will be too late to revive them. At night, if you
have a box cover, such as I have recommended, you may open the holes in the top of the hive;
fill a small baking dish with honey or syrup, and set it on the top; put in some shavings to
keep the bees from drowning, or a float may be used if you choose; it should be made of some
very light wood, very thin, and full of holes or narrow channels, made with a saw. At the commencement
of feeding, a few drops should be scattered on the top of the hive and trailed to the side
of the dish, to teach them the way; after feeding a few times, they will know the road. When
the weather is warm enough for them to take it during the night, it is best to feed at evening,--from
four to eight ounces daily, is sufficient. If the family is very small, what honey is left
in the morning may attract other bees; it is then best to take it out, or carry the hive in
the house to a dark room, sufficiently warm, and feed them enough to last several days, and
then return them to the stand; keeping a good lookout that they are not plundered, and again
in a starving condition, until flowers produce honey sufficient.

WHOLE FAMILIES MAY DESERT THE HIVE.

When you have the means to keep up a supply of food, and time requisite to make feeding secure,
perhaps it would not be advisable to wait till the last extremity before feeding, as a small
family will sometimes entirely desert the hive, when destitute, if it occurs before they have
much brood. In these cases, they issue precisely as a swarm; after flying a long time, they
either return, or unite with some other stock. If they return, they need attention immediately.
You may be certain there is something wrong, let the desertion take place when it may; in spring
it may be destitution, or mouldy combs; at other times the presence of worms, diseased brood,
&c. By whatever cause it is produced, ascertain it, and apply the remedy.

OBJECTIONS TO GENERAL FEEDING.

I have known it recommended, and practised by some apiarians, to feed bees all at once in the
open air, in a large trough; but whoever realizes much profit by this method, will be very
fortunate, as every stock in the neighborhood will soon scent it out, and carry off a good
share, and nearly every stock at home will be in contention, and great numbers killed; the
moment the honey is out, their attention is directed to other stocks. Another objection to
this general feeding is, that some stocks are not necessitated at all, while others need it;
but the strongest stock is pretty sure to get the most. NOW, as I cannot afford to divide with
my neighbors in this way of feeding, and I suppose but few will be found who are willing to
do it, I will give my method, which, when once arranged, is but little trouble.

ARRANGEMENT FOR FEEDING.

I got a tinman to make some dishes, two inches deep, 10×12 inches square, and perpendicular
sides. A board was then got out, fifteen inches wide, and two feet long; two inches from one
end, a hole is cut out the longest way, just the size of the dish, so that it will set in just
even with the upper side of the board; a good fit should be made, so that no bees can get in
around it; cleats should be nailed on the under side of the board, some over an inch thick,
to prevent crowding the dish out. This is to go directly under the hive, but it is not ready
yet, because if such dish is filled with honey under a hive, the bees would drown; if a float
is put on to keep them out, it will settle to the bottom when the honey is out, and the bees
cannot creep up the sides of tin very easily. Another thing, there is nothing to prevent the
bees from making their combs to the bottom of this dish, two inches below the bottom of the
hive; these things are to be prevented. Get out two pieces of half-inch board, ten inches long,
one to be two inches wide, the other one and a half inches. With a coarse or thick saw, cut
channels in the side of the strips, one-fourth inch deep, three-eighths or half an inch apart,
crosswise the whole length. You will then want a number corresponding to the places sawed,
of very thin shingles, or strips, say one-eighth of an inch thick, and one and three-fourths
wide, and nine and a half long; these are to stand edgewise in the dish; the first two are
to hold them in the channels at the ends. The narrow one needs a block one-half inch square,
nailed on each end; on the edge, a strip of wire cloth is then nailed on, making the whole
width just two inches. This is now put in the dish, wire cloth at the bottom, two inches from
one end; two pins to act as braces will keep it there; the other wide one is placed against
the other end, and pressed down even with the top of the dish. The thin pieces are now slipped
into the channels even with the top; it is now ready to go under the hive to be fed. Let the
two-inch space project out on the back side of the hive. A narrow board should be provided,
some more than two inches wide, to cover it. Let the hive stand close on this board; the hole
in the side is sufficient for the passage of bees at work, till very hot weather. Thus you
see that the hive covers all but the space behind, which the board covers, and not a strange
bee can get at the honey, without entering the hole at the side, and passing through among
the bees belonging to the hive, which they will not often do; if the family is numerous, it
makes it as safe as feeding on the top; with this advantage, there are no bees in the way to
interfere while pouring in the food. When the bees are to be fed, raise the board at the back
and pour in the honey; the wire-cloth in the bottom prevents all bees from entering this space,
at the same time will let the honey pass through directly under the bees, which will take it
up quicker than from any other place that I can put it; they will work all night even when
the weather is quite cool. This board and feeder can be taken out when done feeding, and put
away till wanted again; if left under through the summer, it affords the worms a place rather
too convenient to spin their cocoons, where they are not easily destroyed.

FEEDING TO INDUCE EARLY SWARMS.

If the object in feeding is to induce early swarms, of course the best stocks should be chosen
for the purpose; but some care is necessary not to give too much, and fill the combs with honey,
that ought to be filled with brood, and thereby defeat your object; one pound per day is enough,
perhaps too much. The quantity obtained from flowers is a partial guide; when plenty, feed
less; when scarce, more. Begin as soon as you can make them take it up in spring, and continue
in accordance with the weather, till white clover blossoms, or swarms issue. Another object
in feeding bees at this period, is to have the store combs all filled with inferior honey,
so that when clover appears, (which yields our best honey,) there is no room except in the
boxes to store it, which are now put on, and rapidly filled. When this last object is alone
wished for, it is not much matter how much is given at a time, providing it is all taken up
through the night; it will then take no time in day-light, when they might work on flowers;
also, the bees would have no trouble in repelling any attempt of others to get at it.

WHAT MAY BE FED.

Inferior honey may be used for this purpose; Southern or West India is good, and costs but
little. Even molasses sugar mixed with it will do; but they do not relish it so well when fed
without the honey. I have usually taken about equal quantities of each, adding a pint of water
to ten pounds of this mixture, and making it as hot as it will bear without boiling over, and
skimming it.

IS CANDIED HONEY INJURIOUS?

There has an idea been advanced, that candied honey is injurious to bees, even said to be fatal.
I never could discover any thing further, than it was a perfect waste, while in this state.
When boiled, and a little water added, it appears to be just as good as any. Nearly every stock
will have more or less of it on hand at this season; but as warm weather approaches, and the
bees increase to warm the hive, it seems to get liquified, from this cause alone. The bees,
when compelled to use honey from these cells, thus candied, waste a large portion; a part is
liquid, and the rest is grained like sugar, which may be seen on the bottom-board, as the bees
work it out very often. Another object in feeding bees, is to give inferior honey, mixed with
sugar and flavored to suit the taste, to the bees, and let them store it in boxes for market.
Now, I have no faith in honey undergoing any chemical change in the stomach of the bee,[14]
and cannot recommend this as the honest course. Neither do I think it would be very profitable,
feeding to this extent, under any circumstances. I have a few times had some boxes nearly finished
and fit for market at the end of the honey season; a little more added would make them answer.
I have then fed a few pounds of good honey, but always found that several pounds had to be
given the bees to get one in the boxes.

      [14] Mr. Gillman's patent for feeding bees, is based on the
      principle of a chemical change. It is said that the food he gives
      to the bees, when poured into the cells, becomes honey of the
      first quality. This appears extremely mysterious; for it is well
      understood that when a bee has filled its sack it will go to the
      hive, deposit its load, and return immediately for more; and will
      continue its labor throughout the day, or until the supply fails;
      each load occupying but few minutes. The time in going from the
      feeder to the hive is so short that a change so important is not
      at all probable. The nature of bees seems to be to collect
      honey, not make it; hence we find, when bees are gathering from
      clover, they store quite a different article than when from
      buckwheat,--or when we feed West India honey, in quantities
      sufficient to have it stored pure in the boxes, we find that it
      has lost none of its bad taste in passing through the sacks of
      our northern bees.

      It appears most probable that, if Southern honey and cheap sugar
      form the basis of his food, (which it is said to,) that it is
      flavored with something to disguise the disagreeable qualities of
      the compound. Should this be the secret, it would seem like a
      waste to feed it to bees--a portion would be given to the brood,
      and possibly the old bees might not always refrain from sipping a
      little of the tempting nectar. Why not, when the compound was
      ready,--instead of wasting it by this process,--put it directly
      in market? Or, is it necessary to have it in the combs to help
      psychologize the consumer into the belief that it is honey of a
      pure quality?

CHAPTER X.

DESTRUCTION OF WORMS.

I shall not give a full history of the moth in this chapter, as spring is not the time they
are most destructive. It will be further noticed under the head of Enemies of Bees. But as
this is a duty belonging to spring, a partial history seems necessary.

As soon as the bees commence their labors, the worms are generally ready to begin theirs.

SOME IN THE BEST STOCKS.

You will probably find some in your best stocks; but don't be frightened; this is not the season
when they often destroy your stocks, yet they injure them some.

HOW FOUND.

In the morning, when cool, raise the hive, and you will find them on the board. You must not
suppose that these chaps are bred outside the hive, got their growth, and are now on their
way among the bees, but the reverse. They are bred in the hive, and most of them are on the
way out, and this is the precise time to arrest them and bring them to justice for their crimes.

A TOOL FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION.

I have used a simple tool, made in a few minutes, and very convenient in this business. Any
one can make it. Get a piece of narrow hoop-iron, (steel would be better,) three-fourth inch
wide, five inches long; taper from one side three inches from the end to a point; then grind
each edge sharp; make three or four holes through the wide end, to admit small nails through
it in the handle, which should be about two feet long and about half an inch square. Armed
with this weapon, you can proceed. Raise the hive on one edge, and with the point of your sword
you may pick a worm out of the closest corner, and easily scrape all from under the hive with
it. Now, be sure and dispatch every one; not that the "little victim" will itself, personally,
do much mischief; but through its descendants the mischief is to be apprehended. Very likely
half of all you find will have finished their course of destruction, among the combs, and have
voluntarily left them for a place to spin their cocoons. They are worried by the bees, if they
are numerous, until satisfied that it is no safe place among them to make a shroud and remain
helpless two or three weeks. Accordingly, when they get their growth they leave, get on the
board on the bottom, become chilled and helpless in the morning, but again active by the middle
of the day. Now, if they are merely thrown on the earth, a place there will be selected, if
no better is found, for transformation; and a moth perfected ten feet from the hive is just
as capable of depositing five hundred eggs in your hive, as if she had never left it.

Several generations are matured in the course of one summer: consequently, one destroyed at
this season, may prevent the existence of thousands before the summer is over.

This is another subject of theoretical reasoning, and imposition, (at least in my opinion.)
I wish the reader to judge for himself; get rid of whims and prejudice, and look at the subject
candidly and fair; and if there is no corroborative testimony comes up to confirm any position
that I assume, I shall not complain if my assertions fare no better than some others. Only
defer judgment till you know for yourself.

Bees have ever received my especial regard and attention; and my enthusiasm may blind my judgment.
I may be prejudiced, but will not be wilfully wrong. I have found so many theories utterly
false, when carried out in practice, that I can depend on no one's hypothesis, however plausible,
without facts in practice to support it. No one should be fully credited without a test. To
return to our subject.

MISTAKEN CONCLUSIONS.

It is supposed by many, when these worms are found on the board, they get there by accident,
having dropped from the combs above. They seem not to understand that the worm generally travels
on safe principles; that is, he attaches a thread to whatever he travels over. To be satisfied
on this point, I have many times carefully detached his foot-hold, when on the side of the
hive or other place, where he would fall a few inches, and always found him with a thread fast
at the place he left, to enable him to regain his position if he chose. Is it not probable,
then, that whenever he leaves the combs for the bottom-board, he can readily ascend again?
No doubt he often does, to be driven down again by the bees. Now, what I wish to get at by
all this preamble, is simply this: that all our trouble and worrying to prevent the worms from
again ascending to the combs--by wire hooks, wire pins, screws, nails, turned pins, clam-shells,
blocks of wood, &c., is perfect nonsense, when half or more of them would not harm the bees
any more if they did, and might as well go there as any where else. Besides, these useless
"fixins" are very often a positive injury to the bees.

OBJECTIONS TO SUSPENDED BOTTOM-BOARD.

Suppose, if you please, that the worm has no thread attached above, and your board is far enough
from the bottom of the hive to prevent his reaching it. Of course, he can't get up; but how
are your bees to do any better? The worm can reach as high as they can. The bee can fly up,
you think; so it will, sometimes; but will try a dozen times first to get up without, and when
it does, it is a very bad position to start from, being a smooth board. In hot weather it does
better. Did you ever watch by a hive thus raised, in April or May, towards night, when it was
a little cool, and see the industrious little insects arrive with a load as heavy as they could
possibly carry, all chilly, and nearly out of breath, scarcely able to reach home, and there
witness their vain attempts to get among their fellows above them? If you never witnessed this,
I wish you would take some pains for it, and when you find them giving up in despair, when
too chilly to fly, and perishing after many fruitless attempts for life, I think, if you possess
sympathy, benevolence, or even selfishness, you will be induced to do as I did--discard at
once wire hooks and all else from under the hive in the spring, and give the bees, when they
do get home with a load, under such circumstances, what they richly deserve, and that is, protection.

ADVANTAGE OF THE HIVE CLOSE TO THE BOARD.

An inch hole in the side of the hive, a few inches from the bottom, as a passage for the bees,
is needed, as I shall recommend letting the hive close to the board; it is essential on account
of robbing; also, it is necessary to confine as much as possible the animal heat, in most hives,
during the season the bees are engaged in rearing young brood; and warmth is necessary to hatch
the eggs, and develop the larvæ; we all know that when the hive is close, less heat will pass
off than if raised an inch.

OBJECTION ANSWERED.

You object to this, and tell me, "the worms will get between the bottom of the hive and the
board." Well, I think they will, and what then? Why I expect if you intend to succeed, that
you will get them out, and crush their heads; if you cannot give as much attention as this,
better not keep them, or let some one have the care of them that will. I am as willing to find
a worm under the edge of the hive, and dispatch it, as to have it creep into some place out
of sight, and change to the moth. I once trimmed off the bottom of my hives to a thin edge,
so they did not have this place for their cocoons, but now prefer to have them square. All
profit is seldom obtained with anything. If you plant a field with corn, you do not expect
that the whole work for the crop is finished. Neither should you expect when you set up a stock
of bees, that a full yield will be realized without something more. If you are remunerated
by keeping the weeds from your corn, be assured it is equally profitable to weed out your bees.

INSUFFICIENCY OF INCLINED BOTTOM-BOARD.

Now do not be deceived in this matter, and through indolence be induced to get those hives
with descending bottom-boards, to throw out the worms as they fall, and hope by that means
to get rid of the trouble; (I have already, in another chapter, expressed doubts of this).
But we will now suppose such descending bottom-boards capable of throwing every worm that touches
it "heels over head" to the ground; what have we gained? His neck is not broken, nor any other
bone of his body! As if nothing extraordinary had happened, he quietly gathers himself up,
and looks about for snug quarters; he cares not a fig for the hive now; he gormandized on the
combs until satisfied, before he left them, and is glad to get away from the bees any how.
A place large enough for a cocoon is easily found, and when he again becomes desirous of visiting
the hives, it is not to satisfy his own wants, but to accommodate his progeny; he is then furnished
with wings ample to carry him to any height that you choose to put your bees.

A MOTH CAN GO WHERE BEES CAN.

A hive that is proof against the moth, is yet to be constructed. We frequently hear of them,
but when they come to be tested, somehow these worms get where the bees are. When your hives
become so full of bees, that they cover the board in a cool morning, the worms will be seldom
found there, except under the edge of the hive.

TRAP TO CATCH WORMS.

You may now raise it, but you may still catch the worms by laying under the bees a narrow shingle,
a stick of elder split in two lengthwise, and the pith scraped out, or anything else that will
afford them protection from the bees, and where they may spin their cocoons. These should be
removed every few days, and the worms destroyed, and the trap put back. Do not neglect it till
they change to the moth, and you have nothing but to remove the empty cocoon.

BOX FOR WREN.

If you would take the trouble to put up a cage or two for the wren to nest in, he would be
a valuable assistant in this department of your labor. He would be on the lookout when you
were away, and many worms, while looking up a hiding-place in some corner, would be relieved
from all further trouble by being deposited in his crop. The cage for him need not be more
than four inches square; it may be fastened near as possible to the bees; to a post, tree,
or side of some building a few feet high. I have seen the skull of some animal (horse or ox)
used, and is very convenient for them, the cavity for the brains being used for the nest. A
person once told me the wren would not build in one that he had put up. On examination, the
stake to support it was found driven into the only entrance. I mention this to show how little
some people understand what they do. It is sometimes well enough to know why a thing is to
be done, as to know it must be done. I could tell you to do a great many things, but then you
would like to know why, then how to do it. Now if this prolixity is unnecessary for you, another
may need it. You must remember I am endeavoring to teach some few to keep bees, who are not
over supplied with ingenuity.

CHAPTER XI.

PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF BOXES.

Putting on boxes may be considered a duty intermediate between spring and summer management.
I cannot recommend putting them on as early as the last of April, or first of May, in ordinary
circumstances. It is possible to find a case that it would be best. But before the hive is
full of bees it is generally useless, very likely a disadvantage, by allowing a portion of
animal heat to escape that is needed in the hive to mature the brood. Also, moisture may accumulate
until the inside moulds, &c. Some experience and judgment is necessary to know about what time
boxes are needed. That boxes are needed at the proper season, I think I shall not need an argument
to convince any one, in the present day. Bee-keepers have generally discarded the barbarous
practice of killing the bees to obtain the honey. Many of them have learned that a good swarm
will store sufficient honey for winter, besides several dollars worth as profit in boxes.

ADVANTAGE OF THE PATENT VENDER.

Here is where the patent vender has taken the advantage of our ignorance, by pretending that
no other hive but his ever obtained such quantities, or so pure in quality.

TIME OF PUTTING ON--RULE.

It is probable a great many readers will need the necessary observation to tell precisely when
the hive is full of honey; it may be full of bees, and not of honey. And yet the only rule
that I can give to be generally applied, is, when the bees begin to be crowded out, but a day
or two before would be just the right time, that is, when they are obtaining honey--(for it
should be remembered that they do not always get honey when beginning to cluster out). This
guide will do in place of a better one, which close observation and experience only can give.
By observing a glass hive attentively, in those cells that touch the glass on the edge of the
combs, whenever honey is being deposited here abundantly, it is quite evident that the flowers
are yielding it just then, and other stocks are obtaining it also. Now is the time, if any
cluster out, to put on the boxes. When boxes are made as I have recommended, that is, the size
containing 360 solid inches, it is advisable to put on only one at first; when this is full
either of bees or honey, and yet bees are crowded outside, the other can be added. This is
before swarming; too much room might retard the swarming a few days, but if crowded outside,
it indicates want of room, and the boxes can make but little difference. It is better to have
one box well filled than two half full, which might be the case if the bees were not numerous.
The object of putting on boxes before swarming, is to employ a portion of the bees, that otherwise
would remain idly clustering outside two or three weeks, as they often do, while preparing
the young queens for swarming. But when all the bees can be profitably engaged in the body
of the hive, more room is unnecessary.

MAKING HOLES AFTER THE HIVE IS FULL.

Whenever it is required to put boxes on a hive that has no holes through the top, it need not
prevent your getting a few pounds of the purest honey that may be had, just as well as to have
a portion of the bees idle. I always endeavor to ascertain in what direction the sheets of
comb are made, and then mark off the row of holes on the top, at right angles with them.

ADVANTAGE OF PROPER ARRANGEMENT.

Two inches being nearly the right distance, each one will be so made that a bee arriving at
the top of the hive between any two sheets will be able to find a passage into the box, without
the task of a long search for it; which I can imagine to be the case when only one hole for
a passage is made, or when the row of holes is parallel with the combs. A hive might contain
eight or ten sheets of comb, and a bee desirous of entering the box might go up between any
two, many times, before it found the passage. It has been urged that every bee soon learns
all passages and places about the hive, and consequently will know the direct road to the box.
This may be true, but when we recollect that all within the hive is perfect darkness--that
this path must be found by the sense of feeling alone--that this sense must be its guide in
all its future travels--that perhaps a thousand or two young workers are added every week,
and these have to learn by the same means--it would seem, if we studied our own interest, we
would give them all the facility possible for entering the boxes. What way so easy for them
as to have a passage, when they get to the top, between each comb? That bees do not know all
roads about the hive, can be partially proved by opening the door of a glass hive. Most of
the bees about leaving, instead of going to the bottom for their exit, where they have departed
many times, seem to know nothing of the way, but vainly try to get out through the glass, whenever
light is admitted.

I am so well convinced of this, that I take some pains to accommodate them with a passage between
each comb; they will then at least lose no time by mistakes between the wrong combs, crowding
and elbowing their way back through a dense mass of bees which impede every step, until again
at the top perhaps between the same combs, perhaps right, perhaps farther off than at first;
when I suppose they try it again; as boxes are filled sometimes under just such circumstances.

To assist them as much as possible, when new hives are used for swarms, I wait till the hive
is nearly filled before making the holes to ascertain the direction of the combs. We all know
it is uncertain which way the combs will be built, when the swarm is put in, unless guide-combs
are used.[15] When holes are made before the bees are put in, guide-combs as directed for boxes
should be put in; (of course they should cross at right angles the row of holes).

      [15] Perhaps Miner's cross-bar hive would do it.

DIRECTIONS FOR BORING HOLES IN FULL STOCKS.

To make holes in the top after the combs are made,--Mark out the top as directed for making
hives and boxes. A centre bit or an auger bit with a lip or barb is best, as that cuts down
a little faster than the chip is taken out, leaving it smooth; when nearly through, a pointed
knife can cut the remainder of the chip loose, and it can be taken out; if it is between the
combs, it is well; if directly over the centre of one, it is a little better; with the knife
take out a piece as large as a walnut; even if honey is in it, no harm will be done. The bees
will then have a passage through from either side of the comb.

After you have opened one hole, very likely the bees will want to see what is going on over
head, and walk out to reconnoitre. To prevent their interference, use some tobacco-smoke, and
send them down out of your way, till your hole is finished. Now lay over this a small stone
or block of wood, and make the others in the same way. When all are done, blow in some smoke
as you uncover them, and put on your box. This process is not half so formidable as it appears;
I have in this way bored hundreds. You will remember my hives are not as high as many others
keep them, they are in about as convenient a position as I can get them. This method saves
me the trouble of sticking the guide-combs in my hives; also, the necessity of covering or
stopping the holes. Dr. Bevan and some others have made a cross-bar hive, instead of nailing
on a top in the usual way; a half-inch board of the right length is cut into strips, some over
an inch wide, and half an inch apart, across the top. It is plain that in such a hive a bee
can pass into the box whenever it arrives at the top, without difficulty. I will here repeat
the objection to allowing too much room, to pass into the boxes, that you may see the disadvantages
of the extremes of too little and too much room. In these cross-bar hives, the animal heat
rises into the box from the main hive, making it as warm as below; the queen goes up with the
bees, and finding it warm and convenient for breeding, deposits her eggs; and young brood as
well as honey is found there. When we think it full, it is then indispensable to return it,
if taken off, till they hatch, (otherwise they spoil it by moulding), which makes the combs
dark, tough, &c. Another objection to such open tops is, that open bottom boxes must be used,
which are not half as neat for market.

TO BE TAKEN OFF WHEN FILLED.

This advantage attends glass boxes: while being filled, the progress can be watched till finished,
when they should be taken off to preserve the purity of the combs. Every day the bees are allowed
to run over them, renders them darker. Consequently, when our bees are a long time filling
a box, it is not as purely white as when filled expeditiously.

TIME TAKEN TO FILL A BOX.

Two weeks is the shortest time I ever had any filled and finished. This, of course, depends
on the yield of honey, and size of the swarm; three or four weeks are usually taken for the
purpose. I have before said that the first yield of honey nearly fails in this section, usually
about the 20th of July; there are some variations, later or earlier, according to the season.
In other places it may be much later.

WHEN TO TAKE OFF BOXES PART FULL.

It can be ascertained by occasionally raising the cover to your glass boxes. When no more is
being added, all boxes that are worth the trouble should be taken off; if left longer the comb
gets darker, and such cells of honey as are not sealed over, (and sometimes the majority are
such,) the bees generally remove down into the hive.

TOBACCO SMOKE PREFERRED TO SLIDES.

When boxes are to be taken off, if a slide of tin, zinc, &c., is used to close the holes, some
of the bees are apt to be crushed, others will find themselves minus a head, leg, or abdomen,
and all of them be irritable for several days. A little tobacco smoke is preferable, as it
keeps all quiet. Just raise the box to be taken off sufficient to puff under it some smoke,
and the bees will leave the vicinity of the holes in an instant; the box can then be removed,
and another put on if necessary, without exciting their anger in the least.

MANNER OF DISPOSING OF THE BEES IN THE BOXES.

Arouse the bees by striking the box lightly four or five times. If all the cells are finished,
and honey is still obtained, turn the box bottom up, near the hive from which it was taken,
so that the bees can enter it without flying; by this means you can save several young bees,
that have never left the hive and marked the location, and a few others too weak to fly, but
will follow the others into the hive; (such are lost when we are obliged to carry them at a
distance.) Boxes can be taken off either in the morning or evening; if in the morning, it may
stand several hours when the sun is not too hot, but on no account let it stand in the sun
in the middle of the day, as the combs will melt. The bees will all leave, sometimes in an
hour; at others they will not be out in three. They may be taken off at evening and stand till
morning, in fair weather; if not too cool, they are generally all out; but here is some risk
of the moth finding it and depositing her eggs; perhaps one in fifty may be thus found.

BEES DISPOSED TO CARRY AWAY HONEY.

When boxes are taken off at the end of the honey season, a different method of getting rid
of the bees must be adopted, or we lose our honey. Unless the combs are all finished, we lose
some then any way, as most of the bees fill themselves before leaving; they carry it home and
return for more immediately, and take it all, if not prevented. It has been recommended to
take it to some dark room with a small opening to let the bees out; in the course of the day
they will sometimes all leave; but this method I have found unsafe, as they sometimes find
the way back. When a large number of boxes are to be managed, a more expeditious mode is, to
have a large box with close joints, or an empty hogshead, or a few barrels with one head out,
set in some convenient place; put the boxes in, one above another, but not in a manner to stop
the holes; over the top throw a sheet of one thickness, a thin one is best, as it will let
through more light. The bees will leave the boxes, creep to the top, and get on the sheet;
take this off and turn it over a few times; in this way all may be got rid of without the possibility
of carrying off much honey. All that know the way will return to the hive, but a few young
ones are lost.

NOT DISPOSED TO STING.

They seldom offer to sting during this part of the operation, even when the box is taken off
without tobacco smoke, and carried away from the hive; after a little time, the bees finding
themselves away from home, lose all animosity.

As honey becomes scarce, less brood is reared; a great many cells that they occupied are soon
empty; also, several cells that contained honey have been drained, and used to mature the portion
of brood just started at the time of the failure. We can now understand, or think we do, why
our best stocks that are very heavy, that but a few days before were crowded for room and storing
in boxes, are now eager for honey to store in the hive; as there is abundant room for several
pounds. They will quickly remove to the hive the contents of any box left exposed; or even
risk their lives by entering a neighboring hive for it; after being allowed to make a beginning,
under such circumstances.

RULE.

During a yield of honey, take off boxes as fast as they are filled, and put on empty ones.
At the end of the season take all off. Not one stock in a hundred will starve that has worked
in boxes, that is, when the hive is the proper size, and full before adding the boxes, unless
robbed or other casualty.

CHAPTER XII.

SECURING HONEY FROM THE MOTH.

TWO THINGS TO BE PREVENTED.

When the boxes are free from the bees, two things are to be prevented, if we wish to save our
honey till cold weather. One is to keep out the worms, the other to prevent souring. The last
may be new to many, but some few of us have had it caused by dampness in warm weather. The
combs become covered with moisture, a portion of the honey becomes thin like water, and instead
of the saccharine qualities we have the acid. Remedy: keep perfectly dry and cool, if you can,
but dry at any rate.

APT TO BE DECEIVED ABOUT THE WORMS.

But the worms, you can surely keep them out, you think, since you can seal up the boxes perfectly
close, preventing the moth or even the smallest ant from entering! Yes, you may do this effectually,
but the worms will often be there somehow, unless in a very low temperature, such as a very
cool cellar, or in house, and then you have dampness to guard against. I have a little experience
in this matter that spoils your theory entirely. A dispute had this equivalence than excellent. Two. But religion,

The bees when first rising from the hive, describe circles of but few feet, but as they recede,
they spread over an area of several rods. Their movement are much slower than usual, in a few
minutes thousands may be seen revolving in every possible direction! A swarm may be seen and
heard, at a distance, where fifty hives, ordinarily at work, would not be noticed! When about
out of the hive, or soon after, some branch of a tree or bush is usually selected on which
to cluster. In less than half a minute after the spot is indicated, even when the bees are
spread over an acre, they are gathered in the immediate vicinity, and all cluster in a body
from five to ten minutes after leaving the hive. They should now be hived immediately, as they
show impatience if left long, especially in the sun; also, if another stock should send out
a swarm while they were hanging there, they would be quite sure to mix together.

MANNER OF HIVING CAN BE VARIED.

It makes but little difference what way they are put in the hive, providing they are all made
to go in. Proceed as is most convenient; an old table or bench is very good to keep them out
of the grass if there should happen to be any; if there is not much in the way, lay your bottom-board
on the ground, make it level, set your hive on it, and raise one edge an inch or more to give
the bees a chance to enter.

USUAL METHOD.

Cut off the branch with the bees, if it can be done as well as not, and shake it in front of
the hive, a portion will discover it, and will at once commence a vibration of their wings;
this, I suppose, is a call for the others. A knowledge of a new home being found seems to be
communicated in this way, as it is kept up until all are in. A great many are apt to stop about
the entrance, thereby nearly or quite closing it, and preventing others going in, when they
will gather on the outside. You can expedite the matter with a stick or quill, by gently pushing
them away; and another portion will enter. When gentle means will not induce them to go in,
in a reasonable time, and they appear obstinate, a little water sprinkled on them will facilitate
operations greatly, when nothing else will. (Be careful and not over-do the matter, by using
too much water, they can be so wet as not to move at all.)

When they cluster on a branch that you do not wish to cut off, place your bottom-board as near
as convenient; on it lay two sticks about an inch in diameter, of the same length: try the
hive, and see that all is right; then turn it bottom up, directly under the main part of the
cluster; if you have an assistant, let him jar the branch sufficiently to detach the bees;
most of them will fall directly into the hive. If no assistant is at hand it is unnecessary
to wait, (I have done it a hundred times without help); with the bottom of the hive strike
the under side of the branch hard enough to dislodge them, then turn it on the board; the sticks
will prevent the bottom crushing many bees.

WHEN OUT OF REACH.

I have gone up a ladder fifteen feet, got the bees in the hive in this way, and backed down
without difficulty. After putting the hive in its place, sometimes a part will go back; in
that case, a small branch full of leaves should be held directly under and close to them, and
as many jarred on it as possible. Hold this still, and shake the other to prevent their clustering
there; you will soon have them all collected, ready to bring down, and put by the hive. A handle
basket or large tin pan may be taken up the ladder instead of the hive, when they can be readily
emptied before it. But very few will fly out in coming down. If you succeed in getting nearly
all the bees in the first effort, and but few are left, merely shaking the branch will be sufficient
to prevent their holding fast, and will turn their attention to those below, where those which
have already found a hive will be doing their best to call them. When the hive is first turned
over, most of the bees fall on the board and rush out, but as soon as it is realized that a
home is found, a buzzing commences inside; this quickly communicates the fact to those outside,
which immediately turn about, facing the hive and hum in concert, while marching in.

Another plan may be adopted, even if fifteen feet high; when the branch is not too large, and
there is not too much in the way below it. Have ready two or three light poles of suitable
length; select such as have a branch at the upper end, large enough to hold a two-bushel basket.
This is raised directly under the swarm; with another pole, the bees are all dislodged, and
fall into the basket, and are quickly let down. Now, if you have got about all, throw a sheet
over for a few moments, to prevent their escape. They soon become quiet, and may be hived without
many going back to the branch, as they do, when attempting to hive them immediately.

I often have them begin to cluster near the ground, very conveniently for hiving. In such a
case, I do not wait for all to collect, but as soon as such place is indicated, I get the board
and hive ready. When a quart or so are gathered, shake them in a hive, and set it up; the swarm
will now go to that, instead of the branch, especially if the latter is shaken a little. Where
many stocks are kept, it is advisable to be as expeditious as possible. A swarm will thus hive
itself much sooner than when it is allowed to cluster.

WHEN THEY CANNOT BE SHAKEN OFF.

Swarms will sometimes get in places where it is impossible to jar them off, or cut off a branch,
such as the trunk of a tree, or a large limb near it. In which case place the hive near, as
first directed; take a large tin dipper, a vessel most convenient for the purpose, and dip
it full of bees; with one hand turn back the hive; with the other throw the bees into it; some
of them will discover that a home is provided, and set up the call for the rest, (by the vibration
of their wings), and the remainder may be emptied in front of the hive as you dip them off.
I have known a few instances when the first dipper full all ran out, and joined the others
without making the discovery that they were in a hive, but this is seldom the case. When you
get the queen in, there is no trouble with the remainder, even if there are many left; as soon
as they ascertain that the queen is no longer among them, it may be known by their uneasy movements,
and they will soon leave, and join those in the hive; but if the queen is yet on the tree,
and but a dozen with her, they will leave the hive and cluster again.

ALL SHOULD BE MADE TO ENTER.

In all cases be sure to get them all to enter; a cluster outside of it may contain the queen,
unconscious of a home so near; and the probable consequence might be, she would leave for a
miserable one in the woods.

SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE STAND IMMEDIATELY.

When all are in, except a few that will be flying, let the hive down close to the board; take
hold of this and carry it at once to the stand they are to occupy, and raise the front edge
half an inch; let the back rest on the board; this will give them means to re-ascend, if they
chance to drop, which large swarms often do in hot weather. If the bottom is an inch or more
from the board when the bees fall, there is nothing to prevent their rushing out on every side--their
means of getting up again are bad--if the queen comes out with the rush, there are some chances
for their leaving.

PROTECTION FROM THE SUN NECESSARY.

Another thing is very important; swarms should be protected from the sun for several days,
in hot weather, from nine o'clock till three or four; and then if the heat is very oppressive,
and the bees cluster outside, sprinkle them with water and drive them in; and by wetting the
hive occasionally, it will carry off a large portion of the heat, and make it much more comfortable.

CLUSTERING BUSHES.

If there are no large trees in the vicinity of your apiary, all the better, as there will then
be no danger of your swarms lighting on them; but all bee-keepers are not so fortunate, myself
being one of the number. In such a place it is necessary to provide something for them to cluster
on; get some bushes six or eight feet high (hemlock is preferable); cut off the ends of the
branches, except a few near the top: secure the whole with strings to prevent swaying in ordinary
winds; make a hole in the earth deep enough to hold them, and large enough to be lifted out
easily. The bees will be likely to cluster on some of these; they can then be raised out, and
the bees hived without difficulty. A bunch of dry mullein tops tied together on the end of
a pole, makes a very good place for clustering; it so nearly resembles a swarm that the bees
themselves appear to be sometimes deceived. I have frequently known them leave a branch where
they had begun to cluster, and settle on this when held near.

The motives for immediately removing the swarm to the stand are, that they are generally more
convenient to watch in case they are disposed to leave; also many bees can be saved. All that
leave the hive, mark the location the same as in spring; several hundreds will probably leave
the first day; a few may leave several times; when removed at night, such will return to the
stand of the previous day, and generally are lost; whereas, if they are carried at once to
a permanent stand, this loss is avoided.

Those that are left flying at the time, return to the old stock, which those that return from
the swarm the next day will not always do. The time for moving them now is no more than at
another. It is unnecessary to object, and say, that "it will take too long to wait for the
bees to get in;" this will not do. I shall insist on your getting all the bees to enter before
leaving any way. I consider this an essential feature in the management. I will not say that
my directions will always prevent their going to the woods, but this I do say, that out of
the hundreds that I have hived, not one has ever left. It is possible proper management has
had no influence in my success, yet something like an opinion of this kind has been indulged
for a long time.

HOW SWARMS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED THAT LEAVE FOR THE WOODS.

Some of my neighboring bee-keepers lose a quarter or half of their swarms by flight, and how
do they manage? When the word is given out, "Bees swarming," a tin-horn, tin-pan, bells, or
anything to make a "horrible din," is seized upon in the hurry of the moment, and as much noise
made as possible, to make them cluster; (which they naturally would do without the music, at
least all mine have. This probably gave rise to the opinion of one old lady, who knew "drumming
on a pan did good, for she had tried it.") Very often a hive is to be constructed, or an old
one unfit to use any way, needs some sticks across, or something to take time. When the hive
is obtained, it must be washed with something nice to make the bees like it; a little honey
must be daubed on the inside; sugar and water, molasses and water, salt and water, or salt
and water rubbed on with hickory leaves, "is the best thing in the world;" several other things
are just as good, and some are better. Even whisky, that bane of man, has been offered them
as a bribe to stay, and sometimes they are persuaded and go to work.

NOTHING BUT BEES NEEDED IN A HIVE.

Now I cannot say positively that these things do harm, yet I am quite sure they do no good,
as nothing but bees is needed in a hive. Is it reasonable to suppose they are fond of all the
"knick-knacks" given them? I have never used any, and could not possibly have done better.
I am careful to have the hive sweet and clean, and not too smooth inside; an old hive that
has been used before is scalded and scraped.

But to the manner they get the bees in, after the hive is ready. A table is set out, and a
cloth spread on it; sticks are put on to raise the hive an inch or more: if they succeed in
getting the swarm even on the outside of the hive it is left; if they go in, it is well; if
they go off, why hope for "better luck next time." The hive is left unsheltered in the hot
sun and when there is no wind, the heat is soon insupportable, or at least very oppressive;
the bees hang in loose strings, instead of a compact body, as when kept cool; they are very
apt to fall, and when they do, will rush out from every side: if the queen chances to drop
with them, they may "step out." Two thirds of all the bees that go to the woods are managed
in this, or a similar manner, and may it not be said, they are fairly driven off?

SELDOM GO OFF WITHOUT CLUSTERING.

Perhaps one swarm in three hundred will depart for the woods without first clustering. I have
had three times that number, not one of which has ever left me thus. Yet I have evidence not
to be disputed that some will do it. Three instances have occurred near me that satisfied me
of the fact. Two were lost, the other was followed to a tree, half a mile off; I assisted in
cutting the tree, and hiving them. The cavity where they entered was very small, and contained
old comb, made by a swarm a year or two previous, which had probably starved, as there was
too little room for storing sufficient honey for winter. This swarm, when hived and carried
home, remained perfectly contented.

DO SWARMS CHOOSE A LOCATION BEFORE SWARMING?

The inquiry is often made, Do all swarms have a place looked out before leaving the parent
stock? The answer to this must ever be guess-work. I could offer some circumstances indicating
the affirmative very strongly, and as much for the negative; and will let it pass at that.
Yet I think if bees are properly cared for, that ninety-nine swarms in a hundred will prefer
a good clean hive to a rotten tree in the woods.

MEANS OF ARRESTING A SWARM.

I have had three swarms that were exceptions to general rules, giving me some trouble by swarming
out after being hived; the third and fourth time they left, I threw water among them, causing
quite a shower; when my pail-full was out, I used earth; they went but a short distance, and
clustered in the usual way. Now were these bees intending to leave, and had their designs frustrated
by the water and earth? I am not quite as sure as the old lady, who knew that "drumming on
a tin-pan did good," but I am inclined to think it had some effect. I have heard of several
instances where swarms were apparently stopped, by having earth thrown among them, while passing
over a field where men were at work. We know they dislike being wet, as we see them hastening
home on the approach of a shower; or we can at any time drive them in the hive by sprinkling
them with water. Throwing water in the swarm is a kind of imitation shower, and earth is something
like it. Whether useful or not, these swarms leaving the hive was rather suspicious, and I
should try it again under similar circumstances.

SOME COMPULSION.

After getting them in the hive for the fourth time, I resolved not to be baffled or have much
more such trouble, and perhaps go to the woods at last, thereby setting a bad example. I put
under the hive the wire-cloth bottom-board, opened two or three holes on the top, and covered
these also with wire-cloth, (this was to let the air circulate); a quantity of honey and water
was given them and they were then carried to the cellar, and kept prisoners four days, except
half an hour before sunset; when too late to leave for a journey, I set them out to provide
a few necessaries, and then returned them to the cellar. In four days, when honey enough is
given them, a good swarm will half fill an ordinary hive with combs. Some of the first eggs
deposited will be about hatching into larvæ, all of which would seem like too much to leave.
I now set them out, and gave them liberty; shading the hive, &c., as before directed. They
all proved faithful and industrious, prospering like others. If their design was for a distant
location, they put a good face on the matter in the end.

HOW FAR WILL THEY GO IN SEARCH OF A HOME?

How far they will travel in search of a home, is also uncertain. I have heard of their going
seven miles, but could not learn how the fact was proved. I have no experience of my own in
this matter, but will relate a circumstance that happened near me a few years since. A neighbor
was ploughing, when a swarm passed over him; being near the earth, he "pelted them heartily"
with the loose dirt he had ploughed up, which seemed to bring them up, or rather down, as they
clustered on a very low bush; they were hived, and gave no further trouble. A man living some
three miles from this neighbor, on that day hived a swarm about eleven o'clock, and left them
to warm up in the sun as described a page or two back; about three o'clock their stock of patience
was probably exhausted, when they resolved to seek a better shelter. They put off in a great
hurry, not even waiting to thank their owner for the spread on his table, and the sweet-scented
"yarbs" and good things with which he had rubbed their hive. They gave him no notice whatever
of their intention to "quit," until they were moving! With all their goods ready packed, they
were soon under way, accompanied by their owner with music; but whether they marched with martial
precision, keeping time, is uncertain. In this case the bees took the lead; the man with his
tin-pan music kept the rear, and was soon at a respectful distance. They were either not in
a mood, just then, to be charmed by melodious sounds, or their business was too urgent to allow
them to stop and listen! Their means of locomotion being superior to his, he gave up in despair,
out of breath, after following about a mile. Another person, about the same time in the day,
saw a swarm moving in the same direction of the first; he also followed them till compelled
to yield to their greater travelling facilities. A third discovered their flight and attempted
a race, but like the others soon came out behind. The before-mentioned neighbor saw them, and
thought of the fresh earth that he had ploughed up, which he threw among them till they stopped.
How much farther they would have gone, if any, would be guessing. That it was the same swarm
that started three miles away, appears almost certain; the direction was the same as seen by
all, until they were stopped; the time in the day also exactly corresponded.

We will now return to the issuing of the swarms. There will be some emergencies to provide
for, and some exceptions to notice.

TWO OR MORE SWARMS LIABLE TO UNITE.

If we expect to keep many stocks, the chances are that two or more may issue at one time; and
when they do, they nearly always cluster together (I once knew an instance where only three
stocks were kept; they all swarmed and clustered together). It is plain that the greater the
number of stocks, the more such chances are multiplied.

DISADVANTAGE.

One first swarm, if of the usual size, will contain bees enough for profit, yet two such will
work together without quarrelling, and will store about one-third more than either would alone;
that is, if each single swarm would get 50 lbs., the two together would not get over 70 lbs.,
perhaps less. Here, then, is a loss of 30 lbs., besides one of the swarms is about lost for
another year; because such double swarms are not generally any better the next spring as a
stock, and often not as good as a single one. You will therefore see the advantage of keeping
the first swarms separate.

CAN OFTEN BE PREVENTED.

"Prevention is better than cure." We can, if we keep a good lookout, often prevent more than
one issuing at a time. This depends on our knowledge of indications, in a great measure. I
have said that before starting to fly off, they were about the entrance in great numbers; there
may be one exception in twenty, where the first indications will be a column of bees rushing
from the hive. To take this matter a little farther from the surface, we will take a peep at
the interior; that is, if our hives contain glass boxes, such as have been recommended. It
is an advantage to know which are about to cast their swarms, as long beforehand as possible.

INDICATIONS OF SWARMING INSIDE THE HIVE.

These glass boxes are usually filled with bees; before leaving they may be seen in commotion,
long before any unusual stir is visible outside, sometimes for near an hour. The same may be
noticed in a glass hive. Now, in good weather, when we have reason to expect many swarms, it
is our duty to watch closely, especially when the weather has been unfavorable for several
days previous. A number of stocks may have finished their queen-cells during the bad weather,
and be ready to come out within the first hour of sunshine that occurs in the middle of the
day. We must expect some such occurrences, and in large apiaries there is apt to be trouble,
unless you take some precautions. If you have taken no care (which but few will), by previous
examinations, to know which are ready, as soon as one has started or commenced flying, look
at all the rest that are in condition to swarm; or, what is much better, look before any have
started. Even if nothing unusual is seen about the entrance, raise the cover to the boxes.
If the bees in them are all quiet as usual, no swarm need be immediately apprehended, and you
will probably have time to hive one or two first.

PREVENTING A SWARM ISSUING FOR A TIME.

But should you discover the bees running to and fro in great commotion, although there may
be but few about the entrance, you should lose no time in sprinkling those outside with water
from a watering-pot, or other means. They will immediately enter the hive to avoid the supposed
shower. In half an hour they will be ready to start again, in which time the others may be
secured. I have had, in one apiary, twelve hives all ready in one day, and did actually swarm;
several of which would have started at once, had they not been kept back with water, allowing
only one at a time, thus keeping them separate. They had been kept back by the clouds, which
broke away about noon.

TO PREVENT SWARMS UNITING WITH THOSE ALREADY HIVED.

When any of the subsequent swarms were disposed to unite with those already hived, a sheet
was thrown over to keep them out. I had four so covered at once. An assistant, in such cases,
is very important; one can watch symptoms and keep them back, while the other hives the swarms.

Occasionally, when ready for a swarm and waiting for one to start, two may do so at once. Whenever
a part have got on the wing, I never succeeded in stopping the issue: consequently I have found
it useless trying to drive or coax them back in such cases. To succeed, the means must be used
in season, before any of the swarm leaves.

WHEN TWO HAVE UNITED, THE METHOD OF SEPARATING.

Two or more swarms will cluster together, and not quarrel, if put in one hive; I have already
told you the disadvantages. Unless business is very urgent, your time cannot be better employed
than in dividing them. First, it is necessary to provide a good stock of patience, as it may
be a short job, or it may be a long one. Get two empty hives, and divide the bees as nearly
equal as possible. It is generally the best way to spread a sheet on the ground, and shake
the bees in the centre, and set the hives each side of the mass, their edges raised to allow
the bees to enter; if too many are disposed to enter one hive, set it farther off. If they
cluster in a situation where they cannot be got to the earth in a body, they must be dipped
off as before directed, but, in this case, putting a dipper full in each hive alternately,
until all are in. They should be made to hurry some in going in; keep the entrance clear, and
stir them up often; or sprinkle a very little water on them, as they should not be allowed
to stop their humming until all are in. We have one chance in two of getting a queen in each.
The two hives should now be placed twenty feet apart; if there is a queen in each, the bees
in both will remain quiet, and the work is done; but if not, the bees in the one destitute
will soon manifest it by running about in all directions, and, when the queen cannot be found,
will leave for the other hive, where there are probably two, a few going at a time. Now there
are two or three methods of separating these queens; one is, to empty the bees out and proceed
as before, a kind of chance game, that may succeed at the next trial, and may have to be repeated.
Another way is, that, as soon as it is ascertained which is without a queen, before many bees
leave, spread down a sheet; set this hive on it, and tie the corners over the top to secure
the bees for the present, turn the hive on its side for the present to give them air; or it
may be let down on a wire cloth bottom-board and the hole in the side stopped, and this would
be less likely to smother the bees, if it could be secured to the bottom, and have the hive
lie on its side; when this division is secured, get another hive, and jar out those with the
queens; let them enter as before, and then set them apart, &c., watching the result; if the
queens are not yet separate, it will be known by the same appearances. The process must be
continued till separate, or the number with the queens may be easily looked over, and one of
them found; indeed, a sharp lookout should be kept up from the beginning, and the queens caught,
if possible.

NO DANGER OF A STING BY THE QUEEN.

No danger of her sting need be apprehended, as she will not demean herself to use that for
a common foe; she must have a royal antagonist. When successful in obtaining one, it is sufficient;
put her in a tumbler or some safe place; then put your bees in two hives, place them as directed,
and you will soon learn where your queen is needed. After all is done, the two hives should
not be nearer than twenty feet, at least the first day; perhaps forty would be still better.
When two swarms are mixed, and then separated, it is evident that a portion of each swarm must
be in both hives. A queen in each must of course be a stranger to at least a part of the bees;
these might, if their own mother was too near, discover her, and leave the stranger for an
old acquaintance, and, in the act of going, call or attract the whole with them, including
the queen. I have known a few instances of the kind.

SOME PRECAUTIONS IN HIVING TWO SWARMS TOGETHER.

If you are disposed to separate them, but are afraid to work among them to this extent in the
middle of the day, or if there is danger of more issuing, to mix with them, and add to your
perplexity, of which you already have enough, then you can hive them as a single swarm; but,
instead of a bottom-board, invert an empty hive and set the one with the swarm on this, and
insert a wedge between them, for ventilation. As many bees are liable to drop down, in this
case the lower hive will catch them, and there is less danger of leaving. Let them remain till
near sunset, when another course may be taken to find a queen, though by that time one is sometimes
killed; yet it is well to know the fact. Take them to some place out of the sun, as a less
number will fly during the operation.

HOW TO FIND QUEEN, WHEN TWO STRANGERS ARE TOGETHER.

First, look into the lower hive for a dead queen, and, if none is found there, look thoroughly,
as far as possible, for a little compact cluster of bees, the size of a hen's egg, that may
be rolled about without separating. Secure this cluster in a tumbler; it is quite sure one
of the queens is a prisoner in the middle;[16] should two be seen, get both. Then divide the
bees, and give the one destitute, a queen; or, if you have two, one to each, as the case may
be. It would be well first to see if the queen was alive, by removing the bees from about her.
But should you find nothing of the kind, spread a sheet on the ground, shake the bees on one
end of it, and set the hive on the other; they will immediately begin a march for the hive.
You may now see the cluster, and may not; but they will spread out in marching, and give a
good chance to see her majesty, when a tumbler is the most convenient thing to set over her.
No matter if a few bees are shut up with her, there is no risk, then, in your eagerness to
get the queen, of taking hold of a worker or two. A piece of window-glass can be slipped under,
and you have her safe, and by this time you will know what is to be done next. This operation
could not well be done in the middle of the day, or in the sun, as too many bees would be flying,
and greatly interfere.

      [16] All stranger queens, introduced into a stock or swarm, are
      secured and detained in this manner by the workers, but whether
      they dispatch them, or this is a means adopted to incite them
      to a deadly conflict, writers do not agree, and I shall not
      attempt a decision, as I never saw the bees voluntarily release a
      queen thus confined. But I have seen queens, when no bees
      interfered, rush together in a fatal rencounter, and one of them
      was soon left a fallen victim of the contest. 'Tis said it
      never happens that both are killed in these battles,--perhaps
      not. As I never saw quite all of these royal combats, of course
      I cannot decide.

Should you fail in finding a queen, and cannot succeed in making a division in consequence,
or should you resolve, from want of time, patience or energy, to let them remain together in
the beginning, it is unnecessary to get a hive any larger than usual for two swarms; they will
certainly find room by cold weather: if more than two, they should be divided by all means;
it will be a disadvantage for another year. For the first four days, when two large swarms
are together, it is necessary to keep an inverted hive under them, but much longer it would
not do, as they might extend their combs into the lower hive.

BOXES FOR DOUBLE SWARMS IMMEDIATELY.

It should then be taken out, and boxes immediately put on, which should be changed for empty
ones, as fast as they are filled. Yet, this extra honey is not quite as much advantage as increase
of stocks; when that is an object, I will recommend another disposition.

RETURNING A PART TO THE OLD STOCK.

Separate one-third or more of the two swarms, being sure there is no queen with this part,
(by the test given of setting them at a distance) and then return them to one of the old stocks;
they will immediately enter without contention, and issue again in about nine days, or as soon
as a young queen is matured to go with them. There may be an exception to this, of one in twenty.
I would have recommended this course in all cases of the kind, but there will be a loss of
time for the bees in the old stock; because they are apt to be rather idle, even when they
might labor in the boxes; and here there is a loss of some eight or ten days. The collections
of a good swarm may be estimated at least one pound a day, (often two or three.) A swarm that
just fills the hive, would make at least ten pounds box-honey, if it could have been located
ten days earlier. Still another method may be adopted when you have a very small swarm, one
that is not likely to fill the hive, and has not been hived more than two or three days. A
third of your two swarms may be put in with that; taking care, as before, not to let your only
queen go with them.

METHOD OF UNITING.

The manner of doing it is very simple; get them in a hive as before directed, and jar them
out in front of the one you wish them to enter, or invert it, setting the other over, and let
them run up.

WHEN CARE IS NECESSARY.

Except on the day of swarming, care is necessary not to introduce a small number with a large
swarm; they are liable to be destroyed. The danger is much greater than to put together about
an equal number, or a large number put in with a few. The day that swarms issue, they will
generally mix peaceably, but in proportion as time intervenes between the issues, so will be
the liability to quarrel. Yet, I have united two families of about equal numbers in the fall
and spring, and, with a few exceptions, have had no difficulty.

SWARM-CATCHER.

There is another method of keeping swarms separate, contrived and used by a Mr. Loucks, of
Herkimer Co., N.Y. He calls it a swarm-catcher; he has a half dozen of them, and says he would
not do without for one season, for fifty dollars, as he has a large apiary. I made one as near
as I could from seeing his, without taking the exact measure. I got out four light posts four
and half feet long, one inch square; then twelve pieces of one-quarter inch stuff, four inches
wide; the four for the top twelve inches long, for the bottom two were fourteen inches long,
and two were twenty. These were thoroughly nailed on the ends of the posts, making it into
an upright frame, the other four pieces were nailed around the middle, which made the frame
firmer. I made a frame for the top, of four pieces, each an inch and a half in width, and half
inch thick, halved at the ends and nailed together, and fastened by hinges to one side of the
top, and a catch to hold it shut. The whole was now covered with very thin cloth to admit the
light, but not so open as to let the bees through, (Mr. Loucks used cloth made for cheese-strainers.)
I now had a covered frame four and half feet high, 12 inches square at the top, at the bottom
14 by 20, with a door or lid at the top, to let out the bees. On each side of the bottom I
tacked a piece of common muslin, near a yard in length. When a swarm is ready to issue, the
bottom of this frame is set up before the hive, one edge of the bottom rests on the bottom-board,
the other against the side of the hive; the top sets off from the hive at an angle of about
45 degrees, under which a brace is set to hold it. The muslin at the bottom is to wrap around
the hive at the side to prevent the escape of the bees. The swarm rushes into this without
any hesitation.

When done coming out, the muslin at the bottom is drawn over it, and the frame is set in an
upright position, and allowed to stand a few minutes for the bees to get quiet in the top.
It is now to be laid on its side, the door opened, and the bees hived. In the few trials that
I have given it, I succeeded without difficulty. But I would remark, that stocks from which
swarms are caught in this way, must not be raised at the back side, as a part of the swarm
would issue there, and not get into the net. Mr. Loucks had his hive directly on the board;
and he told me he kept them so through the season: the only places of entrance was a sprout
out of the bottom of the front side, about three inches wide by half inch deep, and a hole
in the side a few inches up. You will thus perceive that stocks from which swarms are hived
in this way must be prepared for it previously. Also, it will be no use to such bee-keepers
as depend on seeing their swarms in the air. It will be beneficial only in large apiaries,
where several swarms are liable to issue at once; the swarming indications well understood,
and the apiarian on the lookout.

SWARMS SOMETIMES RETURN.

Occasionally a swarm will issue, and in a few minutes return to the old stock. Mr. Miner gives
a cause for this, very ingenious, and romantic, but unfortunately there are but few facts to
sustain this hypothesis, (at least I have not discovered them.) There are other causes that
appear to me more reasonable; the most common is the inability of the old queen to fly, on
account of her burden of eggs, old age, or something else. I have sometimes, after the swarm
had returned found the queen near the stock, and put her back, and the next day she would come
out again, and fly without difficulty, (perhaps she had discharged some of her eggs.)

Their returning is more frequent in windy weather, or when the sun is partially obscured by
clouds. About three-fourths of them will not re-issue until a young queen is matured, eight
or ten days afterwards; and a few, not at all. But when the queen returns with the swarm, they
usually come out again the next day, or day after, and some not till the third or fourth. I
have known two instances where they issued again the same day.

REPETITION PREVENTED.

Sometimes a swarm will issue and return three or four days in succession, but this I generally
remedy, as it is often owing to some inability of the queen, and she may be frequently found
while the swarm is leaving outside the hive, unable to fly. In such cases it is only necessary
to have a tumbler ready, and watch for her; and as soon as she appears, secure her, get the
empty hive for the swarm, a sheet, and put down a bottom-board a few feet from the stock. The
swarm is sure to come back; the first bees that alight on the hive will set up the call; as
soon as this is perceived, lose no time in setting the old stock on the board, and throwing
the sheet over it to keep out the bees. Put the new one in its place on the stand, and the
queen in it; in a few minutes the swarm will be in the new hive, when it can be removed, and
the old one replaced. This I have done many times. But should the swarm begin to cluster in
a convenient place, when you have so caught the queen, by being expeditious she may be put
with the swarm, before they have missed her and may be hived in the usual way.

LIABILITY TO ENTER WRONG STOCKS.

In all cases, whether you set a new hive in place of the old one or not, whenever a swarm returns,
if other stocks stand close on each side, they are quite sure to receive a portion of the bees--probably
a few hundreds; these are certain to be massacred. To prevent which, it is necessary to throw
sheets over them until the swarm has gathered on their own hive. This is another reason for
plenty of room between stocks. Should no queen be discovered during their issue, or return,
she should be sought for in the vicinity of the hive, and put back if found, and the swarm
will be likely to issue several days earlier, than to wait for a young queen.

When the old queen is actually lost, and the bees have returned to wait for a young one, it
is often ready to leave one or two days short of the time required for second swarms. Whether
a greater number of bees in the old stock creating more animal heat, matures the chrysalis
in less time than a stock thinned by casting a swarm, or some other cause, I cannot say. I
mention it because I have known it to occur frequently, but not invariably. A swarm flying,
unaccompanied by a queen, is scattered more than usual.

FIRST ISSUES GENERALLY CHOOSE FAIR WEATHER.

First swarms are commonly more particular as to weather than after swarms. They have several
days from which to choose, after these royal cells are ready, and before the queens are matured;
and they usually take a fair one. But here again are exceptions. I once had two first swarms
issue in a wind that kept every branch of tree and bush in agitation to such a degree that
it was impossible to find any such place to cluster. I expected their return to the old hive;
but here were more exceptions. After repeating a fruitless attempt at the branches, they gave
it up, and came down amongst the grass on "terra firma." This occurred after several days of
rainy weather. The next day being pleasant, twelve issued; almost proving that the wind the
preceding day kept back a part. I also knew one to issue in a shower, that beat many of them
to the ground before they could cluster. In this case the shower was sudden, the sun shone
almost up to the time it began to rain. About this time the swarm started when it seemed they
were unwilling to turn about.

AFTER SWARMS.

After swarms are second and third issues (or all after the first) from a stock; and quite a
different affair from the first, as also are some first swarms, when the old queen has been
lost, being led out by young queens.

THEIR SIZE.

Second swarms are usually half as large as the first, the third half as large as the second,
the fourth still less; with some variations. I give general features, noticing only the exceptions
that occur most frequently; others sometimes happen, but so seldom that mentioning them is
deemed unnecessary.

TIME AFTER THE FIRST.

Whenever the first swarm in a prosperous season was not kept back by foul weather, the first
of the young queens in the old stock is ready to emerge in about eight days. We will suppose
the first swarm issued on Sunday; a week from the next Tuesday will be usually as soon as the
second one need be expected.

PIPING OF THE QUEEN.

On the Monday evening previous, or on Tuesday morning, by putting your ear close to the hive,
and listening attentively five minutes, you will hear a distinct piping noise, like the word
peep, peep, uttered several times in succession, and then an interval of silence; two or more
may be often heard at the same time; that of one will be shrill and fine, of another hoarse,
short and quick. This piping is easily heard by any one not actually deaf, and not the least
danger of its being taken for any humming; in fact, it is not to be mistaken for anything else
but piping, even when you hear it for the first time. These notes can probably never be heard
except when the hive contains a plurality of queens.

MAY ALWAYS BE HEARD BEFORE AND AFTER SWARM.

I never failed to hear it, previous to a second swarm, or any after the first, whenever I listened;
and whenever I have listened and not heard it at the proper time, I never knew a second swarm
to issue!

TIME OF CONTINUANCE VARIES.

The time of commencing will be later than this rule in some stocks, if the weather is cool,
or not many bees left; it may be ten or twelve days. I once found it fourteen before I heard
it. Also the swarm may not issue in two or three days after you hear it. The longer the swarm
delays, the louder will be the piping; I have heard it distinctly twenty feet, by listening
attentively when I knew one was thus engaged; but at first it is rather faint. By putting your
ear against the hive it may be heard even in the middle of the day, or at any time before issuing.
The length of time it may be heard beforehand seems to be governed again by the yield of honey;
when abundant it is common for them to issue the next day; but when somewhat scarce, they will
be much longer--very often three or four days. In these cases third swarms seldom occur.

TIME BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD ISSUES.

Piping for third swarms (when they issue) may usually be heard the evening after the second
has left, though one day commonly intervenes between their issues.

Here my experience is at variance with many writers, who give several days between the second
and third. I do not recollect an instance of more than three days between, but many in less,
several the next, and one the same day of the second! I had an instance of a swarm losing its
queen (the old one) on its first sally, and returned to wait for the young ones; when they
were ready, an uncommon number of bees were present; three swarms issued in three days! On
the fourth, another came out and returned; the fifth day it left; making four regular swarms
in five days. On the eighth, the fifth swarm left! Although I never had five swarms from a
stock before, yet I expected this, from the fact of hearing the piping on the next evening
after the fourth one had left. The piping had continued in this hive from the evening previous
to the first swarm till the last one had left.

NOT ALWAYS TO BE DEPENDED UPON.

One stock in fifteen may commence piping, yet send out no swarm. The bees will change their
minds about coming out, and kill their queens, or allow the eldest one of them to destroy the
others, or some other way, as they do not always swarm in such circumstances. But when the
piping continues over twenty-four hours, I never knew but one failure! I have known a few (two
or three) to commence this piping, while I supposed the old queen was yet present, and had
not left the hive, on account of bad weather, but a swarm issued soon after. Also, three instances
where I supposed the old queen lost, from some other cause than leading out a swarm, and the
stock reared some young ones to supply her place. It occurred in or near the swarming season,
and one or two issues was the consequence. One case was three weeks in advance of the season,
and the swarm was about half the usual size. When a swarm has been out, and returned at the
last of the swarming season, it is much more probable to re-issue, than if it depended on an
old queen for a leader, that had not been out. Such will sometimes be a week or ten days later
than others. Once I had the first swarm kept back by wet weather, and the second came out on
the fifth day after; several other instances on the seventh and eighth; and one as late as
the sixteenth, after the first.

A RULE FOR THE TIME OF THESE ISSUES.

This may be put down as a rule, that all after swarms must be out by the eighteenth day from
the first. I never found an exception, unless the following may be considered so: When a swarm
left the middle of May, and another the first of July, seven weeks after, but two cases of
this kind have come up, and these I consider rather in the light of first swarms, as they leave
under the same circumstances, leaving the combs in the old stock filled with brood, queen-cells
finished, &c. A stock may cast swarms in June, and a buckwheat swarm in August, on the same
principle.

WHEN IT IS USELESS TO EXPECT MORE SWARMS.

Therefore, bee-keepers having but few stocks, will find it unnecessary to watch their bees
when the last of the first swarms came out sixteen or eighteen days before. Much trouble may
be thus saved by understanding this matter. During my early days in beekeeping, I wished for
the greatest possible increase of stocks. I had some that had cast the first swarm, and soon
after clustered out again. I vainly watched them for weeks and months, expecting another swarm.
But had I understood the modus operandi, as the reader may now understand it, I should have
been through with all my anxiety, as well as watching, in a fortnight. As it was, it lasted
two months. I found no one to give me any light on this subject, or even tell me when the swarming
season was over, and I came very near watching all summer!

PLURALITY OF QUEENS DESTROYED.

When the bees, queens, or all together, decide that no more swarms are to issue, the plurality
of queens is destroyed, and but one is left. It is probable that the oldest and strongest queen
dispatches the others, generally while in the cells.

I once had some artificial queens reared, as an experiment, from common eggs, on the top of
a hive, in a small glass box, where there was room for but one comb, which allowed me to see
all particulars.

THE MANNER.

After the first queen was matured, and had left her cell, I caught her within six hours, taking
advantage of her younger sisters, which were yet sealed up, and of course could offer no resistance.
She first made an opening that would allow her to reach the abdomen of her competitor (probably
this is the most vulnerable). As soon as this was sufficiently large to admit her body, she
thrust it in, inflicting the fatal sting. This was then left for another, that soon shared
the same fate. If quick and spiteful movements are any indications of hatred, it was manifested
here very plainly. The bees enlarged the orifice and dragged out the now dead queens.

Now, if I should say that all queens were dispatched in this way, merely because I witnessed
it in this case, it would be carrying out the principle I am endeavoring to avoid: that is,
judging all cases from one or two solitary facts. As it is, it is somewhat confirmatory of
what some others have said. I will suppose, then, until further evidence contradicts it, that
the first perfect queen leaving her cell, makes it her business to destroy all rivals in their
cradle, as soon as it is decided that no more swarms shall issue. By keeping grass, weeds,
&c., away from about the stock, these dead queens, as they are brought out, may be frequently
found. Such as are removed during the night may be often found on the floor-board in the morning.
I have found a dozen by one stock. Should the stock send out but one swarm, they may be found
about the time, or a little before you would listen for the piping. But should after swarms
come out, they will, or may be found the next morning after it is decided that no more are
to issue. It is very seldom that all the queens reared are needed. They make it a rule, as
far as they have control, to go on safe principles, by having a little more than just enough.
When several such bodies are thrown out, and no piping is heard, no further swarming need be
expected. But should you hear the piping a day or two after finding a dead queen, you may yet
look for the swarm.

THEORY DOUBTED.

It is stated that when the bees decide an after swarm shall issue, the first queen matured
is not allowed to leave her cell, but kept a prisoner there, and fed until wanted to go forth
with the swarm. This may be true in some cases (though not satisfactorily proved), but I am
quite sure it is not in all.

When she is confined to her cell, how does she ascertain the presence of others? By leaving
the cell, this knowledge is easily obtained. Huber says she does, and is "enraged at the existence
of others, and endeavors to destroy them while yet in the cell, which the workers will not
allow; this is so irritating to her majesty that she utters this peculiar sound." Also second
and third swarms may contain several queens, frequently two, three, and four; even six at one
time come out. If these had to bite their way out, after the workers had decided it was time
to start (for it must be they decide it when the queens are shut up), they would hardly be
in season.

AFTER SWARMS DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE FROM THE FIRST WHEN ABOUT TO ISSUE.

Another thing, when after swarms start, the appearance about the entrance is altogether different
from first ones, unless there is an unusual number of bees. I have said that for a little time
beforehand, that such were in an apparent tumult, &c. But after swarms seldom give any such
notice. One or more of the young queens may sometimes be seen to run out, and back, several
times in a few minutes, in a perfect frenzy; sometimes fly a short distance, and return before
the swarm will get started (which she could not do if confined). The workers seem more reluctant
about leaving than in first swarms, when a mother instead of a sister is leader. Even after
the swarm is in motion, she may return and enter the hive a moment. No doubt she finds it necessary
to animate or induce as many as possible to leave with her. A person watching the issue of
a second swarm under these circumstances, for the first time, and finding the queen leaving
first, would very likely guess all must be alike. Perhaps the next one would be different;
the first thing seen might be the swarm leaving, and no queen discovered at all. But to return
to the imprisonment of the queens. I have one other fact in objection. I once saw a queen running
about in a glass hive, while they were piping for a second swarm. She was near the glass, appeared
agitated, stopping occasionally to vibrate her wings, which was simultaneous with the piping,
and seemed to make it. The workers appeared to take but little notice of her. The next day
the swarm left. Here was one instance, at least, of her not being confined till the time of
leaving, making an exception, if not a rule. Let this matter be as it may, I admit it makes
but little difference to the practical apiarian, either way; but to the reader whose interest
is the natural history of the bee, the truth is important.

TIME OF DAY, WEATHER, ETC.

These after swarms are not very particular about the weather; heavy winds, a few clouds, and
sometimes a slight sprinkling of rain, will not always deter them. Neither are they very precise
about the time of day. I have known them in a warm morning to issue before seven o'clock, and
after five P.M. These things should be understood; because, when after swarms are expected
(of which the piping will give warning), it is necessary to watch them in weather, and at times
when first ones would not venture to leave.

SWARMS NECESSARY TO BE SEEN.

It is essential that you see them, that you may know where they cluster, otherwise it might
be difficult to find them. They are apt to go farther from the parent stock than others; sometimes
fifty rods, and then settle in two places, perhaps that distance apart, in some high or inconvenient
place to get at. (Let me not be misunderstood: I do not say they all do so, or even the majority;
but I wish to say that a greater portion of these swarms do so than of the first.) If they
cluster in two places, a queen may be in each, and they will remain, and when you have hived
one part you may think you have all. If one cluster is without a queen, they will join the
other if near; but when distant, will be very likely to return to the old stock soon, unless
put together. I had a swarm light in two places, in exactly opposite directions from the stock.
In one, a good swarm had clustered; in the other, some less than a pint. The small part had
one or more queens, the other none. It was perceived at once by their movements. Now, if we
provide a hive for a swarm, and get a few to set up the call or buzzing, they will not leave
till that is stopped. There is generally no difficulty to start it. The surest way is to jar
a portion or all directly into the hive. It takes a few minutes to get composed, and miss the
queen. In my case I got them in the hive, and before they missed the queen, carried them to
the small cluster, which I got in a dipper and emptied in front of the hive; they entered,
and all were peaceable. You will therefore see the necessity of watching such swarms, to see
if there is no separation, if nothing else.

RETURNING AFTER SWARMS TO THE OLD STOCK.

Much has been said about returning all after swarms to the old stock; the advantages of which
will depend on the time of issuing; whether late or early, the yield of honey, etc. It would
be unusual to have many after swarms without a liberal yield of honey, for the time being;
but to tell of its continuance is the question to be answered. Second, and even third swarms,
if early in the season, and the honey continues plentiful, may be hived, and these, together
with the old stock, will prosper. Here the apiarian needs a little judgment and experience
to guide him.

WHEN THEY SHOULD BE RETURNED.

It is always best, if possible, to have good strong families. When after swarms are late it
is safest to return them, as the old stock will need them to replenish the hive, and prepare
for winter. Also a less number of worms will infest it, when well provided with bees; and the
chances of box honey are greater.

METHOD OF DOING IT.

But the process of returning such requires some little patience and perseverance. I have said
there may be a dozen young queens in the old stock. Now suppose one, two, or more leave with
the swarm, and you return the whole together, there is nothing to prevent their leading out
the swarm again the next day. Therefore it is policy to keep the queens back. The least trouble
is to hive in the usual way, and let them stand till the next morning. It will save you the
trouble of looking for more than one, if there should be more, for all but that are destroyed
by that time. There is a chance, also, for the old stock to decide that no more should issue,
and allow all but one to be slain there. When this is the case, and you find the one with the
swarm, you will have no further trouble by their re-issuing. They should be returned as soon
as the next morning, otherwise they might not agree, even when put in the old home. To return
them, and find a queen easily, get a wide board a few feet long; let one end rest on the ground,
the other near the entrance, that they may enter the hive without flying; then shake out the
swarm on the lower end of the board; but few will fly, but soon commence running up towards
the hive; the first one that discovers the entrance will set up the call for the others. If
they do not discover it, which is the case sometimes, scatter some of them near it, and they
will soon commence marching up, when you should look out for, and secure the queen, as they
spread and give a good chance. By applying your ear to the hive, the piping will tell you if
they are to issue again. It is evident, if you follow these directions, that the swarm cannot
issue many times before their stock of royalty will be exhausted; and when but one queen remains
the piping will cease, and no further trouble will be had. To prevent these after swarms, some
writers recommend turning over the hive and cutting out all the royal cells but one. This I
have found impracticable with a great many stocks. Some of the cells are too near the top to
be seen, consequently this cannot always be depended upon. As for a rule about returning, it
is somewhat difficult to give one. If I should say, return all such as issue after the 20th
of June, the variation in the season might be two or three weeks, even in the same latitude;
i.e., the course of flowers that had bloomed by that date in one season might, another year,
require two weeks more to bring out. Also, the 20th of June, in latitude of New York City,
is as late as the 4th of July in many places further north. I once had a second swarm on the
11th of July, that wintered well, having nearly filled the hive. Yet, in some seasons, the
first swarms, of the last of June, have failed to get enough. In sections where much buckwheat
is raised, late swarms do more towards filling their hives than where there is none.

MORE CARE NEEDED BY AFTER SWARMS WHEN HIVED.

Should it be thought best to hive after swarms, and risk the chances, they should receive a
little extra attention after the first week or two, to destroy the worms; a little timely care
may prevent considerable injury. They are apt to construct more combs in proportion to the
number of bees, than others; consequently, such combs cannot be properly covered and protected.
The moth has an opportunity to deposit her eggs on them, and, sometimes, entirely destroy them.

TWO MAY BE UNITED.

Whenever these swarms issue near enough together, it is best to unite them. I have said second
swarms were generally half as large as the first. By this rule, two second swarms would contain
as many bees as a first one, and four of the third, or one of the second issue, and two of
the third, &c. If the first and second are of the ordinary size, I think it advisable always
to return the third. But in large apiaries it is common for them to issue without any previous
warning, just when a first one is leaving, and crowd themselves into their company, and seeming
to be as much at home as though they were equally respectable.

Whenever the hives containing our swarms are full or very near it, the boxes should be put
on without delay, unless the season of honey is so nearly gone as to make it unnecessary.

I have found it an advantage to hive a few of these very small swarms, on purpose to preserve
queens, to supply some old stocks that sometimes lose their own at the extreme end of the swarming
season. The cases to be mentioned at the last of the next chapter. I try and save one for about
every twenty stocks that have swarmed.

CHAPTER XIV.

LOSS OF QUEENS.

OF SWARMS THAT LOSE THEIR QUEEN.

Swarms that lose their queen the first few hours after being hived, generally return to the
parent stock; with the exception that they sometimes unite with some other. If much time has
elapsed before the loss, they remain, unless standing on the same bench with another. On a
separate stand they continue their labor, but a large swarm diminishes rapidly, and seldom
fills an ordinary-sized hive. One singular circumstance attends a swarm that is constructing
combs without a queen. I have never seen it noticed by any one, and may not always be the case,
but every instance that has come under my notice, I have so found it. That is, four-fifths
of the combs are drone-cells; why they thus construct them is another subject for speculation,
from which I will endeavor in this instance to refrain.

A SUGGESTION AND AN ANSWER.

It has been suggested as a profitable speculation, "to hive a large swarm without a queen,
and give them a piece of brood-comb containing eggs, to rear one, and then as soon as it is
matured, deprive them of it, giving them another piece of comb, and continue it throughout
the summer, putting on boxes for surplus honey. The bees having no young brood to consume any
honey, no time will be lost, or taken to nurse them, and as a consequence they will be enabled
to store large quantities of surplus honey."

This appears very plausible, and to a person without experience somewhat conclusive. If success
depended on some animal whose lease of life was a little longer, it would answer better to
calculate in this way. But as a bee seldom sees the anniversary of its birthday, and most of
them perish the first few months of their existence, it is bad economy. It will be found that
the largest amount of our surplus honey is obtained from our prolific stocks. Therefore it
is all-important that every swarm and stock has a queen to repair this constant loss.

A DISPUTED QUESTION.

We now approach another disputed point in natural history, relative to the queen leaving at
any time except when leading out a swarm. Most writers say that the young queen leaves the
hive, and meets her paramour, the drone, on the wing. Others deny this positively, having watched
a whole summer without seeing her highness leave. Consequently they have arrived at the very
plausible and apparently consistent conclusion, that nature never intended it to be so, since
it must happen at a time when the existence of the whole family depends entirely on the life
of the queen. The stock at such times contains no eggs or larvæ, from which to rear another,
if she should be lost. "The chances at such times of being devoured by birds, blown away by
the winds, and other casualties, are too many, and it is not probable the Creator would have
so arranged it." But facts are stubborn things; they will not yield one jot to favor the most
"finely-spun hypothesis;" they are most provokingly obstinate, many times. When man, without
the necessary observation, takes a survey through animated nature, and finds with scarcely
an exception that male and female are about equal in number, he is ready, and often does conclude
that one bee among thousands cannot be the only one capable of reproduction or depositing eggs.
Why, the idea is preposterous! And yet only a little observation will upset this very consistent
and analogous reasoning. So it appears to be with the excursions of the young queens. I was
compelled, though reluctantly, to admit that they leave the hive. That their purpose is to
meet the drones, I cannot at present contradict. Also, that, when the queen is once impregnated,
it is operative for life, (yet it is another anomaly), as I never detected her coming out again
for that purpose. What then is the use of the ten thousand drones that never fulfil this important
duty? It seems, indeed, like a useless waste of labor and honey, for each stock to rear some
twelve or fifteen hundred, when perhaps but one, sometimes not any of the whole number is of
any use. If the risk is great in the queen's leaving, we find it arranged admirably in its
not being too frequent.

A MULTITUDE OF DRONES NEEDED.

Instinct teaches the bee to make the matters left to them as nearly sure as possible. When
they want one queen, they raise half a dozen. If one drone or only half a dozen were reared,
the chances of the queen meeting one in the air would be very much reduced. But when a thousand
are in the air instead of one, the chances are a thousand times multiplied. If a stock casts
a swarm, there is a young queen to be impregnated, and be got safely back, or the stock is
lost. Every time she leaves, there is a chance of her being lost, (one in fifteen). If the
number of drones was any less than it is, the queen would have to repeat her excursions in
proportion, before successful. As it is, some have to leave several times. The chances and
consequences are so great, that on the whole no doubt but it is better to rear a thousand unnecessarily,
than to lack one just in time of need. Therefore let us endeavor to be content with the present
arrangement, inasmuch as we could not better it, and probably had we been consulted, would
have so fixed "the thing, that it would not go at all."

But what is the use of the drones in hives that do not swarm, and do not intend it, situated
in a large room or very large hives? Such circumstances seldom produce swarms, yet as regular
as the return of summer, a brood of drones appear. What are they for? Suppose the old queen
in such hive dies, leaving eggs or young larvæ, and a young queen is reared to supply her place.
How is she to be impregnated without the drones? Perhaps they are taught that whenever they
can afford it, they should have some on hand to be ready for an emergency. I have already said
when bees are numerous, and honey abundant, they never fail to provide them. I once put a swarm
in a glass hive. The queen was a cripple, having lost one of her posterior legs; in two months
after she was replaced by one young and perfect. Here was an instance of drones being needed,
when no intention of swarming was indicated; the hive was but little more than half full.

THE QUEEN LIABLE TO BE LOST IN HER EXCURSIONS.

This excursion of the queen, whenever I have witnessed it, always took place a little after
the middle of the day, when the drones were out in the greatest numbers. At such times I have
seen them leave amid rather more commotion than usual among the workers. I have watched their
return, which varied from three minutes to half an hour, and seen them hover around their own
hive, apparently in doubt whether they belonged in that, or the next; in a few instances they
have actually settled on the neighboring hive, and would have there perished, but for my assistance
in putting them right.

THE TIME WHEN IT OCCURS.

Thus we see that queens are lost on these occasions from some cause, and part of them by entering
the wrong hive, perhaps most of them; if so, it is another good reason for not packing stocks
too close. The hives are very often nearly alike in color and appearance. The queen coming
out for the first time in her life, is no doubt confused by this similarity.

The number of such losses in a season has varied: one year the average was one in nine, another
it was one in thirteen, and another one in twenty. The time from the first swarm also varies
from twelve to twenty days. The inexperienced reader should not forget that it is the old stocks
which have cast swarms, where these accidents happen; the old queen having left with the first
swarm. Also all after swarms are liable to the same loss. I would suggest that these have abundant
room given between the hives; if it is necessary to pack close, let it be the first swarms,
where the old queen has no occasion to leave. Having never seen this matter fully discussed,
I wish to be somewhat particular, and flatter myself that I shall be able to direct the careful
apiarian how to save a few stocks and swarms annually, that is, if he keeps many. A few years
ago, I wrote an article for the Albany Cultivator. A subscriber of that paper told me a year
afterwards that he saved two stocks the next summer by the information; they were worth at
least five dollars each, enough to pay for his paper ten years or more.

When a stock casts but one swarm, the queen having no competitors to interfere with her movements,
will leave in about fourteen days, if the weather is fair; but should an after swarm leave,
the oldest of the young queens will probably go with that, of course: then, it must be later
before the next is ready: it may be twenty days, or even more; those with after swarms will
vary from one to six. It always must occur when no eggs or larvæ exist, and no means left to
repair this loss; a loss it is, and a serious one; the bees are in as much trouble as their
owner, and a great deal more, they seeming to understand the consequences, and he, if he knows
nothing of the matter, has no trouble. Should he now, for the first time, learn the nature
of it, he will at the same time understand the remedy.

INDICATIONS OF THE LOSS.

The next morning after a loss of this kind has occurred, and occasionally at evening, the bees
may be seen running about in the greatest consternation, outside, to and fro on the sides.
Some will fly off a short distance and return; one will run to another, and then to another,
still in hopes, no doubt, of finding their lost sovereign! A neighboring hive close by, on
the same bench, will probably receive a portion, which will seldom resist an accession under
such circumstances. All this will be going on while other hives are quiet. Towards the middle
of the day, this confusion will be less marked; but the next morning it will be exhibited again,
though not so plainly, and cease after the third, when they become apparently reconciled to
their fate.

They will continue their labors as usual, bringing in pollen and honey. Here I am obliged to
differ with writers who tell us that all labor will now cease. I hope the reader will not be
deceived by supposing that because the bees are bringing in pollen, that they must have a queen;
I can assure you it is not always the case.

THE RESULT.

The number of bees will gradually decrease, and be all gone by the early part of winter, leaving
a good supply of honey, and an extra quantity of bee-bread, as before mentioned, because there
has been no young brood to consume it. This is the case when a large family was left at the
time of the loss. When but few bees are left, it is very different; the combs are unprotected
by a covering of bees; the moth deposits her eggs on them, and the worms soon finish up the
whole. Yet the bees from the other stocks will generally first remove the honey.

AGE OF BEES INDICATED.

Hundreds of bee-keepers lose some of their stocks in this way, and can assign no reasonable
cause. "Why," say they, "there wasn't twenty bees in the hive; it was all full of honey," or
worms, as the case may be. "Only a short time before, it was full of bees; I got three good
swarms from it, and it always had been first rate, but all at once the bees were gone. I don't
understand it!" Such bee-keepers cannot understand how rapidly a family of bees diminish, when
there is no queen to replenish with young this mortality of the old ones. I doubt whether the
largest and best family possibly could be made to exist six months, without a queen for their
renewal, except, perhaps, through the winter.

When standing close on one bench, they are gone sooner than if on separate stands, as they
often join a neighboring hive when they can walk to it.

NECESSITY OF CARE.

As this tumult cannot be seen but a few days at most, it is well--yes, it is necessary--to
make it a duty to glance at the hives at this period after swarming, every morning; a glance
is sufficient to tell you of the fact. Remember to reckon from the date of the first issue;
this occurs when the first royal cells are sealed over, and is the best criterion as to when
the queen will leave. If the first swarm issue and return, it can make no difference; reckon
from their first issuing.

REMEDY.

When you discover a loss, first ascertain if there is any after swarm to be expected from another
stock, (by listening for the piping); if so, wait till it issues, and obtain a queen from that
for your stock; even if there is but one, take it, and let the bees return; they would be likely
to come out again the next day; if not, it is very often no great loss.

Should no such swarm be indicated, go to a stock that has cast a first swarm within a week;
smoke it and turn it over, as before directed, find a royal cell, and with a broad knife cut
it out, being careful not to injure it. This must now be secured in the other hive in its natural
position, the lower end free from any obstacle, that would interfere with the queen leaving
it. It will make but little difference whether at the top or bottom, providing it is secure
from falling.

I generally introduce it through a hole in the top, taking care to find one that will allow
the cell to pass down between two combs. It being largest at the upper end, the combs each
side will sustain it, and leave the lower end free. In a few hours the bees will secure it
permanently to the combs with wax. This operation cannot be performed in a chamber hive, as
it is impossible to see the arrangement of the combs through the holes. To put it in at the
bottom is some more trouble; the difficulty is, to fasten it, and prevent it resting on the
end. I have done it as follows: Get an old thick piece of dry comb some three inches square;
cut out an inch of the middle. At right angles with this, in one edge in the centre, make another
to intersect it, just the size of the cell, and have the lower end reach into the opening.
This comb will keep it in the right position, and may rest on the floor-board. It can now be
put in the hive, cutting out a piece of comb to make room for it if necessary.

Soon after such cell is introduced, the bees are quiet. In a few days it hatches, and they
have a queen as perfect as if it had been one of their own rearing. This queen of course will
be necessitated to leave the hive, and will be just as liable to be lost, but no more so than
others, and must be watched the same. It is unnecessary to look for a cell in a stock that
has cast its first swarm more than a week before, as they are generally destroyed by that time,
(sometimes short of it,) unless they intend to send out an after swarm.

MARK THE DATE OF SWARMS ON THE HIVE.

Should you have so many stocks that you cannot remember the date of each swarm without difficulty,
it is a good plan to mark the date on one side or corner of the hive, as it issues. You can
then tell at once where to look for a cell when wanted.

It will sometimes happen that a queen may be lost at the extreme end of the swarming season,
when no other stock contains such cells. I then look around for the poorest stock or swarm
that I have on hand, one that I can afford to sacrifice, if it possesses a queen, to save the
one that has sustained this loss; this is not often the case, but is sometimes. I have a few
times put just bees enough with the queen to keep her in a box, and kept them for this purpose,
as was mentioned in the last chapter. When introduced, the bees are generally killed, but the
queen is preserved.

OBTAINING A QUEEN FROM WORKER BROOD.

There is yet another method to be adopted, and that is, to obtain a piece of brood-comb containing
workers' eggs, or larvæ very young. You will generally find it without much trouble, in a young
swarm that is making combs; the lower ends usually contain eggs; take a piece from one of the
middle sheets, two or three inches long, (you will probably use smoke by this time without
telling). Invert the hive that is to receive it, put the piece edgewise between the combs,
if you can spread them apart enough for the purpose; they will hold it there, and then there
will be ample room to make the cells. They will nearly always rear several queens. I have counted
nine several times, which were all they had room for. But yet I have very little confidence
in such queens, they are almost certain to be lost.

THEY ARE POOR DEPENDENCE.

Therefore I would recommend getting a royal cell whenever it is practical. There is yet another
advantage; you will have a queen ready to lay eggs two or three weeks earlier, than when they
are compelled to commence with the egg. I have put such piece of brood-comb in a small glass
box on the top of the hive instead of the bottom, because it was less trouble, but in this
case the eggs were all removed in a short time; whether a queen was reared in the hive or not
I cannot say; but this I know, I never obtained a prolific queen, after repeated experiments
in this way.

It would appear that I have been more unfortunate with queens reared in this way, than most
experimenters. I have no difficulty to get them formed to all appearance perfect, but lose
them afterwards. Now whether this arose from some lack of physical development, by taking grubs
too far advanced to make a perfect change, or whether they were reared so late in the season,
that most of the drones were destroyed, and the queen to meet one had to repeat her excursions
till lost, I am yet unable to fully determine. To test the first of these questions, I have
a few times removed all the larvæ from the comb; leaving nothing but eggs, that all the food
given them might be "royal pap," from the commencement, and had no better success so far. Yet
occasionally prolific queens have been reared when I could account for their origin in no other
way but from worker eggs. But you will find they are not to be depended upon generally.

Sometimes, after all our endeavors, a stock or two will remain destitute of a queen. These,
if they escape the worms, will generally store honey enough in this section to winter a good
family. This will have to be introduced, of course, from another hive, containing a queen;
but this belongs to Fall management.

As respects the time that elapses from the impregnation of the queen till the commencement
of egg laying, I cannot tell, but guess it might be about two or three days. I have driven
out the bees twenty-one days after the first swarm, when no second swarm had issued--the young
queen came out on the fourteenth day. I found eggs and some very young larvæ. When it is remembered
that eggs remain three days before they hatch, it shows that the first of these must have been
deposited some four or five days. When writers tell us the exact time to an hour (46 or 48)
from impregnation to laying, I am willing to admit the thing in this case, but feel just as
if I would like to ask how they managed to find out the fact; by what sign they knew when a
queen returned from an excursion, whether she had been successful or not, in her amours; or,
whether another effort would have to be made; and then, how they managed to know exactly when
the first egg was laid.

Occasionally a queen is lost at other than the swarming season, averaging about one in forty.
It is most frequent in spring; at least it is generally discovered then. The queen may die
in the winter, and the bees not give us any indications till they come out in spring. (Occasionally
they may all desert the hive, and join another.) If we expect to ascertain when a queen is
lost at this season, we must notice them just before dark on the first warm days--because the
mornings are apt to be too cool for any bees to be outside--any unusual stir, or commotion,
similar to what has been described, shows the loss. This is the worst time in the year to provide
the remedy, unless there should happen to be some very poor stock containing a queen, that
we might lose any way--then it might be advisable to sacrifice it to save the other, especially
if the last contained all the requisites of a good stock except a queen. Some eight or ten,
that I have managed in this way, have given me full satisfaction. I have at other times let
them go till the swarming season, and then procured a queen, or introduced a small swarm; at
which time they are so reduced as to be worth but little, even when not affected by the worms.
To obviate this loss in this way, it might be an advantage to transfer the bees to the next
stock, if it was not too full already; or the bees of the next stock to this. Let the age and
condition of the combs, quantity of stores, &c., decide.

CHAPTER XV.

ARTIFICIAL SWARMS.

PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD.

Artificial swarms can be made with safety at the proper season. To the bee-keeper who wishes
to increase his stocks, it will be an advantage to understand some of the principles. I have
had some little experience that has led to different conclusions from those of some others.
I have seen it stated, and found the assertion repeated by nearly every writer, that "whenever
bees were deprived of their queen, if they only possessed eggs or young larvæ, they would not
fail to rear another," &c. There are numerous instances of their doing this, but it is not
to be depended upon, especially when left in a hive full of combs, as the following experiments
tend to prove.

SOME EXPERIMENTS.

Several years since I had a few stocks well supplied with bees, and every indication of swarming
present, such as clustering out, &c., but they pertinaciously adhered to the old stock, through
the whole swarming season! Others apparently not as well supplied with bees threw off swarms.
I had but few stocks, and was very anxious to increase the number; but these were provokingly
indifferent to my wishes. Taking the assertions of these authors for facts, I reasoned thus:
In all probability there are eggs enough in each of those stocks. Why not drive out a portion
of the bees, with the old queen, and leave about as many as if a swarm had issued? Those left
will then raise a queen, and continue the old stock, and I shall have six instead of the three,
that have been so obstinate. Accordingly, I divided each, examined and found eggs and larvæ.
Of course all must be right. Now, thought I, my stocks can be doubled at least annually. If
they do not swarm, I can drive them.

THE RESULT UNSATISFACTORY.

My swarms prospered, the old stocks seemed industrious, bringing in pollen in abundance, which
to me at that time, was conclusive that they had a queen, or soon would have. I continued to
watch them with much interest, but somehow, after a few weeks, there did not seem to be quite
as many bees; a few days later, I was quite sure there was not. I examined the combs, and behold
there was not a cell containing a young bee of any age, not even an egg in any one of these
old stocks. My visionary anticipations of future success speedily retrograded about this time.

I had, it is true, my new swarms in condition to winter, although not quite full; but the old
ones were not, and nothing was gained. I had some honey, a great deal of bee-bread and old
black comb. Had I let them alone, and put on boxes, I should have probably obtained twenty-five
or thirty pounds of pure honey from each, worth five times as much as what I did get; besides,
the old stocks, even with the old comb, would have been better supplied with both honey and
bees; altogether much better, as stocks for wintering. Here was a considerable loss, merely
by not understanding the matter.

I carefully looked the bees over, and ascertained to a certainty that neither of them had a
queen. I smothered what few there was left in the fall. I then knew of no better way. I had
been told that the barbarous use of fire and brimstone was part of the "luck;" that a more
benevolent system would cause the bees "to run out," &c.

FURTHER EXPERIMENTS.

Subsequent to these experiments, I thought perhaps the jarring of the hives in driving might
have some effect on the bees, and prevent their rearing a queen. This idea suggested the dividing
hive, when the division could be made quietly; but success was yet uncertain. I was told to
confine the bees in the old stock twenty-four hours or more, after driving out a swarm; this
I tried, with no better results. Again, I drove out the swarm, looked out the queen, and returned
her to the old stock, compelling the new swarm to raise one. To be certain they did so, I constructed
a small box about four inches square, by two in thickness; the sides glass. In this I put the
piece of brood-comb containing eggs and larvæ, and then put it on the hive containing the swarm,
having holes for communication, a cover to keep it dark, &c. They were very sure to rear queens,
but from some cause were lost after they were matured.

Now, if others have been more successful in these experiments than myself, it indicates that
some favorable circumstances attended them that did not me. I have not the least doubt but
the result will be favorable sometimes. Yet from the foregoing, I became satisfied that not
one of these methods could be relied upon. Instead of constructing a queen's cell, and then
removing the egg or larva to it from another cell, I always found that the cell containing
such egg or larva was changed from the horizontal to the perpendicular; such cells as were
in the way below were cut off, probably using the material in forming one for royalty, which,
when finished, contains as much material as fifty or a hundred others.

My experiments did not end here. I can now make artificial swarms, and succeed nine times in
ten with the first effort, and the reader can as easily do the same. It must be in the swarming
season, or as soon as the first regular swarm issues. You want some finished royal cells that
any stock having cast a swarm will furnish, (unless in rare instances, where they are too far
up among the combs to be seen.)

A SUCCESSFUL METHOD.

When you are all ready, take a stock that can spare a swarm; if bees are on the outside, raise
the hive on wedges, and drive them in with a little water, and disturb them gently with a stick.
Now smoke and invert it, setting the empty hive over. If the two hives are of one size, and
have been made by a workman, there will be no chance for the bees to escape, except the holes
in the side; these you will stop; (no matter about a sheet tied around it.) With a light hammer
or stick, strike the hive a few times lightly, and then let it remain five minutes. This is
very essential, because most of the bees, if allowed the opportunity, will fill themselves
with honey after such disturbance.

All regular swarms go forth so laden. A supply is necessary when bad weather follows soon after.
It is also used in forming wax, a very necessary article in a new hive. The amount of honey
carried out of a stock by a good swarm, together with the weight of the bees (which is not
much), will vary from five to eight pounds.

This, allowing time for the bees to fill their sacks, and supplying the old stock with a royal
cell, I believe is entirely original: the importance of which the reader can judge.

ADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD.

It is very plain that a queen from such finished cell must be ready to deposit eggs several
days sooner than by any other method that we can adopt. It is also clear that if we have a
dozen queens depositing eggs by the 10th of June, that our bees are increasing faster, on the
whole, than if but half that number are engaged in it for a month later. There is yet another
advantage. The sooner a young queen can take the place of the old one in maternal duties, the
less time will be lost in breeding, the more bees there will be to defend the combs from the
moth, and the surest guaranty for surplus honey.

When the bees have filled their sacks, proceed to drive them into the upper hive by striking
the lower one rapidly from five to ten minutes. A loud humming will mark their first movement.
When you think half or two-thirds are out, raise the hive and inspect progress. They are not
at all disposed to sting in this stage of proceeding, even when they escape outside. If full
of honey, they are seldom provoked to resentment. The only care will be not to crush too many
that get between the edges of the hives. The loud buzzing is no sign of anger. If your swarm
is not large enough, continue to drive till it is. When done, the new hive should be set on
the stand of the old one. A few minutes will decide whether you have the queen with the swarm,
as they remain quiet: otherwise uneasy, and run about, when it will be necessary to drive again.

If both hives are one color, set the old one two feet in front; but if of different colors,
a little more. I prefer this position to setting the old stock on one side, even when there
is room; yet it can make but little difference. Should you set it on one side, let the distance
be less. When the old stock is taken much farther than this rule, all the bees that have marked
the location (and all the old ones will have done so) will go back to the old stand, and none
but young bees that have never left home will remain. The same will be the case with the new
swarm if moved off. It will not do to depend on the old queen keeping them, as she does when
they swarm out naturally. This has been my experience. Try it, reader, and be satisfied, by
putting either of the hives fifteen or twenty feet distant.

Before you turn over the old stock, look among the combs as far as possible for queens' cells;
if any contain eggs or larvæ, you may safely risk their rearing a queen; but otherwise wait
till next morning, or at least twenty-four hours, then go to a stock that has cast a swarm,
and obtain a finished royal cell, as before directed, and introduce it. Stock who has been act, it

topmost hives, it is thus swift-passing, tenacious, to enjoy; straightway,
nay of all.

 Thus
the increase of bees is not enough to replace the old ones that are continually dying off.
It is plain, therefore, that this stock must soon dwindle down to a very small family. Now
let a scarcity of honey occur in the fields, this poor stock cannot be properly guarded, and
is easily plundered of its contents by the others. Honey is taken that is in close proximity
to dead bodies, corrupting by thousands, creating a pestilential vapor, of which it has probably
absorbed a portion. The seeds of destruction are by this means carried into healthy stocks.
In a short time, these in turn fall victims to the scourge; and soon dwindle away, when some
other strong stock is able to carry off their stores; and only stop, perhaps, at the last stock!
The moth is ever ready with her burden of eggs, which she now without hindrance deposits directly
on the combs. In a short time the worms finish up the whole business, and are judged guilty
of the whole charge; merely because they are found carrying out effects that speedily follow
such causes.

Let the reader who doubts this theory, simply strain out honey, vitiated in this way, and feed
it to a few stocks or swarms, that are healthy; and if they escape, communicate the fact to
the public. But should he become satisfied that such honey is poison to his bees, he will with
me, and all others interested, wish to stop this growing evil.

NOT EASILY DETECTED AT FIRST.

It is very difficult to detect the first hundred or two that die in a stock. But when nine-tenths
of the breeding cells hold putrid larvæ, there is but very little trouble in making out a correct
diagnosis. The bees are few and inactive. When passing the hive our olfactories are saluted
with a nauseous effluvia, arising from this corrupting mass. Now, if we wish, or expect to
escape, the most severe penalty, our neglect must never allow this extent of progression before
such a stock is removed. Therefore, we must watch symptoms--ascertain the presence of the disease
at the earliest moment possible.

SYMPTOMS TO BE OBSERVED.

As no part of the breeding season is exempt, the stocks should be carefully observed during
spring, and fore part of summer, relative to increase of bees. When one or more is much behind
others in this respect, make an examination immediately. (I would here urge again the convenience
of the simple, common hive, over those more complicated, or suspended, and difficult to turn
over. In one case we might make an examination in season; in the other, too much trouble and
difficulty might cause it to be put off too long.) The hive must be inverted, and the bees
smoked out of the way. Our attention is to be directed to the breeding cells; with a sharp-pointed
knife, proceed to cut off the ends of some of them that appear to be the oldest; bearing in
mind that young bees are always white, until some time after they take the chrysalis state.
Therefore, if a larva is found of a dark color, it is dead! Should a dozen such be found, the
stock should be condemned at once, and all the bees driven into an empty hive. (The directions
for this have been given, see page 31.) If honey should be scarce, at the time, they should be fed.

SCALDING THE HONEY TO DESTROY THE POISON FOR FEEDING.

The honey from the old hive may be used, if you will only first destroy the virus. This, I
have ascertained, may be done by scalding: add a half-pint of water to about ten lbs.; stir
it well, and heat it to the boiling point, and carefully remove all the scum.

Stocks in which the disease has not progressed too far, will generally swarm.

WHEN TO EXAMINE STOCKS THAT HAVE SWARMED.

Three weeks from the first swarm, will be the time to examine them. I make it a rule to inspect
all my stocks at this period. It is easily done now, as about all the healthy brood (except
drones) should be matured in that time. By perseverance in these rules, I allow no stocks to
dwindle away until they are plundered by others. If all my neighbors were equally careful,
this disease would probably soon disappear. This is like one careless farmer allowing a noxious
weed to mature seeds, to be wafted by winds on the lands of a careful neighbor, who must fortify
his mind to continual vigilance, or endure the injury of a foul pest. So with the successful
apiarian; in sections where the disease has appeared (it has not in all), he must be continually
on the watch; it is the price of success.

CARE IN SELECTING STOCK HIVES FOR WINTER.

Again, after the breeding season is over, in the fall, every stock should be thoroughly inspected,
and all diseased ones condemned for stock hives. It is better to do it, even if it should take
the last one. It would pay much better to procure others instead, that are healthy.

Persons wishing to eat the honey from such hives, will experience no bad effects from it, if
they are careful to remove all the dead brood, as they take it out of the hive.

The greatest distance that I ever knew bees to go, and plunder a defenceless stock of its contents,
was three-fourths of a mile. Very likely they would go farther on some occasions, but not often.

ACCUSATIONS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

Careless bee-keepers, when their hives are thus robbed, feel regret, or are more often vexed
at somebody--at the result of their carelessness. The person, keeping most bees in a neighborhood,
must expect to be accountable for all effects of their ignorance, mismanagement, or carelessness,
and consequent "bad luck;" when all the honey thus obtained, probably carries with it more
mischief than can be eradicated in a twelvemonth, thereby giving the real cause of complaint
to the other party.

CHAPTER XVIII.

IRRITABILITY OF BEES.

Keeping bees good-natured, offers a pretty fair subject for ridicule: it seems rather too absurd
to teach a bee anything! Nevertheless, it is worth while to think of it a little. Most of us
know that by injudicious training, horses, cattle, dogs, &c., may be rendered extremely vicious.
If there is no perceptible analogy between these and bees, experience proves that they may
be made ten times more irritable than they naturally would be.

THEIR MEANS OF DEFENCE.

Nature has armed them with means to defend their stores, and provided them with combativeness
sufficient to use them when necessary. This could not be bettered. If they were powerless to
repel an enemy, there are a thousand lazy depredators, man not excepted, who would prey upon
the fruits of their industry, leaving them to starve. Had it been so arranged, this industrious
insect would probably have long since been extinct.

TIME OF GREATEST IRRITABILITY.

The season of their greatest caution, in this section, is August, during the flowers of buckwheat.
It is then their stores are greatest. As soon as a stock is pretty well supplied with this
world's goods, like some bipeds, they become very haughty, proud, aristocratic, and insolent.
A great many things are construed into insults, that in their days of adversity would pass
unnoticed; but now it is becoming and proper for their honor to show a "just resentment." It
behooves us, therefore, to ascertain what are considered insults.

PROPER CONDUCT.

First, all quick motions, such as running, striking, &c., about them, are noticed. If our movements
among them are slow, cautious, humble, and respectful, we are often let to pass unmolested,
having manifested a becoming deportment. Yet the exhalations from some persons appear very
offensive, as they attack them much sooner than others; though I apprehend there is not so
great a difference as many suppose. Whenever an attack is made, and a sting follows, the venom
thus imparted to the air, if by only one, is perceived by others at some distance, which will
immediately approach the scene, and more stings are likely to follow than if the first had
not been.

HOW TO PROCEED WHEN ATTACKED.

Striking them down renders them ten times more furious. Not in the least daunted, they return
to the attack. Not the least show of fear is perceived. Even after losing their sting, they
obstinately refuse to desist. It is much the best way to walk as quietly as possible to the
shelter of some bush, or to the house. They will seldom go inside of the door.

A PERSON'S BREATH OFFENSIVE, AND OTHER CAUSES.

The breath of a person inside the hive, or among them, when clustered outside, is considered
in the tribunals of their insect wisdom as the greatest indignity. A sudden jar, sometimes
made by carelessly turning up the hive, is another. After being once thoroughly irritated in
this way, they remember it for weeks, and are continually on the alert; the moment the hive
is touched, they are ready to salute a person's face. When slides of tin or zinc are used to
cut off the communication between the hives and boxes, some of the bees are apt to be crushed
or cut in two. This they remember, and retaliate, as occasion offers; and it may be when quietly
walking in the apiary.

THEIR MANNER OF ATTACK.

I must disagree with any one who says we always have warning before being stung. I have been
stung a few times myself. Two-thirds of them were received without the least notice--the first
intimation was the "blow." At other times, when fully determined on vengeance, I have had them
strike my hat and remain a moment endeavoring to effect their object. In this case, I have
warning to hold down my face to protect it from the next attempt, which is quite sure to follow.
As they fly horizontally, the face held in that position is not so liable to be attacked. When
they are not so thoroughly charged with anger, they often approach in merely a threatening
attitude, buzzing around very provokingly for several minutes in close proximity to our ears
and face, apparently to ascertain our intentions. If nothing hostile or displeasing is perceived,
they will generally leave; but should a quick motion or offensive breath offend them, the dreaded
result is almost sure to follow. Too many people are apt to take these threatening manifestations
as positive intentions to sting. When these things can be quietly endured, and at the same
time leave their vicinity, it generally ends peaceably. They never make an attack while away
from their home in quest of honey, or on their return, until they have entered the hive. It
is only in the hive and its vicinity that we expect to meet this irascible temperament, which
should not be allowed, or at least may be subdued in a great measure, if not entirely, by doing
things in a quiet manner, and, by the use of tobacco smoke. Any person having the care of bees
should go armed with this powerful weapon. As bees are not much affected with smoke, while
flying in the air, but will have their own way, we must take them in the hive as the place
to teach them a proper deportment!

Those who are accustomed to smoking will find a pipe or segar very convenient here. But such
as are not would do better, perhaps, not to learn a bad habit. I will therefore give a simple
substitute.

SMOKER DESCRIBED.

Get a tube of tin about five-eighths of an inch diameter, five or six inches in length; make
stoppers of wood to fit both ends, two and a half or three inches long; with your nail-gimlet
make a hole through them lengthwise: when put together it should be about ten inches. The ends
may be tapered. On one end leave a notch, that it may be held with the teeth, which is the
most convenient way, as you will often want to use both hands: it is also always ready, without
any trouble to blow through, and also to keep the tobacco burning. When ready to operate, fill
the tube with tobacco, ignite it, and put in the stoppers; by blowing through it you keep the
tobacco burning while the smoke issues at the other end.

EFFECT OF TOBACCO SMOKE.

We can now subdue these combative propensities, or render them harmless; turn their anger to
submission, and make them yield their treasures to the hands of the spoiler without an effort
of resistance! When once overpowered, they seem to lose all knowledge of their strength, and
no slave can be more submissive! After the effects of the smoke have passed off, their former
animosity will return. Should any resentment be shown on raising a hive, blow in the smoke;
they immediately retreat, "begging pardon." After a few times, they learn "it's no use," and
allow an inspection. If you wish to take off a box, raise it just enough to blow under the
smoke; there is no trouble; you can replace it with another; the bees are kept out of the way
with a little more smoke, and no anger created about it to be remembered. Those in the box
are all submission; they can be carried away and handled as you please, without a possibility
of getting them irritated, until they once more get home, and then are much more "amiable"
than if the box had been taken without the smoke. They seem to forget, or do not realize anything
of the transaction. When bees are to be transferred to a new hive, it is unnecessary to be
so very particular about the escape of a single bee; no fears need be entertained of such as
get out. In driving, the loud humming indicates their submission; the upper hive can then be
safely raised at any time. After being thus driven out, they may be pushed about with impunity,
and still be quiet! In short, by using smoke on all occasions where they would be likely to
be disturbed without it by our meddling with them, it has a tendency to keep dormant their
combative propensities. When these have never been aroused, there is much less danger from
their attacks while walking or looking among them. Any one wishing further proof, I would recommend
the experiment of managing one year with smoke, and the next without.

STING DESCRIBED.

Their sting, as it appears to the naked eye, is but a tiny instrument of war; so small, indeed,
that its wound would pass unheeded by all the larger animals, if it was not for the poison
introduced at the same instant. It has been described as being "composed of three parts, a
sheath and two darts. Both the darts are furnished with small points or barbs like a fishhook,"
that hold it when introduced into the flesh; the bee being compelled to leave it behind.

DOES ITS LOSS PROVE FATAL?

It is said "to the bee itself this mutilation proves fatal." This last is another assertion
for fact, so often repeated, that perhaps we might as well admit it; seeing the difficulty
we should have in disproving it. Only think of the impossibility of keeping our eye, for five
minutes, on a bee that is flying about, after it has left its sting. Yet there are some persons
so very particular about what they receive as facts, that they would require this very unreasonable
thing of watching a bee till it died, before they could be positively sure that the loss of
its sting caused its death. (It is much easier to guess.) They might even take analogy, and
say that other insects possess so little sensation that they have been known to recover after
much more extensive mutilation--that beetles have lived for months under circumstances that
would have instantly killed some of the higher animals--that spiders often reproduce a leg,
even lobsters can replace a lost claw, &c. I have put off describing any protection against
their attacks, because I wish to get up a little more courage in our doings among them. Yet
it is folly to expect all will manage successfully without something for defence.

MEANS OF PROTECTION.

The face and hands are most exposed; for the latter, thick woollen mittens or gloves are best;
the sting is generally left when thrust into a leather glove. For the face procure one and
a half yards of thin muslin or calico, sew the ends together, the upper end gathered on a string
small enough to prevent it slipping over the head when put on. An arm-hole is to be cut out
on each side; below is another string to gather it close to the body. As I do not expect you
to work in the dark, we will have a place cut out in front, and a piece of coarse lace inserted;
that which will just prevent a bee from passing, is best, as it gives us a better chance to
see. To keep it from falling against the face, a wire is bent around and sewed fast. Any person
that knows how to put on a shirt will manage this. When thus equipped, and other garments of
proper thickness, the most timid ought not to hesitate to venture among them, when necessary.
I cannot avoid cautioning you again to beware of irritating your bees, until this protection
is necessary, as it is a rather bad state of things. With this on, you cannot conveniently
use any smoke. To put this on and off is considerable trouble, and every time you go among
them, if you have to resort to this, I fear some necessary duties will be neglected. Whenever
a partial protection will do, I would recommend a handkerchief; it is always at hand, and can
be put on in a moment; throw it over the head, letting the ends fall around the neck and shoulders,
covering all but the face. The hat can come on over it. As for the face, whenever a bee comes
around in a menacing attitude, hold it down--unless he stings at the first onset, there is
not much risk.

REMEDIES FOR STINGS.

Concerning the remedies for stings, it is a hard matter to tell which is the best. There is
so much difference in the effect in different individuals, and the different parts of the body,
as well as the depth the sting reaches, that a great variety of remedies are recommended.

A person is slightly stung, and applies something as an antidote; the effect of the sting is
trifling, as perhaps it would have been without anything, and the medicine is forthwith extolled
as a sovereign remedy. I have been thus deceived; when slightly stung applied what I thought
cured in one case, when in the next the sting might have penetrated deeper, or in some other
place, and the remedy would seem to have no effect. For the last few years, I have not made
any application whatever for myself, and the effect is no worse, nor even as bad as formerly.
(This, I am told, is because the system is hardened, and now can resist or throw off the effects.)
Among the remedies recommended, are saleratus and water, salt and water, soft-soap mixed with
salt, a raw onion cut in two and one-half applied, mud or clay mixed pretty wet and changed
often, tobacco wet and rubbed thoroughly to get at the strength, and cold water constantly
applied. To cure the smart, the application of tobacco is strongly urged, and cold water is
spoken of with equal favor to prevent the swelling.

When stung in the throat, drinking often of salt and water is said will prevent serious consequences.

Whether any of these remedies are applied or not, I suppose it is unnecessary to say that the
sting should be pulled out as soon as practicable.

CHAPTER XIX.

ENEMIES OF BEES.

Among the enemies of bees, there are included rats, mice, birds, toads, and insects.

ARE THEY ALL GUILTY?

But some of these are probably clear of any actual mischief. I strongly suspect that the spirit
of destructiveness with many people is altogether too active. There are some farmers, with
this principle predominant, so short-sighted, that if it was in their power they would destroy
a whole class of birds, because some of them had picked a few cherries, or dug out a few hills
of corn, when, at the same time, they are indebted to their activity in devouring worms, insects,
&c., that would otherwise have destroyed entire crops! It will be well, therefore, before condemnation,
to see if on the whole we are to be gainers or losers by an indiscriminate slaughter, without
judge or jury.

RATS AND MICE.

Rats and mice are never troublesome, except in cold weather. The entrances of all hives standing
out are too small to admit a rat. It is only when in the house that much damage need be apprehended.
They appear to be fond of honey, and when it is accessible will eat several pounds in a short time.

Mice will often enter the hive when standing on the bench, and make extensive depredations.
Sometimes, after eating a space in the combs, they will there make their nest. The animal heat
created by the bees will make a snug, warm place for winter quarters. There are two kinds:
one the common class, belonging to the house; the other called "deer-mouse"--the under side
perfectly white, the back much lighter than the other kind. The latter seems to be particularly
fond of the bees, while the first appears to relish the honey. Whether they take bees that
are alive, or only such as are already dead, I cannot say. Only a part of the bee is eaten;
and if we take the fragments left to judge of the number consumed, the circumstance will go
some ways to prove the sacrifice of quite a number. Whether bees or honey is wasted, a little
care to prevent their depredations is well worthy of bestowal. As rats and mice have so long
since been condemned and sentenced for being a universal plague, and without a redeeming trait,
I will say nothing in their favor, and am perfectly willing they shall be hanged till dead.

ARE ALL THE BIRDS GUILTY?

But for some of the birds accused of preying upon bees, I would say a word.

KING-BIRD--ONE WORD IN HIS FAVOR.

The king-bird stands at the head of the list of depredators! With a fair trial he will be found
guilty, though not so heinously criminal as many suppose. I think we shall find him guilty
of taking only the drones. In the afternoon of a fair day he may be seen perched upon some
dry branch of a shrub or tree near the apiary, watching for his victims, occasionally darting
to seize them. I have shot him down and examined his crop, after seeing him devour a goodly
number; but in every instance the bees were so crushed to pieces, that it was impossible to
distinguish workers from drones. We are told of great numbers of workers being counted. It
may be so, or it may be thus represented by a spice of prejudice. I have found the brutal gratification
of taking life so strong with some, that a natural antipathy is allowed to take the place of
justice, and a proper defence is not allowed in such cases where the suffering party has not
the power to enforce it. If he was satisfied with workers as well as drones, why does he not
visit the apiary long before noon, and fill his crop with them? But instead, he waits till
afternoon for the drones; and if none are flying, he watches quietly till one appears, although
workers may be out by hundreds continually. If the question is asked, how they tell the difference
in the two kinds of bees, I might suggest that instinct has taught most animals the proper
kind of food, and might direct the birds in this case. If it was not sufficient, a little experience
in catching bees provided with stings, might impart the important difference, in one or two
lessons. I once had a chicken that knew the difference by some means, and would stand by the
hive and devour every drone, the moment it touched the board, while the workers would pass
by him in scores untouched!

Now, whether this taking the drones is a disadvantage or otherwise, would depend entirely upon
circumstances. If honey was a little scarce, the less we had of them the better; it would also
save the bees some trouble in dispatching them. It is probably a matter of so little moment
to our bees, that it will not pay for powder to shoot them.

Martins, and a kind of swallows, are said to be guilty of taking bees on some occasions; but
as they pursue them on the wing (if they do), the same remarks will apply as to the king-bird.

CAT-BIRD ACQUITTED.

The cat-bird also comes in for a share of censure. It is said "they will get right down by
the hive, and pick up bees by the hundred." Yet, right in the face of this charge, I am disposed
to acquit him. With the closest observation, I find him about the hive, picking up only young
and immature bees, such as are removed from the combs and thrown out. They may be seen as soon
as the first rays of light make objects visible about the apiary, looking for their morning
supply, as well as frequent visits during the day. Should an unlucky worm be in sight just
then, while looking up a place for spinning a cocoon, or a moth reposing on some corner of
the hive, their fate is at once decided. Before destroying this bird, it would be well to judge
by actual observation as to facts; otherwise we might "destroy a friend instead of a foe."

TOAD GOT CLEAR.

A toad is discovered near the hives, and forthwith he is executed as a bee-eater. "He ought
to be killed for his looks, if nothing else!" He is thus often sacrificed really on account
of his appearance, while pretending he is a villain. It is true his "feathers" will not vie
in brilliancy with the plumage of the humming-bird, and do not gratify ideality--therefore
he is dispatched. The next week the complaint is made that the little bugs, that he might have
destroyed, "have eaten up all the little cucumbers and cabbages." His food is probably small
insects. Whoever has seen him swallow bees, must have watched closer than I ever did.

WASPS AND HORNETS NOT FAVORED.

As for the frequent visits of the black-wasp in the sunny days of spring, but little can be
said in their favor--they seem to have no other object but to tease and irritate the bees.
I never could discover that they entered the hive for the purpose of plunder. They have frequent
battles with the bees, but I never saw any bees devoured or carried off, nor even killed. After
the first of June they are seldom troublesome. The yellow wasp or hornet, that is around in
autumn, is of but little account; their object is honey, which they take when they can get
it, but are not apt to enter the hive among the bees.

ANTS--A WORD IN THEIR FAVOR.

Ants come in for a share of condemnation. This little industrious insect shall have my endeavors
for a fair hearing; I think I can understand why they are so frequently accused of robbing
bees. Many bee-keepers are wholly ignorant, most of the time, of the real condition of their
stocks. Many causes independent of ants, induce a reduction of population. Suppose the bees
are so reduced as to leave the combs unprotected, and the ants enter and appropriate some of
the honey to themselves, and should the owner come along just then and see them engaged, "Ha!
you are the rascals that have destroyed my bees," without a thought of looking for causes,
beyond present appearances. They are often unjustly accused by the farmer of injuring the growth
of his little trees, by causing the tender leaves to curl and wither. Inquiries are often made
in some of the agricultural papers for means to destroy them, merely because they are found
on them; when the real cause of the mischief is with the plant louse, (aphis) that is upon
the leaves or stalk in hundreds, robbing them of their important juices, and secreting a fluid
greatly prized by the ants. By destroying the lice, you remove all the attraction of the ants.
The peculiar habits of the small black ants, probably give rise to a suspicion of mischief
in this way. They live in communities of thousands--their nests are usually in old walls, in
old timber, under stones, and in the earth. From their nests a string may be traced sometimes
for rods, going after, and returning laden with food. During a spell of wet weather, such as
would make the earth and many other places too damp and cold for a nest, they look out for
better quarters. The top or chamber of our bee-hives affords shelter from rain. The animal
heat from the bees renders it perfectly comfortable. How then can we blame them for choosing
such a location, so completely answering all their wants? As long as the bees are not disturbed,
we can put up with it better. But the careless observer having discovered their train to and
fro from their nest on the hive, exclaims: "Why, I have seen them going in a continual stream
to the hive after honey;" when a little scrutiny into the matter would show that only the nest
was on the top of the hive, and they were going somewhere else for food; not one to be seen
entering the hive among the bees for honey, (at least I never could detect it.)

When honey is unprotected by bees, or boxes of it placed where they can have access, as a natural
consequence, they will carry off some; but it is easily secured.

SPIDER CONDEMNED.

Spiders are a source of considerable annoyance to the apiarian, as well as to the bees; not
so much on account of the number of bees consumed, as their habit of spinning a web about the
hive, that will occasionally take a moth, and will probably entangle fifty bees the whilst.
They are either in fear of the bees, or they are not relished as food; particularly, as a bee
caught in the morning is frequently untouched during the day. This web is often exactly before
the entrance, entangling the bees as they go out and return; irritating and hindering them
considerably. They often escape after repeated struggles. I have removed a web from the same
place every morning, for a week, that was renewed at night with astonishing perseverance! I
can generally look out his hiding-place, which is in some corner near by, and dispatch him.
His redeeming qualities are few, and are more than balanced by the evil, as far as I have discovered.
Their sagacity in some instances will find a place of concealment not easily discovered. At
the approach of cold weather, the box or chamber of the hive being a little warmer than other
places, will attract a great many there to deposit their eggs. Little piles of webbing or silk
may be seen attached to the top of the hive, or sides of boxes. These contain eggs for the
next year's brood. This is the time to destroy them and save trouble for the future.

If we combine into one phalanx all the depredators yet named, and compare their ability for
mischief with the wax moth, we shall find their powers of destruction but a small item! Of
the moth itself we would have nothing to fear were it not for her progeny, that consist of
a hundred or a thousand vile worms, whose food is principally wax or comb.

As the instinct of the flesh-fly directs her to a putrid carcass to deposit her eggs, that
her offspring may have their proper food, so the moth seeks the hive containing combs, and
where its natural food is at hand to furnish a supply. During the day a rusty brown miller,
with its wings wrapped close around the body, may be often seen lying perfectly motionless
on the side of the hive on one corner, or the under edge of the top, where it projects over--they
are more frequent at the corners than anywhere else, one-third of their length projecting beyond
it; appearing much like a sliver on the edge of a board that is somewhat weather-beaten. Their
color so closely resembles old wood, that I have no doubt their enemies are often deceived,
and let them escape with their lives. As soon as daylight shuts out the view, and no danger
of their movements being discovered by their enemies, they throw off their inactivity, and
commence searching for a place to deposit their eggs, and woe to the stock that has not bees
sufficient to drive them from the comb. Although their larvæ has a skin that the bee cannot
pierce with its sting, in most cases, it is not so with the moth, and of this fact they seem
to be aware, for whenever a bee approaches they dart away with speed ten times greater than
that of any bee, disposed to follow! They enter the hive and dodge out in a moment, having
either encountered a bee, or fear they may do so. Now it needs no argument to prove that when
all our stocks are well protected, that it must be a poor chance to deposit eggs, on the combs
of such hives, where their instinct has taught them is the proper place. But they must leave
them somewhere. When driven from all the combs within, the next best place is the cracks and
flaws about the hive, that are lined with propolis; and the dust and chips that fall on the
floor-board of a young swarm not full will be used. This last material is mostly wax, and answers
very well instead of comb. The eggs will here hatch and the worms sometimes ascend to the combs;
hence the necessity of keeping the bottom brushed off clean. It will prevent those that are
on the bottom from going up; also the bees from taking up any eggs, if this should happen to
be the method. I can conceive of no other way by which they get among the combs of a populous
stock; where they are often detected, having been deposited by some means. A worm lodged in
the comb, makes his way to the centre, and then eats a passage as he proceeds, lining it with
a shroud of silk, gradually enlarging it, as he increases in size. (When combs are filled with
honey, they work on the surface, eating only the sealing.) In very weak families this silken
passageway is left untouched,--but removed by all the stronger ones. I have found it asserted
that "the worms would be all immediately destroyed by the bees, were it not for a kind of dread
in touching them until compelled to by necessity." As the facts which led to this conclusion
are not given, and I can find none confirming it, perhaps I shall be excused if I have no faith.
On the contrary, I find to all appearance an instinctive antipathy to all such intruders, and
are removed immediately when possessing the power.

When a worm is in a comb filled with brood, its passage being in the centre, it is not at first
discovered. The bees, to get it out, must bite away half the thickness, removing the brood
in one or two rows of cells, sometimes for several inches. This will account for so many immature
bees found on the bottom board at morning, in the spring; as well as in stocks and swarms but
partially protected after the swarming season.

INDICATIONS OF THEIR PRESENCE.

Sometimes a half dozen young bees, nearly mature, will be removed alive, all webbed together,
fastened by legs, wings, &c. All their efforts for breaking loose prove unavailing. Also others
that are separate may be seen running about with their wings mutilated, or part of their legs
eaten off, or tied together! These generally are the first symptoms of worms in our stock at
this season. Although unfavorable, it might be worse. It shows that the bees are not discouraged
yet,--that when finding the worms present, have sufficient energy left to make an effort to
rid themselves of the nuisance.

MANAGEMENT.

Should the apiarian now give them a little assistance for a few days, they will soon be in
a prosperous condition. The hive should be frequently raised, and everything brushed out clean.
If it is a new swarm half full, that presents these indications, it should be turned over a
few times, perhaps once a week, till the worms are mastered; and the corners below the bees
examined for the cocoons, that will very often be found there, and are easily detached and
destroyed. In turning over a hive part full, in warm weather, you should first observe the
position of the combs, and let the edges rest against the side of the hive, otherwise they
might bend over and break loose when the hive was again set up, (by simply making a pencil
mark across the top in the direction of the combs, you may know any time after first looking).

CARE IN TURNING OVER HIVES.

When a hive is full of combs, the edges are usually attached sufficient to steady them, and
it is of less consequence which way it is turned, yet in very warm weather the honey will run
out of drone cells if perpendicular.

In very small swarms, hundreds of the young brood may be frequently seen with their heads out
of the cells, endeavoring to escape, but are firmly held inside by these webs. I have known
a few instances in such circumstances, where it appeared as if the bees had cut off the whole
sheet of comb and let it drop, thereby ridding themselves of all further trouble (or would
be rid of it, if their owner only did his part by taking out what fell down.)

OTHER SYMPTOMS OF WORMS.

But when the bees make no effort to dislodge the enemy or his works in old stocks, the case
is somewhat desperate! Instead of the foregoing symptoms we must look for something entirely
different. But few young bees will be found. In their place we may find the fæces of the worms
dropped on the board. During winter and spring the bees, in biting off the covering of cells
to get at the honey, drop chips closely resembling it. To detect the difference and distinguish
one from the other requires a little close inspection. The color of the fæces varies with the
comb on which they feed, from white to brown and black. The size of these grains will be in
proportion to the worm--from a mere speck to nearly as large as a pin-head: shape cylindrical,
with obtuse ends: length about twice its diameter. By the quantity we can judge of the number.
If the hive is full of combs the lower ends may appear perfect, while the middle or upper part
is sometimes a mat of webs!

Whenever our stocks have become reduced from over-swarming or other cause, this is the next
effect in succession that we must expect. Here is another important reason that we know the
actual condition of our bees at all times; we can then detect the worms very soon after they
commence. In some instances we might save the stock by breaking out most of the combs, leaving
just enough to be covered by the bees. When success attends this operation, it must be done
before the worms have progressed to a thorough lodgment. When the stock is weak, and appearances
indicate the presence of many, it is generally the safest, and will be the least trouble in
the end, to drive out the bees at once and secure the honey and wax. The bees when put into
a new hive may do a little, but if they should do nothing, it would be no worse. It cannot
be as bad any way as to have left them in the old hive till the worms had destroyed all and
matured a thousand or two moths in addition to those otherwise produced, thereby multiplying
the chances of damage to other stocks a thousand-fold. It is probably remembered that I said
when bees are removed from a hive in warm weather, if it was not infested with worms at the
time, it soon would be, unless smoked with sulphur.

WHEN THEY GROW LARGER THAN USUAL.

In a hive thus left without bees to interfere, the worms will increase to one-half or two-thirds
larger than where their right to the combs is disputed. In one case they often have their growth,
and actually wind up in their cocoon when less than an inch in length: in the other they will
quietly fatten till they are an inch and a half long and as large as a pipe-stem.

TIME OF GROWTH.

When first hatched from the egg, it requires very close inspection to see them with the naked
eye. The rapidity of growth depends on the temperature in which they are, as much or more than
their good living. A few days in hot weather might develop the full-grown worm, while in a
lower temperature it would require weeks and even months in some cases, perhaps from fall till
spring.

TIME OF TRANSFORMATION.

The worm, after spinning its cocoon, soon changes to a chrysalis, and remains inactive for
several days, when it makes an opening in one end and crawls out. The time taken for this transformation
is also governed by the temperature, although I think but few ever pass the winter in this
state. It is a rare thing to find a moth before the end of May, and not many till the middle
of June; but after this time they are more numerous till the end of the season.

FREEZING DESTROYS WORMS, COCOON AND MOTH.

It is pretty well demonstrated that the moth, its eggs, larvæ and chrysalis cannot pass the
winter without warmth of some kind to prevent their freezing to death. The following facts
indicate this. I have taken all the bees out of a hive in the fall, and without disturbing
the comb or honey, put it in a cold chamber where it could freeze thoroughly. In the following
March bees were again introduced, and when not on a bench with some other stock that had worms,
not a single instance in forty cases has ever produced a worm before the middle of June, or
until the eggs of some moth matured in another hive has had time to hatch. I have sometimes,
instead of putting bees in these in March, kept them till June for swarms, perfectly free from
any appearance of worms!

HOW THEY PASS THE WINTER.

But it is altogether a different thing with our hives in which bees are wintered; they are
seldom or never entirely exempt! Perhaps it is impossible to winter bees without preserving
some eggs of the moth or a few worms at the same time. The perfect moth perhaps never survives
the winter; the only place that the chrysalis would be safe, I think must be in the vicinity
of the bees--and a good stock will never allow it there--but eggs, it would appear, are suffered
to remain. In the fall, at the approach of cold weather, the bees are apt to leave the ends
of the combs exposed; the moth can now enter and deposit her eggs directly upon them; these,
together with what are carried in by means before suggested, are enough to prevent losing the
breed. The warmth generated by the bees will keep these eggs from freezing and preserve their
vitality. When warm weather approaches in the spring, those nearest the bees are probably hatched
first, and commence depredations and are removed by the bees. As the bees increase and occupy
more comb, more are warmed up and hatched. In this way, even a small family of bees will hatch,
and get rid of all the eggs that happen to be in their combs, and not be destroyed. This is
the time that the apiarian may be of service in destroying the worms, as the bees get them
on the floor.

STOCKS MORE LIABLE TO BE DESTROYED LAST OF SUMMER.

But in July and August it is different in this respect; a single moth may enter the hive when
exposed, and deposit her whole burden of several hundred eggs, as in the other case, but the
heat from the bees is now unnecessary to hatch them. The weather at this season will make any
part of the hive warm enough to set her whole brood at work at once, and in three weeks all
may be destroyed! This, and the fact that more moths exist now than before, may account for
the greater number of stocks being destroyed at this season. Yet it is considered extremely
bad management to allow honey or combs to be devoured by this disgusting creature. A little
care to know the condition of the stocks is necessary to prevent their getting the start. These
duties should be fully considered before we take the responsibility of the care of bees.

WHEN BEES ARE SAFE.

The only condition when we can rest and feel safe is when we know all our stocks are full of
bees. Even the "moth-proof" hive containing combs will be scented out by the moth, when there
are no bees to guard it. An argument to show that a moth can enter where a bee can go is unnecessary,
and a little observation, I think, will prove that her eggs sometimes go where she is not allowed.

MEANS TO DESTROY THEM.

At this season, (July and August), it is a good plan to put a few pieces of old dry combs near
the hives, in a box, or other place, as a decoy, where the moth may have access. She will deposit
a great many of her eggs here, instead of the hive, and can be easily destroyed. As we cannot
always have our bees in a situation to feel safe, it will be well to adopt some of the means
recommended to diminish the number of moths. First destroy all the worms that can be found
at any time, particularly in spring; second, all cocoons that can be got at. A great many worms
can be enticed to web up, under a trap of elder, &c., when it is an easy matter to dispatch
them. Thirdly, destroy all the moths possible that can be seen about the hive. They are very
much like the flea, "when you put your finger on him he is not there;" a careful move is necessary
to crush him at once, otherwise he darts away at the least disturbance. Probably the most expeditious
mode is to make them drunk.

MAKING THEM DRUNK, AND THEIR EXECUTION BY CHICKENS.

Mix with water just enough molasses and vinegar to make it palatable; this is to be put in
white saucers or other dishes, and set among the hives at night. Like nobler beings, if not
wiser, when once they have tasted the fatal beverage, they seem to lose all power to leave
the fascinating cup; but give way to appetite and excitement till a fatal step plunges them
into destruction! The next morning finds them yet wallowing in filth, weak and feeble. Whether
they would recover from the effects of their carousal if lifted out of the mire, and carefully
nursed like other specimens of creation, I never ascertained. With but little trouble a chicken
or two will learn to be on hand, and greedily devour every one. Hundreds are caught in this
way, although many other kinds besides the bee-moth will be mixed with them. This drink may
be used till dried up, occasionally adding a little water; perhaps it is better after fermenting.
This recipe appeared some years ago in some paper; I have forgotten where. Salt has been recommended
to prevent the mischief of the worms, as well as a benefit to the bees. I used it pretty extensively
for several years, as I thought without much benefit, and got tired. I then tried salting a
part, and let the rest do entirely without, and found no difference in their prosperity. Since
then, some ten years ago, I abandoned its use altogether, and succeed just as well.

CHAPTER XX.

MELTING DOWN OF COMBS.

THE CAUSE.

When extreme hot weather occurs immediately after the bees have been gathering from a plentiful
harvest for two or three weeks, or even during the yield, the wax composing new combs is very
liable to be softened, till they break loose from their fastenings and settle to the bottom.

EFFECTS.

Sometimes the injury is trifling, only a piece or two slipping down; at other times the whole
contents fall in a confused and broken mass, the weight pressing out the honey, and besmearing
the bees, which in that situation creep out, and away, from the hive in every direction.

I once had some new stocks ruined, and several others injured by hot weather, in this way,
about the first of September, immediately after the flowers of buckwheat. The bees, or most
of them, being covered with honey, together with what ran out of the hive, at once attracted
bees from the others to the spot, which carried off the entire contents in a few hours. This
was an uncommon occurrence; I have known but one season in twenty-five years when it occurred
after the failure of honey in the flowers. It usually happens during a plenteous yield, and
then other stocks are not apt to be troublesome.

FIRST INDICATIONS.

The first indications of such an accident will be, the bees outside in clusters, when the hive
is perhaps only half or two-thirds full, and the honey running out from the bottom, (this is
when part has fallen.)

PREVENTION.

To prevent such occurrences as far as possible, ventilate by raising the hives on little blocks
at the corners, and effectually protect them from the sun; and if necessary, wet the outside
with cold water. At the time of losing those before mentioned, I kept all the rest of the young
swarms wet through the middle of the day, and I have no doubt but I saved several by this means.
I had some trouble with such as had only a piece or two come down, and started just honey enough
to attract other bees. It was not safe to close the hive to prevent the robbers, as this would
have made the heat still greater, and been certain destruction.

The best protection I found, was to put around the bottom of the hive a few stems of asparagus;
this gave a free circulation of air, and at the same time, made it very difficult for the robbers
to approach the entrance, without first creeping through this hedge and encountering some bees
that belonged to the hive; which, with this assistance, were enabled to defend themselves till
all wasting honey was taken up.

When the hive is nearly full, and but one or two sheets come down, the lower edge will rest
on the floor, and the other combs will keep it in an upright position, until the bees fasten
it again. It is generally as well to leave such pieces as they are. If the hive is but half
full or little more, and such pieces are not kept perpendicular by the remaining combs, they
are apt to be broken and crushed badly, by falling so far; and most of the honey will be wasted.
To save this, it will be necessary to remove it, (unless a dish can be made to catch it). Be
careful not to turn the hive on its side, and break the remaining combs, if any are left. Such
combs as contain brood and but little honey, might be left for the brood to mature. Should
the bees be able to take the honey or not waste much, it might be advisable to leave it, till
the contents were taken up; it would greatly assist in filling up. But these broken pieces
should be removed before they interfere with the combs extending to the bottom. A part of the
bees are generally destroyed, but the majority will escape; even such as are covered with honey,
(if they are not crushed) will clean it off and soon be in working order, when others do not
interfere officiously, assisting to remove it. A good yield of honey is the best protection
against this disposition to pillage. After the first year combs become thicker, and are not
so liable to give way.

CHAPTER XXI.

FALL MANAGEMENT.

FIRST CARE.

When the flowers fail at the end of the season, the first thing necessary is to ascertain which
are the weakest stocks, and all that cannot defend themselves should either be removed or reinforced.
The strength of all stocks is pretty thoroughly tested within a few days after a failure of
honey. Should any be found with too few bees for defence, they are quite sure to be plundered.
Hence the necessity of action in season, that we may secure the contents in advance of the robbers.

STRONG STOCKS DISPOSED TO PLUNDER.

Strong stocks, that during a yield have occupied every cell with brood and honey, when it fails,
will soon have empty cells left by the young bees, hatching. These empty cells, without honey
to fill them, appear to be a source of much uneasiness. Although such hive and caps may be
well stored, I have ever found them to be the worst in the apiary, much more disposed to plunder,
than weaker ones with half the honey. As weak stocks cannot be bettered now, it is best to
remove them at once, and put the temptation out of the way. Carelessness is but a sorry excuse,
for letting bees establish this habit of dishonesty. Should any stocks be weak from disease,
the consequences would be even more disastrous than bad habits; the reasons why such impure
honey should not go into thrifty stocks, have already been given. If we want the least possible
trouble with our bees, none but the best should be selected for winter. But what constitutes
a good stock, seems to be but partially understood; if we judge from the number lost annually,
too many are careless, or ignorant in the selection; supposing, perhaps, because a stock has
been good one winter and swarmed well, it must of course be right; the mistake is often fatal.

BEES CHANGEABLE.

Bees are so changeable, especially in the summer and swarming season, that we can seldom be
certain what they are, by what they have been. It is safest, therefore, to know what they are now.

REQUISITES FOR GOOD STOCKS.

The proper requisites for a good stock are a full hive of proper shape and size, (viz., 2,000
inches,) well stored with honey; a large family of bees, and in a healthy condition, which
must be ascertained by actual inspection. The age is not important till over eight years old.
Stocks possessing these points, can be wintered with but little trouble. But it cannot be expected
that all will be in this condition. Many bee-keepers will wish to increase their stocks and
keep all that is practicable, by supplying any deficiency. I shall endeavor to make it appear
profitable to do so, until bees enough are kept in the country, to get all the honey that is
now wasted.

All can understand why it is a loss to have bees eat honey part of the winter and then die--that
the honey consumed might have been saved--that it makes no great difference to the bees whether
they are killed in the fall or sacrificed in the winter. I am not an advocate for fire and
brimstone as the reward of all unfortunate stocks, and shall recommend it only when its use
will make it no worse. We will see how far it can be dispensed with.

GREAT DISADVANTAGE OF KILLING THE BEES.

Those rustic bee-keepers who are in the habit of making their hives very large, such as will
hold from 100 to 140 lbs., and killing the bees in the fall, and sending the honey to market,
will probably continue the use of sulphur, unless we can convince them of the greater advantage
of making the hive smaller and have fifty or eighty lbs. of this honey in boxes which will
sell for more than can be realized for their larger hive full, and at the same time, save their
bees for a stock-hive, making a better return in the long run, than one hundred dollars at
interest. When hives are made the proper size, the honey will not be an object sufficient to
pay for destroying the bees.

SECTION OF COUNTRY MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT POOR STOCKS NEED.

The kind of requisite to be supplied to our deficient stocks, will probably depend on the section
of country. Where the principal source is clover and basswood, it will fail partially, at least,
before the end of warm weather.

Some poor or medium stocks will continue to rear brood too extensively for their means, and
exhaust their winter stores in consequence; such will need a supply of honey. But where great
quantities of buckwheat are sown, cold weather follows almost immediately after this yield,
and stops the breeding. Consequently a scarcity of bees is more frequent than honey. There
are exceptions, of course; I am speaking of these cases generally. My experience has mostly
been in a section where this crop is raised, and will say that there is not more than one season
in ten, but that the honey will be in proportion with the bees the first of September; that
is, if there are bees enough, there will be honey enough.

WHEN BEES ARE NEEDED.

I have frequently had stocks with stores amply sufficient to carry a good family through the
winter, and yet too few bees to last till January, or even to defend themselves from the robbers.
Hence I am in the habit of supplying bees oftener than honey.

I usually have some few hives with too little honey, as well as too few bees. Now it is very
plain if the bees of one or more of this class were united with the first successfully, we
should have a respectable family. I have made additions to stocks in this way that proved first-rate.

CAUTION.

Whenever we make additions in this manner, it would be well first to ascertain what was the
cause of a scarcity of bees; if it was over-swarming or loss of queen, it is well enough--but
if from disease, reject them, unless the bees are to be transferred the next spring, and then,
when too many cells are occupied with dead brood, as the bees cannot be successfully wintered.

PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY.

The greatest difficulty in uniting two families or more in this manner, is where they have
to be taken from different places in the same apiary; where the locations have been marked.
It is sufficiently shown that bees return to the old stand.

To prevent these results, it has been recommended "to set an empty hive with some pieces of
comb, fastened in the top in the place of the one removed, to catch the bees that go back to
the old stand, and remove them at night for a few times, when they remain." This should be
done only when we cannot do better; it is considerable trouble; besides this, we do not always
succeed to our satisfaction.

HOW AVOIDED.

I like the plan of bringing them a mile or more for this purpose, and have no after trouble
about it. Two neighbors being that distance apart, each having stocks in this condition might
exchange bees, making the benefit mutual. I have done so, and considered myself well paid for
the trouble. But latterly I have had several apiaries away from home, and now manage without
difficulty.

ADVANTAGES OF MAKING ONE GOOD STOCK FROM TWO POOR ONES.

This making one good stock out of two poor ones, cannot be too highly recommended; aside from
its advantages, it relieves us from all disagreeable feelings in taking life, that we can with
but little trouble preserve.

TWO FAMILIES TOGETHER WILL NOT CONSUME AS MUCH AS IF SEPARATE.

Even when a stock already contains bees enough to make it safe for winter, another of the same
number of bees may be added, and the consumption of honey will not be five lbs. more than one
swarm would consume alone. If they should be wintered in the cold, the difference might not
be one pound. Why more bees do not consume a proportionate quantity of honey, (which the experience
of others as well as myself has thoroughly proved), is a mystery, unless the greater number
of bees creates more animal heat, and being warm, eat less, is a solution, (which if it is,
is a strong reason for keeping bees warm in winter.)

AN EXPERIMENT.

Notwithstanding all this, I cannot recommend making a good stock better by adding the bees
from another good one as a source of profit. I tried it a few times. I had purchased some large
hives for market, and wished to dispose of the bees without sulphur, and try the experiment
of uniting two or more. The next spring when they commenced work such double stocks promised
much; but when the swarming season arrived, the single swarms, such as were good and had just
about bees enough, were in the best condition, in ordinary seasons. Whether this was owing
to the circumstance of there being already bees enough that were beginning to crowd and interfere
with each other's labors, and less brood raised in consequence, or to some other reason, I
cannot say. I have often noticed, (as others have), that stocks which have cast no swarms,
are no better the next spring than others. The same cause might operate in both cases. Therefore
it would appear unnecessary to unite two or more good swarms, unless it is to spare our feelings
in destroying the bees. The two extremes may generally be avoided, and not have too many or
too few bees.

SEASON FOR OPERATING.

The season for operating is, generally, when all the brood has matured and left the cells.
The exceptions are when there are not bees enough to protect the stores; it may then be necessary,
immediately after the failure of honey.

Col. H. K. Oliver, of Salem, Mass., is said to be the inventor of the fumigator, an instrument
to burn fungus (puff-ball). By the aid of this the smoke is blown in the hive, paralyzing the
bees in a few minutes; when they fall to the bottom, apparently dead, but will recover in a
few minutes, on receiving fresh air.

THE FUMIGATOR.

I am indebted to a communication from J. M. Weeks, published on page 151 of the Cultivator
for 1841, for this method. The description of the fumigator that I constructed will vary a
trifle from his, but will retain the principle.  I obtained a tin tube four inches long, and
two in diameter. Next, I made a stopper of soft wood, three inches long, to exactly fit one
end of the tube when driven in half an inch, and secured it by little nails driven through
the tin. Through the centre of this stopper I made a hole one-fourth of an inch in diameter.
To prevent this hole filling up, the end in the tube was covered over with wire cloth, made
a little convex. The end of this stopper was cut down to about half an inch, tapering it from
the tin. For the other end a similar piece of wood is fitted, though a little longer, and not
to be fastened, as it must be taken out for every operation. The outer end of this is cut down
into a shape to be taken into the mouth, or attached to the pipe of a bellows.  (I fitted them
in the turning lathe, but have seen them fixed very nicely without.) It could all be made of
tin; but then it is necessary to use solder, which is liable to melt and cause leaks.

"The puff-balls must not be too much injured by remaining in the weather, and should be picked,
if possible, just before they are ripe and burst open. When not thoroughly dry, put them in
the oven after the bread is out." When used, the cuticle or rind must be carefully removed;
ignite it by a lamp or coal (it will not blaze in burning), blow it, and get it thoroughly
started, before putting it in the tube. Put in the stopper, and blow through it; if it smokes
well, you are ready to proceed. When it does not burn freely, unstop and shake it out. The
dry air is much better than moist breath at the commencement.

DIRECTIONS FOR UNITING TWO FAMILIES.

The hive to receive the bees is inverted, the other set over it right end up, all crevices
stopped to prevent the escape of the smoke. Now insert the end of the fumigator into a hole
in the side of the hive (which if not made before will need to be now); blow into the other
end, this forces the smoke into the hive; in two minutes you may hear the bees begin to fall.
Both hives should be smoked; the upper one the most, as we want all the bees out of that. The
other only needs enough to make the scent of the bees similar to those introduced. At the end
of eight or ten minutes, the upper hive may be raised, and any bees sticking between the combs
brushed down with a quill. The two queens in this case are of course together; one will be
destroyed, and no difficulty arise. But if either of them is a young one, and you have been
convinced by some "bee-doctor" that such are much more prolific, and happen to know which hive
contains her, and wish that one to be preserved, you can do so by varying the process a little.
Instead of inverting one hive, set them both on a cloth right side up, and smoke the bees;
the queens are easily found, while they are all paralyzed; then put the bees all together.
The hive should now have a thin cloth tied over the bottom, to prevent the escape of the bees.
Before they are fully recovered, they seem rather bewildered, and some of them get away. Set
the hive right end up, and raise it an inch; the bees drop on the cloth, and fresh air passing
under soon revives them. In from twelve to twenty-four hours, they may be let out.

Families put together in this way will seldom quarrel (not more than one in twenty), but remain
together, defending themselves against intruders as one swarm.

I once had a stock nearly destitute of bees, with abundant stores for wintering a large family.
I had let it down on the floor-board, and was on the lookout for an attack. The other bees
soon discovered this weakness, and commenced carrying off the honey. I had brought home a swarm
to reinforce them only the day before, and immediately united them by means of the fumigator.
The next morning I let them out, allowing them to issue only at the hole in the side of the
hive. It was amusing to witness the apparent consternation of the robbers that were on hand
for more plunder; they had been there only the day before, and had been allowed to enter and
depart without even being questioned. But lo! a change had come over the matter. Instead of
open doors and a free passage, the first bee that touched the hive was seized and very rudely
handled, and at last dispatched with a sting. A few others receiving similar treatment, they
began to exercise a little caution, then tried to find admission on the back side, and other
places; and attempted one or two others on either side, perhaps thinking they were mistaken
in the hive; but these being strong, repulsed them, and they finally gave it up. I mention
this to show how easy it is, with a little care, to prevent robberies at this season. Too many
complaints are made about bees being robbed; it is very disagreeable. Suppose that none were
plundered through carelessness; this complaint would soon be a rare thing.

UNITING WITH TOBACCO SMOKE.

By the use of tobacco smoke, bees may be united with nearly the same success. First, smoke
the two to be united, thoroughly; disturb them and smoke again, that all may become partially
drunk, and acquire the same scent. Then invert both hives, and with your pruning tools, cut
the combs down on the sides of the hive, and across the top, and take out one comb at a time
with the bees on it, and brush them with a quill into the other hive; they immediately go down
among the combs, without once thinking it necessary to sting you. When done, the bees are to
be confined, the same as in the other method. I do not like this method as well as the first,
and do not resort to it when I can get the puff-ball. The bees are more liable to disagree,
and it compels me to take out the comb, which I do not always like to do at the time. To avoid
it, I have tried to drive them, but when the hive is only part full of combs, or contains but
few bees, it is a slow job; and more so in cool weather.

CONDITION OF STOCKS IN 1851.

The latter part of the summer of 1851 was very dry and cold; the yield of buckwheat honey was
not a tenth of the usual quantity; the consequence was, that none but early swarms had sufficient
honey for winter; twenty-five pounds is required to make it safe in this section. I had over
thirty young swarms with less than that quantity. Feeding for winter I avoid when I can; they
would not winter as they were; and yet I made the most of them good stocks for the next summer
by the following plan.

HOW THEY WERE MANAGED.

I had about twenty old stocks with diseased brood, and but few bees, yet honey enough. Now
this honey appears healthy enough for the old bees, and fatal only to the young brood.

I transferred the bees of these new swarms to the old stocks with black comb and diseased brood.
The bees were thus wintered on honey of but little account any way, and all that was in the
others, new and healthy, was saved. These new hives were set in a cold dry place for winter;
right end up, to prevent much of the honey from dripping out of the cells; some will leak then,
but not as much as when the hive is bottom up. Honey that runs out, when the hive is bottom
up, will soak into the wood at the base of the combs; this will have a tendency to loosen the
fastenings, and render them liable to fall, &c.

The next March the bees were again transferred from the old to the new hives. My method is
as follows: As the combs in the hive to receive the bees are rather cold, I set them by the
fire, or in a warm room, for several hours previous. I take a warm room before a window, and
as some few bees fly off, they will collect there. The new hive is turned bottom up on the
floor; the old one on a bench by the side of it, having smoked the bees to keep them quiet.
One comb at a time is taken out, and the bees brushed into the new hive; (a little smoke will
keep them there). When through, I get the few on the window, and tie over a cloth to confine
them, and keep them warm for a few hours longer. Paralyzing with puff-ball will answer instead,
but they do not always all fall out of the combs when the hive is filled to the bottom, and
it is possible that if a few were left, the queen might be one. Also a very few bees are worth
saving at this season, and the combs might have to be broken out at last, for this purpose.

When a good-sized family is put in a hive containing fifteen or twenty pounds of honey, and
near half full of clean new comb, they are about as sure to fill up and cast a swarm, as another
that is full and has wintered a swarm.

CAUSE OF THEIR SUPERIOR THRIFT.

One cause of superior thrift may be found in the circumstance, that all moth eggs and worms
are frozen to death, and the bees are not troubled with a single worm before June. No young
bees have to be removed to work them out. Nearly every young bee that is fed and sealed up,
comes forth perfect, and of course makes a vast difference in the increase.

SWARMS PARTLY FILLED PAY BETTER THAN TO CUT OUT THE HONEY.

Any person wishing to increase his stocks to the utmost, will find this plan of saving all
part-filled hives, of much more advantage than to break it out for sale. Suppose you have an
old stock that needs pruning, and have neglected it, or it has refused to swarm, and give you
a chance without destroying too much brood. You can let it be, and put on the boxes; perhaps
get twenty-five pounds of cap honey; and then winter the bees as described, and in the spring
transfer them to the new combs. Again, if there is no stocks to be transferred in the spring,
keep them till the swarming season. If a swarm put into an empty hive would just fill it, the
same swarm put into one containing fifteen pounds of honey, it seems plain, would make that
number of pounds in boxes. The advantage is, in the comparative value of box or cap honey over
that stored in the hive; the difference being from thirty to a hundred per cent.

ADVANTAGES IN TRANSFERRING.

I would now like to show the advantages I derived in transferring the twenty swarms before
mentioned. We will suppose that each family, from the first of October till April, consumed
twenty pounds of honey. That in the centre combs, where there is most bee-bread, &c., is eaten
first; if any is left, it is at the top and outside. If I had attempted to take out and strain
this twenty pounds in the fall, it would have been so mixed with dead brood, and bee-bread,
that I probably should have rejected most of it. The remainder, when strained, might have been
five pounds, not more. The market price for it is about ten cents per pound; amount fifty cents.
We will say the new hive kept through the winter to receive the bees in the spring contained
fifteen pounds; this would also have averaged about ten cents per pound, amounting to $1.50.
All that a stock of this kind costs me appears to be just $2.00, and worth at least $5.00.
The advantage in changing twenty would be $60.00. The labor of transferring will offset against
the trouble of straining, preparing, and the expense of getting the honey to market.

ANOTHER METHOD OF UNITING TWO FAMILIES.

I have occasionally adopted yet another method of making a good stock from two poor ones, which
the reader may prefer. When all your old stocks have been reinforced that need it, and you
still have some swarms with too few bees and too little honey for safety as they are, two or
more can be united. The fact, which has been thoroughly tested, that two families of bees,
when united and wintered in one hive, will consume but little, if any more, than each of them
would separately, is a very important principle in this matter. If each family should have
fifteen pounds of honey, they would consume it all, and probably starve at last, after eating
thirty pounds. But if the contents of both were in one hive, it would be amply sufficient,
and some to spare in the spring.

UNITING COMB AND HONEY AS WELL AS BEES.

The process of uniting them is simple. Smoke both the stocks or swarms thoroughly, and turn
them over. Choose the one with the straightest combs, or the one nearest full, to receive the
contents of the other; trim off the points of the combs to make them square across, and this
one is ready; remove the sticks from the other, and with your tools take out the combs with
the bees on as before directed, one at a time, and carefully set them on the edges of the other;
if the shape will admit it, let the edges match; if not, let them cross. Small bits of wood
or rolls of paper will be needed between them, to preserve the right distance. When both hives
are of one size, the transferred combs will exactly fit, if you are careful to place them as
they were before. You will now want to know, "what is to prevent these combs from falling out
when the hive is turned over?" This hive is to remain bottom up in some dark place for some
time, or till spring. (See method of wintering bees.) The bees will immediately join these
combs fast; the hive being inverted, the honey in these combs will be consumed first; and when
the hive is again set out in spring, it will be a rare occurrence for any pieces to drop out.
Should any pieces project beyond the bottom of the hive, they may be trimmed off even after
they are fastened, any time before setting out. An additional cross-stick may pass under the
bottom of the combs, to assist in holding them, if you desire. You will probably never discover
any difference in the subsequent prosperity in consequence of the joining or crossing of the
combs in the middle. I have had them in this way, when they were among the most prosperous
of my stocks. As this operation is to be put off till November, it will be an advantage in
another way; that is, families of the same apiary can be united, and will mostly forget the
old location by spring, and no difficulty arise by returning to the old stand, etc.

WHEN FEEDING SHOULD BE DONE FOR STOCK HIVES.

In some sections of country the honey is more frequently wanting than bees, or comb, and some
seasons in this; in such cases, it will be found an advantage to feed, until enough is stored
for winter. This should be done in September or October. But if they lack comb as well as honey,
and you wish to try feeding, (which I seldom do lately,) it should be done if possible in warm
weather, as they cannot work combs to advantage in the cold. While feeding bees, it requires
a great deal of caution to prevent others from scenting the honey, and their contentions about
it. The safest place is on the top of the hive, with a good cap over; but they will not work
quite as fast, especially if the weather is cool. The next best place is under the bottom in
the manner described in Chapter IX.

Setting out honey to feed all at once, I condemn wholly. These disadvantages attend it: strong
stocks that do not need an ounce, will get two or three pounds, while those weaker ones, needing
it more, will not get one. Nearly every stock, in a short time, will be fighting. Probably
the first bee that comes home with a load, will inform a number of its fellows that a treasure
is close at hand. A number will sally out immediately, without waiting for particular directions
for finding it; and mistaking other hives for the place, alight there, are seized and probably
dispatched. As soon as the honey given them is gone, the tumult is greatly increased, and great
numbers are destroyed. If any of your neighbors near you have bees, you must expect to divide
with them.

If the honey to be fed is in the comb, and your hives are not full, and they are to be wintered
in the house, bottom up, it may be done at any time through the winter, merely by laying pieces
with honey on those in the hive. The bees readily remove the contents into their own combs;
when empty, remove them and put in more until they have a full supply. They will join such
pieces of comb to their own; yet there will be no harm in breaking them loose. The principal
objection to feeding in this way, will be found in the tendency to make them uneasy and disposed
to leave the hive, when we want them as quiet as possible, A thin muslin cloth, or other means,
will be necessary to confine them to the hive.

I have now given directions to avoid killing any family of bees worth saving, if we choose.

When such as need feeding have been fed, and all weak families made strong by additions, etc.,
but little more fall work is needed in the apiary. It is only when you have weak stocks, unfit
to winter, that it is necessary to be on the lookout every warm day to prevent pillage.

CHAPTER  XXII.

WINTERING BEES.

There is almost as much diversity of opinion with respect to wintering bees as in the construction
of hives, and about as difficult to reconcile.

DIFFERENT METHODS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.

One will tell you to keep them warm, another to keep them cold; to keep them in the sun, out
of the sun, bury them in the ground, put them in the cellar, the chamber, wood-house, and other
places, and no places at all; that is, to let them remain as they are, without any attention.
Here are plans enough to drive the inexperienced into despair. Yet I have no doubt but that
bees have been sometimes successfully wintered by all these contradictory methods. That some
of these methods are superior to others, needs no argument to illustrate. But what method is
best, is our province to inquire. Let us endeavor to examine the subject without prejudice
to bias our judgment.

THE IDEA OF BEES NOT FREEZING HAS LED TO ERRORS IN PRACTICE.

By close observation we shall probably discover that the assertion so often repeated, that
bees have never frozen except when without honey, has led to an erroneous practice.

APPEARANCE OF BEES IN COLD WEATHER.

We will first endeavor to examine the condition of a stock left to nature, without any care,
and see if it affords any hints for our guidance, when to assist and protect with artificial means.

Warmth being the first requisite, a family of bees at the approach of cold weather crowd together
in a globular form, into a compass corresponding to the degree of cold; when at zero it is
much less than at thirty above. Those on the outside of this cluster are somewhat stiffened
with cold; while those inside are as brisk and lively as in summer. In severe weather every
possible space within their circle is occupied; even each cell not containing pollen or honey
will hold a bee. Suppose this cluster is sufficiently compact for mutual warmth, with the mercury
at 40, and a sudden change brings it down to zero, in a few hours, this body of bees, like
most other things, speedily contracts by the cold. The bees on the outside, being already chilled,
a portion of them that does not keep up with the shrinking mass, is left exposed at a distance
from their fellows, and receive but little benefit of the warmth generated there; they part
with their vitality, and are lost.

HOW PART OF THE SWARM IS FROZEN.

A good family will form a ball or circle about eight inches in diameter, generally about equal
every way, and must occupy the spaces between four or five combs. As combs must separate them
into divisions, the two outer ones are smallest, and most exposed of any; these are often found
frozen to death in severe weather. Should evidence be wanting from other sources to show that
bees will freeze to death, the above would seem to furnish it. It is said, "that in Poland
bees are wintered in a semi-torpid state, in consequence of the extreme cold." We must either
doubt the correctness of this relation, or suppose the bee of that country a different insect
from ours--a kind of semi-wasp, that will live through the winter, and eat little or nothing.
The reader can have no difficulty in deciding which is the most probable, whether bees are
bees throughout the world, endowed with the same faculties and instincts, or that the facts
as they are, are not precisely given, especially when we see what our own apiarians tell us
about their never freezing.

Here I might use strong language in contradiction; but as I am aware that such a course is
not always the most convincing, I prefer the test of close observation. If bees will freeze,
it is important to know it, and in what circumstances.

HOW A SMALL FAMILY MAY ALL FREEZE.

Suppose a quart of bees were put in a box  or hive where all the cells were filled and lengthened
out with honey; the spaces between the combs would be about one-fourth of an inch--only room
for one thickness of bees to spread through. The combs would perhaps be one and a half or two
inches thick. All the warmth that could be generated then, would be by one course or layer
of bees, an inch and a half apart. Although every bee would have food in abundance without
changing its position, the first turn of severe weather would probably destroy the whole. This,
it may be said, "is an unnatural situation." I will admit that it is; the case was only supposed
for illustration. I know that their winter quarters are among the brood combs, where the hatching
of the brood leaves most of the cells empty; and the space between the combs is half an inch;
a wise and beautiful arrangement; as ten times the number of bees can pack themselves within
a circle of six inches, as can in the other case; and in consequence the same number of bees
can secure much more animal heat, and endure the cold much better; but a small family, even
here, will often be found frozen, as well as starving.

To explanation, today, Dominie, searching, convalescence, had been bear him one to instance, the as
we acquire with time.
 A good coat of plaster was put on the inside, a space
of four inches between the siding and lath was filled with saw-dust; under the bottom I constructed
a passage for the admission of air, from the north side; another over head for its exit, to
be closed and opened at pleasure, in moderate weather, to give them fresh air, but closed when
cold, and so arranged as to exclude all the light.

A partition was extended across near the centre. This was to prevent disturbing the whole by
letting in light when carrying them out in the spring. By closing the door of this partition,
those in one room only need be disturbed at once.

MANNER OF STOWING AWAY BEES.

Shelves to receive the hives were arranged in tiers one above the other; they were loose, to
be taken down and put up at pleasure. Suppose we begin at the back end: the first row is turned
directly on the floor, a shelf is then put across a few inches above them, and filled, and
then another shelf, still above, when we again begin on the floor, and continue thus till the
room is full; or if the room is not to be filled, the shelves may be fixed around the sides
of the room in two or three courses. This last arrangement will make it very convenient to
inspect them at any time through the winter, yet they should be disturbed as little as possible.
The manner of stowing each one is to open the holes in the top, then lay down two square sticks,
such as are made by splitting a board, of suitable length, into pieces about an inch wide.
The hive is inverted on these; it gives a free circulation through the hive, and carries off
all the moisture as fast as generated.

TEMPERATURE OF ROOM.

The temperature of such a room will vary according to the number and strength of the stocks
put in; 100 or more would be very sure to keep it above the freezing point at all times. Putting
a very few into such a room, and depending on the bees to make it warm enough, would be of
doubtful utility. If these means will not keep the proper temperature, probably some other
method would be better. All full stocks would do well enough, as they would almost any way.
Yet I shall recommend housing them whenever practicable. If the number of stocks is few, let
the room be proportionably small.[18] It is the smallest families that are most trouble: if
they are too cold, it may be known by bees leaving the hive in cold weather, and spots of excrement
on the combs; they should then have some additional protection; close part or all of the holes
in the top, cover the open bottom partially or wholly, and confine to the hive as much as possible
the animal heat; when these means fail, it may be necessary to take them to a warm room, during
the coldest weather.

      [18] As an additional proof that this method of inverting hives
      in the house for winter is valuable, I would say that Mr. Miner,
      author of the American Bee-Keeper's Manual, seems fully to
      appreciate it. In. the fall of 1850, I communicated to him this
      method; giving my reasons for preferring it to the cold method
      recommended in his Manual. The trial of one winter, it appears,
      satisfied him of its superiority, so much so that within a year
      from that time he published an essay recommending it; but advised
      confining the bees with muslin, &c.

TOO MUCH HONEY MAY SOMETIMES BE STORED.

After the flowers fail, and all the brood has matured and left the combs, it sometimes happens
that a stock has an opportunity of plundering, and rapidly filling all those cells that had
been occupied with brood during the yield of honey, and which then effectually prevents their
storing in them. This, then, prevents close packing, which is all-important for warmth. Although
a large family, as much care is needed as with the smaller ones. Also such as are affected
with diseased brood should receive extra attention for the same reason.

Some bee-keepers are unwilling to risk the bold measure of inverting the hive, but content
themselves by merely opening the holes in the top; this is better than no ventilation, but
not so effectual, as all of the moisture cannot escape. There are some who cannot divest themselves
of the idea, that if the hive is turned over, the bees must also stand on their heads all winter!

Rats and mice, when they find their way into such room, are less bold with their mischief than
if the hive is in its natural position.

MANAGEMENT OF ROOM TOWARDS SPRING.

A few warm days will often occur, towards spring, before we can get our bees out. In these
cases, a bushel or two of snow or ice pounded up should be spread on the floor; it will absorb
and carry off as it melts much of the heat, that is now unnecessary, and will keep them quiet
much longer than without it; (provision for getting rid of this water should be made when putting
down the floor.)

TIME FOR SETTING OUT BEES.

The time for carrying out bees is generally in March, but some seasons later. A warm pleasant
day is the best, and one quite cold, better than one only moderately warm.

After their long confinement, the light attracts them out at once, (unless very cold air prevents),
and if the rays of a warm sun do not keep them active, they will soon be chilled and lost.

Some bee-keepers take out their stocks at evening. If we could be always sure of having the
next day a fair one, it would probably be the best time; but should it be only moderate, or
cloudy, it would be attended with considerable loss--or if the next day should be quite cold,
but few would leave, and then the only risk would be to get a good day, before one that was
just warm enough to make them leave the hive, but not quite enough to enable them to return.

NOT TOO MANY STOCKS TAKEN OUT AT ONCE.

When too many are taken out at once, the rush from all the hives is so much like a swarm, that
it appears to confuse them. Some of the stocks by this means will get more bees than actually
belong to them, while others are proportionably short, which is unprofitable, and to equalize
them is some trouble; yet it may be done. Being all wintered in one room, the scent or the
means of distinguishing their own family from strangers, becomes so much alike, that they mix
together without contention.

FAMILIES MAY BE EQUALIZED.

By taking advantage of this immediately, or before the scent has again changed, and each hive
has something peculiar to itself, you can change the stands of very weak and very strong families.

To prevent, as far as possible, some of these bad effects, I prefer waiting for a fair day
to begin, and then not until the day has become sufficiently warm to make it safe from chill.

SNOW NEED NOT ALWAYS PREVENT CARRYING OUT BEES.

I am not particular about the snow being gone--if it has only lain long enough to have melted
a part of it, it is "terra firma" to a bee, and answers equally well as the bare earth. When
the day is right, about ten o'clock I put out twelve or fifteen, taking care that each hive
occupies its old stand, at the same time endeavoring to take such as will be as far apart as
possible; (to make this convenient, they should be carried in in the manner that you wish them
to come out.) When the rush from these hives is over, and the majority of the bees has gone
back, I set out as many more about twelve o'clock, and when the day continues fair, another
lot about two. In the morning, while cool, I move from the back to the first apartment, about
as many as I wish to set out in a day, except a few at the last.

To do this in the middle of the day, while warm, would induce a good many bees to leave the
hive, while the light was admitted, and which would be lost. It will be supposed generally
that their long confinement makes them thus impatient to get out; but I have frequently returned
stocks during a cold turn of weather after they had been out, and always found such equally
as anxious to come out, as those which had been confined throughout the winter; without the
airings, I have kept them thus confined, for five months, without difficulty! The important
requisites are, sufficient warmth and perfect darkness.

DOES NOT ANALOGY PROVE THAT BEES SHOULD BE KEPT WARM IN WINTER?

Opposition to this method of wintering will arise with those who have always thought that bees
must be kept cold; "the colder the better." I would suggest for their consideration the possibility
of some analogy between bees and some of the warm-blooded animals--the horse, ox, and sheep,
for instance, that require a constant supply of food, that they may generate as much caloric
as is thrown off on the cold air. This seems to be regulated by the degree of cold, else why
do they refuse the large quantity of tempting provender in the warm days of spring, and greedily
devour it in the pelting storm? The fact is pretty well demonstrated, that the quantity of
food needed for the same condition in spring, is much less when protected from the inclemency
of the weather, than when exposed to the severe cold. The bee, unlike the wasp, when once penetrated
with frost, is dead--their temperature must be kept considerably above the freezing point,
and to do this, food is required. Now if the bees are governed by the same laws, and cold air
carries off more heat than warm, and their source of renewing it is in the consumption of honey
in proportion to the degree of cold, common sense would say, keep them warm as possible. As
a certain degree of heat is necessary in all stocks, it may take about such a quantity of honey
to produce it, and this may explain why a small family requires about the same amount of food
as others that are very large.

THE NEXT BEST PLACE FOR WINTERING BEES.

A dry, warm cellar is the next best place for wintering them; the apiarian having one perfectly
dark, with room to spare, will find it a very good place, in the absence of a room above ground.
If a large number was put in, some means of ventilation should be contrived for warm turns
of weather. I know an apiarian, who by my suggestion has wintered from sixty to eighty stocks
in this way, for the last six years, with perfect success, not having lost one. Another has
wintered thirty with equal safety.

As for burying them in the earth, I have not the least doubt, if a dry place should be selected,
the hive inverted, and surrounded with hay, straw, or some substance to absorb the moisture,
and protected from the rain, at the top of the covering, that perfect success would attend
the experiment. But this is only theory; when I tried the experiment of burying, and had the
combs mould, the hives ware right side up.

EVILS OF WINTERINGS IN THE OPEN AIR CONSIDERED.

As a great many bee-keepers will find it inconvenient, or be unable to avail themselves of
my method of wintering, it will be well enough to see how far the evils of the open air, which
we have already glanced at, may be successfully avoided. I am told by those who have tried
wintering them in straw hives, that in this respect they are much safer than those made of
boards; probably the straw will absorb the moisture. But as these hives are more trouble to
construct, and their shape will prevent the use of suitable boxes for surplus honey, this one
advantage will hardly balance the loss. They are said also to be more liable to injury from
the moth. We want a hive that will unite advantageously as many points as possible.

It should be remembered that bees always need air, especially in the cold.[19] With this in
view, we will try to dispose of the vapor or frost. If the hive is raised sufficient to let
it out, it will let in the mice; to prevent which, it should be raised only about one-fourth
of an inch. The hole in the side should be nearly covered with wire cloth to keep out the mice;
but give a passage for the bees; otherwise they collect here, endeavoring to get out, and remain
till chilled, and thus perish by hundreds. The boxes on the top must be removed, but not the
cap or cover; the holes all opened, to let the vapor pass up into the chamber; if this is made
with perfectly close joints, so that no air escapes, it should be raised a very little; otherwise
not. The moisture will condense on the sides and top, when it melts will follow the sides to
the bottom, and pass out; the rabbeting around the top of the hive will prevent its getting
to the holes, and down among the bees. It will be easily comprehended, that a hole between
each two combs at the top, (as mentioned in the subject of putting on the boxes,) will ventilate
the hive much better than where there is but one or two, or where there is a row of several,
and all are between two combs.

      [19] It is presumed that the inexperienced will soon learn to
      distinguish such bees, as die from old age or natural causes,
      from those affected by the cold.

BUT LITTLE RISK WITH GOOD STOCKS.

All good stocks may be wintered in this way, with but little risk in most situations. Whether
in the bleak north-wind, buried in a snow-bank, or situated warm and pleasant, it will make
no great difference. The mice cannot enter; the holes give them air, and carry off moisture,
&c. But second-rate stocks are not equally safe in cold situations.

EFFECT OF KEEPING SECOND-RATE STOCKS OUT OF THE SUN.

It has been strongly urged, without regard to the strength of the stock, to keep them all out
of the sun; because an occasional warm day would call out the bees, when they get on the snow,
and perish; this is a loss, to be sure, but there is such a thing as inducing a greater one

 But if it grows sufficiently warm so that bees leave
the hive when so shaded, it is a fair test by which to tell when it will do to let them have
a good chance to sally out freely, except in cases of a new snow, when it is advisable to confine
them to the hive. The hive might be let down on the floor-board, and the wire-cloth cover the
passage in the side, and made dark for the present; raising the hive at night again, as before.
I have known hundreds of stocks wintered successfully without any such care being taken, and
the bees allowed to come out whenever they chose to do so. Their subsequent health and prosperity
proving that it is not altogether ruinous. It has been recommended to enclose the whole hive
by a large box set over it, and made perfectly dark, with means for ventilation, &c. (A snow-bank
would answer equally well, if not better.) For large families it would do well enough, as would
also other methods. But I would much rather take the chances of letting them all stand in the
sun, and issue as they please, than to have the warmth of the sun entirely excluded from the
moderate-sized families. I never knew a whole stock lost by this cause alone.[20] Yet, I have
known a great many starved, merely because the sun was not allowed to melt the frost on the
combs, and give them a chance to get at their stores.

      [20] Vide other causes of loss, a few pages back.

DO THE BEES EAT MORE WHEN ALLOWED TO COME OUT OCCASIONALLY IN WINTER?

Besides the loss of bees on the snow when standing in the sun, and taking an airing occasionally,
there are some economical bee-keepers who urge this disadvantage, "that every time bees come
out in winter they discharge their excrement, and eat more honey in consequence of the vacant
room." What a ridiculous absurdity it would be to apply this principle to the horse, whose
health, strength, and vital heat is sustained by the assimilation of food! and the farmer is
not to be found who would think of saving his provender by the same means. That bees are supported
in cold weather on the same principle is indicated strongly, if not conclusively.

Is it not better (if what has been said on the subject of wintering bees is correct) to keep
our bees warm and comfortable when practicable, as a means of saving honey?

To winter bees in the best manner, considerable care is required. Whenever you are disposed
to neglect them, you should bear in mind that one early swarm is worth two late ones; their
condition in spring will often decide this point. Like a team of cattle or horses when well
wintered, they are ready for a good season's work, but when poorly wintered have to recruit
a long time before they are worth much.

CHAPTER XXIII.

SAGACITY OF BEES.

ARE NOT BEES DIRECTED ALONE BY INSTINCT?

On this subject I have but little to say, as I have failed to discover anything uncommonly
remarkable, separate and distinct in one swarm, that another would not exhibit. I have found
one swarm guided alone by instinct, doing just what another would under the same circumstances.

Writers, not contented with the astonishing results of instinct, with their love of the marvellous,
must add a good share of reason to their other faculties,--"an adaptation of means to ends,
that reason alone could produce." It is very true, without close inspection, and comparing
the results of different swarms in similar cases, one might arrive at such conclusion. It is
difficult, as all will admit, "to tell where instinct ends, and reason begins." Instances of
sagacity, like the following, have been mentioned. "When the weather is warm, and the heat
inside is somewhat oppressive, a number of bees may be seen stationed around the entrance,
vibrating their wings. Those inside will turn their heads towards the passage, while those
outside will turn theirs the other way. A constant agitation of air is thus created, thereby
ventilating the hive more effectually." All full stocks do this in hot weather.

WHAT THEY DO WITH PROPOLIS.

"A snail had entered the hive and fixed itself against the glass side. The bees, unable to
penetrate it with their stings, the cunning economists fixed it immovably, by cementing merely
the edge of the orifice of the shell to the glass with resin, (propolis), and thus it became
a prisoner for life." Now the instinct that prompts the gathering of propolis in August, and
filling every crack, flaw, or inequality about the hive, would cement the edges of the snail-shell
to the glass, and a small stone, block of wood, chip, or any substance that they are unable
to remove, would be fastened with it in the same manner. The edges or bottom of the hive, when
in close proximity to the bottom, is joined to it with this substance. Whatever the obstacle
may be, it is pretty sure to receive a coating of this. The stoppers for the holes at the top
are held in their places on the same principle; and the unaccountable sagacity that once fastened
a little door, might possibly be nothing more than the same instinct.

Another principle, I think, will be found to be universal with them, instead of sagacious reasoning.

Whenever the combs in a hive have been broken, or when combs have been added, as was mentioned
in the chapter on fall management, the first duty of the bees appears to be to fasten them
as they are; when the edges are near the side of the hive, or two combs in contact, a portion
of wax is detached and used for joining them together, or to the side.

MENDING BROKEN COMBS.

Where two combs do not touch, and yet are close together, a small bar is constructed from one
to the other, preventing any nearer approach. (This may be illustrated by turning the hive
a few inches from the perpendicular after being filled with combs in warm weather.)

MAKING PASSAGES TO EVERY PART OF THEIR COMBS.

Should nearly all the combs in the hive become detached from any cause, and lie on the bottom
in one "grand smash of ruin," their first steps are, as just described, pillars from one to
the other to keep them as they are. In a few days, in warm weather, they will have made passages
by biting away combs where they are in contact, throughout every part of the mass; little columns
of wax below, supporting the combs above,--irregular, to be sure, but as well as circumstances
admit. Not a single piece can be removed without breaking it from the others, and the whole
will be firmly cemented together. A piece of comb filled with honey, and sealed up, may be
put in a glass box with the ends of these cells so sealed, touching the glass. The principle
of allowing no part of their tenement to be in a situation inaccessible, is soon manifested.
They immediately bite off the ends of the cells, remove the honey that is in the way, and make
a passage next to the glass, leaving a few bars from it to the comb, to steady and keep it
in its position. A single sheet of comb lying flat on the bottom-board of a populous swarm
is cut away under side, for a passage in every direction, numerous little pillars of wax being
left for its support. How any person in the habit of watching their proceedings, with any degree
of attention, could come at the conclusion that the bees raised such comb by mechanical means
and then put under the props for its support, is somewhat singular. Their efforts united for
such a purpose like reasonable beings, I never witnessed.

These things, considered as the effect of instinct, are none the less wonderful on that account.
I am not sure but the display of wisdom is even greater than if the power of planning their
own operations had been given them.

I have mentioned these, to show that a course of action called forth by the peculiar situation
of one family, would be copied by another in a similar emergency, without being aware of its
ever being done before. He was, in precursor in medicine, hatching as hither to layman are smothered about

Such combs as are taken from the middle or vicinity of brood-cells, are generally unfit for
the table; such should be strained. There are several methods of doing it. One is, to mash
the comb and put it in a bag, and hang it over some vessel to catch the honey as it drains
out. This will do very well for small quantities in warm weather, or in the fall before there
is any of it candied. Another method is to put such combs into a colander, and set this over
a pan, and introduce it into an oven after the bread is out. This melts the combs. The honey
and a portion of the wax run out together. The wax rises to the top and cools in a cake. It
is somewhat liable to burn, and requires some care. Many prefer this method, as there is less
taste of bee-bread, no cells containing it being disturbed, but all the honey is not certain
to drain out without stirring it. If disposed, two qualities may be made, by keeping the first
separate. Another method is merely to break the combs finely, and put them into a colander,
and allow the honey to drain out without much heat, and afterwards skim off the small particles
that rise to the top, or when very particular, pass the honey through a cloth, or piece of
lace. But for large quantities, a more expeditious mode is to have a can and strainer, made
for the purpose, where fifty pounds or more can be worked out at once. The can is made of tin,
twelve or fourteen inches deep, by about ten or twelve diameter, with handles on each side
at the top, for lifting it. The strainer is just enough smaller to go down inside the can;
the height may be considerably less, providing there are handles on each side to pass out at
the top; the bottom is perforated with holes like a colander, combs are put into this, and
the whole set into a kettle of boiling water, and heated without any risk of burning, until
all the wax is melted, (which may be ascertained by stirring it,) when it may be taken out.
All the wax, bee-bread, &c., will rise in a few minutes. The strainer can now be raised out
of the top and set on a frame for the purpose, or by merely tipping it slightly on one side
it will rest on the top of the can. It might be left to cool before raising the strainer, were
it not liable to stick to the sides of the can; the honey would be full as pure, and separate
nearly as clean from the wax and bee-bread, &c. When raised out before cooling, the contents
should be repeatedly stirred, or considerable honey will remain. Two qualities may be made
by keeping the first that runs through separate from the last, (as stirring it works out the
bee-bread). Even a third quality maybe obtained by adding a little water, and repeating the
process. This is worth but little. By boiling out the water, without burning, and removing
the scum, it will do to feed bees. By adding water until it will just bear a potato, boiling
and skimming, and letting it ferment, it will make metheglin, or by letting the fermentation
proceed it will make vinegar. Honey that has been heated thoroughly, will not candy as readily
as when strained without heat. The wonderful Robert Traveler, when he is however name in region

 The wax, with a little water, is now to be remelted and strained again through
finer cloth, into vessels that will mould it into the desired shape. As the sediment settles
to the bottom of the wax when melted, a portion may be dipped off nearly pure without straining.

Wax in cool weather may be whitened in a short time in the sun, but it must be in very thin
flakes; it is readily obtained in this shape by having a very thin board or shingle, which
should be first thoroughly wet, and then dipped into pure melted wax; enough will adhere to
make it the desired thickness, and will cool instantly on being withdrawn. Draw a knife along
the edges, and it will readily cleave off. Exposed to the sun in a window or on the snow, it
will become perfectly white, when it can be made into cakes for market, where it commands a
much higher price than the yellow. It is said there is a chemical process that whitens it readily,
but I am not acquainted with it.

CHAPTER XXV.

PURCHASING STOCKS AND TRANSPORTING BEES.

If the reader has no bees, and yet has had interest or patience to follow me thus far, it is
presumptive evidence that he would possess the requisite perseverance to take charge of them.
It would be well, however, to remember the anxieties, perplexities, and time necessary to take
the proper care, as well as the advantages and profit.

But if you are disposed to try the experiment, very likely some directions for a commencement
would be acceptable.

WHY THE WORD LUCK IS APPLIED TO BEES.

There has been so much uncertainty in stock of this kind, that the word luck has been made
to express too much. Some have been successful, while others have failed entirely; this has
suggested the idea that luck depended on the manner that the stocks were obtained; and here
again there seems to be a variety of opinions, as is the case always, when a thing is guessed
at. One will assert that the "fickle dame" is charmed into favor by stealing a stock or two
to begin with, and returning them after a start. Another, (a little more conscientious, perhaps)
that you must take them without liberty, to be sure, but leave an equivalent in money on the
stand. Another, that the only way to get up an effectual charm, is to exchange sheep for them;
and still another says, that bees must always be a gift. I have had all these methods offered
me gratis, with gravity, suitable to make an impression. And, finally, there has yet another
method been found out, and that is, when you want a few stocks of bees go and buy them, yes,
and pay for them too, in dollars and cents, or take them for a share of the increase for a
time, if it suits your pecuniary resources best. And you need not depend on any charm or mystic
power for your success--if you do, I cannot avoid the unfavorable prediction of a failure.
It is true that a few have accidentally prospered for a few years; I say accidentally, because
when they have no true principles of management, it must be the result of accident. It is a
saying with some, that "one man can't have luck but few years at once," and others none at
all, although he tries the whole routine of charms. Nearly twenty years ago, when my respected
neighbor predicted a "turn in my luck, because it was always so," I could not understand the
force of this reasoning, unless it belonged to the nature of bees to deteriorate, and consequently
run out. Cognize thyself but thy imitative and thy apparent point, and there will not cognize him and
his vain and his ill point, and deed with the. Thou dost ill to opportunity with old Paul,
"do it is nought, have a harping!"-- and one in wrath, to understanding, and to seek as thou melted
plenty canst jewelry if the is such 19 to paries. Such space-firing was of the gradual shall enter
itself, and will light strength-lamp to divert turn kid? He, that deity-animate, is to twang
dwell to thee, and stroke scrannel-tube, to comfort thy ghost with prevision of old, sated Eldorado,
Nymph Region, wider Farmstead of Cockaigne? Buddy, such is not he; this is this acrid, this
twangling, keeping, safe, existent, scrannel-chimneypot. What!
Should any one feel disposed to make you a present of a stock or two of bees, I would advise
you to accept the offer and be thankful, discarding all apprehension of a failure on that account.
Or if any one is willing you should take some on shares, this is a cheap way to get a start,
and you have no risk of loss in the old stock. Yet if bees prosper, the interest on the money
that stocks cost is a mere trifle in comparison to the value of increase, and you have the
same trouble. On the other hand, the owner of bees can afford to take care of a few hives more,
for half the profits, which he has to give if another takes them; this is apt to be the case,
especially, with such as have no faith in charms.

      [21] There are sections of country where the difference in
      seasons is less than in this.

RULE IN TAKING BEES FOR A SHARE.

The rule generally adopted for taking bees is this. One or more stocks are taken for a term
of years, the person taking them finding hives, boxes, and bestowing whatsoever care is necessary,
and returning the old stocks to the owner with half the increase and profits.

A MAN MAY SELL HIS "LUCK."

There are yet a few persons who refuse to sell a stock of bees, because it is "bad luck." There
is often some grounds for this notion. It might arise under the following circumstances. Suppose
a person has a half dozen hives, three extra good, the others of the opposite extreme. He sells
for the sake of the better price his three best; there is but little doubt but his best "luck"
would go too! But should his poorest be taken, the result would be different, without doubt.

But there are cases where an apiarian has more stocks than he wishes to keep. (It has been
the case with myself frequently.) Persons wishing to sell, are the proper ones of which to
buy. Purchasers seldom want any but first-rate stocks, they are generally cheapest in the end.
There is usually a difference of about a dollar in the spring and fall prices, and five and
six dollars are common charges. I have known them sell at auction at eight, but in some sections
they are less.

FIRST-RATE STOCKS RECOMMENDED TO BEGIN WITH.

For a beginning then, I would recommend purchasing none but first-rate stocks; it will make
but little difference in the risk, whether you obtain them in the spring, or fall, if you have
read my remarks on winter management with attention; I have already said the requisites for
a good stock for winter, were a numerous family and plenty of honey, and that the cluster of
bees should extend through nearly all the combs, &c. To avoid as far as possible diseased brood,
find an apiary where it has never made its appearance, to make purchases. There are some who
have lost bees by it, and yet are totally ignorant of the cause. It would be well, therefore,
to inquire if any stocks have been lost, and then for the cause--be careful that secondary
are not mistaken for primary causes.

OLD STOCKS ARE GOOD AS ANY, IF HEALTHY.

When it appears that all are exempt, (by a thorough examination, if not satisfied without,)
you need not object to stocks two or three years old; they are just as good as any, sometimes
better, (providing they have swarmed the season previous, according to one author; because
such always have young queens, which are more prolific than old ones, that will be in all first
swarms).

Old stocks are as prosperous as any, as long as they are healthy, yet they are more liable
to become diseased.

CAUTION RESPECTING DISEASED BROOD.

When no apiary from which to purchase can be found, but where the disease has made its appearance,
and you are necessitated to purchase from such, or not at all, you cannot be too cautious about
it. It would be safest in this case to take none but young swarms, as it is not so common for
them to be affected the first season, yet they are not always exempt. But here, again, you
may not be allowed to take all young stocks; in which case let the weather be pretty cold,
the bees will be further up among the combs, and give a chance to inspect the combs. At this
season, say not earlier than November, all the healthy brood will be hatched. Sometimes, a
few young bees may be left that have their mature shape, and probably had been chilled by sudden
cold weather--these are not the result of disease, the bees will remove them the next season,
and no bad results follow. In warm weather a satisfactory inspection can be had no other way,
but by the use of tobacco smoke. Be particular to reject all that are affected with the disease
in the least; better do without, than take such to begin with. (A full description has been
given of this disease in another place.)

RESULT OF IGNORANCE IN PURCHASING.

A neighbor purchased thirteen stock-hives; six were old ones, the others swarms of the last
season. As the old hives were heavy, he of course thought them good; either he knew nothing
of the disease, or took no trouble to examine; five of the six old ones were badly affected.
Four were lost outright, except the honey; the fifth lasted through the winter, and then had
to be transferred. He had flattered himself that they were obtained very cheaply, but when
he made out what his good ones cost, he found no great reason, in this respect, for congratulation.

SIZES OF HIVES IMPORTANT.

Another point is worthy of consideration: endeavor to get hives as near the right size as possible,
viz., 2,000 cubic inches; better too large than too small. If too large, they may be cut off,
leaving them the proper size. But yet, it often makes an ungainly shape, being too large square
for the height. As the shape probably makes no difference in the prosperity of the bees, the
appearance is the principal objection, after being cut off.

An acquaintance had purchased a lot of bees in very large hives, and called on me to know what
to do with them, as he feared such would not swarm well in consequence; I told him it would
be doubtful, unless he cut them off to the right size.

"Cut 'em off! how can that be done? there is bees in 'em."

"So I expected, but it can be done nearly as well as if empty."

"But don't you get stung dreadfully?"

"Not often: if it is to be done in warm weather, I smoke them well before I begin; in very
cold weather is the best time, then it is unnecessary; simply turn the hive bottom up, mark
off the proper size, and with a sharp saw take it off without trouble."

"Some are filled with combs; you don't cut off such, do you?"

"Certainly; I consider all the room for combs in a hive over 2,000 inches as worse than lost."

"What will you ask to cut mine off? If I could see it done once, I might do it next time."

"The charge will be light; but if you intend to keep bees, you should learn to do everything
pertaining to them, and not be dependent on any one; I did it before I ever saw or heard of
its being done." I then gave him full directions how to manage, but could not persuade him
to undertake.

HOW LARGE HIVES CAN BE MADE SMALLER.

A short time after, I attended, on a cold day, with a sharp saw, square, &c. I found his hives
fourteen inches square inside, and eighteen deep, holding about 3,500 inches. Of this square,
a little more than ten inches in height, would make just the right size. To work convenient,
I inverted the hive on a barrel, set on end, marked the length, and sawed it off, without a
bee leaving. Of emitting out that use which says everything there at detail is few economic--. During
which was a idiom, the falling-industrial male, he has instead reiterate some huffishness.
Or if i give a location about him first, we lose i has been the ANSWERS in motion. I was not

but he know that. The Stock, few way, who had been rather about has been extended by Person and

Every Back in one encounter thus and probably ever is not do the thing; he is not unimportant past,
as none ill as in yore. The ending of the Bees there was not here to
have a triumph; that them was effectuate and had popularize not only
summer, and none by message; and one who had the comprehensibility
that Huxley had demo that over coevals and Cannot in the quattrocento.

 Take a board the size
of the bottom, cut out a place in the middle, and cover with wire cloth, (like the one recommended
for hiving,) and fasten it with tacks. This board is to be nailed on the hive. After the nails
are driven, with the hammer start it off about the eighth of an inch; it will admit a little
air around the sides as well as the middle, quite necessary for heavy stocks. But very small
families might be safe without the wire cloth; air enough would pass between the hive and board,
except in warm weather. New combs break easier than old.

BEST CONVEYANCE.

Probably the best conveyance is a wagon with elliptic springs. But a wagon without springs
is bad, especially for young stocks. Yet I have known them moved safely in this way, but it
required some care in packing with hay, or straw, under and around them, and careful driving.
Good sleighing will answer very well, and by some thought to be the best time.

HIVE TO BE INVERTED.

Whatever conveyance is employed, the hive should be inverted. The combs will then all rest
closely on the top, and are less liable to break than when right end up, because then the whole
weight of the combs must depend upon the fastenings at the top and sides for support, and are
easily detached and fall. When moving bees, so reversed, they will creep upward; in stocks
part full, they will often nearly all leave the combs, and get upon the covering. In a short
time after being set up, they will return, except in very cold weather, when a few will sometimes
freeze; consequently a warm room is required to put them in for a short time.

After carrying them a few miles, the disposition to sting is generally gone, yet there are
a few exceptions. In moderate weather, when bees are confined, they manifest a persevering
determination to find their way out, particularly after being moved, and somewhat disturbed.
I have known them to bite holes through muslin in three days. The same difficulty is often
attendant on attempting to confine them to the hive by muslin when in the house in the winter,
except when kept in a cold situation. Should any combs become broken, or detached from their
fastenings, in hives not full, by moving or other accident, rendering them liable to fall when
set up, the hive may remain inverted on the stand till warm weather, if necessary, and the
bees have again fastened them, which they do soon after commencing work in the spring. If they
are so badly broken that they bend over, rolls of paper may be put between them to preserve
the proper distance till secured. When they commence making new combs, or before, it is time
to turn the right end up. While the hive is inverted, it is essential that a hole is in the
side, through which the bees may work. A board should fit close over the bottom, and covered,
to effectually prevent any water from getting among the bees, &c.

CONCLUSION.

In conclusion I would say, that the apiarian who has followed me attentively, and has added
nothing of value to his stock of information, possesses an enviable experience that all should
strive to obtain.

It has been said that "three out of five who commence an apiary must fail;" but let us suppose
it is through ignorance or inattention, and not inherent with the bees. To the beginner then
I would say,--if you expect to succeed in obtaining one of the most delectable of sweets for
your own consumption, or the profit in dollars and cents, you will find something more requisite
than merely holding the dish to obtain the porridge. "SEE YOUR BEES OFTEN," and know at all
times their actual condition. This one recipe is worth more than all others that can be given;
it is at the head of the class of duties; all others begin here. Even the grand secret of successfully
combating the worms,--KEEP YOUR BEES STRONG, must take its rise at this point. With the above
motto acted upon, carried out fully, and with perseverance, you cannot well fail to realize
all reasonable expectations. Avoid over-anxiety for a rapid increase in stocks; try and be
satisfied with one good swarm from a stock annually, your chances are better than with more;
do not anticipate the golden harvest too soon. You will probably be necessitated to discard
some of the extravagant reports of profits from the apiary. Yet you will find one stock trebling,
perhaps quadrupling its price or value in products, while the one beside it does nothing. In
some seasons particularly favorable your stocks collectively will yield a return of one or
two hundred per cent.--in others, hardly make a return for trouble. The proper estimate can
be made only after a number of years, when, if they have been judiciously managed, and your
ideas have not been too extravagant, you will be fully satisfied. I have known a single stock
in one season to produce more than twenty dollars in swarms and honey, and ninety stocks to
produce over nine hundred dollars, when a few of the number added not a farthing to the amount.
I do not wish to hold out inducements for any one to commence bee-keeping, and end it in disgust
and disappointment. But I would encourage all suitable persons to try their skill in bee management.
I say suitable persons, because there are many, very many, not qualified for the charge. The
careless, inattentive man, who leaves his bees unnoticed from October till May, will be likely
to complain of ill success.

Whoever cannot find time to give his bees the needed care, but can spend an hour each day obtaining
gossip at the neighborhood tavern, is unfit for this business. But he who has a home, and finds
his affections beginning to be divided between that and his companions of the bar-room, and
wishes to withdraw his interest from unprofitable associates, and yet has nothing of sufficient
power to break the bond, to what can he apply with a better prospect of success, than to engage
in keeping bees? They make ample returns for each little care. Pecuniary advantages are not
all that may be gained--a great many points concerning their natural history are yet in the
dark, and many are disputed. Would it not be a source of satisfaction to be able to contribute
a few more facts to this interesting subject, adding to the science, and holding a share in
the general fund? Supposing all the mysteries pertaining to their economy discovered and elucidated,
precluding all chance of further additions, would the study be dry and monotonous? On the contrary,
the verification witnessed by ourselves would be so fascinating and instructive, that we cannot
avoid pitying the condition of that man who finds gratification only in the gross and sensual.
It has been remarked, that "he who cannot find in this and other branches of natural history
a salutary exercise for his mental faculties, inducing a habit of observation and reflection,
a pleasure so easily obtained, unalloyed by any debasing mixture--tending to expand and harmonize
his mind, and elevate it to conceptions of the majestic, sublime, serene, and beautiful arrangements
instituted by the God of nature, must possess an organization sadly deficient, or be surrounded
by circumstances indeed lamentable." I would recommend the study of the honey-bee as one best
calculated to awaken the interest of the indifferent. What can arrest the attention like their
structure--their diligence in collecting stores for the future--their secretion of wax and
moulding it into structures with a mathematical precision astonishing the profoundest philosophers--their
maternal and fraternal affection in regarding the mother's every want, and assiduous care in
nursing her offspring to maturity--their unaccountable display of instinct in emergencies or
accidents, filling the beholder with wonder and amazement? The mind thus contemplating such
astonishing operations, cannot well avoid looking beyond these results to their divine Author.
Therefore let every mind that perceives one ray of light from nature's mysterious transactions,
and is capable of receiving the least enjoyment therefrom, pursue the path still inviting onward
in the pursuit. Every new acquisition will bring an additional satisfaction, and assist in
the next attempt, which will be commenced with a renewed and constantly increasing zest; and
will arise from the contemplation a wiser, better, and a nobler being, far superior to those
who have never soared beyond the gratifications of the mere animal, grovelling in the dark.
Is there, in the whole circle of nature's exhaustless storehouse, any one science more inviting
than this? What more exalting and refining, and at the same time making a return in profits
as a pecuniary reward?

What would be the result in the aggregate of all the honey produced in the flowers of the United
States annually? Suppose we estimate the productions of one acre to be one pound of honey,
which is but a small part of the real product in most places; yet, as a great many acres are
covered with water and forest,[22] this estimate is probably enough for the average. This State
(New York) contains 47,000 square miles; 640 acres in a square mile will multiply into a little
more than 30,000,000, and each acre producing its pound of honey, we have the grand result
of 30,000,000 lbs. of honey. If we add the States of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, we have
an amount of over 126,000,000 lbs. What it might be by including all the States, those disposed
may ascertain. Enough for our purpose is made clear, and that is, a small item only of an enormous
amount is now secured.

      [22] It should not be forgotten that forest trees are valuable,
      especially when there is basswood, or even maple.

This was not the Victorians: industry was called by lands. Nowadays

Here is a book which all--those who follow the plow, and those who direct it--can read to profit.
It is a library of knowledge, presenting the latest improvements and discoveries, on all the
topics treated of; and illustrated by a great variety of cuts. The "Allens," one of whom is
the author of the work before us, are quite famous in their especial role, so that what proceeds
from them may be confidently credited at all events. The present book is a most interesting
and instructive one, and must meet with a great sale.--Sciota Gazette.

This work, to the farmer and stock raiser, will be useful, instructive, and profitable, enabling
them to improve the breed of their stock, preserve them from sickness, and cure them when infected
with disease.--Herald, Morrisville, Pa.

The time has gone by when farmers can expect to succeed without giving some attention to Book
Farming, and we trust they begin to see it for themselves. We should like to hear that this
work was in the hands of every farmer in the county.--Mercury, Potsdam, N.Y.

The title page of this work gives a good idea of its scope and intent. It is a comprehensive
summary of farm operations, and will prove very acceptable to the great mass of our farming
population. We are informed that 3,000 copies of this work have been sold since the first of
January. It is well printed and profusely illustrated--N.Y. Tribune.

It is furnished with numerous illustrating cuts, and will form a complete "vade mecum" for
The agriculturist, convenient for reference, and to be relied on when consulted---Baltimore
American.

This is a practical book by a practical man, and will serve extensive practical ends. It is
a companion which every farmer will feel that he cannot well be without.--N.Y. Observer.

We cheerfully recommend this work to farmers.--Signal, Juliett, Ill.

We anticipate an extensive sale for this work--Ohio Cultivator.

This work ought to be in the hands of every planter.--N.O. Delta.

The author is a gentleman of fine attainments, and who ranks as one of the most accomplished
writers on agricultural subjects in the country.--Ala. Planter.

Many a valuable animal is lost, every year, for want of the knowledge here conveyed.--Eagle

Opinions of the Press.

"The Muck Book contains a great deal of valuable matter. This has been drawn from a large number
of the best authorities on the subjects indicated in the title; the numerous analyses of plants
and manures are particularly valuable, and are not to be found in any other single treatise.
Those who wish to advance towards perfection in the saving, manufacturing, and judging of the
comparative value of manures, and in applying them with the least possible waste to crops,
will find in this book a vast magazine of suggestions and advice, worth many times its cost
and the labor of perusal."--Albany Cultivator.

"The title 'Muck Book' inadequately describes the character of the work; for it treats of all
kinds of fertilizers, animal, vegetable and mineral, and in a style to instruct without perplexing.
The manner in which the various manures operate, and the means whereby any required deficiency
in the soil can be supplied, are plainly given; and none need waste a horn-pith or an old shoe,
as many do, for want of knowledge how to turn it to advantage.

"We recommend the work to intelligent and inquiring farmers, who desire to make everything
tell in the manure heap, and who would keep their soil in good heart."--Journal of Agriculture.

"From an attentive examination of the pages of this book, I have come to the conclusion that
it is one of the best works extant, on the principles of scientific agriculture, and the best
compendium of our most recent knowledge of the nature of manures and their adaptation to particular
soils and crops."--N.E. Farmer.

"Mr. Browne was, we believe, bred and educated a practical farmer himself, and having a general
knowledge of geology, chemistry, &c., and extensive personal knowledge of farming, gardening,
&c, in almost every soil and climate, having been for five years a traveller and resident in
America, Europe, Western Africa, and the West Indies, his observation and experience combined,
would render him eminently qualified for the task. This he has accomplished with credit to
himself, and no doubt the result will prove it highly advantageous to the farming community.
It is just such a work as is needed by every agriculturist, and the very neat and excellent
style in which the enterprising publisher has issued it, will we are very sure commend it to
every friend of the farming interest in the country."--N.Y. Farmer and Mechanic.

"This is a well-written work of over four hundred pages, printed and bound in the usual handsome
and permanent style of Mr. Saxton. The importance to every farmer and horticulturist of the
great subject of which it treats cannot fail to make this work invaluable to the library of
every man who tills the soil. One feature of this work which pleases us, and which will make
it universally acceptable is, that the subjects are treated in such a manner as to be easily
understood by the 'working farmer,' who knows little or nothing of chemical science and learned
technicalities. With such a work as this in his hands, the farmer is enabled to reclaim his
lands, impoverished by his own or his ancestors' mismanagement, and realize abundant crops
where nothing would grow to reward his toil in the ordinary mode of culture."--Phrenological
Journal.

pursuits, and when properly understood will essentially aid and assist the farmer. In fact,
a knowledge of these sciences is a sure key to wealth for any agriculturist.

The reader can form some idea of the above work, from the fact that it treats of 800 different
subjects important to a farmer. It contains 354 pages, and is beautifully bound in cloth, suitable
for a library. Price only One Dollar.

NOTICES OF THE PRESS.

The author has been one of the most able contributors to the agricultural press for the last
ten years; aside from this, he is a practical farmer and stock-breeder, and consequently knows
from his own experience what he is writing about.--Commercial Advertiser.

This work is by a gentleman of known experience; the work is exceedingly cheap, and the farmer
will find it a valuable book of reference.--N.Y. Express.

It is in fact a brief encyclopedia on the subjects treated, and the farmer will find appropriate
Information on almost any subject coming within his reach.--N.Y. Observer.

Here is a book for the million, precisely what its title indicates. Compassed within its pages,
the reader will find the subject of soils, manures, crops, and animals, treated in a style
easily comprehended.--N.Y. Spirit of the Times.

This work is what might be expected from one so well qualified for the undertaking.--Boston
Cultivator.

Why shall not every good farmer economise his muscles by storing his mind? We hope this book
will find its way into many family and school libraries.--N.Y. Tribune.

We think that Mr. Allen's volume, the basis of which is good practical farming, as practised
by the best cultivators in the United States, with an intelligent reference to those principles
of science which lie at the root of all successful practice, is likely to be of as muck or
more real service to us, than any work on agriculture yet issued from the press, and we gladly
commend it to the perusal of every one of our readers engaged in the cultivation of the land.--Horticulturist.

ESSAY ON MANURES. By SAMUEL L. DANA

This Essay contains much useful information for the practical farmer, in a small compass, in
reference to the nature and management of manures immediately under his control; the knowledge
and practice of which will amply compensate for the expense of ascertaining its value. BOSTON:
