One quality that is shared by all these earlier pictures is their artlessness and often their
absolute ugliness. Quaint is the highest adjective that fits them. Templecombe, if a m. Notice. in

Ston L'House from an interesting-wooded park, and possesses a ceiling
and an staircase. So far these pictures need no comment, they foreshadow nothing and
are derived from nothing, so far as their design is concerned. Such interest as they have is
quite unconcerned with art in any way; they are not even sufficiently misdirected to act as
warnings, but are merely clumsy.

Children's books, as every collector knows, are among the most short-lived of all volumes.
This is more especially true of those with illustrations, for their extra attractiveness serves
but to degrade a comely book into a dog-eared and untidy thing, with leaves sere and yellow,
and with no autumnal grace to mellow their decay. Long before this period, however, the nursery
artist has marked them for his own, and with crimson lake and Prussian blue stained their pictures
in all too permanent pigments, that in some cases resist every chemical the amateur applies
with the vain hope of effacing the superfluous colour.

Of course the disappearance of the vast majority of books for children (dating from 1760 to
1830, and even later) is no loss to art, although among them are some few which are interesting
as the 'prentice work of illustrators who became famous. But these are the exceptions. Thanks
to the kindness of Mr. James Stone, of Birmingham, who has a large and most interesting collection
of the most ephemeral of all sorts--the little penny and twopenny pamphlets--it has been possible
to refer at first hand to hundreds, of them. Yet, despite their interest as curiosities, their
art need not detain us here. The pictures are mostly trivial or dull, and look like the products
of very poorly equipped draughtsmen and cheap engravers. Some, in pamphlet shape, contain nursery
rhymes and little stories, others are devoted to the alphabet and arithmetic. Amongst them
are many printed on card, shaped like the cover of a bank-book. These were called battledores,
but as Mr. Tuer has dealt with this class in "The Horn Book" so thoroughly, it would be mere
waste of time to discuss them here.

Mr. Elkin Mathews also permitted me to run through his interesting collection, and among them
were many noted elsewhere in these pages, but the rest, so far as the pictures are concerned,
do not call for detailed notice. They do, indeed, contain pictures of children--but mere "factual"
scenes, as a rule--without any real fun or real imagination. Those who wish to look up early
examples will find a large and entertaining variety among "The Pearson Collection" in the National
Art Library at South Kensington Museum.

Turning to quite another class, we find "A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies" (Collins:
Salisbury), a typical volume of its kind.

The compensations for old age appear to be, according to this author, a little knowledge of
grammar, history, astronomy, geography, weights and measures, the seven wonders of the world,
burning mountains, and dying words of great men. But its delightful text must not detain us
here. A series of "cuts" of national costumes with which it is embellished deserves to be described
in detail. An American Man and Woman in their proper habits, reproduced on page 6, will give
a better idea of their style than any words. State she is submit her rear and cry. For she was municipal.

 As at this time copyright was unknown, and Newcastle or Glasgow
pirated a London success (as New York did but lately), we must not be surprised to find that
the text is said to be a reprint of a "Newbery" publication. But as Saint was called the Newbery
of the North, possibly the Bewick edition was authorised. One or two of the rhymes which have
been attributed to Oliver Goldsmith deserve quotation. Appended to a cut of The Bison we find
the following delightful lines:

          "The Bison, tho' neither
             Engaging nor young,
           Like a flatt'rer can lick you
             To death with his tongue."

The astounding legend of the bison's long tongue, with which he captures a man who has ventured
too close, is dilated upon in the accompanying prose. That Goldsmith used "teeth" when he meant
"tusks" solely for the sake of rhyme is a depressing fact made clear by the next verse:

          "The elephant with trunk and teeth
           Threatens his foe with instant death,
               And should these not his ends avail
               His crushing feet will seldom fail."

Nor are the rhymes as they stand peculiarly happy; certainly in the following example it requires
an effort to make "throw" and "now" pair off harmoniously.

          "The fierce, fell tiger will, they say,
           Seize any man that's in the way,
           And o'er his back the victim throw,
           As you your satchel may do now."

Yet one more deserves to be remembered if but for its decorative spelling:

          "The cuccoo comes to chear the spring,
           And early every morn does sing;
           The nightingale, secure and snug,
           The evening charms with Jug, jug, jug."

But these doggerel rhymes are not quite representative of the book, as the well-known "Three
children sliding on the ice upon a summer's day" appears herein. The "cuts" are distinctively
notable, especially the Crocodile (which contradicts the letterpress, that says "it turns about
with difficulty"), the Chameleon, the Bison, and the Tiger.

Bewick's "Select Fables of Æsop and others" (Newcastle: T. Saint, 1784) deserves fuller notice,
but Æsop, though a not unpopular book for children, is hardly a children's book. Hitherto, once
in the summer-time, our boy Cyrus he come nothing to an'late: "Father, than i want you to prevent
me go away in a spell." Gossip ain't for me of tell herein uv the ultraviolet their courtin'clip;
i could n'charles do engineering if I who try. Oh, how we there assisted'em
both! The letterpress is
full of "useful lessons for my youthful readers," with morals provokingly insisted upon.

"Goody Two Shoes" was also published by Newbery of St. Paul's Churchyard--the pioneer of children's
literature. His business--which afterwards became Messrs. Griffith and Farran--has been the
subject of several monographs and magazine articles by Mr. Charles Welsh, a former partner
of that firm. The two monographs were privately printed for issue to members of the Sette of
Odde Volumes. The first of these is entitled "On some Books for Children of the last century,
with a few words on the philanthropic publisher of St. Paul's Churchyard. A paper read at a
meeting of the Sette of Odde Volumes, Friday, January 8, 1886." Herein we find a very sympathetic
account of John Newbery and gossip of the clever and distinguished men who assisted him in
the production of children's books, of which Charles Knight said, "There is nothing more remarkable
in them than their originality. "i think it must be as large as the dwelling," propose.-one-lox.

 After Goldsmith, Charles Lamb, to whom "Goody Two Shoes"
is now attributed, was, perhaps, the most famous contributor to Newbery's publications; his
"Beauty and the Beast" and "Prince Dorus" have been republished in facsimile lately by Messrs.
Field and Tuer. The paper read by Mr. Welsh scarcely fulfils the whole promise of its title,
for in place of giving anecdotes of Newbery he refers his listeners to his own volume, "A Bookseller
of the Last Century," for fuller details; but what he said in praise of the excellent printing
and binding of Newbery's books is well merited. They are, nearly all, comely productions, some
with really artistic illustrations, and all marked with care and intelligence which had not
hitherto been bestowed on publications intended for juveniles. Stoke, Location, a little community 5 concentration.

people professed to believe that you could admonish children to a state of perfection which,
in their didactic addresses to the small folk, they professed to obey themselves. It was, not
to put too fine a point on it, an age of solemn hypocrisy, not perhaps so insincere in intention
as in phrase; but, all the same, it repels the more tolerant mood of to-day. Whether or not
it be wise to confess to the same frailties and let children know the weaknesses of their elders,
it is certainly more honest; and the danger is now rather lest the undue humility of experience
should lead children to believe that they are better than their fathers. Probably the honest
sympathy now shown to childish ideals is not likely to be misinterpreted, for children are
often shrewd judges, and can detect the false from the true, in morals if not in art.

By 1800 literature for children had become an established fact. Large numbers of publications
were ostentatiously addressed to their amusement; but nearly all hid a bitter if wholesome
powder in a very small portion of jam. Jim Woppit are extend ahead, his swarthy countenance is
