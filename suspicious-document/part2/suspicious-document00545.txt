"No, child," he answered, after a pause. "I saw Alfred, and he said thee was rather taken by
surprise. He thought, perhaps, thee didn't rightly know thy own mind, and it would be better
to wait a little. That is the chief reason why I haven't spoken to thee."

"If Alfred Barton said that, he told thee false," said she. "I knew my own mind, as well then
as now. I said to him that nothing could ever make me his wife."

"Martha!" the Doctor exclaimed, "don't be hasty! If Alfred is a little older"--

"Father!" she interrupted, "never mention this thing again! Thee can neither give me away,

"No, father," said Martha, rising and laying her hand softly upon his arm, "I obeyed the Spirit
in that other matter, as I obey my conscience in this. I took my duty into my own hands, and
considered it in a humble, and, I hope, a pious spirit. I saw that there were innocent needs
of nature, pleasant enjoyments of life, which did not conflict with sincere devotion, and that
I was not called upon to renounce them because others happened to see the world in a different
light. In this sense, thee is not my keeper; I must render an account, not to thee, but to
Him who gave me my soul. Neither is thee the keeper of my heart and its affections. In the
one case and the other my right is equal,--nay, it stands as far above thine as Heaven is above
the earth!"

In the midst of his wrath, Dr. Deane could not help admiring his daughter. Foiled and exasperated
as he was by the sweet, serene, lofty power of her words, they excited a wondering respect
which he found it difficult to hide.

"Ah, Martha!" he said, "thee has a wonderful power, if it were only directed by the true Light!
But now, it only makes the cross heavier. Don't think that I'll ever consent to see thee carry
out thy strange and wicked fancies! Thee must learn to forget this man, Potter, and the sooner
thee begins the easier it will be!"

"Father," she answered, with a sad smile, "I'm sorry thee knows so little of my nature. The
wickedness would be in forgetting. It is very painful to me that we must differ. Where my duty
was wholly owed to thee, I have never delayed to give it; but here it is owed to Gilbert Potter,--owed,
and will be given."

"Enough, Martha!" cried the Doctor, trembling with anger; "don't mention his name again!"

"I will not, except when the same duty requires it to be mentioned. But, father, try to think
less harshly of the name; it will one day be mine!"

She spoke gently and imploringly, with tears in her eyes. The conflict had been, as she said,
very painful; but her course was plain, and she dared not flinch a step at the outset. The
difficulties must be met face to face, and resolutely assailed, if they were ever to be overcome.

Dr. Deane strode up and down the room in silence, with his hands behind his back. Martha stood
by the fire, waiting his further speech, but he did not look at her, and at the end of half
an hour, commanded shortly and sharply, without turning his head,--

"Go to bed!"

"Good-night, father," she said, in her usual clear sweet voice, and quietly left the room.

CHAPTER XXIII.

A CROSS-EXAMINATION.

The story of Gilbert Potter's robbery and marvellous escape from death ran rapidly through
the neighborhood, and coming, as it did, upon the heels of his former adventure, created a
great excitement. He became almost a hero in the minds of the people. It was not their habit
to allow any man to quite assume so lofty a character as that, but they granted to Gilbert
fully as much interest as, in their estimation, any human being ought properly to receive.
Dr. Deane was eagerly questioned, wherever he went; and if his garments could have exhaled
the odors of his feelings, his questioners would have smelled aloes and asafoetida instead
of sweet-marjoram and bergamot. But--in justice to him be it said--he told and retold the story
very correctly; the tide of sympathy ran so high and strong, that he did not venture to stem
it on grounds which could not be publicly explained.

The supposed disgrace of Gilbert's birth seemed to be quite forgotten for the time; and there
was no young man of spirit in the four townships who was not willing to serve under his command.
More volunteers offered, in fact, than could be profitably employed. Sandy Flash was not the
game to be unearthed by a loud, numerous, sweeping hunt; traps, pitfalls, secret and unwearied
following of his many trails, were what was needed. So much time had elapsed that the beginning
must be a conjectural beating of the bushes, and to this end several small companies were organized,
and the country between the Octorara and the Delaware very effectually scoured.

When the various parties reunited, after several days, neither of them brought any positive
intelligence, but all the greater store of guesses and rumors. Three or four suspicious individuals
had been followed and made to give an account of themselves; certain hiding-places, especially
the rocky lairs along the Brandywine and the North Valley-Hill, were carefully examined, and
some traces of occupation, though none very recent, were discovered. Such evidence as there
was seemed to indicate that part of the eastern branch of the Brandywine, between the forks
of the stream and the great Chester Valley, as being the probable retreat of the highwayman,
and a second expedition was at once organized. The Sheriff, with a posse of men from the lower
part of the county, undertook to watch the avenues of escape towards the river.

This new attempt was not more successful, so far as its main object was concerned, but it actually
stumbled upon Sandy Flash's trail, and only failed by giving tongue too soon and following
too impetuously. Gilbert and his men had a tantalizing impression (which later intelligence
proved to have been correct) that the robber was somewhere near them,--buried in the depths
of the very wood they were approaching, dodging behind the next barn as it came into view,
or hidden under dead leaves in some rain-washed gulley. Had they but known, one gloomy afternoon
in late December, that they were riding under the cedar-tree in whose close, cloudy foliage
he was coiled, just above their heads! Had they but guessed who the deaf old woman was, with
her face muffled from the cold, and six cuts of blue yarn in her basket! But detection had
not then become a science, and they were far from suspecting the extent of Sandy Flash's devices
and disguises.

Many of the volunteers finally grew tired of the fruitless chase, and returned home; others
could only spare a few days from their winter labors; but Gilbert Potter, with three or four
faithful and courageous young fellows,--one of whom was Mark Deane,--returned again and again
to the search, and not until the end of December did he confess himself baffled. By this time
all traces of the highwayman were again lost; he seemed to have disappeared from the country.

"I believe Pratt's right," said Mark, as the two issued from the Marlborough woods, on their
return to Kennett Square. "Chester County is too hot to hold him."

"Perhaps so," Gilbert answered, with a gloomy face. He was more keenly disappointed at the
failure than he would then confess, even to Mark. The outrage committed upon him was still
unavenged, and thus his loss, to his proud, sensitive nature, carried a certain shame with
it. Moreover, the loss itself must speedily be replaced. He had half flattered himself with
the hope of capturing not only Sandy Flash, but his plunder; it was hard to forget that, for
a day or two, he had been independent,--hard to stoop again to be a borrower and a debtor!

"What are the county authorities good for?" Mark exclaimed. "Between you and me, the Sheriff's
a reg'lar puddin'-head. I wish you was in his place."

"If Sandy is safe in Jersey, or down on the Eastern Shore, that would do no good. It isn't
enough that he leaves us alone, from this time on; he has a heavy back-score to settle."

"Come to think on it, Gilbert," Mark continued, "isn't it rather queer that you and him should
be thrown together in such ways? There was Barton's fox-chase last spring; then your shootin'
at other, at the Square; and then the robbery on the road. It seems to me as if he picked you
out to follow you, and yet I don't know why."

Gilbert started. Mark's words reawakened the dark, incredible suspicion which Martha Deane
had removed. Again he declared to himself that he would not entertain the thought, but he could
not reject the evidence that there was something more than accident in all these encounters.
If any one besides Sandy Flash were responsible for the last meeting, it must be Alfred Barton.
The latter, therefore, owed him an explanation, and he would demand it.

When they reached the top of the "big hill" north of the Fairthorn farm-house, whence they
looked eastward down the sloping corn-field which had been the scene of the husking-frolic,
Mark turned to Gilbert with an honest blush all over his face, and said,--

"I don't see why you shouldn't know it, Gilbert. I'm sure Sally wouldn't care; you're almost
like a brother to her."

"What?" Gilbert asked, yet with a quick suspicion of the coming intelligence.

"Oh, I guess you know, well enough, old fellow. I asked her that night, and it's all right
between us. What do you say to it, now?"

"Mark, I'm glad of it; I wish you joy, with all my heart!" Gilbert stretched out his hand,
and as he turned and looked squarely into Mark's half-bashful yet wholly happy face, he remembered
Martha's words, at their last interview.

"You are like a brother to me, Mark," he said, "and you shall have my secret. What would you
say if I had done the same thing?"

"No?" Mark exclaimed; "who?"

"Guess!"

"Not--not Martha?"

Gilbert smiled.

"By the Lord! It's the best day's work you've ever done! Gi' me y'r hand ag'in; we'll stand
by each other faster than ever, now!"

When they stopped at Fairthorn's, the significant pressure of Gilbert's hand brought a blush
into Sally's cheek; but when Mark met Martha with his tell-tale face, she answered with a proud
and tender smile.

Gilbert's first business, after his return, was to have a consultation with Miss Betsy Lavender,
who alone knew of the suspicions attaching to Alfred Barton. The spinster had, in the mean
time, made the matter the subject of profound and somewhat painful cogitation. She had ransacked
her richly stored memory of persons and events, until her brain was like a drawer of tumbled
clothes; had spent hours in laborious mental research, becoming so absorbed that she sometimes
gave crooked answers when spoken to, and was haunted with a terrible dread of having thought
aloud; and had questioned the oldest gossips right and left, coming as near the hidden subject
as she dared. When they met, she communicated the result to Gilbert in this wise:

"'T a'n't agreeable for a body to allow they're flummuxed, but if I a'n't, this time, I'm mighty
near onto it. It's like lookin' for a set o' buttons that'll match, in a box full o' tail-ends
o' things. This'n 'd do, and that'n 'd do; but you can't put this'n and that'n together; and
here's got to be square work, everything fittin' tight and hangin' plumb, or it'll be throwed
back onto your hands, and all to be done over ag'in. I dunno when I've done so much head-work
and to no purpose, follerin' here and guessin' there, and nosin' into everything that's past
and gone; and so my opinion is, whether you like it or not, but never mind, all the same, I
can't do no more than give it, that we'd better drop what's past and gone, and look a little
more into these present times!"

"Well, Betsy," said Gilbert, with a stern, determined face, "this is what I shall do. I am
satisfied that Barton is connected, in some way, with Sandy Flash. What it is, or whether the
knowledge will help us, I can't guess; but I shall force Barton to tell me!"

"To tell me. That might do, as far as it goes," she remarked, after a moment's reflection.
"It won't be easy; you'll have to threaten as well as coax, but I guess you can git it out
of him in the long run, and maybe I can help you here, two bein' better than one, if one is
but a sheep's-head."

"I don't see, Betsy, that I need to call on you."

"This way, Gilbert. It's a strong p'int o' law, I've heerd tell, not that I know much o' law,
Goodness knows, nor ever want to, but never mind, it's a strong p'int when there's two witnesses
to a thing,--one to clinch what the t'other drives in; and you must have a show o' law to work
on Alf. Barton, or I'm much mistaken!"

Gilbert reflected a moment. "It can do no harm," he then said; "can you go with me, now?"

"Now's the time! If we only git the light of a farden-candle out o' him, it'll do me a mortal
heap o' good; for with all this rakin' and scrapin' for nothin', I'm like a heart pantin' after
the water-brooks, though a mouth would be more like it, to my thinkin', when a body's so awful
dry as that comes to!"

The two thereupon took the foot-path down through the frozen fields and the dreary timber of
the creek-side, to the Barton farm-house. As they approached the barn, they saw Alfred Barton
sitting on a pile of straw and watching Giles, who was threshing wheat. He seemed a little
surprised at their appearance; but as Gilbert and he had not met since their interview in the
corn-field before the former's departure for Chester, he had no special cause for embarrassment.

"Come into the house," he said, leading the way.

"No," Gilbert answered, "I came here to speak with you privately. Will you walk down the lane?"

"No objection, of course," said Barton, looking from Gilbert to Miss Lavender, with a mixture
of curiosity and uneasiness. "Good news, I hope; got hold of Sandy's tracks, at last?"

"One of them."

"Ah, you don't say so! Where?"

"Here!"

Gilbert stopped and faced Barton. They were below the barn, and out of Giles's hearing.

"Barton," he resumed, "you know what interest I have in the arrest of that man, and you won't
deny my right to demand of you an account of your dealings with him. When did you first make
his acquaintance?"

"I've told you that, already; the matter has been fully talked over between us," Barton answered,
in a petulant tone.

"It has not been fully talked over. I require to know, first of all, precisely when, and under
what circumstances, you and Sandy Flash came together. There is more to come, so let us begin
at the beginning."

"Damme, Gilbert, you were there, and saw as much as I did. How could I know who the cursed
black-whiskered fellow was?"

"But you found it out," Gilbert persisted, "and the manner of your finding it out must be explained."

Barton assumed a bold, insolent manner. "I don't see as that follows," he said. "It has nothing
in the world to do with his robbery of you; and as for Sandy Flash, I wish to the Lord you'd
get hold of him, yourself, instead of trying to make me accountable for his comings and goings!"

"He's tryin' to fly off the handle," Miss Lavender remarked. "I'd drop that part o' the business
a bit, if I was you, and come to the t'other proof."

"What the devil have you to do here?" asked Barton.

"Miss Betsy is here because I asked her," Gilbert said. "Because all that passes between us
may have to be repeated in a court of justice, and two witnesses are better than one!"

He took advantage of the shock which these words produced upon Barton, and repeated to him
the highwayman's declarations, with the inference they might bear if not satisfactorily explained.
"I kept my promise," he added, "and said nothing to any living soul of your request that I
should carry money for you to Chester. Sandy Flash's information, therefore, must have come,
either directly or indirectly, from you."

Barton had listened with open mouth and amazed eyes.

"Why, the man is a devil!" he cried. "I, neither, never said a word of the matter to any living
soul!"

"Did you really send any money?" Gilbert asked.

"That I did! I got it of Joel Ferris, and it happened he was bound for Chester, the very next
day, on his own business; and so, instead of turning it over to me, he just paid it there,
according to my directions. You'll understand, this is between ourselves?"

He darted a sharp, suspicious glance at Miss Betsy Lavender, who gravely nodded her head.

"The difficulty is not yet explained," said Gilbert, "and perhaps you'll now not deny my right
to know something more of your first acquaintance with Sandy Flash?"

"Have it then!" Barton exclaimed, desperately--"and much good may it do you! I thought his
name was Fortune, as much as you did, till nine o'clock that night, when he put a pistol to
my breast in the woods! If you think I'm colloguing with him, why did he rob me under threat
of murder,--money, watch, and everything?"

"Ah-ha!" said Miss Lavender, "and so that's the way your watch has been gittin' mended all
this while? Mainspring broke, as I've heerd say; well, I don't wonder! Gilbert, I guess this
much is true. Alf. Barton'd never live so long without that watch, and that half-peck o' seals,
if he could help it!"

"This, too, may as well be kept to ourselves," Barton suggested. "It isn't agreeable to a man
to have it known that he's been so taken in as I was, and that's just the reason why I kept
it to myself; and, of course, I shouldn't like it to get around."

Gilbert could do no less than accept this part of the story, and it rendered his later surmises
untenable. But the solution which he sought was as far off as ever.

"Barton," he said, after a long pause, "will you do your best to help me in finding out how
Sandy Flash got the knowledge?"

"Only show me a way! The best would be to catch him and get it from his own mouth."

He looked so earnest, so eager, and--as far as the traces of cunning in his face would permit--so
honest, that Gilbert yielded to a sudden impulse, and said,--

"I believe you, Barton. I've done you wrong in my thoughts,--not willingly, for I don't want
to think badly of you or any one else,--but because circumstances seemed to drive me to it.
It would have been better if you had told me of your robbery at the start."

"You're right there, Gilbert! I believe I was an outspoken fellow enough, when I was young,
and all the better for it, but the old man's driven me into a curst way of keeping dark about
everything, and so I go on heaping up trouble for myself."

"Trouble for myself, Alf. Barton," said Miss Lavender, "that's the truest word you've said
this many a day. Murder will out, you know, and so will robbery, and so will--other things.
More o' your doin's is known, not that they're agreeabler, but on the contrary, quite the reverse,
and as full need to be explained, though it don't seem to matter much, yet it may, who can
tell? And now look here, Gilbert; my crow is to be picked, and you've seen the color of it,
but never mind, all the same, since Martha's told the Doctor, it can't make much difference
to you. And this is all between ourselves, you understand?"

The last words were addressed to Barton, with a comical, unconscious imitation of his own manner.
He guessed something of what was coming, though not the whole of it, and again became visibly
uneasy; but he stammered out,--"Yes; oh, yes! of course."

Gilbert could form a tolerably correct idea of the shape and size of Miss Lavender's crow.
He did not feel sure that this was the proper time to have it picked, or even that it should
be picked at all; but he imagined that Miss Lavender had either consulted Martha Deane, or
that she had wise reasons of her own for speaking. He therefore remained silent.

"First and foremost," she resumed, "I'll tell you, Alf. Barton, what we know o' your doin's,
and then it's for you to judge whether we'll know any more. Well, you've been tryin' to git
Martha Deane for a wife, without wantin' her in your heart, but rather the contrary, though
it seems queer enough when a body comes to think of it, but never mind; and your father's druv
you to it; and you were of a cold shiver for fear she'd take you, and yet you want to let on
it a'n't settled betwixt and between you--oh, you needn't chaw your lips and look yaller about
the jaws, it's the Lord's truth; and now answer me this, what do you mean? and maybe you'll
say what right have I got to ask, but never mind, all the same, if I haven't, Gilbert Potter
has, for it's him that Martha Deane has promised to take for a husband!"

It was a day of surprises for Barton. In his astonishment at the last announcement, he took
refuge from the horror of Miss Lavender's first revelations. One thing was settled,--all the
fruits of his painful and laborious plotting were scattered to the winds. Denial was of no
use, but neither could an honest explanation, even if he should force himself to give it, be
of any possible service.

"Gilbert," he asked, "is this true?--about you, I mean."

"Martha Deane and I are engaged, and were already at the time when you addressed her," Gilbert
answered.

"Good heavens! I hadn't the slightest suspicion of it. Well--I don't begrudge you your luck,
and of course I'll draw back, and never say another word, now or ever."

"You wouldn't ha' been comfortable with Martha Deane, anyhow," Miss Lavender grimly remarked.
"'T isn't good to hitch a colt-horse and an old spavined critter in one team. But that's neither
here nor there; you ha'n't told us why you made up to her for a purpose, and kep' on pretendin'
she didn't know her own mind."

"I've promised Gilbert that I won't interfere, and that's enough," said Barton, doggedly.

Miss Lavender was foiled for a moment, but she presently returned to the attack. "I dunno as
it's enough, after what's gone before," she said. "Couldn't you go a step furder, and lend
Gilbert a helpin' hand, whenever and whatever?"

"Betsy!" Gilbert exclaimed.

"Let me alone, lad! I don't speak in Gilbert's name, nor yet in Martha's; only out o' my own
mind. I don't ask you to do anything, but I want to know how it stands with your willin'ness."

"I've offered, more than once, to do him a good turn, if I could; but I guess my help wouldn't
be welcome," Barton answered. The sting of the suspicion rankled in his mind, and Gilbert's
evident aversion sorely wounded his vanity.

"Wouldn't be welcome. Then I'll only say this; maybe I've got it in my power, and 't isn't
sayin' much, for the mouse gnawed the mashes o' the lion's net, to help you to what you're
after, bein' as it isn't Martha, and can't be her money. S'pose I did it o' my own accord,
leavin' you to feel beholden to me, or not, after all's said and done?"

But Alfred Barton was proof against even this assault. He was too dejected to enter, at once,
into a new plot, the issue of which would probably be as fruitless as the others. He had already
accepted a sufficiency of shame, for one day. This last confession, if made, would place his
character in a still grosser and meaner light; while, if withheld, the unexplained motive might
be presented as a partial justification of his course. He had been surprised into damaging
admissions; but here he would take a firm stand.

"You're right so far, Betsy," he said, "that I had a reason--a good reason, it seemed to me,
but I may be mistaken--for what I did. It concerns no one under Heaven but my own self; and
though I don't doubt your willingness to do me a good turn, it would make no difference--you
couldn't help one bit. I've given the thing up, and so let it be!"

There was nothing more to be said, and the two cross-examiners took their departure. As they
descended to the creek, Miss Lavender remarked, as if to herself,--

"No use--it can't be screwed out of him! So there's one cur'osity the less; not that I'm glad
of it, for not knowin' worries more than knowin', whatsoever and whosoever. And I dunno as
I think any the wuss of him for shuttin' his teeth so tight onto it."

Alfred Barton waited until the two had disappeared behind the timber in the bottom. Then he
slowly followed, stealing across the fields and around the stables, to the back-door of the
Unicorn bar-room. It was noticed that, although he drank a good deal that afternoon, his ill-humor
was not, as usual, diminished thereby.

CHAPTER XXIV.

DEB. SMITH TAKES A RESOLUTION.

It was a raw, overcast evening in the early part of January. Away to the west there was a brownish
glimmer in the dark-gray sky, denoting sunset, and from that point there came barely sufficient
light to disclose the prominent features of a wild, dreary, uneven landscape.

The foreground was a rugged clearing in the forest, just where the crest of a high hill began
to slope rapidly down to the Brandywine. The dark meadows, dotted with irregular lakes of ice,
and long, dirty drifts of unmelted snow, but not the stream itself, could be seen. Across the
narrow valley rose a cape, or foreland, of the hills beyond, timbered nearly to the top, and
falling, on either side, into deep lateral glens,--those warm nooks which the first settlers
loved to choose, both from their snug aspect of shelter, and from the cold, sparkling springs
of water which every one of them held in its lap. Back of the summits of all the hills stretched
a rich, rolling upland, cleared and mapped into spacious fields, but showing everywhere an
edge of dark, wintry woods against the darkening sky.

In the midst of this clearing stood a rough cabin, or rather half-cabin, of logs; for the back
of it was formed by a ledge of slaty rocks, some ten or twelve feet in height, which here cropped
out of the hill-side. The raw clay with which the crevices between the logs had been stopped,
had fallen out in many places; the roof of long strips of peeled bark was shrivelled by wind
and sun, and held in its place by stones and heavy branches of trees, and a square tower of
plastered sticks in one corner very imperfectly suggested a chimney. There was no inclosed
patch of vegetable-ground near, no stable, improvised of corn-shocks, for the shelter of cow
or pig, and the habitation seemed not only to be untenanted, but to have been forsaken years
before.

Yet a thin, cautious thread of smoke stole above the rocks, and just as the starless dusk began
to deepen into night, a step was heard, slowly climbing upward through the rustling leaves
and snapping sticks of the forest. A woman's figure, wearily scaling the hill under a load
which almost concealed the upper part of her body, for it consisted of a huge wallet, a rattling
collection of articles tied in a blanket, and two or three bundles slung over her shoulders
with a rope. When at last, panting from the strain, she stood beside the cabin, she shook herself,
and the articles, with the exception of the wallet, tumbled to the ground. The latter she set
down carefully, thrust her arm into one of the ends and drew forth a heavy jug, which she raised
to her mouth. The wind was rising, but its voice among the trees was dull and muffled; now
and then a flake of snow dropped out of the gloom, as if some cowardly, insulting creature
of the air were spitting at the world under cover of the night.

"It's likely to be a good night," the woman muttered, "and he'll be on the way by this time.
I must put things to rights."

She entered the cabin by a narrow door in the southern end. Her first care was to rekindle
the smouldering fire from a store of boughs and dry brushwood piled in one corner. When a little
flame leaped up from the ashes, it revealed an interior bare and dismal enough, yet very cheery
in contrast with the threatening weather outside. The walls were naked logs and rock, the floor
of irregular flat stones, and no furniture remained except some part of a cupboard or dresser,
near the chimney. Two or three short saw-cuts of logs formed as many seats, and the only sign
of a bed was a mass of dry leaves, upon which a blanket had been thrown, in a hollow under
the overhanging base of the rock.

Untying the blanket, the woman drew forth three or four rude cooking utensils, some dried beef
and smoked sausages, and two huge round loaves of bread, and arranged them upon the one or
two remaining shelves of the dresser. Then she seated herself in front of the fire, staring
into the crackling blaze, which she mechanically fed from time to time, muttering brokenly
to herself in the manner of one accustomed to be much alone.

"It was a mean thing, after what I'd said,--my word used to be wuth somethin', but times seems
to ha' changed. If they have, why shouldn't I change with 'em, as well's anybody else? Well,
why need it matter? I've got a bad name.... No, that'll never do! Stick to what you're about,
or you'll be wuthlesser, even, than they says you are!"

She shook her hard fist, and took another pull at the jug.

"It's well I laid in a good lot o' that," she said. "No better company for a lonesome night,
and it'll stop his cussin', I reckon, anyhow. Eh? What's that?"

From the wood came a short, quick yelp, as from some stray dog. She rose, slipped out the door,
and peered into the darkness, which was full of gathering snow. After listening a moment, she
gave a low whistle. It was not answered, but a stealthy step presently approached, and a form,
dividing itself from the gloom, stood at her side.

"All right, Deb?"

"Right as I can make it. I've got meat and drink, and I come straight from the Turk's Head,
and Jim says the Sheriff's gone back to Chester, and there's been nobody out these three days.
Come in and take bite and sup, and then tell me everything."

They entered the cabin. The door was carefully barred, and then Sandy Flash, throwing off a
heavy overcoat, such as the drovers were accustomed to wear, sat down by the fire. His face
was redder than its wont, from cold and exposure, and all its keen, fierce lines were sharp
and hard. As he warmed his feet and hands at the blaze, and watched Deb. Smith while she set
the meat upon the coals, and cut the bread with a heavy hunting-knife, the wary, defiant look
of a hunted animal gradually relaxed, and he said,--

"Faith, Deb., this is better than hidin' in the frost. I believe I'd ha' froze last night,
if I hadn't got down beside an ox for a couple o' hours. It's a dog's life they've led me,
and I've had just about enough of it."

"Then why not give it up, Sandy, for good and all? I'll go out with you to the Backwoods, after--after
things is settled."

"And let 'em brag they frightened me away!" he exclaimed, with an oath. "Not by a long shot,
Deb. I owe 'em a score for this last chase--I'll make the rich men o' Chester County shake
in their shoes, and the officers o' the law, and the Volunteers, damme! before I've done with
'em. When I go away for good, I'll leave somethin' behind me for them to remember me by!"

"Well, never mind; eat a bit--the meat's ready, and see here, Sandy! I carried this all the way."

He seized the jug and took a long draught. "You're a good 'un, Deb.," he said. "A man isn't
half a man when his belly's cold and empty."

He fell to, and ate long and ravenously. Warmed at last, both by fire and fare, and still more
by his frequent potations, he commenced the story of his disguises and escapes, laughing at
times with boisterous self-admiration, swearing brutally and bitterly at others, over the relentless
energy with which he had been pursued. Deb. Smith listened with eager interest, slapping him
upon the back with a force of approval which would have felled an ordinary man, but which Sandy
Flash cheerfully accepted as a caress.

"You see," he said at the close, "after I sneaked between Potter's troop and the Sheriff's,
and got down into the lower corner o' the county, I managed to jump aboard a grain-sloop bound
for Newport, but they were froze in at the mouth o' Christeen; so I went ashore, dodged around
Wilmington, (where I'm rather too well known,) and come up Whitely Creek as a drover from Mar'land.
But from Grove up to here, I've had to look out mighty sharp, takin' nigh onto two days for
what I could go straight through in half a day."

"Well, I guess you're safe here, Sandy," she said; "they'll never think o' lookin' for you
twice't in the same place. Why didn't you send word for me before? You've kep' me a mortal
long time a-waitin', and down on the Woodrow farm would ha' done as well as here."

"It's a little too near that Potter. He'd smell me out as quick as if I was a skunk to windward
of him. Besides, it's time I was pitchin' on a few new holes; we must talk it over together, Deb."

He lifted the jug again to his mouth. Deb. Smith, although she had kept nearly even pace with
him, was not so sensible to the potency of the liquor, and was watching for the proper degree
of mellowness, in order to broach the subject over which she had been secretly brooding since
his arrival.

"First of all, Sandy," she now said, "I want to talk to you about Gilbert Potter. The man's
my friend, and I thought you cared enough about me to let my friends alone."

"So I do, Deb., when they let me alone. I had a right to shoot the fellow, but I let him off
easy, as much for your sake as because he was carryin' another man's money."

"That's not true!" she cried. "It was his own money, every cent of it,--hard-earned money,
meant to pay off his debts; and I can say it because I helped him earn it, mowin' and reapin'
beside him in the harvest-field, thrashin' beside him in the barn, eatin' at his table, and
sleepin' under his roof. I gev him my word he was safe from you, but you've made me out a liar,
with no more thought o' me than if I'd been a stranger or an enemy!"

"Come, Deb., don't get into your tantrums. Potter may be a decent fellow, as men go, for anything
I know, but you're not beholden to him because he treated you like a Christian as you are.
You seem to forgit that he tried to take my life,--that he's hardly yet giv' up huntin' me
like a wild beast! Damn him, if the money was his, which I don't believe, it wouldn't square
accounts between us. You think more o' his money than o' my life, you huzzy!"

"No I don't, Sandy!" she protested, "no I don't. You know me better'n that. What am I here
for, to-night? Have I never helped you, and hid you, and tramped the country for you back and
forth, by day and by night,--and for what? Not for money, but because I'm your wife, whether
or not priest or 'squire has said it. I thought you cared for me, I did, indeed; I thought
you might do one thing to please me!"

There was a quivering motion in the muscles of her hard face; her lips were drawn convulsively,
with an expression which denoted weeping, although no tears came to her eyes.

"Don't be a fool!" Sandy exclaimed. "S'pose you have served me, isn't it somethin' to have
a man to serve? What other husband is there for you in the world, than me,--the only man that
isn't afeard o' your fist? Shoot, hand; of top. O, wash, right is being done all as Gilbert at-time;

There isn't had the water has implore as he have-is so, far? "
 To help thee to this money would only be to encourage thy wicked fancy for the
man. Of course, I can't do it; I wonder thee should expect it of me. I wonder, indeed, thee
should think of taking as a husband one who borrows money of thee almost as soon as he has
spoken his mind!"

For an instant Martha Deane's eyes flashed. "Father!" she cried, "it is not so! Gilbert doesn't
even know my desire to help him. I must ask this of thee, to speak no evil of him in my hearing.
It would only give me unnecessary pain, not shake my faith in his honesty and goodness. I see
thee will not assist me, and so I must endeavor to find whether the thing cannot be done without
thy assistance. In three years more the legacy will be mine, I shall go to Chester, and consult
a lawyer, whether my own note for that time could not be accepted!"

"I can spare thee the trouble," the Doctor said. "In case of thy death before the three years
are out, who is to pay the note? Half the money falls to me, and half to thy uncle Richard.
Thy aunt Martha was wise. It truly seems as if she had foreseen just what has happened, and
meant to baulk thy present rashness. Thee may go to Chester, and welcome, if thee doubts my
word; but unless thee can give positive assurance that thee will be alive in three years' time,
I don't know of any one foolish enough to advance thee money."

The Doctor's words were cruel enough; he might have spared his triumphant, mocking smile. Martha's
heart sank within her, as she recognized her utter helplessness. Not yet, however, would she
give up the sweet hope of bringing aid; for Gilbert's sake she would make another appeal.

"I won't charge thee, father, with being intentionally unkind. It would almost seem, from thy
words, that thee is rather glad than otherwise, because my life is uncertain. If I should die,
would thee not care enough for my memory to pay a debt, the incurring of which brought me peace
and happiness during life? Then, surely, thee would forgive; thy heart is not so hard as thee
would have me believe; thee wishes me happiness, I cannot doubt, but thinks it will come in
thy way, not in mine. Is it not possible to grant me this--only this--and leave everything
else to time?"

Dr. Deane was touched and softened by his daughter's words. Perhaps he might even have yielded
to her entreaty at once, had not a harsh and selfish condition presented itself in a very tempting
form to his mind.

"Martha," he said, "I fancy that thee looks upon this matter of the loan in the light of a
duty, and will allow that thy motives may be weighty to thy own mind. I ask thee to calm thyself,
and consider things clearly. If I grant thy request, I do so against my own judgment, yea,--since
it concerns thy interests,--against my own conscience. This is not a thing to be lightly done,
and if I should yield, I might reasonably expect some little sacrifice of present inclination--yet
all for thy future good--on thy part. I would cheerfully borrow the six hundred dollars for
thee, or make it up from my own means, if need be, to know that the prospect of thy disgrace
was averted. Thee sees no disgrace, I am aware, and pity that it is so; but if thy feeling
for the young man is entirely pure and unselfish, it should be enough to know that thee had
saved him from ruin, without considering thyself bound to him for life."

The Doctor sharply watched his daughter's face while he spoke. She looked up, at first, with
an eager, wondering light of hope in her eyes,--a light that soon died away, and gave place
to a cloudy, troubled expression. Then the blood rose to her cheeks, and her lips assumed the
clear, firm curve which always reflected the decisions of her mind.

"Father," she said, "I see thee has learned how to tempt, as well as threaten. For the sake
of doing a present good, thee would have me bind myself to do a life-long injustice. Thee would
have me take an external duty to balance a violation of the most sacred conscience of my heart.
How little thee knows me! It is not alone that I am necessary to Gilbert Potter's happiness,
but also that he is necessary to mine. Perhaps it is the will of Heaven that so great a bounty
should not come to me too easily, and I must bear, without murmuring, that my own father is
set against me. Thee may try me, if thee desires, for the coming three years, but I can tell
thee as well, now, what the end will be. Why not rather tempt me by offering the money Gilbert
needs, on the condition of my giving up the rest of the legacy to thee? That would be a temptation,
I confess."

"No!" he exclaimed, with rising exasperation, "if thee has hardened thy heart against all my
counsels for thy good, I will at least keep my own conscience free. I will not help thee by
so much as the moving of a finger. All I can do is, to pray that thy stubborn mind may be bent,
and gradually led back to the Light!"

He put away the book, took his cane and broad-brimmed hat, and turned to leave the room. Martha
rose, with a sad but resolute face, and went up-stairs to her chamber.

Miss Betsy Lavender, when she learned all that had been said, on both sides, was thrown into
a state of great agitation and perplexity of mind. She stared at Martha Deane, without seeming
to see her, and muttered from time to time such fragmentary phrases as,--"If I was right-down
sure," or, "It'd only be another weepon tried and throwed away, at the wust."

"What are you thinking of, Betsy?" Martha finally asked.

"Thinkin' of? Well, I can't rightly tell you. It's a bit o' knowledge that come in my way,
once't upon a time, never meanin' to make use of it in all my born days, and I wouldn't now,
only for your two sakes; not that it concerns you a mite; but never mind, there's ten thousand
ways o' workin' on men's minds, and I can't do no more than try my way."

Thereupon Miss Lavender arose, and would have descended to the encounter at once, had not Martha
wisely entreated her to wait a day or two, until the irritation arising from her own interview
had had time to subside in her father's mind.

"It's puttin' me on nettles, now that I mean fast and firm to do it; but you're quite right,
Martha," the spinster said.

Three or four days afterwards she judged the proper time had arrived, and boldly entered the
Doctor's awful presence. "Doctor," she began, "I've come to have a little talk, and it's no
use beatin' about the bush, plainness o' speech bein' one o' my ways; not that folks always
thinks it a virtue, but oftentimes the contrary, and so may you, maybe; but when there's a
worry in a house, it's better, whatsoever and whosoever, to have it come to a head than go
on achin' and achin', like a blind bile!" 

"nay, sahib. It is good. Without water, who of which were a Dishwater, do him might have to hast life

"Nor I, neither," Miss Lavender absently replied, "only it happened that I knowed Eliza Little,--her
that used to live at the Gap, you know,--and just afore she died, that fall the fever was so
bad, and I nussin' her, and not another soul awake in the house, she told me a secret about
your brother's boy, and I must say few men would ha' acted as Henry done, and there's more
'n one mighty beholden to him."

Dr. Deane stretched out his hand as if he would close her mouth. His face was like fire, and
a wild expression of fear and pain shot from his eyes.

"Betsy Lavender," he said, in a hollow voice, "thee is a terrible woman. Thee forces even the
secrets of the dying from them, and brings up knowledge that should be hidden forever. What
can all this avail thee? Why does thee threaten me with appearances, that cannot now be explained,
all the witnesses being dead?"

"Witnesses bein' dead," she repeated. "Are you sorry for that?"

He stared at her in silent consternation.

"Doctor," she said, turning towards him for the first time, "there's no livin' soul that knows,
except you and me, and if I seem hard, I'm no harder than the knowledge in your own heart.
What's the difference, in the sight o' the Lord, between the one that has a bad name and the
one that has a good name? Come, you set yourself up for a Chris'en, and so I ask you whether
you're the one that ought to fling the first stone; whether repentance--and there's that, of
course, for you a'n't a nateral bad man, Doctor, but rather the contrary--oughtn't to be showed
in deeds, to be wuth much! You're set ag'in Martha, and your pride's touched, which I can't
say as I wonder at, all folks havin' pride, me among the rest, not that I've much to be proud
of, Goodness knows; but never mind, don't you talk about Gilbert Potter in that style, leastways
before me!"

During this speech, Dr. Deane had time to reflect. Although aghast at the unexpected revelation,
he had not wholly lost his cunning. It was easy to perceive what Miss Lavender intended to
do with the weapon in her hands, and his aim was to render it powerless.

"Betsy," he said, "there's one thing thee won't deny,--that, if there was a fault, (which I
don't allow), it has been expiated. To make known thy suspicions would bring sorrow and trouble
upon two persons for whom thee professes to feel some attachment; if thee could prove what
thee thinks, it would be a still greater misfortune for them than for me. They are young, and
my time is nearly spent. We all have serious burdens which we must bear alone, and thee mustn't
forget that the same consideration for the opinion of men which keeps thee silent, keeps me
from consenting to Martha's marriage with Gilbert Potter. We are bound alike."

"We're not!" she cried, rising from her seat. "But I see it's no use to talk any more, now.
Perhaps since you know that there's a window in you, and me lookin' in, you'll try and keep
th' inside o' your house in better order. Whether I'll act accordin' to my knowledge or not,
depends on how things turns out, and so sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, or however
it goes!"

With these words she left the room, though foiled, not entirely hopeless.

"It's like buttin' over an old stone-wall," she said to Martha. "The first hit with a rammer
seems to come back onto you, and jars y'r own bones, and may be the next, and the next; and
then little stones git out o' place, and then the wall shakes, and comes down,--and so we've
been a-doin'. I guess I made a crack to-day, but we'll see."

CHAPTER XXVI.

THE LAST OF SANDY FLASH.

The winter crept on, February was drawing to a close, and still Gilbert Potter had not ascertained
whence the money was to be drawn which would relieve him from embarrassment. The few applications
he had made were failures; some of the persons really had no money to invest, and others were
too cautious to trust a man who, as everybody knew, had been unfortunate. In five weeks more
the sum must be made up, or the mortgage would be foreclosed.

Both Mary Potter and her son, in this emergency, seemed to have adopted, by accident or sympathy,
the same policy towards each other,--to cheer and encourage, in every possible way. Gilbert
carefully concealed his humiliation, on returning home from an unsuccessful appeal for a loan,
and his mother veiled her renewed sinking of the heart, as she heard of his failure, under
a cheerful hope of final success, which she did not feel. Both had, in fact, one great consolation
to fall back upon,--she that he had been mercifully saved to her, he that he was beloved by
a noble woman.

All the grain that could be spared and sold placed but little more than a hundred dollars in
Gilbert's hands, and he began seriously to consider whether he should not be obliged to sell
his wagon and team. He had been offered a hundred and fifty dollars, (a very large sum, in
those days,) for Roger, but he would as soon have sold his own right arm. Not even to save
the farm would he have parted with the faithful animal. Mark Deane persisted in increasing
his seventy-five dollars to a hundred, and forcing the loan upon his friend; so one third of
the amount was secure, and there was still hope for the rest.

It is not precisely true that there had been no offer of assistance. There was one, which Gilbert
half-suspected had been instigated by Betsy Lavender. On a Saturday afternoon, as he visited
Kennett Square to have Roger's fore-feet shod, he encountered Alfred Barton at the blacksmith's
shop, on the same errand.

"The man I wanted to see!" cried the latter, as Gilbert dismounted. "Ferris was in Chester
last week, and he saw Chaffey, the constable, you know, that helped catch Sandy; and Chaffey
told him he was sure, from something Sandy let fall, that Deb. Smith had betrayed him out of
revenge, because he robbed you. I want to know how it all hangs together."

Gilbert suddenly recalled Deb. Smith's words, on the day after his escape from the inundation,
and a suspicion of the truth entered his mind for the first time.

"It must have been so!" he exclaimed. "She has been a better friend to me than many people
of better name."

Barton noticed the bitterness of the remark, and possibly drew his own inference from it. He
looked annoyed for a moment, but presently beckoned Gilbert to one side, and said,--

"I don't know whether you've given up your foolish suspicions about me and Sandy; but the trial
comes off next week, and you'll have to be there as a witness, of course, and can satisfy yourself,
if you please, that my explanation was nothing but the truth. I've not felt so jolly in twenty
years, as when I heard that the fellow was really in the jug!"

"I told you I believed your words," Gilbert answered, "and that settles the matter. Perhaps
I shall find out how Sandy learned what you said to me that evening, on the back-porch of the
Unicorn, and if so, I am bound to let you know it."

"See here, Gilbert!" Barton resumed. "Folks say you must borrow the money you lost, or the
mortgage on your farm will be foreclosed. Is that so? and how much money might it be, altogether,
if you don't mind telling?"

"Not so much, if those who have it to lend, had a little faith in me,--some four or five hundred
dollars."

"That ought to be got, without trouble," said Barton. "If I had it by me, I'd lend it to you
in a minute; but you know I borrowed from Ferris myself, and all o' my own is so tied up that
I couldn't move it without the old man getting on my track. I'll tell you what I'll do, though;
I'll indorse your note for a year, if it can be kept a matter between ourselves and the lender.
On account of the old man, you understand."

The offer was evidently made in good faith, and Gilbert hesitated, reluctant to accept it,
and yet unwilling to reject it in a manner that might seem unfriendly.

"Barton," he said at last, "I've never yet failed to meet a money obligation. All my debts,
except this last, have been paid on the day I promised, and it seems a little hard that my
own name, alone, shouldn't be good for as much as I need. Old Fairthorn would give me his indorsement,
but I won't ask for it; and I mean no offence when I say that I'd rather get along without
yours, if I can. It's kind in you to make the offer, and to show that I'm not ungrateful, I'll
beg you to look round among your rich friends and help me to find the loan."

"You're a mighty independent, fellow, Gilbert, but I can't say as I blame you for it. Yes,
I'll look round in a few days, and maybe I'll stumble on the right man by the time I see you
again."

When Gilbert returned home, he communicated this slight prospect of relief to his mother. "Perhaps
I am a little too proud," he said; "but you've always taught me, mother, to be beholden to
no man, if I could help it; and I should feel more uneasy under an obligation to Barton than
to most other men. You know I must go to Chester in a few days, and must wait till I'm called
to testify. There will then be time to look around, and perhaps Mr. Trainer may help me yet."

"You're right, boy!" Mary Potter cried, with flashing eyes. "Keep your pride; it's not of the
mean kind! Don't ask for or take any man's indorsement!"

Two days before the time when Gilbert was summoned to Chester, Deb. Smith made her appearance
at the farm. She entered the barn early one morning, with a bundle in her hand, and dispatched
Sam, whom she found in the stables, to summon his master. She looked old, weather-beaten, and
haggard, and her defiant show of strength was gone.

In betraying Sandy Flash into the hands of justice, she had acted from a fierce impulse, without
reflecting upon the inevitable consequences of the step. Perhaps she did not suspect that she
was also betraying herself, and more than confirming all the worst rumors in regard to her
character. In the universal execration which followed the knowledge of her lawless connection
with Sandy Flash, and her presumed complicity in his crimes, the merit of her service to the
county was lost. The popular mind, knowing nothing of her temptations, struggles, and sufferings,
was harsh, cold, and cruel, and she felt the weight of its verdict as never before. A few persons
of her own ignorant class, who admired her strength and courage in their coarse way, advised
her to hide until the first fury of the storm should be blown over. Thus she exaggerated the
danger, and even felt uncertain of her reception by the very man for whose sake she had done
the deed and accepted the curse.

Gilbert, however, when he saw her worn, anxious face, the eyes, like those of a dumb animal,
lifted to his with an appeal which she knew not how to speak, felt a pang of compassionate
sympathy.

"Deborah!" he said, "you don't look well; come into the house and warm yourself!"

"No!" she cried, "I won't darken your door till you've heerd what I've got to say. Go 'way,
Sam; I want to speak to Mr. Gilbert, alone."

Gilbert made a sign, and Sam sprang down the ladder, to the stables under the threshing-floor.

"Mayhap you've heerd already," she said. "A blotch on a body's name spreads fast and far. Mine
was black enough before, God knows, but they've blackened it more."

"If all I hear is true," Gilbert exclaimed, "you've blackened it for my sake, Deborah. I'm
afraid you thought I blamed you, in some way, for not preventing my loss; but I'm sure you
did what you could to save me from it!"

"Ay, lad, that I did! But the devil seemed to ha' got into him. Awful words passed between
us, and then--the devil got into me, and--you know what follered. He wouldn't believe the money
was your'n, or I don't think he'd ha' took it; he wasn't a bad man at heart, Sandy wasn't,
only stubborn at the wrong times, and brung it onto himself by that. But you know what folks
says about me?"

"I don't care what they say, Deborah!" Gilbert cried. "I know that you are a true and faithful
friend to me, and I've not had so many such in my life that I'm likely to forget what you've
tried to do!"

Her hard, melancholy face became at once eager and tender. She stepped forward, put her hand
on Gilbert's arm, and said, in a hoarse, earnest, excited whisper,--

"Then maybe you'll take it? I was almost afeard to ax you,--I thought you might push me away,
like the rest of 'em; but you'll take it, and that'll seem like a liftin' of the curse! You
won't mind how it was got, will you? I had to git it in that way, because no other was left to me!"

"What do you mean, Deborah?"

"The money, Mr. Gilbert! They allowed me half, though the constables was for thirds, but the
Judge said I'd arned the full half,--God knows, ten thousand times wouldn't pay me!--and I've
got it here, tied up safe. It's your'n, you know, and maybe there a'n't quite enough, but as
fur as it goes; and I'll work out the amount o' the rest, from time to time, if you'll let
me come onto your place!"

Gilbert was powerfully and yet painfully moved. He forgot his detestation of the relation in
which Deb. Smith had stood to the highwayman, in his gratitude for her devotion to himself.
He felt an invincible repugnance towards accepting her share of the reward, even as a loan;
it was "blood-money," and to touch it in any way was to be stained with its color; yet how
should he put aside her kindness without inflicting pain upon her rude nature, made sensitive
at last by abuse, persecution, and remorse?

His face spoke in advance of his lips, and she read its language with wonderful quickness.

"Ah!" she cried, "I mistrusted how it'd be; you don't want to say it right out, but I'll say
it for you! You think the money'd bring you no luck,--maybe a downright curse,--and how can
I say it won't? Ha'n't it cursed me? Sandy said it would, even as your'n follered him. What's
it good for, then? It burns my hands, and them that's clean, won't touch it. There, you damned
devil's-bait,--my arm's sore, and my heart's sore, wi' the weight o' you!"

With these words she flung the cloth, with its bunch of hard silver coins, upon the threshing-floor.
It clashed like the sound of chains. Gilbert saw that she was sorely hurt. Tears of disappointment,
which she vainly strove to hold back, rose to her eyes, as she grimly folded her arms, and
facing him, said,--

"Now, what am I to do?"

"Stay here for the present, Deborah," he answered.

"Eh? A'n't I summonsed? The job I undertook isn't done yet; the wust part's to come! Maybe
they'll let me off from puttin' the rope round his neck, but I a'n't sure o' that!"

"Then come to me afterwards," he said, gently, striving to allay her fierce, self-accusing
mood. "Remember that you always have a home and a shelter with me, whenever you need them.
And I'll take your money," he added, picking it up from the floor,--"take it in trust for you,
until the time shall come when you will be willing to use it. Now go in to my mother."

The woman was softened and consoled by his words. But she still hesitated.

"Maybe she won't--she won't"--

"She will!" Gilbert exclaimed. "But if you doubt, wait here until I come back."

Mary Potter earnestly approved of his decision, to take charge of the money, without making
use of it. A strong, semi-superstitious influence had so entwined itself with her fate, that
she even shrank from help, unless it came in an obviously pure and honorable form. She measured
the fulness of her coming justification by the strict integrity of the means whereby she sought
to deserve it. Deb. Smith, in her new light, was no welcome guest, and with all her coarse
male strength, she was still woman enough to guess the fact; but Mary Potter resolved to think
only that her son had been served and befriended. Keeping that service steadily before her
eyes, she was able to take the outcast's hand, to give her shelter and food, and, better still,
to soothe her with that sweet, unobtrusive consolation which only a woman can bestow,--which
steals by avenues of benevolent cunning into a nature that would repel a direct expression
of sympathy.

The next morning, however, Deb. Smith left the house, saying to Gilbert,--"You won't see me
ag'in, without it may be in Court, till after all's over; and then I may have to ask you to
hide me for awhile. Don't mind what I've said; I've no larnin', and can't always make out the
rights o' things,--and sometimes it seems there's two Sandys, a good 'un and a bad 'un, and
meanin' to punish one, I've ruined 'em both!"

When Gilbert reached Chester, the trial was just about to commence. The little old town on
the Delaware was crowded with curious strangers, not only from all parts of the county, but
even from Philadelphia and the opposite New-Jersey shore. Every one who had been summoned to
testify was beset by an inquisitive circle, and none more so than himself. The Court-house
was packed to suffocation; and the Sheriff, heavily armed, could with difficulty force a way
through the mass. When the clanking of the prisoner's irons was heard, all the pushing, struggling,
murmuring sounds ceased until the redoubtable highwayman stood in the dock.

He looked around the Court-room with his usual defiant air, and no one observed any change
of expression, as his eyes passed rapidly over Deb. Smith's face, or Gilbert Potter's. His
hard red complexion was already beginning to fade in confinement, and his thick hair, formerly
close-cropped for the convenience of disguises, had grown out in not ungraceful locks. He was
decidedly a handsome man, and his bearing seemed to show that he was conscious of the fact.

The trial commenced. To the astonishment of all, and, as it was afterwards reported, against
the advice of his counsel, the prisoner plead guilty to some of the specifications of the indictment,
while he denied others. The Collectors whom he had plundered were then called to the witness-stand,
but the public seemed to manifest less interest in the loss of its own money, than in the few
cases where private individuals had suffered, and waited impatiently for the latter.

Deb. Smith had so long borne the curious gaze of hundreds of eyes, whenever she lifted her
head, that when her turn came, she was able to rise and walk forward without betraying any
emotion. Only when she was confronted with Sandy Flash, and he met her with a wonderfully strange,
serious smile, did she shudder for a moment and hastily turn away. She gave her testimony in
a hard, firm voice, making her statements as brief as possible, and volunteering nothing beyond
what was demanded.

On being dismissed from the stand, she appeared to hesitate. Her eyes wandered over the faces
of the lawyers, the judges, and the jurymen, as if with a dumb appeal, but she did not speak.
Then she turned towards the prisoner, and some words passed between them, which, in the general
movement of curiosity, were only heard by the two or three persons who stood nearest.

"Sandy!" she was reported to have said, "I couldn't help myself; take the curse off o' me!"

"Deb., it's too late," he answered. "It's begun to work, and it'll work itself out!"

Gilbert noticed the feeling of hostility with which Deb. Smith was regarded by the spectators,--a
feeling that threatened to manifest itself in some violent way, when the restraints of the
place should be removed. He therefore took advantage of the great interest with which his own
testimony was heard, to present her character in the light which her services to him shed upon
it. This was a new phase of the story, and produced a general movement of surprise. Sandy Flash,
it was noticed, sitting with his fettered hands upon the rail before him, leaned forward and
listened intently, while an unusual flush deepened upon his cheeks.

The statements, though not strictly in evidence, were permitted by the Court, and they produced
the effect which Gilbert intended. The excitement reached its height when Deb. Smith, ignorant
of rule, suddenly rose and cried out,--

"It's true as Gospel, every word of it! Sandy, do you hear?"

She was removed by the constable, but the people, as they made way, uttered no word of threat
or insult. On the contrary, many eyes rested on her hard, violent, wretched face with an expression
of very genuine compassion.

The trial took its course, and terminated with the result which everybody--even the prisoner
himself--knew to be inevitable. He was pronounced guilty, and duly sentenced to be hanged by
the neck until he was dead.

Gilbert employed the time which he could spare from his attendance at the Court, in endeavoring
to make a new loan, but with no positive success. The most he accomplished was an agreement,
on the part of his creditor, that the foreclosure might be delayed two or three weeks, provided
there was a good prospect of the money being obtained. In ordinary times he would have had
no difficulty; but, as Mr. Trainer had written, the speculation in western lands had seized
upon capitalists, and the amount of money for permanent investment was already greatly diminished.

He was preparing to return home, when Chaffey, the constable, came to him with a message from
Sandy Flash. The latter begged for an interview, and both Judge and Sheriff were anxious that
Gilbert should comply with his wishes, in the hope that a full and complete confession might
be obtained. It was evident that the highwayman had accomplices, but he steadfastly refused
to name them, even with the prospect of having his sentence commuted to imprisonment for life.

Gilbert did not hesitate a moment. There were doubts of his own to be solved,--questions to
be asked, which Sandy Flash could alone answer. He followed the constable to the gloomy, high-walled
jail-building, and was promptly admitted by the Sheriff into the low, dark, heavily barred
cell, wherein the prisoner sat upon a wooden stool, the links of his leg-fetters passed through
a ring in the floor.

Sandy Flash lifted his face to the light, and grinned, but not with his old, mocking expression.
He stretched out his hand which Gilbert took,--hard and cold as the rattling chain at his wrist.
Then, seating himself with a clash upon the floor, he pushed the stool towards his visitor,
and said,--

"Set down, Potter. Limited accommodations, you see. Sheriff, you needn't wait; it's private
business."

The Sheriff locked the iron door behind him, and they were alone.

"Potter," the highwayman began, "you see I'm trapped and done for, and all, it seems, on account
o' that little affair o' your'n. You won't think it means much, now, when I say I was in the
wrong there; but I swear I was! I had no particular spite ag'in Barton, but he's a swell, and
I like to take such fellows down; and I was dead sure you were carryin' his money, as you promised
to."

"Tell me one thing," Gilbert interrupted; "how did you know I promised to take money for him?"

"I knowed it, that's enough; I can give you, word for word, what both o' you said, if you doubt
me."

"Then, as I thought, it was Barton himself!" Gilbert cried.

Sandy Flash burst into a roaring laugh. "Him! Ah-ha! you think we go snacks, eh? Do I look
like a fool? Barton'd give his eye-teeth to put the halter round my neck with his own hands!
No, no, young man; I have ways and ways o' learnin' things that you nor him'll never guess."

His manner, even more than his words, convinced Gilbert Barton was absolved, but the mystery
remained. "You won't deny that you have friends?" he said.

"Maybe," Sandy replied, in a short, rough tone. "That's nothin' to you," he continued; "but
what I've got to say is, whether or no you're a friend to Deb., she thinks you are. Do you
mean to look after her, once't in a while, or are you one o' them that forgits a good turn?"

"I have told her," said Gilbert, "that she shall always have a home and a shelter in my house.
If it's any satisfaction to you, here's my hand on it!"

"I believe you, Potter. Deb.'s done ill by me; she shouldn't ha' bullied me when I was sore
and tetchy, and fagged out with your curst huntin' of me up and down! But I'll do that much
for her and for you. Here; bend your head down; I've got to whisper."

Gilbert leaned his ear to the highwayman's mouth.

"You'll only tell her, you understand?"

Gilbert assented.

"Say to her these words,--don't forgit a single one of 'em!--Thirty steps from the place she
knowed about, behind the two big chestnut-trees, goin' towards the first cedar, and a forked
sassyfrack growin' right over it. What she finds, is your'n."

"Sandy!" Gilbert exclaimed, starting from his listening posture.

"Hush, I say! You know what I mean her to do,--give you your money back. I took a curse with
it, as you said. Maybe that's off o' me, now!"

"It is!" said Gilbert, in a low tone, "and forgiveness--mine and my mother's--in the place
of it. Have you any"--he hesitated to say the words--"any last messages, to her or anybody
else, or anything you would like to have done?"

"Thank ye, no!--unless Deb. can find my black hair and whiskers. Then you may give 'em to Barton,
with my dutiful service."

He laughed at the idea, until his chains rattled.

Gilbert's mind was haunted with the other and darker doubt, and he resolved, in this last interview,
to secure himself against its recurrence. In such an hour he could trust the prisoner's words.

"Sandy," he asked, "have you any children?"

"Not to my knowledge; and I'm glad of it."

"You must know," Gilbert continued, "what the people say about my birth. My mother is bound
from telling me who my father was, and I dare not ask her any questions. Did you ever happen
to know her, in your younger days, or can you remember anything that will help me to discover
his name?"

The highwayman sat silent, meditating, and Gilbert felt that his heart was beginning to beat
painfully fast, as he waited for the answer.

"Yes," said Sandy, at last, "I did know Mary Potter when I was a boy, and she knowed me, under
another name. I may say I liked her, too, in a boy's way, but she was older by three or four
years, and never thought o' lookin' at me. But I can't remember anything more; if I was out
o' this, I'd soon find out for you!"

He looked up with an eager, questioning glance, which Gilbert totally misunderstood. 

Her curiosity asked only had to man across bairn-most psyche of the so, if state
her idiom. A is the man. "you thought't said up to mr, i let it'me said

Teeth was close and was born.
 Martha interrupted.

"But there is none, Dr. Deane," he continued, "and when the time comes, my birth will be shown
to be as honorable as your own, or Mark's."

Dr. Deane was strangely excited at these words. His face colored, and he darted a piercing,
suspicious glance at Gilbert. The latter, however, stood quietly before him, too possessed
by what he had said to notice the Doctor's peculiar expression; but it returned to his memory
afterwards.

"Why," the Doctor at last stammered, "I never heard of this before!"

"No," Gilbert answered, "and I must ask of you not to mention it further, at present. I must
beg you to be patient until my mother is able to declare the truth."

"What keeps her from it?"

"I don't know," Gilbert sadly replied.

"Come!" cried the Doctor, as sternly as ever, "this is rather a likely story! If Potter isn't
thy name, what is?"

"I don't know," Gilbert repeated.

"No; nor no one else! How dare thee address my daughter,--talk of marriage with her,--when
thee don't know thy real name? What name would thee offer to her in exchange for her own? Young
man, I don't believe thee!"

"I do," said Martha, rising and moving to Gilbert's side.

"Martha, go to thy room!" the Doctor cried. "And as for thee, Gilbert Potter, or Gilbert Anything,
I tell thee, once and for all, never speak of this thing again,--at least, until thee can show
a legal name and an honorable birth! Thee has not prejudiced me in thy favor by thy devices,
and it stands to reason that I should forbid thee to see my daughter,--to enter my doors!"

"Dr. Deane," said Gilbert, with sad yet inflexible dignity, "it is impossible, after what you
have said, that I should seek to enter your door, until my words are proved true, and I am
justified in your eyes. The day may come sooner than you think. But I will do nothing secretly;
I won't promise anything to you that I can't promise to myself; and so I tell you, honestly
and above-board, that while I shall not ask Martha to share my life until I can offer her my
true name, I must see her from time to time. I'm not fairly called upon to give up that."

"No, Gilbert," said Martha, who had not yet moved from her place by his side, "it is as necessary
to my happiness as to yours. I will not ask you to come here again; you cannot, and must not,
even for my sake; but when I need your counsel and your sympathy, and there is no other way
left, I will go to you."

"Martha!" Dr. Deane exclaimed; but the word conveys no idea of his wrath and amazement.

"Father," she said, "this is thy house, and it is for thee to direct, here. Within its walls,
I will conduct myself according to thy wishes; I will receive no guest whom thee forbids, and
will even respect thy views in regard to my intercourse with our friends; but unless thee wants
to deprive me of all liberty, and set aside every right of mine as an accountable being, thee
must allow me sometimes to do what both my heart and my conscience command!"

"Is it a woman's place," he angrily asked, "to visit a man?"

"When the two have need of each other, and God has joined their hearts in love and in truth,
and the man is held back from reaching the woman, then it is her place to go to him!"

Never before had Dr. Deane beheld upon his daughter's sweet, gentle face such an expression
of lofty spiritual authority. While her determination really outraged his conventional nature,
he felt that it came from a higher source than his prohibition. He knew that nothing which
he could urge at that moment would have the slightest weight in her mind, and moreover, that
the liberal, independent customs of the neighborhood, as well as the respect of his sect for
professed spiritual guidance, withheld him from any harsh attempt at coercion. He was powerless,
but still inflexible.

As for Martha, what she had said was simply included in what she was resolved to do; the greater
embraced the less. It was a defiance of her father's authority, very painful from the necessity
of its assertion, but rendered inevitable by his course. She knew with what tenacity he would
seize and hold every inch of relinquished ground; she felt, as keenly as Gilbert himself, the
implied insult which he could not resent; and her pride, her sense of justice, and the strong
fidelity of her woman's heart, alike impelled her to stand firm.

"Good-bye, Martha!" Gilbert said, taking her hand "I must wait."

"We wait together, Gilbert!"

CHAPTER XXVIII.

MISS LAVENDER MAKES A GUESS.

There were signs of spring all over the land, and Gilbert resumed his farm-work with the fresh
zest which the sense of complete ownership gave. He found a purchaser for his wagon, sold one
span of horses, and thus had money in hand for all the coming expenses of the year. His days
of hauling, of anxiety, of painful economy, were over; he rejoiced in his fully developed and
recognized manhood, and was cheered by the respect and kindly sympathy of his neighbors.

Meanwhile, the gossip, not only of Kennett, but of Marlborough, Pennsbury, and New-Garden,
was as busy as ever. No subject of country talk equalled in interest the loves of Gilbert Potter
and Martha Deane. Mark, too open-hearted to be intrusted with any secret, was drawn upon wherever
he went, and he revealed more (although he was by no means Martha's confidant) than the public
had any right to know. The idlers at the Unicorn had seen Gilbert enter Dr. Deane's house,
watched his return therefrom, made shrewd notes of the Doctor's manner when he came forth that
evening, and guessed the result of the interview almost as well as if they had been present.

The restoration of Gilbert's plundered money, and his hardly acquired independence as a landholder,
greatly strengthened the hands of his friends. There is no logic so convincing as that of good
luck; in proportion as a man is fortunate (so seems to run the law of the world), he attracts
fortune to him. A good deed would not have helped Gilbert so much in popular estimation, as
this sudden and unexpected release from his threatened difficulties. The blot upon his name
was already growing fainter, and a careful moral arithmetician might have calculated the point
of prosperity at which it would cease to be seen.

Nowhere was the subject discussed with greater interest and excitement than in the Fairthorn
household. Sally, when she first heard the news, loudly protested her unbelief; why, the two
would scarcely speak to each other, she said; she had seen Gilbert turn his back on Martha,
as if he couldn't bear the sight of her; it ought to be, and she would be glad if it was, but
it wasn't!

When, therefore, Mark confirmed the report, and was led on, by degrees, to repeat Gilbert's
own words, Sally rushed out into the kitchen with a vehemence which left half her apron hanging
on the door-handle, torn off from top to bottom in her whirling flight, and announced the fact
to her mother.

Joe, who was present, immediately cried out,--

"O, Sally! now I may tell about Mark, mayn't I?"

Sally seized him by the collar, and pitched him out the kitchen-door. Her face was the color
of fire.

"My gracious, Sally!" exclaimed Mother Fairthorn, in amazement; "what's that for?"

But Sally had already disappeared, and was relating her trouble to Mark, who roared with wicked
laughter, whereupon she nearly cried with vexation.

"Never mind," said he; "the boy's right. I told Gilbert this very afternoon that it was about
time to speak to the old man; and he allowed it was. Come out with me and don't be afeard--I'll
do the talkin'."

Hand in hand they went into the kitchen, Sally blushing and hanging back a little. Farmer Fairthorn
had just come in from the barn, and was warming his hands at the fire. Mother Fairthorn might
have had her suspicions, but it was her nature to wait cheerfully, and say nothing.

"See here, Daddy and Mammy!" said Mark, "have either o' you any objections to Sally and me
bein' a pair?"

Farmer Fairthorn smiled, rubbed his hands together, and turning to his wife, asked,--"What
has Mammy to say to it?"

She looked up at Mark with her kindly eyes, in which twinkled something like a tear, and said,--"I
was guessin' it might turn out so between you two, and if I'd had anything against you, Mark,
I wouldn't ha' let it run on. Be a steady boy, and you'll make Sally a steady woman. She's
had pretty much her own way."

Thereupon Farmer Fairthorn, still rubbing his hands, ventured to remark,--"The girl might ha'
done worse." This was equivalent to a hearty commendation of the match, and Mark so understood
it. Sally kissed her mother, cried a little, caught her gown on a corner of the kitchen-table,
and thus the betrothal was accepted as a family fact. Joe and Jake somewhat disturbed the bliss
of the evening, it is true, by bursting into the room from time to time, staring significantly
at the lovers, and then rushing out again with loud whoops and laughter.

Sally could scarcely await the coming of the next day, to visit Martha Deane. At first she
felt a little piqued that she had not received the news from Martha's own lips, but this feeling
speedily vanished in the sympathy with her friend's trials. She was therefore all the more
astonished at the quiet, composed bearing of the latter. The tears she had expected to shed
were not once drawn upon.

"O, Martha!" she cried, after the first impetuous outburst of feeling,--"to think that it has
all turned out just as I wanted! No, I don't quite mean that; you know I couldn't wish you
to have crosses; but about Gilbert! And it's too bad--Mark has told me dreadful things, but
I hope they're not all true; you don't look like it; and I'm so glad, you can't think!"

Martha smiled, readily untangling Sally's thoughts, and said,--"I mustn't complain, Sally.
Nothing has come to pass that I had not prepared my mind to meet. We will only have to wait
a little longer than you and Mark."

"No you won't!" Sally exclaimed. "I'll make Mark wait, too! And everything must be set right--somebody
must do something! Where's Betsy Lavender?"

"Here!" answered the veritable voice of the spinster, through the open door of the small adjoining
room.

"Gracious, how you frightened me!" cried Sally. "But, Betsy, you seem to be able to help everybody;
why can't you do something for Martha and Gilbert?"

"Martha and Gilbert. That's what I ask myself, nigh onto a hundred times a day, child. But
there's things that takes the finest kind o' wit to see through, and you can't make a bead-purse
out of a sow's-ear, neither jerk Time by the forelock, when there a'n't a hair, as you can
see, to hang on to. I dunno as you'll rightly take my meanin'; but never mind, all the same,
I'm flummuxed, and it's the longest and hardest flummux o' my life!"

Miss Betsy Lavender, it must here be explained, was more profoundly worried than she was willing
to admit. Towards Martha she concealed the real trouble of her mind under the garb of her quaint,
jocular speech, which meant much or little, as one might take it. She had just returned from
one of her social pilgrimages, during which she had heard nothing but the absorbing subject
of gossip. She had been questioned and cross-questioned, entreated by many, as Sally had done,
to do something (for all had great faith in her powers), and warned by a few not to meddle
with what did not concern her. Thus she had come back that morning, annoyed, discomposed, and
more dissatisfied with herself than ever before, to hear Martha's recital of what had taken
place during her absence.

In spite of Martha's steady patience and cheerfulness, Miss Lavender knew that the painful
relation in which she stood to her father would not be assuaged by the lapse of time. She understood
Dr. Deane's nature quite as well as his daughter, and was convinced that, for the present,
neither threats nor persuasions would move his stubborn resistance. According to the judgment
of the world (the older part of it, at least), he had still right on his side. Facts were wanted;
or, rather, the one fact upon which resistance was based must be removed.

With all this trouble, Miss Lavender had a presentiment that there was work for her to do,
if she could only discover what it was. Her faith in her own powers of assistance was somewhat
shaken, and she therefore resolved to say nothing, promise nothing, until she had both hit
upon a plan and carried it into execution.

Two or three days after Sally's visit, on a mild, sunny morning in the beginning of April,
she suddenly announced her intention of visiting the Potter farm-house.

"I ha'n't seen Mary since last fall, you know, Martha," she said; "and I've a mortal longin'
to wish Gilbert joy o' his good luck, and maybe say a word to keep him in good heart about
you. Have you got no message to send by me?"

"Only my love," Martha answered; "and tell him how you left me. He knows I will keep my word;
when I need his counsel, I will go to him."

"If more girls talked and thought that way, us women'd have fairer shakes," Miss Lavender remarked,
as she put on her cloak and pattens.

When she reached the top of the hill overlooking the glen, she noticed fresh furrows in the
field on her left. Clambering through the fence, she waited until the heads of a pair of horses
made their appearance, rising over the verge of the hill. As she conjectured, Gilbert Potter
was behind them, guiding the plough-handle. He was heartily glad to see her, and halted his
team at the corner of the "land."

"I didn't know as you'd speak to me," said she, with assumed grimness. "Maybe you wouldn't,
if I didn't come direct from her. Ah, you needn't look wild; it's only her love, and what's
the use, for you had it already; but never mind, lovyers is never satisfied; and she's chipper
and peart enough, seein' what she has to bear for your sake, but she don't mind that, on the
contrary, quite the reverse, and I'm sure you don't deserve it!"

"Did she tell you what passed between us, the last time?" Gilbert asked.

"The last time. Yes. And jokin' aside, which often means the contrary in my crooked ways o'
talkin', a'n't it about time somethin' was done?"

"What can be done?"

"I dunno," said Miss Lavender, gravely. "You know as well as I do what's in the way, or rather
none of us knows what it is, only where it is; and a thing unbeknown may be big or little;
who can tell? And latterly I've thought, Gilbert, that maybe your mother is in the fix of a
man I've heerd tell on, that fell into a pit, and ketched by the last bush, and hung on, and
hung on, till he could hold on no longer; so he gev himself up to death, shet his eyes and
let go, and lo and behold! the bottom was a matter o' six inches under his feet! Leastways,
everything p'ints to a sort o' skeary fancy bein' mixed up with it, not a thing to laugh at,
I can tell you, but as earnest as sin, for I've seen the likes, and maybe easy to make straight
if you could only look into it yourself; but you think there's no chance o' that?"

"No," said Gilbert. "I've tried once too often, already; I shall not try again."

"Try again," Miss Lavender repeated. "Then why not?"--but here she paused, and seemed to meditate.
The fact was, she had been tempted to ask Gilbert's advice in regard to the plan she was revolving
in her brain. The tone of his voice, however, was discouraging; she saw that he had taken a
firm and gloomy resolution to be silent,--his uneasy air hinted that he desired to avoid further
talk on this point. So, with a mental reprimand of the indiscretion into which her sympathy
with him had nearly betrayed her, she shut her teeth and slightly bit her tongue.

"Well, well," she said; "I hope it'll come out before you're both old and sour with waitin',
that's all! I don't want such true-love as your'n to be like firkin-butter at th' end; for
as fresh, and firm, and well-kep' as you please, it ha'n't got the taste o' the clover and
the sweet-grass; but who knows? I may dance at your weddin', after all, sooner'n I mistrust;
and so I'm goin' down to spend the day with y'r mother!"

She strode over the furrow and across the weedy sod, and Gilbert resumed his ploughing. As
she approached the house, Miss Lavender noticed that the secured ownership of the property
was beginning to express itself in various slight improvements and adornments. The space in
front of the porch was enlarged, and new flower-borders set along the garden-paling; the barn
had received a fresh coat of whitewash, as well as the trunks of the apple-trees, which shone
like white pillars; and there was a bench with bright straw bee-hives under the lilac-bush.
Mary Potter was at work in the garden, sowing her early seeds.

"Well, I do declare!" exclaimed Miss Lavender, after the first cordial greetings were over.
"Seems almost like a different place, things is so snugged up and put to rights."

"Yes," said Mary Potter; "I had hardly the heart, before, to make it everything that we wanted;
and you can't think what a satisfaction I have in it now."

"Yes, I can! Give me the redishes, while you stick in them beets. I've got a good forefinger
for plantin' 'em,--long and stiff; and I can't stand by and see you workin' alone, without
fidgets."

Miss Lavender threw off her cloak and worked with a will. When the gardening was finished,
she continued her assistance in the house, and fully earned her dinner before she sat down
to it. Then she insisted on Mary Potter bringing out her sewing, and giving her something more
to do; it was one of her working-days, she said; she had spent rather an idle winter; and moreover,
she was in such spirits at Gilbert's good fortune, that she couldn't be satisfied without doing
something for him, and to sew up the seams of his new breeches was the very thing! Never had
she been so kind, so cheerful, and so helpful, and Mary Potter's nature warmed into happy content
in her society.

No one should rashly accuse Miss Lavender if there was a little design in this. The task she
had set herself to attempt was both difficult and delicate. She had divided it into two portions,
requiring very different tactics, and was shrewd enough to mask, in every possible way, the
one from which she had most hopes of obtaining a result. She made no reference, at first, to
Gilbert's attachment to Martha Deane, but seemed to be wholly absorbed in the subject of the
farm; then, taking wide sweeps through all varieties of random gossip, preserving a careless,
thoughtless, rattling manner, she stealthily laid her pitfalls for the unsuspecting prey.

"I was over't Warren's t' other day," she said, biting off a thread, "and Becky had jist come
home from Phildelphy. There's new-fashioned bonnets comin' up, she says. She stayed with Allen's,
but who they are I don't know. Laws! now I think on it, Mary, you stayed at Allen's, too, when
you were there!"

"No," said Mary Potter, "it was at--Treadwell's."

"Treadwell's? I thought you told me Allen's. All the same to me, Allen or Treadwell; I don't
know either of 'em. It's a long while since I've been in Phildelphy, and never likely to go
ag'in. I don't fancy trampin' over them hard bricks, though, to be sure, a body sees the fashions;
but what with boxes tumbled in and out o' the stores, and bar'ls rollin', and carts always
goin' by, you're never sure o' y'r neck; and I was sewin' for Clarissa Lee, Jackson that was,
that married a dry goods man, the noisiest place that ever was; you could hardly hear yourself
talk; but a body gets used to it, in Second Street, close't to Market, and were you anywheres
near there?"

"I was in Fourth Street," Mary Potter answered, with a little hesitation. Miss Lavender secretly
noticed her uneasiness, which, she also remarked, arose not from suspicion, but from memory.

"What kind o' buttons are you goin' to have, Mary?" she asked. "Horn splits, and brass cuts
the stuff, and mother o' pearl wears to eternity, but they're so awful dear. Fourth Street,
you said? One street's like another to me, after you get past the corners. I'd always know
Second, though, by the tobacco-shop, with the wild Injun at the door, liftin' his tommyhawk
to skulp you--ugh!--but never mind, all the same, skulp away for what I care, for I a'n't likely
ever to lay eyes on you ag'in!"

Having thus, with perhaps more volubility than was required, covered up the traces of her design,
Miss Lavender cast about how to commence the second and more hopeless attack. It was but scant
intelligence which she had gained, but in that direction she dared not venture further. What
she now proposed to do required more courage and less cunning.

Her manner gradually changed; she allowed lapses of silence to occur, and restricted her gossip
to a much narrower sweep. She dwelt, finally, upon the singular circumstances of Sandy Flash's
robbery of Gilbert, and the restoration of the money.

"Talkin' o' Deb. Smith," she then said, "Mary, do you mind when I was here last harvest, and
the talk we had about Gilbert? I've often thought on it since, and how I guessed right for
once't, for I know the ways o' men, if I am an old maid, and so it's come out as I said, and
a finer couple than they'll make can't be found in the county!"

Mary Potter looked up, with a shadow of the old trouble on her face. "You know all about it,
Betsy, then?" she asked.

"Bless your soul, Mary, everybody knows about it! There's been nothin' else talked about in
the neighborhood for the last three weeks; why, ha'n't Gilbert told you o' what passed between
him and Dr. Deane, and how Martha stood by him as no woman ever stood by a man?"

An expression of painful curiosity, such as shrinks from the knowledge it craves, came into
Mary Potter's eyes. "Gilbert has told me nothing," she said, "since--since that time."

"That time. I won't ask you what time; it's neither here nor there; but you ought to know the
run o' things, when it's common talk." And therewith Miss Lavender began at the beginning,
and never ceased until she had brought the history, in all its particulars, down to that very
day. She did not fail to enlarge on the lively and universal Interest in the fortunes of the
lovers which was manifested by the whole community. Mary Potter's face grew paler and paler
as she spoke, but the tears which some parts of the recital called forth were quenched again,
as it seemed, by flashes of aroused pride.

"Now," Miss Lavender concluded, "you see just how the matter stands. I'm not hard on you, savin'
and exceptin' that facts is hard, which they sometimes are I don't deny; but here we're all
alone with our two selves, and you'll grant I'm a friend, though I may have queer ways o' showin'
it; and why shouldn't I say that all the trouble comes o' Gilbert bearin' your name?"

 Alfred Barton found
himself so curiously excited that he was fain to leave the harness to Giles, and quiet himself
with a pipe or two in the meadow. He would have gone up to the Unicorn for a little stronger
refreshment, but did not dare to venture out of sight of the house. Miss Ann was the perfect
image of Patience in a hay-mow, smiling at his anxiety. The motion of her needles never ceased,
except when she counted the stitches in narrowing.

Towards sunset, Mr. Stacy made his appearance at the barn-door, but his face was a sealed book.

On the morning of that very day, another mysterious incident occurred. Jake Fairthorn had been
sent to Carson's on the old gray mare, on some farm-errand,--perhaps to borrow a pick-axe or
a post-spade. He had returned as far as the Philadelphia road, and was entering the thick wood
on the level before descending to Redley Creek, when he perceived Betsy Lavender leading Gilbert
Potter's bay horse through a gap in the fence, after which she commenced putting up the rails
behind her.

"Why, Miss Betsy! what are you doin'?" cried Jake, spurring up to the spot.

"Boys should speak when they're spoken to, and not come where they're not wanted," she answered,
in a savage tone. "Maybe I'm goin' to hunt bears."

"Oh, please, let me go along!" eagerly cried Jake, who believed in bears.

"Go along! Yes, and be eat up." Miss Lavender looked very much annoyed. Presently, however,
her face became amiable; she took a buckskin purse out of her pocket, selected a small silver
coin, and leaning over the fence, held it out to Jake.

"Here!" she said, "here's a 'levenpenny-bit for you, if you'll be a good boy, and do exackly
as I bid you. Can you keep from gabblin', for two days? Can you hold your tongue and not tell
anybody till day after to-morrow that you seen me here, goin' into the woods?"

"Why, that's easy as nothin'!" cried Jake, pocketing the coin. Miss Lavender, leading the horse,
disappeared among the trees.

But it was not quite so easy as Jake supposed. He had not been at home ten minutes, before
the precious piece of silver, transferred back and forth between his pocket and his hand in
the restless ecstasy of possession, was perceived by Joe. Then, as Jake stoutly refused to
tell where it came from, Joe rushed into the kitchen, exclaiming,--

"Mammy, Jake's stole a levy!"

This brought out Mother Fairthorn and Sally, and the unfortunate Jake, pressed and threatened
on all sides, began to cry lamentably.

"She'll take it from me ag'in, if I tell," he whimpered.

"She? Who?" cried both at once, their curiosity now fully excited; and the end of it was that
Jake told the whole story, and was made wretched.

"Well!" Sally exclaimed, "this beats all! Gilbert Potter's bay horse, too! Whatever could she
be after? I'll have no peace till I tell Martha, and so I may as well go up at once, for there's
something in the wind, and if she don't know already, she ought to!"

Thereupon Sally put on her bonnet, leaving her pewters half scoured, and ran rather than walked
to the village. Martha Deane could give no explanation of the circumstance, but endeavored,
for Miss Lavender's sake, to conceal her extreme surprise.

"We shall know what it means," she said, "when Betsy comes home, and if it's anything that
concerns me, I promise, Sally, to tell you. It may, however, relate to some business of her
own, and so, I think, we had better quietly wait and say nothing about it."

Nevertheless, after Sally's departure, Martha meditated long and uneasily upon what she had
heard. The fact that Miss Lavender had come back from the Potter farmhouse in so unusual a
frame of mind, borrowed Gilbert's horse, and set forth on some mysterious errand, had already
disquieted her. More than the predicted week of absence had passed, and now Miss Lavender,
instead of returning home, appeared to be hiding in the woods, anxious that her presence in
the neighborhood should not be made known. Moreover she had been seen by the landlord of the
Unicorn, three days before, near Logtown, riding towards Kennett Square.

These mysterious movements filled Martha Deane with a sense of anxious foreboding. She felt
sure that they were connected, in some way, with Gilbert's interests, and Miss Lavender's reticence
now seemed to indicate a coming misfortune which she was endeavoring to avert. If these fears
were correct, Gilbert needed her help also. He could not come to her; was she not called upon
to go to him?

Her resolution was soon taken, and she only waited until her father had left on a visit to
two or three patients along the Street Road. His questions, she knew, would bring on another
painful conflict of will, and she would save her strength for Gilbert's necessities. To avoid
the inferences of the tavern loungers, she chose the longer way, eastward out of the village
to the cross-road running past the Carson place.

All the sweet, faint tokens of Spring cheered her eyes and calmed the unrest of her heart,
as she rode. Among the dead leaves of the woods, the snowy blossoms of the blood-root had already
burst forth in starry clusters; the anemones trembled between the sheltering knees of the old
oaks, and here and there a single buttercup dropped its gold on the meadows. These things were
so many presentiments of brighter days in Nature, and they awoke a corresponding faith in her
own heart.

As she approached the Potter farm she slackened her horse's pace, and deliberated whether she
should ride directly to the house or seek for Gilbert in the fields. She had not seen Mary
Potter since that eventful Sunday, the previous summer, and felt that Gilbert ought to be consulted
before a visit which might possibly give pain. Her doubts were suddenly terminated by his appearance,
with Sam and an ox-cart, in the road before her.

Gilbert could with difficulty wait until the slow oxen had removed Sam out of hearing.

"Martha! were you coming to me?" he asked.

"As I promised, Gilbert," she said. "But do not look so anxious. If there really is any trouble,
I must learn it of you."

She then related to him what she had noticed in Miss Lavender's manner, and learned of her
movements. He stood before her, listening, with his hand on the mane of her horse, and his
eyes intently fixed on her face. She saw the agitation her words produced, and her own vague
fears returned.

"Can you guess her business, Gilbert?" she asked.

"Martha," he answered, "I only know that there is something in her mind, and I believe it concerns
me. I am afraid to guess anything more, because I have only my own wild fancies to go upon,
and it won't do to give 'em play!"

"What are those fancies, Gilbert? May I not know?"

"Can you trust me a little, Martha?" he implored. "Whatever I know, you shall know; but if
I sometimes seek useless trouble for myself, why should I seek it for you? I'll tell you now
one fear I've kept from you, and you'll see what I mean."

He related to her his dread that Sandy Flash might prove to be his father, and the solution
of it in the highwayman's cell. "Have I not done right?" he asked.

"I am not sure, Gilbert," she replied, with a brave smile; "you might have tested my truth,
once more, if you had spoken your fears."

"I need no test, Martha; and you won't press me for another, now. I'll only say, and you'll
be satisfied with it, that Betsy seemed to guess what was in my mind, and promised, or rather
expected, to come back with good news."

"Then," said Martha, "I must wait until she makes her appearance."

She had hardly spoken the words, before a figure became visible between the shock-headed willows,
where the road crosses the stream. A bay horse--and then Betsy Lavender herself!

Martha turned her horse's head, and Gilbert hastened forward with her, both silent and keenly
excited.

"Well!" exclaimed Miss Betsy, "what are you two a-doin' here?"

There was news in her face, both saw; yet they also remarked that the meeting did not seem
to be entirely welcome to her.

"I came," said Martha, "to see whether Gilbert could tell me why you were hiding in the woods,
instead of coming home."

"It's that--that good-for-nothin' serpent, Jake Fairthorn!" cried Miss Lavender. "I see it
all now. Much Gilbert could tell you, howsever, or you him, o' my business, and haven't I a
right to it, as well as other folks; but never mind, fine as it's spun it'll come to the sun,
as they say o' flax and sinful doin's; not that such is mine, but you may think so if you like,
and you'll know in a day or two, anyhow!"

Martha saw that Miss Lavender's lean hands were trembling, and guessed that her news must be
of vital importance. "Betsy," she said, "I see you don't mean to tell us; but one word you
can't refuse--is it good or bad?"

"Good or bad?" Miss Lavender repeated, growing more and more nervous, as she looked at the
two anxious faces. "Well, it isn't bad, so peart yourselves up, and ask me no more questions,
this day, nor yet to-morrow, maybe; because if you do, I'll just screech with all my might;
I'll holler, Gilbert, wuss 'n you heerd, and much good that'll do you, givin' me a crazy name
all over the country. I'm in dead earnest; if you try to worm anything more out o' me, I'll
screech; and so I was goin' to bring your horse home, Gilbert, and have a talk with your mother,
but you've made me mortal weak betwixt and between you; and I'll ride back with Martha, by
your leave, and you may send Sam right away for the horse. No; let Sam come now, and walk alongside,
to save me from Martha's cur'osity."

Miss Lavender would not rest until this arrangement was made. The two ladies then rode away
through the pale, hazy sunset, leaving Gilbert Potter in a fever of impatience, dread, and hope.

CHAPTER XXX.

THE FUNERAL.

The next morning, at daybreak, Dr. Deane was summoned in haste to the Barton farm-house. Miss
Betsy Lavender, whose secrets, whatever they were, had interfered with her sleep, heard Giles's
first knock, and thrust her night-cap out the window before he could repeat it. The old man,
so Giles announced, had a bad spell,--a 'plectic fit, Lawyer Stacy called it, and they didn't
know as he'd live from one hour to another.

Miss Lavender aroused the Doctor, then dressed herself in haste, and prepared to accompany
him. Martha, awakened by the noise, came into the spinster's room in her night-dress.

"Must you go, Betsy?" she asked.

"Child, it's a matter o' life and death, more likely death; and Ann's a dooless critter at
best, hardly ever off the place, and need o' Chris'en help, if there ever was such; so don't
ask me to stay, for I won't, and all the better for me, for I daresn't open my lips to livin'
soul till I've spoke with Mary Potter!"

Miss Lavender took the foot-path across the fields, accompanied by Giles, who gave up his saddled
horse to Dr. Deane. The dawn was brightening in the sky as they reached the farm-house, where
they found Alfred Barton restlessly walking backwards and forwards in the kitchen, while Ann
and Mr. Stacy were endeavoring to apply such scanty restoratives--consisting principally of
lavender and hot bricks--as the place afforded.

An examination of the eyes and the pulse, and a last abortive attempt at phlebotomy, convinced
Dr. Deane that his services were no longer needed. Death, which so many years before had lamed
half the body, now asserted his claim to the whole. A wonderfully persistent principle of vitality
struggled against the clogged functions, for two or three hours, then yielded, and the small
fragment of soul in the old man was cast adrift, with little chance of finding a comfortable
lodging in any other world.

Ann wandered about the kitchen in a dazed state, dropping tears everywhere, and now and then
moaning,--"O Betsy, how'll I ever get up the funeral dinner?" while Alfred, after emptying
the square bottle of brandy, threw himself upon the settle and went to sleep. Mr. Stacy and
Miss Lavender, who seemed to know each other thoroughly at the first sight, took charge of
all the necessary arrangements; and as Alfred had said,--"I can't look after anything; do as
you two like, and don't spare expense!" they ordered the coffin, dispatched messengers to the
relatives and neighbors, and soothed Ann's unquiet soul by selecting the material for the dinner,
and engaging the Unicorn's cook.

When all was done, late in the day, Miss Lavender called Giles and said,--"Saddle me a horse,
and if no side-saddle, a man's'll do, for go I must; it's business o' my own, Mr. Stacy, and
won't wait for me; not that I want to do more this day than what I've done. Goodness knows;
but I'll have a fit, myself, if I don't!"

She reached the Potter farm-house at dark, and both mother and son were struck with her flushed,
excited, and yet weary air. Their supper was over, but she refused to take anything more than
a cup of tea; her speech was forced, and more rambling and disconnected than ever. When Mary
Potter left the kitchen to bring some fresh cream from the spring-house, Miss Lavender hastily
approached Gilbert, laid her hand on his shoulder, and said,--

"Lad, be good this once't, and do what I tell you. Make a reason for goin' to bed as soon as
you can; for I've been workin' in your interest all this while, only I've got that to tell
your mother, first of all, which you mustn't hear; and you may hope as much as you please,
for the news isn't bad, as'll soon be made manifest!"

Gilbert was strangely impressed by her solemn, earnest manner, and promised to obey. He guessed,
and yet feared to believe, that the long release of which his mother had spoken bad come at
last; how else, he asked himself, should Miss Lavender become possessed of knowledge which
seemed so important? As early as possible he went up to his bedroom, leaving the two women
alone. The sound of voices, now high and hurried, now, apparently, low and broken, came to
his ears. He resisted the temptation to listen, smothered his head in the pillow to further
muffle the sounds, and after a long, restless struggle with his own mind, fell asleep. Deep
in the night he was awakened by the noise of a shutting door, and then all was still.

It was very evident, in the morning, that he had not miscalculated the importance of Miss Lavender's
communication. Was this woman, whose face shone with such a mingled light of awe and triumph,
his mother? Were these features, where the deep lines of patience were softened into curves
of rejoicing, the dark, smouldering gleam of sorrow kindled into a flashing light of pride,
those he had known from childhood? As he looked at her, in wonder renewed with every one of
her movements and glances, she took him by the hand and said,--

"Gilbert, wait a little!"

Miss Lavender insisted on having breakfast by sunrise, and as soon as the meal was over demanded
her horse. Then first she announced the fact of Old-man Barton's death, and that the funeral
was to be on the following day.

"Mary, you must be sure and come," she said, as she took leave; "I know Ann expects it of you.
Ten o'clock, remember!"

Gilbert noticed that his mother laid aside her sewing, and when the ordinary household labor
had been performed, seated herself near the window with a small old Bible, which he had never
before seen in her hands. There was a strange fixedness in her gaze, as if only her eyes, not
her thoughts, were directed upon its pages. The new expression of her face remained; it seemed
already to have acquired as permanent a stamp as the old. Against his will he was infected
by its power, and moved about in barn and field all day with a sense of the unreality of things,
which was very painful to his strong, practical nature.

The day of the old man's funeral came. Sam led up the horses, and waited at the gate with them
to receive his master's parting instructions. Gilbert remarked with surprise that his mother
placed a folded paper between the leaves of the Bible, tied the book carefully in a linen handkerchief,
and carried it with her. She was ready, but still hesitated, looking around the kitchen with
the manner of one who had forgotten something. Then she returned to her own room, and after
some minutes, came forth, paler than before, but proud, composed, and firm.

"Gilbert," she said, almost in a whisper, "I have tried you sorely, and you have been wonderfully
kind and patient. I have no right to ask anything more; I could tell you everything now, but
this is not the place nor the time I had thought of, for so many years past. Will you let me
finish the work in the way pointed out to me?"

"Mother," he answered, "I cannot judge in this matter, knowing nothing. I must be led by you;
but, pray, do not let it be long?" 

Fifteen days had gone-fifteen days of killing lumpenproletariat-and there was anticipation before them.
She fell herself to it, cheered up the chalk withdrawing of activity done and time agitated
which Mr. Wardrop wrote by on a generator-room bulkhead.

"I will, mother," he said, "because you make me feel that I must."

They mounted, and side by side rode up the glen. Mary Potter was silent; now and then her lips
moved, not, as once, in some desperate appeal of the heart for pity and help, but as with a
thanksgiving so profound that it must needs be constantly renewed, to be credited.

After passing Carson's, they took the shorter way across the fields, and approached the Barton
farm-house from below. A large concourse of people was already assembled; and the rude black
hearse, awaiting its burden in the lane, spread the awe and the gloom of death over the scene.
The visitors were grouped around the doors, silent or speaking cautiously in subdued tones;
and all new-comers passed into the house to take their last look at the face, of the dead.

The best room, in which the corpse lay, was scarcely used once in a year, and many of the neighbors
had never before had occasion to enter it. The shabby, antiquated furniture looked cold and
dreary from disuse, and the smell of camphor in the air hardly kept down the musty, mouldy
odors which exhaled from the walls. The head and foot of the coffin rested on two chairs placed
in the centre of the room; and several women, one of whom was Miss Betsy Lavender, conducted
the visitors back and forth, as they came. The members of the bereaved family were stiffly
ranged around the walls, the chief mourners consisting of the old man's eldest son, Elisha,
with his wife and three married sons, Alfred, and Ann.

Mary Potter took her son's arm, and they passed through the throng at the door, and entered
the house. Gilbert silently returned the nods of greeting; his mother neither met nor avoided
the eyes of others. Her step was firm, her head erect, her bearing full of pride and decision.
Miss Lavender, who met her with a questioning glance at the door, walked beside her to the
room of death, and then--what was remarkable in her--became very pale.

They stood by the coffin. It was not a peaceful, solemn sight, that yellow face, with its wrinkles
and creases and dark blotches of congealed blood, made more pronounced and ugly by the white
shroud and cravat, yet a tear rolled down Mary Potter's cheek as she gazed upon it. Other visitors
came, and Gilbert gently drew her away, to leave the room; but with a quick pressure upon his
arm, as if to remind him of his promise, she quietly took her seat near the mourners, and by
a slight motion indicated that he should seat himself at her side.

It was an unexpected and painful position; but her face, firm and calm, shamed his own embarrassment.
He saw, nevertheless, that the grief of the mourners was not so profound as to suppress the
surprise, if not indignation, which the act called forth. The women had their handkerchiefs
to their eyes, and were weeping in a slow, silent, mechanical way; the men had handkerchiefs
in their hands, but their faces were hard, apathetic, and constrained.

By-and-by the visitors ceased; the attending women exchanged glances with each other and with
the mourners, and one of the former stepped up to Mary Potter and said gently,--

"It is only the family, now."

This was according to custom, which required that just before the coffin was closed, the members
of the family of the deceased should be left alone with him for a few minutes, and take their
farewell of his face, undisturbed by other eyes. Gilbert would have risen, but his mother,
with her hand on his arm, quietly replied,--

"We belong to the family."

The woman withdrew, though with apparent doubt and hesitation, and they were left alone with
the mourners.

Gilbert could scarcely trust his senses. A swift suspicion of his mother's insanity crossed
his mind; but when he looked around the room and beheld Alfred Barton gazing upon her with
a face more livid than that of the dead man, this suspicion was followed by another, no less
overwhelming. For a few minutes everything seemed to whirl and spin before his eyes; a light
broke upon him, but so unexpected, so incredible, that it came with the force of a blow.

The undertaker entered the room and screwed down the lid of the coffin; the pall-bearers followed
and carried it to the hearse. Then the mourners rose and prepared to set forth, in the order
of their relation to the deceased. Elisha Barton led the way, with his wife; then Ann, clad
in her Sunday black, stepped forward to take Alfred's arm.

"Ann," said Mary Potter, in a low voice, which yet was heard by every person in the room, "that
is my place."

She left Gilbert and moved to Alfred Barton's side. Then, slightly turning, she said,--"Gilbert,
give your arm to your aunt."

For a full minute no other word was said. Alfred Barton stood motionless, with Mary Potter's
hand on his arm. A fiery flush succeeded to his pallor; his jaw fell, and his eyes were fixed
upon the floor. Ann took Gilbert's arm in a helpless, bewildered way.

"Alfred, what does all this mean?" Elisha finally asked.

He said nothing; Mary Potter answered for him,--"It is right that he should walk with his wife
rather than his sister."

The horses and chairs were waiting in the lane, and helping neighbors were at the door; but
the solemn occasion was forgotten, in the shock produced by this announcement. Gilbert started
and almost reeled; Ann clung to him with helpless terror; and only Elisha, whose face grew
dark and threatening, answered.

"Woman," he said, "you are out of your senses! Leave us; you have no business here!"

She met him with a proud, a serene and steady countenance. "Elisha," she answered, "we are
here to bury your father and my father-in-law. Let be until the grave has closed over him;
then ask Alfred whether I could dare to take my rightful place before to-day."

The solemn decision of her face and voice struck him dumb. His wife whispered a few words in
his ear, and he turned away with her, to take his place in the funeral procession.

It was Alfred Barton's duty to follow, and if it was not grief which impelled him to bury his
face in his handkerchief as they issued from the door, it was a torture keener than was ever
mingled with grief,--the torture of a mean nature, pilloried in its meanest aspect for the
public gaze. Mary, (we must not call her Potter, and cannot yet call her Barton,) rather led
him than was led by him, and lifted her face to the eyes of men. The shame which she might
have felt, as his wife, was lost in the one overpowering sense of the justification for which
she had so long waited and suffered.

When the pair appeared in the yard, and Gilbert followed with Miss Ann Barton on his arm, most
of the funeral guests looked on in stupid wonder, unable to conceive the reason of the two
thus appearing among the mourners. But when they had mounted and were moving off, a rumor of
the startling truth ran from lip to lip. The proper order of the procession was forgotten;
some untied their horses in haste and pushed forward to convince themselves of the astonishing
fact; others gathered into groups and discussed it earnestly. Some had suspected a relation
of the kind, all along, so they said; others scouted at the story, and were ready with explanations
of their own. But not a soul had another thought to spare for Old-man Barton that day.

Dr. Deane and Martha heard what had happened as they were mounting their horses. When they
took their places in the line, the singular companionship, behind the hearse, was plainly visible.
Neither spoke a word, but Martha felt that her heart was beating fast, and that her thoughts
were unsteady.

Presently Miss Lavender rode up and took her place at her side. Tears were streaming from her
eyes, and she was using her handkerchief freely. It was sometime before she could command her
feelings enough to say, in a husky whisper,--

"I never thought to ha' had a hand in such wonderful doin's, and how I held up through it,
I can't tell. Glory to the Lord, the end has come; but, no--not yet--not quite; only enough
for one day, Martha; isn't it?"

"Betsy," said Martha, "please ride a little closer, and explain to me how it came about. Give
me one or two points for my mind to rest on, for I don't seem to believe even what I see."

"What I see. No wonder, who could? Well, it's enough that Mary was married to Alf. Barton a
matter o' twenty-six year ago, and that he swore her to keep it secret till th' old man died,
and he's been her husband all this while, and knowed it!"

"Father!" Martha exclaimed in a low, solemn voice, turning to Dr. Deane, "think, now, what
it was thee would have had me do!"

The Doctor was already aware of his terrible mistake. "Thee was led, child," he answered, "thee
was led! It was a merciful Providence."

"Then might thee not also admit that I have been led in that other respect, which has been
so great a trial to thee?"

He made no reply.

The road to Old Kennett never seemed so long; never was a corpse so impatiently followed. A
sense of decency restrained those who were not relatives from pushing in advance of those who
were; yet it was, very tantalizing to look upon the backs of Alfred Barton and Mary, Gilbert
and Ann, when their faces must be such a sight to see!

These four, however, rode in silence. Each, it may be guessed, was sufficiently occupied with
his or her own sensations,--except, perhaps, Ann Barton, who had been thrown so violently out
of her quiet, passive round of life by her father's death, that she was incapable of any great
surprise. Her thoughts were more occupied with the funeral-dinner, yet to come, than with the
relationship of the young man at her side.

Gilbert slowly admitted the fact into his mind, but he was so unprepared for it by anything
in his mother's life or his own intercourse with Alfred Barton, that he was lost in a maze
of baffled conjectures. While this confusion lasted, he scarcely thought of his restoration
to honor, or the breaking down of that fatal barrier between him and Martha Deane. His first
sensation was one of humiliation and disappointment. How often had he been disgusted with Alfred
Barton's meanness and swagger! How much superior, in many of the qualities of manhood, was
even the highwayman, whose paternity he had so feared! As he looked at the broad, heavy form
before him, in which even the lines of the back expressed cowardice and abject shame, he almost
doubted whether his former disgrace was not preferable to his present claim to respect.

Then his eyes turned to his mother's figure, and a sweet, proud joy swept away the previous
emotion. Whatever the acknowledged relationship might be to him, to her it was honor--yea,
more than honor; for by so much and so cruelly as she had fallen below the rights of her pure
name as a woman, the higher would she now be set, not only in respect, but in the reverence
earned by her saintly patience and self-denial. The wonderful transformation of her face showed
him what this day was to her life, and he resolved that no disappointment of his own should
come between her and her triumph.

To Gilbert the way was not too long, nor the progress too slow. It gave him time to grow familiar,
not only with the fact, but with his duty. He forcibly postponed his wandering conjectures,
and compelled his mind to dwell upon that which lay immediately before him.

It was nearly noon before the hearse reached Old Kennett meeting-house. The people of the neighborhood,
who had collected to await its arrival, came forward and assisted the mourners to alight. Alfred
Barton mechanically took his place beside his wife, but again buried his face in his handkerchief.
As the wondering, impatient crowd gathered around, Gilbert felt that all was known, and that
all eyes were fixed upon himself and his mother, and his face reflected her own firmness and
strength. From neither could the spectators guess what might be passing in their hearts. They
were both paler than usual, and their resemblance to each other became very striking. Gilbert,
in fact, seemed to have nothing of his father except the peculiar turn of his shoulders and
the strong build of his chest.

They walked over the grassy, briery, unmarked mounds of old graves to the spot where a pile
of yellow earth denoted Old Barton's resting-place. When the coffin had been lowered, his children,
in accordance with custom, drew near, one after the other, to bend over and look into the narrow
pit. Gilbert led up his trembling aunt, who might have fallen in, had he not carefully supported
her. As he was withdrawing, his eyes suddenly encountered those of Martha Deane, who was standing
opposite, in the circle of hushed spectators. In spite of himself a light color shot into his
face, and his lips trembled. The eager gossips, who had not missed even the wink of an eyelid,
saw this fleeting touch of emotion, and whence it came. Thenceforth Martha shared their inspection;
but from the sweet gravity of her face, the untroubled calm of her eyes, they learned nothing more.

When the grave had been filled, and the yellow mound ridged and patted with the spade, the
family returned to the grassy space in front of the meeting-house, and now their more familiar
acquaintances, and many who were not, gathered around to greet them and offer words of condolence.
An overpowering feeling of curiosity was visible upon every face; those who did not venture
to use their tongues, used their eyes the more.

Alfred Barton was forced to remove the handkerchief from his face, and its haggard wretchedness
(which no one attributed to grief for his father's death), could no longer be hidden. He appeared
to have suddenly become an old man, with deeper wrinkles, slacker muscles, and a helpless,
tottering air of weakness. The corners of his mouth drooped, hollowing his cheeks, and his
eyes seemed unable to bear up the weight of the lids; they darted rapidly from side to side,
or sought the ground, not daring to encounter, for more than an instant, those of others.

There was no very delicate sense of propriety among the people, and very soon an inquisitive
old Quaker remarked,--

"Why, Mary, is this true that I hear? Are you two man and wife?"

"We are," she said.

"Bless us! how did it happen?"

The bystanders became still as death, and all ears were stretched to catch the answer. But
she, with proud, impenetrable calmness, replied,--

"It will be made known."

And with these words the people were forced, that day to be satisfied.

CHAPTER XXXI.

THE WILL.

During the homeward journey from the grave, Gilbert and his mother were still the central figures
of interest. That the members of the Barton family were annoyed and humiliated, was evident
to all eyes; but it was a pitiful, undignified position, which drew no sympathy towards them,
while the proud, composed gravity of the former commanded respect. The young men and women,
especially, were unanimously of the opinion that Gilbert had conducted himself like a man.
They were disappointed, it was true, that he and Martha Deane had not met, in the sight of
all. It was impossible to guess whether she had been already aware of the secret, or how the
knowledge of it would affect their romantic relation to each other.

Could the hearts of the lovers have been laid bare, the people would have seen that never had
each felt such need of the other,--never had they been possessed with such restless yearning.
To the very last, Gilbert's eyes wandered from time to time towards the slender figure in the
cavalcade before him, hoping for the chance of a word or look; but Martha's finer instinct
told her that she must yet hold herself aloof. She appreciated the solemnity of the revelation,
saw that much was yet unexplained, and could have guessed, even without Miss Lavender's mysterious
hints, that the day would bring forth other and more important disclosures.

As the procession drew nearer Kennett Square, the curiosity of the funeral guests, baulked
and yet constantly stimulated, began to grow disorderly. Sally Fairthorn was in such a flutter
that she scarcely knew what she said or did; Mark's authority alone prevented her from dashing
up to Gilbert, regardless of appearances. The old men, especially those in plain coats and
broad-brimmed hats, took every opportunity to press near the mourners; and but for Miss Betsy
Lavender, who hovered around the latter like a watchful dragon, both Gilbert and his mother
would have been seriously annoyed. Finally the gate at the lane-end closed upon them, and the
discomfited public rode on to the village, tormented by keen envy of the few who had been bidden
to the funeral-dinner.

When Mary alighted from her horse, the old lawyer approached her.

"My name is Stacy, Mrs. Barton," he said, "and Miss Lavender will have told you who I am. Will
you let me have a word with you in private?"

She slightly started at the name he had given her; it was the first symptom of agitation she
had exhibited. He took her aside, and began talking earnestly in a low tone. Elisha Barton
looked on with an amazed, troubled air, and presently turned to his brother.

"Alfred," he said, "it is quite time all this was explained."

But Miss Lavender interfered.

"It's your right, Mr. Elisha, no denyin' that, and the right of all the fam'ly; so we've agreed
to have it done afore all together, in the lawful way, Mr. Stacy bein' a lawyer; but dinner
first, if you please, for eatin' 's good both for grief and cur'osity, and it's hard tellin'
which is uppermost in this case. Gilbert, come here!"

He was standing alone, beside the paling. He obeyed her call.

"Gilbert, shake hands with your uncle and aunt Mr. Elisha, this is your nephew, Gilbert Barton,
Mr. Alfred's son."

They looked at each other for a moment. There was that in Gilbert's face which enforced respect.
Contrasted with his father, who stood on one side, darting stealthy glances at the group from
the corners of his eyes, his bearing was doubly brave and noble. He offered his hand in silence,
and both Elisha Barton and his wife felt themselves compelled to take it. Then the three sons,
who knew the name of Gilbert Potter, and were more astonished than shocked at the new relationship,
came up and greeted their cousin in a grave but not unfriendly way.

"That's right!" exclaimed Miss Lavender. "And now come in to dinner, all o' ye! I gev orders
to have the meats dished as soon as the first horse was seen over the rise o' the hill, and
it'll all be smokin' on the table."

Though the meal was such as no one had ever before seen in the Barton farm-house, it was enjoyed
by very few of the company. The sense of something to come after it made them silent and uncomfortable.
Mr. Stacy, Miss Lavender, and the sons of Elisha Barton, with their wives, carried on a scattering,
forced conversation, and there was a general feeling of relief when the pies, marmalade, and
cheese had been consumed, and the knives and forks laid crosswise over the plates.

When they arose from the table, Mr. Stacy led the way into the parlor. A fire, in the mean
time, had been made in the chill, open fireplace, but it scarcely relieved the dreary, frosty
aspect of the apartment. The presence of the corpse seemed to linger there, attaching itself
with ghastly distinctness to the chair and hickory staff in a corner.

The few dinner-guests who were not relatives understood that this meeting excluded them, and
Elisha Barton was therefore surprised to notice, after they had taken their seats, that Miss
Lavender was one of the company.

"I thought," he said, with a significant look, "that it was to be the family only."

"Miss Lavender is one of the witnesses to the will," Mr. Stacy answered, "and her presence
is necessary, moreover, as an important testimony in regard to some of its provisions."

Alfred Barton and Gilbert both started at these words, but from very different feelings. The
former, released from public scrutiny, already experienced a comparative degree of comfort,
and held up his head with an air of courage; yet now the lawyer's announcement threw him into
an agitation which it was not possible to conceal. Miss Lavender looked around the circle,
coolly nodded her head to Elisha Barton, and said nothing.

Mr. Stacy arose, unlocked a small niche let into the wall of the house, and produced the heavy
oaken casket in which the old man kept the documents relating to his property. This he placed
upon a small table beside his chair, opened it, and took out the topmost paper. He was completely
master of the situation, and the deliberation with which he surveyed the circle of excited
faces around him seemed to indicate that he enjoyed the fact.

"The last will and testament of Abiah Barton, made the day before his death," he said, "revokes
all former wills, which were destroyed by his order, in the presence of myself and Miss Elizabeth
Lavender."

All eyes were turned upon the spinster, who again nodded, with a face of preternatural solemnity.

"In order that you, his children and grandchildren," Mr. Stacy continued, "may rightly understand
the deceased's intention in making this last will, when the time comes for me to read it, I
must first inform you that he was acquainted with the fact of his son Alfred's marriage with
Mary Potter."

Alfred Barton half sprang from his seat, and then fell back with the same startled, livid face,
which Gilbert already knew. The others held their breath in suspense,--except Mary, who sat
near the lawyer, firm, cold, and unmoved.

"The marriage of Alfred Barton and Mary Potter must therefore be established, to your satisfaction,"
Mr. Stacy resumed, turning towards Elisha. "Alfred Barton, I ask you to declare whether this
woman is your lawfully wedded wife?"

A sound almost like a groan came from his throat, but it formed the syllable,--"Yes."

"Further, I ask you to declare whether Gilbert Barton, who has until this day borne his mother's
name of Potter, is your lawfully begotten son?"

"Yes."

"To complete the evidence," said the lawyer, "Mary Barton, give me the paper in your hands."

She untied the handkerchief, opened the Bible, and handed Mr. Stacy the slip of paper which
Gilbert had seen her place between the leaves that morning. The lawyer gave it to Elisha Barton,
with the request that he would read it aloud.

It was the certificate of a magistrate at Burlington, in the Colony of New Jersey, setting
forth that he had united in wedlock Alfred Barton and Mary Potter. The date was in the month
of June, 1771.

"This paper," said Elisha, when he had finished reading, "appears to be genuine. The evidence
must have been satisfactory to you, Mr. Stacy, and to my father, since it appears to have been
the cause of his making a new will; but as this new will probably concerns me and my children,
I demand to know why; if the marriage was legal, it has been kept secret so long? The fact
of the marriage does not explain what has happened to-day."

Mr. Stacy turned towards Gilbert's mother, and made a sign.

"Shall I explain it in my way, Alfred?" she asked, "or will you, in yours?"

"There's but one story," he answered, "and I guess it falls to your place to tell it." "It
does!" she exclaimed. "You, Elisha and Ann, and you, Gilbert, my child, take notice that every
word of what I shall say is the plain God's truth. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was a young
woman of twenty, I came to this farm to help Ann with the house-work. You remember it, Ann;
it was just after your mother's death. I was poor; I had neither father nor mother, but I was
as proud as the proudest, and the people called me good-looking. You were vexed with me, Ann,
because the young men came now and then, of a Sunday afternoon; but I put up with your hard
words. You did not know that I understood what Alfred's eyes meant when he looked at me; I
put up with you because I believed I could be mistress of the house, in your place. You have
had your revenge of me since, if you felt the want of it--so let that rest!"

She paused. Ann, with her handkerchief to her eyes, sobbed out,--"Mary, I always liked you
better 'n you thought."

"I can believe it," she continued, "for I have been forced to look into my heart and learn
how vain and mistaken I then was. But I liked Alfred, in those days; he was a gay young man,
and accounted good-looking, and there were merry times just before the war, and he used to

Alfred Barton walked to the garden-fence, leaned his arms upon it, and his head upon them.
He was still leaning there, when mother and son rode by in the twilight, on their way home.

CHAPTER XXXII.

THE LOVERS.

Both mother and son made the homeward ride in silence. A wide space, a deep gulf of time, separated
them from the morning. The events of the day had been so startling, so pregnant with compressed
fate, the emotions they had undergone had been so profound, so mixed of the keenest elements
of wonder, pain, and pride, that a feeling of exhaustion succeeded. The old basis of their
lives seemed to have shifted, and the new foundations were not yet firm under their feet.

Yet, as they sat together before the hearth-fire that evening, and the stern, proud calm of
Gilbert's face slowly melted into a gentler and tenderer expression, his mother was moved to speak.

"This has been my day," she said; "it was appointed and set apart for me from the first; it
belonged to me, and I have used it, in my right, from sun to sun. But I feel now, that it was
not my own strength alone that held me up. I am weak and weary, and it almost seems that I
fail in thanksgiving. Is it, Gilbert, because you do not rejoice as I had hoped you would?"

"Mother," he answered, "whatever may happen in my life, I can never feel so proud of myself,
as I felt to-day, to be your son. I do rejoice for your sake, as I shall for my own, no doubt,
when I get better used to the truth. You could not expect me, at once, to be satisfied with
a father who has not only acted so cruelly towards you, but whom I have suspected of being
my own rival and enemy. I don't think I shall ever like the new name as well as the old, but
it is enough for me that the name brings honor and independence to you!"

"Perhaps I ought to ha' told you this morning, Gilbert I thought only of the justification,
not of the trial; and it seemed easier to speak in actions, to you and to all men at once,
as I did, than to tell the story quietly to you alone. I feared it might take away my strength,
if I didn't follow, step by step, the course marked out for me."

"You were right, mother!" he exclaimed. "What trial had I, compared with yours? What tale had
I to tell--what pain to feel, except that if I had not been born, you would have been saved
twenty-five years of suffering!"

"No, Gilbert!--never say, never think that! I see already the suffering and the sorrow dying
away as if they'd never been, and you left to me for the rest of life the Lord grants; to me
a son has been more than a husband!"

"Then," he asked in an anxious, hesitating tone, "would you consider that I was not quite so
much a son--that any part of my duty to you was lost--if I wished to bring you a daughter, also?".

"I know what you mean, Gilbert Betsy Lavender has told me all. I am glad you spoke of it, this
day; it will put the right feeling of thanksgiving into my heart and yours. Martha Deane never
stood between us, my boy; it was I that stood between you and her!"

"Mother!" he cried, a joyous light shining from his face, "you love her? You are willing that
she should be my wife?"

"Ay, Gilbert; willing, and thankful, and proud."

"But the very name of her struck you down! You fell into a deadly faint when I told you I had
spoken my mind to her!"

"I see, my boy," she said; "I see now why you never mentioned her name, from that time. It
was not Martha Deane, but the name of the one you thought wanted to win her away from you,--your
father's name, Gilbert,--that seemed to put a stop to my life. Her stood through s, do not all done by sandy as many, he served all

The did not find few place, but
her built the part took the deal.
 It was not danger, this time, beyond the brink of which they met, but rather
a sudden visitation of security; yet both were deeply and powerfully agitated. Martha was the
first to recover her composure. Withdrawing herself from Gilbert's arms, she said,--

"It was not right that the tests should be all on my side. Now it is my turn to try you, Gilbert!"

Even her arch, happy smile did not enlighten him. "How, Martha?" he asked.

"Since you don't know, you are already tested. But how grave you look! Have I not yet learned
all of this wonderful, wonderful history? Did Betsy Lavender keep something back?"

"Martha!" he cried, "you shame me out of the words I had meant to say. But they were doubts
of my own position, not of you. Is my new name better or worse in your ears, than my old one?"

"To me you are only Gilbert," she answered, "as I am Martha to you. What does it matter whether
we write Potter or Barton? Either is good in itself, and so would any other name be; but Barton
means something, as the world goes, and therefore we will take it. Gilbert, I have put myself
in your place, since I learned the whole truth. I guessed you would come to me with a strange,
uncertain feeling,--not a doubt, but rather a wonder; and I endeavored to make your new circumstances
clear to my mind. The Politico was about his Example, shining another doubt, happen why the People

"Martha," he said, "that is my trouble,--or, rather, my disappointment,--that with my true
name I must bring to you and fasten upon you the whole mean and shameful story! One parent
must always be honored at the expense of the other, and my name still belongs to the one that
is disgraced."
