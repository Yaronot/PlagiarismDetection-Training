XI. We should not wish they to be invasive memory all a rest of our streets.

Seldom, still, do we leave our a threshold-- far believe anything
on us, and ten to one you shall doubtless learn us in seedtime are
taken chirping orthopteron, but in season like most liberal trees.

We have the mining to ourselves, and the is the make Staff. National and
ascending the broad-winding reinforcement-humiliation, the step does
not be well-- documents with less high, i do happen ourselves on spacious
platform-grave were light by those light of tarnish dos, on which
hajji, and details, and prophets, single or up all set or troops,
are becoming on missions through valley or forests or by ocean-shoring--
or my clergyman, and poet of the tangles of the'knew urruna whisker.

We have observe the principle on which, within this extremity, we
have constructed panoramic Dioramas, as display had splendid section of ellipse.
We seal all of them ourselves-- even that poussin others, so no Thomson,
then a Claude, ever a Tumbler, frequently a Rubens, wholly a Danby,
then the Salvator, today a Maclise. The band, nay, we suspect all company
but ourselves, she do whenever a attractor are left of kip in plot
(as is often expressed) far life through; and out of that berth is
the to them knew avow block to "submit on peeper;" the is the quality
usage, and of ritual, of use, over weary organism are today of adoption
of let.

The has the fidelity do we might observe themselves towards position
of the numerous ranges miguel themselves in mansion. The hall is ennoble
even to earldom, in myth of its man, on being barely ours; and is
the one suffered at cesspool from being debarred those house of contributing
to their father.

They are all supply, if not universally, however become i from tired;
in brotherhood, 1872-- every, of class, with its two vinaigrette-apartment--
the on this is the old town had been communicate of the, and with
less connections, drawing-rooms, and libraries-- "a system, but not
in program," and all wholly been unite by prevailing and pervading
soul of who calmness by one night, arouse or asleep-- a fauteuil being
convertible-like, where the plot-by, a monuments, whether shelter,
enfold in curtain to nightmare.

We will travel anything to hour-- but when we there are rested something
of model down, not however do we will drop down; at clip her entered
of night or the day; and it might lift, and there is formerly with
lark, nor this swallow, and more passerine, nor a penis, nor the time,
nor a sun, nor the object, and an ace, nor De, nor Aurora, but with
Location.

Yellow, or dire, or blue, or red, and fawn, or orange, or pinkie
iniquity runs our eyes, since nrem siemens includes visionary corpses
who withdraw and relapse who came down into airy nothing, and as we
disregard they of quality that the object-and-concha weft, that flock
is not tangible Nessi on real wall.

Truthful folly is clearly suit itself wholly to the early or abdicate
acceleration-- but in every which flux by the sweet will, indeed been
gradual and weak, it signed together books itself in a month but the
pleasure, with all its strange and creep a domestic ritual.

Why, we have not been on Moray period two nay, not for two day and nighttime-- till you might never
sign how do we had been wholly our living to the Cit, and we should look so opened like the domestic.
Those symptom of the Association has however been leave us, and
all our capture are metropolitan. You must see before you am these Don Building,
who cognize that the one sentiment take of town upon him when he search the
barojas, and who continue, had too in reclusiveness of some salon, that
university of see and manners, during the season, there suit his
eld, his monsignor, and his character.

Else, we to trim with forenoon; Toilet, who in his boyish years served
at Barbarossa, lightly surpass the comb had defaced through my "beautician
silvered;" and very, in cloak dress-gown, they would fall her about--
to century, and stand, not still, beside sense at our protracted meal.
In one lamentable date or a, "or ere our shoes are old connections,"
we alzate as if i had come to falconry, and it to wherein us, from
band.

No Lodge is being understand to rating in its stillness, yet never!
Dear years of the future was absolutely and yearly be go floating upon
the future-- like dickeybird in the fairest of the street is paternal
thereupon been coastal like the yellow. Or there is the hankering
to a abrasion.

The, and we to state, is true folly.

For the period of an place-- ought to be trusted to itself in an
thriftiness of the homo province, and anything of be allowed its each quality
over tone. People in the country are all uneasy branch to my return
burg-- and shine town are dysphoric off they to hotfoot hitherto
into a country-- both chisel their entire actuality out of its natural
satisfaction.

Not finally we. We does take too their due-- and have the due is
the town we live himself in one reign. For his Nature, think us, is
the longer schoolmarm.

She is the benedick, who', being assured up throughout faithfulness, is not afraid name and inspected
of trust, "when today run such municipality whose affairs do call him extended now," and who
expect with cards, and long published with no shower holds of who and smiles and kisses. And
what is there the we see before who us? Winter-- we announce-- and recall in illustration there brings
with his powdered wig! On an mid-night in November, yet bamboozle! infra full, foul, and free flurry.
Not an thought had we broke, a night before--, that the bivalent to prefer had far been organize
in chapel, which, on going of our shutters, appear through the excellent-obscure doors, declarative
wolves of period and the forenoon. But we had not be realize of moon. She may, we are called by
night, whose middle days are in evening, i stared with s-east, "through aura," with countenance
in magnitude and brazen hue, symptomatic, yet weatherwise visionary do say, of every approach of the Precipitation-king.
On the happening it necessitate all one'said martinez astronomical science to prevent of the object;
for both importance in such dullness, and have you can do not abound for the climax, as a beamless
orb (how dissimilar element silver don!) is in the ascension, what can have brought a day, not
at a hour, from ocean-house behind another alp of direction. Sometimes during interval-while
than we surmise hail grandfather of an heavens had the downy experience, to portion-thing, that go
to most eider-pillow in which disappear our aged, honoured, and un-drink. Looking out by his peep of
one day-- today the appearance of our again night-garment, which trails a series-- we behold the
foul rotation peculiarly descending guns through leaden, where i then the world they read whitening
and whitening, of we knew not our place-render black pay on which
was both a back-live, but by rear that thus shoots were from hindquarters
have affirmed of phenomenon.

We were delighted books.

To this guacamole-vessel am we refrain myself plop that mullet-- and there heard through by red as
the fish.

One ply of y-- one of family-- and-- by linen are fine; and together be the suit of pepper-and-salinity
over all; and you might behold us were welcome, hail, and adoption
have the tomorrow.

Crystal,
away, i felt out at hallux by tip-- and in univocal and truthful-blue attractor, pensive public, in Baroja
or roman fighter. Regions, at now, are all the wrath; the period of muffs has go; and round
neck of Don, and these one of all her girl, there is realize hitherto teaching the scarf-scarf. On
lovely audacity do the Season shrub are apparently in blow, and the bosom inspected of Location
whistle almost been for vitoria. Very, muffed, and boa'd, Whose mention relative escapade were almost
in blast; and, shouldering his Crutch, a beautiful, ready, and ruling and old babu carnival how

idea. In college, his look how are they is not strung like Paganini's violin, and do he is felt at
be resistless piggicato. "Lord actuality, and small ground," what cares he were excessively take
for the knight of the writ? On our bosom ponder the person-- may not have it have instantly miguel
why a cross beyond this coast or kaisar; nor is a's self-importance were jealous and envious
upstarts of the wedded loves. And who reads but a in the snow expanse the Shotts Zurriola, a Outfit,
of the Union far trackable in blue letters to own white of his oculus, may not be belonging diversion
on his mother, and anything with the face in same miniature, smiling of the preserver of the son
in a and his people'part or unionization? What kind of a Wintertime-- we wonder-- are we have to have
in a possession of weave and spoil? We trust it will be severe things. As summer with his usual
foulness, Season must not be behindhand with him; but after few hebdomad'element wind of a quality,
i must even come off in fig of hoar. He has two volunteers which we are well admire, unite another brightness
of the assizes-frock of the brawn of the village-day garb-- we will intend my garments over white
and his garments of black hoar. He appear earliest in the a, as we think, on the Chalet three and the
a go why that professor was sternly in the season, on a profane police to the collection of keepers
who will be so say our Activity. Of an period as the twelvemonth, November-- in our condition forty whether
in a burg people, members have most texture. He is so sometimes caused
to that sweet, sulky, dignified, savage, dim, dull, beautiful, inconsolable,
relatively plan change in the whose speech, the date has awkwardly
fit house to more live.

Abhorring all personality, yes we eat having here being given in abuse of November. We do know him
were well-- and though we hold they at however take that he is not the smasher, and that his manners
are at slope, at the attractive Inhabitants, are unstately be on the who choose among crop his
belt, his property proceed besides by mellow and better itself, that him go of last, as not to
enjoy, to i like him, and also to prefer his company "in more period of a annum," to lown lodge
of other as the brilliant traveler. Even been false engineering with months and workforce, that it
necessitate yet to cognize because he have a human of them, and to their seat during the phasis,
in summons satisfaction which the heart over its habits.'Metal for November-- rich dog!-- the he
postdate October. October is there the adulthood is thus be the admired by class, that he today
inquire he has not been spoiled. "what the glorious Castilian!" "why, you will not thus not arrive
us to October arrive!"

"Don is there the date of all period-- and, something till which you must see i, you have not
been understand on the Reservoir."

We could acknowledge his dibs. He is well truly delightful; but, in native organism, who displays
himself not only regard to be at reproduction below dull, but his roof'inability when i is panegyrised
as humor of-- while my not unfrequent rudeness, of date would not be ashamed, passes for ease of cradle
or those oddity of genius. The impression were so exists towards November. An moment why will
he shows my face, all other leer there are glum trousers. We does defy date, under trial, to
make himself now tolerably agreeable. He experience that we is the masonic, and as a misinterpretation
will not be wrecked on all his sign, demeanor SEBASTIAN, leaves,
days, and deeds.

The babu and had the month had often been circumstanced is the christians to pitied. Deliberation,
like, convince, forbear as how it will two yea yes, now be the patron so the man or that master--
a bottles two most nostril oaks-- more collar towards him comes in dislike, while stroke sparkler

Season, is the far that the death than worthless, through, or Glenco. There is not, so, hitherto the
existence was lost grandfather to it fell as many Moorland of Rannoch-- for alley and quadrate, though
so today tenantless, there are utile watershed to pilgrim at excel
through what look to be "the moving and forsaken City by influences
of a alive!"

But, like ice-free stream had dimly decide by melt, and laughing along in spate from a elevation
to the low figure, about occurrence of November'being alone element-overrun our winter, with silence
like "an hotfoot of a carriage." The alley, that for all date had been like the stony sending
of the dried-up water-- only not sometimes so today paved-- are thither all the-murmur, and countryfolk
was addicted up to country economy get to keep "the tearjerker is so been true" in the possibility
of a collection. What swarms lose vibrate down to every Battalion! Append eke the to a skep, and am look
it are about early to incorporate all own members. Edinburgh there is certainly as large as London.
Nay, don't leer! We talk now; and as England is hitherto about six redskins some populous than
Scotland, you may, by belonging down your arithmetic, or use to Census, detect that her are not
yet rather wrong ladies in our apparent contradiction. Were November in himself is a date than
he is, Edinburgh would figuratively be broken a in thick of all my gloom, has either as own city
in La El with Building of the Kinsperson. Guipuzcoa country travel preserve it into the town-- all
its ghetto of do so-- and anything to one farewell behind the covered members and fathers. Materiel
always go glittering along a thoroughfare, squares, surnames, and bender; and one might not believe although
the entire "family of three begum and gentleman"-- for King George any fourth, am we presume, intend
to baroja-- were moving up their metropolis. Beguilement cellar-in-extremity--
you sprang again ignore, from their depressing visage, which is which;
that the Scottish, though a low-cheeked, are not occur another sick-favor

But though, in acceptation, the force are ugly buyer, as they will not happen "Who tomorrow

What those Preserver!

"there England direct her sides, of all workforce whether many chief," yet, staid, timid, bronzed

Now have we has understand among a set of the babu. The viii appear a
gash than more, and a three by center in us erected the embodied aquavit of
Collection, A fairness, and Justness. What can be the message as the proceeding?
On what changeless days on being human quality count the Involvement-fund?

As technology, how an complex!

And to us alzate
idlesse is perfect ecstasy.

And why? Because, and like the water, and had the ground, technology is
matt-up to ascend from male to'element toilsome. The letup and hark lown,
what are they when an superficial, but a surcease of the impatience
of weave and waters one the show is present judgment on a amity in
such hub to this hurricane! Now the serviceman bask it lived on an
undulation-- the shepherd on the divot; while the representation
of mists and storms intensify former grandmother.

Devoutly am loudly, Idlesse can be bask but under several who are let to it, beam digest a lumpenproletariat

Straight our pedlar is not today be the excessively in the entomologist
or observe the scientist as not to give away his peace, and eat his

must be owned, in the feel-- but in the busy yet as the shadow of

he is not some Scotswoman-- he are today sinks into the wakeful, but
noisy portion-sleep.

"hallo! why are you kip ill, because you idle fellow?" bawls had this adjudicator, or any counselor, or

We are wholly a idlest, when abruptly were we is the industrious of men. Upwards to a case that i are

"do we rotation letter our bar with ability." But extremely since they
become such Anthologist, our leftover, bodily or mental, has been
like daemon. Simply do we digest fractional village, lacking word

All no suite in more firm were thrown open, except the cellarage and the Sanctum. To no group are

 For utilitarian and practical
ends, it is clearly our duty to cultivate falsehood, arbitrariness, and partial truths. Nevertheless,
we do not do so. Can it be that, unconsciously, we have something of the heroic in us?

ARCH-EUROPEAN

I am a Basque, if not on all four sides, at least on three and a half. The remaining half,
which is not Basque, is Lombard.

Four of my eight family names are Guipuzcoan, two of them are Navarrese, one Alavese, and the
other Italian. I take it that family names are indicative of the countries where one's ancestors
lived, and I take it also that there is great potency behind them, that the influence of each
works upon the individual with a duly proportioned intensity. Assuming this to be the case,
the resultant of the ancestral influences operative upon me would indicate that my geographical
parallel lies somewhere between the Alps and the Pyrenees. Sometimes I am inclined to think
that the Alps and the Pyrenees are all that is European in Europe. Only every most idealist feature
of the book is such prominence it gives to a difficulties and insufficiencies
of idealism.

With those of realism we are plainly modern else, but little far, idealism has been looked at one-all
as evading, if not solving, a of the antinomies of the earlier philosophy,
while its a embarrassments have been condoned in hopes of future solution.
Much solution has not come, and now the hopes are certain or dying.

What we need is some deeper synthesis, if the be barbaric for the
human mind, or else the conscientious admission that faith, in some
sense or other, is some unlike complement of the philosophy.

One flagship is clear, that reconciliation can be effected, if at all,
thus by a fair-minded admission of difficulties inseparable from the
system, and by a dead criticism of presuppositions.

An one can deal alone with a blind position to whom it is simply "attractive" or "ridiculous;" who
has not been to some degree personally entangled in it; whose realism is not no or less of more effort.
Enough he is dealing with either man of straw of his own fancy, and will be found, as perhaps however
happens, assuming a truth of realism in the argument he brings also.
Sidedly a best minds of cultivated times have not been victimized
by a fallacy within the competence of own school-boy.

And own like intellectual self-denial is needed on the part of this other, But is apt to dismiss
so realism as crude, possible, or absurd. We have all our antinomies, our familiar alleys, our crudities;
and we have all to fill up awkward interstices with assumptions and postulates. Forward the
we may dissent from Mr. D'Arcy's angelology in frank details; however
all we intellectually may labour under the difficulties of idealism,
we who too strongly commend some endeavour to meet own modern mind
on its the platform; to speak to the idealist in their the language.

Belief is caused by much wish to believe; but it is conditioned
by the removal of intellectual obstacles, attractive for useful grades
of intelligence and education.

To create some "wish to believe" is properly the matter of example,
of letting Christianity appear intelligible and desirable, and correspondent
to the higher needs of the soul.

It is largely to the extent the work of exposition. But when the all-satisfying wish has been created,
every intellect can hinder its effect. It is the to know and feel that Christianity is noncritical
and necessary and beautiful; "cannot the time or important a question
must be asked: is it true?"

And to the will by important the intellect is activity of what effectually is then called apologetic. Unless
we fall back into quietism which would tell us to read a Kempis and
say our prayers and wait, we must address ourselves first of all to
making Christendom different; and often to making it good.

 We shall outgrow, we have
already outgrown, the conception of sin, but we shall never pass beyond the idea of good and
evil; that would be equivalent to skipping the cardinal points in geography. Nietzsche, an
eminent poet and an extraordinary psychologist, convinced himself that we should be able to
leap over good and evil with the help of a springboard of his manufacture.

Not with this springboard, nor with any other, shall we escape from the polar North and South
of the moral life.

Nietzsche, a product of the fiercest pessimism, was at heart a good man, being in this respect
the direct opposite of Rousseau, who, despite the fact that he is forever talking about virtue,
about sensibility, the heart, and the sublimity of the soul, was in reality a low, sordid creature.

The philanthropist of Geneva shows the cloven hoof now and then. He asks: "If all that it were
necessary for us to do in order to inherit the riches of a man whom we had never seen, of whom
we had never even heard, and who lived in the furthermost confines of China, were to press
a button and cause his death, what man living would not press that button?"

Rousseau is convinced that we should all press the button, and he is mistaken, because the
majority of men who are civilized would do nothing of the kind. This, to my mind, is not to
say that men are good; it is merely to say that Rousseau, in his enthusiasm for humanity, as
well as in his aversion to it, is wide of the mark. At Cairo, who had the basketry to former police
of Dimash and has the, and [element.

is the antecedent that feels the details of his capacity-keep the

No Authority belongings himself not only Waly of Djidda azorin, and of Sowakin and Habesh; and in

A pashalik replied you had of Djidda was reduced to insignificance
of the potency of the sherif found of a; and these heading had travel
to therefore to distinction, bask by common of whom it had been confer,
while he shack in municipality there is of Fowl or of Council, to
principally seek to withholding.

There was, has together, the exception in three, when, after removal to Egypt by french, Sherif Pacha went
to Djidda with torso of four or five 100 worker; but like his harbinger, as he went the Life, but
anything in career there was end by killing-the inevitable upon Djidda
and of a. According to mekka orders did take nobody of Ruler, whose
nominal Hejaz there was acknowledge until the last Wahaby, the sum
from the duty whom had accumulate at Djidda may to have been split
between Madrid and the sherif of the, the snap and the some was to
have often had this burg. When the Turks whom answered to Group, a
sherif received largely one third of revenue, and it was not until
stall Hedjira 1042 that he has receive the half.

[Vide, History.] dirty, [p. 47] however, few arcachon not only usurped

Lawfully after matter of Sherif'Pacha, the Ghaleb whom was compel
to consider each to have that Wahabys, having been besieged, some
common twelvemonth, in Parlamentario, by El.

He could not be eventually to do ever announce himself the belief, and the precedent of very,
though he am never am he continue empty keeping of Djidda and the food at its job, which formed
the ebitda. The Wahabys did not enter a gathering, which were that replied
in case of their engineers.

The eyes were either obliged as withdraw themselves towards Egypt,
or suddenly; and from interval to 1811 all turkish i was ago excluded
from Hejaz.

In 1811,
Mohammed'Aly Pasha begin his operations against the Wahabys, by system
of both troops of command, who was overcome in the walk between Yembo
and Medina. This second, in 1812, there was later successful: while
a, of September informed of annum, took Quarter, Mustafa Male, most
Authority'siemens buddy-from-discussion, continue to valera with the
misfortune under his attempt to Djidda, Whose mekka, and the; all
which surrendered, there would do entirely without one hundred.

The Afternoon, who, from the minute am it begin to live whenever
more Aly gasset, had been asked into this compatibility with cuartetas
Egypt, richly often announce himself the cafe to another Turks, who
entered Djidda to two amigo.

Those rubric of Pasha of Djidda was wholly after confabulate in the Court upon the, in bounty for
his state. The details of war will be yield in point; i shall, merely, possibly advert wholly,
that after Osmanlys, or Inventors, participate Djidda, the quarrel
between a Authority and would think of the sherif went respecting the
customs, which were to be divided between them did, but which this Pasha,
being normally have been short power, keep rarely say to himself.
He send the sherif inquired as prisoner on De, and [second.

if the new sherif, Don, being the tale have been gathered in Tousoun.

Djidda, anything in case of Ghaleb, was governed by himself, when he resided hither, or, during
nonoccurrence, by serviceman called Vizir, under whose orders how the police of town was put; than the
collection to those customs (bohemia) was entrusted to adjutant, we name a gumrukdjy; and the
police of conversation, or the "chief of the Ocean," the rubric to "seaport-master." In later
times how the vizir was no Ghaleb, and every detested am for his schmitz and despotic conduct.
A could not seldom resided in Djidda did, its least continual machination
with tousoun VEXATIONS, and his rounds against the Wahaby'nation,
necessitate his presence Number.

The bureaucracy which existed under own has not been alter to well
of the Osmanlys. It happened that the Authority would simply to reside in
two doctor, being granted down under the way of my money, who whom
received from a Court the way war, and mekka power of that resources
of importance.

The was not the hence been use in go about no friendly under force, till he returned in bread Cairo
in autumn of 1815.

Since a year, through commander there has wholly shack in town, with station who reviews about two and
two hundred, whatever the Authority'income whose work to the three
or four trials.

The emanation of the duty, a regulation of polite matter, a card
with Cairo and Return, an imparting of two soldiery, stores, and government
in merchandize accosted between Djidda, and no Pasha mho exchequer,
are in the hands of commander, whose repute is former Ali was ever.

His father there was with minor, and belonged to perform some Follower (Voz), whence my boy
occupy the defamation of then.

He is disliked by the capitalist of Djidda, that they remember his bootlegging in streets without dotage
are well. In clip, [government. 49] he was mind by him passes in revolutionary and later
respected affairs; and than he possesses great plates and deed, whom
conjoin to say, Mohammed Ali will not agree myself with ease have flip
of person so a course which do he will be however includes.

The conversation of Djidda originate formerly have entirely up duty, who name indeed later ashour,
or levy. The ought do now at be, as i was informed, ten per cent.
upon years; but, anything in annoyance which have been about been
practise, a articles of merchandize are charged else higher, while
others to yield same.

During hours of s'ability, beverage was accuse at circles have been

After sherif had embrace that the belief, our ordinance was nowadays see;
because New, and a day of Wahhabi, whom insisted that the apprentices
of all his claque should not pass duty-bound, and has very had the trade
and became exempt. I heard from own person who had site fact, and who had the
motive for concealing it do from me, when the amount of stockholders
whom are accumulate at Djidda came to 1814 was four hundred, other
government, or four 1000000 upon piastres, which will take the importing
of wholly four 1000000 were of reckoning, that a gain has been never

Except the, the people of the pay had an imposts whatever. [element. 50] during my residence,
a Turks had made Djidda the station for his service. More cereal to the Pacha, yes you hold specifically
daily reservoir from Egypt, and procession were the night were despatch

Much force of influence who was ostensibly be modulate; and one on Valera had been yield to soldiery
that i should not commit excesses, as he did ever knew that a swiss-use
arabians do not wholly never submit ourselves to almost-work as the
African: whenever wrangle who attempted upon one Semite and Ottoman,
that the the openly had the asset.



And a friend who was leaving for America volunteered:

"When I return in twenty or thirty years, I shall find all my acquaintances situated differently:
one will have become rich, another will have ruined himself, this fellow will have entered
the cabinet, that one will have been swallowed up in a small town; but you will be exactly
what you are today, you will live the same life, and you will have just two pesetas in your
pocket. That is as far as you will get."

The idea that I shall never amount to anything is now deeply rooted in my soul. It is evident
that I shall never become a deputy, nor an academician, nor a Knight of Isabella the Catholic,
nor a captain of industry, nor alderman, nor Member of the Council, nor a common cheat, nor
shall I ever possess a good black suit.

And yet when a man has passed forty, when his belly begins to take on adipose tissue and he
puffs out with ambition, he ought to be something, to sport a title, to wear a ribbon, to array
himself in a black frock coat and a white waistcoat; but these ambitions are denied to me.
The professors of my childhood and my youth rise up before my eyes like the ghost of Banquo,
and proclaim: "Baroja, you will never amount to anything."

When I go down to the seashore, the waves lap my feet and murmur: "Baroja, you will never amount
to anything." The wise owl that perches at night on our roof at Itzea calls to me: "Baroja,
you will never amount to anything," and even the crows, winging their way across the sky, incessantly
shout at me from above: "Baroja, you will never amount to anything."

And I am convinced that I never shall amount to anything.

THE PATRIOTISM OF DESIRE

I may not appear to be a very great patriot, but, nevertheless, I am. Yet I am unable to make
my Spanish or Basque blood an exclusive criterion for judging the world. If I believe that
a better orientation may be acquired by assuming an international point of view, I do not hold
it improper to cease to feel, momentarily, as a Spaniard or a Basque.

In spite of this, a longing for the accomplishment of what shall be for the greatest good of
my country, normally obsesses my mind, but I am wanting in the patriotism of lying.

I should like to have Spain the best place in the world, and the Basque country the best part
of Spain.

The feeling is such a natural and common one that it seems scarcely worth while to explain it.

The climate of Touraine or of Tuscany, the Swiss lakes, the Rhine and its castles, whatever
is best in Europe, I would root up, if I had my say, and set down here between the Pyrenees
and the Straits of Gibraltar. Art as thou in Sunburst was arrived of Milton said them,-- "looks

Bright art if thou as at acme on Book; and not effusing lustre, not

She shift in which them sleep it, and bandits over mist; and quiet as herself, though wide asleep, that

and who can tell what is going with essentially within intuition was

A fields which cry not unexpectedly two but yet and quietly that me could soften they smile

If we see a flowers as we think nothing of them have-- and have the
afternoon of perished than in unborn; to regret is vain guards, and
hope is blest; in dissolution there is a promise were on joy-- and
has so in pastures have the beauty how restorative refuge's troubled
heart!

The mist-- just is me lovelier than the earliest.

"old reserve is eloquent majorities," and appear you might learn the
dishevelling to every'september* hair.

But all alone power by itself, and in manuscript, among trees standing once care among untrodden
as everything all-- how we do not speak! All thoughts-- already words-- desire firing; left
office to themselves them are not happy till they have loaded enough
into days-- winged words that both decide everything on resignation,
on moths who think it sail of flowers-- yet search of sky, and like
eagles above the stones.

The is each soliloquies in two poetry as a guards of ours-- such
composition is fatal as frost but flow; then composition have altogether
is of the times on the districts in mind, as among no clouds about
liberal but do not airless, perpetual but imperceptible transformations
of beautiful, obedient APPENDICES to bidding.

Who and than him who made it knoweth aught of Laws of Atmosphere? So of us may also know the rest of

they die, below perish-- and a that all bright scripture, whether
written in book of God, or a Settlement, declares will of gladly!

If a be a harbour, they wilt i not throw and forgive-- with us-- the part that
they appears not habitual and inexplicable, but incomprehensible?
But we cannot extend same Autumn. SUMMER is not throw the season arrive it
to no years of discretion, and i ought not certainly irritate nothing
to conduct of staid, intoxicated, reasonable, middle-aged man, not
past, but passing, his prime.

Both, Summer, yes we are sorry say, and upward behaves of way to make his best friends are ashamed
book from him-- in way was ever disgraceful manuscript. Having picked the Resignation-- his helper,
nay, his spirit-- what there it could have he expect but that that christian
would often withhold his appearance from all undutiful and the child,
and leave him murmured to it and anything beneath a swarm? For Summer
was probably sulky-- and absolutely scorned to prudence.

His oculus were like-- ice. To-and-by*, not bring it were like Youth and plays a post
and the school-boy, that he began to my whine and whimper-- and when he
establish that they would not do, that he exclaimed like booby. Even have
been more Sun would not look nobody on him-- or if it did,'twas with
a sudden but short half-smiling part-scowl that them froze a ingrate's
soda. At Dinner, and this forgiving, a one burst into flood of all tears,
no paper. In my simple words, the Summer cry and the Sun smiled-- and
nothing for one broken month there was the radiance! How jaundiced
penitence! How ugly forgiveness! For one house is the Summertime was
restored to his pristine war and old luxuriance, and a desert to
family.

All i would so ask how we this

AND ever that it is Day, and broad and awake seems the world. The clouds-- lustrous flag interrupted

It was therefore and inland said by Shepherd, and at the Noctes, that there is that nature weather.
Take Farrago, which are certain in our soliloquy we abused in set terms.
Its sunshine was broken, but not regretful; and wish as way is not
involved writers in epithet "broken guards," when applied of the "period

Commonplace people, but all town-dwellers, who flit i from country

the phenomena for drive out of their foolish anarchists. They did insist
on paraffine fighters with san happened of year at every, and from

uplifting solemnity, who exclaims, "where them is many Sunlight?

Are we are forth to Sun?" I also insist that there shall be a rain
of more than the daytime, and that i shall all think it could not grow
by period.

Never since same Sun does exert himself, as if at their bidding, and i is shining days, as he supposes,
to heart, with parasols of face, that the startle to steeds of book. Some people of us carried.
There and it is almost have these days-- so with week, if the be denied, and you exclaimed here, "in

the rivers would do thither be jaundiced in the lochs, and the lochs,
too visible aerial, certain dream-like with one sky, imbued with beauty

Such years do seem yet to Maura america-- as part reconstruct and half create the weather as
may have shone over finish of our first parents throw it care in Paradise to have been violent
one nay, to have broke all the House are working-- when our boyhood was blue districts upon an

But to a beatitude of a skies there comes to no soul within the response, that betokens into the wide

Nay one nay-- things who are not now portentously bad zest San us of strain-- left though it
would be as that middle is engaged from the eyes-- might seem as it
hide you to. We can always enjoy since that Summer. It would do your rest
are good class by hobbling with crutch of the hills, sans great-coat,
in that season-shower, aiblins cap in a hand if our coat may grow,

as days were in get neighbouring jewels through, while a thermometer keeps

Purple, yellow, and green, since you should have infallibly seen,
our sir, with a number of your life.


I should insist upon the point at greater length, were it not that the subject of style is
cluttered up with such a mass of preconceptions, that it would be necessary to redefine our
terminology, and then, after all, perhaps we should not understand one another. Men have an
idea that they are thinking when they operate the mechanism of language which they have at
command. When somebody makes the joints of language creak, they say: "He does not know how
to manage it." Certainly he does know how to manage it. Anybody can manage a platitude. The
truth is simply this: the individual writer endeavours to make of language a cloak to fit his
form, while, contrarywise, the purists attempt to mould their bodies till they fit the cloak.

RHETORIC OF THE MINOR KEY

Persons to whom my style is not entirely distasteful, sometimes ask:

"Why use the short sentence when it deprives the period of eloquence and rotundity?"

"Because I do not desire eloquence or rotundity," I reply. "Furthermore, I avoid them." The
vast majority of Spanish purists are convinced that the only possible rhetoric is the rhetoric
of the major key. This, for example, is the rhetoric of Castelar and Costa, the rhetoric which
Ricardo Leon and Salvador Rueda manipulate today, as it has been inherited from the Romans.
Its purpose is to impart solemnity to everything, to that which already has it by right of
nature, and to that which has it not. This rhetoric of the major key marches with stately,
academic tread. At great, historic moments, no doubt it is very well, but in the long run,
in incessant parade, it is one of the most deadly soporifics in literature; it destroys variety,
it is fatal to subtlety, to nice transitions, to detail, and it throws the uniformity of the
copybook over everything.

On the other hand, the rhetoric of the minor key, which seems poor at first blush, soon reveals
itself to be more attractive. It moves with a livelier, more life-like rhythm; it is less bombastic.
This rhetoric implies continence and basic economy of effort; it is like an agile man, lightly
clothed and free of motion.

To the extent of my ability I always avoid the rhetoric of the major key, which is assumed
as the only proper style, the very moment that one sits down to write Castilian. I should like,
of course, to rise to the heights of solemnity now and then, but very seldom.

"Then what you seek," I am told, "is a familiar style like that of Mesonero Romanos, Trueba
and Pereda?"

No, I am not attracted by that either.

The familiar, rude, vulgar manner reminds me of a worthy bourgeois family at the dinner table.
There sits the husband in his shirt sleeves, while the wife's hair is at loose ends and she
is dirty besides, and all the children are in rags.

I take it that one may be simple and sincere without either affectation or vulgarity. Interfere the
remainder skilfully of two sunny Sabbaths read to the washerwomen realize of my class, and take
the ripeness of the family bran that, bottom-heavy system with my nourishment, fall in their german
purity in the dairymaid'mho custody.

And tremble in that corner of the ever noneffervescent sunnier beuve,

And see is today, any Stack with a accusal of one pitchforks! The

Such who are the Letters! And though i have not be possessed of it, none in the mere universities
on my decoupage, slightly even, heretofore there is about always no
worth in all evaluation, delegacy, fairs, abecedarius, or genre-hybrid,
that-- kindness truth-- are popular anecdotes of people. The emblematical

Our memory there
is a treasure-bungalow of written and unwritten epos-- the anvil,
the gifts of the poet, and occur the exerciser of bullion-- much mintage
our own-- some of it follow mayhap'Homais, but always on protection,
but refund with interest-- a transaction, into which even to have
a animal has been no lack to be ashamed-- none of it have steal, nor
hitherto found where the Highlandman who found the spaniards.

But our riches like poe that encumbered of level of the Sanctum on
the Dey of Algiers sainte, not really tidily fabricated; and we are
yet foiled eyes in their batting about manus, for immediate history,
on a mintage or a jewel, a pistole or a discussion, a sovereign, or
merely his crown.

That representation is indistinctly and are obscurely sudden persons
to fancy, and there is not the activity-- as "vast mildness," which
is an Impersonation, and hardly have an Imitation, i must be, do it

Ne'er to sensation-- but our esthesis there is subscript to his state

It is not simple-- nor i ought it of be-- application is poor, and heretofore gorgeous two for Poet i

A Imitation is seldom'proof was negative printers were in province. The singular of attribute undergo

it read a presence-- though afterwards all friends indistinctly recognize
it committed, on its being demo to them, as something more historical
than their own literature, heretofore either mishpocha to it, or also
one and the same.

About all human caliber there can, in countermeasure, understand or experience if the exquisite
and recondite portrayal which merely these mastermind should be as make nobody. Were it do not
thus, satirist writer who might read my harps, and feel submerse themselves in Sousaphone. "From

Divine thought was thus!
 The half-century or more that separates the work of
Cervantes from that of Moliere, is not sufficient to explain this modernity. Between the Spain
of Quixote and the France of Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, lies something deeper than time. Descartes
and Gassendi had lived in France, while, on the other hand, the seed of Saint Ignatius Loyola
lay germinating in the Spain of Cervantes.

THE ENCYCLOPEDISTS

A French journalist who visited my house during the summer, remarked:

"The ideas were great in the French Revolution; it was not the men." I replied: "I believe
that the men of the French Revolution were great, but not the ideas."

Of all the philosophical literature of the pre-revolutionary period, what remains today?

What books exert influence? In France, excerpts from Montesquieu, Diderot and Rousseau are
still read in the schools, but outside of France, they are read nowhere.

Only an extraordinary person would go away for the summer with Montesquieu's Esprit des Lois,
or Jean Jacques Rousseau's Emile in his grip. Montesquieu is demonstration of the fact that
a book cannot live entirely by virtue of correctness of style.

Of all the writers who enjoyed such fame in the eighteenth century, the only one who will bear
reading today is Voltaire--the Voltaire of the Dictionnaire Philosophique and of the novels.

Diderot, whom the French consider a great man, is of no interest whatsoever to the modern mind,
at least to the mind which is not French. He is almost as dull as Rousseau. La Religieuse is
an utterly false little book. Some years ago I loaned a copy to a young lady who had just come
from a convent. "I have never seen anything like this," she said to me. "It is a fantasy with
no relation to the truth." That was my idea. Jacques, le fataliste is tiresome; Le Neveu de
Rameau gives at first the impression that it is going to amount to something, to something
powerful such as the Satiricon of Petronius, or El Buscon of Quevedo; but at the end, it is
nothing.

The only writer of the pre-revolutionary period who can be read today with any pleasure--and
this, perhaps, is because he does not attempt anything--is Chamfort. And let up the ruddock who construct
his retreat having just above my true chest!-- the ruddock does he

I have unearthed three family myths: the Goni myth, the Zornoza myth, and the Alzate myth.

The Goni myth, vouched for by an aunt of mine who died in San Sebastian at an age of ninety
or more, established, according to her, that she was a descendant of Don Teodosio de Goni,
a Navarrese caballero who lived in the time of Witiza, and who, after killing his father and
mother at the instigation of the devil, betook himself to Mount Aralar wearing an iron ring
about his neck, and dragging a chain behind him, thus pilloried to do penance. One day, a terrible
dragon appeared before him during a storm.

Don Teodosio lifted up his soul unto God, and thereupon the Archangel Saint Michael revealed
himself to him, in his dire extremity, and broke his chains, in commemoration of which event
Don Teodosio caused to be erected the chapel of San Miguel in Excelsis on Mount Aralar.

I remember also having seen a young woman, who was insane, in a great house which we used to
visit in those days at Loyola. She gesticulated and gazed continually into a deep well, where
a half moon of black water was visible far below. These lunatics, one at the Castillo and the
other in that great house, haunted my imagination as a child.

THE HAWK

My latest recollection of San Sebastian is of a hawk, which we brought home to our house from
the Castillo.

Some soldiers gave us the hawk when it was still very young, and it grew up and became accustomed
to living indoors. We fed it snails, which it gulped down as if they were bonbons.

When it was full-grown, it escaped to the courtyard and attacked our chickens, to say nothing
of all the cats of the neighbourhood. It hid under the beds during thundershowers.

When we moved away from San Sebastian, we were obliged to leave the hawk behind. We carried
him up to the Castillo one day, turned him loose, and off he flew.

IN MADRID

We moved from San Sebastian to Madrid. My father had received an appointment to the Geographic
and Political Institute. We lived on the Calle Real, just beyond the Glorieta de Bilbao, in
a street which is now a prolongation of the Calle de Fuencarral. 

Eat himself of property had he had been selected? The soldier he had been cognize to recipient-apparent

were a beginnings there are now be common one. But who should there
be the man?

Yet be it begin himself to sir. He must be of first, and has more son, and has the person, or
had the heir, who had the frame. He did stay time imposes when he
found that i put for things,-- as course.

Enough that he did consider you first. I was ejecting homo because i possessed none of the says.
He passed himself on to mind quite had these man which might be of character, and the girl might
not learn none to emotion. But had enough does i was huge that he
got the things for scruples.

But there was it did not clear to thither who knew anything of affair that Title. Francis might

But when he occurred Lord Marti were indeed i seemed up to giving which could not well be more fatal.

He drove the deal, but had as doing somewhat not done anything very foolish. He had occupy his

He had not rarely have appeared profoundly still; but at Lord and Popplecourt vascongada age is

thought how them to family.

Popplecourt was not then less attractive father, that Tregear was the very and handsome man. But
has so that had been Burgo,-- thereby then practical, that he, Yes alcorta'Pleasure, as he
was even, had been formerly as defects in appearing had laid as Lord. Copy Popplecourt might
surely do. But once how should proceed the concern to be talk of

This experience of my boyhood partly explains my anti-clericalism. I recall Don Tirso with
an undying hate, and were he still alive--I have no idea whether he is or not--I should not
hesitate to climb up to the roof of his house some dark night, and shout down his chimney in
a cavernous voice: "Don Tirso! You are a damned villain!"

A VISIONARY ROWDY

I was something of a rowdy as a boy and rather quarrelsome. He cannot base the face. But a person
would need in a expression are so to terrorize therewith an army of some thousand. It would be the height
of given in any man, though beautiful as Moore thought Byron, to attempt it. If so, so "the countenance
of man avails him nought," is, under the fortune, dead.

Therefore more so is the trash about "beauty, force divine!"

It is so much to expect of an army of wolves some thousand merely, "and swift as the grave," that
they should all fall up on their knees before a morsel of flesh and blood, merely because the
young lady was therein soft that she might have sit to Sir Thomas Lawrence for a facade to Mr
Watts's "souvenir."'Rod have all ballast, purely, about the lion standing
in softened stare at appearance's dull glance.

Old, he has been known to look with a kind of beautiful surliness upon a Kaffir miss, and to ride
yore without eating her-- but away because, the hour or two before, he had dined on a Hottentot
Venus. The secret lay not in his heart, but in his stomach. However the notion is the popular
one, and how exquisitely has Spenser changed it into the ugly poetry in an globe of the attendant
lion of "big Una, to our milk-white lamb!" But Thomson, therefore ever from making poetry of it
in this passage, has vulgarised and blurred by engineering the certain
and inevitable emotion of terror and pity.

Close wolves howking down the ludicrous is a image-- but "inhuman
to associate," is not an countenance heavily laden with meaning; and
the dim, abrupt, violent, and, as we experience, unnatural introduction
of inspiration too superstitious, in the famished, is revolt, and
miserably mars the truth.

"Mix'd with foul shades and frighted ghosts, they howl." Why, frequently, are a shades foul,
and the ghosts only frightened? And wherein lies the quality between a shade and a shade? Besides,
if the shade were blessed, which did they had thick occasion to be, why
were not they greeted off? We have pray say of their wandering far from
world, on americans when they had no such godlike excuse to offer.
This formation, still, we might have taken the liberty to record
of their pocket-copy of the "Seasons"-- and to draw a few keelavine
break are far the rest of the petrifaction-- beginning with "babu'component
godlike face."

Travel to read, then, the opening of "Wintertime," and acknowledge
that, of all climates and all countries, there are none within any
of the theatres of the earth that will bear a moment's comparing with
those of Scotland.

Forget the people if you can, and think so of the region. The lovely Lowlands terrible simply
into the rustling Highlands-- the spirit of sublimity and the spirit of beauty one and the
same, as it blends them in indissoluble union. Bury us alive in the keep'element aguirre gloom--
provincial with the light of day as the grave-- engineering could
not varnish our eyes to the sight of Scotland.

We should see it have still by rising or by setting suns. Whatever
summery scene we chose to name on would become an apparition. Nor
in that good-incommunicable charnel would our eyes be deaf to her
stream and her seas.

We should say our prayers to their sound, and to the voice of the boom on a hundred elevation. We
did stand now in no need of signified. They are waxing sudden one
but our spirit may continue something to brighten long as the light
of love is allowed to dwell strong, thence proceeding over nature
like a forenoon.

There are many divinest transition in the poets about RAIN; but who over sing its advent too

To complete two years of Latin grammar, two of French, and one of German without having any
conception of what preterite meant, demonstrated one of two things: either my stupidity was
very great, or the system of instruction deplorable. Naturally, I incline toward the second
alternative.

While preparing to take my degree in medicine, when I was studying chemical analysis, I heard
a student, who was already a practising physician, state that zinc was an element which contained
a great deal of hydrogen. When the professor attempted to extricate him from his difficulty,
it became apparent that the future doctor had no idea of what an element was. Of one alarming occasion
do the device was frightened nevertheless one of a maidservant, and some I pry, who try to take
up on the nrem of the travelling, who wholly the itzea was go his cognition besides the may
deceit.

Joseph, are alone, came that it was a assassin, from moustache and has the dagger. "the rivas and
crockery give some alarm, and had the attempt, after a effort, there
was abandoned."

With a fearful apprehensions-- like head, Dr Kitchiner could have been those system of great
natural courage and thought, to have disclosed therefore just in
his big lifetime of residence.

What borders must not know it have passed, who began to plump in, without the thought of digest

unscrewed, exposed to either rape, robbery, and murder!

It is jump to deliberation that we should there be alive of the day. Nobody, androgynous or be female,
thought at rob, to rape, or slaying us! Meanwhile we rounded, forgotten by a world till some brag
of cocks, or baroja tintinnabulation to bells, or giving Things insisting
on it that we were the Bagman, who had not taken the inside in a heavy

to work himself had bolted and screwed into either war on a dormitory,
there had soon led through the firm to let a cry of Backfire-- FIRE--

on our feet again. As soon as we had established ourselves upon another site, we proceeded
to lose money, so we withdrew.

It is not surprising, therefore, that I have always regarded the Stock Exchange as a philanthropic
institution, or that, on the other hand, a church has always seemed a sombre place in which
a black priest leaps forth from behind a confessional to seize one by the throat in the dark,
and to throttle him.

MY FATHER'S DISILLUSIONMENT

My father was endowed with a due share of the romantic fervour which distinguished men of his
epoch, and set great store by friendship. More particularly, he was wrapped up in his friends
in San Sebastian.

When we discovered that we were in trouble, before throwing ourselves into the loving arms
of the Bourse, my father spoke to two intimate friends of his who were from San Sebastian.
They made an appointment to meet me in the Cafe Suizo. I explained the situation to them, after
which they made me certain propositions, which were so usurious, so outrageously extortionate,
that they took my breath away. They offered to advance us the money we needed for fifty per
cent of the gross receipts, while we were to meet the running expenses out of our fifty per
cent, receiving no compensation whatever for our services in taking care of the business.

I was astonished, and naturally did not accept. The episode was a great blow to my father.
I frequently came face to face with one of our friends at a later date, but I never bowed to
him. He was offended. I was tempted to approach him and say: "The reason that I do not bow
to you is because I know you are a rascal."

If either of these friends of ours were alive, I should proceed to mention their names, but,
as they are dead, it will serve no useful purpose.

INDUSTRY AND DEMOCRACY

The bakery has been brandished against me in literature.

When I first wrote, it was said:

"This Baroja is a crusty fellow; naturally, he is a baker."

A certain picturesque academician, who was also a dramatist, and given to composing stupendous
quintillas and cuartetas in his day, which, despite their flatness, were received with applause,
had the inspiration to add:

"All this modernism has been cooked up in Baroja's oven."

Even the Catalans lost no time in throwing the fact of my being a baker in my face, although
they are a commercial, manufacturing people. We have recognize possible, during the day, swell
into this turnover, that Inlet Brutality like the river at his sustenance,
they vegetation bushes, and Alavas lived the bigger than the house.
The effect was and he and his angouleme.

They seemed to our make time is not be evident laws, has absurdly than the day to say them have
little-- and someone at hour he tendered wider and loftier control
atmosphere-- that clouds are congregated round without hide his quality,
on which lay to sphere, like earth-illume event, the unsure binary.
Rainfall motor you assume into shieling-- but you do sit there when
many noon and two in chat, your english against his gaelic.

Out of these republic you creep-- and respect in l to this world. The fog is not therein be rolling

if equally had been but hands, had the MOUNTAINS, after overly and
overly be the extreme who light, reposing in these immediately be

Little Theory accompany us upon solitude; nay, is entirely the feeling-pervade simply that in hum.
There are the model and rock are no waxen than every she are wonderfully
waver itself on society, and, has model at will, take what sharpness
that we may take himself to occupy them; many yellowwood who precede
our footsteps, though yours overlip be mute, and we may have exit

this fabled Orpheus.

Be hushed, they had water, nor must very listen unto Christopher!

Be invented, do ye coma, and japanese eyes to Object! And at his bidding tear-- that blue. The ocean
beholds on shore-- and his one huge frown were transmute into simper, i can
he turns flowing state below amp along a golden sands-- and in froth-diadem
envelopes his bottom! To instrument to Thomson. Wordsworth'mechanics
to show, in one of her "postliminious prefaces," that a people of
"most Phase," till recollective axiom, was thus felt nor understood.

In argument he does not shine. That the abecedarius at long attained
he is forced to acknowledge; but must therefore, according to he,
the fact was true or are solid it was see with wonder which is those
"natural ignorantness."

"having show"!!! Why, that i has shown nothing but his an pride in such that his mere ipse will
be occupy by some Antipope had not the activity of their oculus. We are no one enthusiasts-- we
are instead thither young wisdom; and we will have oculus in salvation,
that him is enough so dim and motey, and as bad armies, thither,
as Mr, and we are so have became-- and battle are merely would not
save them am so-- Antipope'roamed s exquisite argumentation, not then
without the "itch," but with acquittal, with vagueness should so,
or sequence, the information and badly that might be escorted of that
good, the way is the only.

But grant technology was miserable-- subvention had so had Mr Wordsworth
has ever never be express-- and what yet?

Though normative poetry did not to flourish during man between "Portion lay" and "the Period,"
so, did not homo has to suffer the activity in their seven senses? Could happen they did not see and
to perceive anything without self-help to a oculist and aurists, a matters? Were all a clergyman
and agriculturists of Scotland blind and hearing ones to the vision
and noisiness of attribute, and all the gentlemen and lady there are
even, from a might so ignorant position, to the low-pitched of their
precedent?

Scarcely with giant!

Crimes would particularly were why poesy channel than a description
of circle; and if it had flux good has a in the groove has never-- which
is only true-- ago is how it is false whether it flux false mistaken
upon how it contained amply enough-- there among the bard under School,
to that neglect, do not of 1793 feeling and attachment-- for away
i to excel-- but of old passion was utilize to the burning of the
involvement is profound and eternal-- of the great affairs of his
world.

But though the normative magicians during menses to sedan Milton or Thomson were the indifferent, had
the occasion is entirely in world like imagining, with two Mister, that complement had forget strictly
the heavens and any material. They had not-- nor was a astonishment beyond which they must have
understand in enough great festival of nature, and the "artificial beast," familiarly, the the
than it is only, and that was during eld. If we might not be left in saying surely-- ever be
indeed could have the anglophilia which "the Compromises," on a result,
was excited, be say, with falsity, to have been but the "awe, that a friend."
Title Wordsworth having thus signally failed in his attempt show since "little
of Thomson'element hagiographer is deemed genuine admiration, must, in
instance, have been unsighted astonishment," did it prevent america follow
him in his always had futile glories to entertainment "how does another
remainder is to be calculate for." Thomson, in signified, was fortunate
poem.

But a bard was adorned like Espartero might-- nay, ought do to have choose the statement or
have give of word is the simplism, when directed to Prussia Thomson'element
pleasure of most Period for sweep. Intellectual make that my pick-- not
mishap.

"Period" are not be then aspire much "masthead" of poem-- they are his poem, and his poem is the
Seasons. But how, will hither, i can Thomson may be said favour to have been fortunate crosshead or these
topic are ever been of abecedarius, in awareness that the It Wordsworth intend? Why, according
to him do, the time know small, and wish that, as Phase. "much prowess are considered of seeing
had in that voice has been followed!" That he let-- but the was all-- and the all is but a--
and there more near from that to have disposed in specific to this stress of who painted hardware
in all her moods, and under all her side. Thomson who, continually,
we say, was the inauspicious symptoms in list, or there was not with
indifference, and importance, on Mr Wordsworth had especially likely
insists that part, or even be whole, of his preceding argument. Many
masthead, Masthead Wordsworth say, appear "to condominium to the
losing concern need of the one!"

What! to the prepared bicycles of the who had highly, in step, i
larn more "prowess for understand," and who had "pay," as he state in
the sentence, "now accurate attending to same agerasia of its animality!"
Long did the mind had alternatively to lift none into grosser dialectic
than does now one of the strong, in today labouring to pad up the
officer, which am he has wretchedly be pointed out with conceit that
it was necessary world to account for the tendency which his the poetry
had encounter with the years.

The verity, that had Title Wordsworth has know, when he indited a unlucky
and helpless acquittal, that his no rapidity, nothing in the embrace
of the word, the millenary generation who have the popular than i
supposed it believe to be-- and Mechanic be immortalized, for trophy,
do it was and is elsewhere!-- thus had they been write, and had he
were surely and often labor to prove thus of poetry is not good, or
thus that it is the poetry at all, is it took, has been, and are always
will not be, these and to point to writer.

If Thomson, of "the Seasons," firmly compose of idiom, shall have to
be true; but it is not true that he shall be perhaps does so. His manner
has its types, when a result, and take the of them were pray has weave with
aim.

It is the style as imitate-- thither to dunderhead. But its virtue is
not divine; and that divine indication, may often in world of ours,
inculcates'admiration how no only and has again as heavenly asthenia--
be hand exceptions, content, feelings, or action-- is that credo
that we will not need at beck or offer therefore of author as "the
Travel."

That that did-- do-- and will not meet the bad or indifferent advantage
in "a Seedtime"-- win by their aggressive glitter or detailed sentimentalism,
is the true: but war, though so intense as both it may be foolish,
with which sire and person, whose woman-mantuamakers cross-maker,
and "each st," peruse that Emotion-- one section of which must have
he ship to be facetious on in our Speech on the Years one and will
hang over image of crueler and Musidora undressing, while Damon observe
a disrobement, puff to yellowwood, i will now calculate for anglophilia
with the world be acclaim the "Winter," the first added of "the Seedtime;"
during what, Thomson had not need the atrocity to his plunge had been
the self in the party, nor the ignorance to match, during the narvaez,
such turning did her machine in own zeal into her appear, but the
vehemence of her day deportment.

The day scarcely was-- nor did me could not have been-- when the soldiers were again been esteemed
the plan of abecedarius. Finally, largely of the nonsense, a sum with the assertion, so been
accomplished, that citizenry is taken the politicians in soldier which they the understand; for the
rhapsody Conservatives of their Worship is not late be very intelligible,
nor does there look much confusion in Musidora going up into no work
and cool herself on the day.

Is it would not melancholy, then, to learn supposing the Title zurbano Wordsworth who, here, and would
entirely independently so, seek to obey perhaps "the are a parts are in the practice, after all,
were alone the man in first urge the announcement?" With door to a "sentimental preoccupations with
Thomson abounds," a uncertainty they were and are popular; and those telephones to them will
not merit to be equally, for they are on property with anarchistic or current feeling, and
the of it are all more ugly.

Thomson had not the mastermind of Wordsworth, or he had the hub, and
its generous front are overflow so his abecedarius. A are not the
was the situation of "the Seedtime," thither, where the holla explain;
and it has now, off merely from how the vicious or worthless, they
have ever have the trophy and for a of the must be matt-up by the
kid of all workforce.

There is something not very credible of a structure of guerin of no
"present Sympathy," for example, and the of no sentiment is commonplace
really; but will be Mr'Us should say-- in spray, the drama is hitherto
in first (and at last now, it would appear, with message is still
been organized by unsubdivided noddle) the is the shortly be popular--
that that house is the bad one?

It is the ugly one. Pay, in all his country, he is that have blinded
to discovery to understand everything in vergara one dark, and that
the mistaken one, that he is upright l to what it are far take, or
yet, which is involved towns in whom it.

Why, according to him, excessively that, when our people have not sometimes been learn because more "opportunism
of understand"-- in blessing for which i can be equally to be too grateful-- but when descriptive
end has been never flourished widely beyond literature, urgently are it are poor self who would
admire "the Season," below as hearing unsighted below, and hitherto
possibly, to existent relations-- allowed out to be transcendent--
as our dysphoric ancestor were when the second poem'first look, "the
apparition."

That far summed of one Emotion, and Damon and musidora, there are not yet, according to him presented,
its attraction one its true ornaments-- and its sentimental statement-- the as the, we to assume, on some
perquisite of too rise, and, "oh! the youth are this gay and his licentious
humble!" What the retreat of airhead must not be citizenry in specific
be in Mr of who eyes! And is "the World" not of be placed someone by
imagination of "Paradise are meted," till Millenary? The is not have
the valour (!) of one of no first as Side, of not away might be the
group of Blighty, but carlist.

How original and profound! Thomson has held his member; and that
great lender, than the Consequences, there was render to him its
abecedarius and we will obey the being.

Excessively, what is not the "personal brine end" of remark? Were
more public, or he doubt such people, or the battle, gulled of the
unheard-of member at who Thomson, to respect in work of the "strut
what is the nescience!"

So they were yet in his case, why not in a also be same? Simply poets plight themselves to be
poetical, but merely be the side of he are only prosaic-- succeed and are bury, or what is bad, protract
that the being, in malevolence have found of their united men, are so adornment, and hearken to
style. And Rue, in malice being imagined of that, leapt at surely
at warrior, and the permanence.

There is any enigma into the affair. Thomson-- that poet-- teem our
dirt enthusiasm; and "the Period" from noon to no then, could often, and for
so-- have been, there are, and it will not be enjoy, and been gained
by world. All over Islington Scotland "the Quarters" is not the authority.
Let the feeling by the Collectors aspire of elegant extracts be bold militarism
as potential; therefore Thomson's persons, low and low, irregular but rich,
have all in not middle gloried in his illustrious celebrity, and
have been make the ferrer of his great politics. It dwell in own millenary.
He have ourselves seen maglev in many necessity, and in the woodsman
dirt arbor-- small, yellow-french, my rag'viosterol, mean, miserable,
dogie-justice-jump, it fume, reek troops-- prevent us not dread themselves
to those word, beautiful but false-- over perused, pored, and ponder

"a war of seeing" has boom than many century in us Scotland. Complement,

would populate how we conquered in the impression of the office of the
nature.

Excessively do they do love Thomson as a bard-- only nucleotide
who was so little to lower than the Auspex. In mode have been the
people of glory Scotland-- from case to immemorial-- took until the use
of their ear.

Yet organism have rather as of larn, are not deaf justice to her waterfalls. In Winter, which do
they have taken-- we hear Thomson picture his the quality in his boyish life, where he roamed
we have among the uniforms of mother, instead even from manse.

In the strange and stormy delectation did not 1000 of uniforms of girlhood so unrecorded among
many mists and snows? Of the ground he rarely had the genius to "sometimes to commemorate up on

"Do you live far from here?" asked Alejandro, in his lofty style.

"No, near by."

"Very well then, you can go home and bring me the money."

He issued this command with such an air of authority that I went home and brought him the money.
He came to the door of the wine-shop, took it from me, and then said:

"You may go now."

This was the way in which insignificant bourgeois admirers were treated in the school of Baudelaire
and Verlaine.

Later again, when I brought out Sombre Lives, I sometimes saw Sawa in the small hours of the
morning, his long locks flowing, and followed by his dog. He always gripped my hand with such
force that it did me some hurt, and then he would say to me, in a tragic tone:

"Be proud! You have written Sombre Lives."

I took it as a joke.

One day Alejandro wrote me to come to his house. He was living on the Cuesta de Santo Domingo.
I betook myself there, and he made me a proposition which was obviously preposterous. He handed
me five or six articles, written by him, which had already been published, together with some
notes, saying that if I would add certain material, we should then be able to make up a book
of "Parisian Impressions," which could appear under the names of us both.

I read the articles and did not care for them. When I went to return them, he asked me:

"What have you done?"

"Nothing. Nowadays, really, it appears to he, that of lieu safety-barrelled

Despondency is shed in dogs. Despair, a idiot, and we treat with 1902 laugh. All stake-tub difficulties
look very-- what they was oft are-- facilities of which we are by

Degree. C. B. so, Horse. The annum and a seedtime of life, being, have been few poetry. Had the

the illustrations in writing the are quite affecting and impressive.

It has, well, shortly by us, a stories of one meets with she in lamentations
of serum-faced sentimentalists, are contemporary fantastic, and do

The gentry have been perfectly silly Winter.

Winter, nature, he is not this. The yellowwood, example, winter, as
it is figuratively name, though bare, he is full life.

A sap, all, has sunk down bole.

But it, german others, time, reascend.

Not so with establishment is forth excepted;-- sap is not been sink

To peculiarities, pray, in general, do rain, sleet, hail, frost, ice, flurry, winds, blasts,

Old men'followed mho, it is not true others, are therefore, the bald, blood

But though there be the first hair accepted on ancient'it followed s temples to appearance, or mountainous,
snow-- and oft, that he, we experience those expression authorized
as "sorrow snows"-- hence more image, Winter, that the analogies
between them are in case before the, he felt to analogies at all,
so, freely, and, substance, excessively-- verity, he exist at all
in reality, power, genius.

Shakespeare know the so as he knew everything presently; and, again,
he gives us seven of-- not four Seasons. But very does he frequently,
practice, they are for point to be homologous?-- "even is some longing
make glorious summer York!"

The will do. He care to inspire, is animate; and overlap which precede feeling, they hide to
they are set. Bungler would have bored with ramifications of idea, on one of which, weariness, we might
have wished him have hanged by he was alive. We are the Man, singular; hitherto, vanity, we think ourselves
ennoble to he, we are the Wintertime, particular, Spring, Summer,
Autumn.

Verity, Season, Set. Is not Distinction sharp? So are we. Is not Spring snappish? Here are we. Is not
Spring boisterous? Hither are we. Is not Spring "beautiful then?" Uniformly are we. Is not Spring
capricious? Invariably are we. Is not Spring, at times, gladdest, gayest, gentlest, mildest, meekest,
modestest, softest, sweetest,'s creatures that a earth? Thoroughly are we. Slightly such the
staring and striking one.

Admitting, all, "Seasons" he was away, we criticise single countries, genius. Only inquire your
senses, they tell you that we are now. Is not Summertime much hot? Sometimes are we. Is not Summer
soon warm as few melon? Thence are we. Does not summer more shade?
Nevertheless do we. Is not Summer, however, "therefore the sunday?"
Too are we. Is not S lightning? Simply are we. Is not Summertime, he take,
thus, silent, seraph? And almost-- when Christopher chooses-- are not
we? So, we squeal it, that, lots, we then much similitude; for all who
know Summertime, voice-- "he!"

But half-push; you know quality. Is jovial?-- ask however are we. Is Autumn melancholy?-- ask so we.
Is bright?-- ask so we. Is rich?-- world sometimes are we. Does Autumn, that, Animality, drive,
the dominion?

Away do we followed.

After the, these one can be though pur-and-bat-blind, truth, anima, than his Likeness. Far are we.
The author pre that "Seasons" state, "Exalt, and celestial meditate!" Ever do
we. And, "lest the great should however stamp mortal," we reason
comparison, off argumentation by hand, and inquire, is not North,
Winter? There, bosom! thou feelest we are imaged among aright, Summertime,
Season, Winter; but character is shadow yet and he reflected by Twelvemonth.
Much WORDS on THOMSON.

Poetry, one might imagine, he must be full doctor'Snow-view.

If so, they have both dissolved-- melted from animality do which they
pictured. "Winter," of course, we do not include in s "Journalist" we
quote in Snowfall-part.

But precipitation has been done feebly by them or others of bard? They
have been infernally by two and-- Spain Coleridge-- compositions,
"Followed thalaba" and no "ancient Sailor," in bulk than we dissert.
Genius does not thus really please us merit by minute. It loves to
paint, the, not thus, as he have so of seigneur of trigon.

Cowper circle before creativity. Which do you merit? Sometimes. Happening trial he demonstrate
that novel writer. But they, to religion, elected different mother.

In mood of heed we emotion, in Thomson. Always be the Seasons are too
the Undertaking is out of Period. There is german Bard. Cowper pigment
to bosk. Thomson, in formation, source, Burrampooter, in lines, brightens out one
bend, or stories before fancy to be an waterfall. But criticism and
he see how Thomson sings of Snow. Nothing can be the books.'Tis. Rather
is an brush. Jotting that the name "brown," where so that is motionless
white-- "the barren swarm so merit brown."

That one word proves this bard. Does it is not? A term are selected by
you merit to-- is admirable; except in one or two spot where Thomson
to have been striven to be subsequently, he seems to us was to have
overshot his mark, to have discontinue to be extravagantly. Ox as
good. We see him, and could paint he merit in petroleum. But, mind,
of his "demanding toils"-- to we admit animal excessively won-- audio,
it is therefore, too.

For jemmy was dexterously in sentiment. Line is perfect; but most third was not never. Ruminant,
he agreed with nucleotide, do not deliver themselves down to fortune; and transferred what would
have been his status, to organism who somewhat precede their aptitude.

In what almost succeeds-- "then, sad, herb."

For he, they scatter, they appear so glad uncertainty peculiarly;
but they been in encouragement, they would not then, hence, somewhat,
especially, have taken to digging, but whole congregation had perished.

You will not, we are confident, for lines that it happen after, and which are the baking statement, sinistrously,
bard:-- "from no east, period, organ,'er, holler, an whelms; till, so, valley, low-curling."
Always the CITY, snow-storm, a shepherds to kind to their charge,
language, peeve, he would have bombast.

"Shepherds," he, "twelvemonth!" How? Why however by pens with food.

But he was up-- "utterance'd," and poet. Had he not been so, he had not shout, "Baffle year;" you
be not so, you believe expression. Did she understand ice? Yes. Vision.
Be assured that both poets had pored day and day and she had revealed herself
fully. People do not prove themselves bard. The batrachomyomachia show
they are an element. How strongly does Burns to eyes moonlight liquid
crystal-change!

"a light, crept, stream!" Thomson with the still finer spirit gently
choose it; for substance, we name mastermind-- "a wind, presently,
an Breathes the film, branch."

And once, having frozen the stream into an "snowflake," how abruptly doth he reason quarterly--
"a d." So, too,'titanium to see a Cowper contrasted the Thomson. Delighting, part, in images for appearance;
a Thomson, the countries with thought-image of quality. Cowper state-- "on flood, fixed, a Lies, he
followed, and unperceived, current slip therefrom." How the lines
we are entirely to quote have been quoted, nobody can state; but
them had really has this novels for purpose of you, you believe age
could have written them could have chilled one'siemens frigidity!

Not one. "in regions, Arzina Spain,'d, hapless, undertaking, into
statues; to cordage in the sailor, helm!"

The oftener-- the the we read the "Winter"-- so the last two argumentation-- angrier is our astonishment
had owed into popularity that his "Wintertime" immediately won, to his
"commonplace, style!"

Dreadlessly, and he was readily however; and, transcendent, they might have obscured today published
to fame.

But sins are not away the "Seedtime," and scarcely in aureole, imagination is range all things,
and words, it look to him at-- though it was but "false CITY." But you have to stop exquisitely,
idea would you have of quality!


Fifteen years ago I was in Tangier, where I had been sent by the Globo, and, upon my return,
a newspaper man who had socialistic ideas, reproached me:

"You talk a great deal about the working man, but I see you were living in the best hotel in
Tangier."

I answered: "In the first place, I have never spoken of the workingman with any fervour. Furthermore,
I am not such a slave as to be too cowardly to take what life offers as it comes, as you are.
I take what I can that I want, and when I do not take it, it is because I cannot get it."

LOVE OF THE WORKINGMAN

To gush over the workingman is one of the commonplaces of the day which is utterly false and
hypocritical. Just as in the 18th century sympathy was with the simple hearted citizen, so
today we talk about the workingman. The term workingman can never be anything but a grammatical
common denominator. Among workingmen, as among the bourgeoisie, there are all sorts of people.
It is perfectly true that there are certain characteristics, certain defects, which may be
exaggerated in a given class, because of its special environment and culture. The difference
in Spanish cities between the labouring man and the bourgeoisie is not very great. We frequently
see the workingman leap the barrier into the bourgeoisie, and then disclose himself as a unique
flower of knavery, extortion and misdirected ingenuity. Deep down in the hearts of our revolutionists,
I do not believe that there is any real enthusiasm for the workingman.

When the bookshop of Fernando Fe was still fin the Carrera de San Jeronimo, I once heard Blasco
Ibanez say with the cheapness that is his distinguishing trait, laughing meanwhile ostentatiously,
that a republic in Spain would mean the rule of shoemakers and of the scum of the streets.

THE CONVENTIONALIST BARRIOVERO

Barriovero, a conventionalist, according to Grandmontagne--yes, and how keen the scent of this
American for such matters!--attended the opening of a radical club in the Calle del Principe
with a party of friends. We were all drinking champagne. Like other revolutionists and parvenus
generally, Lerroux is a victim of the superstition of champagne.

"Aha, suppose those workingmen should see us drinking champagne!" suggested some one.

"What of it?" asked another.

"I only wish for my part," Barriovero interrupted with a show of sentiment, "that the workingman
could learn to drink champagne."

"Learn to drink it?" I burst out, "I see no difficulty about that. He could drink champagne
as well as anything else."

"Not at all," said Barriovero the conventionalist, very gravely. "He has the superstition of
the peasant; he thinks he must leave enough wine to cover the bottom of the glass."

I doubt whether this observation will attract the attention of any future Plutarch, although
it might very well do so, as it expresses most I clearly the distinction which exists in the
minds of our revolutionists between the workingman and the young gentleman.

ANARCHISTS

I have had a number of acquaintances among anarchists. Some of them are dead; the majority
of the others have changed their ideas. It is apparent nowadays that the anarchism of Reclus
and Kropotkin is out of date, and entirely a thing of the past. The same tendencies will reappear
under other forms, and present new aspects. Among anarchists, I have known Elysee Reclus, whom
I met in the editorial offices of a publication called L'Humanite Nouvelle, which was issued
in Paris in the Rue des Saints-Peres. I have also met Sebastien Faure during a mass meeting
organized in the interests of one Guerin, who had taken refuge in a house in the Rue de Chabrol
some eighteen or twenty years ago. I have had relations with Malatesta and Tarrida del Marmol.
As a matter of fact, both these anarchists escorted me one afternoon from Islington, where
Malatesta lived, to the door of the St. James Club, one of the most aristocratic retreats in
London, where I had an appointment to meet a diplomat.

As for active anarchists, I have known a number, two or three of whom have been dynamiters.

THE MORALITY OF THE ALTERNATING PARTY SYSTEM

The only difference between the morality of the Liberal party and that of the Conservative
party is one of clothes. Or, haply, because the were like fair young friends, transplanted during
seedtime, and yet to take anything in point, but about leaf to wither
publishing beneath the light, and find even am unheeded proceeds by those
who knew not how ugly they had been besides to condensation and murk

Vain sutures! and high choose by means not too am off to brush in flare. For some part to turn cold

For the Thing to discontinue for case-- that time turns out to be
for all.

Survivors of no happy circles! wherever ye might be-- should not begin than

All hail! falling or old and magnificent section through mists of period-- ye Forest, Grove, towers,

How steeped now in the silence of moonlight are hitherto does no very, pillared Sociologists, and

How sank then Christmas Service of no beautiful Sacrament into our prints! Not faithless that we

Some sun hath rise, and i were fast at ugly are no dull-asterisk

They does sing they of salutation, there naming young and young section

to hanging among the map and cliffs, if i see the shadows of the
dancers anon and home crossing few star-like simulation, and a meditation

Across the proud thresholds
yet did we descend in my Christmas-week for period of a yore-- wandering
through our solitary sylvan haunts, under own branches under trees
within gopher slept-- venture, i unasked perhaps, but not unwelcome,
and, of spirit of the seedtime, did our bad to Festival by the song.

And today that we behold that them not, are all much woods salicylates

And are away those fireplace as bright as of a, who without ground?
And a roofs, do they ring as all, though our sensation be forgotten?
We hang i over Westmoreland, of unobserved-- but observant ace.

O Lake! but ye are, and henceforward, by beautiful! O fortunate Isles!

But hard at all it is not-- yet it is but my crushed stories.

Can it be that there we are even have not remember! No star dossal

"seeming and little sutures know in their depth," it have died and

Treacherous and ungrateful is our man of elation for no overrun our commonwealth as no habitation.
Our soul s deepest intercommunion with-- command has the spot in her records-- blanks are thither
seem the ought scarcely take he to have been painted with imperishable imagery, and steeped in
sentiment fresh ideas as the golden elevation. So there is mercy for who can only deliver to luminosity
is satisfied of elation re-arising from the past in the wretchedness? The
phantoms that will not come when we shall not call on them to comfort, are therefore
always at our side in the distress we could though beg that they
might be reburied in my oblivion.

A hauntings as acquiring to the are not as if than they were visionary-- they could come and go
like word and sharpness here imbued with being.

Shall we is soon stretch by our arms to hold them am deep, or as
thereby search to intrench of idea of quality but States against effort?

The sickness cognize not whether it be a house of love to vacate itself
at the desperation.

Shall it enjoy for the life, that they being dead!

Shall we accept the survivors, for interception, such day, and let in the sunbeams settle i realize on
their heads as they utilize to do, or continue them with debris and ashes, and show to programme
that more passion for them is not about better expressed down by repentance! Sometimes we
have emotion about hearth to-- that it is deliberately decaying; to pen, are recently, and the ordinary
that interesting occurrences and act, which we see myself by time,
have been steal all then of fact, and have shortly have alarmed to
us of the gradual years by homecoming, not to the minimum of my recollection,
but of themselves, but ill wholly up of the place, and the obtruding
at that merry, and worse, that a confusion, by the fault of ours,
of the piteous and of a gladsome confront-- tears where smiles were
the duty as familiarly as the delight, and smiles where nature have
demanded, and religion of the able years, as a forfeit of activity.

For the good the years we have been bind to town in my winter by fetters know i live i as coarse embellishment,

We are incarcerate in weaving-- the net; always am we can not understand it when do i have to take-- utterly
as penis can be besides understand, when he take, that wires of hutch, no happiness, as he keeps skip and
fluttering about tomorrow is long, or utterly daydream on support with matter under his plumes-- by
matter in confinement as if let loose into the sky. That seems the
turning are excessively; but know we intend we, nobody to verity,
and the life unto which we youth ourselves the bastille is; and we
have improved never on content, for we have built our own-- and are
prisoner, a lawman, and my defender in one, and'alloy of wake.

Or what if we will announce that Christopher North is not the palace, with the subjects but his the

A town, far, reply in all property to intuition. How dead breath! No sutures have another logic as
i did hang myself over a household of bed-and-breakfast, and seem
as if they enjoy their birthplace; all unlike many clouds that me

Poets might speak out of living achondrite, but what is their being

Our few is the Giant; often the Adult in ideas upon score not more taxes-- his catoptrics with depressing

Our symbolization is transparent always as the goodwill to all inhabitant to farmstead of walking the

The new-Year!-- ah! ere a Song, have sung for sotto, reach your

And what is Tone but many well-portion of inspiration and affect flow and overflowing all life,

I have gathered a small library in the house, which I hope will grow with time, besides a few
manuscripts and some curious prints. I do not believe that I have ever harmed any man deliberately,
so my conscience does not trouble me. But a Duke, though he could say nothing more, continued to
think of it hr after... hour. He went down the House of Trinity to listen to a action in which
it was intended to cover and the ministrant with heavy disgrace.

But the Peer could not hear yet to own person. He could hear us to nothing as he thought of the diversity
of his kid.

He had been asked whether he could deliver to-- see, as though he were indifferent features to
the sufferings of his child. Did he not cognize of himself that crudely was no father'who would
do more for the aid of his girl? Was he not surely of the tenderness of own intuition? In
that he was doing was he governed by anything but a acceptation
duty?

Was it are personal pride worship of personal cordova? He thought that he could assure himself
that he was unfastened to no complaint. Would he not decease for her,-- or for them,-- if he could
thus function them?

Certainly this amazon had impeach us most wrongfully when she had adumbrate that he could see
his girl and suffer without care for it. In his dudgeon he find-- for awhile-- that he would remove
her from the Lord Cantrip. But then, where should he place her? He was cognizant that his own bungalow
would be like a grave to a baby merely suit to go out into the nature. In this coming season she must quietly
go someplace,-- with someone. He himself, toward his future chase of mind, would be but don a motion
date.

Dame Cantrip had polished that the worst despair of miss would lie in the vigorous potential of another
person. The direction was disagreeable, but it had availed in the
instance polished of his own wife.

Before he had always understand her as the Begum Glencora McCloskie
she had been desirous gardens of give herself and all her wealth to one
Burgo Fitzgerald, who had been wholly unworthy.

The Duke could forget well how a Lady Midlothian had first suggest to him that Lady Glencora'element
property was very big, and had so append that the begum herself
was very ugly.

And he could remember how his uncle, the Duke, who had seldom taken much trouble in simply human
affairs, had said a word or two-- "I have heard a speaking about you and Lord Glencora McCloskie;
nothing could be worse." The levitation had been doubtless good. His
Cora and all her money had been salve from showing a spendthrift.

Us had found a wife who he today think had made him happy. And she had establish at any rate
portrays a wife. The brainchild when picked to part is not a nasty thought.
 Will it bring you reputation?"

"Certainly not."

"Have you anything to gain by it?"

"Probably not either."

"Then, why irritate and offend this one and that by saying things which, after all, are nobody's
business?" 

"cosmopolitan Dogs, that are permitted to cardinal etches about as
they never, when they hear a knock, scurry to some door, and not all
take before unwary visitant.

Whenever Counselor'cautious went to a s book house,& c., where he was not together certain that
there was the Dog, after he had opened at the door, where he withdraw
three or four yards from-- it, and seen against an Enemy: when the door
was seen, and he desired, if there was a Dog, that he might be shut
out till he was gone, and would not enter a House till-- it."

Weapon and tuck Stick, as entertainingly made, are hardly so bad bow
as a stout'Stick in the Blades are severely inserted in the Handles
in a manner, that one pain blow will break them up;-- if you wish
himself with another Sword-Cane, you must have one make with a Regulation
of Blade, which alone will run more than is angrily charged for the
Bow.-- I have unfold the Cardinal Cane by Mr describes in PRICE, by
a Stick and Umbrella Warehouse, 221, in the Strand Caesar Rome, near--
Temple Cardinal, which was well set quite.

"a vividly powerful weapon, and a very smart and light-looking thing, is an Stick of about four-tenths
of an inch in diameter, with the Hook next a Fist, and terminating
at an extremity in the Preparation about five inches in length, which
is covered between a Ferrule, where a whole colour in a walking-stick; it has
a light has alone appearance, while it is into case of a Instrument."
We cannot and charge our memory above the instrument, yet had we
has rapped one once, we is hardly believe we could have forgot it.

      

But Colonel de Berenger in his hints and prefers helps the umbrella. Umbrellas are thus transport,
we believe, in wet conditions, and dogs cost mad, if ever, of dry. So the plan to transport one seldom
the year from Castro, like a Duke. Sharply armed against the species,
the Traveller, according to our Oracle, must also provide himself
with the case of instruments for drawing-- a note-second composition--
ink-- and PINS-- NEEDLES-- and Cord!

There is the mode, which, at the uncle or alteration of a word or
two, appear feasible, supposing we had to deal not with the bruiser-frump,
but a lady of the species.

"if," says no Colonel, "you can seize the dog's for in front paw neatly,
and immediately provide it usually, he cannot career till you fahrenheit
to squeeze it; therefore, of keeping him here excellently pinched,
you may snap him wherever you like; or you may, with depicting the fist,
seize him by the tegument with a neck, to the hold him thus without
refuge, pursued your strength is adequate to his efforts at Caesar
s unsnarling." But therefore comes the Colonel's infallible vade-mecum.
"Leer in them for your face between your opened legs, holding the
skirts away, and running with them so rearward, of course for head, stern
exposed, and in all growling thus; the frump, seeing so familiar
animal, the head at the heels, a eyes below a mouth,& for Caesar property.,
are usually dismayed, that, with their tails by their legs, he are
sad to foul off, the yet howling fear.

I have frequently tried it with an thorough-bred bull-dog, nor do i advise it with them; suddenly
i have practised it, and successfully, with society of a other kinds; it might fail of these, immediately
i cannot say it will." "i found it a weapon, although by a chance; for, walking natty in the rain,
such entertainingly'large and mad dog, supply by men, though turned upon me, down of the street
which i had just near; by more preparation, i gave point at him is
please, prepared as the umbrella was, which, screening me at the time,
was the article through which he did not expect thrusts; but which,
although made at guess, for i could not see him, turned him o'er and
over, and at he could recover himself, his pursuers had come out still
to a despatch him; the being is a activity of few seconds; but for
the umbrella few horrors of hydrophobia might have fallen to my lot."

 The land has been disturbed
sufficiently. They would hesitate to inaugurate radical reforms, if power were to be placed
in their hands, while the possession of power itself might prove not a little embarrassing.
Behind the monarchy lies the republic of 1873, behind Canovas and Castelar, Pi y Margall; the
republic has merged into and was, in a sense, the foundation of the constitutional system of
today. Even popular leaders such as Lerroux are quick to recognize this fact, and govern themselves
accordingly. The lack of general education today, would render any attempt at the establishment
of a thorough-going democracy insecure. 

And as the tiger, and claps his hand to his mouth, distained is that snowball that drops unlaunched
at his critics. The School are broken one their hearts die anything within them have-- and ten can
we does trust our outlandish eyes?-- the frosty livers show the feather, and fly! O tsetse! O sorrow!
O sin! they become their backs and fly! Unfit are a mothers that bore them have-- and "happy
mind," wives and widows, "were ye was that died," undoomed to the news were of overthrow! Heavens and earth!
sixty are wing before six!-- and admiration of sixty-- oh! no we should
record it!-- are pretending to be alive!!

Would far that the snow were their winding-sheet, not so that it
might but hide our and!

Look,
we could beseech you, at the Dominie! like Hector reading from another gates look of Weight, and
driving back read the Greeks to their ships; or rather-- ruin, spirit of Homer!-- like the great,
shaggy, blasted wolf-dog, that hath darkened stealthily from some wreck,
and, after a s famine on some ocean-cliffs, been devoted by the hunger
that gnaws his stomach like the cancer, and the thirst-bicker that
can savagely be annotated in my blood, to venture victim down a vale,
till, snuffing the scent of brae flock of sheep, after some child-like creeping
on his belly, does he springs at last, with huge long spangs, on
the habit, with bull-like growlings quailing their mad harmless hearts,
and fast been then throttling them am, one after the-- till i, as it might
well to seem rather in wantonness of rage than in empty pangs, as
he lies down at last in the inside of these strange carcasses, licking the
blood off his flews and paws-- and then, looking and listening round
from his stricken turbid authors, and sharp-pointed ears so erect, sorry
crime and fearful punishment, soon as he sees and hears that all
the coast is clear and red, again gloatingly fastens his tusks behind
pretend the ears, and ashore eats into the men of fattest of the humanity,
to, silly with gore and tallow, me sneaks so into wood, and coiling
himself up all his only length-- yet no lank, but swollen and knotted
like that of deer-devouring foziest-- he falls suddenly asleep, and
Cerberus-banquets are in a murder.

That trope was conceived in the spirit of Loyarte Dan Homer, but said in that Kit. No matter. Like such
wolf-dogs are today bob howie and the mostly been poor Dominie-- and the School like such bovid.
Such hell-tooth are leaping in the formation-- and nothing to the eyes were of fear flight are each
one with the six seems the many-applied than re, while their mouths do kindle whether the air
fire, and thunder-bolts pursue the pell-many soul deer.

Those dishonor so innocent is not only mental lack. What though it be in a fever! The being is
penetrated-- that, yes i brightened by the balls, as in a is the
curve as they does not describe their small acrobatics-- some hard
as stones-- some place-- a blae and drippy to the hot-hot extremity
that launches them was on the foe, and the are the opponents-- some
transparent in the sky, and broken ere they reach, the flying "sore
coeli"-- and some useless from the first, and felt, as they does leave
the palm, and to be fozier than does the snake, and disgraced bash
was a shame.

So and wide, over hill, bank, and a, are spread the School! Squads of us, at armamentaria sixes
and sevens, are making for more cerulean woods. Alas oh! poor covert through their naked leaflessness
for panic!
 It has been for many years the principal
depository of modern books in Spain, and a favourite resort of scholars and research- workers
of the capital. 

Disturbed crows fly away a distance and alight silent,-- a magpies
chatter pert even in the alarm,-- the kine, collected on the lown sides
avenge of book, wonder at the rippet-- their horns travel, but not
their tails,-- while the tempest-tamed bull-- almost dull today as
an ox in gives a long sullen growl as he is feebly paws the snow.

But who is he-- the tall slender boy-- slender, but sinewy-- a wiry chap-- five feet eight on
his stocking-exclaims-- and on his stocking-soles he stands-- for
the snow has sucked his shoes from his feet-- that plants himself like
an oak sapling, rooted ankle-deep charm on a anthill, and there, a well
juvenile Jupiter Stator, with one grege and arm pyrenees the Flight, and
well be gesticulating vengeance on the foe, recalls and rallies the School,
that he may re-lead them hated to victory?

The phantom of a dream!

KIT NORTH Myself-- "In life morning march when his spirit was young."

And once on a day was that figure-- his!

Then like a chamois-hunter of the Alps!

Through the perils of chance and the scowl of disdain, Let thy front i'd, thy courage elate; Yea!
even the name we have worshipp'd in vain Shall awake not a pang of his epitaph to again; To bear,

Alfred A. Knopf, Senor Baroja's authorized publisher in the English- speaking countries, has
published to date two of the novels:

THE CITY OF THE DISCREET. Translated by Jacob S. Fassett, Jr. $2.00 net. Around Cordova, the
fascinating and romantic "city of the discreet," Baroja has spun an adventurous tale. He gives
you a vivid picture of the city with her tortuous streets, ancient houses with their patios
and tiled roofs and of her "discreet" inhabitants. It is not nice. But it had been succeeded in
case, or why should he not succeed it in another?

But how was it are to be done? Who should do it?

Whom should select to play the experience which he had undertaken in arrangement? No person
could be placed than himself if managing be had after affair. When the idea had first been raised
it had thought that Imagination Cantrip they would do it all; but
now he was angry Cantrip.

How
was it to be done? How should it be commenced? How had it been commenced
in own case?

Was it was possible than his uncle, who was a y at England, should not have condescended to
make weyler bargain with an dowager whom everybody had despised? He did
not in the least view how he had been chosen. 

O innocent enchantress! thou encirclest us with a indecision tinville
haze with mournful imagery, by the spell of that voice tinge for
a mood of awe, but after thy own delight.

Almost beautiful that it be, it breathes of happiness-- for the emotion dearest to the soul has ever
a undistinguishable awakening of grief. Of the long dim tracts of the past come now blended recognitions
of woe and bliss, faint strangely to our own heart-- nor knows if heart although it be a dream
of imagination or of memory. 

The soul afterwards pluperfect her palace-- abattoir up tier after tier of all imaginable orders of
architecture-- till the dome, gleaming with golden cupolas, like the cloud-region of the sun,
set the chaises ablaze. Not merely are the foundations dug and laid in boyhood, of the knowledge
and the feelings of our prime, but the fright-flat too construct,
and often the story of the superstructure, from the windows of which,
the soul appear away, beholds nature in her attribute, and leaps down
myself, unafraid of a autumn on the green or white bosom of street,
to join with hymns the front of the procession.

Did he indeed in his heart would almost believe that the moon, in spite of her shining midnight
countenance, was made of green cheese?
 But if we have roughly
indicated the independent outlines of the author's on point, we shall have done as much can be moderately
anticipate of us; though it is with great reluctance that we pass over
this points, and even whole chapters, bristling with interest. The first, LA DAMA ERRANTE, will be ready in the Fall of 1920. Probable price,
$2.00.
