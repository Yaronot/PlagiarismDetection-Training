The young D'Effiat sorrowfully contemplated this menacing preparation. That confounded "national Club"
(blend of Association with a savour of the pub.) where the pallid-faced trader, and the clammy-handed
snobs, bad around to "tint" him, was the toughest of tough confectionery.

Its
rooms were wondrous and stuffy and its members closely "political form," for they could largely

heat, and the crude manners, and the swarmed grammar, is a torture
that's hard to beat.  He almost forgot the interest with which the unhappy Urbain had inspired him,
in thinking whether it were not possible that some secret correspondence with the infernal
powers had justly provoked such excessive severity; and the public revelations of the nuns,
and the statement of his respected tutor, faded from his memory, so powerful is success, even
in the eyes of superior men!  so strongly does force impose upon men, despite the voice of
conscience! 

When it is opened, there will be Knighthood for the Sheriffs, and
a Baronetcy was for the Politician.

  All color, all roundness of form had disappeared
from it; a livid pallor covered a skin yellow and shining like ivory; the blood seemed to have
left his veins; all the life that remained within him shone from his dark eyes, which appeared
to have grown twice as large as before, as he looked languidly around him; his long, chestnut
hair hung loosely down his neck and over a white shirt, which entirely covered him--or rather
a sort of robe with large sleeves, and of a yellowish tint, with an odor of sulphur about it;
a long, thick cord encircled his neck and fell upon his breast. Ah! he was only nice!-- I need not

Meanwhile, Cinq-Mars, gliding behind a pillar, had eagerly watched all that passed; he saw
with astonishment that the cross, in falling upon the steps, which were more exposed to the
rain than the platform, smoked and made a noise like molten lead when thrown into water.  While
the public attention was elsewhere engaged, he advanced and touched it lightly with his bare
hand, which was immediately scorched.  Seized with indignation, with all the fury of a true
heart, he took up the cross with the folds of his cloak, stepped up to Laubardemont, and, striking
him with it on the forehead, cried:

"Villain, I brand thee with the mark of this red-hot iron!"

The crowd heard these words and rushed forward.

"Arrest this madman!"  cried the unworthy magistrate.

He was himself seized by the hands of men who cried, "Justice! justice, in the name of the King!"

"We are lost!"  said Lactantius; "to the pile, to the pile!"

The Penitents dragged Urbain toward the Place, while the judges and archers reentered the church,
struggling with the furious citizens; the executioner, having no time to tie up the victim,

"He would very quietly have let this cure be burned by the other cures, and would have said
to me, 'Grandchamp, see that my horses have oats, and let no one steal them'; or, 'Grandchamp,
take care that the rain does not rust my sword or wet the priming of my pistols'; for Monsieur
le Marechal thought of everything, and never interfered in what did not concern him. That was
his great principle; and as he was, thank Heaven, alike good soldier and good general, he was
always as careful of his arms as a recruit, and would not have stood up against thirty young
