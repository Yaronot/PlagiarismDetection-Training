THANKFUL BLOSSOM

by

BRET HARTE

I

The time was the year of grace 1779; the locality, Morristown, New Jersey.

It was bitterly cold.  A northeasterly wind had been stiffening the mud of the morning's thaw
into a rigid record of that day's wayfaring on the Baskingridge road.  The hoof-prints of cavalry,
the deep ruts left by baggage-wagons, and the deeper channels worn by artillery, lay stark
and cold in the waning light of an April day.  There were icicles on the fences, a rime of
silver on the windward bark of maples, and occasional bare spots on the rocky protuberances
of the road, as if Nature had worn herself out at the knees and elbows through long waiting
for the tardy spring.  A few leaves disinterred by the thaw became crisp again, and rustled
in the wind, making the summer a thing so remote that all human hope and conjecture fled before
them.

Here and there the wayside fences and walls were broken down or dismantled; and beyond them
fields of snow downtrodden and discolored, and strewn with fragments of leather, camp equipage,
harness, and cast-off clothing, showed traces of the recent encampment and congregation of
men.  On some there were still standing the ruins of rudely constructed cabins, or the semblance
of fortification equally rude and incomplete.  A fox stealing along a half-filled ditch, a
wolf slinking behind an earthwork, typified the human abandonment and desolation.

One by one the faint sunset tints faded from the sky; the far-off crests of the Orange hills
grew darker; the nearer files of pines on the Whatnong Mountain became a mere black background;
and, with the coming-on of night, came too an icy silence that seemed to stiffen and arrest
the very wind itself.  The crisp leaves no longer rustled; the waving whips of alder and willow
snapped no longer; the icicles no longer dropped a cold fruitage from barren branch and spray;
and the roadside trees relapsed into stony quiet, so that the sound of horse's hoofs breaking
through the thin, dull, lustreless films of ice that patched the furrowed road, might have
been heard by the nearest Continental picket a mile away.

Either a knowledge of this, or the difficulties of the road, evidently irritated the viewless

"Hush!" said the father, motioning to the parlor.

"Hush," echoed Thankful indignantly.  "I won't be hushed! Everybody says 'Hush' to me.  The
count says 'Hush!'  Allan says 'Hush!'  You say 'Hush!'  I'm a-weary of this hushing.  Ah,
if there was a man who didn't say it to me!" and Mistress Thankful lifted her fine eyes to
the ceiling.

"You are unwise, Thankful,--foolish, indiscreet.  That is why you require much monition."

Thankful swung her feet in silence for a few moments, then suddenly leaped from the table,
and, seizing the old man by the lapels of his coat, fixed her eyes upon him, and said suspiciously.
"Why did you keep me from going in the company-room?  Why did you bring me in here?"

Blossom senior was staggered for a moment.  "Because, you know, the count--"

"And you were afraid the count should know I had a sweetheart? Well, I'll go in and tell him
now," she said, marching toward the door.

"Then, why did you not tell him when you slipped out an hour ago? eh, lass?" queried the old
man, grasping her hand.  "But 'tis all one, Thankful: 'twas not for him I stopped you.  There
is a young spark with him,--ay, came even as you left, lass,--a likely young gallant; and he
and the count are jabbering away in their own lingo, a kind of Italian, belike; eh, Thankful?"

"I know not," she said thoughtfully.  "Which way came the other?" In fact, a fear that this
young stranger might have witnessed the captain's embrace began to creep over her.

"From town, my lass."

Thankful turned to her father as if she had been waiting a reply to a long-asked question: "Well?"

"Were it not well to put on a few furbelows and a tucker?" queried the old man.  "'Tis a gallant
young spark; none of your country folk."

"No," said Thankful, with the promptness of a woman who was looking her best, and knew it.
And the old man, looking at her, accepted her judgment, and without another word led her to
the parlor door, and, opening it, said briefly, "My daughter, Mistress Thankful Blossom."

With the opening of the door came the sound of earnest voices that instantly ceased upon the
appearance of Mistress Thankful.  Two gentlemen lolling before the fire arose instantly, and
one came forward with an air of familiar yet respectful recognition.

"Nay, this is far too great happiness, Mistress Thankful," he said, with a strongly marked
foreign accent, and a still more strongly marked foreign manner.  "I have been in despair,
and my friend here, the Baron Pomposo, likewise."

The slightest trace of a smile, and the swiftest of reproachful glances, lit up the dark face
of the baron as he bowed low in the introduction.  Thankful dropped the courtesy of the period,--i.
e., a duck, with semicircular sweep of the right foot forward.  But the right foot was so pretty,
and the grace of the little figure so perfect, that the baron raised his eyes from the foot
to the face in serious admiration.  In the one rapid feminine glance she had given him, she
had seen that he was handsome; in the second, which she could not help from his protracted
silence, she saw that his beauty centred in his girlish, half fawn-like dark eyes.

"The baron," explained Mr. Blossom, rubbing his hands together as if through mere friction
he was trying to impart a warmth to the reception which his hard face discountenanced,--"the
baron visits us under discouragement.  He comes from far countries.  It is the custom of gentlefolk
of--of foreign extraction to wander through strange lands, commenting upon the habits and doings
of the peoples.  He will find in Jersey," continued Mr. Blossom, apparently appealing to Thankful,
yet really evading her contemptuous glance, "a hard-working yeomanry, ever ready to welcome
the stranger, and account to him, penny for penny, for all his necessary expenditure; for which
purpose, in these troublous times, he will provide for himself gold or other moneys not affected
by these local disturbances."

"He will find, good friend Blossom," said the baron in a rapid, voluble way, utterly at variance
with the soft, quiet gravity of his eyes, "Beauty, Grace, Accomplishment, and--eh--Santa Maria,
what shall I say?"  He turned appealingly to the count.

"Virtue," nodded the count.

"Truly, Birtoo! all in the fair lady of thees countries.  Ah, believe me, honest friend Blossom,
there is mooch more in thees than in thoss!"

So much of this speech was addressed to Mistress Thankful, that she had to show at least one
dimple in reply, albeit her brows were slightly knit, and she had turned upon the speaker her
honest, questioning eyes.

"And then the General Washington has been kind enough to offer his protection," added the count.

"Any fool--any one," supplemented Thankful hastily, with a slight blush--"may have the general's
pass, ay, and his good word.  But what of Mistress Prudence Bookstaver?--she that has a sweetheart
in Knyphausen's brigade, ay,--I warrant a Hessian, but of gentle blood, as Mistress Prudence
has often told me,--and, look you, all her letters stopped by the general, ay, I warrant, read
by my Lady Washington too, as if 'twere HER fault that her lad was in arms against Congress.
Riddle me that, now!"

"'Tis but prudence, lass," said Blossom, frowning on the girl. "'Tis that she might disclose
some movement of the army, tending to defeat the enemy."

"And why should she not try to save her lad from capture or ambuscade such as befell the Hessian
commissary with the provisions that you--"

Mr. Blossom, in an ostensible fatherly embrace, managed to pinch Mistress Thankful sharply.
"Hush, lass," he said with simulated playfulness; "your tongue clacks like the Whippany mill.--My
daughter has small concern--'tis the manner of womenfolk--in politics," he explained to his
guests.  "These dangersome days have given her sore affliction by way of parting comrades of
her childhood, and others whom she has much affected.  It has in some sort soured her."

Mr. Blossom would have recalled this speech as soon as it escaped him, lest it should lead
to a revelation from the truthful Mistress Thankful of her relations with the Continental captain.
But to his astonishment, and, I may add, to my own, she showed nothing of that disposition
she had exhibited a few moments before.  On the contrary, she blushed slightly, and said nothing.

And then the conversation changed,--upon the weather, the hard winter, the prospects of the
Cause, a criticism upon the commander-in-chief's management of affairs, the attitude of Congress,
etc., between Mr. Blossom and the count; characterized, I hardly need say, by that positiveness
of opinion that distinguishes the unprofessional.  In another part of the room, it so chanced
that Mistress Thankful and the baron were talking about themselves; the assembly balls; who
was the prettiest woman in Morristown; and whether Gen. Washington's attentions to Mistress
Pyne were only perfunctory gallantry, or what; and if Lady Washington's hair was really gray;
and if that young aide-de-camp, Major Van Zandt were really in love with Lady or whether his
attentions were only the zeal of a subaltern,--in the midst of which a sudden gust of wind
shook the house; and Mr. Blossom, going to the front door, came back with the announcement
that it was snowing heavily.

And indeed, within that past hour, to their astonished eyes the whole face of nature had changed.
The moon was gone, the sky hidden in a blinding, whirling swarm of stinging flakes.  The wind,
bitter and strong, had already fashioned white feathery drifts upon the threshold, over the
painted benches on the porch, and against the door-posts.

Mistress Thankful and the baron had walked to the rear door--the baron with a slight tropical
shudder--to view this meteorological change.  As Mistress Thankful looked over the snowy landscape,
it seemed to her that all record of her past experience had been effaced: her very footprints
of an hour before were lost; the gray wall on which she leaned was white and spotless now;
even the familiar farm-shed looked dim and strange and ghostly.  Had she been there? had she
seen the captain? was it all a fancy? Engineering was necessary. Malevolence may be deduce to publication.
But in humiliation of assassination, or it was necessary, ordination,

So let me add that in manner, physical equipoise, and even in the mere details of dress, this
figure indicated a certain aristocratic exclusiveness.  It was the presentment of a king,--a
king who by the irony of circumstances was just then waging war against all kingship; a ruler
of men, who just then was fighting for the right of these men to govern themselves, but whom
by his own inherent right he dominated. From the crown of his powdered head to the silver buckle
of his shoe he was so royal that it was not strange that his brother George of England and
Hanover--ruling by accident, otherwise impiously known as the "grace of God"--could find no
better way of resisting his power than by calling him "Mr. Washington."

The sound of horses' hoofs, the formal challenge of sentry, the grave questioning of the officer
of the guard, followed by footsteps upon the porch, did not apparently disturb his meditation.
Nor did the opening of the outer door, and a charge of cold air into the hall that invaded
even the privacy of the reception-room, and brightened the dying embers on the hearth, stir
his calm pre-occupation.  But an instant later there was the distinct rustle of a feminine
skirt in the hall, a hurried whispering of men's voices, and then the sudden apparition of
a smooth, fresh-faced young officer over the shoulder of the unconscious figure.

"I beg your pardon, general," said the officer doubtingly, "but--"

"You are not intruding, Col. Hamilton," said the general quietly.

"There is a young lady without who wishes an audience of your Excellency.  'Tis Mistress Thankful
Blossom,--the daughter of Abner Blossom, charged with treasonous practice and favoring the
enemy, now in the guard-house at Morristown."

"Thankful Blossom?" repeated the general interrogatively.

"Your Excellency doubtless remembers a little provincial beauty and a famous toast of the country-side,--the
Cressida of our Morristown epic, who led our gallant.  Connecticut captain astray--"

"You have the advantages, besides the better memory of a younger man, colonel," said Washington,
with a playful smile that slightly reddened the cheek of his aide-de-camp.  "Yet I think I
HAVE heard of this phenomenon.  By all means, admit her--and her escort."

"She is alone, general," responded the subordinate.

"Then the more reason why we should be polite," returned Washington, for the first time altering
his easy posture, rising to his feet, and lightly clasping his ruffled hands before him.  "We
must not keep her waiting.  Give her access, my dear colonel, at once; and even as she came,--ALONE."

The aide-de-camp bowed and withdrew.  In another moment the half-opened door swung wide to
Mistress Thankful Blossom.

She was so beautiful in her simple riding-dress, so quaint and original in that very beauty,
and, above all, so teeming with a certain vital earnestness of purpose just positive and audacious
enough to set off that beauty, that the grave gentleman before her did not content himself
with the usual formal inclination of courtesy, but actually advanced, and, taking her cold
little hand in his, graciously led her to the chair he had just vacated.

"Even if your name were not known to me, Mistress Thankful," said the commander-in-chief, looking
down upon her with grave politeness, "nature has, methinks, spared you the necessity of any
introduction to the courtesy of a gentleman.  But how can I especially serve you?"

Alack! the blaze of Mistress Thankful's brown eyes had become somewhat dimmed in the grave
half-lights of the room, in the graver, deeper dignity of the erect, soldier-like figure before
her.  The bright color born of the tempest within and without had somehow faded from her cheek;
the sauciness begotten from bullying her horse in the last half-hour's rapid ride was so subdued
by the actual presence of the man she had come to bully, that I fear she had to use all her
self-control to keep down her inclination to whimper, and to keep back the tears, that, oddly
enough, rose to her sweet eyes as she lifted them to the quietly critical yet placid glance
of her interlocutor.

"I can readily conceive the motive of this visit, Miss Thankful," continued Washington, with
a certain dignified kindliness that was more reassuring than the formal gallantry of the period;
"and it is, I protest, to your credit.  A father's welfare, however erring and weak that father
may be, is most seemly in a maiden--"

Thankful's eyes flashed again as she rose to her feet.  Her upper lip, that had a moment before
trembled in a pretty infantine distress, now stiffened and curled as she confronted the dignified
figure before her. "It is not of my father I would speak," she said saucily: "I did not ride
here alone to-night, in this weather, to talk of HIM; I warrant HE can speak for himself. 
I came here to speak of myself, of lies--ay, LIES told of me, a poor girl; ay, of cowardly
gossip about me and my sweetheart, Capt. Brewster, now confined in prison because he hath loved
me, a lass without polities or adherence to the cause--as if 'twere necessary every lad should
ask the confidence or permission of yourself or, belike, my Lady Washington, in his preferences."

She paused a moment, out of breath.  With a woman's quickness of intuition she saw the change
in Washington's face,--saw a certain cold severity overshadowing it.  With a woman's fateful
persistency--a persistency which I humbly suggest might, on occasion, be honorably copied by
our more politic sex--she went on to say what was in her, even if she were obliged, with a
woman's honorable inconsistency, to unsay it an hour or two later; an inconsistency which I
also humbly protest might be as honorably imitated by us--on occasion.

"It has been said," said Thankful Blossom quickly, "that my father has given entertainment
knowingly to two spies,--two spies that, begging your Excellency's pardon, and the pardon of
Congress, I know only as two honorable gentlemen who have as honorably tendered me their affections.
It is said, and basely and most falsely too, that my sweetheart, Capt. Allan Brewster, has
lodged this information.  I have ridden here to deny it.  I have ridden here to demand of you
that an honest woman's reputation shall not be sacrificed to the interests of politics; that
a prying mob of ragamuffins shall not be sent to an honest farmer's house to spy and spy--and
turn a poor girl out of doors that they might do it. 'Tis shameful, so it is; there! 'tis most
scandalous, so it is: there, now!  Spies, indeed! what are THEY, pray?"

In the indignation which the recollection of her wrongs had slowly gathered in her, from the
beginning of this speech, she had advanced her face, rosy with courage, and beautiful in its
impertinence, within a few inches of the dignified features and quiet gray eyes of the great
commander.  To her utter stupefaction, he bent his head and kissed her, with a grave benignity,
full on the centre of her audacious forehead.

"Be seated, I beg, Mistress Blossom," he said, taking her cold hand in his, and quietly replacing
her in the unoccupied chair.  "Be seated, I beg, and give me, if you can, your attention for
a moment.  The officer intrusted with the ungracious task of occupying your father's house
is a member of my military family, and a gentleman.  If he has so far forgotten himself--if
he has so far disgraced himself and me as--"

"No! no!" uttered Thankful, with feverish alacrity, "the gentleman was most considerate.  On
the contrary--mayhap--I"--she hesitated, and then came to a full stop, with a heightened color,
as a vivid recollection of that gentleman's face, with the mark of her riding-whip lying across
it, rose before her.

"I was about to say that Major Van Zandt, as a gentleman, has known how to fully excuse the
natural impulses of a daughter," continued Washington, with a look of perfect understanding;
"but let me now satisfy you on another point, where it would seem we greatly differ."

He walked to the door, and summoned his servant, to whom he gave an order.  In another moment
the fresh-faced young officer who had at first admitted her re-appeared with a file of official
papers.  He glanced slyly at Thankful Blossom's face with an amused look, as if he had already
heard the colloquy between her and his superior officer, and had appreciated that which neither
of the earnest actors in the scene had themselves felt,--a certain sense of humor in the situation.

Howbeit, standing before them, Col. Hamilton gravely turned over the file of papers.  Thankful
bit her lips in embarrassment.  A slight feeling of awe, and a presentiment of some fast-coming
shame; a new and strange consciousness of herself, her surroundings, of the dignity of the
two men before her; an uneasy feeling of the presence of two ladies who had in some mysterious
way entered the room from another door, and who seemed to be intently regarding her from afar
with a curiosity as if she were some strange animal; and a wild premonition that her whole
future life and happiness depended upon the events of the next few moments,--so took possession
of her, that the brave girl trembled for a moment in her isolation and loneliness.  In another
instant Col. Hamilton, speaking to his superior, but looking obviously at one of the ladies
who had entered, handed a paper to Washington, and said, "Here are the charges."

"Read them," said the general coldly.

Col. Hamilton, with a manifest consciousness of another hearer than Mistress Blossom and his
general, read the paper.  It was couched in phrases of military and legal precision, and related
briefly, that upon the certain and personal knowledge of the writer, Abner Blossom of the "Blossom
Farm" was in the habit of entertaining two gentlemen, namely, the "Count Ferdinand" and the
"Baron Pomposo," suspected enemies of the cause, and possible traitors to the Continental army.
It was signed by Allan Brewster, late captain in the Connecticut Contingent.

As Col. Hamilton exhibited the signature, Thankful Blossom had no difficulty in recognizing
the familiar bad hand and equally familiar mis-spelling of her lover.

She rose to her feet. Honor are bad. How will think the do?

"Oh! I met no one, your Excellency," said the usually truthful Thankful hastily, rushing to
her first lie with grateful impetuosity.

"And saw no one?" asked Washington quietly.

"No one," said Thankful, raising her brown eyes to the general's.

They both looked at each other,--the naturally most veracious young woman in the colonies,
and the subsequent allegorical impersonation of truth in America,--and knew each other lied,
and, I imagine, respected each other for it.

"I am glad to hear you say so, Mistress Thankful," said Washington quietly; "for 'twould have
been natural for you to have sought an interview with your recreant lover in yonder camp, though
the attempt would have been unwise and impossible."

"I had no such thought, your Excellency," said Thankful, who had really quite forgotten her
late intention; "yet, if with your permission I could hold a few moments' converse with Capt.
Brewster, it would greatly ease my mind."

"'Twould not be well for the present," said Washington thoughtfully. "But in a day or two Capt.
Brewster will be tried by court-martial at Morristown.  It shall be so ordered that when he
is conveyed thither his guard shall halt at the Blossom Farm.  I will see that the officer
in command gives you an opportunity to see him.  And I think I can promise also, Mistress Thankful,
that your father shall be also present under his own roof, a free man."

They had reached the entrance to the mansion, and entered the hall. Thankful turned impulsively,
and kissed the extended hand of the commander.  "You are so good!  I have been so foolish--so
very, very wrong," she said, with a slight trembling of her lip.  "And your Excellency believes
my story; and those gentlemen were NOT spies, but even as they gave themselves to be."

"I said not that much," replied Washington with a kindly smile, "but no matter.  Tell me rather,
Mistress Thankful, how far your acquaintance with these gentlemen has gone; or did it end with
the box on the ear that you gave the baron?"

"He had asked me to ride with him to the Baskingridge, and I--had said--yes," faltered Mistress
Thankful.

"Unless I misjudge you, Mistress Thankful, you can without great sacrifice promise me that
you will not see him until I give you my permission," said Washington, with grave playfulness.

The swinging light shone full in Thankful's truthful eyes as she lifted them to his.

"I do," she said quietly.

"Good-night," said the commander, with a formal bow.

"Good-night, your Excellency."

IV

The sun was high over the Short Hills when Mistress Thankful, the next day, drew up her sweating
mare beside the Blossom Farm gate. She had never looked prettier, she had never felt more embarrassed,
as she entered her own house.  During her rapid ride she had already framed a speech of apology
to Major Van Zandt, which, however, utterly fled from her lips as that officer showed himself
respectfully on the threshold. Yet she permitted him to usurp the functions of the grinning
Caesar, and help her from her horse; albeit she was conscious of exhibiting the awkward timidity
of a bashful rustic, until at last, with a stammering, "Thank ye," she actually ran up stairs
to hide her glowing face and far too conscious eyelids.

During the rest of that day Major Van Zandt quietly kept out of the way, without obtrusively
seeming to avoid her.  Yet, when they met casually in the performance of her household duties,
the innocent Mistress Thankful noticed, under her downcast penitential eyelids, that the eyes
of the officer followed her intently.  And thereat she fell unconsciously to imitating him;
and so they eyed each other furtively like cats, and rubbed themselves along the walls of rooms
and passages when they met, lest they should seem designedly to come near each other, and enacted
the gravest and most formal of genuflexions, courtesies, and bows, when they accidentally DID
meet.  And just at the close of the second day, as the elegant Major Van Zandt was feeling
himself fast becoming a drivelling idiot and an awkward country booby, the arrival of a courier
from headquarters saved that gentleman his self-respect forever.

Mistress Thankful was in her sitting-room when he knocked at her door. She opened it in sudden,
conscious trepidation.

"I ask pardon for intruding, Mistress Thankful Blossom," he said gravely; "but I have here"--he
held out a pretentious document--"a letter for you from headquarters.  May I hope that it contains
good news,--the release of your father.--and that it relieves you from my presence, and an
espionage which I assure you cannot be more unpleasant to you than it has been to myself."

As he entered the room, Thankful had risen to her feet with the full intention of delivering
to him her little set apology; but, as he ended his speech, she looked at him blankly, and
burst out crying.

Of course he was in an instant at her side, and holding her cold little hand.  Then she managed
to say, between her tears, that she had been wanting to make an apology to him; that she had
wanted to say ever since she arrived that she had been rude, very rude, and that she knew he
never could forgive her; that she had been trying to say that she never could forget his gentle
forbearance: "only," she added, suddenly raising her tear-fringed brown lids to the astonished
man, "YOU WOULDN'T EVER LET ME!" 

"'you told element what you call the locks,'same'it. Activity, speedily." "'you get to idle me think," you.
"Mr. Triffitt, never be'it suppose to found of nucleotide, and t

hell, in thinking-darling gave himself down to the self.



When he had gone, she threw herself in a chair, and again gave way to a passionate flood of
tears.  In the last twenty-four hours her pride had been utterly humbled: the independent spirit
of this self-willed little beauty had met for the first time with defeat. When she had got
over her womanly shock at the news of the sham baron's death, she had, I fear, only a selfish
regard at his taking off; believing that if living he would in some way show the world--which
just then consisted of the headquarters and Major Van Zandt--that he had really made love to
her, and possibly did honorably love her still, and might yet give her an opportunity to reject
him.  And now he was dead, and she was held up to the world as the conceited plaything of a
fine gentleman's masquerading sport.  That her father's cupidity and ambition made him sanction
the imposture, in her bitterness she never doubted.  No!  Lover, friend, father--all had been
false to her, and the only kindness she had received was from the men she had wantonly insulted.
Poor little Blossom! indeed, a most premature Blossom; I fear a most unthankful Blossom, sitting
there shivering in the first chill wind of adversity, rocking backward and forward, with the
skirt of her dimity short-gown over her shoulders, and her little buckled shoes and clocked
stockings pathetically crossed before her.

But healthy youth is re-active; and in an hour or two Thankful was down at the cow-shed, with
her arms around the neck of her favorite heifer, to whom she poured out much of her woes, and
from whom she won an intelligent sort of slobbering sympathy.  And then she sharply scolded
Caesar for nothing at all, and a moment after returned to the house with the air and face of
a deeply injured angel, who had been disappointed in some celestial idea of setting this world
right, but was still not above forgiveness,--a spectacle that sunk Major Van Zandt into the
dark depths of remorse, and eventually sent him to smoke a pipe of Virginia with his men in
the roadside camp; seeing which, Thankful went early to bed, and cried herself to sleep. Her are-- had

"Keep away, keep away, for Heaven's sake, Mistress Blossom," he said quickly, "or I shall plunge
you into my mishap, and make you as ridiculous as myself."

But the quick-witted girl had already leaped to an adjacent bowlder. "Take off your sash,"
she said quickly; "fasten it to your belt, and throw it to me."  He did so.  She straightened
herself back on the rock.  "Now, all together," she cried, with a preliminary strain on the
sash; and then the cords of her well-trained muscles stood out on her rounded arms, and, with
a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together, she landed the major upon the rock.
And then she laughed; and then, inconsistent as it may appear, she became grave, and at once
proceeded to scrape him off, and rub him down with dried leaves, with fern-twigs, with her
handkerchief, with the border of her mantle, as if he were a child, until he blushed with alternate
shame and secret satisfaction. 

Peggie, was unconsciously, should intrude her said nothing as they retreated out along; intently

"An escort of dragoons," said Major Van Zandt slowly, and with military precision, "has just
arrived, bringing with them one Capt. Allan Brewster, of the Connecticut Contingent, on his
way to Morristown to be tried for mutiny and treason.  A private note from Col. Hamilton instructs
me to allow him to have a private audience with you--if YOU so wish it."

With a woman's swift and too often hopeless intuition, Thankful knew that this was not the
sole contents of the letter, and that her relations with Capt. Brewster were known to the man
before her. But she drew herself up a little proudly, and, turning her truthful eyes upon the
major, said, "I DO so wish it."

"It shall be done as you desire, Mistress Blossom," returned the officer with cold politeness,
as he turned upon his heel.

"One moment, Major Van Zandt," said Thankful swiftly.

The major turned quickly; but Thankful's eyes were gazing thoughtfully forward, and scarcely
glanced at him.  "I would prefer," she said timidly and hesitatingly, "that this interview
should not take place under the roof where--where--where--my father lives.  Half-way down the
meadow there is a barn, and before it a broken part of the wall, fronting on a sycamore-tree.
HE will know where it is.  Tell him I will see him there in half an hour."

A smile, which the major had tried to make a careless one, curled his lip satirically as he
bowed in reply.  "It is the first time," he said dryly, "that I believe I have been honored
with arranging a tryst for two lovers; but believe me, Mistress Thankful, I will do my best.
In half an hour I will turn my prisoner over to you." 

About go her faltered from kneeling at Van was an male of sixty and immediate-sure fingers, and

her bosom, and flung them on the table.

She had been prepared for an outbreak or exclamation from the man before her, but not for his
cold silence. "is the Professor, Mary?" entered Professor. s'. "and that he is,

Major Van Zandt turned from the window where he had stood, and faced the girl with sad resignation.
"If I have in my foolishness, Mistress Thankful, shown you how great was your power over me,

"Of course she's gone," said Sergeant Tibbitts: "the jade flew with the captain."

"Ay, 'tis plain enough.  Two horses are gone from the stable besides the major's," said Private
Hicks.

Nor was this military criticism entirely a private one.  When the courier arrived at headquarters
the next morning, it was to bring the report that Mistress Thankful Blossom, after assisting
her lover to escape had fled with him.  "The renegade is well off our hands," said Gen. Sullivan
gruffly: "he has saved us the public disgrace of a trial. But this is bad news of Major Van Zandt."

"What news of the major?" asked Washington quickly.

"He pursued the vagabond as far as Springfield, killing his horse, and falling himself insensible
before Major Merton's quarters. Here he became speedily delirious, fever supervened, and the
regimental surgeon, after a careful examination, pronounced his case one of small-pox." 

Did we were told, however, that the criminal. Was it to be digest that, in command law, and half

be scandalized or jealous."

"the daily, man," he reply.


"Thankful!" said a voice still tremulous with weakness.

The ancient crone turned, drew aside the curtains, and showed the sweet face of Thankful Blossom,
more beautiful even in its paleness. 

"ne'er," she state.

"but, you do understand, i wear'road cognize him.'Second ne'er because

"No, dear."

"There are some things in life worth stooping for."

And she winged this Parthian arrow home with a kiss.
