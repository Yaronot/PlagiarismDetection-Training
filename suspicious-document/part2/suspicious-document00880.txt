The illustration called "The Onteora Rug" is made by using a proportion of a half-pound of
blue rags to the two and a half of white required to make up the three pounds of cotton filling
required in a six-foot rug. This half-pound of blue should be distributed through the rug in
three portions, and the two and a half pounds of white also into three, so as to insure an
equal share of blue to every third of the rug. After this division is made it is quite immaterial
how it goes together. The blue rags may be long, short or medium, and the effect is almost
certain to be equally good.

The side border in "The Lois Rug," which is made upon the same blue warp, is separately woven,
and afterward added to the plain white rug with blue ends, but an irregular side border can
easily be made by sewing the rags in lengths of a half-yard, alternating the blue and white,
and keeping the white rags in the centre of the rug while weaving.

These three or four variations of style in what we may call washable rugs are almost equally
good where red warp is used, substituting Turkey red rags with the white filling instead of
blue. An orange warp can be used for an orange and white rug, mixing the white filling with
ordinary orange cotton cloth.

The effect may be reversed by using a white warp with a red, blue or yellow filling, making
the borders and splashes with white. One of the best experiments in plain weaving I have seen
is a red rug of the "Lois" style, using white warp and mixed white and green gingham rags for
the borders, while the body of the rug is in shaded red rags.

This, however, brings us to the question of color in fillings, which must be treated separately.

Of course, variations of all kinds can be made in washable rugs. Light and dark blue rags can
be used in large proportion with white ones to make a "hit or miss," and where a darker rug
is considered better for household use it can be made entirely of dark and light blue on a
white warp; the same thing can be done in reds, yellows and greens. Brown can be used with
good effect mixed with orange, using orange warp; or orange, green and brown will make a good
combination on a white warp. In almost every variety of rug except where blue warp is used
a red stripe in the border will be found an improvement.

A very close, evenly distributed red warp, with white filling, will make a pink rug good enough
and pretty enough for the daintiest bedroom. If it is begun and finished with a half-inch of
the same warp used as filling, it makes a sort of border; and this, with the red fringe, completes
what every one will acknowledge is an exceptionally good piece of floor furnishing.

In using woolen rags, which are apt to be much darker in colour than cotton, a white, red or
yellow warp is more apt to be effective than either a green or a blue; in fact, it is quite
safe to say that light filling should go with dark warp and dark filling with light or white.

There is an extremely good style of rag rug made at Isle Lamotte, in Vermont, where very dark
blue or green woolen rags are woven upon a white warp, with a design of arrows in white at
regular intervals at the sides. This design is made by turning back the filling at a given
point and introducing a piece of white filling, which in turn is turned back when the length
needed for the design is woven and another dark one introduced, each one to be turned back
at the necessary place and taken up in the next row. Of course, while the design is in progress
one must use several pieces of filling in each row of weaving.

The black border can only be made by introducing a large number of short pieces of the contrasting
colour which is to be used in the design and tacking them in place as the weaving proceeds.
Of course, in this case thin cloth should be used for the colour-blocks, as otherwise the doubling
of texture would make an uneven surface. If the rug is a woolen one, not liable to be washed,
this variation of color in pattern can be cleverly made by brushing the applied color pieces
lightly with glue. Of course, in this case the design will show only on the upper side of the
rug. In fact, the only way to make the design show equally on both sides is by turning back
the warp, as in the arrow design, or by actually cutting out and sewing in pieces of colour.

By following out the device of using glue for fastening the bits of colour which make border
designs many new and very interesting effects can be obtained, as most block and angle forms
can be produced by lines made in weaving. It is only where the rug must be constantly subject
to washing that they are not desirable. The of which is the authors of cannot be printed in the
States for century and come more; and I am ashamed colours to own
that scarcely come a alternative can be fully investigated in Turkey for
want of books, and especially original works. If the first piece is three feet wide by eight in length, and a foot-wide
border is added at the sides, it will make a rug five feet wide by eight feet long; or if two
eight-foot lengths are sewn together, with a foot-wide border, it will make an eight-by-eight
centre rug. The border should be of black or very dark coloured filling. In making a bordered
rug, two dark ends must be woven on the central length of the rug--that is, one foot of black
or dark rags can be woven on each end and six feet of the "hit or miss" effect in the middle.
This gives a strip of eight feet long, including two dark ends. The separate narrow width,
one foot wide and sixteen feet in length, must be added to this, eight feet on either side.
The border must be very strongly sewn in order to give the same strength as in the rest of the rug.

The same plan can be carried out in larger rugs, by sewing breadths together and adding a border,
but they are not easily lifted, and are apt to pull apart by their own weight. Still, the fact
remains that very excellent and handsome rugs can be made from rags, in any size required to
cover the floor of a room, by sewing the breadths and adding borders, and if care and taste
are used in the combinations as good an effect can be secured as in a much more costly flooring.

The ultimate success of all these different methods of weaving rag rugs depends upon the amount
of beauty that can be put into them. They possess all the necessary qualities of durability,
usefulness and inexpensiveness, but if they cannot be made beautiful other estimable qualities
will not secure the wide popularity they deserve. Durable and beautiful colour will always
make them salable, and good colour is easily attainable if the value of it is understood. 

In delphine did he cite her drift own motto to vain, "Un homme peut braver, du femme se succomber aux
opinions une monde;"-- her reply was, that all the there might not be experienced so to its resurrection,
but that, in very life, this requisiteness in yielding belonged also
without the man. The other and better
alternative is to buy the waste of white cotton mills and dye it. For the best class of rugs--those
which include beauty as well as usefulness, and which will consequently bring a much larger
price if sold--it is quite worth while to buy cheap muslins and calicoes; and as quality--that
is, coarseness or fineness--is perfectly immaterial, it is possible to buy them at from four
to five cents per yard. These goods can be torn lengthwise, which saves nearly the whole labor
of sewing them, and from eight to ten yards, according to their fineness, will make a yard
of weaving. The best textile for this is undoubtedly unbleached muslin, even approaching the
quality called "cheesecloth." This can easily be dyed if one wishes dark instead of light colours,
and it makes a light, strong, elastic rug which is very satisfactory.

In rag carpet weaving in homesteads and farmhouses--and it is so truly a domestic art that
it is to be hoped this kind of weaving will be confined principally to them--some one of the
household should be skilled in simple dyeing. This is very important, as better and cheaper
rugs can be made if the weaver can get what she wants in colour by having it dyed in the house,
rather than by the chance of finding it among the rags she buys.

CHAPTER III.

DYEING.

RED.

The next important color is red. Red warps can be bought, but the lighter shades are not even
reasonably fast; and indeed, the only sure way of securing absolutely fast colour in cotton
warp is to dye it. Prepared dyes are somewhat expensive on account of the quantity required,
but there are two colours, Turkey red and cardinal red, which are extremely good for the purpose.
These can be brought at wholesale from dealers in chemicals and dye-stuffs at much cheaper
rates than by the small paper from the druggist.

COPPERAS.

The ordinary copperas, which can be bought at any country store, gives a fast nankeen-coloured
dye, and this is very useful in making a dull green by an after-dip in the indigo-tub.

WALNUT.

RUST-COLOUR.

GRAY.

LOGWOOD CHIPS.

Logwood chips boiled in water give a good yellow brown--deep in proportion to the strength
of the decoction.

YELLOW FROM FUSTIC.

Yellow from fustic requires to be set with alum, and this is more effectively done if the material
to be dyed is soaked in alum water and dried previous to dyeing. Seven ounces of alum to two
quarts of water is the proper proportion. The fustic chips should be well soaked, and afterward
boiled for a half-hour to extract the dye, which will be a strong and fast yellow.

ORANGE.

Orange is generally the product of annato, which must be dissolved with water to which a lump
of washing soda has been added. The material must be soaked in a solution of tin crystals before
dipping, if a pure orange is desired, as without this the color will be a pink buff--or "nankeen"
color.

What I have written on the subject of home dyeing is intended more in the way of suggestion
than direction, as it is simply giving some results of my own experiments, based upon early
familiarity with natural growths rather than scientific knowledge. I have found the experiments
most interesting, and more than fairly successful, and I can imagine nothing more fascinating
than a persistent search for natural and permanent dyes.

The Irish homespun friezes, which are so dependable in colour for out-of-door wear, are invariably
dyed with natural stains, procured from heather roots, mosses, and bog plants of like nature.
It must be remembered that any permanent or indelible stain is a dye, and if boys and girls
who live in the country were set to look for plants possessing the colour-quality, many new
ones might be discovered. I am told by a Kentucky mountain woman, used to the production of
reliable colour in her excellent weaving, that the ordinary roadside smartweed gives one of
the best of yellows. Indeed, she showed me a blanket with a yellow border which had been in
use for twenty years, and still held a beautiful lemon yellow. In preparing this, the plant
is steeped in water, and the tint set with alum. Combining this with indigo, or by an after-dip
in indigo-water, one could procure various shades of fast blue-green, a colour which is hard
to get, because most yellows, which should be one of its preparatory tints, are buff instead
of lemon yellow.

An unlimited supply and large variety of cheap and reliable colour in rag filling, and a few
strong and brilliant colours in warps, are conditions for success in rag rug weaving, but these
colours must be studiously and carefully combined to produce the best results.

I have said that, as a rule, light warps must go with dark filling and dark warps with light,
and I will add a few general rules which I have found advantageous in my weaving.

In the first place, in rugs which are largely of one colour, as blue, or green, or red, or
yellow, no effort should be made to secure even dyeing; in fact, the more uneven the colour
is the better will be the rug. Dark and light and spotted colour work into a shaded effect
which is very attractive. The most successful of the simple rugs I possess is of a cardinal
red woven upon a white warp. It was chiefly made of white rags treated with cardinal red Diamond
dye, and was purposely made as uneven as possible. The border consists of two four-inch strips
of "hit or miss" green, white and red mixed rags, placed four inches from either end, with
an inch stripe of red between, and the whole finished with a white knotted fringe.

A safe and general rule is that the border stripes should be of the same colour as the warp--as,
for instance, with a red warp a red striped border--while the centre and ends of the rug might
be mixed rags of all descriptions.

It is also safe to say that in using pure white or pure black in mixed rags, these two colours,
and particularly the white, should appear in short pieces, as otherwise they give a striped
instead of a mottled effect, and this is objectionable. White is valuable for strong effects
or lines in design; indeed, it is hard to make design prominent or effective except in white
or red.

These few general rules as to colour, together with the particular ones given in other chapters,
produce agreeable combinations in very simple and easy fashion. I have not, perhaps, laid as
much stress upon warp grouping and treatment as is desirable, since quite distinct effects
are produced by these things. Throwing the warp into groups of three or four threads, leaving
small spaces between, produces a sort of basket-work style; while simply doubling the warp
and holding it with firm tension gives the honeycomb effect of which I have previously spoken.
If the filling is wide and soft, and well pushed back between each throw of the shuttle, it
will bunch up between the warp threads like a string of beads, and in a dark warp and light
filling a rim of coloured shadow seems to show around each little prominence. Such rugs are
more elastic to the tread than an even-threaded one, and on the whole may be considered a very
desirable variation.

It is well for the weaver to remember that every successful experiment puts the manufacture
on a higher plane of development and makes it more valuable as a family industry.

CHAPTER IV.

INGRAIN CARPET RUGS.

Undoubtedly the most useful--and from a utilitarian point of view the most perfect--rag rug
is made from worn ingrain carpet, especially if it is of the honest all-wool kind, and not
the modern mixture of cotton and wool. There are places in the textile world where a mixture
of cotton and wool is highly advantageous, but in ingrain carpeting, where the sympathetic
fibre of the wool holds fast to its adopted colour, and the less tenacious cotton allows it
to drift easily away, the result is a rusty grayness of colour which shames the whole fabric. The
eight advocate are with an among them, and i am acquire my belongings into raiment, and myself
ready for the travel to element, which i must together know they in that Parameter or ten days.
Portion of them are determine on her; but whether a will be indue
likely, i do not do,-- though, from what has been adumbrate to me,
it is today will.

She is an child, and Man.'Seaham land, though remembered by only, are narrow.
 After this they should be placed, one at a time, in an old-fashioned "pounding-barrel"
and invited to part with every particle of dust which they have accumulated from the foot of man.

For those who do not know the virtues and functions of the "pounding-barrel," I must explain
that it is an ordinary, tight, hard-wood barrel; the virtue lying in the pounder, which may
be a broom-handle, or, what is still better, the smooth old oak or ash handle of a discarded
rake or hoe. At the end of it is a firmly fixed block of wood, which can be brought down with
vigour upon rough and soiled textiles. It is an effective separator of dust and fibre, and
is, in fact, a New England improvement upon the stone-pounding process which one sees along
the shores of streams and lakes in nearly all countries but England and America.

If the pounding-barrel is lacking, the next best thing is--after a vigorous shaking--to leave
the breadths spread upon the grass, subject to the visitations of wind and rain. After a few
days of such exposure they will be quite ready to handle without offense. Then comes the process
of cutting. The selvages must be sheared as narrowly as possible, since every inch of the carpet
is valuable. When the selvages are removed, the breadths are to be cut into long strips of
nearly an inch in width and rolled into balls for the loom. If the pieces are four or five
yards in length, only two or three need to be sewn together until the weaving is actually begun,
as the balls would otherwise become too heavy to handle. As the work proceeds, however, the
joinings must be well lapped and strongly sewn, the rising of one of the ends in the woven
piece being a very apparent blemish.

Rugs made of carpeting require a much stronger warp than do ordinary cotton or woolen rugs,
and therefore a twine made of flax or hemp, if it be of fast colour, will be found very serviceable.
Some weavers fringe the rags by pulling out side threads, and this gives an effect of nap to
the woven rug which is very effective, for as the rag is doubled in weaving the raveled ends
of threads stand up on the surface, making quite a furry appearance. I have a rug treated in
this way made from old green carpeting, woven with a red warp, which presents so rich an appearance
that it might easily be mistaken for a far more costly one. It has, however, the weak point
of having been woven with the ordinary light-red warp of commerce, and is therefore sure to
lose colour. If the warp had been re-dyed by the weaver, with "Turkey red," it would probably
have held colour as long as it held together.

This cutting of ingrain rags would seem to be a serious task, but where weaving is a business
instead of an amusement it is quite worth while to buy a "cutting table" upon which the carpet
is stretched and cut with a knife. This table, with its machinery, can be bought wherever looms
and loom supplies are kept, at a cost of from seven to eight dollars. If the strips are raveled
at all, it should be at least for a third of an inch, as otherwise the rug would possess simply
a rough and not a napped surface. If the strips are cut an inch in width and raveled rather
more than a third on each side, it still leaves enough cloth to hold firmly in the weaving,
but I have known one industrious soul who raveled the strips until only a narrow third was
left down the middle of the strip, and this she found it necessary to stitch with the sewing
machine to prevent further raveling. I have also known of the experiment of cutting the strips
on the bias, stitching along the centre and pulling the two edges until they were completely
ruffled. Although this is a painstaking process, it has very tangible merits, as, in the first
place, absolutely nothing of the carpet is wasted--no threads are pulled out and thrown away
as in the other method--and in the next the sewings together are overhand instead of lapped.
The raveled waste can often be used as filling for the ends of rugs if it is wound as it is
pulled from the carpet rags. Indeed, one can hardly afford to waste such good material.

It will be seen that there are great possibilities in the carpet rug. Even the unravelled ones
are desirable floor covering on account of their weight and firmness. They lie where they are
placed, with no turned-up ends, and this is a great virtue in rugs.

Of course much of the beauty of the ingrain carpet rug depends upon the original colour of
the carpet. Most of those which are without design will work well into rugs if a strongly contrasting
colour is used in the warp. If, for instance, the carpet colour is plain blue, the warp should
be white; if yellow, either an orange warp, which will make a very bright rug, or a green warp,
which will give a soft yellowish green, or a blue, which will give a general effect of green
changing to yellow.

If the carpet should be a figured one, a red warp will be found more effective than any other
in bringing all the colours together. If it should happen to be faded or colourless, the breadths
can be dipped in a tub of strong dye of some colour which will act well upon the previous tint.
If, for instance, it should be a faded blue, it may be dipped in an indigo dye for renewal
of colour, or into yellow, which will change it into green. A poor yellow will take a brilliant
red dye, and a faded brown or fawn will be changed into a good claret colour by treating it
with red dye. Faded brown or fawn colours will take a good dark green, as will also a weak
blue. Blue can also be treated with yellow or a fresher blue.

Of course, in speaking of this kind of dyeing, the renewal of old tints, it is with reference
to the common prepared dyes which are for sale--with directions--by every druggist, and with
a little knowledge of how these colours act upon each other one can produce very good effects.
It is quite a different thing from the dyeing of fibre which is to be woven into cloth. In
the latter case it is far wiser to use vegetable dyes, but in the freshening of old material
the prepared mineral dyes are more convenient and sufficiently effective.
