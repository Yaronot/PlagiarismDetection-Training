NELSON, HORATIO, LORD, great English admiral, born at Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk; entered the
navy as a midshipman in 1770, and after voyages to the West Indies, the Arctic regions, and
the East Indies, was promoted to a lieutenancy in 1777; three years later he headed the expedition
against San Juan, was invalided home, and in 1781 acted under Lord Hood in American waters;
in command of the Boreas on the Leeward Islands station, here he involved himself in trouble
through his severe and arbitrary enforcement of the Navigation Act against American traders,
and there also he met and married in 1787 the widow of Dr. Nesbit; returning home he lived
for five years in retirement, but on the eve of the French Revolutionary war he was again summoned
to active service, and in command of the Agamemnon, advanced his reputation by gallant conduct
in the Mediterranean operations of Lord Hood, losing his right eye during the storming of Calvi,
in Corsica; conspicuous bravery at the engagement with the Spaniards off Cape St. Vincent (1797)
brought him promotion to the rank of rear-admiral; in the same year he lost his right arm at
Santa Cruz, and in the following year, with an inferior force, annihilated the French fleet
in the Bay of Aboukir, for which he was raised to the peerage as Baron Nelson, and created
Duke of Bronte by the King of Naples; at this time began his lifelong liaison with LADY HAMILTON
(q. v.); involving himself in Neapolitan affairs, he went beyond his commission in suppressing
the rebel Jacobins, and especially in executing their leader Caracciolo; in 1800 he returned
home, his never robust strength considerably impaired; as vice-admiral nominally under Sir
Hugh Parker, he in 1801 sailed for the Baltic and inflicted a signal defeat on the Danish fleet
off Copenhagen; for this he was made Viscount and commander-in-chief; during the scare of a
Napoleonic invasion he kept a vigilant watch in the Channel, and on the resumption of war he
on October 21, 1805, crowned his great career by a memorable victory off Trafalgar over the
French fleet commanded by Villeneuve, but was himself mortally wounded at the very height of
