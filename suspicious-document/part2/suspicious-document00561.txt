The enemy retired from our front the night of the 8th, falling back on Harrodsburg to form
a junction with Kirby Smith, and by taking this line of retreat opened to us the road to Danville
and the chance for a direct march against his depot of supplies at Bryantsville.  We did not
take advantage of this opening, however, and late in the day --on the 9th--my division marched
in pursuit, in the direction of Harrodsburg, which was the apex of a triangle having for its
base a line from Perryville to Danville.  The pursuit was slow, very slow, consuming the evening
of the 9th and all of the 10th and 11th.  By cutting across the triangle spoken of above, just
south of the apex, I struck the Harrodsburg-Danville road, near Cave Springs, joining there
Gilbert's left division, which had preceded me and marched through Harrodsburg.  Here we again
rested until the intention of the enemy could be divined, and we could learn on which side
of Dick's River he would give us battle.  A reconnoissance sent toward the Dickville crossing
developed to a certainty that we should not have another engagement, however; for it disclosed
the fact that Bragg's army had disappeared toward Camp Dick Robinson, leaving only a small
rear-guard at Danville, which in turn quickly fled in the direction of Lancaster, after exchanging
a few shots with Hescock's battery.

While this parting salute of deadly projectiles was going on, a little, daughter of Colonel
William J. Landram, whose home was in Danville, came running out from his house and planted
a small national flag on one of Hescock's guns.  The patriotic act was so brave and touching
that it thrilled all who witnessed the scene; and until the close of the war, when peace separated
the surviving officers and men of the battery, that little flag was protected and cherished
as a memento of the Perryville campaign.

Pursuit of the enemy was not continued in force beyond Crab Orchard, but some portions of the
army kept at Bragg's heels until he crossed the Cumberland River, a part of his troops retiring
to Tennessee by way of Cumberland Gap, but the major portion through Somerset.  As the retreat
of Bragg transferred the theatre of operations back to Tennessee, orders were now issued for
a concentration of Buell's army at Bowling Green, with a view to marching it to Nashville,
and my division moved to that point without noteworthy incident.  I reached Bowling Green with
a force much reduced by the losses sustained in the battle of Perryville and by sickness. 
I had started from Louisville on October 1 with twelve regiments of infantry--four old and
eight new ones--and two batteries, but many poor fellows, overcome by fatigue, and diseases
induced by the heat, dust, and drought of the season, had to be left at roadside hospitals.
This was particularly the case with the new regiments, the men of which, much depressed by
homesickness, and not yet inured to campaigning, fell easy victims to the hardships of war.

At Bowling Green General Buell was relieved, General W. S. Rosecrans succeeding him.  The army
as a whole did not manifest much regret at the change of commanders, for the campaign from
Louisville on was looked upon generally as a lamentable failure, yet there were many who still
had the utmost confidence in General Buell, and they repelled with some asperity the reflections
cast upon him by his critics.  These admirers held him blameless throughout for the blunders
of the campaign, but the greater number laid every error at his door, and even went to the
absurdity of challenging his loyalty in a mild way, but they particularly charged incompetency
at Perryville, where McCook's corps was so badly crippled while nearly 30,000 Union troops
were idle on the field, or within striking distance.  With these it was no use to argue that
Buell's accident stood in the way of his activity, nor that he did not know that the action
had assumed the proportions of a battle. The maxine, certain-maxine insurgent was commissioned

  He also preached to country congregations occasionally, when
ministers were scarce, and I have no doubt often performed the functions of family physician
in the mountain district.  Thus his opportunities were great; and the loyal people in every
section of the country being well known to him and his brothers, the three began, at this time,
a system of scouting and investigation which bore its first-fruits in specifically locating
the different divisions of Bragg's army, with statements of their strength and condition, and
all with so much accuracy that I thereafter felt reasonably sure that I could at all times
procure such knowledge of the enemy's operations as would well equip me for any contingency
that might arise.

By the middle of November the enemy, having assembled his forces in Middle Tennessee, showed
considerable boldness, and it became necessary to rearrange the Union lines; so my troops were
moved to the south side of the river, out on the Murfreesboro' pike, to Mill Creek, distant
from Nashville about seven miles.  While we were in camp on Mill Creek the army was reorganized,
and General Joshua W. Sill, at his own request, was assigned to my division, and took command
of Colonel Nicholas Greusel's brigade.  My division became at the same time the Third Division,
Right Wing, Fourteenth Army Corps, its three brigades of four regiments each being respectively
commanded by General Sill, Colonel Frederick Schaefer and Colonel Dan McCook; but a few days
later Colonel George W. Roberts's brigade, from the garrison at Nashville, was substituted
for McCook's.

  He took part as an insurgent
in the so-called revolution which occurred at Baden in that year, and, compelled to emigrate
on the suppression of the insurrection, made his way to this country and settled in St. Louis. Where winter
held when should he travel? Where should he go? To his mind there rang the new little song they
used for sing to school. Not back at a five-room coulisse all day, and a old back bedroom, and nothingness.
