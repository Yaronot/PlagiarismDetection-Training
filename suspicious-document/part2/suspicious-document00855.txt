"Don't speak so loud, Tristy," replied the woman, "but take the pack to the boat, and I will
follow you."

"That surely is not your child?" said Mrs. Sackville, as the boy walked off with the bundle
singing, at the top of his voice, a very vulgar song, and affecting to reel like a drunken man.

"No, thank God," said the woman, "he is a poor heaven-forsaken lad, who is going into Canada.
He has helped me along from Buffalo, and has offered to carry my bundle to Chippewa."

It occurred to Mrs. Sackville to caution the woman to be on her guard, for she thought Tristy
looked wicked enough for any mischief; but a signal from the boat obliged them all to hasten
to the shore. Biddy good naturedly took the eldest boy by the hand and led him to the boat,
and then took leave of all her new friends, pouring forth a shower of prayers that God would
bless them all, rich and poor.

The woman, whom we shall henceforth call by her name, Mrs. Barton, was reserved in the expression
of her feelings; but the tear of gratitude she dropped on Biddy's hand at parting, was an equivalent
for the girl's voluble expressions.

There was, in all the poor woman's manner, an unobtrusiveness and reserve uncommon in a person
of her humble degree, and it interested Mrs. Sackville more than any solicitation could have
done. She ascertained that Mrs. Barton was on her way to Quebec, where she hoped to find her
husband.

"And have you the means of getting there?" asked Mrs. Sackville. "It is a great distance, my
friend, and you cannot get across Ontario and down the St. Lawrence for a trifle."

"I know that, madam; but I have some money; and if I find my own country people as kind to
me as the people in the States have been, I shall do very well. Every body feels pitiful to
a lone woman with little children. If it please God to mend my little girl, I shall go on with
good courage."

Mrs. Sackville commended the poor woman's resolution, and busied herself putting up some medicines
for the child, and giving directions about them, and was so occupied with her benevolent duty,
that she gave little heed to Edward's continued exclamations. "Oh, mother! how beautiful the
colour of the water of the Niagara is!" "Mother, does not it give you sublime feelings to think
you are on the Niagara?" "Mother, does not Lake Erie look grand from here?" &c. &c. &c. Suddenly
his attention was diverted, and he was attracted to the extremity of the boat, where Tristy,
the little "Flibbertigibbet" we have before mentioned, was exhibiting various feats for the
amusement of the passengers. He was a little, pale, wizened-face fellow, with a bleared and
blood-shot eye, his hair black, strait, and matted to his head, his mouth defiled with tobacco,
and in short his whole appearance indicating the depravity of one experienced in vice. He dislocated
the joints of his fingers, stood firmly on his head, and performed some of the difficult exploits
of a tumbler; and when he had done all this, "Come, gentlemen," said he, "shall I sing you
a song, or pray you a prayer? I'll suit your fancy with either for a sixpence."

"No, no; none of your prayers, you little son of the old one," said one of the men; "we shall
have your master with the cloven foot after us before we get to the shore: you may sing us
a song, though, only let it be a decent one."

"Oh, well gentlemen, suit yourselves--I am a Jack at all trades, you know--that is to say,
at any of the trades my father, that is dead and gone, followed before me."

"Trades! your father followed no trade, but the trade of the light-fingered gentry."

"I beg your pardon, sir; my dad was a noted man in his day:--a carpenter, joiner, tooth-drawer,
barber, gardener, studying-master, dancing-master, whipping-master, fiddling-master, school-master,
music-master, play-actor, &c. &c.--all of which I am yours gentlemen to command. Now for the
song:--there is Erie, and my song is Perry's glorious victory." He then half sung, half recited,
a ballad recounting Perry's gallant exploits on the lake.

It was impossible for a compassionate being to see the little outcast without an emotion of
pity; or not to be affected by the weak and almost infantine tones of his voice.

"How old are you, child?" asked Mr. Sackville, as the boy concluded his song, and opened his
mouth to catch the sixpence that was tossed to him.

"How old? I do not justly remember; but there is my age set down in our family Bible, as my
father called it, by his own honored hand, on the day he got through, as I have heard him say,
his fourth term of service at the state-castle."

Mr. Sackville took from the child's hand a filthy little dream-book, on the title-page of which
was scrawled, and scarcely legible,--"Tristram McPhelan, born in the Bridewell, city of New-York,
on Friday--bad luck to him--March 1807."

"You are then but eleven years old."

"Yes sir; and in that time I have seen more of life than many of my betters twice my age. I
have been in every state in the Union, and in every city of every state. I have been in six
alms-houses, two workhouses, and ten jails, on my own account, besides the privilege of visiting
my father in two different state prisons. While my father lived we travelled in company, and
now I am obliged (he concluded, bowing to Mr. Sackville,) to put up with what company chance
throws in my way."

Mr. Sackville took Edward by the hand, and turned away, grieved and disgusted. His eye fell
on his daughter, who was sitting beside Mrs. Barton, carefully sheltering the sick child from
the sun with her parasol, while she nicely prepared an orange and offered it to her. The little
sufferer seized it eagerly and devoured it, and then fixed her eyes on Julia and smiled. The
first smile of a sick child is electrifying. 

Stress to pieceworker humiliation, the son, s batch'gratuity! More wing stir her bedstead,

"Well then, mother, just listen to one more proposal:--take the woman into the carriage, and
let Edward and me walk two or three miles. Three miles will be quite a lift to her, and Ned
will lead the little boy."

Mrs. Sackville could not resist Julia's eagerness, and after some consultation with her husband
and brother, she consented to the arrangement, though it involved them in some inconvenience
and delay. It was as much a matter of principle as feeling with her, never to permit her own
personal accommodation to interfere with the claims of humanity. A child is more impressed
with a single example of disinterestedness, than with a hundred admonitions on the subject.
Mrs. Sackville had some difficulty in overcoming the scruples of Mrs. Barton, who felt a modest
awkwardness at seating herself in the carriage with her superiors; but when they reached the
Canada shore, the necessary arrangements were made, and she being at last persuaded, on the
ground of gratifying the children, took their place in the carriage, and it drove off and left
Edward and Julia to follow with little Richard Barton, and Tristram with the wallet.

Mr. Morris was one of those thrifty people, who can never see any necessity of poverty, and
though he was in the main kind hearted, he was rather inclined to be severe in his judgment
of the wretched. Poverty was always suspicious in his eyes. No sooner were they seated and
well under way, than he said, "It is a mystery to me, my good woman, why people who have not
any spare cash should always be travelling. Sometimes they are going up country to see a relation--and
sometimes down country. All their kindred are sure to live at their antipodes."

Mrs. Barton kept her eyes downcast on her child, and made no reply. "Now," continued Mr. Morris,
"what use or pleasure there can be in lugging children from Dan to Beersheba, is more than
I can imagine."

"God knows, I do not travel for the pleasure of it," meekly replied the poor woman.

"Oh, no, no--I dare say not--I dare say not"--said Mr. Morris, who had whiffed away his pet
with the first breath. "You are of another sort. But, pray, my friend, what are you travelling
for?"

"To join my husband at Quebec."

"Your husband at Quebec--and you here! how the deuce came that about?"

"My child has fallen asleep," replied Mrs. Barton, turning to Mrs. Sackville; "and if you,
ma'am, will condescend to hear the cause of my being here--there is no reason that I should
be loath to tell it; only you know, ma'am, one does not like to be forward about speaking of
troubles to strangers--and those so kind as you, it seems like begging, which I am not forward
to do."

Mrs. Sackville assured Mrs. Barton, that she felt great interest in knowing how she came into
her present circumstances.

"My husband," she said, "was a corporal in the fortieth ----. We were in Spain through all
Wellington's campaigns, and had just crossed the Pyrennees into France, and were thinking of
going home to England again, when the regiment was ordered to America. This was no great disappointment
to me--I have no known relation in the world but my husband and child--then I had but the one.
My husband is a sober man, who fears God and serves his king with all his heart: and his pay
with my earnings, (for I did up all the linen of our officers) furnished us a decent living.
When we arrived at Quebec, our regiment was sent into Upper Canada.
