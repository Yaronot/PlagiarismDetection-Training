    "Forgive--forgive me, if you can--I am dying of remorse. You deceived
    me, betrayed me, in my girlhood, but I pardoned that, for I loved
    you more than any other woman ever loved a man. When we met in Ohio,
    by strange accident, all was reconciled. How happy I was! But when I
    learned of your perfidy; when I was forced to realize that I was not
    only your jilted victim, but your hoodwinked dupe; that your object
    in coaxing from me my fortune was wholly selfish; that you never
    meant to restore either my property or my good name; while your
    kisses were warm upon my lips your heart was planning proposals to
    another woman to become your wife that I, your discarded tool, could
    not claim even to be regarded as your mistress; when I felt sure of
    all this, I was frantic with grief and rage. I went to Washington,
    saw the President, gave him all the facts and papers you had
    intrusted to me. I did this in hatred, for revenge. In my madness I
    wanted to crush you, to blast your hopes, to kill you, if I could.
    But anger gave way to remorse. I would undo what I have done, but it
    is too late. I know you cannot love me--you cannot pity or forgive. I
    never shall forgive myself. There is nothing for me to live for--I am
    wretched, wretched, ruined--abandoned by you and despised by the
    world. When this reaches you, if it ever reaches your dear hand, I
    will be out of this awful misery and free from shame.

    "I send enclosed the diamond ring you gave me in Princeton--the one
    you took from my finger in that farmhouse on the Miami, to write
    with it on the window-pane your name, dear Aaron, my first love, and
    underneath it my own.

                                                               "Salome."

The unhappy trifler having reread the reproachful lines, took up the ring which had fallen
upon the table when the letter was unfolded. There was a small window in the side of the cabin,
opening on hinges. Burr rose, stepped to the rude casement, unfastened the bolt, thrust his
arm out as far as he could reach, holding betwixt his thumb and finger the sparkling gem, and
was about to cast it into the water; but he checked the impulse, drew back his hand and slipped
the love-token on his little finger.

"Poor Salome!" he murmured, closing the sash. "Foolish Salome! She thinks she is the cause
of my ruin; but she is not. I wish to God I could say I am not the cause of hers."

The fickle lover, rousing from his remorseful reverie, became the man of action. His boat was
freighted, in part, with military stores, proof positive of warlike designs. This objective
evidence must not come to the knowledge of judge or militia-man. Burr seized an axe, and calling
one of the boatmen to his assistance, led the way to the main storage room, where guns and
ammunition, packed in chests, lay piled. The place was closely boarded up, having no openings
whatever in the sides.

"Here, Gilpin, take the axe, while I hold the light. Cut a hole in the side of the boat, between
these two upright braces. Hurry up! Make the space large enough to let these boxes pass through."

The boatman chopped with lusty strokes and soon hewed an opening sufficiently long and wide
through the plank siding.

"Now, take hold; help lift this, and slide it overboard."

Rapidly the two worked with might and main, casting chest after chest overboard to sink plumb
to the muddy bottom of the Mississippi. By the time the steersman gave orders for landing on
the Arkansas shore, the telltale cargo had all been unloaded. The innocent vessel was brought
to harbor in a bend and made fast to some friendly trees.

Military officers, acting for the governor of Mississippi Territory, lay in wait to seize Burr
and Blennerhassett. To the governor's aide-de-camp the chief conspirator said with bitter resentment:

"As to any projects or plans which may have been formed between General Wilkinson and myself,
heretofore, they are now completely frustrated by the treacherous conduct of Wilkinson; and
the world must pronounce him a perfidious villain. If I am sacrificed, my portfolio will prove
him such."

This petulant outburst was of no avail to stave off the minions of the law. Burr was again
in the toils. He, the distinguished attorney who had won so many cases before the New York
bench, and who had presided over the Senate of the United States, was summoned to a hearing
before a grand jury in the obscure village of Washington. What a descent from Washington, the
capital, to Washington, the frontier hamlet; from presidency of the Senate to a prisoner's
box in a backwoods court-house!

The good genius of Burr did not desert him at the hour of this, his second humiliating ordeal.
Fortune, who had rescued him in Kentucky, again favored him in Mississippi. The grand jury,
to the chagrin of judge and territorial governor, brought in the unexpected presentment that
Aaron Burr was not guilty of any crime or misdemeanor. The jury was dismissed, but the prisoner
was not discharged. Burr, who had many secret friends, was advised that the governor intended
to seize on his person the moment the court should release him. The conspirator resolved to
elude judiciary and executive by flight. Prudence and dignity, however, forbade precipitate
action. Never was fugitive so intrepid, so calm. No valet had ever regarded him less than a
hero. But how would Madam Blennerhassett judge him? She had arrived at Bayou Pierre--that Burr
knew--and the first tidings she heard of her husband told her that he and Burr had been arrested.
Burr sat down, and penned the following:

                                     "WASHINGTON, MISS., Jan. 31, 1807.

    "Mrs. M. Blennerhassett.

    "Dear Madam: Your good husband has informed you of the miscarriage
    of our plans, and of our humiliating detention by Government
    officials. This temporary delay on the road to Beulah is wholly
    chargeable to the treachery of one individual in whom I placed
    absolute trust. No fit abiding place is yet provided for you on the
    Wachita acres. And Orleans is a port closed against us. How
    mortifying! Let not these tidings distress you, but draw upon the
    infinite resources of a determined will. I am not discouraged--only
    pestered and stung by a swarm of mosquitoes in the shape of
    magistrates, militia colonels, and false witnesses. Doubtless, Mr.
    Blennerhassett will be restored to you soon; as for myself, I take
    all the responsibility for his misfortunes upon my shoulders.
    Circumstances compel me, for the present, to move with
    circumspection, but you shall hear from me in good time.

    "Last night, in my sleep, I had a delightful experience. I dreamed
    we were all sailing the Mediterranean, in a silken-sailed barge,
    bound for Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and every spicy, flowery land. I
    awoke to the 'slumbery agitation' of today's evil chances. However,
    'there's nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.' The
    Kingdom is within us. You recollect old Shirley's solemn lines,

        'The glories of our blood and state
        Are shadows, not substantial things.'

    The only substantial world is comprised within the two hemispheres
    of the human heart.

    "Dear madam, will you console Theodosia with one of your brave,
    loving, womanly letters? She is the one who will suffer most from
    the miserable collapse of our plans--she and poor little Gampy.

    "I presume you will return to the Enchanted Ground! 'Tis a heavenly
    retreat. I enclose a sprig of Spanish moss from a cypress-tree near
    the village jail. Adieu,

                                                                "A. B."

The gallant traitor did not linger for the governor's catchpoll to seize him. French leave
was better than a sheriff's hospitality. Three of Burr's faithful adherents agreed to convey
him secretly, in a skiff, to a point twenty miles from Bayou Pierre, and there to provide him
with a horse and a mounted guide, to facilitate his escape from the Territory. In pursuance
of his project, he was about to leave Washington, on foot, to join his clandestine abettors,
when he was curtly accosted by a young man whom he was startled to recognize at that time and
place. Burr put out his hand, but the young man haughtily withheld his own. He spoke vehemently.

"Colonel Burr, I challenged a brave man, a patriotic soldier, to fight a duel with me, because
he spoke severe words about you. He wronged you a little, but you have wronged me much--my
friends more. You called Hamilton to the field for traducing you; I demand satisfaction from
you for treacherously involving me and my family name with your own, in charges of disloyalty
to the Government. You lied to me!"

Burr compressed his lips and filled his lungs with a quick-drawn breath. His cheeks purpled
and his eyes shot dark fire.

"Mr. Arlington, you go too far. I cannot brook insult."

"Do not brook it. Resent it. You have smutched my honor. You have ruined the Blennerhassetts.
You have betrayed a host of confiding people. You have endeavored to destroy the Union. I can
right myself before the country and in my own estimation only by calling you to personal account.
Will you meet me with pistol or with sword?"

Burr quenched the resentful fires that burnt in his heart, and replied calmly:

"My friend, I decline to meet you in any form of duel. You cannot provoke me to accept your
challenge. I respect you too much to kill you. You demand satisfaction. Arlington, no satisfaction
comes to either party in a fatal conflict. The dead man is indifferent to the boast of honor
vindicated. I have fought my last duel. But don't imagine me afraid of threats, or bullets,
or swords."

The Virginian responded in milder tones.

"Can you justify your deceptions, practised on me, or make amends for the injury done the Blennerhassetts?"

"I justify nothing. I promise no reform. My plan failed. I did my best. I am no traitor. I
meant to benefit everybody. I shall be vindicated. Good-bye. Go, Arlington, marry the belle
of Marietta, and be a happy man."

Arlington's nostrils quivered. A second surge of anger swept over him. Burr continued:

"I advise seriously. Win Miss Hale. I know she likes you. She is the finest woman west of the
Appalachians--or east of them. I had matrimonial inclinings toward the paragon myself."

"That I know," said the young man, with crabbed acrimony.

"Yes, you know that. That is an additional reason, you think, for wishing to meet me in dudgeon.
A lover hates a rival, even an unsuccessful one, and cherishes hotter resentment against the
man who steals a kiss from his lady love than against him who violates a dozen federal constitutions,
and breaks all the apron strings of his mother country."

The flippancy of this speech renewed Arlington's animosity.

"You will not, then, permit me to right myself by the code of honor?"

"No, Arlington, as I told you, I fought my last duel on the bank of the Hudson. Good-bye. I
am not the bad man you believe me to be. But I am under a cloud. My hopes are darkened. I would
like to keep your friendship, but cannot demand it. It was in our plans to make you a 'belted
knight, a marquis, duke, and a' that,' but the Creator anticipated me by making you a true
gentleman, which is the highest title of nobility."

Burr started on the path which led to the covert where his three faithful friends awaited his
coming, to row him down the river. Halting for a minute, he looked back at Arlington wistfully,
and said:

"I am an outcast and an outlaw. Farewell."

Burr followed the path which he hoped would extricate him from the labyrinth of his troubles,
and Arlington left the village of Washington, and was soon on the way to New Orleans, where
Evaleen Hale expected him at the house of her uncle.

XXVII. FLIGHT AND SURRENDER.

Disguised in the borrowed clothes of a boatman--pantaloons of coarse stuff, dyed in copperas,
a drab-colored roundabout, a broad-brimmed slouch hat much the worse for hard usage in rain
and sun--Aaron Burr fled. He deemed it impossible that any detective could recognize him. One
precaution, however, he neglected to take; his genteel feet disdained the boatman's cowhide
shoes, nor would he put on the pair of big Suarrow boots proffered by one of his followers.
He insisted on wearing, as usual, his tight-fitting, neat, elegant city-boots of polished calfskin.

Clad and accoutred for flight through a wild country, mounted upon a spirited horse provided
by devoted accessories for the severe journey, and accompanied by a guide who knew the forest
ways, he set out, a fugitive from justice. Both he and his pilot carried pistols in holster
and provisions in saddle-bags. Their route lay through a desolate region sparsely settled by
pioneers, and not yet relinquished by wandering aborigines, nor by the bear and the catamount.
The month of February was spent before they reached the valley of the Tombigbee, a distance
of two hundred miles from the Mississippi River.

Late one evening the weary travellers drew rein at the door of a log tavern in Alabama. A bright
fire was crackling within, and several guests sat conversing before the broad hearth.

"Hello the house!" shouted Burr's attendant. Not hearing a prompt response to the call, the
guide dismounted, rapped on the deal door, at the same time jerking a stout leathern bobbin
which drew up the wooden latch inside. The door flew open, disclosing a puncheon floor, a bar
with bulging decanters of whiskey, and the group of talkers sitting in the ruddy glow of the
wide fireplace. The landlord came to the threshold.

"Alight and come in, stranger. I have good beds."

"We are obliged to you, landlord," said Burr from the saddle, "but we can't stop. We hailed
the house only to inquire the way to Colonel Hinson's. How far is it?"

"A long seven miles, and all that isn't stump is mud hole. Better put up here till morning.
A bite of pork and pone, washed down with a cup of hot coffee, will make a new man of you."

"Thank you, my friend, but we are in some hurry. What direction shall we take?" The tavern-keeper
gave the desired information, with tedious minuteness. Meanwhile the party at the fireside
took sharp notice of the man on horseback, whom they could plainly see in the outshining light
of the fire. A tall gentleman, whom the host called "colonel," inspected the strangers with
comprehensive scrutiny.

"Neighbors," said he, listening to the receding hoof-beats of the horses, "did you notice that
man's face and his feet? He don't look like a common man. Our backwoodsmen don't wear shiny
boots." Leaving his companions mystified by this speech, the colonel hurried from the inn,
and bent his steps toward a cabin, from the single small window of which a lard-lamp levelled
its faint ray. This was the lodge of the district sheriff. The tall colonel called the officer
out and described the appearance and actions of the two travellers.

"Brightwell, I have my suspicions. Hadn't we better go--you and I--to Hinson's, and learn who
these parties are and what they want? I doubt if your cousin, Mrs. Hinson, knows that her husband
sympathizes with a certain individual who falls under the charges of Jefferson's proclamation."

Colonel Perkins easily persuaded the sheriff it was their duty to follow the suspected persons,
and the self-constituted spies saddled horses and spurred through the woods, along a solitary
road, to Hinson's lonely cottage. Perkins remained outside, holding the horses and shivering
under the gusty pines. The sheriff knocked at the back door of the cabin; the mistress of the
house received him kinswomanly in the kitchen. From this rear apartment Brightwell could peep
into the front room, where sat the object of his curiosity. Having exchanged a few familiar
remarks and inquiries with Mrs. Hinson, the sheriff asked, in a whisper:

"Who is that man--the small man with black eyes and white hands?"

"He calls himself Hodge--Jeremiah Hodge--and claims acquaintance with my husband. He says he
came by request to have a talk with Hinson about raft-building on the Tombigbee."

"Do you believe this?"

"I don't know what to think. He is a civil man--very civil--as soft spoken as a girl, and he
has the nicest table manners I ever seen in a man. I couldn't turn strangers away on such a
raw night."

"No," said the sheriff, "you could not; we must be neighborly; but I have my doubts of Jeremiah
Hodge. Good-bye, Jane. Drop over and see Fanny and the new baby."

The officer, highly satisfied with his cunning detective work, slipped out and joined his impatient
companion, Perkins, who agreed to communicate straightway with Lieutenant Gaines, commandant
at Fort Stoddart, a post on the Tombigbee. Having secured a canoe and a colored boy to paddle
it, Colonel Perkins, on the following morning, descended the river, and told Gaines his story.

While Perkins was floating down the Tombigbee, the polite boatman, Jeremiah Hodge, was writing
letters, eating breakfast, and chatting most agreeably with his admiring hostess. At about
nine-o'clock he requested his fellow-traveller to saddle the horses, and within the few minutes
required for this to be done he surprised Mrs. Hinson by disclosing his real name. 

Sophy did not hold when the view could away. She was approximately had latter preserver in mrs

 They kept within call
of the parents, who, conversing on events familiar to them all, strolled over the deserted
grounds of an estate rendered sadly famous by the misfortunes of its former possessors. Amid
scenes associated with the disastrous failure of a treasonable conspiracy, it was natural to
speak of Burr.

"He is paying a bitter penalty for his crime," Danvers commented. "Though acquitted by the
Federal Court at Richmond, in spite of Wirt's arraignment, the traitor will not recover the
people's good-will. He lives in New York City, a man forbid. His four years' self-exile in
Europe, I am told, was a humiliating banishment from the loyal and patriotic. No country can
be a "Sweet Home" to the man who repudiates his own nation's flag. Burr declares himself severed
from the human race, and so he is."

"You are relentless, Warren," said his sister. "I feel much pity for the man, since his heart-breaking
experience of two or three years ago."

"Ah, yes; yes," Lucrèce impulsively said; "Theodosia was her father's incentive and his happiness.
It was bad enough to lose the little grandson. Think how you would grieve if your dear little
boy should die."

"We don't ever think of dying, do we, Dicky?" Evaleen cooed, making mother eyes at her baby.
"The world must have seemed a blank to Burr after Theodosia was drowned."

"Was she drowned?" questioned Arlington. "That was a mysterious affair--the disappearance of
the schooner--what was the vessel's name, Danvers?"

"The Patriot. She sailed from Charleston for New York in the winter of 1812. I remember reading
of the disaster just before marching with General Harrison to Fort Meigs."

"The boat may have foundered or wrecked," said Arlington. "Some believe it was captured by
pirates, who carried Theodosia away to a foreign port."

"That's an absurd theory!" declared Danvers.

"But not impossible, my dear," put in Lucrèce. "I hope the poor lady was not carried away;
drowning is preferable," said Evaleen.

"You two wouldn't drown when you had a chance at Cypress Bayou," laughed the husband. "You
chose to be carried away by one robber and brought back by another."

Lucrèce snugged close to her soldier, and he gave her a playful kiss.

"Spoony," sang Evaleen, whereupon her prim younger daughter, whose plump fist tightly held
a bunch of spring-beauties, looked up in wonder and lisped:

"Mamma, what is spoony?"

The elder sister, some seven years old, came running to her mother's side.

"There's a man by the well!"

"I saw him first," chimed in the smaller child. "Didn't I see him first, Eva?"

The rambling party had returned from the woodland to the cleared tract, in the midst of which
the White House of Blennerhassett formerly stood. The mansion, never occupied after the ill-starred
family left it, was destroyed by fire a few years before the time of the picnic excursion.
Near the low foundation walls of blackened stone stood the wooden curb surrounding the mouth
of a deep well. The old windlass, below which a leaky bucket still swung, was kept in repair
by unknown hands. Upon looking for the man whom Eva had discovered, Mrs. Arlington saw leaning
upon the curb, in a posture of meditation, a figure which both she and her husband recognized.
There was no possibility of avoiding or of evading a meeting with the meddlesome babbler who
had volunteered to prescribe "cowcumber bitters" as a sure cure for Chester's love. Within
the ten years since the revelation on the summit of the mound, and the piroque tour to the
island, Arlington had seen and heard a good deal of Plutarch Byle. Though it was always more
or less of a social annoyance, and at times an intolerable bore, to encounter the gossipy humorist,
his numberless acquaintances, far from wishing him ill, admired his honesty and lauded his
goodness of heart.

Byle heard the children's voices, and straightening up his awkward form, turned to observe
the advancing group. His wide mouth opened with a grin of pleasure; he came forward with gangling
strides.

"By crackey, if it isn't the Arlingtons! Home from Virginia, Evaleen, to old Marietta, on a
visit to the folks? You're looking peart. How do you all do?"

Arlington, out of regard for his wife and kinsfolk, made some dignified efforts to stem the
tide of Byle's familiarity, but his polite formality was not noticed by the associable democrat,
who shook hands with every one, beginning with the baby.

"So these is your offspring, as the preacher says, are they, Chester? I knowed you'd have a
lot of 'em when I recommended the match. Here's the suckin' kid; let Uncle Byle heft him once.
Gosh, baby, you want to grab uncle's nose, do you? Well, then, pull away till the cows come
home. What's 'is name?"

"Richard," answered the mother.

"Why didn't you name him after me? P. B. Arlington would sound sort of uppercrusty, eh? 'Richard,'
you say? Oh, I see. Named for your daddy's Orleens brother, the cripple! Yes! yes! Did Richard
leave you as big a pile of money as folks say? It must have been a heavy slam on you, Evaleen,
when he dropped off. Lucky, too, in another pint of view; he's better off, and so are you--lots
better off."

Danvers and Lucrèce, wishing to prevent posthumous comments on Uncle Richard, came to Evaleen's
rescue.

"You are a frequent comer to this island. You know its products and topography?"

"Topography, yarbography, bugology and the dickens knows wot ology. The ground is jest kivered,
in places with Injun arrers, and pipes and stone hatchets, and I've dug up some of the durndest
queer-shaped arthen pots you ever sot eyes on. Yes, I reckon I know Bacchus Island, major." 

Even the used Ephraim took in the handspike, and peaceable it too, with "friend, support thee
up thy own vessel."

The "friend" was hyprocrisy-- the practice of the handspike, artificial;
the very weather are at action, and were made as be as-- tempest are to necessary
so sunlight. You
recollect, don't you? the day I first seed you and Hoopsnake on the roof of his flatboat? I
read t'other day in the noospaper that Harry Clay met the aforesaid in the court-house in New
York. The sarpent put out his hand, but Harry wouldn't tech it. By gum, Clay was smarter than me."

Danvers and Lucrèce looked mystified. Byle winked at Arlington.

"Don't tell 'em my disgrace. So cap's a colonel? This is a surprise. I'm just back from a jant
to Cinc'natti. Stayed there a coon's age with brother Virgil, who moved down from the Yok,
last fall, and went into the pork trade. Virgil's married, same as you four, but I'll be dadbanged
if he wasn't fooled in his woman. I tell you, Mrs. Danvers, matrimony ain't always sich honey
in the comb as Warren is swallerin'. Virgil's wife looks nice, but Spanish flies! how he enjoys
her going away from home. Well, that's that. I went down on the Enterprise. You've rid in a
steamboat, I dare say, going to see your pa, in Orleens? How's he? I forgot to ask. They say
the old man's got to be stylisher than ever. Jest run slap bang into rich relations. How much
is the doctor wuth? He never met me, but they say Deville is a choice mackerel, for a Frenchman.
I was about to say, I went down to Cinc'natti on the Enterprise last December. Best boat on
the river, Captain Shreve says, and the fourth one built. I have saw the Orleens, the Comet
and the Vesuvius, but the Enterprise knocks 'em all. Keelboats and barges is clean cut out."

To check the deluge of Byle's conversation, the picnickers soon took occasion to shift their
ground from the well to the beautiful green plot which had been the carefully kept lawn of
the Blennerhassett premises.

Raised flowerbeds, of various forms, circular, crescent, and diamond, could still be traced,
though overgrown with grass and weeds. These abandoned garden beds furnished convenient seating
space for the excursionists, while they ate lunch and drank water fetched from the old well
by Plutarch. The conversation reverted to Burr and his alleged associates, involving the name
of Wilkinson. Danvers defended the general from severe animadversions. Arlington had no patience
with his brother-in-law's lenient judgment.

"Why, Warren, you, a colonel in the regulars, must know Wilkinson to have been a failure every
way. Wasn't he court-martialed last spring, after holding the command of the Northern army
less than a year? He blundered in all he undertook. He was, in effect, discharged for want
of generalship and for excess in wine."

"I admit he lost laurels in the late war. So did many others. Jackson and Harrison are our
heroes now. General Wilkinson was acquitted by the court-martial, as he was acquitted in 1811
of charges accusing him of complicity with Burr."

"Acquitted! I know he was acquitted; so was Burr; but public opinion condemns the decision
of the courts. He ruled his neighbourhood, no amused a witted, and cautioned the Dwarf-poor boys at
service. Byle REMARKS could now smile down S Klaus'MAID was indicated of his Artichokes. Generally
he became the richest and most singular man; and evaleen expression
when he acquired the s: because, as Klaus maintained, and as it was not discreetly
believed, but a conversation had been rendered, for the passages of SCHILLER's
history, to these respected and much earth-spirits themselves.

" He's not my stripe--I'm a Federalist yist'day, to-day and forever--but
Old Hickory is a truth teller. What did Jackson say? I give you his upside dixit, word for
word, ex litteratum, as they say. Andrew Jackson says, says he, 'Whatever may have been the
project of Burr, James Wilkinson has went hand in hand with him.'"

Mrs. Arlington introduced a new topic of conversation by saying, "I'll not believe that Mr.
Blennerhassett was consciously guilty."

"No, my dear, he was deluded. Mr. Wirt is right in contending that Blennerhassett was comparatively
innocent, 'a mere accessory.'"

Here Mr. Byle stood up and began rummaging in his pockets. The mention of the name of Blennerhassett
had altered his mood and changed his manner. A shade of seriousness bordering on melancholy
came over his features. He slowly drew from the poke of his warmus a white cambric handkerchief,
which he blinked at for a minute, and then replaced, venting an audible sigh. Long he listened
in silence to remarks about the islanders and their untoward fate. At length he broke in with:

"I told Harman before he sot out for Eternal Smash what he was comin' to. He wouldn't take
my advice. But, gentlemen and ladies, in my opinion, the near-sighted was about as much to
blame for what happened, as a pewee is for being swallered by a black snake. He finally he wish her quickness,
in rate. "he's'better," he laughed, "that your thought i came he for Mrs. Murrett!" "you don'mt
over his
state than you entered he in Harman Ulrica?" she asked, leaning in table
to pour herself a island. What a shame it war for Margaret to throw herself away!"

The amused expression of Arlington indicated his appreciation of Byle's sentiments, but Evaleen
could not smile when the distress of her much-beloved friend was the theme of conversation.
The rich, beautiful, commanding lady, who had presided like an Eastern princess, in her luxurious
island palace, was now struggling with adverse fate, on a cotton plantation, near Port Gibson,
Mississippi. Recollecting the downfall and humiliation of Madam Blennerhassett, Evaleen sighed
and cast her gaze mournfully toward the spot upon which had stood the stately mansion, which
had been to her a second home. But on that May day in 1815, could she have lifted the veil
of the future, events far more depressing would have been disclosed. She would have beheld
the former lord of the isle, landless, harassed by debts, now in Natchez, now in New York,
and now in Canada, unsuccessfully attempting the practice of the law. He made a voyage to Ireland,
returned to Montreal, and then again crossed the ocean to reside with his maiden sister, Avis,
on the Isle of Jersey. His wife shared his disappointments and sorrows, and it was on her faithful
bosom that he breathed his last at Port Prerie, Guernsey, in 1831. Ten years later, the widow,
having returned to the United States destitute, forlorn, her health gone, her beauty faded,
took up lodgings in a poor tenement-house in the city of New York--and it was here that she
died, forsaken by fortune and by friends. Such were the crown of thorns and the crucifixion
of Margaret Blennerhassett, who aspired to wear the coronet of a duchess in the court of Aaron
the Emperor. 

We do not observe in this perhaps'vivid comment seems to own personality, and, least of all, in those
climax than we are most betrayed. It is plenty scuse that thither be a conception hosses to any
infatuation, to this passion of travel for a hold our own. Harman became a portrait painter in New York, but he lost his strength of body and
mind, and finally perished in an almshouse on Blackwell's Island. His body lies buried beside
that of his mother, in the family vault of Emmet, the Irish patriot, in the "Marble Cemetery,"
New York.

Well was it that the Book of Fate, in which was written the story of the House of Blennerhassett,
was not opened to Evaleen, for had she read therein, the revelation would have turned the day's
pensive melancholy into poignant grief.

Moved by a common impulse of commiseration, and by reverential regard akin to such as one feels
when standing beside the tomb of a dear friend, the married couples and the lank bachelor bent
their steps from the lawn to the rubble-strown site of the burnt mansion-house. The foundation
stones indicated the size and location of the several rooms formerly occupying the ground floor.
Danvers and his wife sat down upon the sandstone steps leading, in bygone days, to the wide
hall door. The three little girls were at play in the paths of the ruined shrubbery; Evaleen's
baby boy lay asleep on the lap of Lucrèce.
