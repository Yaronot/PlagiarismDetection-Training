Messages and telegrams were also received from the Yeshivah Me'ah Shearim, Mr. D. Slutskin,
from the scholars of the Yeshivah "Or Zoraiah" of Jaffa and many synagogues. Also from Mr.
Friedenberg of Jerusalem, Mr. S. Tolkovsky, Dr. Eliash, from the Chief Rabbi of Alexandria,
from the "Old Aged" Home in Jaffe, from the Mizrachi, from Rabbi S.L. Shapiro of Jerusalem,
etc., etc.

At the request of the host, who is a British subject, a special prayer was offered up for the
Divine protection of King George the Fifth, and also prayers in the name of R. Barnett for
the health of the High Commissioner, the Secretary, the leaders of the Zionist Movement--Weitzman,
Sokolov and Usishkin, for the Chief Rabbis of Palestine and for the Rabbi Sonnenfeld, Rabbis
Diskin, Epstein, etc., etc.

Mr. Barnett offered a certain sum in the name of each, and among the numerous institutions
to which he contributed were the following: Hebrew Archaeological Society at Jerusalem, the
building of a synagogue on the site of the Old Temple Wall, the school for the blind, the poor
of Jaffe, the Home for Aged Jews, etc., etc.

Mr. Barnett was then enrolled in the Golden Book by those present. Great indeed was the honour
which R. Zorach Barnett and his wife received on that day, but they were really worthy of it.

May theirs be an example to others!
