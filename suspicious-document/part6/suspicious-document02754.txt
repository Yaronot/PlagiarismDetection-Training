People used to say of me that I was too individualistic.  I must be far more of an individualist
than ever I was.  I must get far more out of myself than ever I got, and ask far less of the
world than ever I asked. Indeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but
from too little.  The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time contemptible action of
my life was to allow myself to appeal to society for help and protection.  To have made such
an appeal would have been from the individualist point of view bad enough, but what excuse
can there ever be put forward for having made it?  Of course once I had put into motion the
forces of society, society turned on me and said, 'Have you been living all this time in defiance
of my laws, and do you now appeal to those laws for protection?  You shall have those laws
exercised to the full.  You shall abide by what you have appealed to.'  The result is I am
in gaol.  Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such ignoble instruments, as I did.

The Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art. Charming people, such
as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and the like, know nothing about art, and are
the very salt of the earth.  He is the Philistine who upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous,
blind, mechanical forces of society, and who does not recognise dynamic force when he meets
it either in a man or a movement.

People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil things of life, and
to have found pleasure in their company.  But then, from the point of view through which I,
as an artist in life, approach them they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating.  The
danger was half the excitement. . . . My business as an artist was with Ariel.  I set myself
to wrestle with Caliban. . . .

A great friend of mine--a friend of ten years' standing--came to see me some time ago, and
told me that he did not believe a single word of what was said against me, and wished me to
know that he considered me quite innocent, and the victim of a hideous plot.  I burst into
tears at what he said, and told him that while there was much amongst the definite charges
that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice, still that my life had been
full of perverse pleasures, and that unless he accepted that as a fact about me and realised
it to the full I could not possibly be friends with him any more, or ever be in his company.
It was a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I have not got his friendship on false
pretences.

Emotional forces, as I say somewhere in Intentions, are as limited in extent and duration as
the forces of physical energy.  The little cup that is made to hold so much can hold so much
and no more, though all the purple vats of Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the
treaders stand knee-deep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain. There is no
error more common than that of thinking that those who are the causes or occasions of great
tragedies share in the feelings suitable to the tragic mood: no error more fatal than expecting
it of them.  The martyr in his 'shirt of flame' may be looking on the face of God, but to him
who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than
the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in
the forest, or the fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe.  Great
passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by those who are on a
level with them.

I know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view of art, nothing more
suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than Shakespeare's drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
They are Hamlet's college friends.  They have been his companions.  They bring with them memories
of pleasant days together.  At the moment when they come across him in the play he is staggering
under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament.  The dead have come armed
out of the grave to impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him.  He is
a dreamer, and he is called upon to act.  He has the nature of the poet, and he is asked to
grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect, with life in its practical realisation,
of which he knows nothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so much. He
has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly. Brutus used madness as a
cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the dagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is
a mere mask for the hiding of weakness.  In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance
of delay.  He keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory.  He makes himself
the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own words knows them to be but 'words,
words, words.'  Instead of trying to be the hero of his own history, he seeks to be the spectator
of his own tragedy. Dorothea'Liter. Dix is not know a spectacle Worcester, S. Her father who was

everything.

  They are what modern life has contributed to the antique ideal of friendship. 
He who writes a new De Amicitia must find a niche for them, and praise them in Tusculan prose.
They are types fixed for all time.  To censure them would show 'a lack of appreciation.'  They
are merely out of their sphere: that is all.  In sublimity of soul there is no contagion. 
High thoughts and high emotions are by their very existence isolated.

I am to be released, if all goes well with me, towards the end of May, and hope to go at once
to some little sea-side village abroad with R--- and M---.

The sea, as Euripides says in one of his plays about Iphigeneia, washes away the stains and
wounds of the world.

I hope to be at least a month with my friends, and to gain peace and balance, and a less troubled
heart, and a sweeter mood.  I have a strange longing for the great simple primeval things,
such as the sea, to me no less of a mother than the Earth.  It seems to me that we all look
at Nature too much, and live with her too little.  I discern great sanity in the Greek attitude.
They never chattered about sunsets, or discussed whether the shadows on the grass were really
mauve or not.  But they saw that the sea was for the swimmer, and the sand for the feet of
the runner.  They loved the trees for the shadow that they cast, and the forest for its silence
at noon.  The vineyard-dresser wreathed his hair with ivy that he might keep off the rays of
the sun as he stooped over the young shoots, and for the artist and the athlete, the two types
that Greece gave us, they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter laurel and of the
wild parsley, which else had been of no service to men.
