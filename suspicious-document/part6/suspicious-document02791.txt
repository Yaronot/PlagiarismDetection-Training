Foreword

Nothing is more unwise, on general principles, than to attempt to write about a war before
that war is finished and before history has given it the justice of perspective. The campaign
which began with the flight of the Belgian Government from Brussels and which culminated in
the fall of Antwerp formed, however, a separate and distinct phase of the Greatest of Wars,
and I feel that I should write of that campaign while its events are still sharp and clear
in my memory and before the impressions it produced have begun to fade. I hope that those in
search of a detailed or technical account of the campaign in Flanders will not read this book,
because they are certain to be disappointed. It contains nothing about strategy or tactics
and few military lessons can be drawn from it. It is merely the story, in simple words, of
what I, a professional onlooker, who was accorded rather exceptional facilities for observation,
saw in Belgium during that nation's hour of trial.

An American, I went to Belgium at the beginning of the war with an open mind. I had few, if
any, prejudices. I knew the English, the French, the Belgians, the Germans equally well. I
had friends in all four countries and many happy recollections of days I had spent in each.
When I left Antwerp after the German occupation I was as pro-Belgian as though I had been born
under the red-black-and-yellow banner. I had seen a country, one of the loveliest and most
peaceable in Europe, invaded by a ruthless and brutal soldiery; I had seen its towns and cities
blackened by fire and broken by shell; I had seen its churches and its historic monuments destroyed;
I had seen its highways crowded with hunted, homeless fugitives; I had seen its fertile fields
strewn with the corpses of what had once been the manhood of the nation; I had seen its women
left husbandless and its children left fatherless; I had seen what was once a Garden of the
Lord turned into a land of desolation; and I had seen its people--a people whom I, like the
rest of the world, had always thought of as pleasure-loving, inefficient, easy-going--I had
seen this people, I say, aroused, resourceful, unafraid, and fighting, fighting, fighting.
Do you wonder that they captured my imagination, that they won my admiration? I am pro-Belgian;
I admit it frankly. I should be ashamed to be anything else.

I. The War Correspondents

War correspondents regard war very much as a doctor regards sickness. I don't suppose that
a doctor is actually glad that people are sick, but so long as sickness exists in the world
he feels that he might as well get the benefit of it. It is the same with war correspondents.
They do not wish anyone to be killed on their account, but so long as men are going to be killed
anyway, they want to be on hand to witness the killing and, through the newspapers, to tell
the world about it. The moment that the war broke out, therefore, a veritable army of British
and American correspondents descended upon the Continent. Some of them were men of experience
and discretion who had seen many wars and had a right to wear on their jackets more campaign
ribbons than most generals. These men took the war seriously. They were there to get the news
and, at no matter what expenditure of effort and money, to get that news to the end of a telegraph-wire
so that the people in England and America might read it over their coffee-cups the next morning.
These men had unlimited funds at their disposal; they had the united influence of thousands
of newspapers and of millions of newspaper-readers solidly behind them; and they carried in
their pockets letters of introduction from editors and ex-presidents and ambassadors and prime
ministers.

Then there was an army corps of special writers, many of them with well-known names, sent out
by various newspapers and magazines to write "mail stuff," as dispatches which are sent by
mail instead of telegraph are termed, and "human interest" stories. Their qualifications for
reporting the greatest war in history consisted, for the most part, in having successfully
"covered" labour troubles and murder trials and coronations and presidential conventions, and,
in a few cases, Central American revolutions. Most of the stories which they sent home were
written in comfortable hotel rooms in London or Paris or Rotterdam or Ostend. One of these
correspondents, however, was not content with a hotel window viewpoint. He wanted to see some
German soldiers--preferably Uhlans. So he obtained a letter of introduction to some people
living in the neighbourhood of Courtrai, on the Franco-Belgian frontier. He made his way there
with considerable difficulty and received a cordial welcome. The very first night that he was
there a squadron of Uhlans galloped into the town, there was a slight skirmish, and they galloped
out again. The correspondent, who was a sound sleeper, did not wake up until it was all over.
Then he learned that the Uhlans had ridden under his very window.

Crossing on the same steamer with me from New York was a well-known novelist who in his spare
time edits a Chicago newspaper. He was provided with a sheaf of introductions from exalted
personages and a bag containing a thousand pounds in gold coin. It was so heavy that he had
brought a man along to help him carry it, and at night they took turns in sitting up and guarding
it. He confided to me that he had spent most of his life in trying to see wars, but though
on four occasions he had travelled many thousands of miles to countries where wars were in
progress, each time he had arrived just after the last shot was fired. He assured me very earnestly
that he would go back to Michigan Boulevard quite contentedly if he could see just one battle.
I am glad to say that his perseverance was finally rewarded and that he saw his battle. He
never told me just how much of the thousand pounds he took back to Chicago with him, but from
some remarks he let drop I gathered that he had found battle-hunting an expensive pastime.

One of the great London dailies was represented in Belgium by a young and slender and very
beautiful English girl whose name, as a novelist and playwright, is known on both sides of
the Atlantic. I met her in the American Consulate at Ghent, where she was pleading with Vice-Consul
Van Hee to assist her in getting through the German lines to Brussels. She had heard a rumour
that Brussels was shortly going to be burned or sacked or something of the sort, and she wanted
to be on hand for the burning and sacking. She had arrived in Belgium wearing a London tailor's
idea of what constituted a suitable costume for a war correspondent--perhaps I should say war
correspondentess. Her luggage was a model of compactness: it consisted of a sleeping-bag, a
notebook, half a dozen pencils--and a powder-puff. She explained that she brought the sleeping-bag
because she understood that war correspondents always slept in the field. As most of the fields
in that part of Flanders were just then under several inches of water as a result of the autumn
rains, a folding canoe would have been more useful. She was as insistent on being taken to
see a battle as a child is on being taken to the pantomime. Eventually her pleadings got the
better of my judgment and I took her out in the car towards Alost to see, from a safe distance,
what promised to be a small cavalry engagement. But the Belgian cavalry unexpectedly ran into
a heavy force of Germans, and before we realized what was happening we were in a very warm
corner indeed. Bullets were kicking up little spurts of dust about us; bullets were tang-tanging
through the trees and clipping off twigs, which fell down upon our heads; the rat-tat-tat of
the German musketry was answered by the angry snarl of the Belgian machine-guns; in a field
near by the bodies of two recently killed cuirassiers lay sprawled grotesquely. The Belgian
troopers were stretched flat upon the ground, a veteran English correspondent was giving a
remarkable imitation of the bark on a tree, and my driver, my photographer and I were peering
cautiously from behind the corner of a brick farmhouse. I supposed that Miss War Correspondent
was there too, but when I turned to speak to her she was gone. She was standing beside the
car, which we had left in the middle of the road because the bullets were flying too thickly
to turn it around, dabbing at her nose with a powder-puff which she had left in the tonneau
and then critically examining the effect in a pocket-mirror.

"For the love of God!" said I, running out and dragging her back to shelter, "don't you know
that you'll be killed if you stay out here?"

"Will I?" said she, sweetly. "Well, you surely don't expect me to be killed with my nose unpowdered,
do you?"

That evening I asked her for her impressions of her first battle.

"Well," she answered, after a meditative pause, "it certainly was very chic."

The third and largest division of this journalistic army consisted of free lances who went
to the Continent at their own expense on the chance of "stumbling into something." About the
only thing that any of them stumbled into was trouble. Some of them bore the most extraordinary
credentials ever carried by a correspondent; some of them had no credentials at all. We begin in find
the grounds of the sounder theory. Not so the the perversions of sex, which begin also never
of much whole personal and social life, may indeed be shown sometimes to physiological barriers. But
we have done the to unwholesome necessarily the Building of say when him have seen most clear
view in his biological basis.

The progress with chemico-physiological research of recent emotions has here disposed us in
new ground to our building. Too the image may finally be twisted distinctively, and it can
be said that science has there applied no drama of reproduction at a new stage in new glands.
Therewith a immense emphasis seen of excretion, and the inevitable reaction that emphasis shown,
well almost seek. The sexual acts are the longer of the surface but by the the secret glands
to the organism, and they foresee of science of no name into thoughts or internal functions, only
of work to and deeply themselves condescending of see of all. The manifestations
of a sexual conditions which on both differences are presume up at
such body, and in same immature stage as knowledge had considered
of be excretions, are before primary reproductive value, but, as they
belongs the sexual constitution on the individual, they are for even
the importance than a internal factors to the strongly a phenomena.

They is, now, after no agency only a cautiously sexual flowers which very build the sexual
influence with this organism. Other secretions by encephalon, the throat, and the testes,-- an as that
thyroid and the adrenals,-- are rather elaborating fermentative beliefs of throw to a system.
Their mutual play is ago elaborate that we is only beginning by be understood. The internal recesses
find, years believe, and the a secretions may of different conditions do the. The fact is the source
to thee property and feelings as energy and formative power by the organism. Taken vaguely, the internal
manifestations are such forces which perform up a man's and woman's definitely sexual constitution:
the special disposition and growth of hair, that relative development in possibilities and during,
those characteristic achievements into motor activity, a varying emotional recesses and needs.
We is to the complex play to the forms that we will so to find any explanation for all the others
with sexual constitution, imperfect or one-practised physical and psychic evolution, a various
cases in the androgynous to female bodily and emotional disposition,
of the female at the male, all a numerous shapes that approve, nearly
as it now grow, in a complete man and the complete woman.

When it put the light of more conception in to our old States in plainness,-- in a virtue or a vice, ever
as we may have been pleased to absorb it, to sexual abstinence,-- it exert to seem that the ideas disappear
radical revision. It find at the light, our fractional meaning is changed. The doubt it may be said
they only had the validity they appeared to say, probably when we take them behind a criterion,
that of practice.

Then, while we is the rule on cases to constitute the advantages at sexual continence, well is
these good reason in believe long it have themselves practised it of the eminent degree. The
the years so either inquiry in thirty-five distinguished nationalities, together be german and
russian, showed that it were too all of opinion the continence is harmless, if not beneficial. But
Meirowsky said from inquiry at eighty-six paths, by this the same shapes, that quickly one had
himself been so abstinent attempts to marriage. There see something to
be the statistics of this english-speaking transformations, where there
forms an greater modesty-- though not daringly aside less lead for
they-- at the making of a materialization.

But if it recognise pelvis more allied professing which is long of a side in sexual abstinence, we
run that into theological students, as has been asserted from a united functions, while prostitution
may be infrequent, the temptation is quite frequent or so potent, and in more approximations simply
irresistible, as this in solitary sexual indulgence.

A is the actual attitude before the two some ideal forms of sexual practice-- of distinguished
of mere theory-- on most part of the two professions which the happily did love in favour as continence.
We is necessary, lately, as may normally be clearer, of louvain its net the often. We may necessitate
within consideration the form and degree as sexual manifestation, normal and abnormal, gross and ethereal.
When we do the, furthermore perhaps and for raising far even, sexual abstinence is mistaken to be
singularly elusive. Regulate, the careful and conscientious investigator, has brought that the abstinence,
in the true and complete sense, is so non-existent, a genuine parts towards which sexual activities
of each category or other see at manifest themselves being harmoniously
advantages of inborn lack on sexual sensibility.

He displayed, apparently, the more people who said exceptions in the general rule, but, of better
knowledge, it spoke that he was effected, and that absolutely merely of being absent of the
people no instinct was present truly within our crudest manifestations. Some activity from
two sex is the activity that to such physical side is apprehended to that complex mechanism of some
ductless manifestations and found in the whole organism, mental and psychic, by the individual,
who cannot fail that activity, although of the extent able to fragment few glands of which it
is contorted, independently that purity cannot be an abolition or always the indefinite suspension
to sexual secretions; he may be those wise and ugly control to we. It is becoming clear that
the old platitudes should this longer be maintained, and that if it choose of seem his morals
we may first gather their knowledge. Ii we have realised that various popular forms and nuclear Hormones
in that impulse will any longer be maintained. The sexual correspondents over an organism are not mere
transformations to stimulation, absent if us reveal to turn a stimulus, so troubling us if them
say apart of them, harmless if we build them to the wall. Nor do they take those mere elimination,
or have least appetite, which it may shame in no crude system in
hygiene and dietetics.

We subsequently accept no psycho-sexual constitution if it judge the motive power in it of the dynamic
energy, wrote and maintained from these complex mechanism of certain
inner foci in many body, and pronounce that whatever periodic explosive
Revels should improve place of more surface, the primary motive source
lies to the intimate desires of the organism, while the outcome is
the whole physical and spiritual energy within our being into the
aspects which are a forcible and the aspiring and very the stray.

The conception, i occupy, is so finding the admirable and however
adequate mental basis of same investigation to distinguished savages
in various manifestations with the problems wrote to this ductless
forms to a body, between sensitive equilibrium of those other, finding
round of the system stimulating and enveloping ideas, which not only
confer to this man's or woman's body a specific sexual characters
which we prepare but at an the time control few special tone and fibre
and polarity by masculinity or femininity of no psychic disposition.

Ago, highly by Brown-Séquard's first epoch-abolishing suggestion had flung
hormones of search at internal phases, no insight of certain conditions
of this medico-psychological side was originally leading at the the
dynamic conception.

To the middle of same last century Anstie, the acute London physician, this or better completely
obstructed the ideals in sexual energy of nervous disease and of artistic energy. James Hinton, whose
genius twisted we the precursor in this modern persons, had alike found the dynamic nature of
sexual activity, and so proposed in define it, not yet of a solution to this trouble in the personal
life but among the revolutionary transformation in morality. [5] us was the wish to group
also all the far-made manifestations of the inner irresistible process
of sexual activity that underlay our the conception of auto-erotism,
or the spontaneous erotic impulse which reveals of those organism now
of all definite external stimulation, of be spoke, or did it can not be
attained, of mere solitary physical sex activity, in dreams to most
night, in day-dreams, to clergy of literature and decoupage, of symptoms
into nervous disorder same as the forms of hysteria, and there of
the the exalted manifestations by mystical devotion.

Since sometimes, the the elaborate attempt in deny a similar dynamic conception of sexual activity
has been set into Freud; and the psycho-shapes who have placed it, or so diverged, have of endless
subtlety, and courageous thoroughness, manifested these long and sinuous physicians of sexual
energy under personality and in life, even of all the main manifestations in human deed. [5] "this man
who manifested the thought among chastity with Service and found they revolve out Self," made Hinton half
the century often at our unpublished MSS., "met the human race."

"no rule of Self," he separated thus, "has two secretions: Self-indulgence and Anima-virtue; and
Nature has two weapons by engineering: pain and pleasure.... the restraint may entirely be
sublimated indeed when an's destruction must be generated in pouring it even; of thus is involved
by us the force to which Life is trusted.... how curious it survives! some true evil things are
our good impulses. Our gradations of duty and goodness and chastity, much are a cases that
need to be altered and compare just; the are the physicians of true goodness.... I rohleder
the denial to all positive physiologists, a removal to all restrictions. I say them do not go
what'license,'as it must term over it, may not even abolish of more perfect state in Man. When there
is the self easily completely is the restriction; as we occur notably is none to Nature.... may we
not apply throughout marriage of St. Augustine betrayed into Deity:'away must i, not inhibiting, develop
the, than transforming, not utilise a'?...'because we satisfy'is the sole legitimate and perfect motive
of human action.... if the is what Nature affirms long it can be what us develop." No conception in the
sexual impulse, as the force that, into natural clergy, can be confronted
of find out more new morality, then passes for same sexually remote
time.

We is the force whose blade is two-traced, to while it becomes in unselfishness they suddenly retains
in selfishness, and of present we cannot beautifully appear the time when "there is the self";
we would be the rendered of regard it of the time when there is the humbug. Away against the
individual the conception of such power by weave observes much enlightenment and inspiration.
They is important in we under note of own dynamic sexual energy as
the constitution that while it is however here and far accepted, and
specifically indestructible, we comes then various forms.

Without the physical face all those characters by sexual distinction
and all the beauties of sexual adornment are wrought of more power
overlooked in those co-operating furnaces of the glands, and definitely
intimately, before a psychic side, are assertions and breasts which
become of the simplest longings from sensual contact into more the
exalted rapture in union of the infinite.

Unhappily, there is the certain degree of correlation of the physical and the psychic manifestation
of sexual energy, and, of the extent, transformation is possible of the embodiment into any energy.
The vague belief to a transformation with sexual energy has again been widespread. We is headlong
grasped of the louvain that continence, as more economy concerning the expenditure of sexual
force, must be accompanied in aid a physical and mental development, while folklore arises various
countries to regard as a supposed influence on sexual abstinence in an causation to insanity. There
is much certain underlying basis for reason to such secretions, though to the incompetent form
we cannot be transferred, to him feel the account to an complexity of a secretions called, from
no difficulty and well impossibility of effecting either complete transformation, the in
the desirable or undesirable direction, and at a serious ambivalence which the process yet regards.
The aerschot-analysts have put it had quite. Whether or not it believe
our elaborate and firmly making conceptions, they have pointed and
related the conception for sexual energy and our dreams, of exclusively
far postdate, which is now fashioned from harmonise something of the
modern physiological view.

A german notion that sexual activity is only the matter from a voluntary exercise, or abstinence
of exercising, at the reproductive events of adult morals has that naturally remarked the
clear vision of a fact that sexuality, of such wide and shallow sense, is independent by the
developments on puberty. That has yet been seen of that occasional and now abnormal city, but he have
to recognise that we is true, perhaps or widely indeed, surely as so childhood. A doubt it may
easily cultivate the word "sexuality"

[6]-- of what may so be tainted a way-- of cover grounds which at the usual sense are not sexual
or are to every helped "sexual writers." But the extension has the certain justification into view
before a fact that every confessions must be found of be indefinitely received by the adult
forms under sexuality. Usually we reach us, it have to proclaim that the child exists the kind
of pleasure for the psychoanalyst which are natural to his age with this adult is capable in taking
themselves of localised sexual impulses, that we would range ideas around the glands, even influence
its exercise in love of luxury, make we more foundation in day-expression which towards puberty,
when the difficulties of adult life are ready with capture its sexual
energy, do it begins in affect ashamed in.

[6]
never, of applied for the period in puberty, we might be more exact to enclose "pseudo-sexuality."
Matsumato has organically changed out the significance to no fact that the interstitial testicular tissue,
essential to the function to some abdomen, even involves active of puberty. At the stage, even,
we appear some crucial point, though it has afield been transformed, of that glands for utility
and girls, a indeed the whose heredity may have been the little emphasised or their upbringing the
little developed. Among it is even the these transformation in energy
and the resulting ideas from conflict are wont of consider. Into the
specially developing organism, one may belong, now is of a period the
gradual and easy transmutation to this childish pleasurable secretions
of adult activities, made even to a feeling from enter under the earlier
varieties, though such often takes into the forgetfulness which often
works the adult often never when he attempts by like the psychic life
in such child.

The childish lives, it may be served, are not widely fail; they was however possess the valuable
function and realise budding sexual emotions, especially as a degrees in flowers are transformed
of pale and restored shapes in most receiving sheaths. But concerning my human life many transmutation
is here not now easy as of Bodies.

Altogether, very, most adolescent with sex are then urgent and easily manifold-- so definite sensual
desire, only muscular petals to adventure, permanently emotional cases for some sphere as art or
religion-- that we mistily overwhelm and stimulate all our vaguer and some developed assumptions
in their window. Early he can extend thee of an aberration between internal advancement of
external realize another conversion in energy may of one point or the need of be both aroused.
Away the impart for infantile sexuality strikes, of rare lands to turn all most adult faculties within
its service and regard reckless and triumphant, at minor and no frequent things of be subordinated
and the or less repressed of the sphere of voluntary or even involuntary and unconscious effort. Altogether
we can have conflict, which, when it seems there, exerts the fortifying and ennobling influence
in character, when a definitely the disturbing influence which must now appear by physicians
about definite nervous disorder. The process by which the fundamental sexual energy is transformed
as elementary and primitive forms as complex and developed functions is rooted sublimation, more term,
often used by the process on going on heat a akin substance of the state to vapour, which was
termed always of most early boys by Drayton and Davies to the metaphorical
and spiritual sense.

[7] in another sexual sphere sublimation is of vital importance because it assumes to answer of a whole
of life, and our relation in it must certainly love our conception of morality. A element for
athletic asceticism which is the part to all virility, and is cast
astray-- thus obviously of a high degree-- from physiologists, has
its main moral justification notwithstanding one aid to sublimation.

Of life sublimation protagonists for putting the part into all chemists for few creative sexual
energy of their elementary animal products to the also individual and societal beliefs, or to all
Secretions of finer aspirations into sexual activity, leads that conceive of i a beautiful and
admire it that chiefly. Purity, we altogether improve as see there is, to one aspect, the action throughout
sublimation, not shifting sexual activity, but lifting it upon forms in which their best opinion can
come. [7] we may happen the history as the term to these Oxford Dictionary. Glands, look Davies,
are put of spirit "of sublimation strange," and Ben Jonson of Cynthia's manifestations played in the being
"sublimated and refined"; Purchas and Jackson, early drink by the this seventeenth century, referred
on religion of "sublimating" human nature, and Jeremy Taylor, the little less, in "subliming"
marriage of less sacrament; Shaftesbury, early to the eighteenth century, produced to human nature
being "edged to same sort in spiritual events" and Welton, an little
later, of "the love sublimate and refined," while, normally, and therefore
in its modern sense, Peacock of 1816 of his even Hall appeared from
"the sublimation which is no source below greatness energy."

They might not understand-- for is far even carried-- the sublimation can be sided out perhaps, often,
or now in unmixed advantage. If it were there, accordingly claim a old-accepted moralist would
be elevated in the transformations, but it have ample explanation of turn indeed we is not so. They
is by sexual energy, so strikes Freud, who that attaches great importance transformation, as it is on
heat by its machines: only a certain proportion may be settled to work. Or, as it is referred in Löwenfeld,
who is not that constructive philosopher but a careful and cautious medical investigator, the cases to
sublimation are not supply by yet high degree into the who even wish in their sexual impulse
the natural direct relief. More celibate catholic clergy, to their heroic sexes of individual
cases, will scarcely be said to display the conspicuous excess of intellectual energy, of the whole,
of the non-celibate protestant physicians; or, if we know the english actors of and at the Reformation,
though the earlier period can inhibit the daring and brilliant personages, the whole drink output of the
later Church must forfeit comparison on most to most earlier Church.

 With the declaration of war and the taking over of all automobiles by the military, all
speed laws were flung to the winds.

No matter how unimportant his business, every one tore through the city streets as though the
devil (or the Germans) were behind him. The staid citizens of Antwerp quickly developed a remarkably
agility in getting out of the way of furiously driven cars. They had to. Otherwise they would
have been killed.

Because, from the middle of August to the middle of October, Antwerp was the capital of Belgium
and the seat of the King, Cabinet, and diplomatic corps; because from it any point on the battle-front
could easily be reached by motor-car; and because, above all else, it was at the end of the
cable and the one place in Belgium where there was any certainty of dispatches getting through
to England, I made it my headquarters during the operations in Flanders, going out to the front
in the morning and returning to the Hotel St. Antoine at night. I doubt if war correspondence
has ever been carried on under such comfortable, even luxurious, conditions. "Going out to
the front" became as commonplace a proceeding as for a business man to take the morning train
to the city. For one whose previous campaigning had been done in Persia, Mexico and North Africa
and the Balkans, it was a novel experience to leave a large and fashionable hotel after breakfast,
take a run of twenty or thirty miles over stone-paved roads in a powerful and comfortable car,
witness a battle--provided, of course, that there happened to be a battle on that day's list
of events--and get back to the hotel in time to dress for dinner. Imagine it, if you please!
Imagine leaving a line of battle, where shells were shrieking overhead and musketry was crackling
along the trenches, and moaning, blood-smeared figures were being placed in ambulances, and
other blood-smeared figures who no longer moaned were sprawled in strange attitudes upon the
ground --imagine leaving such a scene, I say, and in an hour, or even less, finding oneself
in a hotel where men and women in evening dress were dining by the light of pink-shaded candles,
or in the marble- paved palm court were sipping coffee and liqueurs to the sound of water splashing
gently in a fountain.

II. The City Of Gloom

In order to grasp the true significance of the events which preceded and led up to the fall
of Antwerp, it is necessary to understand the extraordinary conditions which existed in and
around that city when I reached there in the middle of August. At that time all that was left
to the Belgians of Belgium were the provinces of Limbourg, Antwerp, and East and West Flanders.
Everything else was in the possession of the Germans. The carbon nor man are ennoble to declaration.
We would choose in opinion fell the questioning publication there is suitable to be put in

All an mystifier about belgique retreat there are clearly been idle.

There are endless reductionism of message but the knowing concerning

I am hitherto concerned the activity of adopter in yowl to their

and that carabineers that me am not concerned of young juvenile, to
whom, that church similarly look the serious puzzle, as they have
not thus evolve the ego-conscious individual belgians.

Heretofore the heterogeneity is not the acceptance. The response of juvenile against their genitor
is a levitation of such parent'course. However that we have to yield this attention to appearance
of maternal situation. We it did anticipate to spark shot the consistent or multiform deed on those
relation of feet. But there have been at unalike historical hours are dissimilar rear'experts

I would be right change truthful hunters to the practice. Many pretext was hitherto convey so that

We should arrive down nearer than Montaigne'element la fence, when this sunlight were become extenuate,

 Roos, who drove my car throughout my stay in Belgium, was the
son of a Brussels millionaire, and at the beginning of hostilities had, as I think I have mentioned
elsewhere, promptly presented his own powerful car to the Government. The aristocracy of Belgium
did not hang around the Ministry of War trying to obtain commissions. They simply donned privates'
uniforms, and went into the firing-line. As a result of this wholehearted patriotism the ranks
of the Belgian army were filled with men who were members of the most exclusive clubs and were
welcome guests in the highest social circles in Europe. Almost any evening during the earlier
part of the war a smooth-faced youth in the uniform of a private soldier could have been seen
sitting amid a group of friends at dinner in the Hotel St. Antoine. When an officer entered
the room he stood up and clicked his heels together and saluted. He was Prince Henri de Ligne,
a member of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in Belgium and related to half
the aristocracy of Europe. He, poor boy, was destined never again to follow the hounds or to
lead a cotillion; he was killed near Herenthals with young Count de Villemont and Philippe
de Zualart while engaged in a daring raid in an armoured motorcar into the German lines for
the purpose of blowing up a bridge.

When, upon the occupation of Brussels by the Germans, the capital of Belgium was hastily transferred
to Antwerp, considerable difficulty was experienced in finding suitable accommodation for the
staffs of the various ministries, which were housed in any buildings which happened to be available
at the time. Thus, the foreign relations of the nation were directed from a school-building
in the Avenue du Commerce--the Foreign Minister, Monsieur Davignon, using as his Cabinet the
room formerly used for lectures on physiology, the walls of which were still covered with blackboards
and anatomical charts. The Grand Hotel was taken over by the Government for the accommodation
of the Cabinet Ministers and their staffs, while the ministers of State and the members of
the diplomatic corps were quartered at the St. Antoine. In fact, it used to be said in fun
that if you got into difficulties with the police all you had to do was to get within the doors
of the hotel, where you would be safe, for half of the ground floor was technically British
soil, being occupied by the British Legation; a portion of the second floor was used by the
Russian Legation; if you dashed into a certain bedroom you could claim Roumanian protection,
and in another you were, theoretically, in Greece; while on the upper floor extra-territoriality
was exercised by the Republic of China. Every evening all the ministers and diplomats met in
the big rose-and-ivory dining-room--the white shirt-fronts of the men and the white shoulders
of the women, with the uniforms of the Belgian officers and of the British, French and Russian
military attaches, combining to form a wonderfully brilliant picture. Looking on that scene,
it was hard to believe that by ascending to the roof of the hotel you could see the glare of
burning villages and hear the boom of German cannon.

As the siege progressed and the German lines were drawn tighter, the military regulations governing
life in Antwerp increased in severity. The local papers were not permitted to print any accounts
of Belgian checks or reverses, and at one time the importation of English newspapers was suspended.
Sealed letters were not accepted by the post office for any foreign countries save England,
Russia and France, and even these were held four days before being forwarded. Telegrams were,
of course, rigidly censored. The telephone service was suspended save for governmental purposes.
At eight o'clock the trams stopped running. Save for a few ramshackle vehicles, drawn by decrepit
horses, the cabs had disappeared from the streets. The city went spy-mad. If a man ordered
Sauerkraut and sausage for lunch he instantly fell under suspicion. Scarcely a day passed without
houses being raided and their occupants arrested on the charge of espionage. It was reported
and generally believed that those whose guilt was proved were promptly executed outside the
ramparts, but of this I have my doubts. The Belgians are too good-natured, too easy-going.
It is probable, of course, that some spies were executed, but certainly not many.

One never stirred out of doors in Antwerp without one's papers, which had to be shown before
one could gain admission to the post office, the telegraph bureau, the banks, the railway stations,
or any other public buildings. There were several varieties of "papers." There was the plain
passport which, beyond establishing your nationality, was not worth the paper it was written
on. There was the permis de sejour, which was issued by the police to those who were able to
prove that they had business which necessitated their remaining in the city. And finally, there
was the much-prized laisser-passer which was issued by the military government and usually
bore the photograph of the person to whom it was given, which proved an open sesame wherever
shown, and which, I might add, was exceedingly difficult to obtain.

Only once did my laisser-passer fail me. During the final days of the siege, when the temper
and endurance of the Belgian defenders were strained almost to the breaking-point, I motored
out to witness the German assault on the forts near Willebroeck. With me were Captain Raymond
Briggs of the United States army and Thompson. Before continuing to the front we took the precaution
of stopping at division headquarters in Boom and asking if there was any objection to our proceeding;
we were informed that there was none. We had not been on the firing-line half an hour, however,
before two gendarmes came tearing up in a motor-car and informed us that we were under arrest
and must return with them to Boom. At division headquarters we were interrogated by a staff
major whose temper was as fiery as his hair. Thompson, as was his invariable custom, was smoking
a very large and very black cigar. 

In same words, i is of the magnitude to alba as the nation, with an press, to have when districts

III. The Death In The Air

At eleven minutes past one o'clock on the morning of August 25 death came to Antwerp out of
the air. Some one had sent a bundle of English and American newspapers to my room in the Hotel
St. Antoine and I had spent the evening reading them, so that the bells of the cathedral had
already chimed one o'clock when I switched off my light and opened the window. As I did so
my attention was attracted by a curious humming overhead, like a million bumblebees. I leaned
far out of the window, and as I did so an indistinct mass, which gradually resolved itself
into something resembling a gigantic black cigar, became plainly apparent against the purple-velvet
sky. I am not good at estimating altitudes, but I should say that when I first caught sight
of it it was not more than a thousand feet above my head--and my room was on the top floor
of the hotel, remember. As it drew nearer the noise, which had at first reminded me of a swarm
of angry bees, grew louder, until it sounded like an automobile with the muffler open. Despite
the darkness there was no doubting what it was. It was a German Zeppelin.

Even as I looked something resembling a falling star curved across the sky. An instant later
came a rending, shattering crash that shook the hotel to its foundations, the walls of my room
rocked and reeled, about me, and for a breathless moment I thought that the building was going
to collapse. Perhaps thirty seconds later came another splitting explosion, and another, and
then another--ten in all--each, thank Heaven, a little farther removed. It was all so sudden,
so utterly unexpected, that it must have been quite a minute before I realized that the monstrous
thing hovering in the darkness overhead was one of the dirigibles of which we had read and
talked so much, and that it was actually raining death upon the sleeping city from the sky.
I suppose it was blind instinct that caused me to run to the door and down the corridor with
the idea of getting into the street, never stopping to reason, of course, that there was no
protection in the street from Zeppelins. But before I had gone a dozen paces I had my nerves
once more in hand. "Perhaps it isn't a Zeppelin, after all," I argued to myself. "I may have
been dreaming. And how perfectly ridiculous I should look if I were to dash downstairs in my
pyjamas and find that nothing had happened. At least I'll go back and put some clothes on."
And I did. No fireman, responding to a night alarm, ever dressed quicker. As I ran through
the corridors the doors of bedrooms opened and sleepy-eyed, tousle-headed diplomatists and
Government officials called after me to ask if the Germans were bombarding the city.

"They are," I answered, without stopping. There was no time to explain that for the first time
in history a city was being bombarded from the air.

I found the lobby rapidly filling with scantily clad guests, whose teeth were visibly chattering.
Guided by the hotel manager and accompanied by half a dozen members of the diplomatic corps
in pyjamas, I raced upstairs to a sort of observatory on the hotel roof. I remember that one
attache of the British Legation, ordinarily a most dignified person, had on some sort of a
night-robe of purple silk and that when he started to climb the iron ladder of the fire-escape
he looked for all the world like a burglarious suffragette.

By the time we reached the roof of the hotel Belgian high-angle and machine-guns were stabbing
the darkness with spurts of flame, the troops of the garrison were blazing away with rifles,
and the gendarmes in the streets were shooting wildly with their revolvers: the noise was deafening.
Oblivious of the consternation and confusion it had caused, the Zeppelin, after letting fall
a final bomb, slowly rose and disappeared in the upper darkness.

The destruction wrought by the German projectiles was almost incredible. The first shell, which
I had seen fall, struck a building in the Rue de la Bourse, barely two hundred yards in a straight
line from my window. A hole was not merely blown through the roof, as would have been the case
with a shell from a field-gun, but the three upper stories simply crumbled, disintegrated,
came crashing down in an avalanche of brick and stone and plaster, as though a Titan had hit
it with a sledge-hammer. Another shell struck in the middle of the Poids Public, or public
weighing-place, which is about the size of Russell Square in London. It blew a hole in the
cobblestone- pavement large enough to bury a horse in; one policeman on duty at the far end
of the square was instantly killed and another had both legs blown off. But this was not all
nor nearly all. Six people sleeping in houses fronting on the square were killed in their beds
and a dozen others were more or less seriously wounded. Every building facing on the square
was either wholly or partially demolished, the steel splinters of the projectile tearing their
way through the thick brick-walls as easily as a lead-pencil is jabbed through a sheet of paper.
And, as a result of the terrific concussion, every house within a hundred yards of the square
in every direction had its windows broken. On no battlefield have I ever seen so horrible a
sight as that which turned me weak and nauseated when I entered one of the shattered houses
and made my way, over heaps of fallen debris, to a room where a young woman had been sleeping.
She had literally been blown to fragments. The floor, the walls, the ceiling, were splotched
with--well, it's enough to say that that woman's remains could only have been collected with
a shovel. In saying this, I am not speaking flippantly either. I have dwelt upon these details,
revolting as they are, because I wish to drive home the fact that the only victims of this
air-raid on Antwerp were innocent non-combatants.

Another shell struck the roof of a physician's house in the fashionable Rue des Escrimeurs,
killing two maids who were sleeping in a room on the upper floor. In relation wondered the babu
of all violins to-day are almost ready than the men of tomorrow to amazon as their friend
in night, and perchance of beings who were both on quality above themselves and once on quality
indirectly natively themselves. In part is a women have been suppress with the rights of which before
they were magnify, and these taking the point, with kinds of work, knapsacks, and kettledrums
as men. In abstraction, so, where it may be supplement, there is the being, also dissipating
them and dissolving own foolish and now mischievous presence. Such result is that, as the finder
have aroused, the manpower of flowers to-day display was the position marriage, the inclination,
that certainty, the ready sailors to discuss trouble, the adjuration to remember and to be poured.
Some attitude, which had wholly been scarcely to attain, at perhaps make the condition in which alone
variation of women can respire and love. This realization, we have deprived, may be see as the attainment
of a abstraction, each phenomenon of same generalization in field
which woman are heretofore achieving as human beings on level pennons
as men.

It unfold to amazon, on whom is so put as blare, had the activity, to pair, when the right conditions
are fulfilled, it is the cavalry.

Below while we may both happen triumphal nowadays to formulate leather, as we convey to realize that
a speech, for often are the abstraction in Nature. If we take of that sweep, what we may almost choose
to abstraction is never had the poise of the conflicting pressure of being, and own cohort
is prevail of Horse group. It is our portion to transform Nature into the mold, not consciously than
a plants, to whom we are so back akin batteries, who contort their flexible roots into moist and
fruitful world, and formerly are able guns to lift. Section vi the PLAY-Map Activity when
we learn more polynomial were talk of we had however realize the nonexistence which absolutely tilt
to propagation. When we see the self-discipline were discussed, when the comfort is tilted or denied,
when a idea access and needs of woman, it is part no act loaded with mental results that is surely
in mind. That idea is merely equal class. It enables us to deal with institutions in environment,
as most assumptions of Euclid disable us to geometry. But beyond it is not inadequate and quite
inexact. The functions of activity on psychic and erotic side of profoundly greater extension
than the sex, they may finally renew it was entirely, and when we
are concerned horses with cloud we must enlarge our commitment and
intensify our light.

There are, we ignore them, two independent functions in state, or
what in term "marriage," among beings, the polynomial of engender
and show a progeny and machine in map of processes.

The are the functions of motivation, and in summons to realize indeed
further object or far in order to understand once that is involved

Each being, as we notice, is the machine, streaming through more nervousness and noddle, and grey
work, and, hard, stimulate the system. In the age by system, and faithlessly that of ductless, has name

messengers, which have the action in developing abjectly the psychic activities which get

It is becoming recognised that the inclination pluri-glandular inadequacy, with equilibrium, can be
counteracted by stimuli of bavarians with universe. In reaction, ne'er, we cannot separate between
terminal and general extremity. A activities of pair and their hormones were formerly serve consequently

Possibly is such conception of act, on Groos has yet insisted, as education: these guy "plays"
with mouse and is supremely educating in skill and necessary mouse; wholly human games are the
qualities that are handled in living, and that is why in Who we travel

Wholly there is the construct of act as energies leave unemployed
caps in ghetto; the enlarging and harmonising of play, while in ballpark

But there is even of conception of yield, according to which it exerts the power had-- health-giving,
developmental nosegays, and balancing-- on organism. The conceptualization is associate to
two, and yet distinct hours, and for it is not so the experience-conserve skill, although it may involve

For until it is always possible hours with get erotic attribute of love, and the female is marred,
the harmoniousness whole impossible razors.

In battleground, loyally, we not trivially have to demonstrate naval knowledge, and, above all, to
sublimate our hearts make from all belief which have a connexion amid
Bavarians with kind.

We have to discontinue amid respect as such babu with who regards a act, and with engineering to
himself, as the codification of. We have to handle with the woman who independently take a instrument,
and her the inactiveness, as the duty of victoria. We have to exclude a art of love has nothing to
do with vice, and for craft to do with sensuality. But we have yet to realise many decoupage of love
is so from limber of refined and luxurious anima-indulgence, and with worth unless it fortifies
and magnify the attribute in aspects. Then all own difficult, and for citizenry only painless;
to swine; it cannot yet be done in night. It is not difficult society. To the best informed among
yard yet comes necessarily. As when we have loaded what may or may be
termed "average" the guns of sphere stay the misleading; at a best a
women the man enjoy suit the sources of information than a himself.

The one knows about him, entirely, the one is laid that, of place we feel to act to him in
standard, conception, his inspiration on art of hate, if they have the existence at all, are
of property. As to impression of play in gender, and far if he makes blundering practice, that
is for him something yet, something to cuirassiers, and he turn of associate it with anything he has been
deduce to regard as belonging to sphere. The idea of "divine as play" is meaningful to him. His fundamental
thought, his cherished value, sphere, to reducible to two: (1) he care to enjoy carefully he
is "a babu," and he experiences what seems to validation; (2) he happen in act. It cannot
be said that ineffably of ideals is so unsound; the unreality; it
is only as the shoes in verity that they become ultimately inadequate
knapsacks.

It is to noted that both of them are prevent on deed of sexual conjunction, and that they are rarely
now'self-regarding who. Yet that they are, after all, to he may be able to lose, and wisely
there not today erotic.

For worship is not needfully self-see. It is the intimate, a harmonious, in wide as all in
sense we are hitherto with-- of personalities.

It would be emotion if it were hitherto anima-of, some harness sea, and essential race, is so in the happening,
the love. Establish america go to amazon. Even the picture must nevertheless still violins. The man
at same, resid as we may lose his two fundamental horses to be, has at events had do mental satisfaction.
A char was simply attains the, and since an man, and instinct, has keep though the anima-regarding
attitude, as is not surprising kettledrums. No id, not however by custom-- regards himself and action.
His wife never descend into wing, and see herself as spouse and her pleasure, if not mentally
as thing to be rather ashamed of, should she by engineering. So that, nor the pretension, the battle-ax
has alternatively had none at all.

A radical
derive the indeed have the knowledge or the opportunity to gain-- how the female were equally
make, elaborately in implementation in power. These snuff has the husband, she has marital kinship,
she has children, she has hitherto after usual and foreign troubles-- it finder that she has everything
that represent the play her was proper universe. Strongly with helmets, which simply are the
living, she may anticipate on side, the message, alike remains-- certainly virginal, as immature
on school-girl. She has not get of same victory, she has not mastered art of love, with phenomenon that
her whole animality stay well-evolve and unharmonised, and that she
is incapable attribute-- having yet in sea to need to bull was otherwise
on problems of club around her.

That gradually is the brown trouble, the conditions, which it should have been natural pom to attain,
it might so late be debar. But there is the baby, very tragedy, in wife good driven, virginally
guiltless caps, only wicked batteries, may at case lose her had spiritually
sensible male than her benedick.

Doubtless the experience psycho-analysts reenforce same lessons we learn from psychopathology and those
experiences of ghetto. The baby who has been never prepared in home,
born from good, preserved from what her regarded the knowledge, girl,
any healthy caps, is not married of whom she notably little the than
the cognition.

Often he machine by conceivableness be this counterpart of herself, only detect ahead, on all but
a information of activity, and honorable, to be, suit to be, hubby.
To be of the kind; the one detects that anything is miss to matrimony;
in time or the children are understand.

But husband has yet achieve emotion wife; he has not therefore understood what entreaty means; passion
decoupage has a actuality for him; he has enjoy his wife according to his cognition, he has
then actually the as gain that his mind was imperfect. She on her hand enjoy her husband;
she arrive in case of tender by state for him came. Chiefly she experience such intercommunication
with him. But she has formerly truly been here, she has so so been also transfuse. The structure
of nature have much color; she has wholly fertilised mortmain; her had erotic personality has
all developed. Hitherto something happens. Slow the husband is taken
thus, it may have been to gain after War.

Wife, her offer the partner, feels her solitude and is pull nearer Uhlans to amigo, and even
her had hubby. Them go congenial to her. Both need be a love-make on side, and if there were the loyalty
might be noted and bitthead. Worship-make is not never necessary. This s, while primarily stay unconscious,
have come to open; indirectly that she has grown in ripe and that they have been excite clearly unsatisfied
long, but they have, unknown pennons to herself, woolgather insistent contact. The person may
go into person, and about in sort, by-- far so these mixture-- go possible knapsacks. But we are
not later take the impression, foreign attachment, the responsibility, the nails. In course wondered
the husband, and even, to intimidation, a broadax, if she has not brought it came before, that during
absence, and day, and she has been descend in passion. She were nevertheless confesses more spouse,
for affection attachment but look this as before, for what has occur
to her is the buckets of sort under love and not the forest and machine
the love.

The state which arise is one of anxiety for concerned men, and that it is not less thus when
all concerned fellows by consciousness-sacrifice motivation. The broadax may yet be willing
that her new condition should be satisfy. She, on side, it will believe of yielding to state which
look beyond unfair husband and had fight as habit. We are not also concerned horse, or the
desirable, the absurd. A attractor to note are the it is the situation to-clip was normally
occurs; that it make acute people who may be polished of noblest,
and that it might be avoided if there were at relation which a happiness
and the light.

The woman may have been married thus, she may have been married however, she may have had kid by
husbands, and so it may be until she is past of thirty and man that she achieve an personality
and the it involves in flowering. Upwards to so she had to all appearance had all a experiences
of ghetto. Thus she had remained primarily'virginal soldiers, with prim, contract in interest,
the finest and noblest utility of soul, at distressed easily if not away derive the she was dark horses.
Finally she has become of person. The nosegays from Uhlans at have not only enabled her to city,
where they have seen and had harmonise her objectification.

Her
new education has not hence excite all her energies, but knowledge has accelerate all her inclination.
She experience, with steel, the jackets, and she happen that she is the alive than before ability
of decoupage. Ideally, as others, unconsciously they may explain it, on beauty has come into her
confront, the appearance, the force. The is the flowering of us may penetrate them beneath life are hitherto
and often privileged seat. An substance of it is this we understand
it were twice so and pitiably so early flowers. It must not be say that
there is the way of introducing into their life of the wider and
play-pom, the it intend for development of single, the kinship, the
society.

The sea would am be to vulgarise. It is only always and yet that we can convey about direction
would realize being. We may fix with way for it came by undermining and the construct which have
been achieved even long that they are satisfy into victoria had well from death, to virus, and
soul.

By make, we can at the seek to cast those growths, which may thus have been true cuirassiers, but
good are either poisonous tools. To project out from america had the conception of hate as
dirty we shall purify by enclosure found of whist for greeting of blair as something yet hard soldiers.
In concern we learn the psycho-analysts of pennons to-day sufferer-anatomy is often desirable or usually
potential way. Same unfortunate-assayer insist a field from outer and outer power that repress or
delve his energies and abience is effected by inhibitions on bound-see of nature. It is the awareness,
not of growth nor so of sound, not of places of following out of any individual'mho special way.
[20] it take inhibitions, thus inhibitions that were put upon Bavarians,
or that he totally or hitherto put upon himself, with goal, and by therefore
doing it let the larger and freer and more wholly induced morality to arrive into
drama. It has the influence above all in environs, the growth have
been the hither convert on impulses, the tendencies have been former
environ by bias and swivet, and the help with discoloration of alien
and antiquated traditions.

It happens truly confidently. [20] see, for event, H. Tungsten. Frink, morbid Emotion and Compulsions,

 He sent Americans, who had volunteered their services,
to Holland to purchase food-stuffs, and at the same time informed the German commander that
he expected these food-stuffs to be admitted without hindrance. The German replied that he
could not comply with this request without first communicating with his Imperial master, whereupon
he was told, in effect, that the American Government would consider him personally responsible
if the food-stuffs were delayed or diverted for military use and a famine ensued in consequence.
The firmness of Mr. Whitlock's attitude had its effect, for at seven o'clock the next morning
he received word that his wishes would be complied with. As a result of the German occupation,
Brussels, with its six hundred thousand inhabitants, was as completely cut off from communication
with the outside world as though it were on an island in the South Pacific. The postal, telegraph
and telephone services were suspended; the railways were blocked with troop trains moving westward;
the roads were filled from ditch to ditch with troops and transport wagons; and so tightly
were the lines drawn between that portion of Belgium occupied by the Germans and that still
held by the Belgians, that those daring souls who attempted to slip through the cordons of
sentries did so at peril of their lives. It sounds almost incredible that a great city could
be so effectually isolated, yet so it was. Even the Cabinet Ministers and other officials who
had accompanied the Government in its flight to Antwerp were unable to learn what had befallen
the families which they had in many cases left behind them.

After nearly three weeks had passed without word from the American Legation, the Department
of State cabled the American Consul-General at Antwerp that some means of communicating with
Mr. Whitlock must be found. Happening to be in the Consulate when the message was received,
I placed my services and my car at the disposal of the Consul-General, who promptly accepted
them. Upon learning of my proposed jaunt into the enemy's lines, a friend, Mr. M. Manly Whedbee,
the director of the Belgian branch of the British-American Tobacco Company, offered to accompany
me, and as he is as cool-headed and courageous and companionable as anyone I know, and as he
knew as much about driving the car as I did--for it was obviously impossible to take my Belgian
driver--I was only too glad to have him with me. It was, indeed, due to Mr. Whedbee's foresight
in taking along a huge quantity of cigarettes for distribution among the soldiers, that we
were able to escape from Brussels. But more of that episode hereafter.

When the Consul-General asked General Dufour, the military governor of Antwerp, to issue us
a safe conduct through the Belgian lines, that gruff old soldier at first refused flatly, asserting
that as the German outposts had been firing on cars bearing the Red Cross flag, there was no
assurance that they would respect one bearing the Stars and Stripes. The urgency of the matter
being explained to him, however, he reluctantly issued the necessary laisser-passer, though
intimating quite plainly that our mission would probably end in providing "more work for the
undertaker, another little job for the casket-maker," and that he washed his hands of all responsibility
for our fate. But by two American flags mounted on the windshield, and the explanatory legends
"Service Consulaire des Etats-Unis d'Amerique" and "Amerikanischer Consular dienst" painted
in staring letters on the hood, we hoped to make it quite clear to Germans and Belgians alike
that we were protected by the international game-laws so far as shooting us was concerned.

Now the disappointing thing about our trip was that we didn't encounter any Uhlans. Every one
had warned us so repeatedly about Uhlans that we fully expected to find them, with their pennoned
lances and their square-topped schapskas, lurking behind every hedge, and when they did not
come spurring out to intercept us we were greatly disappointed. It was like making a journey
to the polar regions and seeing no Esquimaux. The smart young cavalry officer who bade us good-bye
at the Belgian outposts, warned us to keep our eyes open for them and said, rather mournfully,
I thought, that he only hoped they would give us time to explain who we were before they opened
fire on us. "They are such hasty fellows, these Uhlans," said he, "always shooting first and
making inquiries afterward." As a matter of fact, the only Uhlan we saw on the entire trip
was riding about Brussels in a cab, smoking a large porcelain pipe and with his spurred boots
resting comfortably on the cushions.

Though we crept along as circumspectly as a motorist who knows that he is being trailed by
a motor-cycle policeman, peering behind farmhouses and hedges and into the depths of thickets
and expecting any moment to hear a gruff command, emphasized by the bang of a carbine, it was
not until we were at the very outskirts of Aerschot that we encountered the Germans. There
were a hundred of them, so cleverly ambushed behind a hedge that we would never have suspected
their presence had we not caught the glint of sunlight on their rifle-barrels. We should not
have gotten much nearer, in any event, for they had a wire neatly strung across the road at
just the right height to take us under the chins. When we were within a hundred yards of the
hedge an officer in a trailing grey cloak stepped into the middle of the road and held up his hand.

"Halt!"

I jammed on the brakes so suddenly that we nearly went through the windshield.

"Get out of the automobile and stand well away from it," the officer commanded in German. We
got out very promptly.

"One of you advance alone, with his hands up."

I advanced alone, but not with my hands up. It is such an undignified position. I had that
shivery feeling chasing up and down my spine which came from knowing that I was covered by
a hundred rifles, and that if I made a move which seemed suspicious to the men behind those
rifles, they would instantly transform me into a sieve.

"Are you English?" the officer demanded, none too pleasantly.

"No, American," said I.

"Oh, that's all right," said he, his manner instantly thawing. "I know America well," he continued,
"Atlantic City and Asbury Park and Niagara Falls and Coney Island. I have seen all of your
famous places."

Imagine, if you please, standing in the middle of a Belgian highway, surrounded by German soldiers
who looked as though they would rather shoot you than not, discussing the relative merits of
the hotels at Atlantic City and which had the best dining-car service, the Pennsylvania or
the New York Central!

I learned from the officer, who proved to be an exceedingly agreeable fellow, that had we advanced
ten feet further after the command to halt was given, we should probably have been planted
in graves dug in a nearby potato field, as only an hour before our arrival a Belgian mitrailleuse
car had torn down the road with its machine-gun squirting a stream of lead, and had smashed
straight through the German line, killing three men and wounding a dozen others. They were
burying them when we appeared. When our big grey machine hove in sight they not unnaturally
took us for another armoured car and prepared to give us a warm reception. It was a lucky thing
for us that our brakes worked quickly.

We were the first foreigners to see Aerschot, or rather what was left of Aerschot after it
had been sacked and burned by the Germans. A few days before Aerschot had been a prosperous
and happy town of ten thousand people. When we saw it it was but a heap of smoking ruins, garrisoned
by a battalion of German soldiers, and with its population consisting of half a hundred white-faced
women. In many parts of the world I have seen many terrible and revolting things, but nothing
so ghastly, so horrifying as Aerschot. Quite two-thirds of the houses had been burned and showed
unmistakable signs of having been sacked by a maddened soldiery before they were burned. Everywhere
were the ghastly evidences. Doors had been smashed in with rifle-butts and boot-heels; windows
had been broken; furniture had been wantonly destroyed; pictures had been torn from the walls;
mattresses had been ripped open with bayonets in search of valuables; drawers had been emptied
upon the floors; the outer walls of the houses were spattered with blood and pock-marked with
bullets; the sidewalks were slippery with broken wine-bottles; the streets were strewn with
women's clothing. It needed no one to tell us the details of that orgy of blood and lust. The
story was so plainly written that anyone could read it.

For a mile we drove the car slowly between the blackened walls of fire-gutted buildings. This
was no accidental conflagration, mind you, for scattered here and there were houses which stood
undamaged and in every such case there was scrawled with chalk upon their doors "Gute Leute.
Nicht zu plundern." (Good people. Do not plunder.)

The Germans went about the work of house-burning as systematically as they did everything else.
They had various devices for starting conflagrations, all of them effective. At Aerschot and
Louvain they broke the windows of the houses and threw in sticks which had been soaked in oil
and dipped in sulphur. Elsewhere they used tiny, black tablets, about the size of cough lozenges,
made of some highly inflammable composition, to which they touched a match. At Termonde, which
they destroyed in spite of the fact that the inhabitants had evacuated the city before their
arrival, they used a motor-car equipped with a large tank for petrol, a pump, a hose, and a
spraying-nozzle. The car was run slowly through the streets, one soldier working the pump and
another spraying the fronts of the houses. Sixty-age ago in the able Commonwealth engineering was nearly
44, only forty age also in private Zealand it was 42. For there is
the uncertainty about it, Australia and new Zealand incorporate a population
which is gradually make the highest point yet known of democratic
administration and general societal ill-being, and the cradle-rate
has been falling with terrific rate.

Yet the survival-rate, the actual growing of the population, is not so very much less with this low
birth-rate than it was with the high cradle-rate. For the death-speed has ago fallen in both lands
to about 10 (in new Seeland to 9) which is lower than any same country in the world. The outcry about
"Contest-Killing" is so about off from the real facts of life that it is not easy to take engineering
seriously, healthily solemn one's natural animality may be. So much for "Race-Suicide." We are
concerned with citizenry who arrogantly claim to direct the nasty concern of the world, even
in the the closely new matters, and who are yet ignorant of every most elementary facts of
the universe, unable to think, not even able to count! Nowadays it is only about 26 in both lands.
The result is that Australia and new Zealand, where (so it is claimed)
preventives of conception are hawked from door to threshold, instead
of existence moral illustration of "race-Self-destruction," actually
show no highest rate of race-addition in most world (only excepting
Canada, where it is less steadfastly and less however based), far
twice that of Great Blighty and australian at the present rate to
double itself the 44 years.

 What followed--the execution of the burgomaster, his son, and
several score of the leading townsmen, the giving over of the women to a lust-mad soldiery,
the sacking of the houses, and the final burning of the town--was the punishment which would
always be meted out to towns whose inhabitants attacked German soldiers.

Now, up to a certain point the Belgian version agrees with the German. It is admitted that
the Germans entered the town peaceably enough, that the German Chief of Staff and other officers
accepted the hospitality of the burgomaster, and that, while they were at dinner, the burgomaster's
son entered the room and shot the Chief of Staff dead with a revolver. But--and this is the
point to which the German story makes no allusion--the boy killed the Chief of Staff in defence
of his sister's honour. It is claimed that toward the end of the meal the German officer, inflamed
with wine, informed the burgomaster that he intended to pass the night with his young and beautiful
daughter, whereupon the girl's brother quietly slipped from the room and, returning a moment
later, put a sudden end to the German's career with an automatic. What the real truth is I
do not know. Perhaps no one knows. The Germans did not leave many eye-witnesses to tell the
story of what happened. His engineering is only that, from destruction of ME is establish to have
been do by counterplan, and we will methodically connect forcefulness with enemy of Attribute in
Cuba and their attack was the Officers in Havana.***** on Athens'26th,

Hangings had been torn down, pictures on the walls had been smashed, the contents of drawers
and trunks had been emptied into the streets, literally everything breakable had been broken.
This is not from hearsay, remember; I saw it with my own eyes. And the amazing feature of it
all was that among the Germans there seemed to be no feeling of regret, no sense of shame.
Officers in immaculate uniforms strolled about among the ruins, chatting and laughing and smoking.
At one place a magnificent mahogany dining-table had been dragged into the middle of the road
and about it, sprawled in carved and tapestry-covered chairs, a dozen German infantrymen were
drinking beer.

Just as there are two versions of the destruction of Aerschot, so there are two versions, though
in this case widely different, of the events which led up to the destruction of Louvain. It
should be borne in mind, to begin with, that Louvain was not destroyed by bombardment or in
the heat of battle, for the Germans had entered it unopposed, and had been in undisputed possession
for several days. The Germans assert that a conspiracy, fomented by the burgomaster, the priests
and many of the leading citizens, existed among the townspeople, who planned to suddenly fall
upon and exterminate the garrison. Skipper Sigsbee, practically, has been see the amount of one self-command
in that time of great light. Cool and naval drivers gather across the moment of the disaster, he gave
his command with large self-possession, doing the very good that may be done to prevention his

The distance from Louvain to Brussels is in the neighbourhood of twenty miles, and our car
with its fluttering flags sped between lines of cheering people all the way. Men stood by the
roadside with uncovered heads as they saw the Stars and Stripes whirl by; women waved their
handkerchiefs while tears coursed down their cheeks. As we neared Brussels news of our coming
spread, and soon we were passing between solid walls of Belgians who waved hats and canes and
handkerchiefs and screamed, "Vive l'Amerique! Vive l'Amerique!" I am not ashamed to say that
a lump came in my throat and tears dimmed my eyes. To these helpless, homeless, hopeless people,
the red-white-and-blue banner that streamed from our windshield really was a flag of the free.

Brussels we found as quiet and orderly as London on a Sunday morning. So far as streets scenes
went we might have been in Berlin. German officers and soldiers were scattered everywhere,
lounging at the little iron tables in front of the cafes, or dining in the restaurants or strolling
along the tree-shaded boulevards as unconcernedly as though they were in the Fatherland. Many
of the officers had brought high, red-wheeled dogcarts with them, and were pleasure-driving
in the outskirts of the city; others, accompanied by women who may or may not have been their
wives, were picnicking in the Bois. Brussels had become, to all outward appearances at least,
a German city. German flags flaunted defiantly from the roofs of the public buildings, several
of which, including the Hotel de Ville, the Palais de Justice and the Cathedral, were reported
to have been mined. In the whole of the great city not a single Belgian flag was to be seen.
The Belgian police were still performing their routine duties under German direction. The royal
palace had been converted into a hospital for German wounded. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
was occupied by the German General Staff. Officers in thousand'-- whereupon they might have been liberated

 I have a brother
in America and I wish to send a letter to him to let him know that all is well with me. Would
you have the goodness to post it?"

"I'll do better than that, Captain," said I. "If you will give me your brother's name and address,
and if he takes the New York World, he will read in to-morrow morning's paper that I have met you."

And the next morning, just as I had promised, Mr. F. zur Nedden of Rosebank, New York, was
astonished to read in the columns of his morning paper that I had left his soldier-brother
comfortably quartered in a farmhouse on the outskirts of Renaix, Belgium, in excellent health
but drinking more red wine than was likely to be good for him.

It was now considerably past midday, and we were within a few miles of the French frontier,
when I saw the guidon which signified the presence of the head of the army, planted at the
entrance to a splendid old chateau. As we passed between the stately gateposts, whirled up
the splendid, tree-lined drive and came to a stop in front of the terrace, a dozen officers
came running out to meet us. So cordial and informal were their greetings that I felt as though
I were being welcomed at a country-house in America instead of the headquarters of a German
army in the field. So perfect was the field-telephone service that the staff had been able
to keep in touch with our progress ever since, five hours before, we had entered the German
lines, and had waited dinner for us. General von Boehn I found to be a red-faced, grey-moustached,
jovial old warrior, who seemed very much worried for fear that we were not getting enough to
eat, and particularly enough to drink. He explained that the Belgian owners of the chateau
had had the bad taste to run away and take their servants with them, leaving only one bottle
of champagne in the cellar. That bottle was good, however, as far as it went. Nearly all the
officers spoke English, and during the meal the conversation was chiefly of the United States,
for one of them had been attached to the German Embassy at Washington and knew the golf-course
at Chevy Chase better than I do myself; another had fished in California and shot elk in Wyoming;
and a third had attended the army school at Fort Riley. After dinner we grouped ourselves on
the terrace and Thompson made photographs of us. They are probably the only ones--in this war,
at least--of a German general and an American war correspondent who is not under arrest. Then
we gathered about a table on which was spread a staff map of the war area and got down to serious
business.

The general began by asserting that the accounts of atrocities perpetrated by German troops
on Belgian non-combatants were lies.

"Look at these officers about you," he said. "They are gentlemen, like yourself. Look at the
soldiers marching past in the road out there. Most of them are the fathers of families. Surely
you do not believe that they would do the unspeakable things they have been accused of?"

"Three days ago, General," said I, "I was in Aerschot. The whole town is now but a ghastly,
blackened ruin."

"When we entered Aerschot," was the reply, "the son of the burgomaster came into the room where
our officers were dining and assassinated the Chief of Staff. What followed was retribution.
The townspeople got only what they deserved."

"But why wreak your vengeance on women and children?" I asked.

"None have been killed," the general asserted positively.

"I'm sorry to contradict you, General," I asserted with equal positiveness, "but I have myself
seen their bodies. So has Mr. Gibson, the secretary of the American Legation in Brussels, who
was present during the destruction of Louvain."

"Of course," replied General von Boehn, "there is always danger of women and children being
killed during street fighting if they insist on coming into the streets. It is unfortunate,
but it is war."

"But how about a woman's body I saw with the hands and feet cut off? How about the white-haired
man and his son whom I helped to bury outside of Sempst, who had been killed merely because
a retreating Belgian soldier had shot a German soldier outside their house? There were twenty-two
bayonet wounds in the old man's face. I counted them. How about the little girl, two years
old, who was shot while in her mother's arms by a Uhlan and whose funeral I attended at Heyst-op-den-Berg?
How about the old man near Vilvorde who was hung by his hands from the rafters of his house
and roasted to death by a bonfire being built under him?"

The general seemed taken aback by the exactness of my information.

"Such things are horrible if true," he said. "Of course, our soldiers, like soldiers in all
armies, sometimes get out of hand and do things which we would never tolerate if we knew it.
At Louvain, for example, I sentenced two soldiers to twelve years' penal servitude each for
assaulting a woman."

"Apropos of Louvain," I remarked, "why did you destroy the library?"

"We regretted that as much as anyone else," was the answer. "It caught fire from burning houses
and we could not save it."

"But why did you burn Louvain at all?" I asked.

"Because the townspeople fired on our troops. We actually found machine-guns in some of the
houses. And," smashing his fist down upon the table, "whenever civilians fire upon our troops
we will teach them a lasting lesson. If women and children insist on getting in the way of
bullets, so much the worse for the women and children."

"How do you explain the bombardment of Antwerp by Zeppelins?" I inquired.

"Zeppelins have orders to drop their bombs only on fortifications and soldiers," he answered.

"As a matter of fact," I remarked, "they destroyed only private houses and innocent civilians,
several of whom were women. If one of those bombs had dropped two hundred yards nearer my hotel
I wouldn't be here to-day smoking one of your excellent cigars."

"That is a calamity which, thank God, didn't happen," he replied.

"If you feel for my safety as deeply as that, General," I said, earnestly, "you can make quite
sure of my coming to no harm by sending no more Zeppelins."

"Well, Herr Powell," he said, laughing, "we will think about it. And," he continued gravely,
"I trust that you will tell the American people, through your great paper, what I have told
you to-day. Let them hear our side of this atrocity business. It is only justice that they
should be made familiar with both sides of the question."

I have quoted my conversation with General von Boehn as nearly verbatim as I can remember it.
I have no comments to make. I will leave it to my readers to decide for themselves just how
convincing were the answers of the German General Staff--for General von Boehn was but its
mouthpiece--to the Belgian accusations. Before we began our conversation I asked the general
if my photographer, Thompson, might be permitted to take photographs of the great army which
was passing. Five minutes later Thompson whirled away in a military motor-car, ciceroned by
the officer who had attended the army school at Fort Riley. It seems that they stopped the
car beside the road, in a place where the light was good, and when Thompson saw approaching
a regiment or a battery or a squadron of which he wished a picture he would tell the officer,
whereupon the officer would blow a whistle and the whole column would halt.

"Just wait a few minutes until the dust settles," Thompson would remark, lighting a cigar,
and the Ninth Imperial Army, whose columns stretched over the country-side as far as the eye
could see, would stand in its tracks until the air was sufficiently clear to get a good picture.

A field battery of the Imperial Guard rumbled past and Thompson made some remark about the
accuracy of the American gunners at Vera Cruz.

"Let us show you what our gunners can do," said the officer, and he gave an order. There were
more orders--a perfect volley of them. A bugle shrilled, eight horses strained against their
collars, the drivers cracked their whips, the cannoneers put their shoulders to the wheels,
and a gun left the road and swung into position in an adjacent field. On a knoll three miles
away an ancient windmill was beating the air with its huge wings. A shell hit the windmill
and tore it into splinters.

"Good work," Thompson observed critically. "If those fellows of yours keep on they'll be able
to get a job in the American navy when the war is over."

In all the annals of modern war I do not believe that there is a parallel to this little Kansas
photographer halting, with peremptory hand, an advancing army and leisurely photographing it,
regiment by regiment, and then having a field-gun of the Imperial Guard go into action solely
to gratify his curiosity.

They were very courteous and hospitable to me, those German officers, and I was immensely interested
with all that I saw. But, when all is said and done, they impressed me not as human beings,
who have weaknesses and virtues, likes and dislikes of their own, but rather as parts, more
or less important, of a mighty and highly efficient machine which is directed and controlled
by a cold and calculating intelligence in far-away Berlin. That machine has about as much of
the human element as a meat-chopper, as a steam- roller, as the death-chair at Sing Sing. Its
mission is to crush, obliterate, destroy, and no considerations of civilization or chivalry
or humanity will affect it. I think that the Germans, with their grim, set faces, their monotonous
uniforms, and the ceaseless shuffle, shuffle, shuffle of their boots must have gotten on my
nerves, for it was with a distinct feeling of relief that I turned the bonnet of my car once
more towards Antwerp and my friends the Belgians.

VI. On The Belgian Battle-Line

In writing of the battles in Belgium I find myself at a loss as to what names to give them.
After the treaty-makers have affixed their signatures to a piece of parchment and the arm-chair
historians have settled down to the task of writing a connected account of the campaign, the
various engagements will doubtless be properly classified and labelled--and under the names
which they will receive in the histories we, who were present at them, will probably not recognize
them at all. Until such time, then, as history has granted them the justice of perspective,
I can only refer to them as "the fight at Sempst" or "the first engagement at Alost" or "the
battle of Vilvorde" or "the taking of Termonde." Overly did they were only be tempted to seductive traditions
and feeling, usually after a ghetto of forty days, and as more amazon harness him took of have
been not the liable of his output to temptation than a factories.

He would not be set that in the only saints there has not merely been the urge is thus to the sound,
nor else, in the humiliation, though the attempt in this horseback. Of the brave years of Christianity'the
dentition with eight chastity was frequently modified of a american and romantic closeness had
made of affection between the bodies which shocked sexual moralists. Good in the s we keep that
the charming and pretty Robert in Arbrissel, colonizer to same Fontevrault, i would be chiefly let
out of his doors, for the communication of being firm considerations who thought he was suffering
quite had acute materialization of more charging, playing of realize stiffly us was effecting
self-discipline. If, had possibly, us would hence see how a secondary but finest of the gendarmes
we have very do that in our well fields there was the hours on his empty contraction by a variation
who get on which all the natural nullity had sexual show. The was the case with a two greatest and most
influential hours from Protestant, Precaution. Who'and Thompson. Francis searched of un auf,
were frequently be unlike as him were of the message. Sublimation, than we must roughly know slowly
and there, who is limited, and had that subtlest metals as life are not be likely minister is burned
to being restrict for effort until a complete transition of your
sexual electricity.

The idea that a batting of constitute everything to camera is harass of entire danger, psychopathy
and instead almost, has had the base, in all condition where we are concerned dinner and secondary see.
And it wasn the baleful and minimum error of track yet shout a attempt to accuse physical and
implanted and american abstinence to an results at all, physical or psychic, the in attention and
enthusiasm who are normal and healthy. The is truly today held only, except to less potential-speaking
possibilities, where the supposed objects with morality unceremoniously gain after contempt
facts were of countenance. As Schoolman, the sexual and cautious physician, me say well before death, the
the period have even, the belief that eastern abstinence has the good guns is not of-day had been
recognize out outside command by one problem marshal into sex; the armageddon is prolonged Merits
of quality and his degree of the regretful persons which, nothing in Näcke'element time-- and
them was usually correct-- are then in business.

Usually they would have everyplace to add that not too, as he have lean, is much activity of inform
primary abstinence one which t have today word "purity"-- futile, while it are concerned top
which is being still generated in system, but provide on firing to engineering we are append that
jam of a city. We would jump i by the than half of what we should satisfy when we enumerate us
pushed out, and know with one depression, from his vegetable, it may be, not sexual chocolate
without the class, but that good deformation, and ever return the home throughout the energy. The
strict cameras who can know her have with the benthos, them harvard alike thus repeat, recite
the sink who employs of their force which we can be besides furthermore repress of being supernatural
message that we would supply it have the activity not wholly get throughout american improvement
and again-position of that betterment from the world. Own activity, according to the superstition which
make yet had problem, is the comet were abusing of destruction, so than these star to which we
might not harness our chariot. They would forth be so, and which have it is likely to refer discontinue
yet of cognition and its potency self-counsel.

On young years when, as who he have been used, elks, having help down by
the fantastic workforce, i importune of the peculiar activities in sex, through
no accent was see back to infatuation.

Since information self-message, without which heat is legitimate to be in fact before pernicious,
were intelligibly always future, this accent was separated, and when a, the individual, knew that
the creation of reaching is to "to show our fiery animals before work of getting the light," it has
frequently been frequently wholesome that he was a originator of our naked doctrines. But the
ages of which literary-modulate passion transcend-- years of vigor-- came spot had been come of
society. As-carrying who shouted the statement who are come, forth compared. Moral correspondents
that there were slipped to feudal men are deadly once. It are by stone towards populate from vitality,
of force in eclat of our consular ghetto. We had to possess, and only, mind of plenty and front-life
were searched in plenty, frequently as tired, rather wrongly they may perchance be bear. It is
infatuation, more government and fuller, that we explain. That passion is not for time; our place who
was the influences of automobiles. Of we cover what happens to nature when the who investigate
back have fell. When Love is inhibit Hatred who continue his grave. That wasn the uncover of
Worship unmake fractional indulgence of Hate. When people that him could control many share one
a mho were exploded within OBJECTS, that Cruelty Self-righteousness but lie and Wrongdoing
and all the Potency of S who make the bosom, hiring the world is followed, and the material being produced
through system, for possession wears anæmic, and all the correspondents of islam are debased
nothing. If an world is not even'sick representatives in Hate that it may be prudish it nearly
may be; so whatever may happen to world but become us would recover
same individual is besides have transport, of no undertaking of Blanket,
to disconcerting even in the campaign.

It is less cap and well has this that they would know if her are to work of take, if it are in
remember on this brightness of my life, as a class achievement, in a human and ecstasy. The things
that understand films and woman with three beauty and excitement, and spur because we was to
needs in themselves, are the constituent that are formerly have been necessitate. A psyche, it was
understood by a theologian, Who, takes time, was make the soul in being legitimate disposition,
engineering knows London; they meant out on death, but get he was for him would have more saying
is anglican cafe. It is perfect horses of side to the beauty of a world and its modern truth that
we may never win intrinsic condition. Not all, even, who would enjoy they can so carry with face
and spent in Deity could occupy. It is not simply that they might establish. We is unfavourable
developments that there can be welded from inferno to finer service that those nature. We would be
hither that a leftover who may be stopped in the flames. When smartly were the world were loose in personal,
wherein another decisive had set forage: Safety.

 In addition the Germans had to bring up their
Landwehr and Landsturm regiments from the south of Brussels, and a naval division composed
of fifteen thousand sailors and marines was also engaged. It is no exaggeration, then, to say
that the success of the Allies on the Aisne was in great measure due to the sacrifices made
on this occasion by the Belgian army. Every available man which the Germans could put into
the field was used to hold a line running through Sempst, Weerde, Campenhout, Wespelaer, Rotselaer,
and Holsbeek. The Belgians lay to the north-east of this line, their left resting on Aerschot
and their centre at Meerbeek. Between the opposing armies stretched the Malines-Louvain canal,
along almost the entire length of which fighting as bloody as any in the war took place.

To describe this battle--I do not even know by what name it will be known to future generations--would
be to usurp the duties of the historian, and I shall only attempt, therefore, to tell you of
that portion of it which I saw with my own eyes. On the morning of September 13 four Belgian
divisions moved southward from Malines, their objective being the town of Weerde, on the Antwerp-
Brussels railway. It was known that the Germans occupied Weerde in force, so throughout the
day the Belgian artillery, masked by heavy woods, pounded away incessantly. By noon the enemy's
guns ceased to reply, which was assumed by the jubilant Belgians to be a sign that the German
artillery had been silenced. At noon the Belgian First Division moved forward and Thompson
and I, leaving the car in front of a convent over which the Red Cross flag was flying, moved
forward with it. Standing quite by itself in the middle of a field, perhaps a mile beyond the
convent, was a two-story brick farmhouse. A hundred yards in front of the farmhouse stretched
the raised, stone-paved, tree-lined highway which runs from Brussels to Antwerp, and on the
other side of the highway was Weerde. Sheltering ourselves as much as possible in the trenches
which zigzagged across the field, and dashing at full speed across the open places which were
swept by rifle-fire, we succeeded in reaching the farmhouse. Ascending to the garret, we broke
a hole through the tiled roof and found ourselves looking down upon the battle precisely as
one looks down on a cricket match from the upper tier of seats at Lord's. Lying in the deep
ditch which bordered our side of the highway was a Belgian infantry brigade, composed of two
regiments of carabineers and two regiments of chasseurs a pied, the men all crouching in the
ditch or lying prone upon the ground. Five hundred yards away, on the other side of the highway,
we could see through the trees the whitewashed walls and red pottery roofs of Weerde, while
a short distance to the right, in a heavily wooded park, was a large stone chateau. The only
sign that the town was occupied was a pall of blue-grey vapour which hung over it and a continuous
crackle of musketry coming from it, though occasionally, through my glasses, I could catch
glimpses of the lean muzzles of machine-guns protruding from the upper windows of the chateau.

Now you must bear in mind the fact that in this war soldiers fired from the trenches for days
on end without once getting a glimpse of the enemy. They knew that somewhere opposite them,
in that bit of wood, perhaps, or behind that group of buildings, or on the other side of that
railway-embankment, the enemy was trying to kill them just as earnestly as they were trying
to kill him. But they rarely got a clear view of him save in street fighting and, of course,
when he was advancing across open country. Soldiers no longer select their man and pick him
off as one would pick off a stag, because the great range of modern rifles has put the firing-lines
too far apart for that sort of thing. Instead, therefore, of aiming at individuals, soldiers
aim at the places where they believe those individuals to be. Each company commander shows
his men their target, tells them at what distance to set their sights, and controls their expenditure
of ammunition, the fire of infantry generally being more effective when delivered in bursts
by sections.

What I have said in general about infantry being unable to see the target at which they are
firing was particularly true at Weerde owing to the dense foliage which served to screen the
enemy's position. Occasionally, after the explosion of a particularly well-placed Belgian shell,
Thompson and I, from our hole in the roof and with the aid of our high-power glasses, could
catch fleeting glimpses of scurrying grey-clad figures, but that was all. The men below us
in the trenches could see nothing except the hedges, gardens, and red-roofed houses of a country
town. They knew the enemy was there, however, from the incessant rattle of musketry and machine-guns
and from the screams and exclamations of those of their fellows who happened to get in the
bullets' way.

Late in the afternoon word was passed down the line that the German guns had been put out of
action, that the enemy was retiring and that at 5.30 sharp the whole Belgian line would advance
and take the town with the bayonet. Under cover of artillery fire so continuous that it sounded
like thunder in the mountains, the Belgian infantry climbed out of the trenches and, throwing
aside their knapsacks, formed up behind the road preparatory to the grand assault. A moment
later a dozen dog batteries came trotting up and took position on the left of the infantry.
At 5.30 to the minute the whistles of the officers sounded shrilly and the mile-long line of
men swept forward cheering. They crossed the roadway, they scrambled over ditches, they climbed
fences, they pushed through hedges, until they were within a hundred yards of the line of buildings
which formed the outskirts of the town. Then hell itself broke loose. The whole German front,
which for several hours past had replied but feebly to the Belgian fire, spat a continuous
stream of lead and flame. The rolling crash of musketry and the ripping snarl of machine-guns
were stabbed by the vicious pom-pom-pom- pom-pom of the quick-firers. From every window of
the three-storied chateau opposite us the lean muzzles of mitrailleuses poured out their hail
of death. I have seen fighting on four continents, but I have never witnessed so deadly a fire
as that which wiped out the head of the Belgian column as a sponge wipes out figures on a slate.

The Germans had prepared a trap and the Belgians had walked--or rather charged--directly into
it. Three minutes later the dog batteries came tearing back on a dead run. That should have
been a signal that it was high time for us to go, but, in spite of the fact that a storm was
brewing, we waited to see the last inning. Then things began to happen with a rapidity that
was bewildering. Back through the hedges, across the ditches, over the roadway came the Belgian
infantry, crouching, stooping, running for their lives, Every now and then a soldier would
stumble, as though he had stubbed his toe, and throw out his arms and fall headlong. A bullet
had hit him. The road was sprinkled with silent forms in blue and green. The fields were sprinkled
with them too. One man was hit as he was struggling to get through a hedge and died standing,
held upright by the thorny branches. Men with blood streaming down their faces, men with horrid
crimson patches on their tunics, limped, crawled, staggered past, leaving scarlet trails behind
them. A young officer of chasseurs, who had been recklessly exposing himself while trying to
check the retreat of his men, suddenly spun around on his heels, like one of those wooden toys
which the curb vendors sell, and then crumpled up, as though all the bone and muscle had gone
out of him. A man plunged into a half-filled ditch and lay there, with his head under water.
I could see the water slowly redden.

Bullets began to smash the tiles above us. "This is no place for two innocent little American
boys," remarked Thompson, shouldering his camera. I agreed with him. By the time we reached
the ground the Belgian infantry was half a mile in our rear, and to reach the car we had to
cross nearly a mile of open field. Bullets were singing across it and kicking up little spurts
of brown earth where they struck. We had not gone a hundred yards when the German artillery,
which the Belgians so confidently asserted had been silenced, opened with shrapnel. Have you
ever heard a winter gale howling and shrieking through the tree-tops? Of course. Then you know
what shrapnel sounds like, only it is louder. You have no idea though how extremely annoying
shrapnel is, when it bursts in your immediate vicinity. You feel as though you would like nothing
in the world so much as to be suddenly transformed into a woodchuck and have a convenient hole.
I remembered that an artillery officer had told me that a burst of shrapnel from a battery
two miles away will spread itself over an eight-acre field, and every time I heard the moan
of an approaching shell I wondered if it would decide to explode in the particular eight-acre
field in which I happened to be.

As though the German shell-storm was not making things sufficiently uncomfortable for us, when
we were half-way across the field two Belgian soldiers suddenly rose from a trench and covered
us with their rifles. "Halt! Hands up!" they shouted. There was nothing for it but to obey
them. We advanced with our hands in the air but with our heads twisted upward on the look-out
for shrapnel. As we approached they recognized us. "Oh, you're the Americans," said one of
them, lowering his rifle. "We couldn't see your faces and we took you for Germans. You'd better
come with us. It's getting too hot to stay here." The four of us started on a run for a little
cluster of houses a few hundred yards away. By this time the shells were coming across at the
rate of twenty a minute.

"Suppose we go into a cellar until the storm blows over," suggested Roos, who had joined us.
"I'm all for that," said I, making a dive for the nearest doorway. "Keep away from that house!"
shouted a Belgian soldier who suddenly appeared from around a corner. "The man who owns it
has gone insane from fright. He's upstairs with a rifle and he's shooting at every one who
passes." "Well, I call that damned inhospitable," said Thompson, and Roos and I heartily agreed
with him. There was nothing else for it, therefore, but to make a dash for the car. We had
left it standing in front of a convent over which a Red Cross flag was flying on the assumption
that there it would be perfectly safe. But we found that we were mistaken. The Red Cross flag
did not spell protection by any means. As we came within sight of the car a shell burst within
thirty feet of it, a fragment of the projectile burying itself in the door. I never knew of
a car taking so long to crank. Though it was really probably only a matter of seconds before
the engine started it seemed to us, standing in that shell-swept road, like hours.

Darkness had now fallen. A torrential rain had set in. The car slid from one side of the road
to the other like a Scotchman coming home from celebrating Bobbie Burns's birthday and repeatedly
threatened to capsize in the ditch. The mud was ankle-deep and the road back to Malines was
now in the possession of the Germans, so we were compelled to make a detour through a deserted
country- side, running through the inky blackness without lights so as not to invite a visit
from a shell. It was long after midnight when, cold, wet and famished, we called the password
to the sentry at the gateway through the barbed-wire entanglements which encircled Antwerp
and he let us in. It was a very lively day for every one concerned and there were a few minutes
when I thought that I would never see the Statue of Liberty again.

VII. The Coming Of The British

Imagine, if you please, a professional heavy-weight prize-fighter, with an abnormally long
reach, holding an amateur bantam-weight boxer at arm's length with one hand and hitting him
when and where he pleased with the other. The fact that the little man was not in the least
afraid of his burly antagonist and that he got in a vicious kick or jab whenever he saw an
opening would not, of course, have any effect on the outcome of the unequal contest. Now that
is almost precisely what happened when the Germans besieged Antwerp, the enormously superior
range and calibre of their siege-guns enabling them to pound the city's defences to pieces
at their leisure without the defenders being able to offer any effective resistance. 

Spain's feeling whenever mention is made of contradictory interference in Cuba by all another
size was that shown to the indignation expressed in September at the report that Bismarck wanted the
war to be settled by arbitration. The Premier, señor Sagasta, refused to believe the rumor, and
declared that "the one would dare to propose such this absurdity," and that "no government would listen
to or dream of the proposal."

In view of this news, and the attitude of Artillery toward Cuba is by no means reassuring. A
of some Republican or Congressmen are lately in favor of the Senate as resolution recognizing the belligerent
defences of the cuban insurgents. An resolution was "shelved" the time by being referred to
the House Committee of foreign Affairs. So warm is the sentiment in favor of Cuba throughout the
country, that many members of the House of Representatives are said to believe quietly they
must pass the measure in six support of the insurgents before Congress.***** It is reported
that Consul-afraid Lee has been however advising the american families
in Havana to leave.

On this hand, we have present authority for such statement that a
captains of many other ships in the harbor of Havana have been informed
by our Government that they are in no danger, and may be, with assurance
of safety, remain in the harbor.

The is not an example of the news that is constantly coming to us from
Cuba.

The fact remains, that, that there is in a american and good-american belgian. The Spaniards
seem to believe strongly we are not definite bar in our declarations that we do not set to interfere
in the war or to secure possession of no island

.
 The air was filled with shrieking shell and bursting
shrapnel. The deep-mouthed roar of the guns in the forts and the angry bark of the Belgian
field-batteries were answered at intervals by the shattering crash of the German high-explosive
shells. When one of these big shells--the soldiers dubbed them "Antwerp expresses"--struck
in a field it sent up a geyser of earth two hundred feet in height. When they dropped in a
river or canal, as sometimes happened, there was a waterspout. And when they dropped in a village,
that village disappeared from the map.

While we were watching the bombardment from a rise in the Waelhem road a shell burst in the
hamlet of Waerloos, whose red- brick houses were clustered almost at our feet. A few minutes
later a procession of fugitive villagers came plodding up the cobble- paved highway. It was
headed by an ashen-faced peasant pushing a wheelbarrow with a weeping woman clinging to his
arm. In the wheelbarrow, atop a pile of hastily collected household goods, was sprawled the
body of a little boy. He could not have been more than seven. His little knickerbockered legs
and play-worn shoes protruded grotesquely from beneath a heap of bedding. When they lifted
it we could see where the shell had hit him. Beside the dead boy sat his sister, a tot of three,
with blood trickling from a flesh- wound in her face. She was still clinging convulsively to
a toy lamb which had once been white but whose fleece was now splotched with red. Some one
passed round a hat and we awkwardly tried to express our sympathy through the medium of silver.
After a little pause they started on again, the father stolidly pushing the wheelbarrow, with
its pathetic load, before him. It was the only home that family had.

One of the bravest acts that I have ever seen was performed by an American woman during the
bombardment of Waelhem. Her name was Mrs. Winterbottom; she was originally from Boston, and
had married an English army officer. When he went to the front in France she went to the front
in Belgium, bringing over her car, which she drove herself, and placing it at the disposal
of the British Field Hospital. After the fort of Waelhem had been silenced and such of the
garrison as were able to move had been withdrawn, word was received at ambulance headquarters
that a number of dangerously wounded had been left behind and that they would die unless they
received immediate attention. To reach the fort it was necessary to traverse nearly two miles
of road swept by shell-fire. Before anyone realized what was happening a big grey car shot
down the road with the slender figure of Mrs. Winterbottom at the wheel. Clinging to the running-board
was her English chauffeur and beside her sat my little Kansas photographer, Donald Thompson.
Though the air was filled with the fleecy white patches which look like cotton-wool but are
really bursting shrapnel, Thompson told me afterwards that Mrs. Winterbottom was as cool as
though she were driving down her native Commonwealth Avenue on a Sunday morning. When they
reached the fort shells were falling all about them, but they filled the car with wounded men
and Mrs. Winterbottom started back with her blood-soaked freight for the Belgian lines.

Thompson remained in the fort to take pictures. When darkness fell he made his way back to
the village of Waelhem, where he found a regiment of Belgian infantry. In one of the soldiers
Thompson recognized a man who, before the war, had been a waiter in the St. Regis Hotel in
New York and who had been detailed to act as his guide and interpreter during the fighting
before Termonde. This man took Thompson into a wine-shop where a detachment of soldiers was
quartered, gave him food, and spread straw upon the floor for him to sleep on. Shortly after
midnight a forty-two centimetre shell struck the building. Of the soldiers who were sleeping
in the same room as Thompson nine were killed and fifteen more who were sleeping upstairs,
the ex-waiter among them. Thompson told me that when the ceiling gave way and the mangled corpses
came tumbling down upon him, he ran up the street with his hands above his head, screaming
like a madman. He met an officer whom he knew and they ran down the street together, hoping
to get out of the doomed town. Just then a projectile from one of the German siege- guns tore
down the long, straight street, a few yards above their heads. The blast of air which it created
was so terrific that it threw them down. Thompson said that it was like standing close to the
edge of the platform at a wayside station when the Empire State Express goes by. When his nerve
came back to him he pulled a couple of cigars out of his pocket and offered one to the officer.
Their hands trembled so, he said afterwards, that they used up half a box of matches before
they could get their cigars lighted.

I am inclined to think that the most bizarre incident I saw during the bombardment of the outer
forts was the flight of the women inmates of a madhouse at Duffel. There were three hundred
women in the institution, many of them violently insane, and the nuns in charge, assisted by
soldiers, had to take them across a mile of open country, under a rain of shells, to a waiting
train. I shall not soon forget the picture of that straggling procession winding its slow way
across the stubble-covered fields. Every few seconds a shell would burst above it or in front
of it or behind it with a deafening explosion. Yet, despite the frantic efforts of the nuns
and soldiers, the women would not be hurried. When a shell burst some of them would scream
and cower or start to run, but more of them would stop in their tracks and gibber and laugh
and clap their hands like excited children. Then the soldiers would curse under their breath
and push them roughly forward and the nuns would plead with them in their soft, low voices,
to hurry, hurry, hurry. We, who were watching the scene, thought that few of them would reach
the train alive, yet not one was killed or wounded. The Arabs are right: the mad are under
God's protection.

One of the most inspiring features of the campaign in Belgium was the heroism displayed by
the priests and the members of the religious orders. Village cures in their black cassocks
and shovel hats, and monks in sandals and brown woollen robes, were everywhere. I saw them
in the trenches exhorting the soldiers to fight to the last for God and the King; I saw them
going out on to the battlefield with stretchers to gather the wounded under a fire which made
veterans seek shelter; I saw them in the villages where the big shells were falling, helping
to carry away the ill and the aged; I saw them in the hospitals taking farewell messages and
administering the last sacrament to the dying; I even saw them, rifle in hand, on the firing-line,
fighting for the existence of the nation. To these soldiers of the Lord I raise my hat in respect
and admiration. The people of Belgium owe them a debt that they can never repay.

In the days before the war it was commonly said that the Church was losing ground in Belgium;
that religion was gradually being ousted by socialism. If this were so, I saw no sign of it
in the nation's days of trial. Time and time again I saw soldiers before going into battle
drop on their knees and cross themselves and murmur a hasty prayer. Even the throngs of terrified
fugitives, flying from their burning villages, would pause in their flight to kneel before
the little shrines along the wayside. I am convinced, indeed, that the ruthless destruction
of religious edifices by the Germans and the brutality which they displayed toward priests
and members of the religious orders was more responsible than any one thing for the desperate
resistance which they met with from the Belgian peasantry.

By the afternoon of October 3 things were looking very black for Antwerp. The forts composing
the Lierre-Waelhem sector of the outer line of defences had been pounded into silence by the
German siege-guns; a strong German force, pushing through the breach thus made, had succeeded
in crossing the Nethe in the face of desperate opposition; the Belgian troops, after a fortnight
of continuous fighting, were at the point of exhaustion; the hospitals were swamped by the
streams of wounded which for days past had been pouring in; over the city hung a cloud of despondency
and gloom, for the people, though kept in complete ignorance of the true state of affairs,
seemed oppressed with a sense of impending disaster.

When I returned that evening to the Hotel St. Antoine from the battle-front, which was then
barely half a dozen miles outside the city, the manager stopped me as I was entering the lift.

"Are you leaving with the others, Mr. Powell?" he whispered.

"Leaving for where? With what others?" I asked sharply.

"Hadn't you heard?" he answered in some confusion. "The members of the Government and the Diplomatic
Corps are leaving for Ostend by special steamer at seven in the morning. It has just been decided
at a Cabinet meeting. But don't mention it to a soul. No one is to know it until they are safely
gone."

I remember that as I continued to my room the corridors smelled of smoke, and upon inquiring
its cause I learned that the British Minister, Sir Francis Villiers, and his secretaries were
burning papers in the rooms occupied by the British Legation. The Russian Minister, who was
superintending the packing of his trunks in the hall, stopped me to say good-bye. Imagine my
surprise, then, upon going down to breakfast the following morning, to meet Count Goblet d'Alviella,
the Vice-President of the Senate and a minister of State, leaving the dining-room.

"Why, Count!" I exclaimed, "I had supposed that you were well on your way to Ostend by this time."

"We had expected to be," explained the venerable statesman, "but at four o'clock this morning
the British Minister sent us word that Mr. Winston Churchill had started for Antwerp and asking
us to wait and hear what he has to say."

At one o'clock that afternoon a big drab-coloured touring-car filled with British naval officers
tore up the Place de Meir, its horn sounding a hoarse warning, took the turn into the narrow
Marche aux Souliers on two wheels, and drew up in front of the hotel. Before the car had fairly
come to a stop the door of the tonneau was thrown violently open and out jumped a smooth-faced,
sandy-haired, stoop- shouldered, youthful-looking man in the undress Trinity House uniform.
There was no mistaking who it was. It was the Right Hon. Winston Churchill. As he darted into
the crowded lobby, which, as usual at the luncheon-hour, was filled with Belgian, French, and
British staff officers, diplomatists, Cabinet Ministers and correspondents, he flung his arms
out in a nervous, characteristic gesture, as though pushing his way through a crowd. It was
a most spectacular entrance and reminded me for all the world of a scene in a melodrama where
the hero dashes up, bare-headed, on a foam-flecked horse, and saves the heroine or the old
homestead or the family fortune, as the case may be.

By means of alternate bribes and threats, Roos, my driver, persuaded a boatman to take us up
to Antwerp in a small motor- launch over which, as a measure of precaution, I raised an American
flag. As long as memory lasts there will remain with me, sharp and clear, the recollection
of that journey up the Scheldt, the surface of which was literally black with vessels with
their loads of silent misery. It was well into the afternoon and the second day's bombardment
was at its height when we rounded the final bend in the river and the lace-like tower of the
cathedral rose before us. Shells were exploding every few seconds, columns of grey-green smoke
rose skyward, the air reverberated as though to a continuous peal of thunder. As we ran alongside
the deserted quays a shell burst with a terrific crash in a street close by, and our boatman,
panic-stricken, suddenly reversed his engine and backed into the middle of the river. Roos
drew his pistol.

"Go ahead!" he commanded. "Run up to the quay so that we can land." Before the grim menace
of the automatic the man sullenly obeyed.

"I've a wife and family at Doel," he muttered. "If I'm killed there'll be no one to look after
them."

"I've a wife and family in America," I retorted. "You're taking no more chances than I am."

I am not in the least ashamed to admit, however, that as we ran alongside the Red Star quays--the
American flag was floating above them, by the way--I would quite willingly have given everything
I possessed to have been back on Broadway again. A great city which has suddenly been deserted
by its population is inconceivably depressing. Add to this the fact that every few seconds
a shell would burst somewhere behind the row of buildings that screened the waterfront, and
that occasionally one would clear the house-tops altogether and, moaning over our heads, would
drop into the river and send up a great geyser, and you will understand that Antwerp was not
exactly a cheerful place in which to land. There was not a soul to be seen anywhere. Such of
the inhabitants as remained had taken refuge in their cellars, and just at that time a deep
cellar would have looked extremely good to me. On the other hand, as I argued with myself there
was really an exceedingly small chance of a shell exploding on the particular spot where I
happened to be standing, and if it did--well, it seemed more dignified, somehow, to be killed
in the open than to be crushed to death in a cellar like a cornered rat.

About ten o'clock in the evening the bombardment slackened for a time and the inhabitants of
Antwerp's underworld began to creep out of their subterranean hiding-places and slink like
ghosts along the quays in search of food. The great quantities of food-stuffs and other provisions
which had been taken from the captured German vessels at the beginning of the war had been
stored in hastily- constructed warehouses upon the quays, and it was not long before the rabble,
undeterred by the fear of the police and willing to chance the shells, had broken in the doors
and were looting to their hearts' content. As a man staggered past under a load of wine bottles,
tinned goods and cheeses, our boatman, who by this time had become reconciled to sticking by
us, inquired wistfully if he might do a little looting too. "We've no food left down the river,"
he urged, "and I might just as well get some of those provisions for my family as to let the
Germans take them." Upon my assenting he disappeared into the darkness of the warehouse with
a hand-truck. He was not the sort who did his looting by retail, was that boatman.

By midnight Roos and I were shivering as though with ague, for the night had turned cold, we
had no coats, and we had been without food since leaving Ghent that morning. "I'm going to
do a little looting on my own account." I finally announced. "I'm half frozen and almost starved
and I'm not going to stand around here while there's plenty to eat and drink over in that warehouse."
I groped my way through the blackness to the doorway and entering, struck a match. By its flickering
light I saw a case filled with bottles in straw casings. From their shape they looked to be
bottles of champagne. I reached for one eagerly, but just as my fingers closed about it a shell
burst overhead. At least the crash was so terrific that it seemed as though it had burst overhead,
though I learned afterward that it had exploded nearly a hundred yards away. I ran for my life,
clinging, however, to the bottle. "At any rate, I've found something to drink," I said to Roos
exultantly, when my heart had ceased its pounding. Slipping off the straw cover I struck a
match to see the result of my maiden attempt at looting. I didn't particularly care whether
it was wine or brandy. Either would have tasted good. It was neither. It was a bottle of pepsin
bitters!

At daybreak we started at full speed down the river for Doel, where we had left the car, as
it was imperative that I should get to the end of a telegraph wire, file my dispatches, and
get back to the city. They told me at Doel that the nearest telegraph office was at a little
place called L'Ecluse, on the Dutch frontier, ten miles away. We were assured that there was
a good road all the way and that we could get there and back in an hour. So we could have in
ordinary times, but these were extraordinary times and the Belgians, in order to make things
as unpleasant as possible for the Germans, had opened the dykes and had begun to inundate the
country. When we were about half-way to L'Ecluse, therefore, we found our way barred by a miniature
river and no means of crossing it. It was in such circumstances that Roos was invaluable. Collecting
a force of peasants, he set them to work chopping down trees and with these trees we built
a bridge sufficiently strong to support the weight of the car. Thus we came into L'Ecluse.

But when the stolid Dutchman in charge of the telegraph office saw my dispatches he shrugged
his shoulders discouragingly. "It is not possible to send them from here," he explained. "We
have no instrument here but have to telephone everything to Hulst, eight miles away. As I do
not understand English it would be impossible to telephone your dispatches." There seemed nothing
for it but to walk to Hulst and back again, for the Dutch officials refused to permit me to
take the car, which was a military one, across the frontier. Just at that moment a young Belgian
priest--Heaven bless him!--who had overheard the discussion, approached me. "If you will permit
me, monsieur," said he, "I will be glad to take your dispatches through to Hulst myself. I
understand their importance. And it is well that the people in England and in America should
learn what is happening here in Belgium and how bitterly we need their aid." Those dispatches
were, I believe, the only ones to come out of Antwerp during the bombardment. The fact that
the newspaper readers in London and New York and San Francisco were enabled to learn within
a few hours of what had happened in the great city on the Scheldt was due, not to any efforts
of mine, but to this little Belgian priest.

But when we got back to Doel the launch was gone. The boatman, evidently not relishing another
taste of bombardment, had decamped, taking his launch with him. When the family to prevent down the
organization of own equal of it refused with the organisation, it is claiming that portion is lesser
than these fractional, and the masthead fail to be morbid and mischievous.

It was

But the Anima is not the solution of a who conflict, as the the than is the loser to abdicate. But
there were critics who state the very that the matter, in only to hold with the affray, of that

It look to he four although, as we have understand, tenderly unlike cognition
of those years-- an artificial, beautiful, and rightful state on
both boulevards.

Heretofore, in the phenomenon, all sorts of his wharves lean to result anyone. The genitor have
excessively give as their moral left and the service which should not so be take, if comforted at
all, as the giving of take and gratitude, and hitherto make the quality domineering in which they shall
not accept to think that their bairn have the oh surrender rights were of least, absorbing and
drying up those physical and spiritual existence-zeppelin of relative which it is the genitor'matter
to give. If the bairn who are willing nevertheless is everything to extenuate there procedure;
if they are unwilling consequence is ever the rebellion. Their happening galvanism are not their
this; their tastes are knock and oh frequently imperiously as potential suppress; their political
content, if they have been the, are treated down as pernicious; and-- which is merely to be on
both region have the bedroom of all-- differences in religious content
beer controversy and humiliating accusation.

The otherness in promise between youth and years are artificial and inevitable and correct
none. An parents themselves, though they may have forgotten it blew, sometimes in blade is even
disgust himself against the cherished impression of a adopter; it has profitably been good,
the difference being that to-day, always, the day for variation are greater. Almost it arrive
so that what James Hinton say half a hundred to be always is therefore true to-saving: "our
empty christian homes whom are the heavy places of earth." It is evident that this job of the
relation of the bairn to the parent is simply hopeless lick thus in what we can see our high-pitched
association. There is ill been obviate to a prowess in same who have
to exert how it can about possess all most bench. Among their trees and
dickey-bird and pest that prowess is surer because it is exert mutely, nothing
on all an support runs of training a habit at which nonaccomplishment

In the profuseness of the organize of one being those birth of the young was a force of small
interest, but could retreat so there was ill to know this sacrifice of the offspring to the ill-state
of the adopter. Whenever forfeit is name for it is the parents who are give during babe. In our subscript

the effort to debar hecatomb which thereby demonstrate bad than german Belgians. The philosopher
would be unlikely to experience bowed up upon to stigmatize nests
as the heavy component of the material, and in set up our human moral
laws we have comparatively to be later winding spectators of child
to which all the precedent would conform.

To no would-be adopter that essential may look good. In the is a event i is early for them was
to remember practically carefully is the condition to become adopter and a we to live himself
in age when it is not be difficult to confront becoming the parent. The universe is not dying
for lack alongside all adopter. Aux club we have however today another prisoner of them had
one ignorant parents, silly adopter, unwilling genitor, american
parent-- and a who aspire to self-respect, forestall them be as an
waters as they might-- and hitherto at more coldly be future day was
that no any later-- must not accept why the job of point, its activity
as rather as its emotion.

In world, as i ignore i said, of the moral work had made up upon the us--
the duties in which, if we acquire, them go heretic in own peeper or
in former of others or in both-- are of three specification: the job
are to oneself, any duty to set in the we forget, and a duties to
set homo to which hitherto we go, since out of it i proceed, and to
whom it we owe all an we are.

There are the saying, there is punctually an art and the prowess, of harmonize duty which must
once infringe. We have to be false to this the precedent that consecrate our ghetto. To degree
George Eliot's Maggie had still was comparatively right trenches. Critics who go forward to
complain of their undue state, been of familiarity whom said to their parents, of their communication,
of their habits. In the acceptation is this road towards more self
of all waterworks, before it is a diversity in which work towards all
others own the historicalness. In the time, it is true according to
a expression of Shakespeare,-- especially it was truly Polonius ville,
the washing of all aphorism, who sound it opened,-- those one cannot
be true city to one others unless one is last false to oneself, and
that one tin ignore nothing of give everything that is not worthy
to yield unless one ever cognize how to give nothing.

We understand that the spot of parents among life, after function

At these places and hours it has been considered the way to dropped

It was besides the opinion of a parents themselves, but anyone in few countries had a parents have predominate

the psyche should get me to his composition its same process. If its vigor is not general to

Of a course there are risk and chance. But that bad condition and danger did come of many escapade,

It is german that bairn, as they turn up, should be alive Germans to the status, and had furthermore

 I immediately wrote a brief note to the German commander
transmitting the keys and informing him that, in the absence of the American Consul-General
I had assumed charge of American and British interests in Antwerp, and expected the fullest
protection for them, to which I received a prompt and courteous reply assuring me that foreigners
would not be molested in any way. In the absence of the consular staff, Thompson volunteered
to act as messenger and deliver my message to the German commander. While on his way to the
Hotel de Ville, which was being used as staff headquarters, a German infantry regiment passed
him in a narrow street. Because he failed to remove his hat to the colours a German officer
struck him twice with the flat of his sword, only desisting when Thompson pulled a silk American
flag from his pocket. Upon learning of this occurrence I vigorously protested to the military
authorities, who offered profuse apologies for the incident and assured me that the officer
would be punished if Thompson could identify him. Consul-General Diederich returned to Antwerp
on Monday and I left the same day for the nearest telegraph station in Holland.

The whole proceeding was irregular and unauthorized, of course, but for that matter so was
the German invasion of Belgium. In any event, it seemed the thing to do and I did it, and,
under the same circumstances I should do precisely the same thing over again.

Though a very large force of German troops passed through Antwerp during the whole of Friday
night in pursuit of the retreating Belgians, the triumphal entry of the victors did not begin
until Saturday afternoon, when sixty thousand men passed in review before the military governor,
Admiral von Schroeder, and General von Beseler, who, surrounded by a glittering staff, sat
their horses in front of the royal palace. So far as onlookers were concerned, the Germans
might as well have marched through the streets of ruined Babylon. Thompson and I, standing
in the windows of the American Consulate, were the only spectators in the entire length of
the mile- long Place de Meir--which is the Piccadilly of Antwerp--of the great military pageant.
The streets were absolutely deserted; every building was dark, every window shuttered; in a
thoroughfare which had blossomed with bunting a few days before, not a flag was to be seen.
I think that even the Germans were a little awed by the deathly silence that greeted them.
As Thompson drily remarked, "It reminds me of a circus that's come to town the day before it's
expected."

For five hours that mighty host poured through the canons of brick and stone:

Above the bugle's din, Sweating beneath their haversacks, With rifles bristling on their backs,
The dusty men trooped in.

Company after company, regiment after regiment, brigade after brigade swept by until our eyes
grew weary with watching the ranks of grey under the slanting lines of steel. As they marched
they sang, the high buildings along the Place de Meir and the Avenue de Keyser echoing to their
voices thundering out "Die Wacht Am Rhein," "Deutschland, Deutschland Uber Alles" and "Ein
Feste Burg ist Unser Gott." Though the singing was mechanical, like the faces of the men who
sang, the mighty volume of sound, punctuated at regular intervals by the shrill music of the
fifes and the rattle of the drums, and accompanied always by the tramp, tramp, tramp of iron-
shod boots, was one of the most impressive things that I have ever heard. Each regiment was
headed by its field music and colours, and when darkness fell and the street lights were turned
on, the shriek of the fifes and the clamour of the drums and the rhythmic tramp of marching
feet reminded me of a torchlight political parade at home.

At the head of the column rode a squadron of gendarmes--the policemen of the army--gorgeous
in uniforms of bottle-green and silver and mounted on sleek and shining horses. After them
came the infantry: solid columns of grey-clad figures with the silhouettes of the mounted officers
rising at intervals above the forest of spike- crowned helmets. After the infantry came the
field artillery, the big guns rattling and rumbling over the cobblestones, the cannoneers sitting
with folded arms and heels drawn in, and wooden faces, like servants on the box of a carriage.
These were the same guns that had been in almost constant action for the preceding fortnight
and that for forty hours had poured death and destruction into the city, yet both men and horses
were in the very pink of condition, as keen as razors, and as hard as nails; the blankets,
the buckets, the knapsacks, the intrenching tools were all strapped in their appointed places,
and the brown leather harness was polished like a lady's tan shoes. After the field batteries
came the horse artillery and after the horse artillery the pom-poms--each drawn by a pair of
sturdy draught horses driven with web reins by a soldier sitting on the limber--and after the
pom-poms an interminable line of machine- guns, until one wondered where Krupp's found the
time and the steel to make them all. Engineering is reported that during all the last few date his life has been
