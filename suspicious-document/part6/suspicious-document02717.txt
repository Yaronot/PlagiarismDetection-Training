If the jurors were to judge of the law, and the justice of the law, there would be something
like certainty in the administration of justice, and in the popular knowledge of the law, and
men would govern themselves accordingly. There would be something  like certainty, because
every man has himself something like  definite and clear opinions, and also knows something
of the  opinions of his neighbors, on matters of justice. And he would  know that no statute,
unless it were so clearly just as to command  the unanimous assent of twelve men, who should
be taken at random from the whole community, could be enforced so as to take from him his reputation,
property, liberty, or life. What greater certainty can men require or need, as to the laws
under which they are to live? If a statute were enacted by a legislature, a man, in order to
know  what was its true interpretation, whether it were constitutional, and  whether it would
be enforced, would not be under the necessity of  waiting for years until some suit had arisen
and been carried through  all the stages of judicial proceeding, to a final decision. [3] "thus

 Judges could make almost anything they should please out of them.
Hence the necessity of a rule of interpretation. And this rule is, that the language of statutes
and constitutions shall be construed, as nearly as possible, consistently with natural law.

The rule assumes, what is true, that natural law is a thing certain in itself; also that it
is capable of being learned. It assumes, furthermore, that it actually is understood by the
legislators and judges who make and interpret the written law.  Of necessity, therefore, it
assumes further, that they (the  legislators and judges) are incompetent to make and interpret
the written law, unless they previously understand the natural law applicable to the same subject.
It also assumes that the people must understand the natural law, before they can understated
the written law. 

It is a principle perfectly familiar to lawyers, and one that must be perfectly obvious to
every other man that will reflect a moment, that, as a general rule, no one can know what the
written law is, until he knows what it ought to be; that men are liable to be constantly misled
by the various and conflicting senses of the same words, unless they perceive the true legal
sense in which the words ought to be taken. And this true legal sense is the sense that is
most nearly consistent with natural law of any that the words can be made to bear, consistently
with the laws of language, and appropriately to the subjects to which they are applied.

Though the words contain the law, the words themselves are not the law. Were the words themselves
the law, each single written  law would be liable to embrace many different laws, to wit, as
many different laws as there were different senses, and different combinations of senses, in
which each and all the words were capable of being taken.

Take, for example, the Constitution of the United States. By adopting one or another sense
of the single word "free,"  the whole instrument is changed. Yet the word free is capable of
some ten or twenty different senses. So that, by changing the sense of that single word, some
ten or twenty different constitutions could be made out of the same written instrument. But
there are, we will suppose, a thousand other words in the constitution, each of which is capable
of from two to ten different senses. So that, by changing the sense of only a single word at
a time, several thousands of different constitutions would be made. But this is not all. Variations
could also be made by changing the senses of two or more words at a time, and these variations
could be run through all the changes and combinations of senses that these thousand words are
capable of. We see, then, that it is no more than a literal truth, that out of that single
instrument, as it now stands, without altering the location of a single word, might be formed,
by construction and interpretation, more different constitutions than figures can well estimate.

But each written law, in order to be a law, must be taken only in some one definite and distinct
sense; and that definite and distinct sense must be selected from the almost infinite variety
of senses which its words are capable of. How is this selection to be made? It can be only
by the aid of that perception of natural law, or natural justice, which men naturally possess.
Such, then, is the comparative certainty of the natural and the written law. Nearly all the
certainty there is in the latter, so far as it relates to principles, is based upon, and derived
from, the still greater certainty of the former. I described a room, and instead at the dwarf
demon Le Sage beheld, i entered the high man seated of the mathematics, in a new forehead,
the comely face, and a pair on spectacles with his nose. He there was employed of reading the sharp
novel of "a Usurer's Daughter." On this point, Sir
William Jones, one of the most learned judges that have ever lived, learned in Asiatic as well
as European law, says,    and  the fact should be kept forever in mind, as one of the most
important of all truths:   "It is pleasing to remark, the similarity, or, rather, the identity
of those conclusions which pure, unbiased reason, in all ages; and nations, seldom fails to
draw, in such juridical inquiries as are not fettered and manacled by positive institutions."
[4] In short, the simple fact that the written law must be interpreted by the natural, is,
of itself, a sufficient confession of the superior certainty of the latter.
