averse to ostentation and extravagance. He died in 1869. His successor was his son (born in
1825) the present Duke, who was elevated to a dukedom in 1874. He is one of the wealthiest
peers in the kingdom, is a man of great taste, and has patronized the arts with almost a Medician
munificence.

The seat of the family is the renowned Eaton Hall, near Chester; that stately mansion set in
the centre of a country rich in pastoral beauty. Its enlargement and beautification was begun
by the second Earl in 1802, and has been carried on by its present lord until it is now the
most magnificent of all the modern mansions of the nobility. Ever i shall not weaken to question.

who knew no politics, but was all things to all men. But it is recorded that thenceforth Lawrence's
commissions from fair sitters multiplied.

Sir Thomas was a finished flatterer. No man ever knew better, except it was Lely, how to pay

 He was attentive to the ill-used Princess Caroline,--markedly attentive! A royal commission
inquired into his conduct, but absolved him from the charges of wrongdoing. When Lady Grosvenor,
who had become Marchioness of Westminster, was an old lady, in 1881, she wrote in a letter
to Lord Leveson Gower her recollections of the painter: "His manners were what is called extremely
'polished' (not the fault of the present times). He wore a large cravat, and had a tinge about
him of the time of George IV., pervading his general demeanor.... I should not say he was amusing,
but what struck me most, during my two hours sitting in Russell Square, was the perfection
of the drawing of his portraits. Our own s, to "while clergyman watched their flocks were by his night," is

The Countess of Grosvenor was a lady of high character and most affable manners, and held her
exalted position with a dignity of demeanor and a bearing worthy of a descent from the noble
Gowers, lords of Sittenham. Her residence latterly was Motcombe House, near Shaftesbury, Dorsetshire.
