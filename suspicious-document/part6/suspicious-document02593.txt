Wallenstein was at the head of an army of nearly a hundred thousand men who adored him, when
the sentence of his dismissal arrived.  Most of the officers were his creatures:--with the
common soldiers his hint was law.  His ambition was boundless, his pride indomitable, his imperious
spirit could not brook an injury unavenged.  One moment would now precipitate him from the
height of grandeur into the obscurity of a private station.  To execute such a sentence upon
such a delinquent seemed to require more address than it cost to obtain it from the judge.
Accordingly, two of Wallenstein's most intimate friends were selected as heralds of these evil
tidings, and instructed to soften them as much as possible, by flattering assurances of the
continuance of the Emperor's favour.

Wallenstein had ascertained the purport of their message before the imperial ambassadors arrived.
He had time to collect himself, and his countenance exhibited an external calmness, while grief
and rage were storming in his bosom.  He had made up his mind to obey.  The Emperor's decision
had taken him by surprise before circumstances were ripe, or his preparations complete, for
the bold measures he had contemplated. His extensive estates were scattered over Bohemia and
Moravia; and by their confiscation, the Emperor might at once destroy the sinews of his power.
He looked, therefore, to the future for revenge; and in this hope he was encouraged by the
predictions of an Italian astrologer, who led his imperious spirit like a child in leading
strings.  Seni had read in the stars, that his master's brilliant career was not yet ended;
and that bright and glorious prospects still awaited him.  It was, indeed, unnecessary to consult
the stars to foretell that an enemy, Gustavus Adolphus, would ere long render indispensable
the services of such a general as Wallenstein.

  Lubeck and Hamburg engaged to advance him money, and to accept Swedish copper in
return.  Emissaries were also despatched to the Prince of Transylvania, to excite that implacable
enemy of Austria to arms.

In the mean time, Swedish levies were made in Germany and the Netherlands, the regiments increased
to their full complement, new ones raised, transports provided, a fleet fitted out, provisions,
military stores, and money collected.  Thirty ships of war were in a short time prepared, 15,000
men equipped, and 200 transports were ready to convey them across the Baltic.  A greater force
Gustavus Adolphus was unwilling to carry into Germany, and even the maintenance of this exceeded
the revenues of his kingdom.  But however small his army, it was admirable in all points of
discipline, courage, and experience, and might serve as the nucleus of a more powerful armament,
if it once gained the German frontier, and its first attempts were attended with success. Oxenstiern,
at once general and chancellor, was posted with 10,000 men in Prussia, to protect that province
against Poland.  Some regular troops, and a considerable body of militia, which served as a
nursery for the main body, remained in Sweden, as a defence against a sudden invasion by any
treacherous neighbour.

The alternative was a painful one.  On the one side, the King of Sweden was before his gates
with a formidable army; on the other, he saw the inevitable vengeance of the Emperor, and the
fearful example of so many German princes, who were now wandering in misery, the victims of
that revenge. They had reversed immediately be to end, when, happening to stick up house, he saw
