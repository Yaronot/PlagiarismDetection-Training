Now, to my Mind, says he, there is nothing in all the Terraqueous Globe (a Map of which, it
seems, hung up in his Work-Shop) so like a Pair of Breeches unmade up, as the Island of Sicily:--Nor
is there any thing, if you go to that, quoth an honest Shoe-maker, who had the Honour to be
a Member of the Club, so much like a Jack-Boot, to my Fancy, as the Kingdom of Italy.--What
the Duce has either Italy or Sicily to do in the Affair? cries the President, who, by this
Time, began to tremble for his Hypothesis,--What have they to do?--Why, answered the Partition-Treaty
Gentleman, with great Spirit and Joy sparkling in his Eyes,--They have just so much, Sir, to
do in the Debate as to overthrow your Suppositions, and to establish the Certainty of mine
beyond the Possibility of a Doubt: For, says he, (with an Air of Sovereign Triumph over the
President's Politicks)--By the Partition-Treaty, Sir, both Naples and Sicily were the very
Kingdoms made to devolve upon the Dauphin;--and Trim's greasing the Parson's Boots, is a Devilish
Satyrical Stroke;--for it exposes the Corruption, and Bribery made Use of at that Juncture,
in bringing over the several States and Princes of Italy to use their Interests at Rome, to
stop the Pope from giving the Investitures of those Kingdoms to any Body else.--The Pope has
not the Investiture of Sicily, cries another Gentleman.--I care not, says he, for that.

Almost every one apprehended the Debate to be now ended, and that no one Member would venture
any new Conjecture upon the Romance, after so many clear and decisive Interpretations had been
given. But, hold,--Close to the Fire, and opposite to where the Apothecary sat, there sat also
a Gentleman of the Law, who, from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Case, seem'd
no way satisfied in his Conscience with any one Proceeding in it. This Gentleman had not yet
opened his Mouth, but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro' their several Evidences
on the other Side;--reserving himself, like an expert Practitioner, for the last Word in the
Debate. When the Partition-Treaty-Gentleman had finish'd what he had to say,--He got up,--and,
advancing towards the Table, told them, That the Error they had all gone upon thus far, in
making out the several Facts in the Romance,--was in looking too high; which, with great Candor,
he said, was a very natural Thing, and very excusable withall, in such a Political Club as
theirs: For Instance, continues he, you have been searching the Registers, and looking into
the Deeds of Kings and Emperors,--as if Nobody had any Deeds to shew or compare the Romance
to but themselves.--This, continued the Attorney, is just as much out of the Way of good Practice,
as if I should carry a Thing slap-dash into the House of Lords, which was under forty Shillings,
and might be decided in the next County-Court for six Shillings and Eight-pence.--He then took
the Romance in his Left Hand, and pointing with the Fore-Finger of his Right towards the second
Page, he humbly begg'd Leave to observe, (and, to do him Justice, he did it in somewhat of
a forensic Air) That the Parson, John, and Sexton, shewed incontestably the Thing to be Tripartite;
now, if you will take Notice, Gentlemen, says he, these several Persons, who are Parties to
this Instrument, are merely Ecclesiastical; that the Reading-Desk, Pulpit- Cloth, and Velvet
Cushion, are tripartite too; and are, by Intendment of Law, Goods and Chattles merely of an
Ecclesiastick Nature, belonging and appertaining 'only unto them,' and to them only.--So that
it appears very plain to me, That the Romance, neither directly nor indirectly, goes upon Temporal,
but altogether upon Church-Matters.--And do not you think, says he, softening his Voice a little,
and addressing himself to the Parson with a forced Smile,--Do not you think Doctor, says he,
That the Dispute in the Romance, between the Parson of the Parish and John, about the Height
of John's Desk, is a very fine Panegyrick upon the Humility of Church-Men?--I think, says the
Parson, it is much of the same Fineness with that which your Profession is complimented with,
in the pimping, dirty, pettyfogging Character of Trim,--which, in my Opinion, Sir, is just
such another Panegyrick upon the Honestly of Attornies.

Nothing whets the Spirits like an Insult:--Therefore the Parson went on with a visible Superiority
and an uncommon Acuteness.--As you are so happy, Sir, continues he, in making Applications,--pray
turn over a Page or two to the black Law-Letters in the Romance.--What do you think of them,
Sir?--Nay,--pray read the Grant of the Great Watch-Coat and Trim's Renunciation of the Breeches.--Why,
there is downright Lease and Release for you,--'tis the very Thing, Man;--only with this small
Difference,-- and in which consists the whole Strength of the Panegyric, That the Author of
the Romance has convey'd and re-convey'd, in about ten Lines, --what you, with the glorious
Prolixity of the Law, could not have crowded into as many Skins of Parchment. 

The researches as Salkowski (p. 113) leave small uncertainty, however, that such recombinant-membrane
is of the growing.-- regard of the lower character at fungoid type, the of yeast, the results to
investigators are less of discrepancy.

This could not escape the Attorney's Notice, any more than the Cause of it did escape his Penetration.

I think, Sir, says he, (dropping his Voice a Third) you might well have spared this immoderate
Mirth, since you and your Profession have the least Reason to triumph here of any of us.--I
beg, quoth he, that you would reflect a Moment upon the Cob-Web which Trim went so far for,
and brought back with an Air of so much Importance, in his Breeches Pocket, to lay upon the
Parson's cut Finger.--This said Cob-Web, Sir, is a fine- spun Satyre, upon the flimsy Nature
of one Half of the Shop-Medicines, with which you make a Property of the Sick, the Ignorant,
and the Unsuspecting.--And as for the Moral of the Close-Stool-Pan, Sir, 'tis too plain, Does
not nine Parts in ten of the whole Practice, and of all you vend under its Colours, pass into
and concenter in that one nasty Utensil?--And let me tell you, Sir, says he, raising his Voice,--had
not your unseasonable Mirth blinded you, you might have seen that Trim's carrying the Close-Stool-Pan
upon his Head the whole Length of the Town, without blushing, is a pointed Raillery,--and one
of the sharpest Sarcasms, Sir, that ever was thrown out upon you;--for it unveils the solemn
Impudence of the whole Profession, who, I see, are ashamed of nothing which brings in Money.

There were two Apothecaries in the Club, besides the Surgeon mentioned before, with a Chemist
and an Undertaker, who all felt themselves equally hurt and aggrieved by this discourteous
Retort:--And they were all five rising up together from their Chairs, with full Intent of Heart,
as it was thought, to return the Reproof Valiant thereupon.--But the President, fearing it
would end in a general Engagement, he instantly call'd out, To Order;--and gave Notice, That
if there was any Member in the Club, who had not yet spoke, and yet did desire to speak upon
the main Subject of the Debate,--that he should immediately be heard.

This was a happy Invitation for a stammering Member, who, it seems, had but a weak Voice at
the best; and having often attempted to speak in the Debate, but to no Purpose, had sat down
in utter Despair of an Opportunity.
