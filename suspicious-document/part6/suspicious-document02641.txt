"I am sure he's all right, Brother Rae."

Content with this, at last, he watched the farther flat shore of the Mississippi, with its
low fringe of green along the edge, where they were to land and be at last out of the mob's
reach. He repeated his father's words: "Thank God, they're like all snakes; they can't jump
beyond their own length."

The confusion of landing and the preparations for an immediate start drove for the time all
other thoughts from his mind. It had been determined to get the little band at once out of
the marshy spot where the camp had been made. The teams were soon hitched, the wagons loaded,
and the train ready to move. He surveyed it, a hundred poor wagons, many of them without cover,
loaded to the full with such nondescript belongings as a house-dwelling people, suddenly put
out on the open road, would hurriedly snatch as they fled. And the people made his heart ache,
even to the deadening of his own sorrow, as he noted their wobegoneness. For these were the
sick, the infirm, the poor, the inefficient, who had been unable for one reason or another
to migrate with the main body of the Saints earlier in the season. Many of them were now racked
by fever from sleeping on the damp ground. These bade fair not to outlast some of the lumbering
carts that threatened at every rough spot to jolt apart.

Yet the line bravely formed to the order of Seth Wright as captain, and the march began. Looking
back, he saw peaceful Nauvoo, its houses and gardens, softened by the cloudy sky and the autumn
haze, clustering under the shelter of their temple spire,--their temple and their houses, of
which they were now despoiled by a mob's fury. Ahead he saw the road to the West, a hard road,
as he knew,--one he could not hope they should cross without leaving more graves by the way;
but Zion was at the end.

The wagons and carts creaked and strained and rattled under their swaying loads, and the line
gradually defined itself along the road from the confused jumble at the camp. He remembered
his father again now, and hurried forward to assure himself that all was right. As he overtook
along the way the stumbling ones obliged to walk, he tried to cheer them.

"Only a short march to-day, brothers. Our camp is at Sugar Creek, nine miles--so take your
time this first day."

Near the head of the train were his own two wagons, and beside the first walked Seth Wright
and Keaton, in low, earnest converse. As he came up to them the Bishop spoke.

"I got Wes' and Alec Gregg to drive awhile so we could stretch our legs." But then came a quick
change of tone, as they halted by the road.

"Joel, there's no use beatin' about the bush--them devils at the ferry jest now drowned your pa."

He went cold all over. Keaton, looking sympathetic but frightened, spoke next.

"You ought to thank me, Brother Rae, for not telling you on the other side, when you asked
me. I knew better. Because, why? Because I knew you'd fly off the handle and get yourself killed,
and then your ma'd be left all alone, that's why, now--and prob'ly they'd 'a' wound up by dumping
the whole passle of us bag and baggage into the stream. And it wa'n't any use, your father
bein' dead and gone."

The Bishop took up the burden, slapping him cordially on the back.

"Come, come,--hearten up, now! Your pa's been made a martyr--he's beautified his inheritance
in Zion--whinin' won't do no good."

He drew himself up with a shrug, as if to throw off an invisible burden, and answered, calmly:

"I'm not whining, Bishop. Perhaps you were right not to tell me over there, Keaton. I'd have
made trouble for you all." He smiled painfully in his effort to control himself. "Were you
there, Bishop?"

"No, I'd already gone acrost. Keaton here saw it."

Keaton took up the tale.

"I was there when the old gentleman drove down singing, 'Lo, the Gentile chain is broken.'
He was awful chipper. Then one of 'em called him old Father Time, and he answered back. I disremember
what, but, any way, one word fired another until they was cussin' Giles Rae up hill and down
dale, and instead of keepin' his head shet like he had ought to have done, he was prophesyin'
curses, desolations, famines, and pestilences on 'em all, and callin' 'em enemies of Christ.
He was sassy--I can't deny that--and that's where he wa'n't wise. Some of the mobocrats was
drunk and some was mad; they was all in their high-heeled boots one way or another, and he
enraged 'em more. So he says, finally, 'The Jews fell,' he says, 'because they wouldn't receive
their Messiah, the Shiloh, the Saviour. They wet their hands,' he says, 'in the best blood
that had flowed through the lineage of Judah, and they had to pay the cost. And so will you
cowards of Illinois,' he says, 'have to pay the penalty for sheddin' the blood of Joseph Smith,
the best blood that has flowed since the Lord's Christ,' he says. 'The wrath of God,' he says,
'will abide upon you.' The old gentleman was a powerful denouncer when he was in the spirit
of it--"

"Come, come, Keaton, hurry, for God's sake--get on!"

"And he made 'em so mad, a-settin' up there so peart and brave before 'em, givin' 'em as good
as they sent--givin' 'em hell right to their faces, you might say, that at last they made for
him, some of them that you could see had been puttin' a new faucet into the cider barrel. I
saw they meant to do him a mischief--but Lord! what could I do against fifty, being then in
the midst of a chill? Well, they drug him off the seat, and said, 'Now, you old rat, own up
that Holy Joe was a danged fraud;' or something like that. But he was that sanctified and stubborn--'
Better to suffer stripes for the testimony of Christ,' he says, 'than to fall by the sin of
denial!' Then they drug him to the bank, one on each side, and says, 'We baptise you in the
holy name of Brockman,' and in they dumped him--backwards, mind you! I saw then they was in
a slippery place where it was deep and the current awful strong. But they hauled him out, and
says again, 'Do you renounce Holy Joe Smith and all his works?' The poor old fellow couldn't
talk a word for the chill, but he shook his head like sixty--as stubborn as you'd wish. So
they said, 'Damn you! here's another, then. We baptise you in the name of James K. Polk, President
of the United States!' and in they threw him again. Whether they done it on purpose or not,
I wouldn't like to say, but that time his coat collar slipped out of their hands and down he
went. He came up ten feet down-stream and quite a ways out, and they hooted at him. I seen
him come up once after that, and then they see he couldn't swim a stroke, but little they cared.
And I never saw him again. I jest took hold of the team and drove it on the boat, scared to
death for what you'd do when you come,--so I kept still and they kept still. But remember,
it's only another debt the blood of the Gentiles will have to pay--"

"Either here on earth or in hell," said the Bishop.

"And the soul of your poor pa is now warm and dry and happy in the presence of his Lord God."

CHAPTER VI.

The Lute of the Holy Ghost Is Further Chastened

Listening to Keaton's tale, he had dimly seen the caravan of hunted creatures crawl past him
over the fading green of the prairie; the wagons with their bowed white covers; a heavy cart,
jolting, creaking, lumbering mysteriously along, a sick driver hidden somewhere back under
its makeshift cover of torn counterpanes; a battered carriage, reminiscent of past luxury,
drawn by oxen; more wagons, some without covers; a two-wheeled cart, designed in the ingenuity
of desperation, laden with meal-sacks, a bundle of bedding, a sleeping child, and drawn by
a little dry-dugged heifer; then more wagons with stooping figures trudging doggedly beside
them, here a man, there a woman leading a child. He saw them as shapes floating by in a dream,
blurred and inconsequent. But between himself and the train, more clearly outlined to his gaze,
he saw the worn face of his father tossed on the cold, dark waters, being swept down by the
stream, the weak old hands clutching for some support in the muddy current, the white head
with the chin held up sinking lower at each failure, then at last going under, gulping, to
leave a little row of bubbles down the stream.

In a craze of rage and grief he turned toward the river, when he heard the sharp voice of the
Bishop calling him back.

"It ain't any use, Joel."

"Couldn't we find his body?"

"Not a chance in a thousand. It was carried down by the current. It would mean days and mebbe
weeks. Besides, we need you here. Here's your duty. Sakes alive! If we only had about twenty
minutes with them cusses like it was in the old days! When you're ready to be a Son of Dan
you'll know what I mean. But never mind, we'll see the day yet when Israel will be the head
and not the tail."

"My mother? Has any one told her?"

"Wal, now, I'm right sorry about that, but it got out before you come over. Tarlton McKenny's
boy, Nephi, rowed over in a skiff and brought the news, and some of the women went and tattled
it to your ma. I guess it upset her considerable. You go up and see her."

He ran forward toward the head of the train, hearing as he went words of sympathy hurried to
him by those he passed. Mounting the wagon, he climbed over the seat to where his mother lay.
She seemed to sleep in spite of the jolting. The driver called back to him:

"She took on terrible for a spell, Brother Rae. She's only jest now got herself pacified."

He put his hand on her forehead and found it burning. She stirred and moaned and muttered disjointed
sentences. He heard his father's name, his sister's, and his own, and he knew she was delirious.
He eased her bed as well as he could, and made a place for himself beside her where he could
sit and take one of the pale, thin hands between his own and try to endow her with some of
his abundant life. He stayed by her until their camping-place was reached.

Once for a moment she opened her eyes with what seemed to him a more than normal clearness
and understanding and memory in them. Though she looked at him long without speaking, she seemed
to say all there was to say, so that the brief span was full of anguish for him. He sighed
with relief when the consciousness faded again from her look, and she fell to babbling once
more of some long gone day in her girlhood.

When the wagon halted he was called outside by the driver, who wished instructions regarding
the camp to be made. A few moments later he was back, and raised the side of the wagon cover
to let in the light. The look on her face alarmed him. It seemed to tell unmistakably that
the great change was near. Already she looked moribund. An irregular gasping for breath, an
occasional delirious mutter, were the only signs of life. She was too weak to show restlessness.
Her pinched and faded face was covered with tiny cold beads. The pupils of her eyes were strangely
dilated, and the eyes themselves were glazed. There was no pulse at her wrist, and from her
heart only the faintest beating could be heard. In quick terror he called to a boy working
at a wagon near by.

"Go for Bishop Wright and tell him to bring that apothecary with him."

The two came up briskly a few moments later, and he stood aside for them in an agony of suspense.
The Bishop turned toward him after a long look into the wagon.

"She's gone to be with your pa, Joel. You can't do anything--only remember they're both happy
now for bein' together."

It made little stir in the busy encampment. There had been other deaths while they lay out
on the marshy river flats. Others of the sorry band were now sick unto death, and many more
would die on the long march across the Iowa prairie, dropping out one by one of fever, starvation,
exposure. He stood helpless in this chaos of woe, shut up within himself, knowing not where
to turn.

Some women came presently from the other wagons to prepare the body for burial. He watched
them dumbly, from a maze of incredulity, feeling that some wretched pretense was being acted
before him.

The Bishop and Keaton came up. They brought with them the makeshift coffin. They had cut a
log, split it, and stripped off its bark in two half-cylinders. They led him to the other side
of the wagon, out of sight. Then they placed the strips of bark around the body, bound them
with hickory withes, and over the rough surface the women made a little show of black cloth.

For the burial they could do no more than consign the body to one of the waves in the great
billowy land sea about them. They had no tombstone, nor were there even rocks to make a simple
cairn. He saw them bury her, and thought there was little to choose between hers and the grave
of his father, whose body was being now carried noiselessly down in the bed of the river. The
general locality would be kept by landmarks, by the bearing of valley bends, headlands, or
the fork and angles of constant streams. But the spot itself would in a few weeks be lost.

When the last office had been performed, the prayer said, a psalm sung, and the black dirt
thrown in, they waited by him in sympathy. His feeling was that they had done a monstrous thing;
that the mother he had known was somewhere alive and well. He stood a moment so, watching the
sun sink below the far rim of the prairie while the white moon swung into sight in the east.
Then the Bishop led him gently by the arm to his own camp.

There cheer abounded. They had a huge camp-fire tended by the Bishop's numerous children. Near
by was a smaller fire over which the good man's four wives, able-bodied, glowing, and cordial,
cooked the supper. In little ways they sought to lighten his sorrow or to put his mind away
from it. To this end the Bishop contributed by pouring him drink from a large brown jug.

"Not that I approve of it, boy, but it'll hearten you,--some of the best peach brandy I ever
sniffed. I got it at the still-house last week for use in time of trouble,--and this here time
is it."

He drank the fiery stuff from the gourd in which it was given him, and choked until they brought
him water. But presently the warmth stole along his cold, dead nerves so that he became intensely
alive from head to foot, and strangely exalted. And when they offered him food he ate eagerly
and talked. It seemed to him there had been a thousand matters that he had long wished to speak
of; matters of moment in which he felt deeply; yet on which he had strangely neglected to touch
till now.

He talked long with the Bishop when the women had climbed into their wagon for the night. He
amazed that good man by asking him if the Lord would not be pleased to have them, now, as they
were, go back to Nauvoo and descend upon the Gentiles to smite them. The Bishop counselled
him to have patience.

"What could we do how with these few old fusees and cheap arms that we managed to smuggle across--to
say nothing of half of us being down sick?"

"But we are Israel, and surely Israel's God--"

"The Lord had His chance the other day if He'd wanted it, when they took the town. No, Joel,
He means us to gether out and become strong enough to beat 'em in our own might. But you wait;
our day will come, and all the more credit to us then for doin' it ourselves. Then we'll consecrate
the herds and flocks of the Gentile and his store and basket, his gold and silver, and his
myrrh and frankincense. But for the present--well, we got to be politic and kind of modest
about such doin's. The big Fan, the Sons of Dan, done good work in Missouri and better in Nauvoo,
and it'll do still better where we're goin'. But we must be patient. Only next time we'll get
to work quicker. If the Gentiles had been seen to quicker in Nauvoo, Joseph would be with us
now. We learned our lesson there. Now the Lord has unfurled a Standard of Zion for the gathering
of Israel, and this time we'll fix the Gentiles early."

"Amen! Brother Seth."

A look of deep hatred had clouded the older man's face as he spoke. He continued.

"Let the wrath of God abide upon 'em, and remember that we're bein' tried and proved for a
purpose. And we got to be more practical. You been too theoretical yourself and too high-flyin'
in your notions. The Kingdom ain't to be set up on earth by faith alone. The Lord has got to
have works, like I told you about the other day."

"You were right, Bishop, I need to be more practical. The olive-branch and not the sword would
Ephraim extend to Japheth, but if--"

"If Japheth don't toe the mark the Lord's will must be worked upon him."

"So be it, Brother Seth! I am ready now to be a Son of Dan."

The Bishop rose from in front of their fire and looked about. No one was near. Here and there
a fire blazed, and the embers of many more could be seen dying out in the distance. The nearest
camp was that of the fever-stricken man who had fled on to the boat that morning with his child
in his arms. They could see his shaven head in the firelight, and a woman hovering over him
as he lay on the ground with a tattered quilt fixed over him in lieu of a tent. From another
group came the strains of an accordion and the chorus of a hymn.

"That's right," said the Bishop. "I knew you'd come to it. I saw that long ago. Brother Brigham
saw it, too. We knew you could be relied on. You want the oath, do you?"

"Yes, yes, Brother Seth. I was ready for it this morning when they told me about father."

"Hold up your right hand and repeat after me:

"'In the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I do covenant and agree to support the first
Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in all things right or wrong;
I will faithfully guard them and report to them the acts of all men as far as in my power lies;
I will assist in executing all the decrees of the first President, Patriarch, or President
of the Twelve, and I will cause all who speak evil of the Presidency or Heads of the Church
to die the death of dissenters or apostates, unless they speedily confess and repent, for pestilence,
persecution, and death shall follow the enemies of Zion. I will be a swift herald of salvation
and messenger of peace to the Saints, and I will never make known the secret purposes of this
Society called the Sons of Dan, my life being the forfeiture in a fire of burning tar and brimstone.
So help me God and keep me steadfast.'"

He repeated the words without hesitation, with fervour in his voice, and the light of a holy
and implacable zeal in his face.

"Now I'll give you the blessing, too. Wait till I get my bottle of oil."

He stepped to the nearest wagon, felt under the cover, and came back with a small bottle in
his hand.

"Stand jest here--so--now!"

They stood at the edge of the wavering firelight, and he put his hand on the other's head.

"'In the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and by the authority of the Holy Priesthood,
the first President, Patriarch, and High Priest of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, representing the first, second, and third Gods in Heaven, the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, I do now anoint you with holy consecrated oil, and by the imposition of my hands do
ordain and set you apart for the holy calling whereunto you are called; that you may consecrate
the riches of the Gentiles to the House of Israel, bring swift destruction upon apostate sinners,
and execute the decrees of Heaven without fear of what man can do with you. So mote it be. Amen.'

"There, boy, if I ain't mistaken, that's the best work for Zion that I done for some time.
Now be off to your rest!"

"Good night, Bishop, and thank you for being kind to me! The Church Poet called me the Lute
of the Holy Ghost, but I feel to-night, that I must be another Lion of the Lord. Good night!"

He went out of the firelight and stumbled through the dark to his own wagons. But when he came
to them he could not stop. Under all the exhilaration he had been conscious of the great pain
within him, drugged for the moment, but never wholly stifled. Now the stimulus of the drink
had gone, and the pain had awakened to be his master.

He went past the wagons and out on to the prairie that stretched away, a sea of silvery gray
in the moonlight. As he walked, the whole stupendous load of sorrow settled upon him. His breath
caught and his eyes burned with the tears that lay behind them. He walked faster to flee from
it, but it came upon him more heavily until it made a breaking load,--the loss of his sister
by worse than death, his father and mother driven out at night and their home burned, his father
killed by a mob whose aim had lacked even the dignity of the murderer's--for they had seemingly
intended but a brutal piece of horse-play; his mother dead from exposure due to Gentile persecutions;
the girl he had loved taken from him by Gentile persuasions. If only she had been left him
so that now he could put his head down upon her shoulder, slight as that shoulder was, and
feel the supreme soothing of a woman's touch; if only the hurts had not all come at once! The
pain sickened him. He was far out on the prairie now, away from the sleeping encampment, and
he threw himself down to give way to his grief. Almost silently he wept, yet with sobs that
choked him and cramped him from head to foot. He called to his mother and to his father and
to the sister who had gone before them, crying their names over and over in the night. But
under all his sorrow he felt as great a rage against the Gentile nation that had driven them
into the wilderness.

When the spasm of grief had passed, he still lay there a long time. Then becoming chilled he
walked again over the prairie, watching the moon go down and darkness come to make the stars
brighter, and then the day show gray in the east. And as he walked against his sorrow, the
burden of his thought came to be: "God has tried me more than most men; therefore he expects
more of me; and my reward shall be greater. New visions shall be given to me, and a new power,
and this poor, hunted, plundered remnant of Israel shall find me their staff. Much has been
taken from me, but much will be given unto me."

And under this ran a minor strain born of the rage that still burned within him:

"But, oh, the day of wrath that shall dawn on yonder Gentiles!"

So did he chasten himself through the night; and when the morning came he took his place in
the train, strangely exalted by this new sense of the singular favour that was to be conferred
upon him.

For seven weeks the little caravan crept over the prairies of Iowa, and day after day his conviction
strengthened that he had been chosen for large works. In this fervour he cheered the sick and
the weak of the party by picturing for them a great day to come when the Lord should exalt
the valleys of humility and abase the mountains of Gentile pride; when the Saints should have
their reward, and retribution should descend upon the wicked nation they were leaving behind.
Scourges, afflictions, and depredations by fire, famine, and the tyrant's hand he besought
them to regard as marks of Heaven's especial favour.

The company came to look upon him as its cloud by day and its pillar of fire by night. Old
women--mothers in Israel--lavished attentions upon him as a motherless boy; young women smiled
at him with soft pity, and were meek and hushed when he spoke. And the men believed that the
things he told them concerning their great day to come were true revelations from God. They
did not hesitate to agree with the good Bishop Wright, who declared in words of pointed admiration,
"When that young man gets all het up with the Holy Ghost, the Angel of the Lord jest has to
give down!"

CHAPTER VII.

Some Inner Mysteries Are Expounded

The hosts of Israel had been forced to tarry for the winter on the banks of the Missouri. A
few were on the east side at Council Bluffs on the land of the Pottawattamie Indians. Across
the river on the land of the Omahas the greater part of the force had settled at what was known
as Winter Quarters. Here in huts of logs, turf, and other primitive materials, their town had
been laid out with streets and byways, a large council-house, a mill, a stockade, and blockhouses.
The Indians had received them with great friendliness, feeling with them a common cause of
grievance, since the heavy hand of the Gentile had pushed them also to this bleak frontier.

To this settlement early in November came the last train from Nauvoo, its members wearied and
wasted by the long march, but staunch in their faith and with hope undimmed. It was told in
after years how there had leaped from the van of this train a very earnest young man, who had
at once sought an audience with Brigham Young and certain other members of the Twelve who had
chanced to be present at the train's arrival; and how, being closeted with these, he had eagerly
inquired if it might not be the will of the Lord that they should go no farther into the wilderness,
but stand their ground and give battle to the Gentiles forthwith. He made the proposal as one
who had a flawless faith that the God of Battles would be with them, and he appeared to believe
that something might be done that very day to force the matter to an issue. When he had made
his proposal, he waited in a modest attitude to hear their views of it. To his chagrin, all
but two of those who had listened laughed. One of these two, Bishop Snow,--a man of holy aspect
whom the Church Poet had felicitously entitled the Entablature of Truth,--had looked at him
searchingly, then put his hand upon his own head and shaken it hopelessly to the others.

The other who had not laughed was Brigham himself. For to this great man had been given the
gift to look upon men and to know in one slow sweep of his wonderful eyes all their strength
and all their weakness. He had listened with close attention to the remarkable plan suggested
by this fiery young zealot, and he studied him now with a gaze that was kind. A noticeable
result of this attitude of Brigham's was that those who had laughed became more or less awkwardly
silent, while the Entablature of Truth, in the midst of his pantomime, froze into amazement.

At last, in the middle of April, the signs were seen to be right. Grass grew and water ran,
and their part, allotted by the Lord, was to brave the dangers of that forbidding land that
lay under the western sun. Then came a day of farewells and merry-making. In the afternoon,
the day being mild and sunny, there was a dance in the bowery,--a great arbour made of poles
and brush and wattling. Here, where the ground had been trodden firm, the age and maturity
as well as the youth and beauty of Israel gathered in such poor festal array as they had been
able to save from their ravaged stores.

The Twelve Apostles led off in a double cotillion, to the moving strains of a violin and horn,
the lively jingle of a string of sleigh-bells, and the genial snoring of a tambourine. Then
came dextrous displays in the dances of our forbears, who followed the fiddle to the Fox-chase
Inn or Garden of Gray's Ferry. There were French Fours, Copenhagen jigs, Virginia reels,--spirited
figures blithely stepped. And the grave-faced, square-jawed Elders seemed as eager as the unthinking
youths and maidens to throw off for the moment the burden of their cares.

From midday until the April sun dipped below the sharp skyline of the Omaha hills, the modest
revel endured. Then silence was called by a grim-faced, hard-voiced Elder, who announced:

"The Lute of the Holy Ghost will now say a word of farewell from our pioneers to those who
must stay behind."

He stood before them erect, brave, confident; and the fire of his faith warmed his voice into
their hearts.

"Children of Israel, we are going into the wilderness to lay the foundations of a temple to
the most high God, so that when his Son, our elder Brother, shall come on earth again, He may
have a place where He can lay His head and spend, not only a night or a day, but rest until
He can say, 'I am satisfied!'--a place, too, where you can obtain the ordinances of salvation
for yourselves, your living, and your dead. Let your prayers go with us. We have been thrust
out of Babylon, but to our eternal salvation. We care no more for persecution than for the
whistle of the north wind, the croaking of the crane that flies over our heads, or the crackling
of thorns under a pot. True, some of our dearest, our best-loved, have dropped by the way;
they have fallen asleep, but what of that?--and who cares? It is as well to live as to die,
or to die as to live--as well to sleep as to be awake. It is all one. They have only gone a
little before us; and we shall soon strike hands with them across those poor, mean, empty graves
back there on the forlorn prairies of Iowa. For you must let me clench this God's truth into
your minds; that you stand now in your last lot, in the end of your days when the Son of Man
cometh again. Afflictions shall be sent to humble and to prove you, but oh! stand fast to your
teachings so that not one of you may be lost. May sinners in Zion become afraid henceforth,
and fearfulness surprise the hypocrite from this hour! And now may the favour and blessing
of God be manifest upon you while we are absent from one another!"

When the fervent amens had died away they sang the farewell hymn:--

  "Thrones shall totter, Babel fall,
   Satan reign no more at all;

  "Saints shall gain the victory,
   Truth prevail o'er land and sea;

  "Gentile tyrants sink to hell;
   Now's the day of Israel."

The words of the young Elder were felt to be highly consoling; but a toast given by Brigham
that night was longer talked of. It was at a farewell party at the house of Bishop Wright.
On the hay-covered floor of the banquet-room, amid the lights of many candles hung from the
ceiling and about the walls in their candelabra of hollowed turnips, the great man had been
pleased to prophesy blessings profusely upon the assembled guests.

"I am awful proud," he began, "of the way the Lord has favoured us. I am proud all the time
of his Elders, his servants, and his handmaids. And when they do well I am prouder still. I
don't know but I'll get so proud that I'll be four or five times prouder than I am now. As
I once said to Sidney Rigdon, our boat is an old snag boat and has never been out of Snag-harbour.
But it will root up the snags, run them down, split them, and scatter them to the four quarters.
Our ship is the old ship of Zion; and nothing that runs foul of her can withstand her shock
and fury."

Then had followed the toast, which was long remembered for its dauntless spirit.

"Here's wishing that all the mobocrats of the nineteenth century were in the middle of the
sea, in a stone canoe, with an iron paddle; that a shark would swallow the canoe, and the shark
be thrust into the nethermost part of hell, with the door locked, the key lost, and a blind
man looking for it!"

CHAPTER IX.

Into the Wilderness

Onto the West at last to build the house of God in the mountains.

The little band of pioneers chosen to break a way for the main body of the Saints consisted
of a hundred and forty-three men, three women, and two children. They were to travel in seventy-three
wagons, drawn by horses and oxen. They knew not where they were to stop, but they were men
of eager initiative, fearless and determined; and their consolation was that, while their exodus
into the desert meant hardship and grievous suffering, it also promised them freedom from Gentile
interference. It was not a fat land into which they were venturing; but at least it was a land
without a past, lying clean as it came from the hand of its maker, where they could be free
to worship God without fearing the narrow judgment of the frivolous. Instructed in the sacred
mysteries revealed to Joseph Smith through the magic light of the Urim and Thummim, and sustained
by the divine message engraved on the golden plates he had dug up from the hill of Cumorah,
they were now ready to feel their way across the continent and blaze a trail to the new Jerusalem.

They went in military style with due precautions against surprise by the Lamanites--the wretched
red remnant of Abraham's seed--that swarmed on every side.

Brigham Young was lieutenant-general; Stephen Markham was colonel; the redoubtable John Pack
was first major, and Shadrach Roundy, second. There were two captains of hundreds and fourteen
captains of tens. The orders of the lieutenant-general required each man to walk constantly
beside his wagon, leaving it only by his officer's commands. To make the force compact, the
wagons were to move two abreast where they could. Every man was to keep his weapons loaded.
If the gun was a caplock, the cap was to be taken off and a piece of leather put on to exclude
moisture and dirt; if a flintlock, the filling was to be taken out and the pan filled with
tow or cotton.

Their march was not only cautious but orderly. At five A.M. the bugle sounded for rising, two
hours being allowed for prayers and breakfast. At night each man had to retire to his wagon
for prayer at eight-thirty, and to rest at nine. If they camped by a river they drew the wagons
into a semicircle with the river at its base. Other times the wagons made a circle, a fore-wheel
of one touching a rear wheel of the next, thus providing a corral for the stock. In such manner
was the wisdom of the Lord concerning this hegira supplemented in detail by the worldly forethought
of his servant Brigham.

They started along the north bank of the Platte River under the auspicious shine of an April
sun. A better route was along the south bank where grass was more plentiful and the Indians
less troublesome. But along the south bank parties of migrating Gentiles might also be met,
and these sons of perdition were to be avoided at any cost--"at least for the present," said
Brigham, in tones of sage significance.

And so for two hundred miles they broke a new way over the plains, to be known years after
as "the old Mormon trail," to be broadened later by the gold-seekers of forty-nine, and still
later to be shod with steel, when the miracle of a railway was worked in the desert.

To Joel Rae, Elder after the order of Melchisedek, unsullied product of the temple priesthood,
it was a time of wondrous soul-growth. In that mysterious realm of pathless deserts, of illimitable
prairies and boundless plains, of nameless rivers and colossal hills, a land of dreams, of
romance, of marvellous adventure, he felt strange powers growing within him. It seemed that
in such a place the one who opened his soul to heaven must become endowed with all those singular
gifts he had longed for. He looked confidently forward to the time when they should regard
him as a man who could work miracles.

At the head of Grand Island they came to vast herds of buffalo--restless brown seas of humped,
shaggy backs and fiercely lowered heads. In their first efforts to slay these they shot them
full in the forehead, and were dismayed to find that their bullets rebounded harmlessly. They
solved the mystery later, discovering the hide on the skull of a dead bull to be an inch thick
and covered with a mat of gnarled hair in itself almost a shield against bullets. Joel Rae,
with the divine right of youth, drew for them from this circumstance an instructive parallel.

So was the head of their own church protected against Gentile shafts by the hide of righteousness
and the matted hair of faith.

The Indians killed buffalo by riding close and striking them with an arrow at the base of the
spine; whereupon the beast would fall paralysed, to be hamstrung at leisure. Only by some such
infernal strategy, the young Elder assured them, could the Gentiles ever henceforth cast them down.

For many days their way lay through these herds of buffalo--herds so far-reaching that none
could count their numbers or even see their farther line, lost in the distance over the swell
of the plains. Often their way was barred until a herd would pass, making the earth tremble,
and with a noise like muffled thunder. They waited gladly, feeling that these were obstacles
on the way to Zion.

Thus far it had been a land of moderate plenty, one in which they were, at least, not compelled
to look to Heaven for manna. Besides the buffalo which the hunters learned to kill, they found
deer, antelope, great flocks of geese and splendid bronzed wild turkeys. Even the truculent
grizzly came to be numbered among their trophies.

Day after day marched the bearded host,--farmers with ploughs, mechanics with tools, builders,
craftsmen, woodsmen, all the needed factors of a colony, led by the greatest coloniser of modern
times, their one great aim being to make ready some spot in the wilderness for the second advent
of the Messiah. All about them was the prairie, its long grass gently billowed by the spring
breeze. On the far right, blue in the haze, was a continuous range of lofty bluffs. On the
left the waters of the Platte, muddied by the spring freshets, flowed over beds of quicksand
between groves of cottonwood that pleasantly fringed its banks. The hard labour and the constant
care demanded by the dangers that surrounded them prevented any from feeling the monotony of
the landscape.

Besides the regular trials of the march there were wagons to be "snaked" across the streams,
tires to be reset and yokes to be mended at each "lay-by," strayed stock to be hunted, and
a thousand contingencies sufficient to drive from their minds all but the one thought that
they had been thrown forth from a Christian land for the offence of worshipping God according
to the dictates of their own consciences.

Joel Rae, walking beside his wagon, meditated chiefly upon the manner in which his Witness
would first manifest itself. The wonder came, in a way, while he thus meditated. Late one afternoon
the scouts thrown in advance came hurrying back to report a large band of Indians strung out
in battle array a few miles ahead. The wagons were at once formed five abreast, their one cannon
was wheeled to the front, and the company advanced in close formation. Perceiving these aggressive
manoeuvres, the Indians seemed to change their plan and, instead of coming on to attack, were
seen to be setting fire to the prairie.

The result might well have been disastrous, as the wind was blowing toward the train. Joel
Rae saw it; saw that the time had come for a miracle if the little company of Saints was to
be saved a serious rebuff. He quickly entered his wagon and began to pray. He prayed that the
Lord might avert this calamity and permit the handful of faithful ones to proceed in peace
to fashion His temple on earth.

When he began to pray there had been outside a woful confusion of sounds,--scared and plunging
horses, bellowing oxen, excited men shouting to the stock and to one another, the barking of
dogs and the rattling of the wagons. Through this din he prayed, scarcely hearing his own voice,
yet feeling within himself the faith that he knew must prevail. And then as he prayed he became
conscious that these noises had subsided to a wonderful silence. A moment this lasted, and
then he heard it broken by a mighty shout of gladness, followed by excited calls from one man
to another.

He looked out in calm certainty to observe in what manner the Lord had consented to answer
his petition. He saw that the wind had veered and, even as he looked, large drops of rain came
pounding musically upon his wagon-cover. Far in front of them a long, low line of flame was
crawling to the west, while above it lurid clouds of smoke rolled away from them. In another
moment the full force of the shower was upon them from a sky that half an hour before had been
cloudless. Far off to the right scurried the Indians, their feathery figures lying low upon
the backs of their small ponies. His heart swelled within him, and he fell again to his knees
with many earnest words of thanksgiving for the intercession.

They at once made camp for the night, and by Brigham's fire later in the evening Joel Rae confided
the truth of his miracle to that good man, taking care not to utter the words with any delight
or pride in himself. He considered that Brigham was unduly surprised by the occurrence; almost
displeased in fact; showing a tendency to attribute the day's good fortune to phenomena wholly
natural. Although the miracle had seemed to him a small, simple thing, he now felt a little
ashamed of his performance. He was pleased to note, however, that Brigham became more gracious
to him after a short period of reflection. He praised him indeed for the merit which he seemed
to have gained in the Lord's sight; taking occasion to remind him, however, that he, Brigham,
had meant to produce the same effects by a prayer of his own in due time to save the train
from destruction; that he had chosen to wait, however, in order to try the faith of the Saints.

"As a matter of fact, Brother Joel," he concluded, "I don't know as there is any limit to the
power with which the Lord has blessed me. I tell you I feel equal to any miracle--even to raising
the dead, I sometimes think--I feel that fired up with the Holy Ghost!"

"I am sure you will do even that, Brother Brigham." And the young man's eyes swam with mingled
gratitude and admiration. He resolved in his wagon that night, that when the time came for
another miracle, he would not selfishly usurp the honour of performing it. He would not again
forestall the able Brigham.

By the first of June they had wormed their way over five hundred miles of plain to the trading
post of Fort Laramie. Here they were at last forced to cross the Platte and to take up their
march along the Oregon trail. They were now in the land of alkaline deserts, of sage-brush
and greasewood, of sad, bleak, deadly stretches; a land where the favour of Heaven might have
to be called upon if they were to survive. Yet it was a land not without inspiration,--a land
of immense distances, of long, dim perspectives, and of dreamy visions in the far, vague haze.
In such a land, thought Joel Rae, the spirit of the Lord must draw closer to the children of
earth. In such a land no miracle should be too difficult. And so it came that he was presently
enabled to put in Brigham's way the opportunity of performing a work of mercy which he himself
would have been glad to do, but for the fear of affronting the Prophet.

A band of mounted Sioux had met them one day with friendly advances and stopped to trade. Among
the gaudy warriors Joel Rae's attention was called to a boy who had lost an arm. He made inquiries,
and found him to be the son of the chief. The chief himself made it plain to Joel that the
young man had lost his arm ten moons before in a combat with a grizzly bear. Whereupon the
young Elder cordially bade the chief bring his crippled son to their own great chief, who would,
by the gracious power of God, miraculously restore the missing member.

A few moments later the three were before Brigham, who was standing by his wagon; Joel Rae,
glowing with a glad and confident serenity; the tawny chief with his sable braids falling each
side of his painted face, gay in his head-dress of dyed eagle plumes, his buckskin shirt jewelled
with blue beads and elk's teeth, warlike with his bow and steel-pointed arrows; and the young
man, but little less ornate than his splendid father, stoical, yet scarce able to subdue the
flash of hope in his eyes as he looked up to the great white chief.

Brigham looked at them questioningly. Joel announced their errand.

"It's a rare opportunity, Brother Brigham, to bring light to these wretched Lamanites. This
boy had his arm torn off a year ago in a fight with a grizzly. You know you told me that day
I brought the rain-storm that you could well-nigh raise the dead, so this will be easy for you."

Brigham still looked puzzled, so the young man added with a flash of enthusiasm: "Restore this
poor creature's arm and the noise of the miracle will go all through these tribes;" he paused
expectantly.

It is the mark of true greatness that it may never be found unprepared. Now and again it may
be made to temporise for a moment, cunningly adopting one expedient or another to hide its
unreadiness--but never more than briefly.

Brigham had looked slowly from the speaker to the Indians and slowly back again. Then he surveyed
several bystanders who had been attracted to the group, and his eyelids were seen to work rapidly,
as if in sympathetic pace with his thoughts. Then all at once he faced Joel.

"Brother Rae, have you reflected about this?"

"Why--Brother Brigham--no--not reflected--perhaps if we both prayed with hearts full of faith,
the Lord might--"

"Brother Rae!"

There was sternness in the voice now, and the young man trembled before the Lion of the Lord.

"You mistake me. I guess I'm a good enough servant of the Lord, so my own prayer would restore
this arm without any of your help; yes, I guess the Lord and me could do it without you--if
we thought it was best. Now pay attention. Do you believe in the resurrection of the body?"

"I do, Brother Brigham, and of course I didn't mean to"--he was blushing now.

"Do you believe the day of judgment is at hand?"

"I do."

"How near?"

"You and our priests and Elders say it will come in 1870."

"Correct! How many years is that from now?"

"Twenty-three, Brother Brigham."

"Yes, twenty-three. Now then, how many years are there to be after that?"

"How many--surely an eternity!"

"More than twenty-three years, then--much more?"

"Eternity means endless time."

"Oh, it does, does it?"

There had been gradually sounding in his voice a ring of triumph which now became distinct.

"Well, then, answer me this--and remember it shall be as you say to the best of my influence
with the Lord--you shall be responsible for this poor remnant of the seed of Cain. Now, don't
be rash! Is it better for this poor creature to continue with his one arm here for the twenty-three
years the world is to endure, and then pass on to eternity where he will have his two arms
forever; or, do you want me to renew his arm now and let him go through eternity a freak, a
monstrosity? Do you want him to suffer a little inconvenience these few days he has here, or
do you want him to go through an endless hereafter with three arms?"

The young man gazed at him blankly with a dropped jaw.

"Come, what do you say? I'm full of faith. Shall I--"

"No--no, Brother Brigham; don't--for God's sake, don't! Of course he would be resurrected with
three arms. You think of everything, Brother Brigham!"

The Indians had meanwhile been growing puzzled and impatient. He now motioned them to follow him.

By dint of many crude efforts in the sign language and an earnest use of the few words known
to both, he succeeded, after a long time, in putting the facts before the chief and his son;
They, after an animated conversation, succeeded with much use of the sign language in conveying
to Joel Rae the information that the young man was not at all dismayed by the prospect of having
three arms during the next life. He gathered, indeed, that both father and son would be rather
elated than otherwise by this circumstance, seeming to suspect that the extra member must confer
superior prowess and high distinction upon its possessor.

But he shook his head with much determination, and refused to take them again before the great
white chief. The thought troubled him exceedingly and would not be gone--yet he knew not how
to account for it--that Brigham would not receive this novel view of the matter with any cordiality.

When they were camped that night, Brigham made a suggestion to him.

"Brother Rae, it ain't just the best plan in the world to come on a man sudden that way for
so downright a miracle. A man can't be always fired up with the Holy Ghost, with all the cares
of this train on his mind. You come and have a private talk with me beforehand after this,
when you got a miracle you want done."

He prayed more fervently than ever that night to be made "wise and good like thy servant Brigham"--also
for the gift of tongues to come upon him so that he might instruct the Indians in the threefold
character of the Godhead and in other matters pertaining to their salvation.

CHAPTER X.

The Promised Land

So far on their march the Lord had protected them from all but ordinary hardships. Again, the
most of them were for many weeks without bread, saving for the sick the little flour they had
and subsisting upon the meat provided by the hunters. Before reaching Fort Laramie, too, their
stock had become weakened for want of food; an extended drought, the vast herds of buffalo,
and the Indian fires having combined to destroy the pasturage.

This weakness of the animals made the march for many days not more than five or six miles a
day. At the last they had fed to the stock not only all their grain but the most of their crackers
and other breadstuffs. But these were slight matters to a persecuted people gathering out of
Babylon.

Late in June they reached the South Pass. For many hundred miles they had been climbing the
backbone of the continent. Now they had reached the summit, the dividing ridge between streams
that flowed to the Atlantic and streams that flowed to the Pacific. From the level prairies
they had toiled up into the fearsome Rockies where bleak, grim crags lowered upon them from
afar, and distant summits glistening with snow warned them of the perils ahead.

Through all this time of marching the place where they should pitch the tent of Israel was
not fixed upon. When Brigham was questioned around the camp-fire at night, his only reply was
that he would know the site of their new home when he saw it. And it came to be told among
the men that he had beheld in vision a tent settling down from heaven and resting over a certain
spot; and that a voice had said to him, "Here is the place where my people Israel shall pitch
their tents and spread wide the curtains of Zion!" It was enough. He would recognise the spot
when they reached it.

From the trappers, scouts, and guides encountered along the road they had received much advice
as to eligible locations; and while this was various as to sites recommended, the opinion had
been unanimous that the Salt Lake Valley was impossible. It was, they were told, sandy, barren,
rainless, destitute of timber and vegetation, infested with hordes of hungry crickets, and
roamed over by bands of the most savage Indians. In short, no colony could endure there.

One by one the trappers they met voiced this opinion. There was Bordeaux, the grizzled old
Frenchman, clad in ragged buckskin; Moses Harris; "Pegleg" Smith, whose habit of profanity
was shocking; Miles Goodyear, fresh from captivity among the Blackfeet; and James Bridger.
The latter had discovered Great Salt Lake twenty-five years before, and was especially vehement
in his condemnation of the valley. They had halted a day at his "fort," two adjoining log houses
with dirt roofs, surrounded by a high stockade of logs, and built on one of several small islands
formed by the branches of Black's Fork. Here they had found the old trapper amid a score of
nondescript human beings, white men, Indian women, and half-breed children.

Bridger had told them very concisely that he would pay them a thousand dollars for the first
ear of corn raised in Salt Lake Valley. It is true that Bridger seemed to have become pessimistic
in many matters. For one, the West was becoming overcrowded and the price of furs was falling
at a rate to alarm the most conservative trapper. He referred feelingly to the good old days
when one got ten dollars a pound for prime beaver skins in St. Louis; but "now it's a skin
for a plug of tobacco, and three for a cup of powder, and other fancies in the same proportion."
And so, had his testimony been unsupported, they might have suspected he was underestimating
the advantages of the Salt Lake Valley. But, corroborated as he had been by his brother trappers,
they began to descend the western slope of the Rockies strong in the opinion that this same
Salt Lake Valley was the land that had been chosen for them by the Lord.

They dared not, indeed, go to a fertile land, for there the Gentiles would be tempted to follow
them--with the old bloody end. Only in a desert such as these men had described the Salt Lake
Valley to be could they hope for peace. From Fort Bridger, then, their route bent to the southwest
along the rocky spurs of the Uintah Mountains, whose snow-clad tops gleamed a bluish white
in the July sun.

By the middle of July the vanguard of the company began the descent of Echo Cañon,--a narrow
slit cut straight down a thousand feet into the red sandstone,--the pass which a handful of
them was to hold a few years later against a whole army of the hated Gentiles.

The hardest part of their journey was still before them. Their road had now to be made as they
went, lying wholly among the mountains. Lofty hills, deep ravines with jagged sides, forbidding
cañons, all but impassable streams, rock-bound and brush-choked,--up and down, through or over
all these obstacles they had now to force a passage, cutting here, digging there; now double-locking
the wheels of their wagons to prevent their crashing down some steep incline; now putting five
teams to one load to haul it up the rock-strewn side of some water-way.

From Echo Cañon they went down the Weber, then toward East Cañon, a dozen of the bearded host
going forward with spades and axes as sappers. Sometimes they made a mile in five hours; sometimes
they were less lucky. But at length they were fighting their way up the choked East Cañon,
starting fierce gray wolves from their lairs in the rocks and hearing at every rod of their
hard-fought way the swift and unnerving song of the coiled rattlesnake.

Eight fearful miles they toiled through this gash in the mountain; then over another summit,--Big
Mountain; down this dangerous slide, all wheels double-locked, on to the summit of another
lofty hill,--Little Mountain; and abruptly down again into the rocky gorge afterwards to become
historic as Immigration Cañon.

Following down this gorge, never doubting they should come at last to their haven, they found
its mouth to be impassable. Rocks, brush, and timber choked the way. Crossing to the south
side, they went sheerly up the steep hill--so steep that it was all but impossible for the
straining animals to drag up the heavy wagons, and so narrow that a false step might have dashed
wagon and team half a thousand feet on to the rocks below.

But at last they stood on the summit,--and broke into shouts of rapture as they looked. For
the wilderness home of Israel had been found. Far and wide below them stretched their promised
land,--a broad, open valley hemmed in by high mountains that lay cold and far and still in
the blue haze. Some of these had slept since the world began under their canopies of snow,
and these flashed a sunlit glory into the eager eyes of the pilgrims. Others reared bare, scathed
peaks above slopes that were shaggy with timber. And out in front lay the wondrous lake,--a
shield of deepest glittering turquois held to the dull, gray breast of the valley.

Again and again they cried out, "Hosanna to God and the Lamb!" and many of the bearded host
shed tears, for the hardships of the way had weakened them.

Then Brigham came, lying pale and wasted in his wagon, and when they saw him gaze long, and
heard him finally say, "Enough--drive on!" they knew that on this morning of July 24, 1847,
they had found the spot where in vision he had seen the tent of the Lord come down to earth.

Joel Rae had waited with a beating heart for Brigham's word of confirmation, and when he heard
it his soul was filled to overflowing. He knew that here the open vision would enfold him;
here the angel of the Lord would come to him fetching his great Witness. Here he would rise
to immeasurable zeniths of spirituality. And here his people would become a mighty people of
the Lord. He foresaw the hundred unwalled cities that Brigham was to found, and the green gardens
that were to make the now desert valley a fit setting for the temple of God. Here was a stricken
Rachel, a barren Sarah to be transformed by the touch of the Saints to a mother of many children.
Here would the lambs of the Lord be safe at last from the Gentile wolves--safe for a time at
least, until so long as it might take the Lions of the Lord to come to their growth. And that
was to be no indefinite period; for had not Brigham just said, with a snap of his great jaws
and a cold flash of his blue eyes, "Let us alone ten years here, and we'll ask no odds of Uncle
Sam or the Devil!"

There on the summit they knelt to entreat the mercy of God upon the land. The next day, by
their leader's direction, they consecrated the valley to the Lord, and planted six acres of
potatoes.

CHAPTER XI.

Another Miracle and a Temptation in the Wilderness

The floor of the valley was an arid waste, flat and treeless, a far sweep of gray and gold,
of sage-brush spangled with sunflowers, patched here and there with glistening beds of salt
and soda, or pools of the deadly alkali. Here crawled the lizard and the rattlesnake; and there
was no music to the desolation save the petulant chirp of the cricket. At the sides an occasional
stream tumbled out of the mountains to be all but drunk away at once by the thirsty sands.
Along the banks of these was the only green to be found, sparse fringes of willow and wild
rose. On the borders of the valley, where the steeps arose, were little patches of purple and
dusty brown, oak-bush, squaw-berry, a few dwarfed cedars, and other scant growths. At long
intervals could be found a marsh of wire-grass, or a few acres of withered bunch-grass. But
these served only to emphasise the prevailing desert tones.

The sun-baked earth was so hard that it broke their ploughs when they tried to turn it. Not
until they had spread water upon it from the river they had named Jordan could the ploughs
be used. Such was the new Canaan, the land held in reserve by the Lord for His chosen people
since the foundations of the world were laid.

Dreary though it was, they were elated. Had not a Moses led them out of bondage up into this
chamber of the mountains against the day of wrath that was to consume the Gentile world? And
would he not smite the rocks for water? Would he not also be a Joshua to sit in judgment and
divide to Israel his inheritance?

They waited not nor demurred, but fell to work. Within a week they had explored the valley
and its cañons, made a road to the timber eight miles away, built a saw-pit, sawed lumber for
a skiff, ploughed, planted, and irrigated half a hundred acres of the parched soil, and begun
the erection of many dwellings, some of logs, some of adobes. Ground had also been chosen and
consecrated by Brigham, whereon, in due time, they would build up their temple to the God of Jacob.

Meantime, they would continue to gather out of Babylon. During the late summer and fall many
wagons arrived from the Missouri, so that by the beginning of winter their number was nearly
two thousand. They lived rudely, a lucky few in the huts they had built; more in tents and
wagon-boxes. Nor did they fail to thank Providence for the mild winter vouchsafed to them during
this unprotected period, permitting them not only to survive, but to continue their labours--of
logging, home-building, the making of rough furniture, and the repairing of wagons and tools.

When the early spring came they were again quickly at the land with their seeds. Over five
thousand acres were sown to needful produce. When this began to sprout with every promise of
a full harvest, their joy was boundless; for their stock of breadstuffs and provisions had
fallen low during the winter, and could not last later than harvest-time, even with rigid economy.

But early in June, in the full flush of this springtide of promise, it appeared that the Lord
was minded to chasten them. For into their broad, green fields came the ravenous crickets in
wide, black streams down the mountain sides. Over the growing grain they spread as a pall,
and the tender sprouts were consumed to the ground. In their track they left no stalk nor growing
blade.

Starvation now faced the Saints. In their panic they sought to fight the all-devouring pest.
While some went wildly through the fields killing the crickets, others ran trenches and tried
to drown them. Still others beat them back with sticks and brooms, or burned them by fires
set in the fields. But against the oncoming horde these efforts were unavailing. Where hundreds
were destroyed hundreds of thousands appeared.

Despair seized the Saints, the bitter despair of a cheated, famished people--deluded even by
their God. In their shorn fields they wept and cursed, knowing at last they could not stay
the pest.

Then into the fields came Joel Rae, rebuking the frenzied men and women. The light of a high
faith was upon him as he called out to them:

"Have I not preached to you all winter the way to salvation in times like this? Does faith
mean one thing in my mouth and another thing here? Why waste yourselves with those foolish
tricks of fire and water? They only make you forget Jehovah--you fools--you poor, blind fools--to
palter so!"

He raised his voice, and the wondering group about him grew large.

"Down, down on your knees and pray--pray--pray! I tell you the Lord shall not suffer you to
perish!"

Then, as but one or two obeyed him--

"So your hearts have been hardened? Then my own prayer shall save you!"

Down he knelt in the midst of the group, while they instinctively drew back from him on all
sides. But as his voice rose, a voice that had never failed to move them, they, too, began
to kneel, at first those near him, then others back of them, until a hundred knelt about him.

He had not observed them, but with eyes closed he prayed on, pouring out his heart in penitent
supplication.

"These people are but little children, after all, seeing not, groping blindly, attempting weakly,
blundering always, yet never faltering in love for Thee. Now I, Thy servant, humble and lowly,
from whom Thou hast already taken in hardest ways all that his heart held dear, who will to-day
give his body to be crucified, if need be, for this people--I implore Thee to save these blundering
children now, in this very moment. I ask nothing for myself but that--"

As his words rang out, there had been quick, low, startled murmurs from the kneeling group
about him; and now loud shouts interrupted his prayer. He opened his eyes. From off toward
the lake great flocks of gulls had appeared, whitening the sky, and now dulling all other sounds
with the beating of their wings and their high, plaintive cries. Quickly they settled upon
the fields in swirling drifts, so that the land all about lay white as with snow.

A groan went up,--"They will finish what the crickets have left."

He had risen to his feet, looking intently. Then he gave an exultant shout.

"No! No!--they are eating only the crickets!--the white birds are devouring the black pests;
the hosts of heaven and hell have met, and the powers of light have triumphed once more over
darkness! Pray--pray now with all your hearts in thanksgiving for this mercy!"

And again they knelt, many with streaming eyes, while he led them in a prayer of gratitude
for this wondrous miracle.

All day long the white birds fed upon the crickets, and when they left at night the harvest
had been saved. Thus had Heaven vouchsafed a second miracle to the Lute of the Holy Ghost.
It is small wonder then if his views of the esteem in which he was held by that power were
now greatly enlarged.

In August, thanks to the Heaven-sent gulls, they were able to celebrate with a feast their
first "Harvest Home." In the centre of the big stockade a bowery was built, and under its shade
tables were spread and richly laden with the first fruits their labours had won from the desert,--white
bread and golden butter, green corn, watermelons, and many varieties of vegetables. Hoisted
on poles for exhibition were immense sheaves of wheat, rye, barley, and oats, coaxed from the
arid level with the water they had cunningly spread upon it.

There were prayers and public thanksgiving, songs and speeches and dancing. It was the flush
of their first triumph over the desert. Until nightfall the festival lasted, and at its close
Elder Rae stood up to address them on the subject of their past trials and present blessings.
The silence was instant, and the faces were all turned eagerly upon him, for it was beginning
to be suspected that he had more than even priestly power.

"To-day," he said, "the favour and blessing of God have been manifest upon us. But let us not
forget our debts and duties in this feasting of the flesh. Afflictions are necessary to humble
and prove us, and we shall have them as often as they are needed. Oh, never doubt it! I have,
indeed, but one fear concerning this people in the valleys of the mountains--but one trembling
fear in the nerves of my spirit--and that is lest we do not live the religion we profess. If
we will only cleave to that faith in our practise, I tell you we are at the defiance of all
hell. But if we transgress the law God has given us, and trample His mercies, blessings, and
ordinances under our feet, treating them with the indifference I have thought some occasionally
do, not realising their sins, I tell you that in consequence we shall be overcome, and the
Lord will let us be again smitten and scattered. Take it to heart. May the God of heaven fill
you with the Holy Ghost and give you light and joy in His Kingdom."

When he was done many pressed forward to take his hand, the young and the old, for they had
both learned to reverence him.

Near the outer edge of the throng was a red-lipped Juno, superbly rounded, who had gleaned
in the fields until she was all a Gipsy brown, and her movements of a Gipsy grace in their
freeness. She did not greet the young Elder as did the others, seeming, indeed, to be unconscious
of his presence. Yet she lingered near as they scattered off into the dusk, in little groups
or one by one; and still she stood there when all were gone, now venturing just a glance at
him from deep gray eyes set under black brows, turning her splendid head a little to bring
him into view. He saw the figure and came forward, peeringly.

"Mara Cavan--yes, yes, so it is!" He took her hand, somewhat timidly, an observer would have
said. "Your father is not able to be out? I shall walk down with you to see him--if you're
ready now."

She had been standing much like a statue, in guarded restraint, but at his words and the touch
of his hand she seemed to melt and flow into eager acquiescence, murmuring some hurried little
words of thanks for her father, and stepping by his side with eyes down.

They went out into the soft summer night, past the open doors where rejoicing groups still
lingered, the young standing, the old sitting in chairs by the doors of their huts. Then they
were out of the stockade and off toward the southern end of the settlement. A big, golden moon
had come up over the jagged edge of the eastern hills,--a moon that left the valley in a mystic
sheen of gold and blue, and threw their shadows madly into one as they walked. They heard the
drowsy chirp of the cricket, now harmless, and the low cry of an owl. They felt the languorous
warmth of the night, spiced with a hint of chilliness, and they felt each other near. They
had felt this nearness before. One of them had learned to fear it, to tremble for himself at
the thought of it. The other had learned to dream of it, and to long for it, and to wonder
why it should be denied.

Now, as they stepped side by side, their hands brushed together, and he caught hers in his
grasp, turning to look full upon her. Her ecstasy was poignant; she trembled in her walk. But
she looked straight ahead,--waiting. To both of them it seemed that the earth rocked under
their feet. He looked long at her profile, softened in the magic light. She felt his eyes upon
her, and still she waited, in a trembling ecstasy, stepping closely by his side. She felt him
draw a long breath, and then another, quickly,--and then he spoke.

In words that were well-chosen but somewhat hurried, he proceeded to instruct her in the threefold
character of the Godhead. The voice at first was not like his own, but as he went on it grew
steadier. After she drew her hand gently out of his, which she presently did, it seemed to
regain its normal pitch and calmness.

He saw her to the door of the cabin on the outskirts of the settlement, and there he spoke
a few words of cheer to her ailing father.

Then he was off into the desert, pacing swiftly into the grim, sandy solitude beyond the farthest
cabin light and the bark of the outmost watch-dog. Feverishly he walked, and far, until at
last, as if naught in himself could avail, he threw himself to the ground and prayed.

"Keep me good! Keep me to my vows! Help me till my own strength grows, for I am weak and wanting.
Let me endure the pain until this wicked fire within me hath burned itself out. Keep me for her!"

Back where the houses were, in the shadow of one of them, was the flushed, full-breathing woman,
hurt but dumb, wondering, in her bruised tenderness, why it must be so.

Still farther back, inside the stockade, where the gossiping groups yet lingered, they were
saying it was strange that Elder Rae waited so long to take him a wife or two.

CHAPTER XII.

A Fight for Life

The stream of Saints to the Great Basin had become well-nigh continuous--Saints of all degrees
of prosperity, from Parley Pratt, the Archer of Paradise, with his wealth of wives, wagons,
and cattle, to Barney Bigler, unblessed with wives or herds, who put his earthly goods on a
wheelbarrow, and, to the everlasting glory of God, trundled it from the Missouri River to the
valley of the Great Salt Lake. Train after train set out for the new Zion with faith that God
would drop manna before them.

Each train was a little migrating State in itself. And never was the natural readiness of the
American pioneer more luminously displayed. At every halt of the wagons a shoemaker would be
seen searching for a lapstone; a gunsmith would be mending a rifle, and weavers would be at
their wheels or looms. The women early discovered that the jolting wagons would churn their
cream to butter; and for bread, very soon after the halt was made, the oven hollowed out of
the hillside was heated, and the dough, already raised, was in to bake.

Nor did the marches ever cease to be fraught with peril and, hardship. There were tempests,
droughts, famines, stampedes of the stock, prairie fires, and Indian forays. Hundreds of miles
across the plain and through the mountains the Indians would trail after them, like sharks
in the wake of a ship, tirelessly watching, waiting for the right moment to stampede the stock,
to fire the prairie, or to descend upon stragglers.

One by one the trains worked down into the valley, the tired Saints making fresh their covenants
by rebaptism as they came. And from these waters of baptism the purified Saints went to their
inheritances in Zion--took their humble places, and began to sweat and bleed in the upbuilding
of the new Jerusalem.

From a high, tented wagon in one such train, creaking its rough way down Emigration Cañon,
with straining oxen and tired but eager people, there had leaped one late afternoon the girl
whose eyes were to call to him so potently,--incomparable eyes, large and deep, of a velvety
grayness, under black brows splendidly bent. Nor had the eyes alone voiced that call to his
starved senses. He had caught the free, fearless confidence of her leap over the wheel, and
her graceful abandon as she stood there, finely erect and full-curved, her head with its Greek
lines thrown well back, and her strong hands raised to readjust the dusky hair that tumbled
about her head like a storm-cloud.

Men from the train were all about, and others from the settlement, and these spoke to her,
some in serious greeting, some with jesting words. She returned it all in good part without
embarrassment,--even the sally of the winking wag who called out, "Now then, Mara Cavan! Here
we are, and a girl like yourself ought to catch an Elder, at the very lowest."

She laughed with easy good-nature, still fumbling in the dusk of blown hair at the back of
her head, showing a full-lipped mouth, beautifully large, with strong-looking, white teeth.
"I'll catch never a one myself, if you please, Nathan Tanner! I'll do no catching at all, now!
I'm the one will have to be caught!"

Her voice was a contralto, with the little hint of roughness that made it warm and richly golden;
that made it fall, indeed, upon the ears of the listening Elder like a cathedral chime calling
him to forget all and worship--forget all but that he was five and twenty with the hot blood
surging and crowding and crying out in his veins.

Now, having a little subdued the tossing storm-cloud of hair, she stood with one hand upon
her hip and the other shading her eyes, looking intently into the streets of the new settlement.
And again there was bantering jest from the men about, and the ready, careless response from
her, with gestures of an impishly reckless unconcern, of a full readiness to give and take
in easy good-fellowship. But then, in the very midst of a light response to one of the bantering
men, her gray eyes met for the first time the very living look of the young Elder standing
near. She was at once confused, breaking off her speech with an awkward laugh, and looking
down. But, his eyes keeping steadily upon her, she, as if defiantly, returned his look for
a fluttering second, trying to make her eyes survey him slowly from head to foot with her late
cool carelessness; but she had to let them fall again, and he saw the colour come under the
clear skin.

He knew by these tokens that he possessed a power over this splendid woman that none of the
other men could wield,--she had lowered her eyes to no other but him--and all the man in him
sang exultantly under the knowledge. He greeted her father, the little Seumas Cavan of indomitable
spirit, fresh, for all his march of a thousand miles, and he welcomed them both to Zion. Again
and again while he talked to them he caught quick glances from the wonderful eyes;--glances
of interest, of inquiry,--now of half-hearted defiance, now of wondering submission.

The succeeding months had been a time of struggle with him--a struggle to maintain his character
of Elder after the Order of Melchisedek in the full gaze of those velvety gray eyes, and in
the light of her reckless, full-lipped smile; to present to the temptress a shield of austere
piety which her softest glances should not avail to melt. For something in her manner told
him that she divined all his weakness; that, if she acknowledged his power over her, she recognised
her own power over him, a power equal to and justly balancing the other. Even when he discoursed
from the pulpit, his glance would fasten upon hers, as if there were but the one face before
him instead of a thousand, and he knew that she mocked him in her heart; knew she divined there
was that within him which strongly would have had her and himself far away--alone.

Nor was the girl's own mind all of a piece. For, if she flaunted herself before him, as if
with an impish resolve to be his undoing, there were still times when he awed her by his words
of fire, and by his high, determined stand in some circle to which she knew she could never
mount. That night when he walked with her in the moonlight, she knew he had trembled on the
edge of the gulf fixed so mysteriously between them. She had even felt herself leaning over
to draw him down with her own warm arms; and then all at once he had strangely moved away,
widening this mysterious gulf that always separated them, leaving her solitary, hurt, and wondering.
She could not understand it. Life called through them so strongly. How could he breast the
mighty rush? And why, why must it be so?

During the winter that now came upon them, it became even a greater wonder to her; for it was
a time when all of them were drawn closer in a common suffering--a time of dark days which
she felt they might have lightened for each other, and a time when she knew that more than
ever she drew him.

For hardly had the feast of the Harvest Home gone by when food once more became scarce. The
heaven-sent gulls had, after all, saved but half a crop. Drought and early frost had diminished
this; and those who came in from the East came all too trustingly with empty meal-sacks.

By the beginning of winter there were five thousand people in the valley to be fed with miraculous
loaves and fishes. Half of these were without decent shelter, dwelling under wagon-covers or
in flimsy tents, and forced much of the time to be without fuel; for wood had to be hauled
through the snow from the distant cañons, and so was precious stuff. For three months the cutting
winds came down from the north, and the pitiless winter snows raged about them. An inventory
was early taken of the food-stuffs, and thereafter rations were issued alike to all, whether
rich or poor. Otherwise many of the latter must have perished. It was a time of hard expedients,
such as men are content to face only for the love of God. They ranged the hills and benches
to dig sego and thistle roots, and in the last days of winter many took the rawhides from their
roofs, boiling and eating them. When spring came, they watched hungrily for the first green
vegetation, which they gathered and cooked. Truly it seemed they had stopped in a desert as
cruel in its way as the human foes from whom they had fled.

It was now that the genius of their leader showed. He was no longer Brigham Young, the preacher,
but a father in Israel to his starving children. When prayers availed not for a miracle, his
indomitable spirit saved them. Starvation was upon them and nakedness to the blast; yet when
they desponded or complained, the Lion of the Lord was there to check them. He scolded, pleaded,
threatened, roared prophecies, and overcame them, silencing every murmur. He made them work,
and worked himself, a daily example before them of tireless energy. He told them what to do,
and how, both for their material salvation and their spiritual; when to haul wood, and how
to distinguish between false and true spirits; how to thatch roofs and in what manner the resurrection
would occur; how to cook thistle roots to best advantage, and how God was man made perfect;
he reminded them of the day of wrath, and told them mirthful anecdotes to make them laugh.
He pictured God's anger upon the sinful, and encouraged them to dance and to make merry; instructed
them in the mysteries of the Kingdom and instigated theatrical performances to distract their
minds. He was bland and bullying by turns; affable and gruff; jocose and solemn--always what
he thought their fainting spirits needed. He was feared and loved--feared first. They learned
to dread the iron of his hand and the steel of his heart--the dauntless spirit of him that
left them no longer their own masters, yet kept them loving their bondage. Through the dreadful
cold and famine, the five thousand of them ceased not to pray nor lost their faith--their great
faith that they had been especially favoured of God and were at the last to be saved alone
from the wreck of the world.

The efforts of Brigham to put heart into the people were ably seconded by Joel Rae. He was
loved like Brigham, but not feared. He preached like Brigham submission to the divine will
as interpreted by the priesthood, but he was more extravagant than Brigham in his promises
of blessings in store for them. He never resorted to vagueness in his pictures of what the
Lord was about to do for them. He was literal and circumstantial to a degree that made Brigham
and the older men in authority sometimes writhe in public and chide him in private. They were
appalled at the sweeping victories he promised the Saints over the hated Gentiles at an early
day. They suggested, too, that the Lord might withhold an abundance from them for a few years
until He had more thoroughly tried them. But their counsel seemed only to inflame him to fresh
absurdities. In the very days of their greatest scarcity that winter, when almost every man
was dressed in skins, and the daily fare was thistle roots, he declared to them at a Sunday
service:

"A time of plenty is at hand--of great plenty. I cannot tell you how I know these things. I
do not know how they come to me. I pray--and they come to life in my spirit; that is how I
have found this fact: in less than a year States-goods of all needed kinds will be sold here
cheaper than they can be bought in Eastern cities. You shall have an abundance at prices that
will amaze you."

And the people thrilled to hear him, partaking of his faith, remembering the gulls that ate
the crickets, and the rain and wind that came to save the pioneer train from fire. To the leaders
such prophesying was merely reckless, inviting further chastisements from heaven, and calculated
to cause a loss of faith in the priesthood.

And yet, wild as it was, they saw this latter prophecy fulfilled; for now, so soon after the
birth of this new empire, while it suffered and grew weak and bade fair to perish in its cradle
of faith, there was made for it a golden spoon of plenty.

Over across the mountains the year before, on the decayed granite bed-rock of the tail-race
at the mill of one Sutter, a man had picked up a few particles of gold, the largest as big

As he listened to the man's tale, the truth came to him in a great light. Famine not sufficing,
the Lord was sending this further affliction upon them. He was going to goad them into asserting
and maintaining their independence of his enemies, the Gentiles. The inspiration of this thought
nerved him anew. Though they all died, to the last child, he would live to carry back to Zion
the message that now burned within him. They had temporised with the Gentile and had grown
lax among themselves. They must be aroused to repentance, and God would save him to do the work.

So, when the snow came at last, the final touch of hardship, driving furiously about the unprotected
women and children, putting wild fear into the heart of every man, he remained calm and sure
and defiant. The next morning the snow lay heavily about them, and they had to dig through
it to bury five of their number in one grave. The morning before, they had issued their last
ration of flour. Now he divided among the company a little hard bread they had kept, and waited
in the snow, for they could travel no further without food.

One of their number was sent ahead to bring aid. After a day in which they ate nothing, supplies
reached them from the valley; but now they were so weakened that food could not fortify them
against the extreme cold that had set in. They wrapped themselves in their few poor quilts,
and struggled bravely on into a white, stinging fog of snow. Each morning there were more and
more of them to bury. And even the burial was a mockery, for wolves were digging at the graves
almost before the last debilitated straggler had left the camping-place. The heavy snows continued,
but movement was necessary. Into the white jaws of the beautiful, merciless demon they went.

Among the papers of a man he helped to bury, Joel Rae found a journal that the dead man had
kept until within a few days of his death. By the light of his last candle he read it until
late into the night.

       *       *       *       *       *

"The weather grew colder each day; and many got their feet so badly frozen that they could
not walk and had to be lifted from place to place. Some got their fingers frozen; others their
ears; and one woman lost her sight by the frost. These severities of the weather also increased
our number of deaths, so that we buried several each day.

"The day we crossed the Rocky Ridge it was snowing a little--the wind hard from the northwest,
and blowing so keenly that it almost pierced us through. We had to wrap ourselves closely in
blankets, quilts, or whatever else we could get, to keep from freezing. Elder Rae this day
appointed me to bring up the rear. My duty was to stay behind everything and see that nobody
was left along the road. I had to bury a man who had died in my hundred, and I finished doing
so after the company had started. In about half an hour I set out on foot alone to do my duty
as rear-guard to the camp. The ascent of the ridge commenced soon after leaving camp, and I
had not gone far up it before I overtook the carts that the folks could not pull through the
snow, here about knee-deep. I helped them along, and we soon overtook another. By all hands
getting to one cart we could travel; so we moved one of the carts a few rods, and then went
back and brought up the others. After moving in this way for awhile, we overtook other carts
at different points of the hill, until we had six carts, not one of which could be moved by
the parties owning it. I put our collective strength to three carts at a time, took them a
short distance, and then brought up the other three. Thus by travelling over the hill three
times--twice forward and once back--I succeeded after hours of toil in bringing my little company
to the summit. The carts were then trotted on gaily down-hill, the intense cold stirring us
to action.

"One or two parties who were with these carts gave up entirely, and but for the fact that we
overtook one of our ox-teams that had been detained on the road, they must have perished on
the Rocky Ridge. One old man named James, a farmer from Gloucestershire, who had a large family,
and who had worked very hard all the way, I found sitting by the roadside unable to pull his
cart any farther. I could not get him into the wagon, as it was already overcrowded. He had
a shotgun, which he had brought from England, and which had been a great blessing to him and
his family, for he was a good shot, and often had a mess of sage-hens or rabbits for his family.
I took the gun from his cart, put a bundle on the end of it, placed it on his shoulder, and
started him out with his little boy, twelve years old. His wife and two daughters, older than
the boy, took the cart along finely after reaching the summit.

"We travelled along with the ox-team and overtook others, all so laden with the sick and helpless
that they moved very slowly. The oxen had almost given out. Some of our folks with carts went
ahead of the team, for where the roads were good they could out-travel oxen; but we constantly
overtook stragglers, some with carts, some without, who had been unable to keep pace with the
body of the company. We struggled along in this weary way until after dark, and by this time
our rear numbered three wagons, eight hand-carts, and nearly forty persons.

"With the wagons were Millen Atwood, Levi Savage, and William Woodward, captains of hundreds,
faithful men who had worked all the way. We finally came to a stream of water which was frozen
over. We could not see where the company had crossed. If at the point where we struck the creek,
then it had frozen over since they passed it. We started one team across, but the oxen broke
through the ice, and would not go over. No amount of shouting and whipping could induce them
to stir an inch. We were afraid to try the other teams, for even could they cross, we could
not leave the one in the creek and go on.

"There was no wood in the vicinity, so we could make no fire, and we were uncertain what to
do. We did not know the distance to the camp, but supposed it to be three or four miles. After
consulting about it, we resolved that some one should go on foot to the camp to inform the
captain of our situation. I was selected to perform the duty, and I set out with all speed.
In crossing the creek I slipped through the ice and got my feet wet, my boots being nearly
worn out. I had not gone far when I saw some one sitting by the roadside. I stopped to see
who it was, and discovered the old man, James, and his little boy. The poor old man was quite
worn out.

"I got him to his feet and had him lean on me, and he walked a little distance, but not very
far. I partly dragged, partly carried, him a short distance farther, but he was quite helpless,
and my strength failed me. Being obliged to leave him to go forward on my own errand, I put
down a quilt I had wrapped around me, rolled him in it, and told the little boy to walk up
and down by his father, and on no account to sit down, or he would be frozen to death. He asked
me very bravely why God or Brigham Young had not sent us some food or blankets.

"I again set out for the camp, running all the way and frequently falling down, for there were
many obstructions and holes in the road. My boots were frozen stiff, so that I had not the
free use of my feet, and it was only by rapid motion that I kept them from being badly frozen.
As it was, both feet have been nipped.

"After some time, I came in sight of the camp-fires, which encouraged me. As I neared the camp,
I frequently overtook stragglers on foot, all pressing forward slowly. I stopped to speak to
each one, cautioning them all against resting, as they would surely freeze to death. Finally,
about eleven P.M., I reached the camp almost exhausted. I had exerted myself very much during
the day, and had not eaten anything since breakfast. I reported to Elder Rae the situation
of the folks behind. He immediately got up some horses, and the boys from the valley started
back about midnight to help the ox-teams in. The night was very severe, and many of the animals
were frozen. It was five A.M. before the last team reached the camp.

"I told my companions about the old man James and his little boy. They found the little fellow
keeping faithful watch over his father, who lay sleeping in my quilt just as I left him. They
lifted him into a wagon, still alive, but in a sort of stupor, and he died just as they got
him up by the fire. His last words were an inquiry as to the safety of his shotgun.

"There were so many dead and dying that it was decided to lay by for the day. In the forenoon
I was appointed to go around the camp and collect the dead. I took with me two young men to
assist me in the sad task, and we collected together, of all ages and both sexes, thirteen
corpses, all stiffly frozen. We had a large square hole dug, in which we buried these thirteen
people, three or four abreast and three deep. When they did not fit in, we put one or two crosswise
at the head or feet of the others. We covered them with willows and then with the earth. When
we buried these thirteen people, some of their relatives refused to attend the services. They
manifested an utter indifference about it. The numbness and cold in their physical natures
seemed to have reached the soul, and to have crushed out natural feeling and affection. Had
I not myself witnessed it, I could not have believed that suffering could produce such terrible
results. But so it was. Two others died during the day, and we buried them in the same big
grave, making fifteen in all. Even so it has been better for them than to stay where their
souls would have been among the rejected at the day of resurrection.

"But for Elder Rae, our leader, we should all have perished by now. He is at times severe and
stern with those who falter, but only for their good. He is all along the line, helping the
women, who well-nigh worship him, and urging on the men. He cheers us by prophesying that we
shall soon prevail over all conditions and all our enemies. I think he must never sleep and
never eat. At all hours of the night he is awake. As to eating, a girl in our hundred, Fidelia,
daughter of Jabez Merrismith, who has been much attracted by him and stays near him when she
can, called him aside the other day, so she has told me, and gave him a biscuit--soaked, perfectly
soaked, with bacon grease. She had saved it for many days. He took it and thanked her, but
later she saw him giving it to the wife of Henry Glines, who is hauling Henry and the two babies
in the cart. She taxed him with not eating it himself; but he told her that she had given him
more than bread, which was the power to give bread. The giving happiness, he told her, is always
a little more than the taking happiness, even when we are starving. He says the one kind of
happiness always keeps a little ahead of the other."

       *       *       *       *       *

December 1st, the remnant of the caravan reached the city of the Saints. Of six hundred setting
out from the Missouri River, over one quarter had died by the way.

And to Joel Rae had now come another mission,--one that would not let him wait, for the spirit
was moving him strangely and strongly,--a mission of reformation.

CHAPTER XIV.

How the Saints Were Brought to Repentance

He put his torch to the tinder of irreligion at the first Sunday meeting after his return.
There were no premonitions, no warnings, no signs.

A few of the Elders had preceded him to rejoice at the escape of the last hand-cart party from
death in the mountains; and Brigham, after giving the newcomers some practical hints about
their shelter during the winter now upon them, had invited Elder Rae to address the congregation.

He arose and came uncertainly forward, apparently weak, able hardly to stand without leaning
upon the desk in front of him; his face waxen and drawn, hollowed at the cheeks and temples,
his long hands thin to transparency. Life was betrayed in him only by the eyes. These burned
darkly, far back under his brows, and flashed fiercely, as his glance darted swiftly from side
to side.

At first he spoke weakly and slowly, his opening words almost inaudible, so that the throng
of people before him leaned forward in sympathetic intentness, and silence became absolute
in the great hall except for the high quavering of his tones. But then came a miracle of reinvigoration.
Little by little his voice swelled until it was full, sonorous, richly warm and compelling,
the words pouring from him with a fluency that enchained. Little by little his leaning, drooping
posture of weakness became one of towering strength, the head flung back, the gestures free
and potent. Little by little his burning eyes seemed to send their flash and glow through all
his body, so that he became a creature of life and fire.

They heard each word now, but still they leaned forward as when he spoke at first, inaudibly--caught
thrilled and breathless in his spell, even to the Elders, Priests, and Apostles sitting near
him. Nor was his manner alone impressive. His words were new. He was calling them sinners and
covenant-breakers, guilty of pride, covetousness, contention, lying, stealing, moral uncleanness--and
launching upon them the curse of Israel's God unless they should repent.

"It has been told you again and again," he thundered, "that if you wish to be great in the
Kingdom of God you must be good. It has been told you many times, and now I burn the words
once more into the bones of your soul, that in this kingdom which the great Elohim has again
set up on earth, no man, no woman, can become great without being good, without being true
to his integrity, faithful to his trust, full of charity and good works.

"Hear it now: if you do not order your lives to do all the good you can, if you are false to
one trust, you shall be stripped naked before Jehovah of all your anticipations of greatness.
And you have failed in your work; you have been false to your trust; you have been lax and
wicked, and you have temporised, nay, affiliated with Gentiles. I have asked myself if this,
after all, may not have been the chief cause of God's present wrath upon us. The flesh is weak.
I have had my own hours of wrestling with Satan. We all know his cunning to take shapes that
most weaken, beguile, and unman us, and small wonder if many of us succumb. But this other
sin is wilful. Not only have Gentile officers, Federal officers, come among us and been let
to insult, abuse, calumniate, and to trample upon our most sacred ordinances, but we have consorted,
traded, and held relations with the Gentiles that pass by us. You have the term 'winter Mormons,'
a generation of vipers who come here, marry your daughters in the fall, rest with you during
the winter, and pass on to the gold fields in the spring, never to return. You, yourselves,
coined the Godless phrase. But how can you utter it without crimson faces? I tell you now,
God is to make a short work upon this earth. His lines are being drawn, and many of you before
me will be left outside. The curtains of Zion have been spread, but you are gone beyond their
folds. You are no longer numbered in the household of faith. For your weak souls the sealing
keys of power have been delivered in vain. You have become waymarks to the kingdom of folly.
This is truth I tell you. It has been frozen and starved into me, but it will be burned into
you. For your sins, the road between here and the Missouri River is a road between two lines
of graves. For your sins, from the little band I have just brought in, one hundred and fifty
faithful ones fell asleep by the wayside, and their bodies went to be gnawed by the wolves.
How long shall others die for you? Forever, think you? No! Your last day is come. Repent, confess
your sins in all haste, be buried again in the waters of baptism, then cast out the Gentile,
and throw off his yoke,--and thereafter walk in trembling all your days,--for your wickedness
has been great."

Such was the opening gun in what became known as the "reformation." The conditions had been
ripe for it, and in that very moment a fever of repentance spread through the two thousand
people who had cowered under his words. Alike with the people below, the leaders about him
had been fired with his spirit, and when he sat down each of them arose in turn and echoed
his words, denouncing the people for their sins and exhorting them to repentance.

After another hour of this excitement, priests and people became alike demoralised, and the
meeting broke up in a confusion of terror.

As the doors of the tabernacle flew open, and the Saints pushed out of that stifling atmosphere
of denunciation, a cry came to the lips of the dozen that first escaped:

"To the river--the waters of baptism!"

The words were being taken up by others until the cry had run back through the crowd to the
leaders, still talking in excited groups about the pulpit. These comprehended when they heard
it, and straightway a line of conscience-stricken Saints was headed toward the river.

There in the icy Jordan, on that chill December afternoon, when the snows lay thick on the
ground, the leaders stood and buried the sinful ones anew in the cleansing waters. From the
sinners themselves came cries of self-accusation; from the crowd on the banks came the strains
of hymns to fortify them for the icy ordeal and the public confession.

There in the freezing current stood Joel Rae until long after the December sun had gone below
the Oquirrh hills, performing his office of baptism, and reviving hope in those his words had
smitten with fear.

His strength already depleted by the long march with the hand-cart party and by the exhausting
strain of the day, he was early chilled by the water into which he plunged the repentant sinners.
For the last hour that he stood in the stream, his whole body was numb; he had ceased to feel
life in his feet, and his arms worked with a mechanical stiffness like the arms of some automaton
over which his mind had control.

For there was no numbness as yet in his mind. It was wonderfully clear and active. He had begun
a great work. His words had been words of fire, and the flames of them had spread so that in
a little while every sinner in Zion should burn in them and be purified. Even the leaders--a
great wave of exultation surged through him at this thought--even Brigham had felt the glow,
and henceforth would be a fiercer Lion of the Lord to resist the Godless Gentile.

Long after sensation had left his body his thoughts were rushing in this fever of realisation,
while his chilled hands made new in the Kingdom such sinners as came there repenting.

Not until night fell did the hymns cease and the crowd dwindle away. The air grew colder, and
he began to feel pain again, the water cutting against his legs like a blade. Little groups
were now hurrying off in the darkness, and the last Saint he had baptised was standing for
the moment, chill and dripping, on the bank.

Seeing there was no one else to come, he staggered out of the stream where he had stood for
three hours, finding his feet curiously clumsy and uncontrollable. Below him in the stream
another Elder still waited to baptise a man and woman; but those who had been above him in
the river were gone, and his own work was done.

He ascended the bank, and stood looking back at the Elder who remained in the stream. This
man was now coming out of the water, having performed his office for the last one who waited.
He called to Joel Rae:

"Don't stand there, Brother Rae. Hurry and get to your fire and your warm drink and your supper,
or you'll be bed-fast with the chills."

"It has been a glorious day, Brother Maltby!"

"Truly, a great work has been begun, thanks to you--but hurry, man! you are freezing. Get to
your fireside. We can't lose you now."

With a parting word he turned and set off down the dark street, walking unsteadily through
the snow, for his feet had to be tossed ahead of him, and he could not always do it accurately.
And the cold, now that he was out of the water, came more keenly upon him, only it seemed to
burn him through and through with a white heat. He felt his arms stiffening in his wet sleeves,
and his knees grow weak. He staggered on past a row of cabins, from which the light of fires
shone out on the snow. At almost every step he stumbled out of the narrow path that had been
trodden.

"To your own fireside." He recalled the words of Elder Maltby, and remembered his own lone,
dark cabin, himself perhaps without strength to build a fire or to get food, perhaps without
even strength to reach the place, for he felt weaker now, all at once, and put his hand out
to support himself against the fence.

He had been hearing footsteps behind him, creaking rapidly over the packed snow-path. He might
have to ask for help to reach his home. Even as the steps came close, he felt himself swaying.
He leaned over on the fence, but to his amazement that swayed, too, and threw him back. Then
he felt himself falling toward the street; but the creaking steps ceased, now by his side,
and he felt under him something soft but firm--something that did not sway as the fence had
unaccountably done. With his balance thus regained, he discovered the thing that held him to
be a woman's arm. A woman's face looked close into his, and then she spoke.

"You are so cold. I knew you would be. And I waited--I wanted to do for you--let me!"

At once there came back to him the vision of a white-faced woman in the crowd along the river
bank, staring at him out of deep, gray eyes under heavy, black brows.

"Mara--Mara!"

"Yes, yes--you are so cold!"

"But you must not stand so close--see, I am wet--you will be chilled!"

"But you are already chilled; your clothes are freezing on you; and you were falling just now.
Can you walk?"

"Yes--yes--my house is yonder."

"I know; it's far; it's beyond the square. You must come with me."

"But your house is still farther!"

She had started him now, with a firm grasp of his arm, walking beside him in the deep snow,
and trying to keep him in the narrow path.

"No--I am staying here with Hubert Plimon's two babies, while the mother has gone to Provo
where Hubert lies sick. See--the light there. Come with me--here's the gate--you shall be warmed."

Slowly and with many stumblings, leaning upon her strong arm, he made his way to the cabin
door. She pushed it open before him and he felt the great warm breath of the room rush out
upon him. Then he was inside, swaying again uncertainly upon his feet. In the hovering light
that came from the fireplace he saw the bed in the far corner where the two small children
were sleeping, saw Mara with her back to the door, facing him breathlessly, saw the heavy shadows
all about; but he was conscious of hardly more than the vast heavenly warmth that rolled out
from the fire and enfolded him and made him drunk.

Again he would have fallen, but she steadied him down on to a wide couch covered with buffalo
robes, beside the big fireplace; and here he fell at once into a stupor. She drew out the couch
so that it caught more of the heat, pulled off the water-soaked boots and the stiffened coat,
wrapped him in a blanket which she warmed before the fire, and covered him still again with
one of the buffalo robes.

She went then to bring food and to make a hot drink, which she strengthened with brandy poured
from a little silver flask.

Presently she aroused him to drink the hot liquor, and then, after another blank of stupor,
she aroused him again, to eat. He could take but little of the food, but called for more of
the drink, and felt the soul of it thrill along his frozen nerves until they awoke, sharpened,
alert, and eager. He lay so, with closed eyes a little time, floating in an ecstasy that seemed
to be half stupor and half of keenest sensibility. Then he opened his eyes. She was kneeling
by the couch on which he lay. He felt her soft, quick breathing, and noted the unnatural shining
of her eyes and lips where the firelight fell upon them. All at once he threw out his arms
and drew her to him with such a shuddering rush of power that she cried aloud in quick alarm--but
the cry was smothered under his kisses.

For ages the transport seemed to endure, the little world of his senses whirling madly through
an illimitable space of sensuous light, his lips melting upon hers, his neck bending in the
circle of pulsing warmth that her soft arms wove about it, his own arms crushing to his breast
with frenzied fervour the whole yielding splendour of her womanhood. A moment so, then he fell
back upon the couch, all his body quivering under the ecstasy from her parted lips, his triumphant
senses rioting insolently through the gray, cold garden of his vows.

She drew a little back, her hands resting on his shoulders, and he saw again the firelight
shining in her eyes and upon her lips. Yet the eyes were now lighted with a strange, sad reluctance,
even while the mutinous lips opened their inciting welcome.

He was floating--floating midway between a cold, bleak heaven of denial and a luring hell of
consent; floating recklessly, as if careless to which his soul should go.

His gaze was once more upon her face, and now, in a curiously cool little second of observation,
he saw mirrored there the same conflicting duality that he knew raged within himself. In her
eyes glowed the pure flame of fear and protest--but on her mad lips was the curl of provocation.
And as the man in him had waited carelessly, in a sensuous luxury of unconcern, for his soul
to go where it might--far up or far down--so now the woman waited before him in an incurious,
unbiassed calm--the clear eyes with their grave, stern "No!"--the parted lips all but shuddering
out their "Yes!"

Still he looked and still the leaning woman waited--waited to welcome with impartial fervour
the angel or the devil that might come forth.

And then, as he lay so, there started with electric quickness, from some sudden coldness of
recollection, the image of Prue. Sharp and vivid it shone from this chill of truth like a glittering
star from the clean winter sky outside. Prue was before him with the tender blue of her eyes
and the fleecy gold of her hair and her joy of a child--her little figure shrugging and nestling
in his arms in happy faith--calling as she had called to him that morning--"Joel--Joel--Joel!"

He shivered in this flood of cold, relentless light, yet unflinchingly did he keep his face
turned full upon the truth it revealed.

And this was now more than the image of the sweetheart he had sworn to cherish--it was also
the image of himself vowed to his great mission. He knew that upon neither of these could he
suffer a blemish to come if he would not be forever in agony. With appalling clearness the
thing was lined out before him.

The woman at his side stirred and his eyes were again upon her. At once she saw the truth in
them. Her parted lips came together in a straight line, shutting the red fulness determinedly
in. Then there shone from her eyes a glad, sweet welcome to the angel that had issued.

His arms seemed to sicken, falling limply from her. She arose without speaking, and busied
herself a little apart, her back to him.

He sat up on the couch, looking about the little room curiously, as one recovering consciousness
in strange surroundings. Then he began slowly to pull on the wet boots that she had placed
near the fire.

When he stood up, put on his coat, and reached for his hat, she came up to him, hesitating, timid.

"You are so cold! If you would only stay here--I am afraid you will be sick."

He answered very gently:

"It is better to go. I am strong again, now."

"I would--I would not be near you--and I am afraid for you to go out again in the cold."

He smiled a little. "Nothing can hurt me now--I am strong."

He opened the door, breathing his fill of the icy air that rushed in. He stepped outside, then
turned to her. She stood in the doorway, the light from the room melting the darkness about them.

They looked long at each other. Then in a sudden impulse of gratitude, of generous feeling
toward her, he put out his arm and drew her to him. She was cold, impassive. He bent over and
lightly kissed her closed, unresponding lips. As he drew away, her hand caught his wrist for
a second.

"I'm glad!" she said.

He tried to answer, but could only say, "Good night, Mara!"

Then he turned, drew the wide collar of his coat well up, and went down the narrow path through
the snow. She stood, framed in the light of the doorway, leaning out to look after him until
he was lost in the darkness.

As she stepped back and closed the door, a man, who had halted by a tree in front of the next
house when the door first opened, walked on again.

It had been a great day, but, for one cause or another, it came near to being one of the last
days of the man who had made it great.

Late the next afternoon, Joel Rae was found in his cabin by a messenger from Brigham. He had
presumably lain there unattended since the night before, and now he was delirious and sick
unto death; raving of the sins of the Saints, and of his great work of reformation. So tenderly
sympathetic was his mind, said those who came to care for him, that in his delirium he ranked
himself among the lowest of sinners in Zion, imploring them to take him out and bury him in
the waters of baptism so that he might again be worthy to preach them the Word of God.

He was at once given every care, and for six weeks was not left alone night or day; the good
mothers in Israel vying with each other in kindly offices for the sick Elder, and the men praying
daily that he might not be taken so soon after his great work had begun.

The fifth wife of Elder Pixley came once to sit by his bedside, but when she heard him rave
of some great sin that lay black upon his soul, beseeching forgiveness for it while the tears
rained down his fevered face, she had professed that his suffering sickened her so she could
not stay. Thereafter she had contented herself with inquiring at his door each day--until the
day when they told her that the sickness was broken; that he was again rational and doubtless
would soon be well. After that she went no more; which was not unnatural, for Elder Pixley
was about to return from his three years' mission abroad, and there was much to do in the community-house
in preparation for the master's coming.

But the long sickness of the young Elder did not in any manner stay the great movement he had
inaugurated. From that first Sunday the reformation spread until it had reached every corner
of the new Zion. The leaders took up the accusing cry,--the Elders, Bishops, High Priests,
and Counsellors. Missionaries were appointed for the outlying settlements, and meetings were
held daily in every center, with a general renewing of covenants.

Brigham, who had warmly seconded Joel Rae's opening discourse, was now, not unnaturally, the
leader of the reformation, and in his preaching to the Saints while Joel Rae lay sick he committed
no faults of vagueness. For profane swearing he rebuked his people: "You Elders in Israel will
go to the cañons for wood, get a little brush-whipped, and then curse and swear--damn and curse
your oxen and swear by Him who created you. You rip and curse as bad as any pirates ever did!"

For the sin of cattle-stealing he denounced them. A fence high enough to keep out cattle-thieves,
he told them, must be high enough to keep out the Devil.

Sometimes his grievance would have a personal basis, as when he told them: "I have gone to
work and made roads to the cañon for wood; and I have cut wood down and piled it up, and then
I have not got it. I wonder if any of you can say as much about the wood I have left there.
I could tell stories of Elders that found and took my wood that should make professional thieves
blush. And again I have proof to show that Bishops have taken thousands of pounds of wheat
in tithing which they have never reported to the general tithing-office,--proof that they stole
the wheat to let their friends speculate upon."

Under this very pointed denunciation many of the flock complained bitterly. But Brigham only
increased the flow of his wrath upon them. "You need," said he, "to have it rain pitchforks,
tines downward, from this pulpit, Sunday after Sunday."

Still there were rebellious Saints to object, and, as Brigham drew the lines of his wrath tighter,
these became more prominent in the community. When they voiced their discontent, they angered
the priesthood. But when they indicated their purpose to leave the valley, as many soon did,
they gave alarm. An exodus must be prevented at any cost, and so the priesthood let it be known
that migrations from the valley would be considered as nothing less than apostasy.

But, as the reform wave swept on, it became apparent that these words had been considered merely
figurative by many who were about to seek homes outside the valley. From every side news came
privately that this family or that was preparing to leave.

And so it came about that the first Sunday Joel Rae was able to walk to the tabernacle, still
weak and wasted and trembling, he heard a sermon from Brigham which made him question his own
soul in an agony of terror. For, on this day, was boldly preached, for the first time in Zion,
something which had never before been more than whispered among the highest elect,--the doctrine
of blood-atonement--of human sacrifice.

"I am preaching St. Paul, this morning," began Brigham, easily.

There was a rustling movement in the throng before him, and he paused until it subsided.

"I tell you there are men and women amongst you who ought to come and ask me to select a place
and appoint a committee to shed their blood. Only in that way can they be saved, for water
will not do. Their sins are too deep for that. I repeat--there are covenant-breakers here,
and we need a place set apart and men designated to shed their blood for their own salvation.
If any of you ask, do I mean you, I answer yes. We have tried long enough with you, and now
I shall let the sword of the Almighty be unsheathed, not only in words but in deed. I tell
you there are sins for which men cannot otherwise receive forgiveness in this world nor in
the world to come; and if you guilty ones had your eyes opened to your true condition, you
would be willing to have your blood spilt upon the ground that the smoke thereof might go up
to heaven for your sins. I know when you hear this talk about cutting people off from the earth
you will consider it strong doctrine; but it is to save them, and not destroy them. Take a
person in this congregation who knows the principles of that kind of life and sees the beauties
of eternity before him compared with the vain and foolish things of the world--and suppose
he is overtaken in a gross fault which he knows will rob him of that exaltation which he desires
and which he now cannot obtain without the shedding of his blood; and suppose he knows that
by having his blood shed he will atone for that sin and be saved and exalted with the Gods.
Is there a man or woman here but would say, 'Save me--shed my blood, that I may be exalted.'
And how many of you love your neighbour well enough to save him in that way? That is what Christ
meant by loving our neighbours as ourselves. I could refer you to plenty of instances where
men have been righteously slain to atone for their sin; I have seen scores and hundreds of
people for whom there would have been a chance in the last day if their lives had been taken
and their blood spilt upon the ground as a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now
angels to the Devil because it was not done. The weakness and ignorance of the nations forbids
this law being in full and open force; yet, remember, if our neighbour needs help we must help
him. If his soul is in danger we must save it.

"Now as to our enemies--apostates and Gentiles--the tree that brings not forth good fruit shall
be hewn down. 'What,' you ask, 'do you believe that people would do right to put these traitors
to death?' Yes! What does the United States government do with traitors? Examine the doings
of earthly governments on this point and you will find but one practise universal. A word to
the wise is enough; just remember that there are sins that the blood of a lamb, of a calf,
or of a turtle-dove, cannot remit."

Under this discourse Joel Rae sat terrified, with a bloodless face, cowering as he had made
others to cower six weeks before. The words seemed to carry his own preaching to its rightful
conclusion; but now how changed was his world!--a whirling, sickening chaos of sin and remorse.

As he listened to Brigham's words, picturing the blood of the sinner smoking on the ground,
his thoughts fled back to that night, that night of wondrous light and warmth, the last he
could remember before the great blank came.

Now the voice of Brigham came to him again: "And almost all things are by the law purged with
blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission!"

Then the service ended, and he saw Bishop Wright pushing toward him through the crowd.

"Well, well, Brother Rae you do look peaked, for sure! But you'll pick up fast enough, and
just in time, too. Lord! what won't Brother Brigham do when the Holy Ghost gets a strangle-holt
on him? Now, then," he added, in a lower tone, "if I ain't mistaken, there's going to be some
work for the Sons of Dan!"

CHAPTER XV.

How the Souls of Apostates Were Saved

The Wild Ram of the Mountains had spoken truly; there was work at hand for the Sons of Dan.
When his Witness at last came to Joel Rae, he tried vainly to recall the working of his mind
at this time; to remember where he had made the great turn--where he had faced about. For,
once, he knew, he had been headed the way he wished to go, a long, plain road, reaching straight
toward the point whither all the aspirations of his soul urged him.

And then, all in a day or in a night, though he had seen never a turn in the road, though he
had gone a true and straight course, suddenly he had looked up to find he was headed the opposite
way. After facing his goal so long, he was now going from it--and never a turn! It was the
wretched paradox of a dream.

The day after Brigham's sermon on blood-atonement, there had been a meeting in the Historian's
office, presided over by Brigham. And here for the first time Joel Rae found he was no longer
looked upon as one too radical. Somewhat dazedly, too, he realised at this close range the
severely practical aspects of much that he had taught in theory. It was strange, almost unnerving,
to behold his own teachings naked of their pulpit rhetoric; to find his long-cherished ideals
materialised by literal-minded, practiced men. And then he had heard the business of the meeting
discussed. Decisions were reached swiftly, and orders given in words that were few and plain.
Even had these orders been repugnant to him, they were not to be questioned; they came from
an infallible priesthood, obedience to which was the first essential to his soul's salvation;
and they came again from the head of an organisation to which he was bound by every oath he
had been taught to hold sacred. But, while they left him dazed, disconcerted, and puzzled,
he was by no means certain that they were repugnant. They were but the legitimate extension
of his teachings since childhood, and of his own preaching.

In custody at Kayesville, twenty-five miles north of Salt Lake City, were six men who had been
arrested by church authority while on their way east from California. They were suspected of
being federal spies. The night following the meeting which Joel Rae had attended, these prisoners
were attacked while they slept. Two were killed at once; two more after a brief struggle; and
the remaining two the following day, after they had been pursued through the night. The capable
Bishop Wright declared in confidence to Joel Rae that it reminded him of old days at Nauvoo.

The same week was saved Rosmas Anderson, who had incurred rejection from Israel and eternal
wrath by his misbehaviour. Becoming submissive to the decree of the Church, when it was made
known to him by certain men who came in the night, it was believed that his atonement would
suffice to place him once more in the household of faith. He had asked but half a day to prepare
for the solemn ceremony. His wife, regretful but firm in the faith, had provided clean garments
for her sinful husband, and the appointed executioners dug his grave. They went for him at
midnight. By the side of the grave they had let him kneel and pray. His throat had then been
cut by a deft hand, and he was held so that his blood ran into the grave, thus consummating
the sacrifice to the God of Israel. The widow, obeying priestly instructions, announced that
her husband had gone to California.

Then the soul of William Parrish at Springville was saved to eternal glory; also the soul of
his son, Beason. For both of these sinful ones were on the verge of apostasy; had plotted,
indeed, and made secret preparations to leave the valley, all of which were discovered by church
emissaries, fortunately for the eternal welfare of the two most concerned. Yet a few years
later, when the hated Gentiles had gained some shadow of authority in the new Zion, their minions
were especially bitter as to this feat of mercy, seeking, indeed, to indict the performers of it.

As to various persons who met death while leaving the valley, opinion was divided on the question
of their ultimate salvation. For it was announced concerning these, as their bodies were discovered
from time to time, that the Indians had killed them. This being true, they had died in apostasy,
and their rejection from the Kingdom was assured. Yet after awhile the Saints at large took
hope touching the souls of these; for Bishop Wright, the excellent and able Wild Ram of the
Mountains, took occasion to remark one Sabbath in the course of an address delivered in the
tabernacle: "And it amazes me, brethren, to note how the spirit has been poured out on the
Lamanites. It really does seem as if an Injun jest naturally hates an apostate, and it beats
me how they can tell 'em the minute they try to sneak out of this valley of the Lord. They
must lie out in them hills jest a-waiting for apostates; and they won't have anything else;
they never touch the faithful. You wouldn't think they had so much fine feeling to look at
'em. You wouldn't suspect they was so sensitive, and almost bigoted, you might say. But there
it is--and I don't believe the critters will let many of these vile apostates get beyond the
rocky walls of Zion." Those who could listen between the words began to suspect that the souls
of such apostates had been duly saved.

Yet one apostate the very next day was rash enough to controvert the Bishop's views. To a group
of men in the public street at high noon and in a loud voice he declared his intention of leaving
for California, and he spoke evil of the Church.

"I tell you," he said, in tones of some excitement, "men are murdered here. Their murder is
planned by Bishops, Priests, Elders, and Apostles, by the President and his Counsellors, and
then it is done by men they send to do it. Their laying it on to the Indians don't fool me
a minute. That's the kind of a church this is, and you don't ketch me staying in it any longer!"

Trees had been early planted in the new settlement, and owing to the care bestowed upon them
by the thrifty colonists, many were now matured. From a stout limb of one of these the speaker
was found hanging the following morning. A coroner's jury hastily summoned from among the Saints
found that he had committed suicide.

Another whose soul was irrevocably lost was Frederick Loba, who had refused to take more than
one wife in spite of the most explicit advice from his superiors that he could attain to but
little glory either in this world or that to come with less than three. He crowned his offense
by speaking disrespectfully of Brigham Young. Orders were issued to save his soul; but before
his tabernacle could be seized by those who would have saved him, the wretched man had taken
his one wife and fled to the mountains. There they wandered many days in the most inclement
weather, lost, famished, and several times but narrowly escaping the little band that had been
sent in pursuit of them; whose members would, had they been permitted, not only have terminated
their bodily suffering, but saved their souls to a worthy place in the life to come. As it
was, they wandered a distance of three hundred miles, and three days after their last food
was eaten, the man carrying the woman in his arms the last six miles, they reached a camp of
the Snake Indians. These, not sharing with their Utah brethren the prejudice against apostates,
gave them a friendly welcome, and guided them to Fort Laramie, thereby destroying for the unhappy
man and his wife their last chance of coming forth in the final resurrection. But few at this
time were so unlucky as this pair; for judgment had begun at the house of the Lord, and Israel
was attentively at work.

It was now that Joel Rae became conscious that he was facing directly away from the glory he
had so long sought and suffered for. Though as yet no blood for Israel had been shed in his
actual presence, he had attended the meetings of the Sons of Dan, and was kept aware of their
operations. It seemed to him in after years that his faculties had at this time been in trance.

He was seized at length with an impulse to be away from it all. As the days went by with their
tragedies, he became half wild with restlessness and a strange fear of himself. In spite of
his lifelong training, he knew there was wrong in the air. He could not question the decrees
of the priesthood, but this much became clear to him,--that only one thing could carry with
it more possibilities of evil than this course of the Church toward dissenters--and that was
to doubt that Brigham Young's voice was as the voice of God. Not yet could he bring himself
to this. But the unreasoning desire to be away became so strong that he knew he must yield to it.

Turning this in his mind one day he met a brother Elder, a man full of zeal who had lately
returned from a mission abroad. There had been, he said, a great outpouring of the spirit in Wales.

"And what a glorious day has dawned here," he continued. "Thank God, there is a way to save
the souls of the blind! That reminds me--have you heard of the saving work Brother Pixley was
obliged to do?"

"Brother Pixley?--no." He heard his own voice tremble, in spite of his effort at self-control.
The other became more confidential, stepping closer and speaking low.

"Of course, it ain't to be talked of freely, but you have a right to know, for was it not your
own preaching that led to this glorious reformation? You see, Brother Pixley came back with
me, after doing great works abroad. Naturally, he came full of love for his wives. But he had
been here only a few days when he became convinced that one of them had forgotten him; something
in her manner made him suspect it, for she was a woman of singularly open, almost recklessly
open, nature. Then a good neighbour came and told him that one night, while on his way for
the doctor, he had seen this woman take leave of her lover--had seen the man, whom he could
not recognise, embrace her at parting. He taxed her with this, and she at once confessed, though
protesting that she had not sinned, save in spirit. You can imagine his grief, Brother Rae,
for he had loved the woman. Well, after taking counsel from Brigham, he talked the matter over
with her very calmly, telling her that unless her blood smoked upon the ground, she would be
cast aside in eternity. She really had spiritual aspirations, it seems, for she consented to
meet the ordeal. Then, of course, it was necessary to learn from her the name of the man--and
when all was ready for the sacrifice, Brother Pixley commanded her to make it known."

"Tell me which of Brother Pixley's wives it was." He could feel the little cool beads of sweat
upon his forehead.

"The fifth, did I not say? But to his amazement and chagrin, she refused to give him the name
of the man, and he had no way of learning it otherwise, since there was no one he could suspect.
He pointed out to her that not even her blood could save her should she die shielding him.
But she declared that he was a good man, and that rather than bring disgrace upon him she would
die--would even lose her soul; that in truth she did not care to live, since she loved him
so that living away from him was worse than death. I have said she was a woman of a large nature,
somewhat reckless and generous, and her mistaken notion of loyalty led her to persist in spite
of all the threats and entreaties of her distressed husband. She even smiled when she told
him that she would rather die than live away from this unknown man, smiled in a way that must
have enraged him--since he had never won that kind of love from her for himself--for then he
let her meet the sacrifice without further talk. He drew her on to his knee, kissed her for
the last time, then held her head back--and the thing was done. How sad it is that she did
not make a full confession. Then, by her willing sacrifice, she would have gone direct to the
circle of the Gods and Goddesses; but now, dying as she did, her soul must be lost--"

"Which wife did you say--"

"The fifth--she that was Mara Cavan--but, dear me, Brother Rae! you should not be out so soon!
Why, man, you're weak as a cat! Come, I'll walk with you as far as your house, and you must
lie abed again until you are stronger. I can understand how you wished to be up as soon as
possible; how proud you must feel that your preaching has led to this glorious awakening and
made it possible to save the souls of many sinful ones--but you must be careful not to overtax
yourself."

Four days later, a white-faced young Elder applied to Brigham for permission to go to the settlements
on the south. He professed to be sick, to have suffered a relapse owing to incautious exposure
so soon after his long illness. He seemed, indeed, not only to be weak, but to be much distressed
and torn in his mind.

Brigham was gracious enough to accord the desired permission, adding that the young Elder could
preach the revived gospel and rebaptise on his way south, thus combining work with recreation.
He was also good enough to volunteer some advice.

"What ails you mostly, Brother Joel, is your single state. What you need is wives. You've been
here ten years now, and it's high time. You're given to brooding over things that are other
people's to brood on, and then, you're naturally soul-proud. Now, a few wives will humble you
and make you more reasonable, like the rest of us. I don't want to be too downright with you,
like I am with some of the others, because I've always had a special kind of feeling for you,
and so I've let you go on. But you think it over, and talk to me about it when you come back.
It's high time you was building up your thrones and dominions in the Kingdom."

He started south the next day, riding down between the two mountain ranges that bordered the
valley, stopping at each settlement, breathing more freely, resting more easily, as each day
took him farther away. Yet, when he closed his eyes, there, like an echo, was the vision of
a woman's face with shining eyes and lips,--a vision that after a few seconds was washed away
by a great wave of blood.

But after a few days, certain bits of news caught up with him that happily drove this thing
from his sight for a time by stirring within him all his old dread of Gentile persecution.

First he heard that Parley Pratt, the Archer of Paradise and one of the Twelve Apostles, had
been foully murdered back in Arkansas while seeking to carry to their mother the children of
his ninth wife. The father of these children, so his informant reported, had waylaid and shot him.

Then came rumours of a large wagon-train going south through Utah on its way to California.
Reports said it was composed chiefly of Missourians, some of whom were said to be boasting
that they had helped to expel the Saints from Jackson County in that State. Also in this train
were reported to be several men from Arkansas who had been implicated in the assassination
of Apostle Pratt.

But news of the crowning infamy reached him the following day,--news that had put out all thought
of his great sin and his bloody secret, news of a thing so monstrous that he was unable to
give it credence until it had been confirmed by other comers from the north. President Buchanan,
inspired by tales that had reached him of various deeds growing out of the reformation, and
by the treatment which various Federal officers were said to have received, had decided that
rebellion existed in the Territory of Utah. He had appointed a successor to Brigham Young as
governor, so the report ran, and ordered an army to march to Salt Lake City for the alleged
purpose of installing the new executive.

Three days later all doubt of the truth of this story was banished. Word then came that Brigham
was about to declare martial law, and that he had promised that Buchanan's army should never
enter the valley.

Now his heart beat high again, with something of the old swift fervour. The Gentile yoke was
at last to be thrown off. War would come, and the Lord would surely hold them safe while they
melted away the Gentile hosts.

He reached the settlement of Parowan that night, and when they told him there that the wagon-train
coming south--their ancient enemies who had plundered and butchered them in Jackson County--was
to be cut off before it left the basin, it seemed but right to him, the just vengeance of Heaven
upon their one-time despoilers, and a fitting first act in the war-drama that was now to be played.

Once more the mob was marching upon them to despoil and murder and put them into the wilderness.
But now God had nerved and strengthened them to defend the walls of Zion, even against a mighty
nation. And as a token of His favour and His wish, here was a company of their bitterest foes
delivered into their hands. Beside the picture was another; he saw his sister, the slight,
fair girl, in the grasp of the fiends at Haun's Mill; the face of his father tossing on the
muddy current and sucked under to the river-bottom; and the rough bark cylinder, festooned
with black cloth, holding the worn form of the mother whose breast had nursed him.

When he started he had felt that he could never again preach while that secret lay upon him,--that
he could no longer rebuke sinners honestly,--but this matter of war was different. And when
he was done the congregation had made the little dimly lighted meeting-house at Parowan ring
with a favourite hymn:--

  "Up, awake, ye defenders of Zion!
   The foe's at the door of your homes;
   Let each heart be the heart of a lion,
   Unyielding and proud as he roams.
   Remember the wrongs of Missouri,
   Remember the fate of Nauvoo!
   When the God-hating foe is before ye,
   Stand firm and be faithful and true."

CHAPTER XVI.

The Order from Headquarters

He left Parowan the next morning to preach at one of the little settlements to the east. He
was gone three days. When he came back they told him that the train of Missourians had passed
through Parowan and on to the south. He attended a military council held that evening in the
meeting-house. Three days of reflection, while it had not cooled the anger he felt toward these
members of the mob that had so brutally wronged his people, had slightly cooled his ardour
for aggressive warfare.

It was rather a relief to know that he was not in a position of military authority; to feel
that this matter of cutting off a wagon-train was in the hands of men who could do no wrong.
The men who composed the council he knew to be under the immediate guidance of the Lord. Their
names and offices made this certain. There was George A. Smith, First Counsellor to Brigham,
representing as such the second person of the Trinity, and also one of the Twelve Apostles.
There was Isaac Haight, President of the Cedar City Stake of Zion and High Priest of Southern
Utah; there were Colonel Dame, President of the Parowan Stake of Zion, Philip Klingensmith,
Bishop from Cedar City, and John Doyle Lee, Brigham's most trusted lieutenant in the south,
a major of militia, probate judge, member of the Legislature, President of Civil Affairs at
Harmony, and farmer to the Indians under Brigham.

When a call to arms came as a result of this council, and an official decree was made known
that the obnoxious emigrant train was to be cut off, he could not but feel that the deed had
heavenly sanction. As to worldly regularity, the proceeding seemed to be equally faultless.
The call was a regular military call by the superior officers to the subordinate officers and
privates of the regiment, commanding them to muster, armed and equipped as directed by law,
and prepared for field operations. Back of the local militia officers was his Excellency, Brigham
Young, not only the vicar of God on earth but governor of Utah and commander-in-chief of the
militia. It seemed, indeed, a foretaste of those glorious campaigns long promised them, when
they should go through the land of the Gentiles "like a lion among the flocks of sheep, cutting
down, breaking in pieces, with none to deliver, leaving the land desolate."

The following Tuesday he continued south to Cedar City, the most populous of the southern settlements.
Here he learned of the campaign's progress. Brigham's courier had preceded the train on its
way south, bearing written orders to the faithful to hold no dealings with its people; to sell
them neither forage for their stock nor food for themselves. They had, it was reported, been
much distressed as a result of this order, and their stock was greatly weakened. At Cedar City,
it being feared that they might for want of supplies be forced to halt permanently so near
the settlement that it would be inconvenient to destroy them, they were permitted to buy fifty
bushels of wheat and to have it and some corn the Indians had sold them ground at the mill
of Major Lee.

As Joel's informant, the fiery Bishop Klingensmith, remarked, this was not so generous as it
seemed, since, while it would serve to decoy them on their way toward San Bernardino, they
would never get out of the valley with it.

Here at daybreak the morning before, Klingensmith told him, a band of Piede Indians, under
Lee's direction, had attacked the train, killing and wounding a number of the men. It had been
hoped, explained Klingensmith, that the train would be destroyed at once by the Indians, thus
avoiding any call upon the militia; but the emigrants had behaved with such effectiveness that
the Indians were unable to complete the task. They had corralled their wagons, dug a rifle-pit
in the center, and returned the fire, killing one Indian and wounding two of the chiefs. The
siege was being continued.

The misgiving that this tale caused Joel Rae he put down to unmanly weakness--and to an unfamiliarity
with military affairs. A sight of the order in Brigham's writing for the train's extermination
would have set his mind wholly at rest; but though he had not been granted this, he was assured
that such an order existed, and with this he was obliged to be content. He knew, indeed, that
an order from Brigham, either oral or written, must have come; otherwise the local authorities
would never have dared to proceed. They were not the men to act without orders in a matter
so grave after the years in which Brigham had preached his right to dictate, direct, and control
the affairs of his people from the building of the temple "down to the ribbons a woman should
wear, or the setting up of a stocking."

Late on the following day, Wednesday, while they were anxiously waiting for news, a messenger
from Lee came with a call for reinforcements. The Indians, although there were three hundred
of them, had been unable to prevail over the little entrenched band of Gentiles. Ten minutes
after the messenger's arrival, the militia, which had been waiting under arms, set out for
the scene in wagons. From Cedar City went every able-bodied man but two.

Joel Rae was with them, wondering why he went. He wanted not to go. He preferred that news
of the approaching victory should be brought to him; yet invisible hands had forced him, even
while it seemed that frenzied voices--voices without sound--warned him back.

The ride was long, but not long enough for his mind to clear. It was still clouded with doubts
and questionings and fears when they at last saw the flaring of many fires with figures loitering
or moving busily about them. As they came nearer, a strange, rhythmic throbbing crept to his
ears; nearer still, he resolved it into the slow, regular beatings of a flat-toned drum. The
measure, deliberate, incessant, changeless,--the same tones, the same intervals,--worked upon
his strained nerves, at first soothingly and then as a pleasant stimulant.

The wagons now pulled up near the largest camp fire, and the arrivals were greeted by a dozen
or so of the Saints, who, with Major Lee, had been directing and helping the Indians in their
assaults upon the enemy. Several of these had disguised themselves as Indians for the better
deception of the besieged.

At the right of their camp went the long line of the Indians' fires. From far down this line
came a low ringing chant and the strangely insistent drum-beats.

"They're mourning old Chief Moqueetus," explained Lee. "He fell asleep before the fire just
about dark, while his corn and potatoes were cooking, and he had a bad nightmare. The old fellow
woke up screaming that he had his double-hands full of blood, and he grabbed his gun and was
up on top of the hill firing down before he was really awake, I guess. Anyway, one of the cusses
got him--like as not the same one that did this to-day while I was peeking at them," and he
showed them a bullet-hole in his hat.

At fires near by the Indians were broiling beef cut from animals they had slaughtered belonging
to the wagon-train. Still others were cutting the hides into strips to be made into lariats.
As far down as the line could be seen, there were dusky figures darting in and out of the firelight.

A council was at once called of the Presidents, Bishops, Elders, High Priests, and the officers
of the militia who were present. Bishop Klingensmith bared his massive head in the firelight
and opened the council with prayer, invoking the aid of God to guide them aright. Then Major
Higbee, presiding as chairman, announced the orders under which they were assembled and under
which the train had been attacked.

"It is ordered from headquarters that this party must be used up, except such as are too young
to tell tales. We got to do it. They been acting terrible mean ever since we wouldn't sell
them anything. If we let them go on now, they been making their brag that they'll raise a force
in California and come back and wipe us out--and Johnston's army already marching on us from
the east. Are we going to submit again to what we got in Missouri and in Illinois? No! Everybody
is agreed about that. Now the Indians have failed to do it like we thought they would, so we
got to finish it up, that's all."

Joel Rae spoke for the first time.

"You say except such as are too young to tell tales, Brother Higbee; what does that mean?"

"Why, all but the very smallest children, of course."

"Are there children here?"

Lee answered:

"Oh, a fair sprinkling--about what you'd look for in a train of a hundred and thirty people.
The boys got two of the kids yesterday; the fools had dressed them up in white dresses and
sent them out with a bucket for water. You can see their bodies lying over there this side
of the spring."

"And there are women?" he asked, feeling a great sickness come upon him.

"Plenty of them," answered Klingensmith, "some mighty fine women, too; I could see one yesterday,
a monstrous fine figure and hair shiny like a crow's wing, and a little one, powerful pretty,
and one kind of between the two--it's a shame we can't keep some of them, but orders is orders!"

"These women must be killed, too?"

"That's the orders from headquarters, Brother Rae."

"From the military headquarters at Parowan, or from the spiritual headquarters at Salt Lake?"

"Better not inquire how far back that order started, Brother Rae--not of me, anyway."

"But women and children--"

"The great Elohim has spoken from the heavens, Brother Rae--that's enough for me. I can't put
my human standards against the revealed will of God."

"But women and children--" He repeated the words as if he sought to comprehend them. He seemed
like a man with defective sight who has come suddenly against a wall that he had thought far
off. Higbee now addressed him.

"Brother Rae, in religion you have to eat the bran along with the flour. Did you suppose we
were going to milk the Gentiles and not ever shed any blood?"

"But innocent blood--"

"There ain't a drop of innocent blood in the whole damned train. And what are you, to be questioning
this way about orders from on high? I've heard you preach many a time about the sin of such
doings as that. You preach in the pulpit about stubborn clay in the hands of the potter having
to be put through the mill again, and now that you're out here in the field, seems to me you
get limber like a tallowed rag when an order comes along."

"Defenseless women and little children--" He was still trying to regain his lost equilibrium.
Lee now interposed.

"Yes, Brother Rae, as defenseless as that pretty sister of yours was in the woods there, that
afternoon at Haun's Mill."

The reminder silenced him for the moment. When he could listen again, he heard them canvassing
a plan of attack that should succeed without endangering any of their own numbers. He walked
away from the group to see if alone, out of the tumult and torrent of lies and half-truths,
he could not fetch some one great unmistakable truth which he felt instinctively was there.

And then his ears responded again to the slow chant and the constant measured beat of the flat-toned,
vibrant drum. Something in its rhythm searched and penetrated and swayed and seemed to overwhelm
him. It came as the measured, insistent beat of fate itself, relentless, inexorable; and all
the time it was stirring in him vague, latent instincts of savagery. He wished it would stop,
so that he might reason, yet dreaded that it might stop at any moment. Fascinated by the weird
rhythm and the hollow beat, he could not summon the will to go beyond its sway.

He walked about the fires or lingered by the groups in consultation until the first signs of
dawn. Then he climbed the low, rocky hill to the east and peered over the top, the drum-beats
still pulsing through him, still coercing him. As the light grew, he could make out the details
of the scene below. Ballpark-pack are later free lack, of it could be now might flash away his

 Many stout wagons and valuable
pieces of equipment had thus been cheaply secured by the Saints round about Cedar City.

He knew that the surviving children, seventeen in number, had been "sold out" to Saints in
and about Cedar City, Harmony, and Painter's Creek, who would later present bills for their keep.

He knew that Lee, whom the Bishops had promised a crown of glory for his work that day, had
gone to Salt Lake City and made a confidential report to Brigham; that Brigham had at first
professed to regard the occurrence as unfortunate for the Church, though admitting that no
innocent blood had been shed; that he had sworn Lee never to tell the story again to any person,
instructing him to make a written report of the affair to himself, as Indian agent, charging
the deed to the Indians. He was said to have added on this point, after a period of reflection,
"Only Indians, John, don't save even the little children." He was reported to have told Lee
further, on the following day, that he had asked God to take the vision from his sight if the
killing had been a righteous thing, and that God had done so, thus proving the deed in the
sight of heaven to have been a just vengeance upon those who had once made war upon the Saints
in Missouri.

With these and with many another disjointed memory of the day Joel Rae was cursed; of how Hamblin
the following spring had gathered a hundred and twenty skulls on the ground where the wolves
had left them, and buried them again; of how an officer from Camp Floyd had built a cairn on
the spot and erected a huge cross to the memory of the slain; of how the thing became so dire
in the minds of those who had done it, that more than one man lost his reason, and two were
known to have killed themselves to be rid of the death-cries of women.

But the clearest of all among the memories of the day itself was the prayer offered up as they
stood amid the heaps of fresh earth, after they had sworn the oath of secrecy; how God had
been thanked for delivering the enemy into their hands, and how new faith and better works
were promised to Him for this proof of His favour.

The memory of this prayer stayed with him many years: "Bless Brother Brigham--bless him; may
the heavens be opened unto him, and angels visit and instruct him. Clothe him with power to
defend Thy people and to overthrow all who may rise against us. Bless him in his basket and
in his store; multiply and increase him in wives, children, flocks and herds, houses and lands.
Make him very great to be a lawgiver and God to Thy people, and to command them in all things
whatsoever in the future as in the past."

Nor did he forget that, soon after he had listened to this prayer, and the forces had dispersed,
he had made two discoveries;--first, that his hair was whitening; second, that he could not
be alone at night and keep his reason.

CHAPTER XIX.

The Host of Israel Goes forth to Battle

He went north in answer to the call for soldiers. He went gladly. It promised activity--and
company.

A score of them left Cedar City with much warlike talk, with many ringing prophecies of confusion
to the army now marching against them, and to the man who had sent it. They cited Fremont,
Presidential candidate of the newly organised Republican party the year before, with his catch
phrase, "The abolition of slavery and polygamy, the twin relics of barbarism." Fremont had
been defeated. And there was Stephen A. Douglas, once their staunch friend and advocate in
Illinois; but the year before he had turned against them, styling polygamy "the loathsome ulcer
of the body politic," asserting that the people of Utah were bound by oath to recognise only
the authority of Brigham Young; that they were forming alliances with Indians and organising
Danite bands to rob and murder American citizens; and urging a rigid investigation into these
enormities. For this slander Brigham had hurled upon him the anathema of the priesthood, in
consequence of which Douglas had failed to secure even a nomination for the high office which
he sought.

And now Buchanan was in a way to draw upon himself that retribution which must ever descend
upon the foes of Israel. Brigham was at last to unleash the dogs of war. They recalled his
saying when they came into the valley, "If they will let us alone for ten years, we will ask
no odds of Uncle Sam or the Devil." The ten years had passed and the Devil was taking them
at their word. One of them recalled the prophecy of another inspired leader, Parley Pratt,
the Archer of Paradise: "Within ten years from now the people of this country who are not Mormons
will be entirely subdued by the Latter-day Saints or swept from the face of the earth; and
if this prophecy fails, then you may know the Book of Mormon is not true."

Their great day was surely at hand. Their God of Battles reigned. All through the Territory
the leaders preached, prayed, and taught nothing but war; the poets made songs only of war;
and the people sang only these. Public works and private were alike suspended, save the manufacture
of new arms, the repairing of old, and the sharpening of sabers and bayonets.

On the way, to fire their ardour, they were met by Brigham's proclamation. It concluded by
forbidding all armed forces of every description to enter the Territory under any pretence
whatever, and declaring martial law to exist until further notice. The little band hurried
on, eager to be at the front.

The day he reached Salt Lake City, Joel Rae was made major of militia. The following day, he
attended the meeting at the tabernacle. He needed, for reasons he did not fully explain to
himself, to receive fresh assurance of Brigham's infallibility, of his touch with the Holy
Ghost, of his goodness as well as his might; to be caught once more by the compelling magnetism
of his presence, the flash of his eye, and the inciting tones of his voice. All this he found.

"Is there," asked Brigham, "a collision between us and the United States? No, we have not collashed--that
is the word that sounds nearest to what I mean. But the thread is cut between us and we will
never gybe again, no, never--worlds without end. I am not going to have their troops here to
protect the priests and rabble in their efforts to drive us from the land we possess. The Lord
does not want us to be driven. He has said to me, 'If you will assert your rights and keep
my commandments, you shall never again be brought into bondage by your enemies.' The United
States says that their army is legal, but I say that such a statement is false as hell, and
that those States are as rotten as an old pumpkin that has been frozen seven times over and
then thawed in a harvest sun. We can't have that army here and have peace--you might as well
tell me you could make hell into a powder-house. And so we shall melt those troops away. I
promise you our enemies shall never 'slip the bow on old Bright's neck again.'"

Joel Rae was again under the sway of his old warlike feelings. Brigham had revived his fainting
faith. He went out into the noise and hurry of war preparations in a sort of intoxication.
Underneath he never ceased to be conscious of the dreadful specter that would not be gone--that
stood impassive and immovable as one of the mountains about him, waiting for him to come to
it and face it and live his day of reckoning,--the day of his own judgment upon himself. But
he drank thirstily of the martial draught and lived the time in a fever of tumultuous drunkenness
to the awful truth.

He saw to it that he was never alone by day or night. Once a new thought and a sudden hope
came to him, and he had been about to pray that in the campaign he was entering he might be
killed. But a second thought stayed him; he had no right to die until he had faced his own
judgment.

The army of Israel was now well organised. It had taken all able-bodied males between the ages
of eighteen and forty-five. There were a lieutenant-general, four generals, eleven colonels,
and six majors. In addition to the Saints' own forces there were the Indians, for Brigham had
told a messenger who came to ascertain his disposition toward the approaching army that he
would "no longer hold the Indians by the wrist." This messenger had suggested that, while the
army might be kept from entering the valley that winter, it would assuredly march in, the following
spring. Brigham's reply had not lacked the point that sharpened most of his words.

"Before we shall suffer what we have in times gone by we will burn and lay waste our improvements,
and you will find the desert here again. There will not be left one building, nor one foot
of lumber, nor a stick or tree or particle of grass or hay that will burn. I will lay this
valley utterly waste in the name of Israel's God. We have three years' provisions, which we
will cache, and then take to the mountains." The messenger had returned to Fort Bridger and
the measures of defense went forward in the valley.

Forces were sent into Echo Cañon, the narrow defile between the mountains through which an
army would have to pass. On the east side men were put to building stone ramparts as a protection
for riflemen. On the west, where the side was sloping, they dug pits for the same purpose.
They also built dams to throw large bodies of water along the west side of the cañon so that
an army would be forced to the east side; and here at the top of the cliff, great quantities
of boulders were placed so that a slight leverage would suffice to hail them down upon the
army as it marched below.

When word came that the invaders had crossed the Utah line, Brigham sent forward a copy of
his proclamation and a friendly note of warning to the officer in command. The officer who
received this note had replied somewhat curtly that the forces he commanded were in Utah by
order of the President of the United States and that their future movements would depend wholly
upon orders issued by competent military authority. Thus the issue was forced.

In addition to the defense of Echo Cañon, certain aggressive moves were made. To Joel Rae was
allotted command of one of these. His orders promised all he could wish of action. He read
them and felt something like his old truculent enthusiasm. God bless you and give you success.

"YOUR BROTHER IN CHRIST."

Forty-four men were placed under his command to perform this work, and all of them were soon
impressed, even to alarm, by the very evident reliance of their leader upon the God of Israel
rather than upon any merely human wisdom of his own.

The first capture was not difficult. After an all-night ride they came up with a supply-train
of twenty-five wagons drawn by oxen. The captain of this train was ordered to "go the other
way" until he reached the States. He started; but as he retraced his steps as often as they
moved away, they at length burned his train and left him.

And then the recklessness of the new-fledged major became manifest. When his scouts late in
the day reported a train of twenty-six wagons, he was advised by them that he ought not to
attack it with so small a force; but to this advice he was deaf, rebuking the men for their
little faith.

He allowed the train to proceed until after dark, and then drew cautiously near. Learning,
however, that the drivers were drunk, he had his force lie concealed for a time, fearing that
they might prove belligerent and thus compel him to shed blood, which he wished not to do.

At midnight the scouts reported that the train was drawn up in two lines for the night and
that all was quiet. He mounted his command and ordered an advance. Approaching the camp, they
discovered a fact that the scouts had failed to note; a second train had joined the first,
and the little host of Israel was now confronted by twice the anticipated force. This discovery
was made too late for them to retire unobserved. The men, however, expected their leader to
make some inquiry concerning the road and then ride on. But they had not plumbed the depth
of his faith.

As the force neared the camp-fire close to the wagons, the rear of the column was lost in the
darkness. What the teamsters about the fire saw was an apparently endless column of men advancing
upon them. Their leader halted the column, called for the captain of the train, ordered him
to have his men stack their arms, collect their property, and stand by under guard. Dismounting
from his horse, he fashioned a torch and directed one of the drivers to apply it to the wagons,
in order that "the Gentiles might spoil the Gentiles." By the time the teamsters had secured
their personal belongings and a little stock of provisions for immediate necessity the fifty
wagons were ablaze. The following day, on the Big Sandy, they destroyed another train and a
few straggling sutlers' wagons.

And so the campaign went forward. As the winter came on colder, the scouts brought in moving
tales of the enemy's discomfiture. Colonel Alexander of the Federal forces, deciding that the
cañons could be defended by the Saints, planned to approach Salt Lake City over a roundabout
route to the north. He started in heavy snow, cutting a road through the greasewood and sage-brush.
Often his men made but three miles a day, and his supply-train was so long that sometimes half
of it would be camped for the night before the rear wagons had moved. As there was no cavalry
in the force the hosts of Israel harassed them sorely on this march, on one day consecrating
eight hundred head of their oxen and driving them to Salt Lake.

Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the expedition, had also suffered greatly with his forces.
The early snows deprived his stock of forage, and the unusual cold froze many oxen and mules.

Lieutenant-Colonel Cooke of the Second Dragoons, with whom travelled the newly appointed governor,
was another to suffer. At Fort Laramie so many of his animals had dropped out that numbers
of his men were dismounted, and the ambulances used to carry grain. Night after night they
huddled at the base of cliffs in the fearful eddies of the snow, and heard above the blast
the piteous cries of their famished and freezing stock. Day after day they pushed against the
keen blades of the wind, toiling through frozen clouds and stinging ice blasts. The last thirty-five
miles to Fort Bridger had required fifteen days, and at one camp on Black's Fork, which they
called the "camp of Death," five hundred animals perished in a night.

Nor did the hardships of the troops end when they had all reached what was to be their winter
quarters. Still a hundred and fifteen miles from the City of the Saints, they were poorly housed
against the bitter cold, poorly fed, and insufficiently clothed, for the burning of the trains
by the Lord's hosts had reduced all supplies.

Reports of this distress were duly carried to Brigham and published to the Saints. Their soldiers
had made good their resolve to prevent the Federal army from passing the Wasatch Mountains.
Aggressive operations ceased for the winter, and the greater part of the militia returned to
their homes. A small outpost of fifty men under the command of Major Joel Rae--who had earnestly
requested this assignment--was left to guard the narrows of Echo Cañon and to keep watch over
the enemy during the winter. This officer was now persuaded that the Lord's hand was with them.
For the enemy had been wasted away even by the elements from the time he had crossed the forbidden
line.

In Salt Lake City that winter, the same opinion prevailed. They were henceforth to be the free
and independent State of Deseret.

"Do you want to know," asked Brigham, in the tabernacle, "what is to be done with the enemy
now on our borders? As soon as they start to come into our settlements, let sleep depart from
their eyes until they sleep in death! Men shall be secreted along the route and shall waste
them away in the name of the God of Battles. The United States will have to make peace with
us. Never again shall we make peace with them."

And they sang with fervour:--

  "By the mountains our Zion's surrounded,
     Her warriors are noble and brave;
   And their faith on Jehovah is founded,
     Whose power is mighty to save.
   Opposed by a proud, boasting nation,
     Their numbers compared may be few;
   But their Ruler is known through creation,
     And they'll always be faithful and true."

CHAPTER XX.

How the Lion of the Lord Roared Soft

But with the coming of spring some fever that had burned in the blood of the Saints from high
to low was felt to be losing its heat. They had held the Gentile army at bay during the winter--with
the winter's help. But spring was now melting the snows. Reports from Washington, moreover,
indicated that a perverse generation in the States had declined to accept the decrees of Israel's
God without further proofs of their authenticity.

With a view to determining this issue, Congress had voted more money for troops. Three thousand
men were to march to the reinforcement of the army of Johnston on Black's Fork; forty-five
hundred wagons were to transport their supplies; and fifty thousand oxen and four thousand
mules were to pull these wagons. War, in short, was to be waged upon this Israel hidden in
the chamber of the mountains. To Major Rae, watching on the outposts of Zion from behind the
icy ramparts of Echo Cañon, the news was welcome, even enlivening. The more glory there would
be in that ultimate triumph which the Lord was about to secure for them.

In Brigham and the other leaders, however, this report induced deep thought. And finally, on
a day, they let it be known that there could no longer be any thought of actual war with the
armies of the Gentile. Joel Rae in Echo Cañon was incredulous. There must be battle given.
The Lord would make them prevail; the living God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, would
hold them up. And battle must be given for another reason, though he hardly dared let that
reason be plain to himself. For only by continuing the war, only by giving actual battle to
armed soldiers, by fighting to the end if need be--only so could that day in Mountain Meadows
be made to appear as anything but--he shuddered and could not name it. Even if actual war were
to be fought on and on for years, he believed that day could hardly be justified; but at least
it could be made in years of fighting to stand less horribly high and solitary. They must fight,
he thought, even if it were to lose all. But the Lord would stay them. How much more wicked
and perverse, then, to reject the privilege!

When he heard that the new governor, who had been in the snow with Johnston's army all winter,
was to enter Salt Lake City and take his office--a Gentile officer to sit on the throne of
Brigham--he felt that the Ark of the Covenant had been thrown down. "Let us not," he implored
Brigham in a letter sent him from Echo Cañon, "be again dragooned into servile obedience to
any one less than the Christ of God!"

But Brigham's reply was an order to pass the new governor through Echo Cañon. According to
the terms of this order he was escorted through at night, in a manner to convince him that
he was passing between the lines of a mighty and far-flung host. Fires were kindled along the
heights and the small force attending him was cunningly distributed and duplicated, a few of
its numbers going ahead from time to time, halting the rest of the party and demanding the
countersign.

Joel Rae found himself believing that he could now have been a fiercer Lion of the Lord than
Brigham was; for he would have fought, while Brigham was stooping to petty strategies--as if
God were needing to rely upon deceits.

He was only a little appeased when, on going to Salt Lake City, he learned Brigham's intentions
more fully. The new governor had been installed; but the army of Johnston was to turn back.
This was Brigham's first promise. Soon, however, this was modified. The government, it appeared,
was bent upon quartering its troops in the valley; and Zion, therefore, would be again led
into the wilderness. The earlier promise was repeated--and the earlier threat--to the peace
commissioners now sent on from Washington.

"We are willing those troops should come into our country, but not stay in our city. They may
pass through if need be, but must not be quartered within forty miles of us. And if they come
here to disturb this people, before they reach here this city will be in ashes; every house
and tree and shrub and blade of grass will be destroyed. Here are twenty years' gathering,
but it will all burn. You will have won back the wilderness, barren again as on the day we
entered it, but you will not have conquered the people. Our wives and children will go to the
cañons and take shelter in the mountains, while their husbands and sons will fight you. You
will be without fuel, without subsistence for yourselves or forage for your animals. You will
be in a strange land, while we know every foot of it. We will haunt and harass you and pick
you off by day and by night, and, as God lives, we will waste your army away."

This was hopeful. Here at least was another chance to suffer persecution, and thus, in a measure,
atone for any monstrous wrong they might have done. He hoped the soldiers would come despoiling,
plundering, thus compelling them to use the torch and to flee. Another forced exodus would
help to drive certain memories from his mind and silence the cries that were now beginning
to ring in his ears.

Obedient to priestly counsel, the Saints declined, in the language of Brigham, "to trust again
in Punic faith." In April they began to move south, starting from the settlements on the north.
During that and the two succeeding months thirty thousand of them left their homes. They took
only their wagons, bedding, and provisions, leaving their other possessions to the mercy of
the expected despoiler. Before locking the doors of their houses for the last time, they strewed
shavings, straw, and other combustibles through the rooms so that the work of firing the city
could be done quickly. A score of men were left behind to apply the torch the moment it became
necessary,--should a gate be swung open or a latch lifted by hostile hands. Their homes and
fields and orchards might be given back to the desert from which they had been won; but never
to the Gentile invaders.

To the south the wagons crept, day after day, to some other unknown desert which their prophet
should choose, and where, if the Lord willed, they would again charm orchards and gardens and
green fields from the gray, parched barrens.

Late in June the army of Johnston descended Emigration Cañon, passed through the echoing streets
of the all but deserted city and camped on the River Jordan. Why thorns me if you became to go out and
stare the eyes which could stare it spear in postal-orders? "That'the start this half-crown

 There he could be alone; there face God and his own conscience
and have his inmost soul declare the truth about himself. In his sadness he would have liked
to lead the people with him, lead them away from some evil, some falsity that had crept in
about them; he knew not what it was nor how it had come, but Zion had been defiled. Something
was gone from the Church, something from Brigham, something from himself,--something, it almost
seemed, even from the God of Israel. When the summer waned, his plan was formed to go to one
of the southern settlements to live. Brigham had approved. The Church needed new blood there.

He rode out of the city one early morning in September, facing to the south over the rolling
valley that lay between the hills now flaunting their first autumn colours. He was in haste
to go, yet fearful of what he should meet there.

A little out of the city he passed a man from the south, huddled high on the seat under the
bow of his wagon-cover, who sang as he went one of the songs that had been so popular the winter
before:--

  "Old squaw-killer Harney is on the way
   The Mormon people for to slay.
   Now if he comes, the truth I'll tell,
   Our boys will drive him down to hell--
       Du dah, du dah, day!"

He smiled grimly as the belated echo of war came back to him.

CHAPTER XXI.

The Blood on the Page

Along the level lane between the mountain ranges he went, a lane that runs almost from Bear
Creek on the north to the Colorado on the south, with a width of twenty miles or so. But for
Joel Rae it became a ride down the valley of lost illusions. Some saving grace of faith was
gone from the people. He passed through sturdy little settlements, bowered in gardens and orchards,
and girded about by now fertile acres where once had been the bare, gray desert. Slowly, mile
by mile, the Saints had pushed down the valley, battling with the Indians and the elements
for every acre of land they gained. Yet it seemed to him now that they had achieved but a mere
Godless prosperity. They had worked a miracle of abundance in the desert--but of what avail?
For the soul of their faith was gone. He felt or heard the proof of it on every hand.

Through Battle Creek, Provo, and Springville he went; through Spanish Fork, Payson, Salt Creek,
and Fillmore. He stopped to preach at each place, but he did it perfunctorily, and with shame
for himself in his secret heart. Some impalpable essence of spirituality was gone from himself
and from the people. He felt himself wickedly agreeing with a pessimistic elder at Fillmore,
who remarked: "I tell you what, Brother Rae, it seems like when the Book of Mormon goes again'
the Constitution of the United States, there's sure to be hell to pay, and the Saints allus
has to pay it." He could not tell the man in words of fire, as once he would have done, that
they had been punished for lack of faith.

Another told him it was madness to have thought they could "whip" the United States. "Why,"
said this one, "they's more soldiers back there east of the Missouri than there is fiddlers
in hell!" By the orthodox teachings of the time, the good man of Israel had thus indicated
an overwhelming host.

He passed sadly on. They would not understand that they had laid by and forgotten their impenetrable
armour of faith.

Between Beaver and Paragonah that day, toiling intently along the dusty road in the full blaze
of the August sun, he met a woman,--a tall, strong creature with a broad, kind face, burned
and seamed and hardened by life in the open. Yet it was a face that appealed to him by its
look of simple, trusting earnestness. Her dress was of stout, gray homespun, her shoes were
coarse and heavy, and she was bareheaded, her gray, straggling hair half caught into a clumsy
knot at the back of her head. She turned out to pass him without looking up, but he stopped
his horse and dismounted before her. It seemed to him that here was one whose faith was still
fresh, and to such a one he needed to talk. He called to her:

"You need something on your head; you are burned."

She looked up, absently at first, as if neither seeing nor hearing him. Then intelligence came
into her eyes.

"You mean my Timothy needs something on his head--poor man! You see he broke out of the house
last night, because the Bishop told him I was to take another husband. Cruel! Oh, so cruel!--the
poor foolish man, he believed it, and he cared so for me. He thought I was bringing home a
new man with me--a new wedding for time and eternity, to build myself up in the Kingdom--a
new wedding night--with him sitting off, cold and neglected. But something burst in his head.
It made a roar like the mill at Cedar Creek when it grinds the corn--just like that. So he
went out into the cold night--it was sleeting--thinking I'd never miss him, you see, me being
fondled and made over by the new man--wouldn't miss him till morning." A scowl of indignation
darkened her face for an instant, and she paused, looking off toward the distant hills. 

She abode city whatsoever should not be floated of Arm. They see Card. "Mother had been There"

and to cover the camp of Pacific who?"


He dreamed that night that the foundations of the great temple they were building had crumbled.
And when he brought new stones to replace the old, these too fell away to dust in his hands.

The next evening he reached Cedar City. Memories of this locality began to crowd back upon
him with torturing clearness; especially of the morning he had left Hamblin's ranch. As he
mounted his horse two of the children saved from the wagon-train had stood near him,--a boy
of seven and another a little older, the one who had fought so viciously with him when he was
separated from the little girl. He remembered that the younger of the two boys had forgotten
all but the first of his name. He had told them that it was John Calvin--something; he could
not remember what, so great had been his fright; the people at the ranch, because of his forlorn
appearance, had thereupon named him John Calvin Sorrow.

These two boys had watched him closely as he mounted his horse, and the older one had called
to him, "When I get to be a man, I'm coming back with a gun and kill you till you are dead
yourself," and the other, little John Calvin Sorrow, had clenched his fists and echoed the
threat, "We'll come back here and kill you! Mormons is worse'n Indians!"

He had ridden quickly away, not noting that some of the men standing by had looked sharply
at the boys and then significantly at one another. One of those who had been present, whom
he now met, told him of these two boys.

"You see, Elder, the orders from headquarters was to save only them that was too young to give
evidence in a court. But these two was very forward and knowing. They shouldn't have been kept
in the first place. So two men--no need of naming names--took both of them out one night. They
got along all right with the little one, the one they called John Calvin Sorrow--only the little
cuss kicked and scrambled so that we both had to see to him for a minute, and when we was ready
for the other, there he was at least ten rods away, a-legging it into the scrub oak. Well,
they looked and looked and hunted around till daybreak, but he'd got away all right, the moon
going under a cloud. They tracked him quite a ways when it come light, till his tracks run
into the trail of a big band of Navajos that had been up north trading ponies and was going
back south. He was the one that talked so much about you, but you needn't ever have any fear
of his talking any more. He'd be done for one way or another."

For the first time in his life that night, he was afraid to pray,--afraid even to give thanks
that others were sleeping in the room with him so that he could hear their breathing and know
that he was not alone.

He was up betimes to press on to the south, again afraid to pray, and dreading what was still
in store for him. For sooner or later he would have to be alone in the night. Thus far since
that day in the Meadows he had slept near others, whether in cabins or in camp, in some freighter's
wagon or bivouacking in the snows of Echo Cañon. Each night he had been conscious, at certain
terrible moments of awakening, that others were near him. He heard their breathing, or in the
silence a fire's light had shown him a sleeping face, the lines of a form, or an arm tossed
out. What would happen on the night he found himself alone, he knew not--death, or the loss
of reason. He knew what the torture would be,--the shrieks of women in deadly terror, the shrill
cries of children, the low, tense curses of men, the rattle of shots, the yells of Indians,
the heavy, sickening smell of blood, the still forms fallen in strange positions of ease, the
livid faces distorted to grins. He had not been able to keep the sounds from his ears, but
thus far the things themselves had stayed behind him, moving always, crawling, writhing, even
stepping furtively close at his back, so that he could feel their breath on his neck. When
the time came that these should move around in front of him, he thought it would have to be
the end. They would go before him, a wild, bleeding, raving procession, until they tore his
heart from his breast. One sight he feared most of all,--a bronzed arm with a wide silver bracelet
at the wrist, the hand clutching and waving before him heavy strands of long, yellow hair with
a gory patch at the end,--living hair that writhed and undulated to catch the light, coiling
about the arm like a golden serpent.

His way lay through the Meadows, yet he hardly realised this until he was fairly on the ground
in the midst of a thousand evil signs of the day. Here, a year after, were skulls and whitening
bones, some in heaps, some scattered through the sage-brush where the wolves had left them.
Even more terrifying than these were certain traces caught here and there on the low scrub
oaks along the way,--children's sunbonnets; shreds of coarse lace, muslin, and calico; a child's
shoe, the tattered sleeve of a woman's dress--all faded, dead, whipped by the wind.

He pressed through it all with set jaws, trying to keep his eyes fixed upon the ground beyond
his horse's head; but his ears were at the mercy of the cries that rang from every thicket.

Once out of it, he rode hard, for it must not come yet--his first night alone. By dusk he had
reached the new settlement of Amalon, a little off the main road in a valley of the Pine Mountains.
Here he sought the house where he had left the child. When he had picketed his horse he went
in and had her brought to him,--a fresh little flower-like woman-child, with hair and eyes
that told of her mother, with reminders of her mother's ways as she stood before him, a waiting
poise of the head, a lift of the chin. They looked at each other in the candle-light, the child
standing by the woman who had brought her, looking up at him curiously, and he not daring to
touch her or go nearer. She became uneasy and frightened at last, under his scrutiny, and when
the woman would have held her from running away, began to cry, so that he gave the word to
let her go. She ran quickly into the other room of the cabin, from which she called back with
tears of indignation in her voice, "You're not my papa--not my real papa!"

When the people were asleep, he sat before the blaze in the big fireplace, on the hearth cleanly
swept with its turkey-wing and buffalo-tail. There was to be one more night of his reprieve
from solitude. The three women of the house and the man were sleeping around the room in bunks.
The child's bed had been placed near him on the floor after she slept, as he had asked it to
be. He had no thought of sleep for himself. He was too intensely awake with apprehension. On
the floor beside his chair was a little bundle the woman had brought him,--the bundle he had
found loosened by her side, that day, with the trinkets scattered about and the limp-backed
little Bible lying open where it had fallen.

He picked the bundle up and untied it, touching the contents timidly. He took up the Bible
last, and as he did so a memory flooded back upon him that sickened him and left him trembling.
It was the book he had given her on her seventeenth birthday, the one she had told him she
was keeping when they parted that morning at Nauvoo. He knew the truth before he opened it
at the yellowed fly-leaf and read in faded ink, "From Joel to Prudence on this day when she
is seventeen years old--June 2d, 1843."

In a daze of feeling he turned the pages, trying to clear his mind, glancing at the chapter
headings as he turned,--"Abram is Justified by Faith," "God Instructeth Isaac," "Pharaoh's
Heart Is Hardened," "The Laws of Murder," "The Curses for Disobedience." He turned rapidly
and at last began to run the leaves from between his thumb and finger, and then, well over
in the book something dark caught his eye. He turned the leaves back again to see what it was;
but not until the book was opened flat before him and he held the page close to the light did
he see what it was his eye had caught. A wash of blood was across the page.

He stared blankly at the reddish, dark stain, as if its spell had been hypnotic. Little by
little he began to feel the horror of it, remembering how he picked the book up from where
it had fallen before her. Slowly, but with relentless certainty, his mind cleared to what he saw.

   "And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
    likewise."

Again and again he read them. They were illumined with a strangely terrible meaning by the
blood of her he had loved and sworn to keep himself clean for.

He could no longer fight off the truth. It was facing him now in all its nakedness, monstrous
to obscenity, demanding its due measure from his own soul's blood. He aroused himself, shivering,
and looked out into the room where the shadows lay heavy, and from whence came the breathing
of the sleepers. He picked up the now sputtering candle, set in its hole bored in a block of
wood, and held it up for a last look at the little woman-child. He was full of an agony of
wonder as he gazed, of piteous questioning why this should be as it was. The child stirred
and flung one arm over her eyes as if to hide the light. He put out the candle and set it down.
Then stooping over, he kissed the pillow beside the child's head and stepped lightly to the
door. He had come to the end of his subterfuges--he could no longer delay his punishment.

Outside the moon was shining, and his horse moved about restlessly. He put on the saddle and
rode off to the south, galloping rapidly after he reached the highway. Off there was a kindly
desert where a man could take in peace such punishment as his body could bear and his soul
decree; and where that soul could then pass on in decent privacy to be judged by its Maker.

CHAPTER XXII.

The Picture in the Sky

If something of the peace of the night-silence came to him as he rode, he counted it only the
peace of surrender and despair. He knew now that he had been cheated of all his great long-nursed
hopes of some superior exaltation. Nor this only; for he had sinned unforgivably and incurred
perdition. He who had fasted, prayed, and endured, waiting for his Witness, for the spreading
of the heavens and the glory of the open vision, had overreached himself and was cast down.

When at last he slowed his horse to a walk, it was the spring of the day. The moon had gone,
and over on his left a soft grayness began to show above the line of the hills. The light grew
until it glowed with the fire of opals; through the tree-tops ran little stirs of wakefulness,
and all about him were faint, furtive rustlings and whispers of the new day. Then in this glorified
dusk of the dawn a squirrel loosed his bark of alarm, a crested jay screamed in answer, and
he knew his hour of atonement was come.

He pressed forward again toward the desert, eager to be on with it. The page with the wash
of blood across it seemed to take on a new vividness in the stronger light. Under the stain,
the letters of the words were magnified before his mind,--"And as ye would that men should
do to you--" It seemed to him that the blood through which they came heated the words so that
they burned his eyes.

An hour after daybreak the trail led him down out of the hills by a little watercourse to the
edge of the desert. Along the sides of this the chaparral grew thickly, and the spring by which
he halted made a little spot of green at the edge of the gray. But out in front of him was
the infinite stretch of death, far sweeps of wind-furrowed sand burning under a sun made sullen
red by the clouds of fine dust in the air. Sparsely over the dull surface grew the few shrubs
that could survive the heat and dryness,--stunted, unlovely things of burr, spine, thorn, or
saw-edged leaf,--all bent one ways by the sand blown against them,--bristling cactus and crouching
mesquite bushes.

In the vast open of the blue above, a vulture wheeled with sinister alertness; and far out
among the dwarfed growing things a coyote skulked knowingly. The weird, phantom-like beauty
of it stole upon him, torn as he was, while he looked over the dry, flat reaches. It was a
good place to die in, this lifeless waste languishing under an angry sun. And he knew how it
would come. Out to the south, as many miles as he should have strength to walk, away from any
road or water-hole, a great thirst would come, and then delirium, perhaps bringing visions
of cool running water and green trees. He would hurry toward these madly until he stumbled
and fell and died. Then would come those cynical scavengers of the desert, the vulture wheeling
lower, the coyote skulking nearer, pausing suspiciously to sniff and to see if he moved. Then
a few poor bones, half-buried by the restless sand, would be left to whiten and crumble into
particles of the same desert dust he looked upon. As for his soul, he shuddered to think its
dissolution could not also be made as sure.

He stood looking out a long time, held by the weak spirit of a hope that some reprieve might
come, from within or from on high. But he saw only the page wet with blood, and the words that
burned through it into his eyes; heard only the cries of women in their death-agony and the
stealthy movements of the bleeding shapes behind him. There was no ray of hope to his eye nor
note of it to his ear--only the cries and the rustlings back of him, driving him out.

At last he gave his horse water, tied the bridle-rein to the horn of the saddle, headed him
back over the trail to the valley and turned him loose. Then, after a long look toward the
saving green of the hills, he started off through the yielding sand, his face white and haggard
but hard-set. He was already weakened by fasting and loss of sleep, and the heat and dryness
soon told upon him as the chill was warmed from the morning air.

When he had walked an hour, he felt he must stop, at least to rest. He looked back to see how
far he had come. He was disappointed by the nearness of the hills; they seemed but a stone's
throw away. If delirium came now he would probably wander back to the water. He lay down, determining
to gather strength for many more miles. The sand was hot under him, and the heat of a furnace
was above, but he lay with his head on his arm and his hat pulled over his face. Soon he was
half-asleep, so that dreams would alternate with flashes of consciousness; or sometimes they
merged, so that he would dream he had wandered into a desert, or that the stifling heat of
a desert came to him amid the snows of Echo Cañon. He awakened finally with a cry, brushing
from before his eyes a mass of yellow hair that a dark hand shook in his face.

He sat up, looked about a moment, and was on his feet again to the south, walking in the full
glare of the sun, with his shadow now straight behind him. He went unsteadily at first, but
soon felt new vigour from his rest.

He walked another hour, then turned, and was again disappointed--it was such a little distance;
yet he knew now he must be too far out to find his way back when the madness came. So it was
with a little sigh of contentment that he lay down again to rest or to take what might come.

Again he lay with his head on his arm in the scorching sands, with his hat above his face,
and again his dreams alternated with consciousness of the desolation about him--alternated
and mingled so that he no longer knew when he did not sleep. And again he was tortured to wakefulness,
to thirst, and to heat, by the yellow hair brandished before him.

He sat up until he was quite awake, and then sank back upon the sand again, relieved to find
that he felt too weak to walk further. His mind had become suddenly cleared so that he seemed
to see only realities, and those in their just proportions. He knew he had passed sentence
of death upon himself, knew he had been led to sin by his own arrogance of soul. All the was a
master, but not success. It has been secured free if Exeter may have been postponed with south had

 And this time the lines were coherent.
He, the dying sinner, had caught, clearly and positively for one awful second in that sky,
the flashing impression of a cross. It faded as soon as it came, vanished while he gazed, leaving
him in gasping, fainting wonder at the marvel.

And then, before he could think or question himself, the sky once more yielded its vision;
again that image of a cross stayed for a second in his eyes, and this time he thought there
were figures about it. Some picture was trying to show itself to him. Still reaching his body
forward, gazing fearfully, his aroused body pulsing swiftly to the wonder of the thing, he
began to pray again, striving to keep his excitement under.

"O God, have mercy on me, a sinner!"

Slowly at first, it grew before his fixed eyes, then quickly, so that at the last there was
a complete picture where but an instant before had been but a meaningless mass of line and
colour. Set on a hill were many low, square, flat-topped houses, brown in colour against the
gray ground about them. In front of these houses was a larger structure of the same material,
a church-like building such as he had once seen in a picture, with a wooden cross at the top.
In an open square before this church were many moving persons strangely garbed, seeming to
be Indians. They surged for a moment about the door of the church, then parted to either side
as if in answer to a signal, and he saw a procession of the same people coming with bowed heads,
scourging themselves with short whips and thorned branches. At their head walked a brown-cowled
monk, holding aloft before him a small cross, attached by a chain to his waist. As he led the
procession forward, another crowd, some of them being other brown-cowled monks, parted before
the church door, and there, clearly before his wondering eyes was erected a great cross upon
which he saw the crucified Saviour.

He saw those in the procession form about the cross and fling themselves upon the ground before
it, while all the others round about knelt. He saw the monk, standing alone, raise the smaller
cross in his hands above them, as if in blessing. High above it all, he saw the crucified one,
the head lying over on the shoulder.

Then he, too, flung himself face down in the sand, weeping hysterically, calling wildly, and
trying again to utter his prayer. Once more he dared to look up, in some sudden distrust of
his eyes. Again he saw the prostrate figures, the kneeling ones farther back, the brown-cowled
monk with arms upraised, and the face of agony on the cross.

He was down in the sand again, now with enough control of himself to cry out his prayer over
and over. When he next looked, the vision was gone. Only a few light clouds ruffled the southern
horizon.

He sank back on the sands in an ecstasy. His Witness had come--not as he thought it would,
in a moment of spiritual uplift; but when he had been sunk by his own sin to fearful depths.
Nor had it brought any message of glory for himself, of gifts or powers. Only the mission of
suffering and service and suffering again at the end. But it was enough.

How long he lay in the joy of the realisation he never knew, but sleep or faintness at last
overcame him.

He was revived by the sharp chill of night, and sat up to find his mind clear, alert, and active
with new purposes. He had suffered greatly from thirst, so that when he tried to say a prayer
of thanksgiving he could not move his swollen tongue. He was weakened, too, but the freezing
cold of the desert night aroused all his latent force. He struggled to his feet, and laid a
course by the light of the moon back to the spring he had left in the morning. How he reached
the hills again he never knew, nor how he made his way over them and back to the settlement.
But there he lay sick for many days, his mind, when he felt it at all, tossing idly upon the
great sustaining consciousness of that vision in the desert.

The day which he next remembered clearly, and from which he dated his new life, was one when
he was back in the Meadows. He had ridden there in the first vagueness and weakness of his
recovery, without purpose, yet feeling that he must go. What he found there made him believe
he had been led to the spot. Stark against the glow of the western sky as he rode up, was a
huge cross. He stopped, staring in wonder, believing it to be another vision; but it stayed
before him, rigid, bare, and uncompromising. He left his horse and climbed up to it.

On the cross itself was carved in deep letters:--

"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."

He fell on his knees at the foot and prayed, not weeping nor in any fever of fear, but as one
knowing his sin and the sin of his Church. The burden of his prayer was, "O God, my own sin
cannot be forgiven--I know it well--but let me atone for the sins of this people and let me
guide them aright. Let me die on this cross a hundred deaths for each life they put out, or
as many more as shall be needed to save them."

He was strong in his faith again, conscious that he himself was lost, but burning to save others,
and hopeful, too, for he believed that a miracle had been vouchsafed to him in the desert.

Nor would the good padre, at the head of his procession of penitents in his little mission
out across the desert, have doubted less that it was a miracle than did this unhappy apostle
of Joseph Smith, had he known the circumstance of its timeliness; albeit he had become familiar
with such phenomena of light and air in the desert.

CHAPTER XXIII.

The Sinner Chastens himself

How to offer the greatest sacrifice--how to do the greatest service--these had become his problems.
He concerned himself no longer with his own exaltation either in this world or the world to come.

He resolved to stay south, fearing vaguely that in the North he would be in conflict with the
priesthood. He knew not how; he felt that he was still sound in his faith, but he felt, too,
some undefined antagonism between himself and those who preached in the tabernacle. For his
home he chose the settlement of Amalon, set in a rich little valley between the shoulders of
the Pine Mountains.

Late in October there was finished for him on the outer edge of the town, near the bank of
a little hill-born stream, a roomy log-house, mud-chinked, with a water-tight roof of spruce
shakes and a floor of whipsawed plank,--a residence fit for one of the foremost teachers in
the Church, an Elder after the Order of Melchisedek, an eloquent preacher and one true to the
blessed Gods. At one end of the cabin, a small room was partitioned off and a bunk built in
it. A chair and a water-basin on a block comprised its furniture. This room he reserved for
himself.

As to the rest of the house, his ideas were at first cloudy. He knew only that he wished to
serve. Gradually, however, as his mind worked over the problem, the answer came with considerable
clearness. He thought about it much on his way north, for he was obliged to make the trip to
Salt Lake City to secure supplies for the winter, some needed articles of furniture for the
house, and his wagons and stock.

He was helped in his thinking on a day early in the journey. Near a squalid hut on the outskirts
of Cedar City he noticed a woman staggering under an armful of wood. She was bareheaded, with
hair disordered, her cheeks hollowed, and her skin yellow and bloodless. He remembered the
tale he had heard when he came down. He thought she must be that wife of Bishop Snow who had
been put away. He rode up to the cabin as the woman threw her wood inside. She was weak and
wretched-looking in the extreme.

"I am Elder Rae. I want to know if you would care to go to Amalon with me when I come back.
If you do, you can have a home there as long as you like. It would be easier for you than here."

She had looked up quickly at him in much embarrassment. His only critique was that, undoubtedly of an conjurer of CANTERBURY the
"opaque mediæval" mode of control, do he should choose to style it
the rate-modern technology of the exoneration of opprobrium.

 The left half of her face was disfigured by
a huge flaming scar, and he saw that she had but one hand.

"Who was that woman?" he asked Brigham, after they had chatted a little of other matters.

"That's poor Christina Lund. You ought to remember her. She was in your hand-cart party. She's
having a pretty hard time of it. You see, she froze off one hand, so now she can't work much,
and then she froze her face, so she ain't much for looks any longer--in fact, I wouldn't say
Christina was much to start with, judging from the half of her face that's still good--and
so, of course, she hasn't been able to marry. The Church helps her a little now and then, but
what troubles her most is that she'll lose her glory if she ain't married. You see, she ain't
a worker and she ain't handsome, so who's going to have her sealed to him?"

"I remember her now. She pushed the cart with her father in it from the Platte crossing, at
Fort Laramie, clear over to Echo Cañon, when all the fingers of one hand came off on the bar
of the cart one afternoon; and then her hand had to be amputated. Brother Brigham, she shouldn't
be cheated of her place in the Kingdom."

"Well, she ain't capable, and she ain't a pretty person, so what can she do?"

"I believe if the Lord is willing I will have her sealed to me."

"It will be your own doings, Brother Rae. I wouldn't take it on myself to counsel that woman
to anybody."

"I feel I must do it, Brother Brigham."

"Well, so be it if you say. She can be sealed to you and be a star in your crown forever. But
I hope, now that you've begun to build up your kingdom, you'll do a little better, next time.
There's a lot of pretty good-looking young women came in with a party yesterday--"

 Then the Devil entered, in black
silk knee-breeches, approaching with many blandishments the woman who was enacting the rôle
of Eve. The sin followed, and the expulsion from the garden.

After this impressive spectacle, Joel and the rapturous Christina were taught many signs, grips,
and passwords, without which one may not pass by the gatekeepers of heaven. They were sworn
also to avenge the murder of Joseph Smith upon the Gentiles who had done it, and to teach their
children to do the same; to obey without questioning or murmur the commands of the priesthood;
and never to reveal these secret rites under penalty of having their throats cut from ear to
ear and their hearts and tongues cut out.

When this oath had been taken, they passed into a room containing a long, low altar covered
with red velvet. At one end, in an armchair, sat Brigham, no longer in the rôle of God, but
in his proper person of Prophet, Seer, and Revelator. They knelt on either side of this altar,
and, with hands clasped above it in the secret grip last given to them, they were sealed for
time and eternity.

From the altar they went to the wagons and began their journey south. Christina came out of
the endowment-house, glowing, as to one side of her face. She was, also, in a state of daze
that left her able to say but little. Proud and happy and silent, her sole remark, the first
day of the trip, was: "Brigham--now--he make such a lovely, bee-yoo-tiful God in heaven!"

Nor, it soon appeared, was she ever talkative. The second day, too, she spoke but once, which
was when a sudden heavy shower swept down from the hills and caught her some distance from
the wagons, helping to drive the cattle. Then, although she was drenched, she only said: "It
make down somet'ing, I t'ink!"

For this taciturnity her husband was devoutly thankful. He had married her to secure her place
in the Kingdom and a temporal home, and not otherwise did he wish to be concerned about her.
He was glad to note, however, that she seemed to be of a happy disposition; which he did at
certain times when her eyes beamed upon him from a face radiant with gratitude.

But his work of service had only begun. As they went farther south he began to make inquiries
for the wandering wife of Elder Tench. He came upon her at length as she was starting north
from Beaver at dusk. He prevailed upon her to stop with his party.

"I don't mind to-night, sir, but I must be off betimes in the morning."

But in the morning he persuaded her to stay with them.

"Your husband is out of the country now, but he's coming back soon, and he will stop first
at my house when he does come. So stay with me there and wait for him."

She was troubled by this at first, but at last agreed.

"If you're sure he will come there first--"

She refused to ride in the wagon, however, preferring to walk, and strode briskly all day in
the wake of the cattle.

At Parowan he made inquiries for Tom Potwin, that other derelict, and was told that he had
gone south. Him, too, they overtook on the road next day, and persuaded to go with them to a home.

When they reached Cedar City a halt was made while he went for the other woman--not without
some misgiving, for he remembered that she was still young. But his second view of her reassured
him--the sallow, anemic face, the skin drawn tightly over the cheek-bones, the drooping shoulders,
the thin, forlorn figure. Even the certainty that her life of hardship was ended, that she
was at least sure not to die of privation, had failed to call out any radiance upon her. They
were married by a local Bishop, Joel's first wife placing the hand of the second in his own,
as the ceremony required. Then with his wives, his charges, his wagons, and his cattle he continued
on to the home he had made at the edge of Amalon.

Among the women there was no awkwardness or inharmony; they had all suffered; and the two wives
tactfully humoured the whims of the insane woman. On the day they reached home, the husband
took them to the door of his own little room.

"All that out there is yours," he said. "Make the best arrangements you can. This is my place;
neither of you must ever come in here."

They busied themselves in unpacking the supplies that had been brought, and making the house
home-like. The big gray woman had already gone down the road toward the settlement to watch
for her husband, promising, however, to return at nightfall. The other derelict helped the
women in their work, doing with a childish pleasure the things they told him to do. The second
wife occasionally paused in her tasks to look at him from eyes that were lighted to strange
depths; but he had for her only the unconcerned, unknowing look that he had for the others.

At night the master of the house, when they had assembled, instructed them briefly in the threefold
character of the Godhead. Then, when he had made a short prayer, he bade them good night and
went to his room. Here he permitted himself a long look at the fair young face set in the little
gilt oval of the rubber case. Then, as if he had forgotten himself, he fell contritely to his
knees beside the bunk and prayed that this face might never remind him of aught but his sin;
that he might have cross after cross added to his burden until the weight should crush him;
and that this might atone, not for his own sins, which must be punished everlastingly, but
in some measure for the sins of his misguided people.

In the outer room his wives, sitting together before the big fireplace, were agreeing that
he was a good man. 

Fortuitously, his horse, being "lean," was the fair for the "old subspecies."
The courier but retentive aught.

The bridle was punished around individual, and all his property
if never have made that the thing that might be made from him crush
aught without his being made was his bearskin had a bag,-- though
this last was under his sin-bolster.

Nothing thus was not good knees. The shrub but he lay up at period have forgotten to his despatches
within privacy, his saddle, and his horse near him.
 She looked up at him fearlessly, questioningly,
but with no sign of friendliness. He saw and felt her mother in all her being, in her eyes
and hair, in the lines of her soft little face, and indefinably in her way of standing or moving.
He was seized with a sudden fear that the mother watched him secretly out of the child's eyes,
and with the child's lips might call to him accusingly, with what wild cries of anguish and
reproach he dared not guess. He strove to say something to her, but his lips were dry, and
he made only some half-articulate sound, trying to force a smile of assurance.

Then the child spoke, her serious, questioning eyes upon him unwaveringly.

"Are you a damned Mormon?"
