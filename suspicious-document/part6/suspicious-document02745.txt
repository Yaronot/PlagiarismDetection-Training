There was one odd piece of practical metaphysics which accompanied what I may call the depth,
if I must not call it the intensity, of my abstraction.  What philosophers call ME and NOT-ME,
EGO and NON EGO, preoccupied me whether I would or no.  There was less ME and more NOT-ME than
I was accustomed to expect.  I looked on upon somebody else, who managed the paddling; I was
aware of somebody else's feet against the stretcher; my own body seemed to have no more intimate
relation to me than the canoe, or the river, or the river banks.  Nor this alone:  something
inside my mind, a part of my brain, a province of my proper being, had thrown off allegiance
and set up for itself, or perhaps for the somebody else who did the paddling.  I had dwindled
into quite a little thing in a corner of myself.  I was isolated in my own skull.  Thoughts
presented themselves unbidden; they were not my thoughts, they were plainly some one else's;
and I considered them like a part of the landscape.  I take it, in short, that I was about
as near Nirvana as would be convenient in practical life; and if this be so, I make the Buddhists
my sincere compliments; 'tis an agreeable state, not very consistent with mental brilliancy,
not exactly profitable in a money point of view, but very calm, golden, and incurious, and
one that sets a man superior to alarms.  It may be best figured by supposing yourself to get
dead drunk, and yet keep sober to enjoy it.  I have a notion that open-air labourers must spend
a large portion of their days in this ecstatic stupor, which explains their high composure
and endurance.  A pity to go to the expense of laudanum, when here is a better paradise for
nothing!

This frame of mind was the great exploit of our voyage, take it all in all.  It was the farthest
piece of travel accomplished. The conduct of the two shores on occasion, was sufficiently characteristic

Goldsmith, could "swish my trumpet" on sympathy.

was found to be pleased without my sutures. (Gomez, France Rebus, when fol. 218.) Richelieu's was
found to be perforated ideas with little holes. That abbe Richard deduces
a reductionism from this, which may startle and the good even more
than the facts.

DOWN THE OISE:  CHURCH INTERIORS

We made our first stage below Compiegne to Pont Sainte Maxence.  I was abroad a little after
six the next morning.  The air was biting, and smelt of frost.  In an open place a score of
women wrangled together over the day's market; and the noise of their negotiation sounded thin
and querulous like that of sparrows on a winter's morning.  The rare passengers blew into their
hands, and shuffled in their wooden shoes to set the blood agog.  The streets were full of
icy shadow, although the chimneys were smoking overhead in golden sunshine.  If you wake early
enough at this season of the year, you may get up in December to break your fast in June.
