CHAPTER XIV.

The entertainment which Verus was giving on the eve of his birthday seemed to be far from drawing
to an end, even at the beginning of the third hour of the morning.  Besides the illustrious
and learned Romans who had accompanied the Emperor to Alexandria, the most famous and distinguished
Alexandrians had also been invited by the praetor.  The splendid banquet had long been ended,
but jar after jar of mixed wine was still being filled and emptied.  Verus himself had been
unanimously chosen as the king and leader of the feast. The s. The old, Joke-situated Asuncion. Arrival

The wine offered in libations to the gods already lay in broad pools upon the hard pavement
of the hall, the music and singing were drowned in shouts  the feast had become an orgy.

Verus was inciting the more quiet or slothful of his guests to a freer enjoyment and encouraging
the noisiest in their extravagant recklessness to still more unbridled license.  At the same
time he bowed to each one who drank to his health, entertained the singer who sat by his side,
flung a sparkling jest into one and another silent group, and proved to the learned men who
reclined on their couches near to his that whenever it was possible he took an interest in
their discussions.  Alexandria, the focus of all the learning of the East and the West, had
seen other festivals than this riotous banquet.  Indeed, even here a vein of grave and wise
discourse flavored the meal of the circle that belonged to the Museum; but the senseless revelry
of Rome had found its way into the houses of the rich, and even the noblest achievements of
the human mind had been made, unawares, subservient to mere enjoyment.  A man was a philosopher
only that he might be prompt to discuss and always ready to take his share in the talk; and
at a banquet a well-told anecdote was more heartily welcome than some profound idea that gave
rise to a reflection or provoked a subtle discussion.

What a noise, what a clatter was storming in the hall by the second hour after midnight!  How
the lungs of the feasters were choked with overpowering perfumes!  What repulsive exhibitions
met the eye!  How shamelessly was all decency trodden under foot!  The poisonous breath of
unchecked license had blasted the noble moderation of the vapor of wine which floated round
this chaos of riotous topers slowly rose the pale image of Satiety watching for victims on
the morrow.

The circle of couches on which lay Florus, Favorinus and their Alexandrian friends stood like
an island in the midst of the surging sea of the orgy.  Even here the cup had been bravely
passed round, and Florus was beginning to speak somewhat indistinctly, but conversation had
hitherto had the upper hand.

Two days before, the Emperor had visited the Museum and had carried on learned discussions
with the most prominent of the sages and professors there, in the presence of their assembled
disciples.  At last a formal disputation had arisen, and the dialectic keenness and precision
with which Hadrian, in the purest Attic Greek, had succeeded in driving his opponents into
a corner had excited the greatest admiration.  The Sovereign had quitted the famous institution
with a promise to reopen the contest at an early date.  The philosophers, Pancrates and Dionysius
and Apollonius, who took no wine at all, were giving a detailed account of the different phases
of this remarkable disputation and praising the admirable memory and the ready tongue of the
great monarch.

"And you did not even see him at his best," exclaimed Favorinus, the Gaul, the sophist and
rhetorician.  "He has received an unfavorable oracle and the stars seem to confirm the prophecy.
This puts him out of tune.  Between ourselves let me tell you I know a few who are his superiors
in dialectic, but in his happiest moments he is irresistible- irresistible.  Since we made
up our quarrel he is like a brother to me. I will defend him against all comers, for, as I
say, Hadrian is my brother."

The Gaul had poured out this speech in a defiant tone and with flashing eyes.  He grew pale
in his cups, touchy, boastful and very talkative.

"No doubt you are right," replied Apollonius, "but it seemed to us that he was bitter in discussion.
His eyes are gloomy rather than gay."

"He is my brother," repeated Favorinus, "and as for his eyes, I have seen them flash--by Hercules!
like the radiant sun, or merry twinkling stars! And his mouth!  I know him well!  He is my
brother, and I will wager that while he condescended--it is too comical--condescended to dispute
with you--with you, there was a sly smile at each corner of his mouth--so-- look now--like
this he smiled."

"I repeat, he seemed to us gloomy rather than gay," retorted Apollonius, with annoyance; and
Pancrates added:

"If he does really know how to jest he certainly did not prove it to us."

"Not out of ill-will," laughed the Gaul, "you do not know him, but I--I am his friend and may
follow wherever--he goes.  Now only wait and I will tell you a few stories about him.  If I
chose I could describe his whole soul to you as if it lay there on the surface of the wine
in my cup. Once in Rome he went to inspect the newly-decorated baths of Agrippa, and in the
undressing-room he saw an old man, a veteran who had fought with him somewhere or other.  My
memory is greatly admired, but his is in no respect inferior.  Scaurus was the old man's name--yes--yes,
Scaurus. He did not observe Caesar at first, for after his bath his wounds were burning and
he was rubbing his back against the rough stone of a pillar. Hadrian however called to him:
'Why are you scratching yourself, my friend?' and Scaurus, not at once recognizing Caesar's
voice, answered without turning round:  'Because I have no slave to do it for me.'  You should
have heard Caesar laugh!  Liberal as he is sometimes--I say sometimes--he gave Scaurus a handsome
sum of money and two sturdy slaves. The story soon got abroad, and when Caesar, who--as you
believe--cannot jest, a short time after again visited the bath, two old soldiers at once placed
themselves in his way, scrubbed their backs against the wall like Scaurus, and called out to
him 'Great Caesar, we have no slaves.'--'Then scratch each other,' cried he, and left the soldiers
to rub themselves."

"Capital!" laughed Dionysius. "Now one more true story," interrupted the loquacious Gaul. A FOX

She heard him say that his mouth was quite parched and his throat was longing for a draught
of some drink, and she--who usually had every pin she needed handed to her by a slave, and
on whom fate had bestowed no living creature whom she could find a pleasure in serving--she,
with her own hand dipped a cup of water out of the large clay jar that stood in a corner of
the room and offered it to him with a request that he would drink it.  He eagerly swallowed
the refreshing fluid, and when the little cup was empty Balbilla took it from his hand, refilled
it, and gave it him again.

Claudia, who woke up when the architect came in, looked on at her foster- child's unheard-of
proceedings with astonishment, shaking her head.  When Pontius had drained the third cupful
that Balbilla fetched for him he exclaimed, drawing a deep breath:

"That was a drink--I never tasted a better in the whole course of my life."

"Muddy water out of a nasty earthen pitcher!"  answered the girl.

"And it tasted better than wine from Byblos out of a golden goblet."

"You had honestly earned the refreshment, and thirst gives flavor to the humblest liquor."

"You forget the hand that gave it me," replied the architect warmly.

Balbilla colored and looked at the floor in confusion, but presently raised her face and said,
as gayly and carelessly as ever:

"So that you have been deliciously refreshed; and now that is done you will go home and the
poor thirsty soul will once more become the great architect.  But before that happens, pray
inform us what god it was that brought you hither from Pelusium in the very nick of time when
the fire broke out, and how matters look now in the palace at Lochias?"

"My time is short," replied Pontius, and he then rapidly told her that, after he had finished
his work at Pelusium, he had returned to Alexandria with the imperial post.  As he got out
of the chariot at the post-house he observed the reflection of fire over the sea and was immediately
after told by a slave that it was the palace that was burning.  There were horses in plenty
at the post-house; he had chosen a strong one and had got to the spot before the crowd had
collected.  How the fire had originated, so far remained undiscovered.  "Caesar," he said,
"was in the act of observing the heavens when a flame broke out in a store-shed close to the
tower.  Antinous was the first to detect it, cried 'Fire,' and warned his master.  I found
Hadrian in the greatest agitation; he charged me to superintend the work of rescuing all that
could be saved.  At Lochias.  Verus helped me greatly and indeed with so much boldness and

Three horses had he tired out and replaced by fresh ones, but his sinewy frame and healthy
courage had till now defied every strain.  As soon as he could consider his task at an end
he went off to his own house, and he needed rest; but in the hall of his residence he already
found a number of persons waiting, and who were likely to stand between him and the enjoyment
of it.

A man who lives in the midst of important undertakings cannot, with impunity, leave his work
to take care of itself for several days.  All the claims upon him become pent up, and when
he returns home they deluge him like water when the sluice-gates are suddenly opened behind
which it has been dammed up.

At least twenty persons, who had heard of the architect's return, were waiting for him in his
outer hall, and crowded upon him as soon as he appeared.  Among them he saw several who had
come on important business, but he felt that he had reached the farthest limit of his strength,
and he was determined to secure a little rest at any cost.  The grave man's natural consideration,
usually so conspicuous, could not hold out against the demands made on his endurance, and he
angrily and peevishly pointed to his begrimed face as he made his way through the people waiting
for him.

"To-morrow, to-morrow," he cried; "nay, if necessary, to-day, after sunset.  But now I need
rest.  Rest!  Rest!  Why, you yourselves can see the state I am in."

All--even the master-masons and purveyors who had come on urgent affairs, drew back; only one
elderly man, his sister Paulina's house-steward, caught hold of his chiton, stained as it was
with smoke and scorched in many places, and said quickly and in a low tone:

"My mistress greets you; she has things to speak of to you which will bear no delay; I am not
to leave you till you have promised to go to see her to-day.  Our chariot waits for you at
the garden-door."

"Send it home," said Pontius, not even civilly; "Paulina must wait a few hours."

"But my orders are to take you with me at once."

"But in this state--so--I cannot go with you," cried the architect with vehemence.  "Have you
no sort of consideration?  And yet--who can tell-- well, tell her I will be with her in two hours."

When Pontius had fairly escaped the throng he took a bath; then he had some food brought to
him, but even while he ate and drank, he was not unoccupied, for he read the letters which
awaited him, and examined some drawings which his assistants had prepared during his absence.

"Give yourself an hour's respite," said the old housekeeper, who had been his nurse and who
loved him as her own son.

"I must go to my sister," he answered with a shrug. He who does not conform to Ver, consequently
pays an adps of his yore.” Gods in days of noise preferred choice of more Trees as they wished
to be under their evil. 10. [send iii. 35: to a voice)--”. The Ver and” chirping.. suggests that” Fable

The way from the architect's house to his sister's was long, and on his way he found ample
time for reflection on various matters besides Leukippe's advice to marry.  Still, it was a
woman's face and form that possessed him heart and soul; at first, however, he did not feel
inclined to feast his fancy on Balbilla's image, lovely as it appeared to him; on the contrary,
with self-inflicted severity he sought everything in her which could be thought to be opposed
to the highest standard of feminine perfections.  Nor did he find it difficult to detect many
defects and deficiencies in the Roman damsel; still he was forced to admit that they were quite
inseparable from her character, and that she would no longer be what she was, if she were wholly
free from them.  Each of her little weaknesses presently began to appear as an additional charm
to the stern man who had himself been brought up in the doctrine of the Stoics.

He had learnt by experience that sorrow must cast its shadow over the existence of every human
being; but still, the man to whom it should be vouchsafed to walk through life hand-in-hand

to but pure sunshine. 3. It has been suggested by Brotier and Desbillons, that in this Fable Phædrus

  There was plenty to be seen, for it led to the Hippodrome and was never empty
of foot-passengers and chariots that were proceeding thither or to Necropolis.  No doubt it
was a pleasure to her to watch the fine horses and garlanded youths and men who passed by Paulina's
house; but it was not merely to amuse herself that she went to the bowery little opening; no,
she hoped, on the contrary, that she might once see her Pollux, his father, his mother, his
bother Teuker or some one else they knew pass by her new home.  Then she might perhaps succeed
in calling them, in asking what had become of her friends, and in begging them to let her lover
know where to seek her.

Her adoptive mother had twice found her at the window and had forbidden her, not unkindly but
very positively, to look out into the street. Arsinoe had followed her unresistingly into the
interior of the house, but as soon as she knew that Paulina was out or engaged, she slipped
back to the window again and looked out for him, who must at every hour of the day be thinking
of her.  And she was not happy amid her new and wealthy surroundings.  At first she had found
it very pleasant to stretch her limbs on Paulina's soft cushions, not to stir a finger to help
herself, to eat the best of food and to have neither to attend to the children nor to labor
in the horrible papyrus-factory; but by the third day she pined for liberty--and still more
for the children, for Selene and Pollux. Once she went out driving with Paulina in a covered
carriage for the first time in her life.  As the horses started she had enjoyed the rapid movement
and had leaned out at one side to see the houses and men flying past her; but Paulina had regarded
this as not correct--as she did so many other things that she herself thought right and permissible--had
desired her to draw in her head, and had told her that a well-conducted girl must sit with
her eyes in her lap when out driving.

As soon as they show any disposition to refuse to the old gods the respect that is due to them,
or to raise a finger against them, severity must be exercised and every excess must be punished
by death."

During this conversation Verus had entered the room; he was following the Emperor everywhere
to-day for he hoped to hear him say a word as to his observation of the heavens, and yet he
did not dare to ask him what he had discovered from them.

When he saw that Hadrian was occupied he made a chamberlain conduct him to Antinous.  The favorite
turned pale as he saw the praetor, still he retained enough presence of mind to wish him all
happiness on his birthday.  It did not escape Verus that his presence had startled the lad;
he therefore plied him at first with indifferent questions, introduced pleasing anecdotes into
his conversation and then, when he had gained his purpose, he added carelessly:

"I must thank you in the name of the state and of every friend of Caesar's.  You carried out
your undertaking well to the end, though by somewhat overpowering means."

"I entreat you say no more," interrupted Antinous eagerly, and looking anxiously at the door
of the next room.

"Oh!  I would have sacrificed all Alexandria to preserve Caesar's mind from gloom and care.
Besides we have both paid dearly for our good intentions and for those wretched sheds."

"Pray talk of something else."

"You sit there with your hands bound up and your hair singed, and I feel very unwell."

"Hadrian said you had helped valiantly in the rescue."

"I was sorry for the poor rats whose gathered store of provisions the flames were so rapidly
devouring, and all hot as I was from my supper, I flung myself in among the men who were extinguishing
the fire.  My first reward was a bath of cold, icy-cold sea-water, which was poured over my
head out of a full skin.  All doctrines of ethics are in disgrace with me, and I have long
considered all the dramatic poets, in whose pieces virtue is rewarded and crime punished, as
a pack of fools; for my pleasantest hours are all due to my worst deeds; and sheer annoyance
and misery, to my best.  No hyena can laugh more hoarsely that I now speak; some portion of
me inside here, seems to have been turned into a hedgehog whose spines prick and hurt me, and
all this because I allowed myself to be led away into doing things which the moralists laud
as virtuous."

"You cough, and you do not look well.  He down awhile."

"On my birthday?  No, my young friend.  And now let me just ask you before I go:  Can you tell
me what Hadrian read in the stars?"

"No."

"Not even if I put my Perseus at your orders for every thing you may require of him?  The man
knows Alexandria and is as dumb as a fish."

"Not even then, for what I do not know I cannot tell.  We are both of us ill, and I tell you
once more you will be wise to take care of yourself." Verus left the room, and Antinous watched
him go with much relief.

The praetor's visit had filled him with disquietude, and had added to the dislike he felt for
him.  He knew that he had been used to base ends by Verus, for Hadrian had told him so much
as that he had gone up to the observatory not to question the stars for himself but to cast
the praetor's horoscope, and that he had informed Verus of his intention.

There was no excuse, no forgiveness possible for the deed he had done; to please that dissolute
coxcomb, that mocking hypocrite, he had become a traitor to his master and an incendiary, and
must endure to be overwhelmed with praises and thanks by the greatest and most keen-sighted
of men.  He hated, he abhorred himself, and asked himself why the fire which had blazed around
him had been satisfied only to inflict slight injuries on his hands and hair.  When Hadrian
returned to him he asked his permission to go to bed.  The Emperor gladly granted it, ordered
Mastor to watch by his side, and then agreed to his wife's request that he would visit her.

Sabina had not been to the scene of the fire, but she had sent a messenger every hour to inquire
as to the progress of the conflagration and the well-being of her husband.  When he had first
arrived at the Caesareum she had met and welcomed him and then had retired to her own apartments.

It wanted only two hours of midnight when Hadrian entered her room; he found her reclining
on a couch without the jewels she usually wore in the daytime but dressed as for a banquet.

"You wished to speak with me?"  said the Emperor.  "Yes, and this day-- so full of remarkable
events as it has been--has also a remarkable close since I have not wished in vain."

"You so rarely give me the opportunity of gratifying a wish."

"And do you complain of that?"

"I might--for instead of wishing you are wont to demand."

"Let us cease this strife of idle words."

"Willingly.  With what object did you send for me?"

"Verus is to-day keeping his birthday."

"And you would like to know what the stars promise him?"

"Rather how the signs in the heavens have disposed you towards him."

"I had but little time to consider what I saw.  But at any rate the stars promise him a brilliant
future."

A gleam of joy shone in Sabina's eyes, but she forced herself to keep calm and asked, indifferently:

"You admit that, and yet you can come to no decision?"

"Then you want to hear the decisive word spoken at once, to-day?"

"You know that without my answering you."

"Well, then, his star outshines mine and compels me to be on my guard against him."

"How mean!  You are afraid of the praetor?"

"No, but of his fortune which is bound up with you?"

"When he is our son his greatness will be ours."

"By no means, since if I make him what you wish him to be, he will certainly try to make our
greatness his.  Destiny--"

"You said it favored him; but unfortunately I must dispute the statement."

"You?  Do you try too, to read the stars?"

"No, I leave that to men.  Have you heard of Ammonius, the astrologer?"

"Yes.  A very learned man who observes from the tower of the Serapeum, and who, like many of
his fellows in this city has made use of his art to accumulate a large fortune."

"No less a man than the astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus referred me to him."

"The best of recommendation."

"Well, then, I commissioned Ammonius to cast the horoscope for Verus during the past night
and he brought it to me with an explanatory key. Here it is."

The Emperor hastily seized the tablet which Sabina held out to him, and as he attentively examined
the forecasts, arranged in order according to the hours, he said:

"Quite right.  That of course did not escape me!  Well done, exactly the same as my own observations--but
here--stay--here comes the third hour, at the beginning of which I was interrupted.  Eternal
gods! what have we here?"

The Emperor held the wax tablet prepared by Aminonius at arm's length from his eyes and never
parted his lips again till he had come to the end of the last hour of the night.  Then he dropped
the hand that held the horoscope, saying with a shudder:

"A hideous destiny.  Horace was right in saying the highest towers fall with the greatest crash."

"The tower of which you speak," said Sabina, "is that darling of fortune of whom you are afraid.
Vouchsafe then to Verus a brief space of happiness before the horrible end you foresee for him."

While she spoke Hadrian sat with his eyes thoughtfully fixed on the ground, and then, standing
in front of his wife, he replied:

"If no sinister catastrophe falls upon this man, the stars and the fate of men have no more
to do with one another than the sea with the heart of the desert, than the throb of men's pulses
with the pebbles in the brook. If Ammonius has erred ten times over still more than ten signs
remain on this tablet, hostile and fatal to the praetor.  I grieve for Verus--but the state
suffers with the sovereign's misfortunes.--This man can never be my successor."

"No?" asked Sabina rising from her couch.  "No?  Not when you have seen that your own star
outlives his?  Not though a glance at this tablet shows you that when he is nothing but ashes
the world will still continue long to obey your nod?"

"Compose yourself and give me time.--Yes, I still say not even so."

"Not even so," repeated Sabina sullenly.  Then, collecting herself, she asked in a tone of
vehement entreaty:

"Not even so--not even if I lift my hands to you in supplication and cry in your face that
you and Fate have grudged me the blessing, the happiness, the crown and aim of a woman's life,
and I must and I will attain it; I must and I will once, if only for a short time, hear myself
called by some dear lips by the name which gives the veriest beggar-woman with her infant in
her arms preeminence above the Empress who has never stood by a child's cradle.  I must and
I will, before I die, be a mother, be called mother and be able to say, 'my child, my son--our
son.'"  And as she spoke she sobbed aloud and covered her face with her hands.

The Emperor drew back a step from his wife.  A miracle had been wrought before his eyes.  Sabina--in
whose eyes no tear had ever been seen-- Sabina was weeping, Sabina had a heart like other women.
Greatly astonished and deeply moved he saw her turn from him, utterly shaken by the agitation
of her feelings, and sink on her knees by the side of the couch she had quitted to hide her
face in the cushions.  He stood motionless by her side, but presently going nearer to her:

"Stand up, Sabina," he said.  "Your desire is a just one.  You shall have the son for whom
your soul longs."

The Empress rose and a grateful look in her eyes, swimming in tears, met his glance.  Sabina
could smile too, she could look sweet!  It had taken a lifetime, it had needed such a moment
as this to reveal it to Hadrian.

He silently drew a seat towards her and sat down by her side; for some time he sat with her
hand clasped in his, in silence.  Then he let it go and said kindly:

"And will Verus fulfil all you expect of a son?"  She nodded assent.

"What makes you so confident of that?"  asked the Emperor.  "He is a Roman and not lacking
in brilliant and estimable gifts.  A man who shows such mettle alike in the field and in the
council-chamber and yet can play the part of Eros with such success will also know how to wear
the purple without disgracing it.  But he has his mother's light blood, and his heart flutters
hither and thither."

"Let him be as he is.  We understand each other and he is the only man on whose disposition
I can build, on whose fidelity I can count as securely as if he were my favorite son."

"And on what facts is this confidence based?"

"You will understand me, for you are not blind to the signs which Fate vouchsafes to us.  Have
you time to listen to a short story?"

"The night is yet young."

"Then I will tell you.  Forgive me if I begin with things that seem dead and gone; but they
are not, for they live and work in me to this hour.  I know that you yourself did not choose
me for your wife.  Plotina chose me for you--she loved you, whether your regard for her was
for the beautiful woman or for the wife of Caesar to whom everything belonged that you had
to look for--how should I know?"

"It was Plotina, the woman, that I honored and loved--"

"In choosing me she chose you a wife who was tall and so fitted to wear the purple, but who
was never beautiful.  She knew me well and she knew that I was less apt than any other woman
to win hearts; in my parents' house no child ever enjoyed so slender a share of the gifts of
love, and none can know better than you that my husband did not spoil me with tenderness."

"I could repent of it at this moment."

"It would be too late now.  But I will not be bitter--no, indeed I will not.  And yet if you
are to understand me I must own that so long as I was young I longed bitterly for the love
which no one offered me."

"And you yourself have never loved?"

"No--but it pained me that I could not.  In Plotina's apartments I often saw the children of
her relations, and many a time I tried to attract them to me, but while they would play confidently
with other women they seemed to shun me.  Soon I even grew cross to them--only our Verus, the
little son of Celonius Commodus, would give me frank answers when I spoke to him, and would
bring me his broken toys that I might mend their injuries.  And so I got to love the child."

"He was a wonderfully sweet, attractive boy."

"He was indeed.  One day we women were all sitting together in Caesar's garden.  Verus came
running out with a particularly fine apple that Trajan himself had given him.  The rosy-cheeked
fruit was admired by every one.  Then Plotina, in fun took the apple out of the boy's hand
and asked him if he would not give his apple to her.  He looked at her with wide-open puzzled
eyes, shook his curly head, ran up to me and gave me-- yes, me, and no one else--the fruit,
throwing his arms round my neck and saying, 'Sabina you shall have it.'"

"The judgment of Paris."

"Nay, do not jest now.  This action of an unselfish child gave me courage to endure the troubles
of life.  I knew now that there was one creature that loved me, and that one repaid all that
I felt for him, all that I was never weary of doing for him with affectionate liking.  He is
the only being, of whom I know, that will weep when I die.  Give him the right to call me his
mother and make him our son."

"He is our son," said Hadrian, with dignified gravity, and held out his hand to Sabina.  She
tried to lift it to her lips but he drew it away and went on:

"Inform him that we accept him as our son.  His wife is the daughter of Nigrinus--who had to
go, as I desired to stay and stand firm.  You do not love Lucilla, but we must both admire
her for I do not know another woman in Rome whose virtue a man might vouch for.  Besides, I
owe her a father, and am glad to have such a daughter; thus we shall be blessed with children.
Whether I shall appoint Verus my successor and proclaim to the world who shall be its future
ruler I cannot now decide; for that I need a calmer hour.  Till to-morrow, Sabina.  This day
began with a misfortune; may the deed with which we have combined to end it prosper and bring
us happiness."

CHAPTER XVII.

There are often fine warm days in February, but those who fancy the spring has come find themselves
deceived.  The bitter, hard Sabina could at times let soft and tender emotions get the mastery
over her, but as soon as the longing of her languishing soul for maternal happiness was gratified,
she closed her heart again and extinguished the fire that had warmed it.  Every one who approached
her, even her husband, felt himself chilled and repelled again by her manner.

Arsinoe was only allowed to see her sister rarely and always accompanied by her protectress,
and she and Selene never were able to have any unchecked and open conversation.  The steward's
eldest daughter was now contented and cheerful, while the younger was not only saddened by
the disappearance of her lover, but also, from being unhappy in her new home, she had become
fractious and easily moved to shed tears.  All was well with the younger orphans; they were
often taken to see Selene, and spoke with affection of their new parents.

As she got well her help diminished the strain on her two friends, and in the beginning of
March a call came to the widow which, if she followed it, must give their simple existence
a new aspect.

In Upper Egypt certain Christian fraternities had been established, and one of these had addressed
a prayer to the great mother-community at Alexandria, that it would send to them a presbyter,
a deacon and a deaconess capable of organizing and guiding the believers and catechumens in
the province of Hermopolis where they were already numbered by thousands.  The life of the
community and the care of the poor, and sick in the outlying districts required organization
by experienced hands, and Hannah had been asked whether she could make up her mind to leave
the metropolis and carry on the work of benevolence at Besa in an extended sphere.

She would there have a pleasant house, a palm-garden, and gifts from the congregation which
would secure not merely her own maintenance, but that of her adopted children.

Hannah was bound to Alexandria by many ties; in the first place she clung to the poor and sick,
many of whom had grown very dear to her, and how many girls who had gone astray had she rescued
from evil in the factory alone!  She begged for a short time for reflection, and this was granted
to her.  By the fifteenth of March she was to decide, but by the fifth she had already made
up her mind, for while Hannah was in the papyrus- factory Antinous had succeeded in getting
into Paulina's garden shortly before sunset and in stealing close up to Hannah's house.  Mary
again observed him as he approached and signed to him to go, in her usual pleasant way; but
the Bithynian was more excited than usual; he seized her hand and clasped her with urgent warmth
as he implored her to be merciful.  She endeavored at once to free herself, but he would not
let her go, but cried in coaxing tones:

"I must see her and speak to her to-day, dear, good Mary, only this once!"  And before she
could prevent it he had kissed her forehead and had flown into the house to Selene.  The little
hunchback did not know what had happened to her; confused and almost paralyzed by conflicting
feelings she stood shame-faced, gazing at the ground.  She felt that something quite extraordinary
had happened to her, but this wonderful something radiated a dazzling splendor, and since this
had risen for her, for poor Mary, a feeling of pride quite new to her mingled with the shame
and indignation that filled her soul.  She needed a few minutes to collect herself and to recover
a sense of her duty, and those few minutes were made good use of by Antinous.

He flew with long steps into the room in which, on that never-to-be- forgotten night, he had
laid Selene on the couch, and even at the threshold he called her by her name.  She started
and laid aside the book out of which she was reading to her blind brother.  He called a second
time, beseechingly. The train, furthermore, has two platform-cars bind to it, which are
