On the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert--forty memorable miles of bottomless
sand, into which the coach wheels sunk from six inches to a foot.  We worked our passage most
of the way across. That is to say, we got out and walked.  It was a dreary pull and a long

road was white with the bones of oxen and horses. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say
that we could have walked the forty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step!  The desert
was one prodigious graveyard.  And the log-chains, wagon tyres, and rotting wrecks of vehicles
were almost as thick as the bones.  I think we saw log-chains enough rusting there in the desert,
