 He had already walled in the apse of the King where the three chapels are, and carried
out the three upper windows. But it was not known what he meant to do with the vault. They
then, misled by their shallow judgment, made Cardinal Salviati the elder, and Marcello Cervini,
who was afterwards Pope, believe that S. Peter's would be badly lighted. When all were assembled,
the Pope told Michelangelo that the deputies were of opinion the apse would have but little
light. He answered: 'I should like to hear these deputies speak.' The Cardinal Marcello rejoined:
'Here we are.' Michelangelo then remarked: 'My lord, above these three windows there will be
other three in the vault, which is to be built of travertine.' 'You never told us anything
about this,' said the Cardinal. Michelangelo responded: 'I am not, nor do I mean to be obliged
to tell your lordship or anybody what I ought or wish to do. It is your business to provide
money, and to see that it is not stolen. As regards the plans of the building, you have to
leave those to me.' Then he turned to the Pope and said: 'Holy Father, behold what gains are
mine! Unless the hardships I endure prove beneficial to my soul, I am losing time and labour.'
The Pope, who loved him, laid his hands upon his shoulders and exclaimed: 'You are gaining
both for soul and body, have no fear!' Michelangelo's spirited self-defence increased the Pope's
love, and he ordered him to repair next day with Vasari to the Vigna Giulia, where they held
long discourses upon art." It is here that Vasari relates how Julius III. was in the habit
of seating Michelangelo by his side while they talked together.

Julius then maintained the cause of Michelangelo against the deputies. It was during his pontificate
that a piece of engineering work committed to Buonarroti's charge by Paul III. fell into the
hands of Nanni di Baccio Bigio. The old bridge of Santa Maria had long shown signs of giving
way, and materials had been collected for rebuilding it. Nanni's friends managed to transfer
the execution of this work to him from Michelangelo. The man laid bad foundations, and Buonarroti
riding over the new bridge one day with Vasari, cried out: "George, the bridge is quivering
beneath us; let us spur on, before it gives way with us upon it." Eventually, the bridge did
fall to pieces, at the time of a great inundation. Its ruins have long been known as the Ponte
Rotto.

On the death of Julius III. in 1555, Cardinal Cervini was made Pope, with the title of Marcellus
II. This event revived the hopes of the sect, who once more began to machinate against Michelangelo.
The Duke of Tuscany at this time was exceedingly anxious that he should take up his final abode
at Florence; and Buonarroti, feeling he had now no strong support in Rome, seems to have entertained
these proposals with alacrity. The death of Marcellus after a few weeks, and the election of
Paul IV., who besought the great architect not to desert S. Peter's, made him change his mind.
Several letters written to Vasari and the Grand Duke in this and the next two years show that
his heart was set on finishing S. Peter's, however much he wished to please his friends and
longed to end his days in peace at home. "I was set to work upon S. Peter's against my will,
and I have served now eight years gratis, and with the utmost injury and discomfort to myself. To-narrative

He also observed that the work had just reached its most critical stage (i.e., the erection
of the cupola), and that to desert it at the present moment would be a great disgrace.

The vaulting of the cupola had now indeed become the main preoccupation of Michelangelo's life.
Early in 1557 a serious illness threatened his health, and several friends, including the Cardinal
of Carpi, Donato Giannotti, Tommaso Cavalieri, Francesco Bandini, and Lottino, persuaded him
that he ought to construct a large model, so that the execution of this most important feature
of the edifice might not be impeded in the event of his death. It appears certain that up to
this date no models of his on anything like a large intelligible scale had been provided for
S. Peter's; and the only extant model attributable to Michelangelo's own period is that of
the cupola. This may help to account for the fact that, while the cupola was finished much
as he intended, the rest of his scheme suffered a thorough and injurious remodelling.

He wrote to his nephew Lionardo on the 13th of February 1557 about the impossibility of meeting
the Grand Duke's wishes and leaving Rome. "I told his Lordship that I was obliged to attend
to S. Peter's until I could leave the work there at such a point that my plans would not be
subsequently altered. This point has not been reached; and in addition, I am now obliged to
construct a large wooden model for the cupola and lantern, in order that I may secure its being
finished as it was meant to be. The whole of Rome, and especially the Cardinal of Carpi, puts
great pressure on me to do this. Accordingly, I reckon that I shall have to remain here not
less than a year; and so much time I beg the Duke to allow me for the love of Christ and S.
Peter, so that I may not come home to Florence with a pricking conscience, but a mind easy
about Rome." The model took about a year to make. It was executed by a French master named Jean.
