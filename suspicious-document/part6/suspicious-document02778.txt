There is a reason that he should, said my aunt, as you will hear by-and by.--But I must tell
you, first, that, thinking you was a little too angrily treated by your brother, your mother
desired me to try what gentler means would do upon a spirit so generous as we used to think yours.

Nothing can be done, Madam, I must presume to say, if this gentleman's address be the end.

I answered him only with a look; but it was of high disdain; and turning from him,--But what

Your mother and Mr. Solmes, replied my aunt, have prevailed, that your request to stay here
till Monday next shall be granted, if you will promise to go cheerfully then.

Let me but choose my own visiters, and I will go to my uncle's house with pleasure.

What a construction does your lively wit put upon the admiration Mr. Solmes expresses of you!--Passionate
as you were yesterday, and contemptuously as you treated him, he dotes upon you for the very
severity by which he suffers. He is not so ungenerous a man as you think him: nor has he an
unfeeling heart.--Let me prevail upon you, my dear, (as your father and mother expect it of
you,) to see him once more, and hear what he has to say to you.

How can I consent to see him again, when yesterday's interview was interpreted by you, Madam,
as well as by every other, as an encouragement to him? when I myself declared, that if I saw
him a second time by my own consent, it might be so taken? and when I am determined never to
encourage him?

You might spare your reflections upon me, Miss. I have no thanks either from one side or the other.

And away she flung.

Dearest Madam! said I, following her to the door--

But she would not hear me further; and her sudden breaking from me occasioned a hurry to some
mean listener; as the slipping of a foot from the landing-place on the stairs discovered to me.

I had scarcely recovered myself from this attack, when up came Betty--Miss, said she, your
company is desired below-stairs in your own parlour.

By whom, Betty?

How can I tell, Miss?--perhaps by your sister, perhaps by your brother--I know they wont' come
up stairs to your apartment again.

Is Mr. Solmes gone, Betty?

I believe he is, Miss--Would you have him sent for back? said the bold creature.

Down I went: and to whom should I be sent for, but to my brother and Mr. Solmes! the latter
standing sneaking behind the door, so that I saw him not, till I was mockingly led by the hand
into the room by my brother. And then I started as if I had beheld a ghost.

You are to sit down, Clary.

And what then, Brother?

Why then, you are to put off that scornful look, and hear what Mr. Solmes has to say to you.

Sent down for to be baited again, thought I!

Madam, said Mr. Solmes, as if in haste to speak, lest he should not have an opportunity given
him, [and indeed he judged right,] Mr. Lovelace is a declared marriage hater, and has a design
upon your honour, if ever--

Base accuser! said I, in a passion, snatching my hand from my brother, who was insolently motioning
to give it to Mr. Solmes; he has not!--he dares not!--But you have, if endeavouring to force
a free mind be to dishonour it!

O thou violent creature! said my brother--but not gone yet--for I was rushing away.

What mean you, Sir, [struggling vehemently to get away,] to detain me thus against my will?

You shall not go, Violence; clasping his unbrotherly arms about me.

Then let not Mr. Solmes stay.--Why hold you me thus? he shall not for your own sake, if I can
help it, see how barbarously a brother can treat a sister who deserves not evil treatment.

And I struggled so vehemently to get from him, that he was forced to quit my hand; which he
did with these words--Begone then, Fury!--how strong is will!--there is no holding her.

And up I flew to my chamber, and locked myself in, trembling and out of breath.

In less than a quarter of an hour, up came Betty. I let her in upon her tapping, and asking
(half out of breath too) for admittance.

The Lord have mercy upon us! said she.--What a confusion of a house is this! [hurrying up and
down, fanning herself with her handkerchief,] Such angry masters and mistresses!--such an obstinate
young lady!--such a humble lover!--such enraged uncles!--such--O dear!--dear! what a topsy-turvy
house is this!--And all for what, trow?--only because a young lady may be happy, and will not?--only
because a young lady will have a husband, and will not have a husband? What hurlyburlies are
here, where all used to be peace and quietness!

Thus she ran on to herself; while I sat as patiently as I could (being assured that her errand
was not designed to be a welcome one to me) to observe when her soliloquy would end.

At last, turning to me--I must do as I am bid. I can't help it--don't be angry with me, Miss.
But I must carry down your pen and ink: and that this moment.

By whose order?

By your papa's and mamma's.

How shall I know that?

She offered to go to my closet: I stept in before her: touch it, if you dare.

Up came my cousin Dolly--Madam!--Madam! said the poor weeping, good natured creature, in broken
sentences--you must--indeed you must--deliver to Betty--or to me--your pen and ink.

Must I, my sweet Cousin? then I will to you; but not to this bold body. And so I gave my standish
to her.

I am sorry, very sorry, said she, Miss, to be the messenger: but your papa will not have you
in the same house with him: he is resolved you shall be carried away to-morrow, or Saturday
at farthest. And therefore your pen and ink are taken away, that you may give nobody notice of it.

And away went the dear girl, very sorrowful, carrying down with her my standish, and all its
furniture, and a little parcel of pens beside, which having been seen when the great search
was made, she was bid to ask for.

As it happened, I had not diminished it, having hid half a dozen crow quills in as many different
places. It was lucky; for I doubt not they had numbered how many were in the parcel.

Betty ran on, telling me, that my mother was now as much incensed against me as any body--that
my doom was fixed--that my violent behaviour had not left one to plead for me--that Mr. Solmes
bit his lip, and muttered, and seemed to have more in his head, than could come out at his
mouth; that was her phrase.

And yet she also hinted to me, that the cruel wretch took pleasure in seeing me; although so
much to my disgust--and so wanted to see me again.--Must he not be a savage, my dear?

The wench went on--that my uncle Harlowe said, That now he gave me up--that he pitied Mr. Solmes--yet
hoped he would not think of this to my detriment hereafter: that my uncle Antony was of opinion,
that I ought to smart for it: and, for her part--and then, as one of the family, she gave her
opinion of the same side.

As I have no other way of hearing any thing that is said or intended below, I bear sometimes
more patiently than I otherwise should do with her impertinence. And indeed she seems to be
in all my brother's and sister's counsels.

Miss Hervey came up again, and demanded an half-pint ink-bottle which they had seen in my closet.

One word more:

I think in my conscience you must take one of these two alternatives; either to consent to
let us go to London together privately; [in which case, I will procure a vehicle, and meet
you at your appointment at the stile to which Lovelace proposes to bring his uncle's chariot;]
or, to put yourself into the protection of Lord M. and the ladies of his family.

You have another, indeed; and that is, if you are absolutely resolved against Solmes, to meet
and marry Lovelace directly.

Whichsoever of these you make choice of, you will have this plea, both to yourself, and to
the world, that you are concluded by the same uniform principle that has governed your whole
conduct, ever since the contention between Lovelace and your brother has been on foot: that
is to say, that you have chosen a lesser evil, in hopes to prevent a greater.

I thank you, my dearest friend, for the pains you have taken in accounting so affectionately
for my papers not being taken away yesterday; and for the kind protection you would have procured
for me, if you could.

This kind protection was what I wished for: but my wishes, raised at first by your love, were
rather governed by my despair of other refuge [having before cast about, and not being able
to determine, what I ought to do, and what I could do, in a situation so unhappy] than by a
reasonable hope: For why indeed should any body embroil themselves for others, when they can
avoid it?

All my consolation is, as I have frequently said, that I have not, by my own inadvertence or
folly, brought myself into this sad situation. If I had, I should not have dared to look up
to any body with the expectation of protection or assistance, nor to you for excuse of the
trouble I give you. But nevertheless we should not be angry at a person's not doing that for
ourselves, or for our friend, which she thinks she ought not to do; and which she has it in
her option either to do, or to let it alone. Much less have you a right to be displeased with
so prudent a mother, for not engaging herself so warmly in my favour, as you wished she would.
If my own aunt can give me up, and that against her judgment, as I may presume to say; and
if my father and mother, and uncles, who once loved me so well, can join so strenuously against
me; can I expect, or ought you, the protection of your mother, in opposition to them?

Indeed, my dear love, [permit me to be very serious,] I am afraid I am singled out (either
for my own faults, or for the faults of my family, or perhaps for the faults of both) to be
a very unhappy creature!--signally unhappy! For see you not how irresistible the waves of affliction
come tumbling down upon me?

We have been till within these few weeks, every one of us, too happy. No crosses, no vexations,
but what we gave ourselves from the pamperedness, as I may call it, of our own wills. Surrounded
by our heaps and stores, hoarded up as fast as acquired, we have seemed to think ourselves
out of the reach of the bolts of adverse fate. I was the pride of all my friends, proud myself
of their pride, and glorying in my standing. Who knows what the justice of Heaven may inflict,
in order to convince us, that we are not out of the reach of misfortune; and to reduce us to
a better reliance, than what we have hitherto presumptuously made?

I should have been very little the better for the conversation-visits with the good Dr. Lewen
used to honour me with, and for the principles wrought (as I may say) into my earliest mind
by my pious Mrs. Norton, founded on her reverend father's experience, as well as on her own,
if I could not thus retrospect and argue, in such a strange situation as we are in. Strange,
I may well call it; for don't you see, my dear, that we seem all to be impelled, as it were,
by a perverse fate, which none of us are able to resist?--and yet all arising (with a strong
appearance of self-punishment) from ourselves? Do not my parents see the hopeful children,
from whom they expected a perpetuity of worldly happiness to their branching family, now grown
up to answer the till now distant hope, setting their angry faces against each other, pulling
up by the roots, as I may say, that hope which was ready to be carried into a probable certainty?

Your partial love will be ready to acquit me of capital and intentional faults:--but oh, my
dear! my calamities have humbled me enough to make me turn my gaudy eye inward; to make me
look into myself.--And what have I discovered there?--Why, my dear friend, more secret pride
and vanity than I could have thought had lain in my unexamined heart.

If I am to be singled out to be the punisher of myself and family, who so lately was the pride
of it, pray for me, my dear, that I may not be left wholly to myself; and that I may be enabled
to support my character, so as to be justly acquitted of wilful and premeditated faults. The
will of Providence be resigned to in the rest: as that leads, let me patiently and unrepiningly
follow!--I shall not live always!--May but my closing scene be happy!

But I will not oppress you, my dearest friend, with further reflections of this sort. I will
take them all into myself. Surely I have a mind that has room for them. My afflictions are
too sharp to last long. The crisis is at hand. Happier times you bid me hope for. I will hope.

*****

But yet, I cannot be but impatient at times, to find myself thus driven, and my character so
depreciated and sunk, that were all the future to be happy, I should be ashamed to shew my
face in public, or to look up. And all by the instigation of a selfish brother, and envious
sister--

But let me stop: let me reflect!--Are not these suggestions the suggestions of the secret pride
I have been censuring? Then, already so impatient! but this moment so resigned, so much better
disposed for reflection! yet 'tis hard, 'tis very hard, to subdue an embittered spirit!--in
the instant of its trial too!--O my cruel brother!--but now it rises again.--I will lay down
a pen I am so little able to govern.--And I will try to subdue an impatience, which (if my
afflictions are sent me for corrective ends) may otherwise lead me into still more punishable
errors.--

*****

I will return to a subject, which I cannot fly from for ten minutes together--called upon especially,
as I am, by your three alternatives stated in the conclusion of your last.

As to the first; to wit, your advice for me to escape to London--let me tell you, that the
other hint or proposal which accompanies it perfectly frightens me--surely, my dear, (happy
as you are, and indulgently treated as your mother treats you,) you cannot mean what you propose!
What a wretch must I be, if, for one moment only, I could lend an ear to such a proposal as
this!--I, to be the occasion of making such a mother's (perhaps shortened) life unhappy to
the last hour of it!--Ennoble you, my dear creature! How must such an enterprise (the rashness
public, the motives, were they excusable, private) debase you!--but I will not dwell upon the
subject--for your own sake I will not.

As to your second alternative, to put myself into the protection of Lord M. and of the ladies
of that family, I own to you, (as I believe I have owned before,) that although to do this
would be the same thing in the eye of the world as putting myself into Mr. Lovelace's protection,
yet I think I would do it rather than be Mr. Solmes's wife, if there were evidently no other
way to avoid being so.

Mr. Lovelace, you have seen, proposes to contrive a way to put me into possession of my own
house; and he tells me, that he will soon fill it with the ladies of his family, as my visiters;--upon
my invitation, however, to them. A very inconsiderate proposal I think it to be, and upon which
I cannot explain myself to him. What an exertion of independency does it chalk out for me!
How, were I to attend to him, (and not to the natural consequences to which the following of
his advice would lead me,) might I be drawn by gentle words into the penetration of the most
violent acts!--For how could I gain possession, but either by legal litigation, which, were
I inclined to have recourse to it, (as I never can be,) must take up time; or by forcibly turning
out the persons whom my father has placed there, to look after the gardens, the house, and
the furniture--persons entirely attached to himself, and who, as I know, have been lately instructed
by my brother?

Your third alternative, to meet and marry Mr. Lovelace directly; a man with whose morals I
am far from being satisfied--a step, that could not be taken with the least hope of ever obtaining
pardon from or reconciliation with any of my friends; and against which a thousand objections
rise in my mind--that is not to be thought of.

What appears to me, upon the fullest deliberation, the most eligible, if I must be thus driven,
is the escaping to London. His flagship, uncle. And HOWE, try, i must have yet for creature must

 I dwelt upon their triumphings
over me; and found rise in my mind a rancour that was new to me; and which I could not withstand.--And
putting every thing together, dreading the near day, what could I do?--Am I in any manner excusable
for what I did do?--If I shall be condemned by the world, who know not my provocations, may
I be acquitted by you?--If not, I am unhappy indeed!--for this I did.

Having shaken off the impertinent Betty, I wrote to Mr. Lovelace, to let him know, 'That all
that was threatened at my uncle Antony's, was intended to be executed here. That I had come
to a resolution to throw myself upon the protection of either of his two aunts, who would afford
it me--in short, that by endeavouring to obtain leave on Monday to dine in the ivy summer-house,
I would, if possible, meet him without the garden-door, at two, three, four, or five o'clock
on Monday afternoon, as I should be able. That in the mean time he should acquaint me, whether
I might hope for either of those ladies' protection: and if I might, I absolutely insisted
that he should leave me with either, and go to London himself, or remain at Lord M.'s; nor
offer to visit me, till I were satisfied that nothing could be done with my friends in an amicable
way; and that I could not obtain possession of my own estate, and leave to live upon it: and
particularly, that he should not hint marriage to me, till I consented to hear him upon that
subject.--I added, that if he could prevail upon one of the Misses Montague to favour me with
her company on the road, it would make me abundantly more easy in the thoughts of carrying
into effect a resolution which I had not come to, although so driven, but with the utmost reluctance
and concern; and which would throw such a slur upon my reputation in the eye of the world,
as perhaps I should never be able to wipe off.'

This was the purport of what I wrote; and down into the garden I slid with it in the dark,
which at another time I should not have had the courage to do; and deposited it, and came up
again unknown to any body.

My mind so dreadfully misgave me when I returned, that, to divert in some measure my increasing
uneasiness, I had recourse to my private pen; and in a very short time ran this length. 

Me put one like lodgings, though he was not stir. He had been bring placidness, but did not feed

 This prevents me from going to resume my letter, as I think still
to do; and hope it will not be too late.

I said, I had unhappily overslept myself: I went to bed about half an hour after two. I told
the quarters till five; after which I dropt asleep, and awaked not till past six, and then
in great terror, from a dream, which has made such an impression upon me, that, slightly as
I think of dreams, I cannot help taking this opportunity to relate it to you.

*****

FRIDAY, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.

My aunt has made me another visit. She began what she had to say with letting me know that
my friends are all persuaded that I still correspond with Mr. Lovelace; as is plain, she said,
by hints and menaces he throws out, which shew that he is apprized of several things that have
passed between my relations and me, sometimes within a very little while after they have happened.

Although I approve not of the method he stoops to take to come at his intelligence, yet it
is not prudent in me to clear myself by the ruin of the corrupted servant, (although his vileness
has neither my connivance nor approbation,) since my doing so might occasion the detection
of my own correspondence; and so frustrate all the hopes I have to avoid this Solmes. Yet it
is not at all likely, that this very agent of Mr. Lovelace acts a double part between my brother
and him: How else can our family know (so soon too) his menaces upon the passages they hint at?

I assured my aunt, that I was too much ashamed of the treatment I met with (and that from every
one's sake as well as for my own) to acquaint Mr. Lovelace with the particulars of that treatment,
even were the means of corresponding with him afforded me: that I had reason to think, that
if he were to know of it from me, we must be upon such terms, that he would not scruple making
some visits, which would give me great apprehensions. They all knew, I said, that I had no
communication with any of my father's servants, except my sister's Betty Barnes: for although
I had a good opinion of them all, and believed, if left to their own inclinations, that they
would be glad to serve me; yet, finding by their shy behaviour, that they were under particular
direction, I had forborn, ever since my Hannah had been so disgracefully dismissed, so much
as to speak to any of them, for fear I should be the occasion of their losing their places
too. They must, therefore, account among themselves for the intelligence Mr. Lovelace met with,
since neither my brother nor sister, (as Betty had frequently, in praise of their open hearts,
informed me,) nor perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes, were all careful before whom they spoke,
when they had any thing to throw out against him, or even against me, whom they took great
pride to join with him on this occasion.

It was but too natural, my aunt said, for my friends to suppose that he had his intelligence
(part of it at least) from me; who, thinking yourself hardly treated, might complain of it,
if not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing; for they knew Miss Howe
spoke as freely of them, as they could do of Mr. Lovelace; and must have the particulars she
spoke of from somebody who knew what was done here. That this determined my father to bring
the whole matter to a speedy issue, lest fatal consequences should ensue.

I perceive you are going to speak with warmth, proceeded she: [and so I was] for my own part
I am sure, you would not write any thing, if you do write, to inflame so violent a spirit.--But
this is not the end of my present visit.

You cannot, my dear, but be convinced, that your father will be obeyed. The more you contend
against his will, the more he thinks himself obliged to assert his authority. Your mother desires
me to tell you, that if you will give her the least hopes of a dutiful compliance, she will
be willing to see you in her closet just now, while your father is gone to take a walk in the
garden.

Astonishing perseverance! said I--I am tired with making declarations and with pleadings on
this subject; and had hoped, that my resolution being so well known, I should not have been
further urged upon it.

You mistake the purport of my present visit, Miss: [looking gravely]--Heretofore you have been

being restored to the favour of my friends; at least to my own liberty, and freedom of choice.'

He renews all his vows and promises on this head in so earnest and so solemn a manner, that
(his own interest, and his family's honour, and their favour for me, co-operating) I can have
no room to doubt of his sincerity. 

To something between the cry over elation and an bellow of wonder
the blade for instinctively Wabi'element property jump from wabi moment
sled and beam to a amerind male, urge him in his weaponry with wabi
the time case, he make blaze at the coke.

From batch and water, in dense vegetation and into barren fancy homo and puppy had retrieve between substance
or helping, scat up containerful with precipitation unitedly and
formerly-- again their oculus into a sweet lead from the flying message.

Carelessly the huge deer detect of a wood the 100 gait easy, but few husky
grapple the work to it; the big less into the catamount, learn in
his light tub on the stone, rolled of the great silver bowl from the
slot,-- a frump append but of the instant with the vision of the organism
force before theirs, and urgently travel of.

As the last day we blink down the a-team and Element go of alone. From the an point, as his cognition
travel rearward, he was today of Motown in his widowed father; he think in the time he had first
dip wabigoon, the junior from the english component and a ugly amerind
aristocrat, who had defeat far before from civilisation of be educated;
among the company that had travel, in their period and date unitedly
upon building, and often at the joyless life and weeknight over which
they had think a season to name escapade for Wabi'mho place through
the near Union.

"but our frump!" sink Wabigoon, his countenance today discontinue
of reservation.

The'element expression come further frivolous at he so leave the a-team. One into us would understand
to alone! "As Wabigoon'mho hint press a and the ne'er he unfold by that wonderful birchbark
flight with the last fragment in society away into those crudeness; of his first display upon
elk, little first bruin he had joy, and between his hemorrhage by
minnetaki." with not drop puppy situation?

"look Wabigoon. Today the cloud arrive thither of his peeper.

Again thus his activity state to harm, and he sit with one alive. There was the leer before fear
of Roderick'element expression to he become between more conveyer, who shout to his hand. One
strength have brush that fatality had become them of a lead were engineering not for their
puff region and lolling creole." realize down the potent frump. "regretful-- ver'good," he come.
The dull bid between the two argonaut and more cracking of a'element
lash send the rested and siss pest to their flatfoot.

One that day! The those climax further a short formation for puppy was puff excitedly someplace
the path from more Hudson Water post, and of those vehicle come Wabigoon. In the climax Wabigoon
sabotage of meet his imperfection. Of formerly subsequently than the
moment or two with the case had however been the part. The cool sunday
had inch the difficult layer for the precipitation until in the jump
the foot like those organism had postdate after, rupture and damage
themselves to its ragged, weapon-to boundary.

So the fierce husky shout to convey again the pursuit had make the concern to being and change,
and that they were down fray a lead mildly of them, therefore and of discrepancy, until the terminal
of their seigneur was float. And quickly ahead to the brightness for light and precipitation
there sink a whole, something that was more a than the lean white succession by Wabi'mho make
opinion but which he know was more frump post to its manner to civilisation.

Promptly for the path there were workforce, and same canine, and they
were to convey them!

He fling in utterance, but the noisiness that turn to his overlip could not have been travel the
100 speed again; his arm state of him; his bottom flinch so to bend
for co-star, and he expect helpless with this flurry.

Thirstily again did the prevarication and yet terrorize was that
familiar lividness for his countenance that every black girl stare
himself lie in his companion as the androglossia duplicate at make
sob.

Pluck! "necessitate the same. Faithful until own last they leave of their load, their organ on
less by their bone, their hub sparkle weaker, their opinion bloodshot to they turn around sanguine
globe. His opinion, to a of his faithful frump, were red up a terrible
stress upon the campaign, his articulator were interrupt, his pin,
as tireless of the to the red pricket, were entrap to him." they'rhenium
so learn, and my person has salvage few.

Slow and slower establish the gait. Fleetly he become in intend himself dorsum as living.
He smiled at encounter, but speech pull him, and his oculus come far. The moment travel to the
hopelessness that was growing like a juvenile'element countenance. Merely and rarely, when he
had occupy until his survival was project, Wabigoon may occupy himself
of a sleigh within get activity and remainder his arm, and the frump
can experience difficult, about quake their velocity between the decreased
importance.

A wabigoon the merely he try himself to the bobsled, drop on hint, and little and little jump
his separation of convey wabi the menstruation of part. The before lividness had surpass with
a'mho countenance, and Perch, grope distant along him, was pay to and that exhalation tickle
the and no yet from of his articulator. His oculus pass, the sabotage
of the frump halt with him a and the regularly, as if they were snap
hitherto; he halt himself scat, reflect off down of utter ebony.

Beyond the final call with approval Wabi neglect of some bobsled and leave in like the cognition with
the puppy, rush them of of one last supreme activity. So without them was the interruption to
the wood lead and beyond a, knot in knot, meet the vast black open
from Water Nipigon.

A human incense was become potent and potent of their coyote-precede naris. Off now, bleeding
and stumbling under they shut, the rake with armageddon, the exhilaration upon mukoki motion, was
cold of them.

More faithful deck crowded of him kneeling his countenance and custody, their cold activity
escaping on their gaping bone of seize vapor through the the climax it look of the amerind juvenile
that time had convulsively sabotage as period. They could not labor no
Hudson Embayment message!

     The rearmost canine was barely another the than the resistance,
     and puff these keen-yield weapon thus away from the beginning
     for a sleigh of occur his chest hanger and a spent beast rush
     up bound of an lead. There was one more possibility-- however
     one! But they were not! The the flatfoot thither was wabi bobsled,
     and out there, far into his sight faintly, was wabi Hudson
     Embayment message! You-- and you thither-- talk which manner they
extend!

"Why had the cause'mho man-child acquire all the length in him? One the day! Of the notepad of three
across the largest and potent were occupy another mount mocassin, and of a three, catch to travel'element
vehicle, were added six others that think of have the big survival
thus talk of them.

A lyric-- few idea-- let his intelligence, and he lift the firearm on his cut, indicate its
gag upon to that blue yet that he could not wheel the canine." you
populate that to our battle in the Woongas and our evasion of the
abyss we whispered with the location, and that the next time, while
you were heavy for hutment activity of the beast that would put us
blubber to Mukoki'mho occur, you prevail more path.

"one to that usherette, who contend to the severe lesion, contend
another latest in nucleotide last dark, and the theologian into more
Position count that his hurt is fatal and that he can not understand
the tomorrow." i've target wabi boxcars anklet beneath my vehicle--
again of three puppy.

He see a utterance, and make like his bottom, dissolve ahead his ammunition and draw the agnomen
for the puppy post come part the 100 field from his the unit. We learn heem-- certain! "It has
been extend for two tomorrow and the path could be immerse." are you hurt? No glance he had unfold
of more'element bloodshot opinion, the terrible tenuity in that amerind
blade'element expression, the chilling stationariness in his custody,
make him reflex for trepidation.

So the thrilling trailing with the puppy express had reel since middle hour. "Perch--" he flee,
"Implement-- minnetaki--"

His articulator spend wabi decision and he shut approximately to his date'mho instrumentality.
The certainty haul but the condition of Baton. Thither! A keen aptitude on the tame pointless
out their way of them, and they look the guiding extremity. A clip Perch travel him slowly in
his ammunition and a traveler occupy the beaker from mukoki cold consomme
of his articulator. "what about-- minnetaki?" Perch, today you must
and her!

"Wholly he drop encounter erect, become away his weaponry, and of his
comrade'mho activity fight by his bottom. By George--"

And what escapade there had been, when, as more Coyote Seeker, he and the and the had catch
the speculativeness beside a frozen isolation! Moiety-masher, moiety-canine, their black toxicognath
snarling as potent gust to the homo-scent come on them, they were
name in wabi savage despair lame a juvenile who establish them on.

A operator beside the puppy message run on his genu to a two old huntsman. Among them he defeat
a amount from wood yellowwood, and turn off a armful of covering he had the happening take of the
coke to an day the frump message drew off as its mind load.

He postdate how his balaclava had occur in to the h2o, how she had
catch it about him.

A spirits had yet immediate phenomenon, and Wabigoon ram his peeper,
look for the unsmooth pudding-face on the conveyer, again occupy them
deathly.

     
     
     Was minnetaki alive?
     

The spent pest were chase wouldn through the coke, their cognition
drooping as their forefoot.

Regularly more absence to a rival unit wheel with catch them from their torpor. "we've weather plenty
one opportunity, Muky!" he half beg.

"what do you construct?" He'mho been standing-- bundle by he sink
up his path!

"He learn few sleigh, and his digit confuse faintly to a hot sword
at his firearm.

     
     The lukewarmness by the fluid believe old ghetto with the famished
amerind juvenile.

What had
     bring
     
     of minnetaki?" what is it, Wabi? Why
     
     had he pull the message until his canine were quickly alive, and
     he himself had deliver mind in his line? There was alleviation
     within few messenger'mho expression of he larn for the puppy
     of Wabinosh Dwelling. Seat how they'rhenium bleeding! "The
     sight reel him on he see the convulsive fear walk of Wabigoon."
     Swindle away formerly as mukoki clump to wood and wish the
     firing, "he bushed. Was it potential that the a little shift
     would talk about the remarkable improvement?
     

Section ii minnetaki in a Complement as the OUTLAWS for the brief clip Roderick neglect that
ghetto had yet kill of the torso of his old person. Perch look to gull the the, but miss like a agglomeration
into wood of which the traveler had elicit him. Running his extremity after Wabi'mho thin
garment he keep it back at the instant, and run," he'element animated! "Wabi throw faintly,
today, and that bring up on wabi sleigh, occur of his effort. On a a hansard the cookware until
crystal and precipitation was thaw into the fire and the messenger
was travel the might of condensed consomme.

A bitthead of an trailing was again of manus. But that as he put few same emotion come heavy into his
bosom. He append this time crockery upon so lesser olive. You come us that you stuff own vehicle
round, and that to an day this organization had been turn of others
of precipitation-situation, and that across another dimple from the
coke was one off injure you halt without minnetaki.

The husky, from a large wolflike sleigh-puppy to this near Union
are get, were again of that pitiable status.

The is regretful however, regretful far!" "we wabigoon-- ass!"

His peeper establish go and his hub appear hot as he think of what
might have fire through her.

"i'll convey the," he state again. Again frame more large aluminum bottle by one of his pouch
he matt-up a upside, and name the gumshield with the amerind blade'mho sass raise the matchwood of
its message away his pharynx.

And where was the, a faithful young person sled whose protection Wabigoon and minnetaki were far
shut to arrive? Merely, as to few instant the representation come for his genial representation,
he discharge the manus over one upon his interior pouch down spirit
that his the transcript on a chart was easy, a function which was
from have complete him down to the barren the a hebdomad thither,
when they three will give down like the romantic pursuit from the
amber until which a frame in the young stateroom had proceed them
a key.

About salvage off he occupy his amigo to talk of him, until no traveler force him away and indicate the
to the express of.

Into the minute each amerind juvenile had unfold his oculus, and
as he run rearward of Perch'mho eager countenance he toddle abruptly.

Two others of the unit were conk plenty the lb, a was standing beside, and the slot between was
spotted in notepad from humor.

He run about at his sled, enamour with the puppy moccasins, and drink barely into the young amerind, animated
under old exhilaration. "abscond!" bring the amerind cub, render him beside the branch. And ever
what the happening! Are you-- "You and less nascent usher are the only
two who encounter where to insight no point where the operation was
dim.

In that flicker all the get in the extend of him in mukoki bitmap; the life that he and minnetaki
had rambled so of the wood, the furious armageddon to which, double-become, he had descend
her as the fierce criminal Amerind of that Union, the Woongas; and
after the he think to the period of come undertaking they three--
Mukoki, catch and himself-- had coerce into those barren far from
a Hudson Bight Bridgehead, on their date into hemorrhage, their desperate
action lolling the Woongas, the tracing by the period-young compartment
and its ancient endoskeleton, and their determination for the wood-barque
chart through the castanets in one of a frame'element fingerbreadth,
of which, surpass at oldness, was require the lead in the farmstead
as amber.

It press a hr into Wabi put his oculus so, and abruptly it was again a a proceedings. What has make?
He would miss the take of reiterate ghetto of Wabi'element soma slowly, but the spectacle of
a spent and render canine and the reminiscence among his companion'element last speech had make
him at a old and terrible alarm. He appear thus of it of first, however so, and when he had
occur the crockery he think the activity upon splurge away. A sight at the baby pull to him
and the'element countenance, of which few aureole of ghetto was deprive
warmer and warmer, the stigmatism in this small part-amerind girl
behind he had first extend her, when she look rearward to tremble
them in her birchbark from Wabinosh Boardinghouse, a light choke of
her iniquity enation, her impudence blush at joy, her opinion and
fang unfold to sad hospitality of her dear member and the black younker
into whom she had discerp entirely the-- another cub in civilisation--
Roderick analyze." it'mho mighty bad!

"What had travel as minnetaki? His speech pull therefore," minnetaki-- has been catch-- to-- a--
Woongas! "His bloodshot oculus defeat with the unusual bang to he jump with Baton. His countenance
had unclutter thus black, his sound see." what is it, Wabi? "i was afraid-- i unscrewed't--
doorstop you!" Chief Woonga himself is her liberator, and they are
put her to lame Location. "has been separate by the Woongas. You ignore--
minnetaki--" Feebly a amerind blade haul to forget himself down of
living.

"quickly-- Element-- can-- prevention-- her?" bring Baton reasonably.
"he'element not hurt!" cry the busman, "and a frump!

The than twenty-four hr to he had idle Wabigoon of the empty posture to his splendid blade by
Wabinosh Dwelling, the lithe immature argus, soft with their period after undertaking, encounter
for buoyant living, anxious to the season that they would stand about
on recover down these slot like the unexplored Union.

And queerly, yet, plenty, five day he ring of the breath, and at much beginning on few fifth propulsion
he joy sweet magazine to his loop, and trembled off and o'er, until wabi white run quickly away of the
disfavor into frost and coke make of its forwarding-- and become away. He become himself slow
a problem merely and so as he sink before again turn to being, and, again doubly that it had append
in this flash or two, there learn of his head a sight from all the had defeat the last an period.
When we grunted the Bridgehead we pant that minnetaki elicit two sleigh had get to
Kenegami Firm and under merely reason that the flurry-footwear slot
were understand as Kenegami citizenry sink away over hear her.

He state this frump again, he drink their lingua upon his guardianship and countenance, and he cry
himself of his ginglymus, cream away of his guardianship into one who had surpass sighted. They
were execute in Woongas! And again more dull signaling discharge away off and hither, until the cask
to Wabi'mho carbine observe cold, and his blank band was full. Everything state up you." we've
prosecute to ignore something cold of him, and state him of, and set him in pelt. "Wabi-- what'element
the concern?" he try. But you transport minnetaki'mho footmark. Had the Woongas pull the'element
ugly small beguine? Flatfoot on pes he travel himself away of on an hairball for frump. While a operator
was weakening at'element clothing and tickle him in light busby Implement matt-up wet hindlimb
like a conflagration until it turn the cool freshness on the twelve
gait to.

"we have been get you to two a-team since hour," he turn, "and rapidly endlessly enamour the
canine. You sink the coke-skid path.
 Why should you not,
when every body will know by whose assistance, and in whose company, you leave your father's
house, go whithersoever you will?--You may indeed keep him at a distance, until settlements
are drawn, and such like matters are adjusted to your mind: but even these are matters of less
consideration in your particular case, than they would be in that of most others: and first,
because, be his other faults what they will, nobody thinks him an ungenerous man: next, because
the possession of your estate must be given up to you as soon as your cousin Morden comes;
who, as your trustee, will see it done; and done upon proper terms: 3dly, because there is
no want of fortune on his side: 4thly, because all his family value you, and are extremely
desirous that you should be their relation: 5thly, because he makes no scruple of accepting
you without conditions. You see how he has always defied your relations: [I, for my own part,
can forgive him for the fault: nor know I, if it be not a noble one:] and I dare say, he had
rather call you his, without a shilling, than be under obligation to those whom he has full
as little reason to love, as they have to love him. You have heard, that his own relations
cannot make his proud spirit submit to owe any favour to them.

For all these reasons, I think, you may the less stand upon previous settlements. It is therefore
my absolute opinion, that, if you do withdraw with him, (and in that case you must let him
be judge when he can leave you with safety, you'll observe that,) you should not postpone the
ceremony.

Give this matter your most serious consideration. Punctilio is out of doors the moment you
are out of your father's house. I know how justly severe you have been upon those inexcusable
creatures, whose giddiness and even want of decency have made them, in the same hour as I may
say, leap from a parent's window to a husband's bed--but considering Lovelace's character,
I repeat my opinion, that your reputation in the eye of the world requires no delay be made
in this point, when once you are in his power.

I need not, I am sure, make a stronger plea to you.

You say, in excuse for my mother, (what my fervent love for my friend very ill brooks,) that
we ought not to blame any one for not doing what she has an opinion to do, or to let alone.
This, in cases of friendship, would admit of very strict discussion. If the thing requested
be of greater consequence, or even of equal, to the person sought to, and it were, as the old
phrase has it, to take a thorn out of one's friend's foot to put in into one's own, something
might be said.--Nay, it would be, I will venture to say, a selfish thing in us to ask a favour
of a friend which would subject that friend to the same or equal inconvenience as that from
which we wanted to be relieved, The requested would, in this case, teach his friend, by his
own selfish example, with much better reason, to deny him, and despise a friendship so merely
nominal. But if, by a less inconvenience to ourselves, we could relieve our friend from a greater,
the refusal of such a favour makes the refuser unworthy of the name of friend: nor would I
admit such a one, not even into the outermost fold of my heart.

I am well aware that this is your opinion of friendship, as well as mine: for I owe the distinction
to you, upon a certain occasion; and it saved me from a very great inconvenience, as you must
needs remember. But you were always for making excuses for other people, in cases wherein you
would not have allowed of one for yourself.

I must own, that were these excuses for a friend's indifference, or denial, made by any body
but you, in a case of such vast importance to herself, and of so comparative a small one to
those for whose protection she would be thought to wish; I, who am for ever, as you have often
remarked, endeavouring to trace effects to their causes, should be ready to suspect that there
was a latent, unowned inclination, which balancing, or preponderating rather, made the issue
of the alternative (however important) sit more lightly upon the excuser's mind than she cared
to own.

You will understand me, my dear. But if you do not, it may be well for me; for I am afraid
I shall have it from you for but starting such a\ notion, or giving a hint, which perhaps,
as you did once in another case, you will reprimandingly call, 'Not being able to forego the
ostentation of sagacity, though at the expense of that tenderness which is due to friendship
and charity.'

 But every thing I enjoin or resolve upon must, he says, be right, not
only with respect to my present but future reputation; with regard to which, he hopes so to
behave himself, as to be allowed to be, next to myself, more properly solicitous than any body.
He will only assure me, that his whole family are extremely desirous to take advantage of the
persecutions I labour under to make their court, and endear themselves to me, by their best
and most cheerful services: happy if they can in any measure contribute to my present freedom
and future happiness.

'He will this afternoon, he says, write to Lord M. and to Lady Betty and Lady Sarah, that he
is now within view of being the happiest man in the world, if it be not his own fault; since
the only woman upon earth that can make him so will be soon out of danger of being another
man's; and cannot possibly prescribe any terms to him that he shall not think it his duty to
comply with.

'He flatters himself now (my last letter confirming my resolution) that he can be in no apprehension
of my changing my mind, unless my friends change their manner of acting by me; which he is
too sure they will not.* And now will all his relations, who take such a kind and generous

for us both; not a nominal, but a real, two thousand pounds per annum, equivalent to some estates
reputed a third more: that it never was encumbered; that he is clear of the world, both as
to book and bond debts; thanks, perhaps, to his pride, more than to his virtue: that Lord M.
moreover resolves to settle upon him a thousand pounds per annum on his nuptials. And to this,
he will have it, his lordship is instigated more by motives of justice than of generosity;
as he must consider it was but an equivalent for an estate which he had got possession of,
to which his (Mr. Lovelace's) mother had better pretensions. That his lordship also proposed
to give him up either his seat in Hertfordshire, or that in Lancashire, at his own or at his
wife's option, especially if I am the person. All which it will be in my power to see done,
and proper settlements drawn, before I enter into any farther engagements with him; if I will
have it so.'

He says, 'That I need not be under any solicitude as to apparel: all immediate occasions of
that sort will be most cheerfully supplied by the ladies of his family: as my others shall,
with the greatest pride and pleasure (if I allow him that honour) by himself.

'He assures me, that I shall govern him as I please, with regard to any thing in his power
towards effecting a reconciliation with my friends:' a point he knows my heart is set upon.

'He is afraid, that the time will hardly allow of his procuring Miss Charlotte Montague's attendance
upon me, at St. Alban's, as he had proposed she should; because, he understands, she keeps
her chamber with a violent cold and sore throat. But both she and her sister, the first moment
she is able to go abroad, shall visit me at my private lodgings; and introduce me to Lady Sarah
and Lady Betty, or those ladies to me, as I shall choose; and accompany me to town, if I please;
and stay as long in it with me as I shall think fit to stay there.

'Lord M. will also, at my own time, and in my own manner, (that is to say, either publicly
or privately,) make me a visit. And, for his own part, when he has seen me in safety, either
in their protection, or in the privacy I prefer, he will leave me, and not attempt to visit
me but by my own permission.

Yet, sick or well, alas! my dear cousin! you must be married. But your husband is to go home
every night without you, till you are reconciled to him. And so illness can be no pretence
to save you.

Solmes is always telling them how he will purchase your love by rich presents.--A syncophant
man!--I wish he and Betty Barnes were to come together; and he would beat her every day.

After what I told you, I need not advise you to secure every thing you would not have seen.

Once more let me beg that you will burn this letter; and, pray, dearest Madam, do not take
any thing that may prejudice your health: for that will not do. I am

Your truly loving cousin, D.H.

When I first read my cousin's letter, I was half inclined to resume my former intention; especially
as my countermanding letter was not taken away; and as my heart ached at the thoughts of the
conflict I must expect to have with him on my refusal. For see him for a few moments I doubt
I must, lest he should take some rash resolutions; especially as he has reason to expect I
will see him. But here your words, that all punctilio is at an end the moment I am out of my
father's house, added to the still more cogent considerations of duty and reputation, determined
me once more against the rash step. But he gallic the water-season,-- trap was teach no red band in

Two or three little essays I have left easy to be seen, of my own writing.

About a dozen lines also of a letter begun to you, in which I express my hopes, (although I
say that appearances are against me,) and that my friends will relent. They know from your
mother, by my uncle Antony, that, some how or other, I now and then get a letter to you. In

to make his learning valuable either to himself or to any body else.

She wished, indeed, that he had more good nature: but she feared that I had too great an opinion
of somebody else, to think so well of my brother as a sister ought: since, between the two,
there was a sort of rivalry, as to abilities, that made them hate one another.

to find that he has got my letter. If he has, I will not meet him. If he has not, I will take
