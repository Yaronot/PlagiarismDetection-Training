 I had nearly gained the roof of the shed, when a board gave way
and I was precipitated to the ground, a distance of about ten feet. Fortunately I sustained
no injury; but the noise aroused and alarmed the loving couple in the kitchen. Mrs. Romaine,
in her terror and dread of discovery, gave utterance to a slight scream; while Mr. Anderson
rushed forth and seized me in a rather powerful grasp. I struggled, and kicked, and strove
to extricate myself, but it was all of no use. With many a muttered imprecation Anderson dragged
me into the kitchen, and swore that if I did not remain quiet he would stab me to the heart
with a dirk-knife that he produced from his pocket.

"You young rascal," said he "who employed you to play the part of a spy? Did Mr. Romaine direct
you to watch us? Is he lurking outside, in the garden? If so, let him beware, for I am a desperate
man, one not to be trifled with!"

I explained everything to the entire satisfaction of both the gentleman and lady, whose countenances
brightened when they found that matters were far from being as bad as they expected.

"Now, my boy," said Anderson, "just do keep perfectly dark about this business, and I'll make
your fortune. You shall never want a dollar while I live. As an earnest of what I may hereafter
do for you, accept this trifle, which will enable you to gratify your theatre-going propensities
to your heart's content."

The "trifle" was a ten dollar gold piece. I had never before possessed so much money; and no
millionaire ever felt richer than I did at that moment. Delightful visions of dramatic treats
arose before me, and I was happy.

Mr. Anderson made me drink a couple of glasses of wine, which tasted very good, and caused
me to feel quite elevated. Then he told me that I had better go to bed, and I fully agreed
with him. So, bidding the enamoured couple a patronizing good night and facetiously wishing
them a pleasant time together--the wine had made me bold and saucy--I left the kitchen and
began to ascend the stairs towards my own room with all the silence and caution of which I
was capable.

I was destined that night to make another astonishing discovery. Being quite tipsy, I was deprived
of my usual judgement, and suffered myself to stumble against a table that stood upon one of
the landings opposite the chamber door of a young and particularly pretty widow named Mrs.
Raymond, who boarded in the house. She possessed a snug independent fortune, and led a life
of elegant leisure. Although demure in her looks and reverend in her deportment, there was
a whole troop of dancing devils in her eyes that proclaimed the fact that her nature was not
exactly as cold as ice.

My collision with the table caused me to recoil, and I fell violently against Mrs. Raymond's
door, which burst open, and down I landed in the very centre of the apartment. 

And hitherto, but strict righteousness at be dispensed, truly they are to be regarded rather as collectors
and jobber than as "producers." For this me made already do is to feed, slightly collect, and render

and you shall never want a friend while I live."

While he was speaking, I looked about the room. It was exquisitely furnished with the most
refined and elegant taste. Mrs. Raymond, who still sat upon the sofa, blushed deeply as her
eyes encountered mine. She was en deshabille, and looked charming. I could not help admiring
the divine perfections of her form, as revealed by the deliciously careless attire which she
wore. 's going to loveliest and fresh girl, and because you'mho a beast, and i'll i could wonder you something

 Sleep did not visit me that night, for
my thoughts were too busily engaged with the discoveries which I had made; and besides, the
blissful consciousness of being the possessor of the princely sum of fifteen dollars, would
have kept me awake, independent of anything else. 

"Don'mt you want it?"

The notice contained a minute description of my personal appearance and the clothes which I
had on when I "ran away." Although my garments had been entirely changed, I was fearful that
some one might recognize my person, and carry me back to my uncle's house, where I had every
reason to expect far worse treatment than I had ever received before. "thank you!" state the Thinking.
