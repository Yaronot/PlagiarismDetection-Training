Phyllis went singing on down the sunny old house, swinging her colored muslin skirts and prancing
a little with sheer joy of being twenty-five, and prettily dressed, with a dear house all her
own, and--yes--a dear Allan a little her own, too! Doing well for a man what another woman
has done badly has a perennial joy for a certain type of woman, and this was what Phyllis was
in the very midst of. She pranced a little more, and came almost straight up against a long
old mirror with gilt cornices, which had come with the house and was staying with it. Phyllis
stopped and looked critically at herself.

"I haven't taken time yet to be pretty," she reminded the girl in the glass, and began then
and there to take account of stock, by way of beginning. Why--a good deal had done itself!
Her hair had been washed and sunned and sunned and washed about every ten minutes since she
had been away from the library. It was springy and three shades more golden. She had not been
rushing out in all weathers unveiled, nor washing hastily with hard water and cheap library
soap eight or ten times a day, because private houses are comparatively clean places. So her
complexion had been getting back, unnoticed, a good deal of its original country rose-and-cream,
with a little gold glow underneath. And the tired heaviness was gone from her eyelids, because
she had scarcely used her eyes since she had married Allan--there had been too much else to
do! The little frown-lines between the brows had gone, too, with the need of reading-glasses
and work under electricity. She was more rounded, and her look was less intent. The strained
Liberry Teacher look was gone. The luminous long blue eyes in the glass looked back at her
girlishly. "Would you think we were twenty-five even?" they said. Phyllis smiled irrepressibly
at the mirrored girl.

"Yas'm," said the rich and comfortable voice of Lily-Anna, the cook, from the dining-room door;
"you sholy is pretty. Yas'm--a lady wants to stay pretty when she's married. Yo' don' look
much mo'n a bride, ma'am, an' dat's a fac'. Does you want yo' dinnehs brought into de sittin'-room
regular till de gem'man gits well?"

"Yes--no--yes--for the present, any way," said Phyllis, with a mixture of confusion and dignity.
Fortunately the doorbell chose this time to ring.

A business-like young messenger with a rocking crate wanted to speak to the madam. The last
item on Phyllis's shopping list had come.

"The wolfhound's doing fine, ma'am," the messenger answered in response to her questions. "Like
a different dog already. All he needed was exercise and a little society. Yes'm, this pup's
broken--in a manner, that is. Your man picked you out the best-tempered little feller in the
litter. Here, Foxy--careful, lady! Hold on to his leash!"

There was the passage of the check, a few directions about dog-biscuits, and then the messenger
from the kennels drove back to the station, the crate, which had been emptied of a wriggling
six-months black bull-dog, on the seat beside him.

XII

Allan, lying at the window of the sunny bedroom, and wondering if they had been having springs
like this all the time he had lived in the city, heard a scuffle outside the door. His wife's
voice inquired breathlessly of Wallis, "Can Mr. Allan--see me?... Oh, gracious--don't, Foxy,
you little black gargoyle! Open the door, or--shut it--quick, Wallis!"

But the door, owing to circumstances over which nobody but the black dog had any control, flew
violently open here, and Allan had a flying vision of his wife, flushed, laughing, and badly
mussed, being railroaded across the room by a prancingly exuberant French bull at the end of
a leash.

"He's--he's a cheerful dog," panted Phyllis, trying to bring Foxy to anchor near Allan, "and
I don't think he knows how to keep still long enough to pose across your feet--he wouldn't
become them anyhow--he's a real man-dog, Allan, not an interior decoration.... Oh, Wallis,
he has Mr. Allan's slipper! Foxy, you little fraud! Did him want a drink, angel-puppy?"

"Did you get him for me, Phyllis?" asked Allan when the tumult and the shouting had died, and
the caracoling Foxy had buried his hideous little black pansy-face in a costly Belleek dish
of water.

"Yes," gasped Phyllis from her favorite seat, the floor; "but you needn't keep him unless you
want to. I can keep him where you'll never see him--can't I, honey-dog-gums? Only I thought
he'd be company for you, and don't you think he seems--cheerful?"

Allan threw his picturesque head back on the cushions, and laughed and laughed.

"Cheerful!" he said. "Most assuredly! Why--thank you, ever so much, Phyllis. You're an awfully
thoughtful girl. I always did like bulls--had one in college, a Nelson. Come here, you little
rascal!"

He whistled, and the puppy lifted its muzzle from the water, made a dripping dash to the couch,
and scrambled up over Allan as if they had owned each other since birth. Never was a dog less
weighed down by the glories of ancestry.

Allan pulled the flopping bat-ears with his most useful hand, and asked with interest, "Why
on earth did they call a French bull Foxy?"

"Yes, sir," said Wallis. "I understand, sir, that he was the most active and playful of the
litter, and chewed up all his brothers' ears, sir. And the kennel people thought it was so
clever that they called him Foxy."

"The best-tempered dog in the litter!" cried Phyllis, bursting into helpless laughter from
the floor.

"That doesn't mean he's bad-tempered," explained master and man eagerly together. Phyllis began
to see that she had bought a family pet as much for Wallis as for Allan. She left them adoring
the dog with that reverent emotion which only very ugly bull-dogs can wake in a man's breast,
and flitted out, happy over the success of her new toy for Allan.

"Take him out when he gets too much for Mr. Allan," she managed to say softly to Wallis as
she passed him. But, except for a run or so for his health, Wallis and Allan between them kept
the dog in the bedroom most of the day. Phyllis, in one of her flying visits, found the little
fellow, tired with play, dog-biscuits, and other attentions, snuggled down by his master, his
little crumpled black muzzle on the pillow close to Allan's contented, sleeping face. She felt
as if she wanted to cry. The pathetic lack of interests which made the coming of a new little
dog such an event!

Before she hung one more picture, before she set up even a book from the boxes which had been
her father's, before she arranged one more article of furniture, she telephoned to the village
for the regular delivery of four daily papers, and a half-dozen of the most masculine magazines
she could think of on the library lists. She had never known of Allan's doing any reading.
That he had cared for books before the accident, she knew. At any rate, she was resolved to
leave no point uncovered that might, just possibly might, help her Allan just a little way
to interest in life, which she felt to be the way to recovery. He liked being told stories
to, any way.

"Do you think Mr. Allan will feel like coming into the living-room to-day?" she asked Wallis,
meeting him in the hall about two o'clock.

"Why, he's dressed, ma'am," was Wallis's astonishing reply, "and him and the pup is having
a fine game of play. He's got more use of that hand an' arm, ma'am, than we thought."

"Do you think he'd care to be wheeled into the living-room about four?" asked Phyllis.

"For tea, ma'am?" inquired Wallis, beaming. "I should think so, ma'am. I'll ask, anyhow."

Phyllis had not thought of tea--one does not stop for such leisurely amenities in a busy public
library--but she saw the beauty of the idea, and saw to it that the tea was there. Lily-Anna
was a jewel. She built the fire up to a bright flame, and brought in some daffodils from the
garden without a word from her mistress. Phyllis herself saw that the victrola was in readiness,
and cleared a space for the couch near the fire. There was quite a festal feeling.

The talking-machine was also a surprise for Allan. Phyllis thought afterward that she should
have saved it for another day, but the temptation to grace the occasion with it was too strong.
She and Allan were as excited over it as a couple of children, and the only drawback to Allan's
enjoyment was that he obviously wanted to take the records out of her unaccustomed fingers
and adjust them himself. He knew how, it appeared, and Phyllis naturally didn't. However, she
managed to follow his directions successfully. She had bought recklessly of rag-time discs,
and provided a fair amount of opera selections. Allan seemed equally happy over both. After
the thing had been playing for three-quarters of an hour, and most of the records were exhausted,
Phyllis rang for tea. It was getting a little darker now, and the wood-fire cast fantastic
red and black lights and shadows over the room. It was very intimate and thrilling to Phyllis
suddenly, the fire-lit room, with just their two selves there. Allan, on his couch before the
fire, looked bright and contented. The adjustable couch-head had been braced to such a position
that he was almost sitting up. The bull-dog, who had lately come back from a long walk with
the gratified outdoor man, snored regularly on the rug near his master, wakening enough to
bat his tail on the floor if he was referred to. The little tea-table was between Allan and
Phyllis, crowned with a bunch of apple-blossoms, whose spring-like scent dominated the warm
room. Phyllis, in her green gown, her cheeks pink with excitement, was waiting on her lord
and master a little silently.

Allan watched her amusedly for awhile--she was as intent as a good child over her tea-ball
and her lemon and her little cakes.

"Say something, Phyllis," he suggested with the touch of mischief she was not yet used to,
coming from him.

"This is a serious matter," she replied gravely. "Do you know I haven't made tea--afternoon
tea, that is--for so long it's a wonder I know which is the cup and which is the saucer?"

"Why not?" he asked idly, yet interestedly too.

"I was otherwise occupied. I was a Daughter of Toil," explained Phyllis serenely, setting down
her own cup to relax in her chair, hands behind her head; looking, in her green gown, the picture
of graceful, strong, young indolence. "I was a librarian--didn't you know?"

"No. I wish you'd tell me, if you don't mind," said Allan. "About you, I mean, Phyllis. Do
you know, I feel awfully married to you this afternoon--you've bullied me so much it's no wonder--and
I really ought to know about my wife's dark past."

Phyllis's heart beat a little faster. She, too, had felt "awfully married" here alone in the
fire-lit living-room, dealing so intimately and gayly with Allan.

"There isn't much to tell," she said soberly.

"Come over here closer," commanded Allan the spoilt. "We've both had all the tea we want. Come
close by the couch. I want to see you when you talk."

Phyllis did as he ordered.

"I was a New England country minister's daughter," she began. "New England country ministers
always know lots about Greek and Latin and how to make one dollar do the work of one-seventy-five,
but they never have any dollars left when the doing's over. Father and I lived alone together
always, and he taught me things, and I petted him--fathers need it, specially when they have
country congregations--and we didn't bother much about other folks. Then he--died. I was eighteen,
and I had six hundred dollars. I couldn't do arithmetic, because Father had always said it
was left out of my head, and I needn't bother with it. So I couldn't teach. Then they said,
'You like books, and you'd better be a librarian.' As a matter of fact, a librarian never gets
a chance to read, but you can't explain that to the general public. So I came to the city and
took the course at library school. Then I got a position in the Greenway Branch--two years
in the circulating desk, four in the cataloguing room, and one in the Children's Department.
The short and simple annals of the poor!"

"Go on," said Allan.

"I believe it's merely that you like the sound of the human voice," said Phyllis, laughing.
"I'm going to go on with the story of the Five Little Pigs--you'll enjoy it just as much!"

"Exactly," said Allan. "Tell me what it was like in the library, please."

"It was rather interesting," said Phyllis, yielding at once. "There are so many different things
to be done that you never feel any monotony, as I suppose a teacher does. But the hours are
not much shorter than a department store's, and it's exacting, on-your-feet work all the time.
I liked the work with the children best. Only--you never have any time to be anything but neat
in a library, and you do get so tired of being just neat, if you're a girl."

"And a pretty one," said Allan. "I don't suppose the ugly ones mind as much."

It was the first thing he had said about her looks. Phyllis's ready color came into her cheeks.
So he thought she was pretty!

"Do you--think I'm pretty?" she asked breathlessly. She couldn't help it.

"Of course I do, you little goose," said Allan, smiling at her.

Phyllis plunged back into the middle of her story:

"You see, you can't sit up nights to sew much, or practise doing your hair new ways, because
you need all your strength to get up when the alarm-clock barks next morning. And then, there's
always the money-worry, if you have nothing but your salary. Of course, this last year, when
I've been getting fifty dollars a month, things have been all right. -- weeknight, oh buy it was alone

His face shadowed a little as he spoke, for nearly the first time, of the dead girl.

"Allan," Phyllis said, bending closer to him, all rosy and golden in her green hammock, "tell
me about--Louise Frey--if you don't mind talking about her? Would it be bad for you, do you think?"

Allan's eyes dwelt on his wife pleasurably. She was very real and near and lovable, and Louise
Frey seemed far away and shadowy in his thoughts. He had loved her very dearly and passionately,
that boisterous, handsome young Louise, but that gay boy-life she had belonged to seemed separated
now from this pleasant rose-garden, with its golden-haired, wisely-sweet young chatelaine,
by thousands of black years. The blackness came back when he remembered what lay behind it.

"There's nothing much to tell, Phyllis," he said, frowning a little. "She was pretty and full
of life. She had black hair and eyes and a good deal of color. We were more or less friends
all our lives, for our country-places adjoined. She was eighteen when--it happened."

"Eighteen," said Phyllis musingly. "She would have been just my age.... We won't talk about
it, then, Allan ... Well, Viola?"

The pretty Tuskegee chambermaid was holding out a tray with a card on it.

"The doctor, ma'am," she said.

"The doctor!" echoed Allan, half-vexed, half-laughing. "I knew you had something up your sleeve,
Phyllis! What on earth did you have him for?"

Phyllis's face was a study of astonishment. "On my honor, I hadn't a notion he was even in
existence," she protested. "He's not my doctor!"

"He must have 'just growed,' or else Lily-Anna's called him in," suggested Allan sunnily. "Bring
him along, Viola."

Viola produced him so promptly that nobody had time to remember the professional doctor's visits
don't usually have cards, or thought to look at the card for enlightenment. So the surprise
was complete when the doctor appeared.

"Johnny Hewitt!" ejaculated Allan, throwing out both hands in greeting. "Of all people! Well,
you old fraud, pretending to be a doctor! The last I heard about you, you were trying to prove
that you weren't the man that tied a mule into old Sumerley's chair at college."

"I never did prove it," responded Johnny Hewitt, shaking hands vigorously, "but the fellows
said afterwards that I ought to apologize--to the mule. He was a perfectly good mule. But I'm
a doctor all right. I live here in Wallraven. I wondered if it might be you by any chance,
Allan, when I heard some Harringtons had bought here. But this is the first chance a promising
young chickenpox epidemic has given me to find out."

"It's what's left of me," said Allan, smiling ruefully. "And--Phyllis, this doctor-person turns
out to be an old friend of mine. This is Mrs. Harrington, Johnny."

"Oh, I'm so glad!" beamed Phyllis, springing up from her hammock, and looking as if she loved
Johnny. Here was exactly what was needed--somebody for Allan to play with! She made herself
delightful to the newcomer for a few minutes, and then excused herself. They would have a better
time alone, for awhile, any way, and there was dinner to order. Maybe this Johnny Hewitt-doctor
would stay for dinner. He should if she could make him! She sang a little on her way to the
house, and almost forgot the tiny hurt it had been when Allan seemed so saddened by speaking
of Louise Frey. She had no right to feel hurt, she knew. It was only to be expected that Allan
would always love Louise's memory. She didn't know much about men, but that was the way it
always was in stories. A man's heart would die, under an automobile or anywhere else, and all
there was left for anybody else was leavings. It wasn't fair! And then Phyllis threw back her
shoulders and laughed, as she had sometimes in the library days, and reminded herself what
a nice world it was, any way, and that Allan was going to be much helped by Johnny Hewitt.
That was a cheering thought, anyhow. She went on singing, and ordered a beautiful, festively-varied
dinner, a very poem of gratitude. Then she pounced on the doctor as he was leaving and made
him stay for it.

Allan's eyes were bright and his face lighted with interest. Phyllis, at the head of the table,
kept just enough in the talk to push the men on when it seemed flagging, which was not often.
She learned more about Allan, and incidentally Johnny Hewitt, in the talk as they lingered
about the table, than she had ever known before. She and Allan had lived so deliberately in
the placid present, with its almost childish brightnesses and interests, that she knew scarcely
more about her husband's life than the De Guenthers had told her before she married him. But
she could see the whole picture of it as she listened now: the active, merry, brilliant boy
who had worked and played all day and danced half the night; who had lived, it almost seemed
to her, two or three lives in one. And then the change to the darkened room--helpless, unable
to move, with the added sorrow of his sweetheart's death, and his mother's deliberate fostering
of that sorrow. It was almost a shock to see him in the wheel-chair at the foot of the table,
his face lighted with interest in what he and his friend were saying. What if he did care for
Louise Frey's memory still! He'd had such a hard time that anything Phyllis could do for him
oughtn't to be too much! 

This objection, till a I found it cold to rise out on my return to Allan. Of the day at the mountains
about Palestrina were covered there with coke; and the air became thus necessary of Rome, that i
was forced to put him on my winter. He promised to come back
very soon, and see as much of them as possible.
