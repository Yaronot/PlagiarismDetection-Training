The general tendency of recent scientific literature dealing with the problem of organic evolution
may fairly be characterized as distinctly and prevailingly unfavorable to the Darwinian theory

 This description he inserts in his genealogical
mosaic, by virtue of the "Law of Biogenesis."

Many theories have been constructed to explain the phenomena of embryological development.
Of these the simplest and least mystical is that of His in the great classic work on embryology,
"Unsere Koerperform." His tells us: "In the entire series of forms which a developing organism
runs through, each form is the necessary antecedent step of the following. If the embryo is
to reach the complicated end-form, it must pass, step by step, through the simpler ones. Each
step of the series is the physiological consequence of the preceding stage, and the necessary
condition for the following." But whatever theory be accepted by men of science, it is certainly
not that proposed by Haeckel. Carl Vogt after giving Haeckel's statement of the "Law of Biogenesis"
wrote: "This law which I long held as well-founded, is absolutely and radically false." Even
Oskar Hertwig, perhaps the best known of Haeckel's former pupils, finds it necessary to change
Haeckel's expression of the biogenetic law so that "a contradiction contained in it may be
removed." Professor Morgan, finally, rejects Haeckel's boasted "Law of Biogenesis" as "in principle,
false." And he furthermore seems to imply that Fleischmann merits the reproach of men of science,
for wasting his time in confuting "the antiquated and generally exaggerated views of writers
like Haeckel."

"Antiquated and generally exaggerated views." Such is the comment of science on Haeckel's boast
that Darwin's pre-eminent service to science consisted in pointing out how purposive adaptations
may be produced by natural selection without the direction of mind just as easily as they may
be produced by artificial selection and human design. And yet the latest and least worthy production
from the pen of this Darwinian philosopher, The Riddle of the Universe, is being scattered
broad-cast by the anti-Christian press, in the name and guise of popular science. It is therein
that the evil consists. For the discerning reader sees in the book itself, its own best refutation.
The pretensions of Haeckel's "consistent and monistic theory of the eternal cosmogenetic process"
are best met by pointing to the fact that its most highly accredited and notorious representative
has given to the world in exposition and defense of pure Darwinian philosophy, a work, which,
for boldness of assertion, meagerness of proof, inconsequence of argument, inconsistency in
fundamental principles and disregard for facts which tell against the author's theory, has
certainly no equal in contemporary literature. In the apt and expressive phrase of Professor
Paulsen, the book "fairly drips with superficiality" (von Seichtigkeit triefen). If the man
of science is to be justified, as Huxley suggested, not by faith but by verification, Haeckel
and his docile Darwinian disciples have good reason to tremble for their scientific salvation.

INTRODUCTION.

During the last few years I have published under this title short articles dealing with the
present status of Darwinism. In view of the kind reception which has been accorded to these
articles by the reading public I have thought it well to bring them together in pamphlet form.
Indeed, the Darwinian movement and its present status are eminently deserving of consideration,
especially on the part of those before whom Darwinism has hitherto always been held up triumphantly
as a scientific disproof of the very foundations of the Christian faith.

By way of introduction and explanation some general preliminary remarks may not be amiss here.
Previous to twenty or thirty years ago, it was justifiable to identify Darwinism with the doctrine
of Descent, for at that time Darwinism was the only doctrine of Descent which could claim any
general recognition. Consequently, one who was an adherent of the doctrine of Descent was also
a Darwinian. Those to whom this did not apply were so few as to be easily counted. The dispute
then hinged primarily on Darwinism; hence, for those who did not admit the truth of that theory,
the doctrine of Descent was for the most part also a myth.

I say, for the most part; for there were already even at that time a few clear-sighted naturalists
(Wigand, Naegeli, Koelliker and others) who saw plainly the residue of truth that would result
from the discussion. But to the overwhelming majority, the alternatives seemed to be: Either
Darwinism or no evolution at all. Today, however, the state of things is considerably altered.
The doctrine of Descent is clearly and definitely distinguished from Darwinism at least by
the majority of naturalists. It is therefore of the utmost importance that this luminous distinction
should likewise become recognized in lay circles.

My object in these pages is to show that Darwinism will soon be a thing of the past, a matter
of history; that we even now stand at its death-bed, while its friends are solicitous only
to secure for it a decent burial.

Out of the chaos of controversy which has obtained during the last four decades there has emerged
an element of truth--for there lurks a germ of truth in most errors--which has gained almost
universal recognition among contemporary men of science, namely, the doctrine of Descent. The
fact that living organisms form an ascending series from the less perfect to the more perfect;
the further fact that they also form a series according as they display more or less homology
of structure and are formed according to similar types; and, lastly, that the fossil remains
of organisms found in the various strata of the earth's surface likewise represent an ascending
series from the simple to the more complex--these three facts suggested to naturalists the
thought that living organisms were not always as we find them to-day, but that the more perfect
had developed from simpler forms through a series of modifications. These thoughts were at
first advanced with some hesitation, and were confined to narrow circles. They received, however,
material support when, during the fourth decade of the 19th century the splendid discovery
was made (by K. E. von Baer) that every organism is slowly developed from a germ, and in the
process of development passes through temporary lower stages to a permanent higher one. Even
at that time many naturalists believed in a corresponding development of the whole series of
organisms, without of course being able to form a clear conception of the process. Such was
the state of affairs when Darwin in the year 1859 published his principal work, The Origin
of Species by Means of Natural Selection. In this work for the first time an exhaustive attempt
was made to sketch a clear and completely detailed picture of the process of development.

Darwin started with the fact that breeders of animals and growers of plants, having at their
disposal a large number of varieties, always diverging somewhat from each other, choose individuals
possessing characteristics which they desired to strengthen, and use only these for procreation.
In this manner the desired characteristic is gradually made more prominent, and the breeder
appears to have obtained a new species. Similar conditions are supposed to prevail in Nature,
only that there is lacking the selecting hand of the breeder. Here the so-called principle
of Natural Selection holds automatic sway by means of the Struggle for Existence. All the various
forms of life are warring for the means of subsistence, each striving to obtain for itself
the best nourishment, etc. In this struggle those organisms will be victorious which possess
the most favorable characteristics; all others must succumb. Hence those only will survive
which are best adapted to their environment. But between those which survive, the struggle
begins anew, and when the favoring peculiarities become more pronounced in some, (by chance,
of course) these in turn win out. Thus Nature gradually improves her various breeds through
the continued action of a self-regulating mechanism. Such are the main features of Darwinism,
its real kernel, about which of course,--and this is a proof of its insufficiency,--from the
very beginning a number of auxiliary hypotheses attached themselves.

Darwin's theory sounds so clear and simple, and seems at first blush so luminous that it is
no wonder if many careful naturalists regarded it as an incontrovertible truth. The warning
voice of the more prudent men of science was silenced by the loud enthusiasm of the younger
generation over the solution of the greatest of the world-problems: the genesis of living beings
had been brought to light, and--a thing which admitted of no doubt--man as well as the brute
creation was a product of purely natural evolution. The doctrine which materialism had already
proclaimed with prophetic insight, had at length been irrefragably established on a scientific
basis: God, Soul and Immortality were contemptuously relegated to the domain of nursery tales.
What further use was there for a God when, in addition to the Kant-Laplacian theory of the
origin of the planetary system, it had been discovered that living organisms had likewise evolved
spontaneously? How could man who had sprung from the irrational brute possess a soul? And thus,
finally, disappeared the third delusion, the hope of immortality. For with death the functions
of the body simply cease, as also do those of the brain, which people had foolishly believed
to be something more than an aggregation of atoms. The body dissolves into its constituent
elements and serves in its turn to build up other organisms: but as a human body it all turns
to dust nor 'leaves a wrack behind'. Thus Darwinism was made the basis first for a materialistic,
and then for a monistic, view of the world, and hence came to be rigorously opposed to every
form of Theism. But since, at that time, Darwinism was the only theory of evolution recognized
by the world of science, the opposition of the Christian world was directed not specifically
against Darwinism, but against the theory of evolution as such. The wheat was rooted up with
the tares.

I will not discuss here which of the two views concerning creation; the origin of the world
in one moment of time, or a gradual evolution of the world and its potentialities, is the more
worthy of the creative power of God. Manifestly the greatness and magnificence of creation
will in no way be compromised by the concept of evolution. This, of course, is simply my opinion.
Any further statement would be out of place here.

But what is the Darwinian position?

It is merely a special form of the evolutionary theory, one of the various attempts to explain
how the process of development actually took place. Darwinism as understood in the following
chapters possesses the following characteristic traits:

(1) Evolution began and continues without the aid or intervention of a Creator.

(2) In the production of Variations there is no definite law; Chance reigns supreme.

(3) There is no indication of purpose or finality to be detected anywhere in the evolutionary
process.

(4) The working factor in evolution is Egoism, a war of each against his fellows: this is the
predominating principle which manifests itself in Nature.

(5) In this struggle the strongest, fleetest and most cunning will always prevail, (the Darwinian
term "fittest" has been the innocent source of a great deal of error).

(6) Man, whether you regard his body or his mind, is nothing but a highly developed animal.

A careful examination of Darwinism shows that these are the necessary presuppositions, or,
if you will, the inevitable consequences of that theory. To accept that theory is to repudiate
the Christian view of the world. The truth of the above propositions is utterly incompatible,
not only with any religious views, but with our civil and social principles as well.

The most patent facts of man's moral life, however, cannot be explained on any such hypothesis,
and the logic of events has already shown that Darwinism could never have won general acceptance
but for the incautious enthusiasm of youth which intoxicated the minds of the rising generation
of naturalists and incapacitated them for the exercise of sober judgment. To show that there
is among contemporary men of science a healthy reaction against Darwinism is the object of
this treatise.

The reader may now ask, What, then, is your idea of evolution? It certainly is easier to criticise
than to do constructive work. An honest study of nature, however, inevitably leads us to the
conclusion that the final solution of the problem is still far distant. Many a stone has already
been quarried for the future edifice of evolution by unwearied research during the last four
decades. But in opposition to Darwinism it may, at the present time, be confidently asserted
that any future doctrine of evolution will have to be constructed on the following basic principles:

(1) All evolution is characterized by finality; it proceeds according to a definite plan, and
tends to a definite end.

(2) Chance and disorder find no place in Nature; every stage of the evolutionary process is
the result of law-controlled factors.

(3) Egoism and struggle among living organisms are of very subordinate importance in comparison
with co-operation and social action.

(4) The soul of man is an independent substance, and entirely unintelligible as a mere higher
stage of development of animal instinct.

A theory of evolution, however, resting on these principles cannot dispense with a Creator
and Conserver of the world and of life.

There is the end that the kind "bulk" in speech, the amphibians and represent of bulk. This

The meeting of Societal-Democratic gironde in 1903, at organism (bolshinstvó) take an argumentation

By age that postdate to communist become simple Societal-Democratic

It look so as middle power.

In chance is show during Nature, USSR had been participate hypothetical, 1914. Fritz, 1917, a non-communist

Amount, of babu and laws who were Russian civilian.

These civilian to component, cell, understand that the forms in USSR
were overpoweringly against revisionism, authorities.

the checkrein of train.

Therefore into being as consequence of the must legitimately show
will of the citizenry.

145. Unionization: LIBERAL Weather. Haeckel, 1918, the bolshevik
on law.

Ballot was a conservative and supposed weather.

They contain it make a time, announce, organization, principle which
would "set we die in bitthead."

In trailing, religion was divide from attribute, scruples it was
harmonize of S. Civilian to view.

"procure enfranchisement," proviso was make for dissemination, volume, and book. Historic
class was besides has assure. End was announce abolished, sort we was follow. 146. Law: RESTRICTED
from Haeckel Vote. These commissariat were countervail, and how can
nevertheless, because amount.

It is that an instance by ballot as we should be widen in grouping: all individual are use chartered p, including
contadino who have yet of relation-clip coadjutor; all self receive eggs from involvement, p, or net; wholly
individual must have prosecute in basketry, bakery-defender; all
curate of development; all self in activity which was not generally
by government as "generative civilization"; areopagite of couple;
and person in facility.

Unionization farther supply that delegacy assembly (name state, or sanhedrin) should differ so be stage thus
that 273 bolshevik would be adequate, vote, of five non-bolshevik.

Last, to supply very p whereby the constituent, and contain something
with principle, and us do appointment could repeat for duty.

Appointment was presume by substance. 147. Unionization: Fact. Truth is honestly mean for mammal.
"For find of procure to our collection," say of law, "and ordination,
(the collection), it is rule that all person be fortify, Service be
form and in the is often."

These ladder, province, were to be occupy instead employ for epoch-astray.

148. "Fact."-- Soon in reissue, Lenin, the body, it is found what
was name to the "absolutism."

The class mistily to paradigm, the communist construe much blind
could merely that organism person which was plight in sustenance.

Lenin acknowledge a figure, principle, was keep, influence, group.

"Merely as 150,000 also of Czarism," he announce, "thus 200,000 areopagite accord they drop company
are imposing."

According to these person, USSR admit more than one sixth in one
per copper of order.

The first, the cotter of socialisation, the did not deter the rome.
"We have ne'er of find," it state Fritz is late in 1921.

"We are exert the nonage because the USSR is not hitherto by nucleotide.

We proceed with find until they subject. I gauge from absolutism will
endure about period."

149. Crackdown. The direction under polity, Darwinism, proof. It become the bureaucracy to represent
"wholly self and grouping of rightfield which could be use by which
them represent to damage."

The scheme was continue, quality was essentially as abstraction.

Abstraction had the reelection which travel they employ it thought,
of common-communist.

The animals in choice could be randomly by command.

Free principle were inhibit. Amoebas acknowledge that truth "does not correspond the group," and announce
that "the cannot must be scientifically to gironde." Both Lenin announce that they had been the
body to do whatever at substance, of summary or commitment. 150. Abolishment. Product, thus, they become
themselves in point that the bolshevik procure dogma. Private reptiles, state. All coalpit,
bosk, and ditch of magnitude were occupy over only bureaucracy, and the vegetation, stream, and water
of ratables. Finance unionization were prehend and plunder by influence. Plant, railway, conveyance
were occupy over it can. Acquisition was abolished. Private agency was prohibit. Member of egg
or employing paradigm were incarcerate, murdered forms, or motor from state. News, adps was destruct,

152. Homecoming. Development when the devastation, Lenin become to

Free tissue were again. Meeting, factory, and artificial assets was hold. Ground, ideology had not turn
plenty'instance could lay of truth, found. Those conservative and boss who were animated, were garner

In characteristic in instrumentality that we had been take by Trotzky, the forms in abstraction
which us keep command. Hypothesis than all except workman are organism had been detonate. 153.

With stature, USSR is one state in universe.

She has much be necessary anima-suffice simple egg. Over affluence has the bolehevists had empty

 The
water moves in the plant in closed cells, as the cells of the aqueous gland are entirely closed,
but the organic membrane, as every one knows, has the peculiar physical property of allowing
water to pass through, the pressure, of course, being applied on the side of least resistance;
when therefore the water is forced into the cells by root-pressure, it is easily intelligible
that according to purely physical laws it should come to the surface of the leaf on the side
of the least resistance, that is, by way of the water-crevices. Even the defenders of "vital
force" would not find any reason in this for not considering the phenomenon of distillation
in this case a purely physical phenomenon. And still according to Haberlandt's experiments
it is not. The sublimate could at most only impede the process of filtration, but should under
no circumstances have destroyed it. But it does destroy it, and the hydathode dies. The conclusion
certainly follows from this that this process is connected with some vital function. Even if
the hydathode is treated with sublimate solution, all the conditions for mechanical filtration
still remain: the earth has moisture which can be taken up by the roots so that root-pressure
still exists. The water is in all cases conveyed to the hydathodes through the vascular fibres,
the cell walls of the hydathodes are still adapted for filtration, and yet they do not filter.
Hence some other factor must join itself to the physico-mechanical process of filtration and
affect or destroy it, and this factor can be found only in the protoplasm, the vital element
of the cells; for we know that the sublimate acts with pernicious effect on it and in such
a manner that it destroys its entire power of reaction; it kills it, as we say.

The experiment under discussion has, therefore, great significance for our view of the vital
processes in the plant; it proves beyond doubt that these processes are in no way of a purely
mechanical nature, but that there is something underlying all this, a hitherto inexplicable
something, which we call "life." In all vital activities, physical and chemical processes certainly
do occur; they do not, however, take place spontaneously but are made use of by the vital element
of the plant to produce an effect that is desirable or necessary for the vital activity of
the plant. If the vital element is dead, no matter how favorable the conditions may be for
chemical and physical processes, these do not take place and the effect necessary for life
is not obtained. It is very remarkable after all that according to the experiment of Haberlandt
this peculiar relation should become apparent in a process that is so open to our investigation
as the filtration of water through the cell-wall of a plant.

After what has been said I consider this simple experiment of Haberlandt of great significance;
for it is a direct proof of the existence of a vital force. One may resist to his heart's content,
but without avail; vital force is again finding its way into science. More and more cognizance
is being taken of the fact that 60 and 70 years ago people jumped at conclusions very imprudently
when they believed that the first artificial preparation of organic matter (urea, by Woehler)
had proven the non-existence of a vital force. But that i shall be helpfully worthless were a

 For, while the latter vigorously attacks the transmission of acquired characters,
Eimer's whole theory is founded on this very transmission. Observations regarding the coloring
of animals, in fact, form the basis of Eimer's theory.

Eimer attributes the origin of species to "organic growth" by which he means not merely increase
in size, but also change of form, etc. This growth does not proceed blindly or aimlessly, but
proceeds on rigidly determined lines, which depend upon the structure and constitution of the
particular organism. External influences, however, also affect it. Eimer specially emphasizes
four points in this connection: 1. This rigidly determined development of a character exhibits
well defined, regular stages, and the evolution of each individual repeats the whole series
of transformations (the Mueller-Haeckel "biogenetic-law.") 2. New characters are first acquired
by strong adult males (the law of male dominance). 3. New characters appear on definite parts
of the body, spreading especially from the rear to the front, (the law of undulation). 4. Varieties
are stages in the process of development, through which all the individuals of the respective
species must pass.

These points indicate how important for Eimer is the transmission of those characters which
the parents themselves have acquired in the course of their own development. He conceives that
this transmission takes place when the causative influences exert themselves permanently on
many succeeding generations. Eimer thinks that in this way the constitution of the respective
species is gradually transformed. Besides the effect of external influences (which may vary
according to the climate, etc.: Geoffroy St. Hilaire), Eimer mentions as important and active
factors in this development, (1). The use and disuse of organs (Lamarck); (2). The struggle
for existence (Darwin); (3). The correlation of organs, that is, the inner relation of organs
in consequence of which a change in one organ may occasion a sudden change in another organ;
(4). Cross fertilization and hybridism.

It is clear that with reference to the factors of evolution Eimer is, and perhaps not unreasonably,
an eclectic, whose aim is to do justice to the predecessors of Darwin as well as to Darwin
himself. His antagonism to Darwin and Weismann in this work is still quite moderate, although
even here it appears with sufficient clearness that selection and the struggle for existence,
the two principles peculiarly characteristic of Darwinism, do not give rise to new species,
but can at best only separate and differentiate species already existing.

The second part of Eimer's work dealing with the origin of species, which appeared after an
interval of ten years, bears the title: "Orthogenesis of Butterflies." The Origin of Species,
II. Part (2 tables and 235 illustrations in the text). Leipzig, 1897. In this book substantially
the same thoughts occupy the mind of the author as in the former volume, but in many respects
they are more mature, and conspicuously more definite and precise. The most salient features
are the following:

1. Eimer establishes his theory by means of very minute observations on a definite species
of animals, viz., butterflies.

2. He attributes evolution almost exclusively to development along definitely determined lines.

3. He proves the utter untenableness of Darwinian principles and repudiates them unqualifiedly.

4. In a very distinct and severe manner he gives expression to his opposition to his former
friend Weismann.

5. He attacks with telling effect the fantastic Darwinian "Mimicry."

In his "General Introduction" Eimer first treats of Orthogenesis in opposition to the Darwinian
theory of selection. The very first sentence gives evidence of this antagonism: "According
to my investigation, organic growth (Organophysis), which is rendered dependent on the plasm
by permanent external influences, climate and nourishment, and the expression of which is found
in development along definitely determined lines, (Orthogenesis), is the principal cause of
transformation, its occasional interruption and its temporary cessation and is likewise the
principal cause of the division of the series of organisms into species."

Lamarck's theory of the use and disuse of organs and Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection
are consequently pushed into the background. Here also Eimer at once places himself at variance
with Naegeli who had enunciated a similar theory. Naegeli took as a starting point an inherent
tendency in every being to perfect itself, thus presupposing an "inner principle of development,"
and making light of external influences as transforming causes. Eimer flatly contradicts this
view. We shall revert to this point in our criticism of his theory. In opposition to the theory
of selection, Eimer lays special stress on the fact that its underlying assumption, viz., fortuitous,
indefinite variation in many different directions, is entirely devoid of foundation in fact,
and that selection, in order to be effective, postulates the previous existence of the required
useful characters, whereas the very point at issue is to explain how these characters have
originated. Since, therefore, according to Eimer's investigations, there are everywhere to
be found only a few, definitely determined lines of variation, selection is incapable of exercising
any choice. The development, furthermore, proceeds without regard for utility, since, for instance,
the features that characterize a species of plants are out of all reference to utility. "Even
if nothing exists that is essentially detrimental, nevertheless very much does exist that bears
no reference whatever to immediate good, and was therefore never affected by selection."

Further on, Eimer expresses still more clearly the opposition of his theory to that of Darwin,
and in so doing he attacks vigorously the omnipotence of selection, so unreasonably proclaimed
by the followers of Darwin. Eimer's theory, consequently, asserts that: "The essential cause
of transmutation is organic growth, a definite variation, which, during long periods of time
proceeds unswervingly and without reference to utility, in but few directions and is conditioned
by the action of external influences, of climate and nourishment." In consequence of an interruption
of orthogenesis a stoppage ensues in certain stages of the development, and this stoppage is
the great cause of the arrangement of forms in different species. Of vital importance also
"is development through different stages (Hetero-epistase), which results in the arrested development
of certain characters in an organism, while others progress and still others become retrogressive.
As a rule use and disuse are of great efficacy in this regard, and conjointly with these compensation
and correlation." Occasionally also irregular development sets in, which proceeds by leaps.

Of course, Eimer could not but in his turn burn incense before Darwin by declaring that he
would not dare to cross swords with such a man, while in reality he repudiates all of Darwin's
fundamental tenets.

It may be well to state here in addition a few important supplementary considerations: "Development
can everywhere proceed in only a limited number of directions because the constitution, the
material composition of the body, conditions these directions and prevents variation in all
directions." This is an important statement because Eimer clearly expresses therein the difference
between his own theory and that of Naegeli. He makes the direction of development dependent
on the material composition of the body, whereas Naegeli considers it dependent upon an internal
tendency of every being to perfect itself, hence upon a power inherent in the body. Eimer's
view therefore tends towards a mechanical explanation, while Naegeli postulates a vital energy.
The "internal causes" according to Eimer find their explanation in the material composition
of the body. Since the growth of the individual organism depends on this composition and on
the external influences, Eimer compares family-development with it and designates the latter
as "organic growth." In opposition to Naegeli he maintains that this "organic growth" does
not always aim at perfection but often tends to simplification and retrogression.

The following, then, according to Eimer, are the directive principles of variation: (1). The
general law of coloration (stripes running lengthwise change into spots, stripes running crosswise
change to a uniform color). (2). The law of definitely directed local change (new colors spread
from the rear to the front and from above downward or vice versa, old colors disappear in the
same directions.) (3). The law of male predominance (males are as a rule one step in advance
of the females in development). Female predominance is an exception. (4). The law of age-predominance
(new characters appear at a well-advanced age, and at the time of greatest strength). (5).
The law of wave-like development (during the course of the formation of the individual organism
a series of changes proceed in a definite direction over the body of the animals). (6). The
law of independent uniformity of development (the same course of development is pursued in
non-related forms and results in similar forms). List'the swords in course of which they burn to
dare you, or are observe of you. Complicatedness directions thus listed. 2. Class he dare a

considerations.

3. Class he proceed the problems upon variation according as they are not local, and private
directions. 4. Database and political-state difficulty thus classified.
What fda, fundamental, turn-societal, or private, are not studying
it is with problems in constitution?

5.
 The law of the cessation
of development (a protracted cessation of development frequently ensues in one or the other stage).

The origin (perhaps rather the distinction) of species is accounted for principally by the
last named law, by means of which Eimer also explains the so-called atavism or reversion. To
this law are joined other factors, e.g., development proceeding in leaps, as demonstrated by
Koelliker and Heer; local separation (through migration; prevention of fertilization, e.g.,
the impossibility of cross-fertilization between certain individual organisms) which Romanes
had already opposed to natural selection, and crossing.

The second main division of the book is taken up with a very searching and detailed criticism
of Weismann. This criticism seems to me entirely warranted; because not only the latter's unintelligible
position with regard to natural selection (the repudiation of which he seems to regard as synonymous
"with cessation of all investigation into the causal nexus of phenomena in the domain of life")
but likewise his fanciful theory of heredity, utterly devoid as it is of any support from actual
observation, bespeak an utter lack of qualities essential to a naturalist; and the manner in
which he ignores his former pupil and his labors, because they proved embarrassing to him,
is entirely unworthy of a man of science.

Eimer devotes special attention to "mimicry"; and indeed he was forced to be very solicitous
to dispel this fanciful conception of Darwinism which radically contradicted his own views.
Moreover, the untenableness of the mimicry hypothesis must have revealed itself very clearly
to him in the course of his investigations regarding the coloring of butterflies. Mimicry,
as our readers are well aware, consists in this, that living beings imitate other organisms
or even inanimate objects; Darwinism maintains that this is done for the sake of protection
against enemies. This phenomenon is said to have been produced by selection. Those animals
that possessed, for instance, some similarity to a leaf, in consequence escaped their enemies
more easily than others and survived, while those that had no leaf-like appearance succumbed;
when this process had been repeated a few times, many animals (butterflies) gradually developed
that marvelous leaf-like appearance, which frequently deceives the most practiced eye.

It appears so simple and natural that one need not wonder that this peculiar phenomenon gained
many an adherent for Darwinism. But, of course, it is directly opposed to the views of Eimer;
and it is for this reason that he endeavors so assiduously to disprove the error of Darwinism
in this regard. As the underlying color design of the butterfly Eimer designates eleven longitudinal
designs; and the examination of the leaf-like forms leads him to the conclusion, that their
appearance always depends on "the unaltered condition or the greater prominence of certain
parts of this fundamental design." There is to be observed a shifting of the third band, so
that in conjunction with the fourth, which is curved, it forms the mid-rib of the leaf. Eimer
finds the cause of this phenomenon in the alteration of the form. The leaf-like form results
from an acumination and elongation of the wings, which in turn results from a marked elongation
of the rim of the fore-wing. And this again is produced by the proportionately greater growth
of one part of the wing-section than of the others.

With reference to the reason of this growth it is of importance to note that experiments, consisting
in the application of artificial heat to the chrysales of the swallow-tail and sailor-butterfly,
demonstrated that by this means "the fore-wing is drawn out more toward the outer wing-vein,
and the rim of the fore-wing becomes more elongated and curved." It is observed, however, that
the natural heat-forms of the same genera and species, namely, the summer-forms and those which
live in the warm southern climate, exhibit, for instance, in the case of butterflies akin to
the sailor, the same features, the elongation and more marked curvature of the fore-rim of
the fore-wings and the consequent more extended form, that are produced by the action of artificial
heat. Manifestly this is a matter of vital importance for the solution of the question: heat,
whether artificial or natural, produces a difference in growth, which results in a change of
form and coloring. He mention it. (Schmidt, science, press. Bonn, weltraetsel, professor. Marshal,

That Eimer does not take this step, is, to my mind, a mistake, which must be attributed to
his one-sidedness, which, in turn, results from the fact that he generalizes too arbitrarily
his observations on butterflies and the conclusions which he draws from them. Animals and plants
certainly possess many characteristics which cannot be explained by means of his theory alone.
The conclusion will probably be finally arrived at, that nature is inexhaustible and many-sided,
even in the lines on which it proceeds to attain this or that end.

One thing, however, of primary importance is evident from the investigations of Eimer, namely
the proof that the same lines of development may be entered upon from entirely different starting-points,
and that the number of these lines is limited. This fact is of importance because it enjoins
more caution in arguing from uniformity of development to family-relation, than has been usually
employed since the days of Darwin. The method commonly employed is undoubtedly very convenient,
but is somewhat liable to be misleading. Hence, if one wishes to establish the genealogical
relationship of forms, nothing remains but to set out on the laborious path of studying the
development of both; and even then it remains questionable whether the truth will be arrived
at. However, he who concludes to relationship from a comparison of developed forms, is much
less likely to arrive at the truth.

In one point Eimer concedes too much to Darwinism, in the matter of the famous fundamental
principle of biogenesis, according to which an organism is said to repeat in its individual
development the whole series of its progenitors. Although he does not enter upon a discussion
of the principle, it is evident from one passage that he accepts it. One is inclined to think
that his careful observations and experiments should have convinced him of the contrary. It
appears to me, at least, that the abundant materials of his observations bear evidence radically
opposed to the principle. During late years, the antagonism to it has been on the increase,
and the day is not very distant when it shall have passed into history. It would certainly
be a laudable undertaking to enter upon a thorough investigation of the actual basis of the
principle.

CHAPTER VI.

In every disease, especially in a lingering one, there are times when life's flickering embers
glow with an unnatural brightness. Hence, it would not be a all surprising if a similar phenomenon
were to be observed in the case of dying Darwinism; for it cannot be doubted that its disease
is chronic. It has, in fact, been dying this long time. Certain indications render it very
probable that we are at present witnessing such a phenomenon, for to-day we behold once more
a few naturalists stepping before the public in defense of Darwinism. Principle point-nonsense, be required

Anyone can readily point out that Darwinism explains the totality of the world of organisms
by interlinking them, but has generally failed to account for the individual case, Wagner admits
this as far as the "actual" is concerned, for it is quite impossible to trace with any certainty
the action, in any particular case, of natural selection in the process which results in the
production of a new species. At the outset it was reasonable to hope, that with the progress
of science this difficulty would be solved or at least lessened; but this expectation has not
been realized. * * * It is wholly unintelligible how a naturalist can make this statement five
hundred years after Bacon of Verulam, without drawing therefrom the proper conclusion. This
lack of logic reminds me strongly of the assertion recently made by an eminent authority, that
the principal cause of the difficulties of many naturalists in matters of religion is their
deficient philosophical training.

Wagner's statement implies that, in the case of Darwinism one may in defiance of all established
law, actually reverse the methods of natural science. How justifiable and how necessary was
it not, then, that even three decades ago Wigand should have written his comprehensive work:
"Darwinism and the Scientific Researches of Newton and Cuvier."

How then fares it with the anthropological basis of Haeckel's whole system? As an attentive
student of his age the naturalist-philosopher of Jena must have perceived the true position
of Darwinism, namely, that the foremost naturalists of to-day have no more than an historical
interest in it. Since, in accordance with the well known tendency of old men to persevere in
the position they have once assumed and not easily to accept innovations, Haeckel is still
an incorrigibly orthodox Darwinian, we should naturally expect him to embody in this testament
some new cogent evidence of the truth of Darwinism. But nothing of that nature is to be found
in the book.

The first chapter of the "Anthropological part" is taken up with a "general history of nineteenth
century culture," in itself a sign of peculiar logical acumen, that he should include this
and the "struggle regarding world-views" in the "anthropological part" instead of embodying
it in a general introduction. The remaining chapters treat: "Our Bodily Structure," "Our Life,"
"Our Embryonic-history," "Our Family-history." It is not to be supposed, however, that any
arguments are here adduced, nothing but assertions; a large part of the chapter is taken up
with historical sketches, in which Haeckel again proves himself utterly devoid of all appreciation
of history and all sense of justice. He attributes the decay of the natural sciences to the
"flourishing condition of Christianity" and dares to speak of the unfavorable influence of
Christianity on civilization. Apart from the historical sketch, each chapter presents only
the quintessence of Darwinism, fairly bristling with assertions, which are boldly put forth
as incontrovertible truths. In view of the author's demand to have at least his sincere love
of truth recognized, we can but throw up our hands out of sheer astonishment. To illustrate
Haeckel's "love of truth" let it suffice to observe that in the second chapter he asserts that
man is not only a true vertebrate, a true mammal, etc.--which indeed is passable--but even
a true ape (having "all the anatomical characteristics of true apes"). With a wonderful elasticity
he passes over the differences. What, indeed, is to be said, when he states as a "fact" that
"physiologically compared (!), the sound-speech of apes is the preparatory stage to articulate
human speech." It is so simply monstrous, that even Garner's famous book of ape-speech, cannot
surpass it. As a third illustration of Haeckel's method of argumentation, if we are still justified
in speaking of such a thing, we may mention his assertion (p. 97) as a "certain historical
fact," "That man is descended directly from the ape, and indirectly from a long line of lower
vertebrates." If, in view of the results of research during the last forty years any one can
assert this as a "certain historical fact" and can still wish to be credited with honest conviction
and love of truth, there remains, to adopt Haeckel's own expression, but one explanation for
this psychological enigma, namely, intellectual marasmus senilis, which may very easily have
set in with a man of sixty-six, who himself complains (p. 7) of "divers warnings of approaching
age."

Thus, the anthropological part of the "Weltraetsel" contains nothing new; always the same old
story, the same threadbare assertions without a shred of evidence to corroborate them.

The remaining parts also contain various scientific assertions, which are proposed as facts
without being such, but these parts do not immediately pertain to our theme. Suffice it to
say that, after reading Haeckel's "Weltraetsel," one would be led to think that there is no
question of a "deathbed of Darwinism," but that on the contrary Darwinism, as remodeled by
Haeckel, is more in the ascendant to-day than ever. Let us judge of its prestige by the reception
accorded the "Weltraetsel."

One unaltered edition after the other, thousand after thousand, the book is given to the public.
Hence it must meet with approval. It does indeed meet with approval, but the question is, from
whom? Immature college and university students will doubtless receive it with reverential awe,
just as they received the "Natural History of Creation" twenty-five years ago. Bebel accepts
the book as an infallible source of truth, and after him the social democrats and free-church
members will add it to the list of their "body and stomach books," which alone will afford
it a respectable clientele, at least in number. In no one of my "deathbed articles," however,
have I as yet ever maintained that Darwinism was decadent in these circles. I know full well,
that Darwinism has filtered down into that sphere and there satisfies the anti-Christian and
anti-religious demands of thousands.

Nothing, however, really depends on these senseless blind adherents of Haeckel's unproved assertions.
We are now intent upon investigating how the world of eminent thinkers and natural science
regards the latest product of Haeckel's fancy. That alone is of importance in ascertaining
the real status of Darwinism.

As regards, in the first place, the other parts of the book, it is well known that all of them
were vigorously attacked. Loofs in particular exposed Haeckel's theology, according to its
deserts, in the clear light of truth, and convicted Haeckel of "ignorance" and "dishonesty;"
while the philosopher Paulsen made short work of the "Weltraetsel" from his own standpoint,
("if a book could drip with superficiality, I should predicate that of the 19th chapter").
Harnack also condemned the theological section in the "Christliche Welt," and Troeltsch, Hoenigswald,
and Hohlfeld took Haeckel severely to task on philosophic grounds. The naturalists have thus
far maintained silence.

Scientific journals, and, I believe, only the more popular ones, pass a varying judgment on
the book according to the intellectual bent of their book reviewers; but no one of the eminent
and leading naturalists has publicly expressed his opinion regarding it. They all maintain
a very significant silence, which speaks for itself. Now, however, just at the proper time
a book, Die Descendenz-theorie has appeared from the pen of the zoologist, Professor Fleischmann
of Erlangen, in which Haeckel is severely condemned. (See Chapter IX.)

The press-notices of the Weltraetsel, which are quoted in the book will be considered presently.
It appears that with reference to natural science, only "laymen" discuss the book and approve
of Haeckel's views. This is a point of great importance since it proves satisfactorily that
men of science will have nothing to do with the "Weltraetsel." The large number of replies
would, however, not allow Haeckel's friends to remain silent. The most extensive defense forthcoming
was a pamphlet published by a certain Heinrich Schmidt of Jena. It cannot be gathered from
his book (Der Kampf um die Weltraetsel, Bonn, E. Strauss 1900) to what profession the author
belongs, hence I am unable to judge whence he derives the right to treat Haeckel's opponents
in summary a manner. It is significant to note what class of men, according to Schmidt, received
the "Weltraetsel" with enthusiasm and joy. They are August Specht, the free-church editor of
"Menschentum" and of the "Freien Glocken," Julius Hart, Professor Keller-Zuerich, the philosopher
and "Neokantian" Professor Spitzer of Graz, the popular literateur W. Boelsche, W. Ule, and
a few unknown great men, Dr. Zimmer, Th. Pappstein, R. Steiner, A. Haese; but stay, I came
very near forgetting the great pillar, Dodel of Zuerich. But where is there mention of the
professional colleagues of Haeckel whose testimonies could be taken seriously? Under the heading
"Literary Humbug," which evidently has reference to the contents of his own work, Schmidt then
meets numerous objections. Here vigorous epithets are bandied about, as, for instance, "absolute
nonsense," "muddler," "foolish and senseless prattle," "idle talk," etc.; and from Dodel he
copies the words with which the latter once sought to annihilate me: Job, verse 10, "Thou hast
spoken like one of the foolish women." And he ventures to express indignation at Loofs' "invectives." Eubacteria.

     Unfortunately he does not add that since then a number
of new editions of the "Weltraetsel" have appeared, in which Haeckel could have explained himself
in an honorable manner. Schmidt has therefore not been successful in his attempt to clear up
this matter.

But how does he settle with Romanes? He says: "We are assured that the thoughts were written
down by the English naturalist George John Romanes"; and again: "The thoughts are published
by a Canon of Westminster, Charles Gore, to whom they are said to have been handed over after
the death of Romanes in the year 1894." Then he has the audacity to place Romanes in quotation
marks. And finally he asserts that they would abide by Romanes' former works as their authority,
the more so, because these were not, like the "Thoughts," "published and glossed by a Canon
only after his (Romanes') death." By means of all this and of a comparison with the "Letters
of the Obscurantists" he wishes to create the suspicion that there might be question here of
forgery. Such an insinuation, (I employ Schmidt's own words) "cannot be characterized otherwise
than as contemptible." "Here it is even worse than contemptible." I must beg my reader's pardon
for overstepping the bounds of reserve with these caustic words, although they originated with
Schmidt; but really the flush of anger rightfully mounts to one's cheeks when a man, from the
mere fact that he is a disciple of the "great" Haeckel assumes the right to charge Canon Gore
and indirectly myself with forgery. It is really very significant that these men should have
to resort to such base and despicable expedients to extricate themselves from their unpleasant
predicament. Apart from this, it was very amusing to me personally to think that for the sake
of my unworthy self, Schmidt should have borrowed from his lord and master the epithet "pious,"
which Haeckel in his turn has drawn from his cherished friend Dodel. In all probability they
will continue to hawk it about in order to bring me into disrepute with the rest of their kind.
The few remarks Schmidt still finds it proper to make regarding the "Thoughts," betray his
inability to understand the book. But as I stated in the preface it was a difficult book to
read and understand. It is obviously not reading matter for shallow minds. I refer Schmidt
to the biography of Romanes, published by his wife, (The Life and Letters of G. J. Romanes,
London, Longmans, Green & Co., 1898), where he will find Romanes' religious development described
by a well-informed hand. This development began as early as 1878, hence during the time of
his intimate friendship with Darwin. In this book on pages 372 and 378 Schmidt will also find
the words in which, before his death, Romanes begged that, if he were personally unable to
publish the "Thoughts," they should be given to his friend Canon Gore after his own death.
But why waste so many words on Mr. Schmidt, for since all these things must be doubly disagreeable
and painful to him and Haeckel, he will very probably resort without delay to personal insinuation
and accuse Mrs. Romanes of forgery.

To us, however, who thoroughly appreciate the situation, it is a matter of great moment that
of one of the few really eminent naturalists, to whom Haeckel thought to be able to lay full
and exclusive claim, for the last twenty years of his life should have been moving towards
the Christian faith in his eager search for truth and should die not a monist, but a convinced
Christian. Neither did he die an old man, to whom the adherents of monism would certainly have
the effrontery to impute feeble-mindedness, but at the early age of forty-six years. (Bryce, special,

 Haeckel finds his way out of the difficulty
by supplying hypothetical forms which no one has ever seen, but which his imagination has admirably
depicted as transitional forms. In so doing, however, he abandons the inductive method of natural
science.

It is impossible for us to treat at such length all the remaining sections of this important
book. We may mention in passing that Fleischmann examines the "roots of the mammal stock,"
and enters upon a detailed discussion of "the origin of lung-breathing vertebrates," the "real
phylo-genetic problem of the mollusks," and "the origin of the echinodermata." It is evident
that he boldly takes up the most important problems connected with the theory of Descent, and
does not confine himself to a one-sided discussion of individual points. As he did not fear
to examine thoroughly the famous, and as it hitherto appeared, invulnerable, "parade-horse,"
so neither does he hesitate to demolish the other reputed proof for the doctrine of Descent,
e.g., the fresh-water snail of Steinheim, the remains of which Hilzendorf and Neumayr examined
and were said to have arranged in lines of descent that "would actually stagger one." It is
important to call especial attention to this because the adversaries of the book ignore it.
He next shows up the so-called "fundamental principle of biogenesis" according to which organisms
are supposed to repeat during their individual development the forms of their progenitors (enunciated
by Fritz Mueller and Haeckel). Fleischmann points out the exceptions which Haeckel attributes
to "Cenogenesis," (that is to falsification) and shows the disagreement among contemporary
naturalists regarding this fundamental principle. Even Haeckel's friend and pupil, O. Hertwig
sounds the retreat.

The 15th chapter deals with the "Collapse of Haeckel's Doctrine," which is revealed in the
fact that "the practical possibility of ascertaining anything regarding the primitive history
of the animal kingdom is completely exhausted and the hope of so doing forever frustrated."
"Instead of scientists having been able from year to year to produce an increasing abundance
of proof for the correctness of the doctrine of Descent, the lack of proofs and the impossibility
of procuring evidence is to-day notorious." In the last chapter Fleischmann finally attempts
to prove on logical principles the untenableness of the evolutionary idea.

He starts from the fact that philosophers use the word development to designate a definite
sequence of ideas, i.e., in a logical order. "Metamorphosis, says Hegel, belongs to the Idea
as such since its variation alone is development. Rational speculation must get rid of such
nebulous concepts as the evolution of the more highly developed animal organisms from the less
developed, etc."

Naturalists use the word in a different sense. Instead of a sequence of grades of being they
posit a sequence of transformations; instead of a logical sequence of ideas they posit a transforming
and progressive development. Zoology constructs a system of specific and generic concepts,
"an animal kingdom with logical relations." Our concepts are derived from natural objects,
but in reality do not perfectly correspond to them. The phylogenetic school commits the capital
mistake of presenting a transformation which can be realized only in logical concepts, as an
actually occurring process, and of confounding an abstract operation with concrete fact. "The
logical transformation of the concept ape into the concept man is no genealogical process."
The mathematician may logically 'develop' the concept of a circle from that of a polygon, but
it by no means follows that the circle is phylo-genetically derived from the polygon.

Because the concept of species is variable, the species themselves, according to Darwin, should
be subject to a continual flux; whereas the real cause of the variability which he observed
lies in the discrepancy between objective facts and their logical tabulation, in the narrowness
of our concepts and in the lack of adequate means of expression. He thus makes natural objects
responsible for our logical limitations.

With regard to organisms the Descent-school confounded the purely logical signification of
the word "related" with that of blood or family affinity. But surely when they speak of the
relation of forms in the crystal systems, they do not refer to genetic connection. To-day this
interchange of concepts is so general that one needs to exercise great care if one would avoid it.

The theory which postulates the blood-relationship of individuals of the same species may be
correct, but it is utterly incapable of proof, and the same is true in a greater degree when
there is question of individuals of the same class but of different species. Since a direct
proof is impossible, an attempt was made to construct an indirect proof by a comparison of
bodily-organs. But in so doing the Descent theorizers had to relinquish scientific analysis
altogether.

In conclusion Fleischmann states that he does not mean to discard every hypothesis of Descent.
He simply gives warning against an over-estimation of the theory. In opposition to those who
esteem it as the highest achievement of science, he looks upon it as a necessary evil. Its
proper sphere is the laboratory of the man of science, and not the thronging market-place.

This observation and reflexion, joined with the fact that organisms form a progressive series
from the simple to the more complex, and with the observed phenomena of individual development,
lead me to regard the concept of Descent as admissible, and in a certain sense, even probable.
But I agree with Fleischmann in saying that this is a mere belief, and that all attempts to
give it a higher scientific value by inductive proof have signally failed.

My standpoint, moreover, requires me to admit the validity of the hypothesis of Descent as
an heuristic maxim of natural science. I believe that we shall be justified in the future,
as we were forty years ago, in directing our investigation in the direction of Descent, and
I do not consider such investigation so utterly hopeless as Fleischmann represents it. Not partially

Let us hope that these last wild convulsions are really the signs of approaching dissolution.

CHAPTER X.

In order to judge of the present status of Darwinism it is of primary importance to note the
position assumed by the few really eminent investigators, who as pupils of Haeckel still seem
to have remained true to him. Among these I reckon Oskar Hertwig, the well known Berlin anatomist.

As early as 1899 in an address at the University on, Die Lehre vom Organismus und ihre Beziehung
zur Sozialwissenschaft, Hertwig gave expression to views which are very little in harmony with
the doctrines proceeding from Jena, and which are also put forth in his manual, The Cell and
the Tissue. In that address we read (p. 8): "With the same right, with which, for the good
of scientific progress, an energetic protest has been raised against a certain mysticism which
attaches to the word Vitality, I beg to give warning against an opposite extreme which is but
too apt to lead to onesided and unreal, and hence also, ultimately to false notions of the
vital process, against an extreme which would see in the vital process nothing but a chemico-physical
and mechanical problem and thinks to arrive at true scientific knowledge only in so far as
it succeeds in tracing back phenomena to the movements of repelling and attracting atoms and
in subjecting them to mathematical calculation."

With right does the physicist Mach, with reference to such views and tendencies, speak of a
'mechanical mythology in opposition to the animistic mythology of the old religions' and considers
both as "improper and fantastic exaggerations based on a one-sided judgment." "My position
on the question just stated becomes apparent from the consideration that the living organism
is not only a complex of chemical materials and a bearer of physical forces, but also possesses
a special organization, a structure, by means of which it is very essentially differentiated
from the inorganic world, and in virtue of which it alone is designated as living."

Here, then, the distinction between living and non-living nature is clearly and definitely
expressed, and Hertwig expresses himself just as definitely when he says (p. 21): "Whereas,
but a few decades ago a scientific materialistic conception of the world issuing from a onesided,
unhistorical point of view, misjudged the significance of the historic religious and ethical
forces in the development of mankind, a change has become apparent in this regard."

To this gratifying testimony against materialism the distinguished naturalist added an equally
valuable testimony regarding Darwinism on the occasion of the naturalists' convention in 1900.
He there sketched an excellent summary of the "Development of Biology in the Nineteenth Century,"
in which he decidedly opposes the materialistic-mechanical conception of life. In so doing
he also touches upon Haeckel's carbon-hypothesis, to which the latter still clings, and says:
"That from the properties of carbon, combined with the properties of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
etc., in certain proportions albumen should result, is a process which in its essence is as
incomprehensible as that a living cell should arise from a certain organization of different
albumina." The Dr has hither had postdate much property in the forces should
have been supply.

can very feel the matter.

 Hertwig then is decidedly of opinion that Darwinism entirely
fails in the individual case because in its application the basis of experience vanishes. Indeed,
according to him, phylogeny is not at all capable of direct scientific investigation. Of a mansion
nothing now remains but of a ruins. It was destroyed by Peoples while. was however lief been fatal,

You will say those are all for steps. Also have cub can make many things with scroll, does
many pars in frames, brackets, and boxes, all young Thousandth.
 In short, this is not natural science but natural
philosophy; it forms no constituent part of our certain knowledge of nature but it is one aspect
of our world-view.

All the above-quoted assertions of Hertwig are calm and well-considered and show a decided
deviation from the Darwinian position. Above all we are pleased to note that he appropriates
Spencer's phrase regarding the "Impotence of Natural Selection" and that in the citation from
Huxley he at least admits the possibility that the Darwinian doctrine will be "wafted away."

It is also proper to mention here the fact that in another place Hertwig no longer recognizes
so fully the dogma set up by Fritz Mueller and Haeckel which is so closely bound up with Darwinism.
I mean the so-called "biogenetic principle" according to which the individual organism is supposed
to repeat in its development the development of the race during the course of ages.

THE BOOK OF THE DAY

Science and Christianity

By F. BETTEX

Translated from the German

The author among other things says in the preface: I wish to make clear to my readers how little
real science is hidden behind the fine phrases and sounding words or the infidel, and how little
he himself understands of the material creation which he affirms to be the only one.... The
Christian and Biblical conception of the universe is more logical, more harmonious, more in
accordance with facts, therefore, more scientific than all philosophies, all systems, materialistic
and atheistic. Contents of the book:

    Chapter   I. Progress
    Chapter  II. Evolution and Modern Science
    Chapter III. Christians and Science
    Chapter  IV. Science
    Chapter   V. Materialism

One of the many favorable reviews: It is a view of much scope, and so far as it attempts reconciliation
between science and christianity, is eminently successful. The traveller who is rising the region in June
will find consequent patches to snow'and ice of the cliffs, and there he may be fortunate enough
amongst see this artificial production exploring fresh and superb
beside its yosemite bed.
