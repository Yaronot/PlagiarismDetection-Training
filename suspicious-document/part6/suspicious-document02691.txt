The King wept a good deal.  He was pressed to dine with Madame de Maintenon; but he would not
do so, and had his dinner, as usual, with the ladies.  The tears often ran down his cheek,
during the meal, which was short.  After this, he shut himself up in Madame de Maintenon's
rooms until seven o'clock, and then took a turn in his garden.  Afterwards he worked with Chamillart
and Pontchartrain; and arranged all the funeral ceremonies of Monsieur.  He supped an hour
before his customary time, and went to bed soon afterwards.

At the departure from St. Cloud of the King, all the crowd assembled there little by little
withdrew, so that Monsieur dying, stretched upon a couch in his cabinet, remained exposed to
the scullions and the lower officers of the household, the majority of whom, either by affection
or interest, were much afflicted.  The chief officers and others who lost posts and pensions
filled the air with their cries; whilst all the women who were at Saint Cloud, and who lost
their consideration and their amusement, ran here and there, crying, with dishevelled hair,
like Bacchantes.  The Duchesse de la Ferme, who had basely married her daughter to one of Monsieur's
minions, named La Carte, came into the cabinet; and, whilst gazing on the Prince, who still
palpitated there, exclaimed, giving vent to her profound reflections, "Pardi!  Here is a daughter
well married!"

"A very important matter!" cried Chatillon, who himself lost everything by this death.  "Is
this a moment to consider whether your daughter is well married or not?"

Madame, who had never had great affection or great esteem for Monsieur, but who felt her loss
and her fall, meanwhile remained in her cabinet, and in the midst of her grief cried out, with
all her might, "No convent! Let no one talk of a convent!  I will have nothing to do with a
convent!" The good Princess had not lost her judgment.  She knew that, by her compact of marriage,

CHAPTER XXII

After such a frightful spectacle as had been witnessed, so many tears and so much tenderness,
nobody doubted that the three, days which remained of the stay at Marly would be exceedingly
sad.  But, on the very morrow of the day on which Monsieur died, some ladies of the palace,
upon entering the apartments of Madame de Maintenon, where was the King with the Duchesse de
Bourgogne, about twelve o'clock, heard her from the chamber where they were, next to hers,
singing opera tunes.  A little while after, the King, seeing the Duchesse de Bourgogne very
sad in a corner of the room, asked Madame de Maintenon, with surprise, why the said Duchess
was so melancholy; set himself to work to rouse her; then played with her and some ladies of
the palace he had called in to join in the sport. This was not all.  Before rising from the
dinner table, at a little after two o'clock, and twenty-six hours after the death of Monsieur,
Monseigneur the Duc de Bourgogne asked the Duc de Montfort if he would play at brelan.

"At brelan!" cried Montfort, in extreme astonishment; "you cannot mean it!  Monsieur is still
warm."

"Pardon me," replied the Prince, "I do mean it though.  The King does not wish that we should
be dull here at Marly, and has ordered me to make everybody play; and, for fear that nobody
should dare to begin, to set, myself, the example;" and with this he began to play at brelan;
and the salon was soon filled with gaming tables.

Such was the affection of the King: such that of Madame de Maintenon! She felt the loss of
Monsieur as a deliverance, and could scarcely restrain her joy; and it was with the greatest
difficulty she succeeded in putting on a mournful countenance.  She saw that the King was already
consoled; nothing could therefore be more becoming than for her to divert him, and nothing
suited her better than to bring things back into their usual course, so that there might be
no more talk of Monsieur nor of affliction.  For propriety of appearance she cared nothing.
The thing could not fail, however, to be scandalous; and in whispers was found so. Monseigneur,
though he had appeared to like Monsieur, who had given him all sorts of balls and amusements,
and shown him every kind of attention and complaisance, went out wolf hunting the very day
after his death; and, upon his return, finding play going on in the salons, went without hesitation
and played himself like the rest.  Monseigneur le Duc de Bourgogne and M. le Duc de Berry only
saw Monsieur on public occasions, and therefore could not be much moved by his loss.  But Madame
la Duchesse was extremely touched by this event.  He was her grandfather; and she tenderly
loved her mother, who loved Monsieur; and Monsieur had always been very kind to her, and provided
all kinds of diversion for her.  Although not very loving to anybody, she loved Monsieur; and
was much affected not to dare to show her grief, which she indulged a long time in private.
What the grief of Madame was has already been seen.

As for M. de Chartres, he was much affected by his loss.  The father and son loved each other
extremely.  Monsieur was a gentle and indulgent parent, who had never constrained his son.
But if the Duke's heart was touched, his reason also was.  Besides the great assistance it
was to him to have a father, brother of the King, that father was, as it were, a barrier between
him and the King, under whose hand he now found himself directly placed.  His greatness, his
consideration, the comfort of his house and his life, would, therefore, depend on him alone. Two

  She was charmed to be quit of the duty of following Monsieur to Paris or Saint Cloud,
where she found herself, as it were, in a foreign country, with faces which she never saw anywhere
else, which did not make her welcome; and where she was exposed to the contempt and humour
of Madame, who little spared her.  She expected for the future never to leave the Court, and
to be not only exempt from paying her court to Monsieur, but that Madame and her husband would
for the future be obliged to treat her in quite another manner.
