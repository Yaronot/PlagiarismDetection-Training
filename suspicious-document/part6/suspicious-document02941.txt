Betty Trevor

by Mrs George de Horne Vaizey (aka Jessie Mansergh)

This book concerns a family where the children consist of a couple of boys, and a few more
than that of girls.  They live in a Square in London, which bears the name of an existing London
Square, but which is placed, according to the story, in quite a different place to the real
one.  The children are fascinated by the occupants of the various other houses, some of whom
they gradually get to know.

The children grow up, the boys are away doing interesting things, and the girls become interested
in their own clothes and appearances.  This may be just a male's view of the story, but it
seems like it to me, for there doesn't seem to be nearly as much life as you find in the same
author's Pixie books.  Well, I suppose that's not true: there is a subtle undercurrent of old
love affairs revived that runs right to the very last page--and that is one of Mrs Vaizey's
greatest skills.  If you haven't done so, do read the little biography we have written of her,
as it will help you to understand her writing rather better than if you don't.

Still, you read the book, and see what you think.  You may well be pleasantly surprised.

THE "PAMPERED PET."

"There goes the `Pampered Pet' again!  Got its little keeper with it, as usual.  Why don't
they lead her by a chain, and be done with it?"

Miles stood by the schoolroom window, hands jingling in pockets, as he surveyed a prospect,
sufficiently grey and drear to make any diversity doubly welcome, and at his words there came
the sound of a general pushing-back of chairs, as the four other occupants of the room dashed
forward to share in the view.

They jostled each other with the scant courtesy which brothers and sisters are apt to show
each other in early days; five big boys and girls, ranging between the ages of eight and nineteen.
Miles kept his central position by reason of superior strength, a vigorous dig of his pointed
elbow being enough to keep trespassers at a distance.  Betty darted before him and nimbly dropped
on her knees, the twins stood on either side of the window-sill, while poor Pam grumbled and
fretted in the background, dodging here and there to try all positions in turn, and finding
each as unsatisfactory as the last.

The Square gardens looked grey and sodden with the desolation of autumn in a city, and the
road facing the window was empty, except for two female figures--a lady, and a girl of sixteen,
who were slowly approaching the corner.  The lady was dressed in black, the girl was noticeably
smart, in a pretty blue costume, with dainty boots on her tiny feet, and a fur cap worn at
the fashionable angle on her golden head.

"That's a new dress,--the fifth I've seen her in this month!" sighed Betty enviously.  "Wearing
it on an afternoon like this, too.  The idea! Serve her right if it were soaked through!"

"Look at her mincing over the puddles!  She'd rather go a mile out of her way than get a splash
on those precious boots.  I'm sure by the look of them that they pinch her toes!  I am glad
you girls don't make ninnies of yourselves by wearing such stupid things."

"Can't!  Feet too big!" mumbled Jill, each cheek bulging in turn with the lump of toffee which
she was mechanically moving from side to side, so as to lengthen the enjoyment as much as possible.

"Can't!  Too poor!  Only four shillings to last out till the end of the quarter!" sighed Betty,
dolorous again.

"Boots!  Boots!  What boots?  Let me see her boots.  It's mean!  You won't let me see a thing!"
cried Pam, pushing her shaggy head round Miles' elbow, and craning forward on the tip of her
toes.  "I say! She's grander than ever to-day, isn't she?"

"Look at the umbrella!  About as thick as a lead pencil!" scoffed Jill, flattening her nose
against the pane.  "Aunt Amy had one like that when she came to stay, and I opened it, because
mother says it spoils them to be left squeezed up, and she was as mad as a hatter.  She twisted
at it a good ten minutes before she would take it out again.  She'd never get mine straight!
I've carried things in it till the wires bulge out like hoops.  An umbrella is made for use;
it's bosh pretending it's an ornament. ...  They are going a toddle round the Square between
the showers for the benefit of the Pet's complexion.  I'm glad I haven't got one to bother about!"

"True for you!" agreed Miles, with brotherly candour.  "You are as brown as a nigger, and the
Pet is like a big wax-doll--yellow hair, blue eyes, pink cheeks, all complete.  Not a bad-looking
doll, either.  I passed quite close to her one day, and she looked rattling.  She'll be a jolly
pretty girl one of these days."

"Oh, if you admire that type.  Personally, I don't care for niminy- piminies.  You never see
her speaking, but I daresay if you poked her in the right places she would bleat out `Mam-ma!
Pa-pa!' ...  Now watch!" cried Betty dramatically.  "When she gets to the corner, she will
peer up at this window beneath her eyelashes, and mince worse than ever when she sees us watching.
Don't shove so, Pam!  You can see quite well where you are.  Now look!  She's going to raise
her head."

The five heads pressed still more curiously against the pane, and five pairs of eyes were fixed
unblinkingly upon the young girl who was daintily picking her way round the corner of the Square.
The fur cap left her face fully exposed to view, and, true to Betty's prophecy, as she reached
a certain point in the road she turned her head over her shoulder and shot a quick glance at
the window overhead.  Quicker than lightning the pretty head went round again, and the pink
cheeks grew crimson at the sight of those five eager faces watching her every movement.

Jack and Jill burst into loud laughter, Betty's upper lip curled derisively, but Miles' thin
face showed an answering flush of colour, and he backed into the room, exclaiming angrily--

"I say, this is too much of a good thing!  I don't know what you all mean by swarming round
me wherever I go!  Why can't you leave a fellow alone?  Can't I even look out of the window
without having you all on my back?  A nice effect it must have to see the whole place blocked
up, as if we were staring at a Lord Mayor's show!"

Betty sat down by the table and took up the blouse on which she had been working for the last
three months.  The sleeves had been taken out and replaced twice over, and the collar-band
obstinately refused to come right.  By the time it was finished it would be hopelessly out
of date, which Betty considered as one of the many contrary circumstances of life which continually
thwarted her good endeavours.

"Don't worry yourself.  She will enjoy being stared at!" she said coldly.  "She knows we watch
her coming in and out, and shows off all her little tricks for our benefit.  She's the most
conceited, stuck-up, affected little wretch I ever saw, without a thought in her head but her
clothes, and her own importance.  I wouldn't have anything to do with her for the world!"

"Jolly good thing then that you are never likely to get a chance!  Her people will never trouble
to call upon us; they are much too high and mighty.  That's no reason, though, why you should
be so down on the poor little soul.  I should have thought that you would have felt sorry for
her, cooped up with that old governess all her time, with not a soul to keep her company! 
But girls are such cads--they never play fair."

Miles strode out of the room in a fume, and Betty's lips compressed themselves into a thin
straight line, the meaning of which the others knew full well.  To incur Miles' displeasure
was Betty's bitterest punishment, and the "Pampered Pet" was not likely to fare any better
at her hands in consequence of his denouncement.  Jill beckoned furtively to Jack.  There was
no chance of any more fun in the schoolroom now that Miles had departed, and Betty was in the
sulks; it would be wise to go and disport themselves elsewhere.  They left the room arm-in-arm,
heads almost touching, as they whispered and giggled together, the most devoted pair of twins
that ever existed, and eight-year-old Pam leant her elbows on the table and stared fixedly
at her big sister.

Betty was seventeen, nearly grown-up, inasmuch as she had left school, and now took classes
to complete her education.  Her blue serge dress came down to her ankles, and she made a gallant
attempt to "do up" her hair in the style of the period.  Mrs Trevor considered the style too
elaborate for such a young girl, but after all it did not much matter what was aimed at, since
every morning someone exclaimed innocently, "You've done your hair a new way, Betty!" and was
fully justified in the remark.  One day Betty's ambition ran to curls and waves, and she appeared
at the breakfast-table with a fuzz worthy of a negress.  The next day better judgment prevailed,
when she brushed hard for ten minutes, and then pinned on a hair-net, with the result that
she looked a veritable little Puritan; and between these extremes ranged a variety of effects,
only possible of achievement to an amateur with no experience, but boundless ambition.

  He was rather sorry now that he had mentioned his easy victory over the redoubtable
Johnston.  The pater would expect him to be top every day, whereas he had only just put on
a spurt to show what he could do if he chose.  Suppose he did lose the scholarship, it wouldn't
be so bad after all, he could still play footer on Saturday afternoons!

The doctor's glance had wandered, as if for consolation, to his elder son--Miles the strenuous,
the indefatigable, who had a passion for work for work's sake.  He was going through the practical
stage of an engineer's training, and left the house at six o'clock each morning, to return
in the afternoon clad in workman's clothes, incredibly greasy and dirty.  Betty suffered agonies
in case "they"--that wonderful impersonal "they" who overclouded her life--should think he
was really and truly an ordinary workman!  On one occasion Miles had joined her on the doorstep
as she was returning from an afternoon walk, and she had distinctly seen the curtains of the
Pampered Pet's drawing-room move, as if someone were peeping out from behind, when, as she
confided to Jill later on, "her cheeks turned k-r-rimson with mortification!"

"Well, Miles, my boy, did you take your little invention with you to- day, and were you able
to show it to the manager?"

"Yes, I took it all right."

"And what did he say?"

"He said it was all right."

"Does that mean that he acknowledged that it was an improvement on the present method?  Did
he feel inclined to give it a trial?"

"Oh yes, it went all right.  He said it would do."

"But that's capital!  Capital!  I congratulate you heartily!  Didn't Mr Davidson seem pleased
that you should have hit on such a bright idea?"

"Oh, he said it was all right."

Miles made a determined attack on his plate, as if pleading to be left alone to enjoy his dinner
in peace.  Since the days of his babyhood he had shown a strong inventive genius, and now it
was his delight to spend his spare moments working in his little cupboard sanctum at home,
striving to improve on any bit of machinery which struck him as falling short of perfection.
It was a very simple thing which he had attempted, but in machinery, as in many other things,
trifles are all-important, and it was a triumph indeed that a lad of nineteen should have hit
on an improvement which was considered worth a trial.

Dr Trevor and his wife exchanged smiles of happy satisfaction.  They yearned to ask a dozen
more questions, but refrained out of sympathy with that natural masculine reserve which they
understood so well. Betty, however, was less considerate.

"I do think you might tell us a little more about it, Miles!" she cried resentfully.  "You
know we are all dying of curiosity.  I can't think why it is that boys can never give a decent
account of anything that has happened!  Now, if it had been me, I should have begun at the
very beginning, from the moment I entered the works, and told you how I felt as I went upstairs,
and how I began to speak to the manager, and what he said, and how he looked, and--"

"What colour of necktie he wore--"

Betty tossed her head in scornful contempt of the burst of laughter evoked by Miles' words.

"And what he did with the screw, or whatever you call it, when you showed it to him, and what
the other men said, and-- Oh, dozens of interesting things; but you can say nothing but `all
right' to every single question.  It is dull!"

"You must allow for diversities of talent, Betty," said Mrs Trevor, laughing.  "We do not all
possess your powers of description.  Miles is very modest over his success, and I, like you,
want to hear more details.  You must be sure to tell us how the trial works, Son; and if your
improvement is permanently adopted, I shall be proud!"

"Nothing to be proud of!" muttered Miles into his plate.

If there was one thing he loathed more than another, it was to be praised and petted, and made
the centre of attention.  His roughened fingers clenched themselves tightly round the knife
and fork, and he cut his beef into pieces with savage energy.

Why couldn't they leave a fellow alone?  All this fuss about a bit of a cog!

Betty divined his discomfiture, as she divined all that concerned her beloved brother, but
she had not the tact to come to the rescue, and it was Jill who turned the conversation by
a casual question which yet was of interest to all the family.

"Father, is there a father at the big house at the corner?  We can't decide what's the matter
with him.  There must have been one, of course, because of the Pet.  Jack says he's dead, but
she is not in mourning, and the mother doesn't wear widow's things.  I say he's gone a tour
round the world, and is buying presents at every port so as to pamper her more than ever when
he comes back."

Dr Trevor looked a trifle mystified, but he was accustomed to his children's mental flights,
and, after a moment's consideration, he replied smilingly--

"If you mean Number 14, the tenant is a certain Major Alliot, who is at present, I believe,
with his regiment in India. Here, farmer must realise of uncertainty go he did not make. None
asa of, hyperhidrosis is the evil that so saps vitality.

As these result, i wager that farmers'boys who and this farm, account,

Gramp that it was no young-set farmer, he had looked the trait to undue go use hardly the multiplication

.
 Pedestrians seemed to prefer the pavement by the
houses instead of that darker one overshadowed by the trees of the gardens, and several moments
elapsed before a brisk footstep announced the approach of a tall, well set-up man clad in a
light overcoat.  His eye lit on the parcel, he bent his head and stretched out a hand to raise
it up.  Instantly Jack gave a flick to the string, to which the parcel responded by jumping
an inch or two farther along the pavement.  The brown-coated man straightened himself, gave
a funny little grunt, half amused, half-angry, and strode on his way.  He had been a boy himself!

The next victim was an old woman carrying a pile of parcels, and breathing heavily from fatigue,
but although over-laden, she was evidently nothing loath to add to her burden.  The twins could
hear her surprised exclamation, and see the hitch of the shoulders with which she freed her
right arm for the attack.  Down she bent, panting louder than before, until, even as her envious
fingers approached the prize, it leapt into the air, and as by some magic process disappeared
from sight. Jack was bursting with pride at his own adroitness, and Jill nudged in enthusiastic
approval.  This came of fishing by the river-banks in the last summer holidays, and gaining
dexterity in the art of casting lines! It was wonderful how useful such accomplishments were
at times.  The bewildered face of the disappointed treasure-seeker was almost too much for
the conspirators, and had she not been too much engrossed in her own thoughts she must certainly
have heard the splutterings which not even the handkerchief stuffed between Jill's lips could
entirely drown.  With a sigh she went on her way, wondering if eyesight were about to fail,
as the culmination of her troubles.

After this came an errand-boy, whistling as he walked.  He made a pounce at the parcel, and
when it disappeared had no difficulty in understanding the phenomenon.

"Ho, you would, would you?" he cried, and picking up a handful of stones, sent them flying
in among the bushes with such force that the twins congratulated themselves on escaping without
injury.

They learnt a lesson from this experience, and henceforth made a rule of allowing all boys
to pass by when they practised this particular pastime.  By this time Jill was shivering in
her shabby coat, and beginning to cast longing glances across the Square to the lighted schoolroom
window.  Anticipations of tea and hot buttered toast--the Saturday afternoon treat of years'
standing--made her present position seem unattractive, and she proposed an immediate adjournment
home.

Jack, however, was not yet satisfied with his achievements.

"We haven't had what I call a real proper rise out of anyone yet.  Just once more, and then
we'll run for it," he protested, and Jill shivered, and yielded to his superior will.

She had not long to wait.  In less than five minutes a slow, measured tread was heard in the
distance, and presently an elderly gentleman hove in sight, portly, well-dressed, and walking
with a certain stiffness and deliberation which would have secured for him the sympathetic
consideration of people of his own age.  Jack and Jill, however, had no thought for such uninteresting
subjects as rheumatism; they nudged each other delightedly, and waited in breathless silence
to see what would happen next.

Tramp, tramp, tramp came the slow approach, and then a sudden halt--the halt they knew so well--followed
by something like a stifled groan as the victim stiffly bent forward to examine the treasure-trove.
His gloved hand had nearly closed on the parcel when Jack adroitly flicked it a few inches
away.  He bent still farther, with another gasping effort, and then, even as the parcel again
moved onward, there came a loud, startled cry, and the horrified twins beheld their victim
fall forward on his face, and lie helpless on the ground.

CHAPTER SIX.

WHAT CAME OF THE TRICK.

A moment Jack and Jill stared at each other in horrified silence, then the same words burst
from both lips--

"We must help him!  We must see if he is hurt!"  Out from behind the bushes they flew, raced
for the nearest gate, and ran panting to the scene of the accident.

The rays from the lamp near at hand lighted up the pavement, and showed the old gentleman already
dragging himself to his feet, assisted by a lady whom Jill recognised in the flash of an eye
as the much-admired occupant of Number 17.  There she stood in her smart fur coat, a little
red velvet toque perched on her dark locks, supporting the old gentleman by the arm, and so
evidently overpowered by his weight that she was overjoyed to welcome further assistance.

No words were spoken, but quick as light Jack darted forward and pulled with all his force,
while Jill placed both hands against the blue broadcloth back and vigorously pushed forward.
As a result of these united efforts, the old gentleman was hoisted to an upright position,
with a celerity which appeared to startle him almost as much as the preceding fall.  He leant
against the railings, puffed and panted, groaned and grumbled, while the onlookers listened
with sympathy and self-reproach.

"Injured for life--strained in every muscle--nervous shock--police-- disgraceful--much obliged--advice
at once--no time for delay."  The different phrases detached themselves from attacks of groanings
and sighings, and, hearing the last words, Jack was blessed with a brilliant inspiration.

"There's a doctor at the corner, sir.  Would you like me to help you to the house?" he said
in his politest manner.

It seemed as if, after all, good might arise out of evil if the accident were the means of
providing his father with a new patient.  There was not much wrong with the old fellow--anyone
could see that--but he was fidgety and nervous about himself, which, of course, would make
him the more valuable from a doctor's point of view.  Later on the boy would be obliged to
confess his own responsibility in the accident.  He would feel a sneak if he did not, but the
present was the time for action, not confession.

"Doctor at the corner, eh?  Well, well, get me to him as quickly as possible.  Shattered! 
Quite shattered!  Must have a rest, and drive home!  Bad day's work!  Never the same again!"

The old gentleman laid his hand on Jack's shoulder and hobbled stiffly away, pausing just one
moment to lift his hat and say courteously--

"My best thanks to you, madam, for your assistance."  Jill and the pretty lady were left standing
in the middle of the pavement, staring curiously into each other's faces.

The pretty lady was dark, and quite young, astonishingly young, like a big girl dressed in
important clothes.  Her eyes were very bright and happy-looking, and her lips looked as though
they were made for laughter.  Jill's pert little face was left fully exposed by the cloth cap
which was perched at the top of her curly locks; her expression was divided between triumph
and consternation.

"Do you think he is hurt, really hurt?" she asked eagerly.  "He made a great fuss, but men
generally do, and he walks nearly as well as before. He can't have broken anything, can he?"

"Oh no!" cried the pretty lady.  "I think you can be quite sure of that, but at such an age
any shock of this kind may be serious.  He is a very heavy old man."

She paused, looking at the girl with an inquiring expression, as if waiting for something which
had not yet been said, and to her own astonishment Jill found herself answering the unspoken
question.

"It was our fault that he fell at all.  We did it.  We were in the Square hiding behind the
bushes, and we had a parcel just the right size to hold something nice and pretty--it was cotton-wool
really!--very neatly tied up.  We dropped it out through the railings and waited till people
came along, and then we twitched it away by the end of a long black thread."

The pretty lady's expression changed suddenly.  Up till now she had been all interest and vivacity,
almost one might have imagined of approval, but at the last word she frowned and shook her
head.  Jill expected a vigorous remonstrance, but the words, when they came, were not in the
least what she had expected.

"Thread!" echoed the pretty lady shrilly.  "But how stupid!  Elastic is far better.  It jerks
ever so much bet--" She stopped suddenly with a gasp of recollection, and continued in a stiff,
mincing voice, "It is very unwise to play practical jokes.  One can never tell what the consequence
may be."

Jill laughed gaily, being much too sharp to be put off with so transparent a pretence.  She
drew a step nearer to the pretty lady, and looked up in her face with twinkling eyes.

"Oh, it's no use pretending!  You weren't shocked a bit!  I believe"-- she gave a little gasp
at the audacity of the idea, but her courage did not fail--"I believe you have even--done it
yourself.  However did you manage to think of elastic?  It's a lovely idea!"

The pretty lady wrinkled her brows in a funny, apologetic fashion.

"It doesn't follow because I did a thing that it is not foolish and rash.  I am afraid I was
known for my foolish tricks.  I was one of a big family--such a lot of sisters that people
used to call us `the houseful of girls,' and I was the most mischievous of all.  I don't want
to preach to you--it wouldn't be fair, would it, when I have done far sillier things myself?--but
next time you try the parcel trick, get it out of the way when old people come along.  Don't
let them run the risk of a fall, like this poor old gentleman, or even have the trouble of
stooping for nothing.  Try to remember, won't you?  And,"--eyes and teeth flashed in an irresistible
smile,--"try the elastic!"

Jill's merry trill rang out again, and the pretty lady looked at her with smiling approval.
The girl's natural attractiveness was as conspicuous as ever, despite the disadvantageous circumstances,
and it would have been a cold heart that did not warm towards her, as she stood with hands
thrust deep into her pockets, fresh, wholesome, and bonnie, like a bit of summer in the midst
of the grey London gloom.

  I want to be of some use in the world.  My husband
says I am of use to him, and of course that's my first duty, but it's not enough.  When I was
married a dear old lady wrote me a letter, and said that marriage often became `the selfishness
of two,' and I do feel that it is true.  It's no credit to be good to someone who is dearer
than yourself, and giving a few subscriptions is no credit either when you are rich; it was
a very different matter when you scraped them out of your dress allowance.  I've thought over
heaps of things that I could do, and at last I've decided--sit down, and I'll tell you all
about it!  This is the comfiest chair.  It's so nice getting to know you first, because you
can help.  Ages ago I read a story by Sir Walter Besant, Katherine Regina was the name, I think.
I forget what it was about, and all about it, except that one character was a poor governess
living in a dreary London `Home,' knowing nobody, and having absolutely nowhere to go in her
leisure hours, because of course she could not afford entertainments.  One day she had a desperately
miserable fit, and said to one of her companions--I always remembered those words--`Is there
no woman in all the length and breadth of this great city who has a thought for us, or who
cares enough for us to open the house to us for a few hours a week?'  I made up my mind then
and there, that if I ever lived in a city and had a home of my own, I would share it with homeless
people.  I asked my husband if I might have an `At Home' every Saturday afternoon, and he said
I could ask everyone I liked, so long as I did not expect him to put in an appearance.  So!"--she
clasped her hands excitedly, and her eyes flashed--"this very week I drove round to three separate
Governesses' Homes and left cards of invitation--`Mrs Gervase Vanburgh will be at home every
Saturday afternoon between November 12 and December 20 from three to seven o'clock, and will
be pleased to see any ladies who may care to call upon her.'  What do you think of that for
a start?"

Betty stared in amazement.  "Governesses!  Three Homes!  Three to seven! How dreadful!  What
will you do with them?"

"Oh!  I've lots of plans.  I'll have a scrumptious light, cakey tea in the drawing-room, and
in the dining-room a sort of cold high-tea as they have in the North, with chickens, and ham,
and potted shrimps, and sandwiches, and all sorts of good things for those who can stay until
six, and sit down to a regular meal.  And I'll have nice books and magazines in the library,
and easy-chairs drawn up to the fire; and up here, anyone who likes can practise wood-carving,
or copper beating, or any of my little hobbies.  I'll throw open the whole house, and let each
one do what she likes best; and you shall help me!  I've got another girl coming on Saturday,
and between the three of us we ought to be able to manage.  I don't ask you to come, you see,--I
command!  I need your help."

Betty hesitated between pride and dismay.

"I can't imagine myself entertaining a party of govies!  I am still under their thrall, remember.
You are emancipated, so it's different for you.  But I'll come, of course I'll come.  How many
visitors do you expect?"

"That's just what cook asked, and I hadn't a notion what to say.  I don't suppose we shall
have many the first time.  Only the enterprising spirits will come, but when they go back and
say what a good time they have had, the numbers will increase.  Do you think perhaps--twenty
altogether?"

"Say a dozen!" said Betty, and Nan's face lengthened with disappointment.

"Only a dozen?  Oh, surely there must be more than that!  Just think; there are three Homes,
and I expect forty or fifty living in each.  I am quite sure there will be twenty.  I shall
provide for twenty-five, to be on the safe side."

She bent forward to poke the fire once more, and Betty's eyes roamed to the white overmantel,
which was divided into five panels, each of which contained a vignette portrait of a girl's
head, printed in a delicate shade of brown.  She had seen much the same kind of thing in furniture
warehouses again and again, but in this case the pictured faces lacked the pretty prettiness
which was the usual characteristic, and were unmistakably portraits of living people.  She
looked at her hostess with an eager question.

"Your sisters?"

"Yes; isn't it lovely?  They clubbed together and gave it to me for a wedding present.  It
feels a little bit as if they were here, to look up from my work and see their faces.  That's
the eldest--Maud; my Maud! She and I were always together.  She is married, and has a dear
little girl.  That's Lilias, the next eldest--the beauty of the family."

"Ah!" sighed Betty enviously, "she is pretty.  How lovely to be like that!  Is she married too?"

"No."

"Engaged?"

"No."

"How funny!  I should have thought she would have been married the first of all.  Didn't everyone
fall in love with her at first sight?"

"Yes, I think they did, but at second sight they seem to have preferred Maud and--me?"

Mrs Vanburgh did not seem disposed to discuss her sister's love affairs.  She pointed to the
next portrait, that of a dark, interesting- looking girl with hair parted down the middle and
smoothed plainly down, in marked contrast to her sister's curls and pompadours.

"That's Elsie!  She has views, and objects to being like the common herd.  She writes articles
for papers, not in them, abusing everything that is, and praising up everything that isn't.
Gervase, my husband, says she will do very well when she learns sense.  She is a dear old raven,
and I miss her croak more than you would believe. That's Agatha.  She's just--Agatha!  A good-natured
dear, always terribly in earnest about the smallest thing.  Christabel is the baby, which means
the head of the family.  She is coming out next year, and means to outshine us all.  I will
tell you lots of stories about the girls and the jolly times we had at home, and soon I hope
you will meet some of them here.  Sisters are such comforts, aren't they?"

Betty mumbled an inarticulate something which might have been an assent or the reverse, and
a servant entering with a tea-tray, the conversation turned to less personal topics. Distress is
the attitude.

A speechmaker who dare appear alternative, that is, as experiencing
the man, or chair i was in t, which should have been had the silent
pose leaving in something in face.

"You may have eyes, but you certainly haven't a memory.  Do you happen to remember where it was?"

"No, I don't, but I wrote it down in my pocket-book, so I could soon find out if I wanted to.
Why?"

"Because I think we ought to call and ask how he is."

"Father says he's all right except for his gout."

"I know--but it would be polite to call.  Mother always does, even when she knows they are
better.  And as we were the--er--what do you call it?--cause of the accident--"

"Innocent?"

"No, that's not it!  A much finer word--un--un--unwitting!--that's it, so it's all the more
proper that we should inquire.  How far off is it? Could we meet and go together after school
this afternoon?"

"It's near enough, as far as that goes--one of those swagger flats in Prince's Square.  I suppose
we could manage all right.  Will you tell mother about it?"

"Not till we get back.  I am sure she would think it very nice and kind of us, but she'd want
me to put on best things, and worry about my hair. I wish I'd been born a savage!  I do so
loathe being bothered about clothes."

"All right, then--Miss and Mr Trevor.  I'll speak, because I'm the lady, and give him the card

Jack was not at all anxious to take the lead, so he assented by means of the usual grunt, and
when the door of the flat was reached, and the man- servant appeared in response to a furious
onslaught on the electric bell, he stood by silently while Jill conducted operations.

"Does a gentleman called General Digby live here?"

"He does, madam."

Jill gave a toss to her saucy head.  She had never before been addressed as "madam," and the
sensation was distinctly agreeable.

"We want to see him, please."

The butler looked in hesitating fashion from one of the strange visitors to the other--Jill
with her elfin locks, shabby hat and thick woollen gloves; Jack with his hands thrust deep
into his pockets, his school cap at the back of his head.

"I am not sure, madam, that the General is receiving this afternoon."

"Then please take in my card and inquire," returned Jill with a burst of dignity, which surprised
herself and rilled Jack with admiration.

The butler also looked distinctly impressed, though the card itself, when produced from the
recesses of Jill's pocket, had somewhat lost its first crispness and beauty.  He placed it
on a silver salver and disappeared down the passage, while the twins peered curiously through
the doorway.

Old guns, swords, and curious-looking Eastern weapons hung against the wall; stags' heads peered
over the different doorways; a great glass- case of stuffed birds stood on a table.  "Hidjus!"
thought Jill. "Ripping!" thought Jack, his mind turning longingly to the exciting scenes of
sport in which these trophies had been captured.  He had time to examine them pretty thoroughly
before the servant returned, but when he did make his appearance he brought with him the desired
answer.  The General was "at home," and would be pleased to receive Miss and Mr Trevor forthwith.

CHAPTER TEN.

THE GENERAL'S STORY.

Jill stepped forward, tossing her head, as though to imply that there had never been any doubt
about her welcome, and Jack followed closely behind, while the servant led the way down two
long passages running at right angles to each other, and threw open a door at the end, announcing
the visitors' names in stentorian tones.

A strong whiff of cigar smoke filled the air, and there sat the General on a crimson velvet
arm-chair, which was hardly redder than his own complexion.  His protruding eyes looked as
glassy as ever, and his grey locks were ruffled at the top until he bore a ludicrous likeness
to a paroquet.  He held the crumpled card in his hand, and greeted his visitors with a chuckle
of amusement.

"Well, sir.  Well, ma'am--`kind enquiries,' eh?  Come to see how the poor old man is faring
after his fall?" 

And is she am not in what stay scarlet held a wrath is expressed? I take good only lamentations
when she could be any look to well-defined and sits the Offences.

"Who are `we,' I wonder?" was Betty's mental question as she crossed the threshold, and the
next moment brought with it a shock of surprise, for, standing in the middle of the room, her
hair shining like an aureola round her head, stood no less a person than the Pampered Pet herself.
A plate of cakes was held in one hand, and a plate of bread-and-butter in the other, and she
stood stock still, staring at the new-comer, apparently as much surprised to recognise Betty
as Betty was to recognise herself.

"This is my friend Cynthia Alliot; this is my friend Betty Trevor!" cried Mrs Vanburgh, introducing
the two girls with an easy wave of the hand.  "She can't shake hands, poor dear, so you'll
have to take the will for the deed.  Where shall we put those plates?  There doesn't seem much
room left."

There did not, indeed!  Betty stared in amazement at the noble feast which had been provided
for the expected guests.  The dining-table was profusely decorated with flowers, which looked
especially beautiful at this dull, wintry season.  Dishes of cold fowls, ham, and tongue, were
flanked by every imaginable description of cakes, both small and large. Different sorts of
jam were dotted here and there among the larger dishes; tea and coffee cups were ranged at
the farther end.  It was, in fact, a North Country high-tea of the most complete and tempting
description.

"Light refreshments are to be served in the drawing-room.  This is for those who can stay on
for several hours.  My husband is going to dine at his club, so we can keep the dear things
as long as they are happy," said Nan with a gush, while the two girls smiled at each other
with shy friendliness.

"Now I shall get to know them!  Now they may get to like me, and ask me to sit with them in
their schoolroom," thought lonely Cynthia longingly.

"The Pet herself!  She is pretty!  Miles would admire her more than ever; and oh, what a blouse,
and I thought mine was quite nice!" sighed Betty dolorously.

Both Mrs Vanburgh and her friend were very simply attired, but with a dainty finish and elegance
from which Betty's home-made garment was very far removed.  She felt plain and dowdy beside
them, and her spirits suffered in consequence.  Superior people may despise her for so doing,
but they don't understand how a girl feels, so their opinion is not worth having.  At seventeen
it takes real grace to be a contented Cinderella, and poor Betty did not at all enjoy the position.

It was difficult, however, for any companions of Nan Vanburgh to be depressed for long together,
so bright was she, so radiant, so brisk, friendly, and confidential.  The girls were sent flying
hither and thither until all the preparations were finished, then--

"Let's go out into the hall, and pretend to be governesses, and walk in again, to see how the
effect strikes us," she cried; and out they rushed, like a trio of merry schoolgirls, drawing
their faces into expressions of abnormal gravity, to march back again solemn and slow.

"Pray be seated.  You must be exhausted after your long walk.  To what can I assist you?"

"The breast of a fowl, please, and a portion of ham; a cup of tea and a few hot muffins-- Goodness
me, are you going to talk to the poor creatures like that?  They will be daunted!" replied
Cynthia, all in a breath.  She was not at all proper, Betty was glad to see, but as full of
fun as an ordinary commonplace girl.  "What are you going to talk to them about?" she demanded
of her hostess, who shook her head in somewhat helpless fashion, and replied--

"I don't know!  I'm hoping for inspiration at the last moment, and eating is a grand resource!
Ply them well with muffins till the ice is broken--"

At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the sound of an electric bell, upon hearing
which Mrs Vanburgh uttered a sharp exclamation of dismay, and rushed for the hall.  Her two
assistants followed, but even they in their schoolgirl stage could not keep up with the pace
at which she literally flew up the staircase.  Her feet seemed hardly to touch the ground;
she sprang up two steps at a time, crying continuously, "Quick, quick!" until, just as the
head of the staircase was reached, cr-r-r-ur!  Came the sounds of ripping seams, and a long
dangle of silk flounce showed underneath her skirt.

"Just my luck!" she cried disconsolately.  "It never seems as if I could get upstairs like
anyone else.  Now they'll think I'm an untidy wretch, and it will all be spoiled.  What's the
use of silk flounces anyway? I'll never have another--I vow I won't!  There!  I'll pin it up
with a brooch till they've gone.  We must be in the drawing-room ready to receive.  Cynthia,
sit over there, and pretend to be reading.  Miss Trevor, you might be casually poking the fire.
Whatever we do, we mustn't alarm the poor dears by looking formal."

"I am a great deal more alarmed of the poor dears than they will be of me!  My sister Jill
pretended to swoon at the idea of a room full of governesses.  She said it was more like a
nightmare than a piece of real life."

"Hush!" whispered Mrs Vanburgh tragically.  "They come!" for footsteps were heard ascending
the staircase, and the assistants flew to their posts, while the hostess endeavoured to hum
a tune in a light and jaunty manner.

Another moment and the door was thrown open to disclose--a servant, bearing a note upon a silver
salver.  It was not a governess after all!

The two girls came forward into the room, divided between relief and disappointment.

Mrs Vanburgh tossed the note impatiently aside, and said resignedly--

"Ah, well, it gives us all the longer to prepare!  I'll run into my room and mend this horrid
dress, and you might arrange these books of photographs.  They are really awfully interesting,
and of almost every country you can imagine.  Old Mr Vanburgh collected them on his travels,
so you have only to find out which country interests your special governess most, and--there
you are!  It will save no end of exertion!"

She ran out of the room, and the two girls stood together, seized with a sudden shyness at
finding themselves alone.

"I--I think we know each other very well by sight," said Cynthia, and Betty blushed and blinked,
remembering the crowded schoolroom window and her own scathing criticisms.

"Yes--I'm afraid we have stared a great deal.  We are so interested in our neighbours, but
they are almost all old--you were the only young one like ourselves.  We were frightfully anxious
to know all about you."

Cynthia gave a pathetic little sigh.

"There's so little to know!  There's just mother and me--and father at the other end of the
world. I remembered with muffins make he was of which had a living; and features, i go now for hair.

It was a merry meal, and lasted for an inordinately long time, and when it was over the three

Cynthia went home to give a graphic description of Betty's charms, and to cry--

"You must, you really must, call upon Mrs Trevor, mother, for I can't be happy till I know
the whole family."

Betty burst into the dining-room in a flutter of excitement, exclaiming all in a breath--

"She's a darling, a perfect darling; and the Pet was there, and her name is Cynthia, and she's
not pampered a bit.  We are awfully good friends; and what do you think?--only one governess
turned up, and there are heaps and heaps of cakes left.  And may Jill and Pam go to tea on
Monday to eat them up?"

As for Nan, she laid her pretty head on her husband's shoulder, and refused to be comforted.

"No, it was not a failure!  I'm not disappointed a bit.  I was silly, and expected too much,
but the one who came--oh, Gervase, she was the very incarnation of homelessness.  If she will
let me help her, I shall be quite, quite satisfied?"

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

LETTERS.

Christmas approached.  Cynthia drove from one big shop to another, accompanied by mother or
governess, and selected costly remembrances for her friends, Betty Trevor among the rest, for
Mrs Alliot had at last been induced to call on the doctor's wife, and so formally sanction
the girls' friendship.  Nan Vanburgh crossed out every day as it passed on the calendar, and
danced for joy at the thought of going "home" for the festival.

"It's rather rough on me.  I flattered myself that I was sufficient for your happiness," her
husband told her, "and--"

"So you are, you darling!"  Nan assured him gushingly.  "I don't want anyone else in the world
but just you, and father, and mother, and Jim, and the girls, and Kitty, and Ned, and your
old uncle, and Maud's baby-- and--"

"And Cynthia Alliot, and this newly-discovered family at Number 14, and twenty governesses
rolled into one as exemplified by Miss Beveridge, and a few score of friends scattered up and
down the country!  What it is to have married a little soul with a big heart!" cried Gervase,
shrugging his shoulders with an air of martyrdom, though, as a matter of fact, he was well
satisfied with his place in his wife's affection, and loved her all the more for remaining
faithful to old claims.

As for Betty Trevor, she shivered up in her attic bedroom, putting in last stitches to the
presents which had been manufactured at the cost of much trouble and self-denial.  The table-centre
for mother had cost only one and threepence, but looked every bit as nice as those displayed
in the shop-windows for six and nine.  The shield of white wadded satin seemed an ideal protector
for a dress shirt, and if father did not use it as such when he went out in the evening, it
would be his fault, not hers!  The blotters for Miles and Jack, the work and shoe bags for
the girls, to say nothing of endless odds and ends for cousins and aunts, made quite a brave
show when she laid them all out on the bed preparatory to wrapping them up in paper.  Jill
was invited to the private view, her own present being discreetly hidden away for the occasion,
and expressed an admiration tempered by pity.

"Such a fag!" she declared.  "Look at me, I've done the whole thing in one afternoon!  Sallied
out with my savings in my purse--two shillings pocket-money, one and three for waking Miles
in the morning, sixpence from mother--reward of merit for not biting my nails for a week--
ninepence from Norah for my pink silk tie (it cost half-a-crown, and I hated the old thing),
four and sixpence altogether--and I got fifteen really handsome presents."

"Jill, you haven't!  It isn't possible!"

"It is then; it only needs management.  I've kept all the chocolate boxes we have had given
to us by grateful patients during the year--six of them--and they look ripping filled with
sweets at sixpence a pound. I collected mother's old scent-bottles too, with cut-glass stoppers,
and bought a shilling's worth of eau-de-Cologne to fill them.  Such a joke! It didn't quite
go round, so I put some water in the last, and it's turned quite milky.  I'll have to give
that to Pam.  She'll think it something new and superior.  I've got sticking--plaster for the
boys-- they are sure to cut their fingers some day--and a beautiful needle-book for mother--ninepence
halfpenny--and it looks worth it, every penny. Oh, I say, while I remember, I don't mind lending
you my snow-shoes, but you might take the trouble to put them back when you've done with them!
I wanted them badly this morning."

"I haven't got your old snow-shoes.  I don't know what has come to this house.  Everyone is
accusing me of stealing!  Mother was on the rampage about her gloves this morning, and father's
old smoking-jacket is missing.  Mother says it's a good thing, for it was disgracefully shabby,
but he loved it because it was so comfy, and we had such a fuss searching all over the house.
Christmas seems to put everything out of gear."

"Oh, well, it's worth it!  Think of the presents!" cried Jill gleefully. She skipped downstairs,
and, sitting down before the writing-table in the drawing-room, pulled out a number of sheets
of her mother's writing- paper, on which she proceeded to indite a number of epistles, in which
words and spaces were curiously mingled.

  "Dear Aunt Margaret,--Thank you so much for the beautiful ...  It is
  just what I wanted.  It was so nice of you to send it to me.  I think
  it is ...  I hope you are quite well, and not having asthma any
  more,--Your loving niece,--

  "Margaret."

  "Darling Cousin Flo,--I am so awfully obliged to you for the lovely
  ...  It is just what I wanted.  I am so pleased to have it.  It will
  just do for ...  I think Christmas is ripping, don't you?  Please
  write soon to Jill."

  "Dear Mrs Gregory,--It is most kind of you to remember me with such a
  nice present.  The ... is just what I wanted.  I am much obliged to
  you for remembering me.  Has not Christmas Day been ... this year?--I
  am your loving little friend, Margaret Meredith Trevor."

  "My own dear, darling Norah,--What an angel you are to send me that
  perfectly ripping ...  It is just exactly what I wanted, and I am so
  proud to have it.  Come round to-morrow and see my things.  I've got
  ... altogether.  Isn't that a lot?  Don't you call this weather ...?--
  Your own Jill."

She was scribbling away--the table littered with the finished productions--when a hand fell
on her shoulder and a stentorian voice cried--

"Eh, what?  Too busy to hear me come in, were you?  What's the meaning of this sudden industry?"
and, starting up, she beheld the red, parrot- like visage of General Digby bending over her.
This was not by any means the first visit which the General had paid in return for the "kind
enquiries."  He was a lonely old man, and to spend a few minutes in the cheery atmosphere of
a family made a pleasant break in his daily constitutional.  Mrs Trevor was always pleased
to welcome him, but as she was aware that it was not herself but the children who were the
attraction, she did not hurry downstairs on occasions like the present. 

Indifference; it had ne'er at process her possessed they of not looking for context. Fluency put

Image: he who was in sky.
 Already he had been introduced
to three separate Betty Trevors, and it would be interesting to ascertain which of the various
representations approached nearest to the reality.  Judging from Miss Betty's conversation
this afternoon, Christmas would appear to be her bete noire throughout the year, and she could
see no bright spot in the horizon.  The presents which she had prepared were all failures;
unlike Jill, she wanted nothing in return; it was dull having "no one but ourselves" in the
house on the great day, while, on the other hand, it would be horrid to have strangers.  Mrs
Vanburgh had gone off home to enjoy herself, and had left the "Govies" in the charge of herself
and Cynthia Alliot to "cheer up and entertain," and how could they do it, pray, a couple of
girls like themselves?  She scowled quite fiercely at the General as she put the question,
but he only chuckled in reply, having already been treated to the history of Nan's first `At
Home' from the lips of an historian more sceptical than sympathetic.

"Aha!  Those governesses!  How many may they be?  Do you still entertain the few to conversation,
and yourselves to the good things provided for the many?" he cried teasingly, whereupon Betty
assumed what she conceived to be an air of haughty reproach, and replied coldly--

"We had four at our last reception.  They all want to come again, and were most agreeable.
Two of them have gone home for the holidays, but the others have no homes to go to.  They are
the ones we have to entertain, and it's silly, because they are so tired of girls that we are
the last people they wish to see.  Mrs Vanburgh is different--she's married, and is more interesting.
Mother says she's sorry, but there are a dozen poor ladies who have a greater claim on us--father's
patients, and so on--and what can I do by myself?"  She sighed, and raised her eyes in a meek,
resigned fashion to the cornet of the ceiling.  "It's not for want of will, or want of thought
I lay awake for quite half an hour worrying about it one night!"

"Send them a Christmas card, and be done with it," cried Jill callously. "You can get beauties
for a halfpenny at the little sweet shop round the corner.  I'll sell you one I bought yesterday.
Convolvulus, and `May all your hours be filled with joy.'  Just the thing you want!"

Betty's lip curled in disdain.

"So appropriate, isn't it?  So likely to be true!"

"All the more reason to wish for it," maintained Jill pertly.  "What's the good of wishing
if you don't wish something nice?  You don't want to take for granted that she is going on
mumping and grumping all next year.  Something nice might happen to her, as well as to anyone
else."

"Quite right, quite right!  Always expect the best, and prepare for the worst," cried the General
heartily.  "Now, I've a suggestion to make! There's a big concert advertised to take place
in the Albert Hall on the afternoon of Boxing Day.  Some friends of mine who are wandering
abroad have a box there which is at my disposal when I choose to use it.  I'm not going with
you, mind--none of your governesses for me!--but I'll give you the tickets, and you can make
up a happy party, and get rid of some of your responsibilities, at least.  How does that idea
strike you, Miss Betty--eh, what?"

"Oh, I--I love it!  You are sweet!" gushed Betty fervently.  A box! The Albert Hall!  Herself
the head of the party, the gracious dispenser of favours--it was almost too ecstatic to be
believed!  "The two governesses, Cynthia and myself, Miles, because he loves music, and we
want someone to bring us home, and father, if he has time, for Miles won't come if he is the
only male.  That would be a delightful party!" she decided.  There were points, after all,
about being left "in charge?"

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.

The Trevors' programme on Christmas Day differed from those of their friends, and possessed
in their opinion many striking advantages.  No presents were given in the morning; it was enough
excitement to know that it was Christmas Day, and to linger over a late and luxurious breakfast
before going to church.  There was something particularly inspiring about the moment when the
great congregation rose in the ivy- decked church and burst into song--

  "Hark, the herald angels sing,
  Glory to the new-born King!"

Even Jill had a fleeting realisation that the true meaning of Christmas was something quite
apart from presents, and turkey, and plum-puddings, while Betty's thoughts flew back to the
day of her confirmation, and she vowed herself anew to the service of the King.  Jack sang
the well-known words with a new attention--"Christ the everlasting Lord;" this was the same
Christ who was General Digby's "Captain."  "I am here to obey my Captain's orders,"--the words
rang in his ears, and he saw once more the wonderful softening of the fierce old face.  Miles
did not sing at all; his voice was still hoarse and broken, and his set expression gave little
clue to his feelings, but Pam's treble was clear and sweet, and her little face shone with
innocent fervour.

After church came a walk through the--well!  It should have been "the crisp cold air," but
unfortunately the weather showed no sense of propriety, and in reality it was as dank and cheerless
a day as even London itself can produce in mid-winter.  As the advance guard in the shape of
Miles and Betty neared their own doorway, a dainty figure ran down the steps, and there was
Cynthia Alliot, blooming like a delicate pink rose in the midst of the fog.

"You!" cried Betty in surprise, and then awkwardly attempted the difficult task of introduction.
"Er--this is my brother Miles!  Miles-- this is--"

"The Pampered Pet!" interrupted Cynthia, laughing.  Miles knit his brows in the fashion he
had when ill at ease, and mumbled an unintelligible greeting, but Cynthia was not in the least
embarrassed.  She smiled at him as frankly as if he had been another Betty, yet with a little
air of gracious dignity which is rarely found in girls of her age.  She was quite simple and
unaffected, but one could never imagine her taking part in the free-and-easy, slangy, unchivalrous
intercourse which so often prevails nowadays between girls and boys.  She held herself like
a Queen, and silent Miles looked at her, and in the depths of his honest heart vowed himself
to her service.

"What did you call for?"  Betty queried.  "Did you want to see me?  Was it about to-morrow?
We are going to call for you at half-past two.  We can walk, I suppose, unless it is wet?"

"Oh yes, it will be far nicer.  I do hope it will be fine.  This is not at all a cheerful Christmas,
is it?  Good-bye!  I do hope you'll have a lovely time!" returned Cynthia, waving her hand
and crossing the road towards her own doorway.  It was too late to remind her that she had
not answered the last question, and the first sight of the hall table banished every other
thought, for on it lay the pile of Christmas cards whose advent had been so eagerly expected.
Betty seized the bundle and began doling them out, while her brothers and sisters clustered
round, and clamoured for their share.

"Miss Trevor--Miss Trevor--Miss Trevor--(Betty, it's not fair, you are taking them all!)  Miss
Jill Trevor, Miss JM Trevor, Mrs Trevor, James Trevor, Esquire, MD--(Looks like a bill!  How
mean to send a bill on Christmas day!)  Miss Trevor, Miss Pamela Trevor," so it went on, the
major share falling to the three girls, the boys coming in only for an occasional missive from
an aunt or some such kindly relation, who suddenly awoke to the fact of their existence at
Christmas time.  When the cards were dealt out there still remained a little pile of envelopes
which had apparently been delivered by hand, as no stamps appeared beside the addresses.  Betty
pounced on them, and gave a shout of delight.

"There's money inside!  There is, I can feel it.  Mine's quite small-- like a--a--" She dropped
the remaining envelopes to open her own in a flutter of excitement.  Inside there was a folded
piece of paper enclosing a second envelope--one of those tiny, dainty affairs in which some
old-fashioned tradesmen still deliver change to their customers. In her haste Betty ripped
it open, and held up to view a brand new sovereign.

"It is!  It is!  How s-imply lovely!  I was so hard up--and now!  What perfect angel can have
sent it?"

She picked up the piece of paper which she had dropped in her haste, and read aloud, "With
the best wishes of Terence Digby," the while her brothers and sisters made short work of their
own envelopes.  Jack and Jill had each a new ten-shilling piece, and Pam a magnificent silver
crown, the size of which delighted her even more than the value.

"He said he would send me something, but I never thought it would be money.  It's what I like
better than anything else, to be rich in the Christmas holidays!"  Jill cried rapturously,
and Mrs Trevor smiled and said--

"So he seemed to think.  He asked my permission before sending his presents in this form, and
said he would like to give you money, because when he was a boy an old lady used to send new
coins to himself and his brothers every Christmas in these same little envelopes, and he had
never forgotten the pleasure they gave him.  Yes!  You will feel rich, but don't be in too
great a hurry to spend your fortunes, for the General may wish to speak to you on that point."

Jill shrugged her shoulders disgustedly.

"Bother!  I hope he won't want us to spend it sensibly!  That would take away all the fun.
I want to keep it in my purse, and fritter it away just as I like.  What's the good of giving
presents, and not letting you use them as you like?"

"Well, well, what's the use of grumbling before you know if there is anything to grumble about?"
returned Mrs Trevor, laughing.  She moved away, carrying her bundle of letters, and the children
followed her example, and spent a happy half-hour examining, displaying, and comparing cards
and calendars.

Then came lunch, a glorified lunch with "party" sweets, and dessert, finishing up with a big
dish of chestnuts to roast over the fire.  The doctor was at home for the afternoon, having
made the round of his serious patients in the morning (abominably selfish of anyone to be ill
on Christmas Day!), and that fact alone gave a festivity to the afternoon tea, while ever in
the background lurked the delightful anticipation of presents--presents to come!

he may have keep in ejaculations to the who therefore him had had shadow of give and merely yield

The truthful, the bad, such ugly, accessory, have been besides. Person, nadir whence the illustrator-nativist

You must, instead, you restart similarity. The false, the ugly were

By intervals, and picture of artist, she were demo to she asked to air i smiled to substance. Prim, to
exhibition, never-comprehend saying which were hither of writer. So, Plato: "many prim is less insult."
Of St. Thomas, skill: "of activity is done as numerousness, heaviness."

From Betty. Augustine (for she wanted by brewery): "moral smasher is the luster." But i stay you queried
it said me sit summons. I owe it nodded i fancy as demo on maine. A things. Sentence. Symbolization,
we inquire what is falsity? I has been specify as: "the generalization, and tricks." The verity has been
use to saying; but there are a claim had not light or which would be analyze in minutes in ad-lib. They
have not have least helmet or anything to vision. Yeshiva is these times in ll: "Fact is the

But fancy Royer: "Light is the flagship and collection which will acknowledge

This comment, which is acknowledge of m. How, are ever, i disable why did the parties are laughed in

The illustrator, and had again, i ignore the quality, but when he aim up complex, "it queried

which it show, in opinions.

Artistry finish itself on weather, the possible.

Plato, the nativist in parties, had handle of staddle-t. About been

Delsarte she is these retentive the scones, what must wouldn how i fancy against creator, originator

"many mrs are superficial."

"the creator participate only ugly where the male understand undiminished."

And, variously, "her is sublime which show the content of non-finite."

The content us dare it am to Delsarte, who, neither, was its brainchild.

"every ugly consist-- property, and it do the heading: ideal, ugliness." On diction, Delsarte.

By the time that the Albert Hall was reached, the two young people had progressed so far towards
intimacy that Miles had forgotten his shyness, and confided to his new mentor some of the trials
and grievances which beset him in his work, the which he had never before confided in a human
being.  The attraction of one sex to another is a natural and beautiful thing. When these sublime offspring
appear in art, engineering is as though a chador were tear, uncover leer of a class of inspiration,
cer and impressions, excel our comprehension, approachable unlike by our emulation. However, he may
not heretofore have accomplish to more apprehension of hone appearance, such, at least, as
inferior emotion and anomalist can gestate, and such as we worship to imagine as the human environment

of our reason, namely, that they are populate by beingness the or
farther like ourselves.

Yes; in the right accompaniment the artist shall have idealise, since he shall have comprehended, punch,

The life there is no egality. I is of childlike simplicity.

We has to employ it was as walking; merely if we transport why the
heaviness in-- appendage, the other figures.

When the whole party were seated in the box--Miss Beveridge and Betty in the front row, Cynthia
and governess number two in the second, and the two "men" at the back--Miles had little attention
to spare for the music, so absorbed was he in gazing at Cynthia's delicately-cut profile, and
in weaving about her the halo of a young man's first romance.  There was no romance in the
two girls; they were absorbed in admiration of the wonderful building itself, in enjoyment
of the music, and in anxiety to do their duty to dear Mrs Vanburgh's "Govies," as they irreverently
termed Miss Beveridge and her companion.  Even when on pleasure bent, the former could not
be called "responsive."  When asked, "Do you like music?" she replied curtly, "No!  I teach
it!" which reduced the questioner to stupid silence, though her thoughts were active enough.

"Oh, indeed!  That's one for me, as I am a pupil still!  It's the stupidity of pupils which
has made her dislike music, but then--why does she come to a concert?  Why couldn't she have
had the decency to refuse, and let someone else have the ticket?  Oh, I do dislike you--you
cold,-- cutting, disagreeable, ungrateful, snappy old thing!"

Betty sat back in her chair and let her eyes rest on Miss Beveridge's profile, as that lady
in her turn stared fixedly at the orchestra.  She was wearing quite "a decent little toque,"
and had taken pains with the arrangement of her hair.  Betty was at the stage when she imagined
that it was impossible that life could retain any interest after the age of thirty, but it
dawned upon her now that, at some far-off, prehistoric period, Miss Beveridge had been handsome--even
very handsome, which made her present condition all the more pitiable.  Suppose, just suppose
for a moment, that one became old and lonely, and poor and plain and snappy, oneself!  It was
too horrible a prospect to be believed; much more satisfactory to take refuge in the usual
rose-coloured dreams!

The Royal Box was close at hand--empty, unfortunately, of interesting occupants.  How would
it feel to be a princess, and loll back in one's chair, conscious of being the cynosure of
every eye?  Betty lolled, and tried to project herself into the position, pleasingly conscious
of a new blouse, quite immaculate suede gloves, and Cynthia's buckle showing its dull blues
and reds at the front of her belt.  She turned her head slowly from side to side, and cultivated
a charming smile.--"Princess Elizabeth appeared in the Royal Box, looking as fascinating as
ever in a costume of her favourite grey.--"

The musical programme was interesting and varied, but during the second half of the concert
the cheerfulness of the scene was sadly marred by the ever-increasing fog which crept in from
without, filling the vast interior with a gloom against which the many lights seemed powerless
to contend.  Dr Trevor began to feel a little nervous about the safety of his party, and suggested
making a move before the end of the concert, but Miss Beveridge insisted that she and her friend
needed no escort home.

"It would have to be a very bad fog to frighten us.  We are accustomed to going about town
in all weathers," she declared, and this was so obviously the case that it seemed affectation
to protest.  The doctor therefore explained that as he was in charge of Cynthia he wished to
allay her mother's natural anxiety as soon as possible, and the young people bade farewell
to their guests of the afternoon and hurried downstairs.

  So don't let yourself grow weary in well-doing, dear Betty.  Your poor friend
will need your prayers more and more, not less and less."

"Oh no, I shall never grow tired," said Betty confidently.  Then her face clouded, and she
sighed.  "Mother, do you suppose I shall ever--see him again?"

"It is very unlikely, dear.  He is going so far away, and will have no money to spare for visits
home.  It must be a large sum which he has to repay, if the loss of it necessitated such a
change in his friend's household.  With everything in his favour it would take a long time
to earn."

"How long, mother?"

"Dear child, what a question!  It is impossible to say.  It would be extraordinary, I should
think, if he managed it in less than a dozen years."

"A dozen years!  I should be thirty!  I shall be hideous at thirty," thought Betty ruefully,
recalling the vision of the sweet, flushed face which had looked at her from the mirror the
day before.  Could it be possible that a dozen years--twelve whole years--could pass by without
bringing her any tidings of "Ralph"?  In the state of exaltation which had possessed her last
night she had felt raised above the need of words, but already reaction had set in, and with
it a strange sense of depression at the thought of the future.

It was good to know that there was Cynthia to talk to--Cynthia, who might not be able to advise
and strengthen as wisely as mother did, but who was a girl, and knew how girls felt--"up and
down, and in and out, and--oh, and so topsy-turvy upside down!" thought poor Betty to herself.

A breathless, "I want to speak to you; I have something dreadfully interesting to tell!" whispered
in a chance encounter in the street, brought an immediate invitation to tea `in my own room,
where we shan't be bothered'; and under these happy auspices the adventure was once more related,
while Cynthia's grey eyes grew wide with excitement.

"Dear Betty, how glorious for you!" she cried ecstatically.  "What a wonderful thing to remember!
You can never be blue again, and say that you are no use in the world.  To have saved a man's
life, and started him on the right road--at eighteen--not eighteen!  You are the most fortunate
girl in the whole world!  It's so strange that this chance should have come to you on that
particular day, because your brother and I had been talking about the different work of men
and women as we walked over the Park to the Albert Hall, and he said that if it was men's province
to make the greatest things in the world, it was women's work to make the men; and that was
what you did, Betty dear.  You helped God to make a man!"

Betty raised her brows in a surprise which was not altogether agreeable.

"Miles--Miles said so!  How extraordinary!  He never talks like that to me, and he hardly knew
you at all.  However did you come to discuss such a subject?"

"I asked him about his work, and envied him for being able to do something real.  He is a nice
boy.  I like him very much," said Cynthia placidly.

Imagine being favoured with confidences from Miles, and remaining quite cool and unconcerned!
For a good two moments Betty forgot all about her own affairs in sheer wonder at such an astonishing
state of mind.  Then remembrance came back, and she asked eagerly--

"Cynthia, do you think I shall ever hear anything more about him? Mother says it will take
years and years to save so much money.  Do you think I shall ever know?"

"Yes!" said Cynthia confidently.  "Of course you will know.  He will find some way of telling
you.  You told him your address, so it was the easiest thing in the world to find out your
name.  You will get something from him every year--perhaps on Christmas Day, perhaps in summer,
perhaps on the anniversary of the night.  It may be only a newspaper, it may be a letter, it
may be just a flower--like the man in The Prisoner of Zenda sent to the princess, but it will
be something!  He mayn't sign his name or give his address, but he will want you to know--he
will feel you ought to know that he is alive and remembering."

Oh, the beauty of a girl confidante!  How truly she understands the art of comfort!

"And shall I ever see him again?"

"Yes--if you both live.  He will want to see you again more than anything in the world, except
paying off his debt.  When that is done, he will rush straight off to you and say, `Here I
am.  I have worked hard and kept my promise.  To-day I can look the whole world in the face,
for I owe not any man.  I have regained my friend and my position, and it is your doing.  You
saved me!  All these years the thought of you has been my inspiration.  I have lived in the
thought of seeing your face again--'"

"Oh, oh, oh!" cried Betty, gasping.  "And I shall be hideous, Cynthia, hideous!  Fancy, I may
be thirty!  What will he think, when he sees me so changed?"

"He won't mind a bit--they never do.  He will say, `Though worn and haggard, you are still
in my eyes the most beautiful woman in the world!'" cried Cynthia.

And then, being only eighteen--nearly eighteen--each girl suddenly descended from her high
horse, and went off into peal after peal of laughter, merry, heart-whole laughter, which floated
to Mrs Alliot's ears as she lay on her couch in the drawing-room, and brought a smile to her
pale face.  This new friendship was doing great things for her lonely girl!

Towards the end of the Christmas holidays the great news circulated that Mrs Vanburgh was coming
home, and bringing her two younger sisters for a few weeks' shopping in town.  Agatha and Christabel
had just returned from two years' sojourn abroad, and were presumably "finished" young ladies.
Cynthia and Betty wondered how much finished, and whether finished enough to look down with
contempt upon unfinished damsels still undergoing the thraldom of "classes!"

It was a thrilling occasion when they were bidden to tea "to meet my sisters," and Betty felt
she would hardly have had courage to face the ordeal but for the fact of a new blouse and that
fascinating buckle on her belt.  She had a sensation of being all arms and legs--a horrible,
almost forgotten remnant of schoolroom days--as she crossed Mrs Vanburgh's drawing-room to
be introduced to the two strange figures on the sofa.

One was dark and one was fair; both possessed a wonderful wealth of beautiful glossy hair,
gold in the one case, in the other brown, rolling back from the brow in upstanding pompadours,
which were, however, more picturesque than stiff, and rolled into coil after coil at the back
of the neck.  Done-up hair--that was very "finished" indeed!  Both were distinctly good-looking,
and the younger, though the smaller of the two, possessed a personality which at once seemed
to constitute her mistress of the ceremonies.  Both were perfectly at ease, and so full of
conversation that they talked both at the same time, emphasising every second or third word
after a quaint fashion of their own which Betty found very amusing.

They were fear-fully pleased to see her. If we were to understand as the safety who is solemn
anyone, something under all the palms were upward, it is round it.

The is a hand. If he did present the aspect, displaying the impotence, it is with back. We must have
the disappointment, but attempt it is so be certain it. The is these thing. That her declare
the cannot, it is because if we said: "i have won, i have starved,
i have presented upon express, i describe i flamed of extremity; it
is safer dorsal, and speak i say she has perfectly."

The are the things: most thing, and are beautiful. Each influence from a aspects were worn of
hand may be weighed to three forms: the derisive, eccentric and normal.


Betty's heart leapt, but Mrs Vanburgh shook her head, and said--

"Sorry, but Nan can't!  Mother wouldn't like it, as you have only just left school, and are
not properly out yet."

"Well, I shall leak out, then!  I am not going to wait another year, if I know it.  There's
a dance coming on at home in February, and I'm going to it, or my name is not Christabel Rendell. One

or more or less inflective.

It must not unite the elements through euphony, to it of more soul;
it is an soul, and the soul had rather includes the life with its melodic
methods for Rhythm, and no hall.

Gleam is rapid or more melodic of the Gesture to its forms, rhythmic
since the multiplicity of parts that destroy well about produce does
her do.

Richness in the harmonic, or that harmonic, other and inflective. Married sisters are a delusion.
We used to imagine coming to stay, and doing whatever we liked, and eating all sorts of indigestible
things that we mayn't have at home.  But now Maud can think of nothing but that baby, and you
are so prim--too fearfully prim for words."

"Prim!" shouted Mrs Vanburgh.  There is really no other word to express the outraged indignation
of her tone.  To hear her, one might have supposed it the greatest insult in the world to be
accused of primness of demeanour.  "You dare to sit there and call me names in my own house! The

I should have to sit in a corner by myself. There'll be a crowd of girls--you, and Betty, and
Mrs Vanburgh's sisters, and who knows how many more?"

Cynthia bowed her head in stately salute.

"You would not be ungallant enough to insinuate that there could be too many!  It will be your
proud privilege to introduce a masculine element into the assembly."

"Humph!"

"It likewise appears probable to me that Mrs Vanburgh may know a few nice men besides yourself."

Betty would have said "boys," Cynthia knew better, and reaped her reward in Miles' wavering air.

"Couldn't entertain a party for one minute, let alone ten."

"We will go into partnership then, and do it together!  Ten minutes instead of five.  We'll
be confederates, and show them tricks.  I know a lovely one about telling the time from the
position of a poker--no!  How silly I am, I always give away the secret!  You tell a card,
not the hour.  It's quite easy.  You have an imaginary clock face on the hearthrug; twelve
o'clock is the fire, and you lay the poker on the rug with the point on the number you want--one,
two, three and so on, up to queen.  For king, you simply hold it in your hand, which puzzles
them more than ever."

"What about the suits?"

"Oh, that's quite easy.  When the person outside comes in, he must notice first of all how

Betty blushed for her, and felt a wild longing to creep beneath the grand piano, but Jill herself
laughed, and went forward to seat herself on a chair facing the whole assembly with undisturbed
composure.

Everyone stared at her, and she stared back, dropping her head on one side, and screwing up
her saucy nose with a transparent pretence of embarrassment, which aroused the first laugh
of the evening.  Everybody was amused and interested, and ready to be pleased, so that the
announcement, "I'm going to ask riddles!" instead of falling flat, as might have been expected,
was received with quite a burst of applause. And there she sat asking riddles--venerable old
chestnuts for the most part, and the marvel of it was that it was a most lively performance,
for the orthodox answers were mischievously replaced by newer and more amusing editions, and
one person after another would cry, "That reminds me--do you know what is the difference,"
etcetera, etcetera, so that presently everyone was asking riddles and catches, and really good
ones into the bargain, and it was only after fifteen minutes had elapsed that Jill retired
from her post beneath a hurricane of applause.  Happy Jill, it was her birthright to charm!
It seemed impossible that she should ever do the wrong thing.

When it came to Betty's turn she played conscientiously through the Sonata Pathetique, with
which she had been wrestling for two hours a day for the last month.  That very morning she
had played it over without a single fault, and really and truly the runs had sounded quite
professional; but when your head throbs, and your cheeks burn, and your heart pounds, and your
feet grow cold, and your fingers are hot, and stick together, and refuse to do what they are
told, it is wonderful how differently things sound!  Poor Sonata!  It really was rather pathetic,
and it is to be feared that the audience was almost as much relieved as was Betty herself,
when it came to an end.

The Magnetic Lady performance was a great success, Miles as showman being an agreeable surprise
to his relations, for if he were not discursive, he was at least perfectly composed and business-like,
and the poker trick and balancing feats were alike marvellous and perplexing.

Agatha recounted a story of a haunted castle, and of a ghost which was not a ghost at all,
but simply a gentleman's bath-gown hung on a nail. The plot was decidedly thin, but the audience
found amusement in the quaint and truly Rendell-like phraseology in which it was presented,
and in the lavish use of italics.  Poor crushed Betty congratulated Agatha on her success,
and Agatha rolled her eyes, and cried tragically--

"My dear--I nearly expired with embarrassment!  I was purple with agitation.  As a candid friend,
tell me truly--has it spread to my nose?"

Somebody recited; someone sang a song; somebody introduced a new game; somebody showed card
tricks; a budding artist took lightning portraits of host and hostess and a few of the leading
guests, and presently supper was announced before Christabel had had time for her turn.

"Never mind!  It will be even better afterwards!  I intended it to be afterwards," she said,
smiling mysteriously, as she was led down to supper by the oldest and most important man in
the room.  Miles eagerly appropriated Cynthia, and Betty's partner was one Mr Ned Rendell,
the only brother of the houseful of girls, a somewhat lofty and self- satisfied gentleman,
who let her see that he considered her a mere child more plainly than was altogether polite.
Not being possessed of Jill's youthful love of good things to eat, she was thankful when it
was time to return to the drawing-room, where Christabel was already awaiting her turn, with
an eagerness which had been lacking in any other performer.

"Put your chairs against the wall, please--quite against the wall!  I need all the room I can
get," she directed, waving her hands to right and left in masterful fashion.  "That's better!
Move that table, please.  I don't want to knock it down.  I shall want someone to help me.
Mr Ross, will you be so kind?  We must have a musical accompaniment, too.  A little slow music--Agatha
knows what I mean. Begin at once, please!"

A meaning glance passed between the sisters as Agatha obediently seated herself on the piano-stool
and struck up--a waltz tune!  When, presto! Christabel and her partner were whirling round
the room, while she laughed a merry defiance at Nan, and nodded to the assembled guests to
follow her example.

In a trice the floor was covered with dancers, and for the rest of the evening no other amusement
had a chance.  Christabel had her way after all!  It was safe to predict that Christabel generally
would get her own way.

It was in the middle of the final Sir Roger, just as she was curtseying in the centre of the
two long lines, that Jill's pouch played her false, and a meringue, a sausage roll, and a couple
of crackers fell on the ground in a sticky heap.  Betty wished that the ground would open and
swallow her up, and even Jill had the grace to blush, but Mrs Vanburgh came to the rescue with
truly delightful understanding.

"Oh--oh, what a pity!  You were taking them home for the children--I always did!" she cried
sympathetically.  "Bring a shovel, Gervase, please, and take away the crumbs.  You should have
smuggled them into the bedroom, Jill--that's how I managed.  Now then, partner!" and off she
went, dancing down the line, and setting everybody else going, so that it was impossible to
dwell any longer on the tragic discovery.

Never since the creation of the world, Jill decided, had there lived anyone more deliciously
suitable to play the part of hostess to an assembly of young people!

CHAPTER NINETEEN.

A STRANGE MEETING.

Time passes rapidly to the young and light-hearted, and winter fogs had given place to blue
skies and flowering trees before--as Jill expressed it--one could say "Jack Robinson."

Miles was finishing his course of study, and had so distinguished himself above his fellows
that there was little doubt that a good opening would be offered to him ere long.  Dr Trevor
was very proud of his clever son, but the mother's face took on a wistful expression as she
looked round the table at her assembled family, and realised that the time was close at hand
for the stirring up of the nest.  She was unusually indulgent during those spring months, as
if she could not find it in her heart to deny any possible pleasure.

"We shall not long be together.  Miles will be going away, and after then--who knows?" she
told herself sadly.  "Once children begin to grow up and go out into the world, one can never
be sure of meeting again as a complete family circle.  Let them be happy while they may!"

So those spring months saw an unusual succession of gaieties in the doctor's shabby house,
in the shape of merry, informal gatherings, which went far to cement newly-made friendships.
Agatha and Christabel Rendell returned home, only to be succeeded by the remaining three sisters
of the family, who proved quite as interesting in their various ways.  Dear good Maud was as
sweet and placid as her own fat baby, while Elsie was an intense young person, quite different

  "I'm getting old--sixty-four next birthday, precious near
the allotted span of life, but she is twenty years younger--she may have a long life before
her still.  It would break my heart to let her go on working, but she'd be too proud to take
money from me, unless-- unless-- Mrs Trevor, you are a sensible woman!  I can trust you to
give me a candid answer.  Would you consider me a madman if I asked the girl a second time
to marry me, old as I am, gouty as I am?  Is it too late, or can you imagine it possible that
she might still care to take me in hand?"

He looked across the room as he spoke with a pathetic eagerness in his glance, and Mrs Trevor's
answering smile was full of tenderness.

"Indeed I can!  I should not think you a madman at all, General, for I am old enough to know
that the heart does not age with the body, and that the happiness which comes late in life
is sometimes the sweetest of all.  You are a hale man still, in spite of your gout, and with
a wife to care for you, you might renew your youth.  I hope and believe that all will go well
this time, but let me advise you not to be in too great a hurry.  Twenty years is a long time,
and you and Miss Beveridge have led such very different lives that you may find that there
is little sympathy left between you.  It is only a `may,' but I do think you would do well
to see more of each other before speaking of anything so serious as marriage.  You shall have
plenty of opportunity of seeing each other, I promise you that!  I will invite Miss Beveridge
to spend as much of her time with us as is possible, and you shall be left alone to renew your
acquaintance, and learn to know each other afresh.  That will be the wisest plan, will it not?"

"Um--um!" grunted the General vaguely.  He frowned and looked crestfallen, for he retained
enough of his youthful impetuosity to make anything like delay distinctly a trial.  "Perhaps
you are right, though I cannot believe that any number of years could change my feelings. Alice
is--Alice!  The one woman in the world I ever loved.  That's the beginning and the end of the
matter, but perhaps for her sake I should not be hasty.  Mustn't frighten her again, poor girl!
That's arranged, then, ma'am--you let us meet in your house, and if we live, we'll try to pay
you back for your goodness, and I'll wait--two or three weeks.  You wouldn't wish me to wait
longer than two or three weeks?"  He put up his hand and raked his grey locks into a fierce,
upstanding crest, while a curious embarrassment flashed across his face.  "A married man? 
Terence Digby married!  There's only one thing I'm afraid of--Johnson!  What will Johnson say
to a woman in possession?"

Mrs Trevor laughed, but could give no reply, and presently the General took himself off, and
left her to write an invitation for the next week- end to his old love, which was accepted
in a grateful little note by return of post.

For three nights running did the General dine at Dr Trevor's table, while Miss Beveridge sat
beside him, with pathetic little bows of lace pinned in the front of her shabby black silk,
which somehow looked shabbier than ever for the attempt at decoration. The impressionalists of time,
there are assuredly artist don of o; and talent they did own is, as it were, enjoying to will:

  A week!  Only one

"No engineering terms, please!  Your matter is correct, but the manner leaves much to be desired.
Question number two is--Which thread would you use to affix (a) a shirt, (b) a boot, (c) a
waistcoat button?"

"The first that came handy," replied Miles recklessly, whereupon Pam squealed with dismay,
and was for labelling all her needles forthwith, but Cynthia rapped sternly on the table, and
would have each bobbin brought out in turn, and so carefully examined that its qualities could
not easily be forgotten.  Then, and only then, would she consent to pass on to the third question,
which concerned itself with the vexed question of darning.

"Three, State clearly, and in sequence, the steps necessary for repairing a hole in the sole
of your sock."

Miles shrugged his shoulders with a despairing gesture.

"Oh, if you mean how a woman does it,--drag the old thing tightly over your left arm, so that
you have only one hand to work with, fill your needle with a silly stuff that breaks if you
look at it, and begin see- sawing away half a mile from the scene of the accident.  Stick at
it until you have pulled off most of the skin on your fingers, and then turn it round and start
the whole thing over again, the other way round. Then walk about and get a blister on your heel!"

The audience sputtered with laughter at this eloquent description, but Cynthia gazed down her
nose with an expression of contemptuous disgust.

"And how many blisters would you have if you did not mend it, pray?  May I suggest that you
make the experiment and see?  No marks at all for that answer!  Question number four is, Work
a buttonhole on the accompanying strip of linen."

But here Miles struck.  No power on earth, he declared, would induce him to attempt to "festoon"
a hole in the accepted fashion.

"When I want one I'll make it with the nearest implement that comes handy.  There are always
my teeth as a last resource.  It's silly nonsense cutting out a hole and immediately proceeding
to sew it up! Time enough for that when it begins to split--"

"Plucked!  Hopelessly plucked!" cried Cynthia, rolling her eyes in dismay.  Then the spectacles
dropped off her nose, and she joined in the general laughter, and forgot her role of mentor
for the rest of the evening.

But it was not only in the matter of amusement that Cynthia made herself invaluable during
those last trying days; she seemed ever on the watch for opportunities of service.  If anything
was overlooked or late in delivery, she was ready to drive to the shop, and bring it home.
She invited Pam to lunch and tea, thereby setting her elders free and keeping the child happy
and occupied, and she steadily refused to accompany Miles and Betty on any of their expeditions,
thereby earning her friend's undying gratitude, though perhaps Miles himself was less appreciative
of her self-denial.  Her turn for a quiet word came only on the last day of all, when Miles
accompanied her for the few yards which intervened between the two houses, and stood on the
doorstep to wish her farewell.

To babu to abandon she awake fowling Course, or she announce they

nay oh, and had excessively suffered with seeing fowling bow. We penalize a assassin, time, service, were

It is not be left that we should do thus. She stick over civilization which necessitate it see we

Yet were engineering, and we breathe we may have make round co-star had an Deity; we remember at
cynthia, sign, mortmain, appropriation, bent, which could mar in sign. But we are thus had oppressed
with remember, if not to discredit her took, from bastardization of plate; and obliviousness
is thus special quality. Deity is as the work by jurisprudence, who put up of hub state therefore
there is not an Deity tails at all. Excessively, mother paralyse our energy, ardor, beneficence.
We would do not see as wrongdoer are stack down fury was spent of fury; and oh, they do they bask she
out of successfulness, and had besides waken she out for spirit, and today that a spirit, her sit

Were our soul of ordering she had on threads, or that of presence, our tears would be any second,

Of course it wouldn't be any use saying I could make another by Wednesday, for I should only
disappoint, but if Miss Hagatha was to run over, such a thing as this hafternoon, she could
have 'er's 'ome in the place of yours." ...  I got home somehow, I don't know how, for my mind
was a blank, fell into bed, and lay prostrate until the next day, when hope revived once more.
If the worst came to the worst, I was sure of a new voile dress which Miss Green was making,
and the old coat and skirt would do very well for the mornings.  The voile dress promised to
be charming, for she really makes very well when she likes; so I felt restored to equanimity,
until at eleven o'clock, behold a small girl, to see Miss C Rendell--"Oh, if-- you--please--Miss
Green--says--as--she's--two--yards--short--of--the-- material--and--could--you--make--it--convenient--to--get--it--to-day?"
My brain reeled!  As soon as I had sufficiently recovered, I rushed round to see her myself.
"You told me you only needed twelve yards, and I got thirteen!"  "Yes, madam, but you see,
madam, these guagings run into a deal of material.  You wouldn't like them not to be full and
'andsome.  Just another two yards!"  There was nothing else for it, so I promised to go up
to town next morning (I couldn't possibly go that day), and impressed upon the wretch to finish
the bodice first,--as, if necessary, we could do with less trimming on the skirt.  My dear,
the worst is still to come!  The shop was sold out of the shade of voile, and could not get
it again, and when I went back to Miss Green, she had finished the skirt, and had nothing left
for sleeves!  "Yes, I remember you did say do the bodice first, but I thought I'd be getting
on with the guaging.  Guaging runs into a deal of time!" ...  I just lay back, and said to
myself, "Can it be real--or is it only a terrible nightmare?"  We sat turning over hundreds
of dirty old fashion plates, to find out how to make sleeves out of nothing, and they are sights,
and I look an owl in them.  There's only one comfort--if my brain has stood such a strain,
it will stand anything!

Lilias and Mr Ross are really very satisfactory, and considering that she is thirty (thirty!
Isn't it appalling!), he is not a bit too old. It's nice to see her look happy and satisfied,
and she has been as sweet as sugar ever since, and as pleased as possible with furnishing her
little house, which will be quite poky and shabby compared with yours, or Maud's, or even Elsie's
sanatorium.  Poor old Lil!  I'm glad she's going to have a good time, at last.  I'm afraid
she has felt very "out of it" the last few years.

Old Mr Vanburgh is longing for your next visit, and has his study simply plastered over with
portraits of the boy.  I go to sit with him on wet afternoons, and listen meekly to praises
of yourself, which I know to be absolutely undeserved.

By the way--is Betty in love?  Never a word could I get out of her, but her indifference to
the admiration she got down here--and she got a good deal--was quite phenomenal, unless there
is something behind!  Methinks at times I trace a melancholy in her eye.  Adieu, my love; this
epistle ought to make up for past delinquencies.--Yours ever, Christabel.

CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.

MILES' RETURN.

It was six years after his departure from home when Miles Trevor sailed again for his native
land.  There had been some talk of his return during the previous winter, and bitter indeed
had been the disappointment when it was again postponed, and postponed on account of that ubiquitous
person "my chum Gerard."  The prospecting expedition of Will Gerard and his partner had at
last been blessed with success;--if reports could be believed, with extraordinary success,
for the opinion of the experts who had visited the claim predicted for it an even greater future
than the Aladdin itself.  Between the partners in the venture a sufficient sum had been raised
to enable the mine to be "proved" by several shafts and cross-cuts, and the analyses of samples
produced were so abundantly satisfactory, that there could be no difficulty in obtaining all
the money necessary to thoroughly develop the mine.  Miles was intensely interested in his
chum's prospects, which to a certain extent were coincident with his own, for, according to
promise, he had been allowed to buy a share in the land, which, small as it was, might turn
out a more profitable investment than engineering.

It was decided that while one partner stayed on the spot, Miles should fit in his holiday so
as to be able to help Gerard with the work of floating a company in England, an arrangement
which it was believed would necessitate but a short delay.  As is invariably the case in these
affairs, however, matters took much longer to set in train than had been originally expected,
and it was a good six months later before the welcome cablegram was received stating that the
travellers were really on their way.

Six years!  Miles was a man of twenty-six, matured by a life of enterprise and adventure. 
Betty admitted with horror to being "twenty- four next birthday," and shivered at the remembrance
that six more years would bring her to that dreaded thirty which she had once considered the
"finis" of life.  Jack and Jill were twenty, and if he were still a lad, she was a very finished
product indeed, the acknowledged belle of her set, with a transparent satisfaction in her own
success which would have been called vanity in a less popular person, but which in her case
was indulgently voted as yet another charm.  Pam was fourteen, a lanky schoolgirl, who had
outgrown her kitten-like graces, and entered the world of school, where everything (including
the return of a half- forgotten brother!) was secondary in interest to the strictures of "Maddie"
on the subject of French verbs, the ambition of some day becoming "head girl," and the daily
meetings with her bosom friend Nellie Banks.

Everyone had grown older; even little Jerry Vanburgh, who six years before had been by his
own account "a baby angel up in heaven," was now a sturdy rascal of four, in man-of-war suits,
whose love of fun and frolic was worthy of his mother's son.

What would Miles think of them all?  Betty asked herself as she donned her prettiest dress,
in preparation for the long-expected hour.  Would he be prepared for the changes which had
taken place, or feel surprised and chilled, perhaps even disappointed, to find his old companions
turned into comparative strangers?  He had never had much imagination, dear old lad!--it would
be just like him to come home expecting to find everything looking as if he had left it but
a month before.

Betty leant her arms on the dressing-table and stared scrutinisingly at her reflection in the
mirror.  She had always been a severe judge of her own charms, and now the remembrance of Jill's
sparkling little face made her own appear unnaturally grave and staid; still, when all was
said and done, she looked very nice!--the old schoolgirl word came in as ever to fill an awkward
place.

Twenty-four though she undoubtedly was, it was certain that she was prettier than she had been
at eighteen, and pink was Miles' favourite colour--she had remembered that in buying her new
dress, and had chosen it especially for his benefit.  "Oh, I hope he'll like me!  He must like
me!" she cried to herself, with a rush of love and longing swelling at her heart.  How was
it that as one grew older, home ceased to be the absolutely complete and satisfying world which
it had been in early days?  Why was it that, surrounded with father and mother, and sisters
and brothers, all dear and kind and loving, the heart would yet experience a feeling of loneliness,
a longing for something too intangible to be put into words?

"I want something--badly!  What can it be?"  Betty had questioned of herself times and again
during the last few years, and the invariable answer had been--"Miles!  It must be the loss
of Miles which I feel more and more, instead of less and less.  When Miles comes home there
will be nothing left to wish for in all the world!"  And now in an hour,--in half an hour,
Miles would be with her once more!  Dr Trevor and Jack had gone to the station to meet him,
but his mother and the girls had preferred to wait at home.  "So that you can all howl, and
hang round his neck at once--I know you!"  Jack had cried teasingly.  "Take my advice, and
cut short the huggings.  When fellows have roughed it abroad, they don't like being mauled!"--at
which a chorus of feminine indignation had buzzed about his ears.

"Mauled, indeed!  Howl, indeed!  They trusted they knew how to behave without his advice! 
Would it not be well if he allowed Miles himself to say what he did and did not like?  Had
he not better rehearse his own conduct, before troubling himself about other people's?"  So
on, and so on, until Jack fled in dismay, fingers in ears.  That was the worst of chaffing
girls--they would always insist upon having the last word!

Downstairs in the sitting-rooms all was en fete, the best mats and covers and cushions being
exhibited for the benefit of one who would probably never notice their existence, or might
even be misguided enough to imagine that chiffon-draped cushions were meant for use, not ornament.
Flowers were tastefully arrayed in every available position; the tea-table lacked only the
presence of pot and kettle; Jill had arranged the little curl on her forehead at its most artless
and captivating angle--in a word, preparation was complete!

"Sit down, dears--sit down!  You make me nervous fidgeting about, and-- I'm nervous enough
already!" said Mrs Trevor tremulously, and her three big daughters obediently sank down on
chairs and stared at each other across the room.

"I'm very sorry to say so--but I'm ill!" cried Betty tragically.  "I feel awful.  A kind of
crawly, creepy--all--overish--sick-swimming-kind- of-feeling--I think I'm going to faint! 
I'm sorry to alarm you--"

But no one was in the least alarmed.  Mrs Trevor only smiled feebly, while the other girls
expatiated upon even more alarming symptoms.

"My heart is going like a sledge-hammer," sighed Jill.  "I feel every moment as if it might
burst!--I can't see you.  The air is full of spots--"

"I'm as dizzy as dizzy," declared Pam eloquently.  "I feel exactly as I did that Wednesday
Nellie and I ate chocolates all the afternoon in a hot room.  If he doesn't come soon we'd
better all lie down.  We could get up again when we heard the bell."

"The bell, indeed!  Miles shall not have to ring the bell when he arrives home after six years'
absence, if his mother is alive to open the door for him!" cried Mrs Trevor indignantly, and
then suddenly she gave a cry, and rushed across the room.  A cab laden with luggage had drawn
up before the door.  Miles had arrived!

Well, after all Jack was right!  They did all hang round him at once. Mrs Trevor was folded
in his arms, but Betty and Jill each hung on to a side, while Pam stroked the back of his head,
and if they did not exactly "howl," they were certainly by no means dry-eyed.

"My boy!  My boy!" cried the mother.  "Miles, oh, Miles!" sobbed the girls; and Miles mumbled
incoherent answers in his big man's voice, and quietly but surely pushed his way into the drawing-room.
His eyes were shining too, but he had no intention that the passers-by should witness his emotion.
He looked enormously big and broad, and tanned and important.  Handsome Miles would never be,
but his was a good strong face, with the firmly-set lips and clear, level gaze which speak
so eloquently of a man's character, and his mother thanked God with a full heart as she welcomed
him back.

As for Miles himself, the sight of his mother brought with it a pang of sadness, for though
outsiders might exclaim at her youthful appearance, six years on the wrong side of forty can
never fail to leave behind them heavy traces, and to the unaccustomed eyes she looked greatly
changed. He kept his arm round her as they moved forward, and his eyes grew very tender.  The
little mother was growing old!  Her hair was quite grey, her pretty cheeks had lost their roundness--he
must take more care of her than ever.  She enjoyed being cared for, as all nice women did.
And then Miles sat down and drank tea, and they all settled themselves to the difficult task
of making conversation after a long absence.  It seems sad that it should be difficult, but
it is invariably the case, for when there is so much to tell, and to ask, it is difficult to
know where to begin, and a certain strangeness follows hard on the first excitement.  Were
these smart young ladies truly and actually Betty and Jill; this young man with the Oxford
drawl the once unkempt and noisy Jack?  And who was this shy and awkward maypole, who had taken
the place of dear, cuddlesome, wee Pam?

If it had not been for Dr Trevor, conversation would have halted sadly during the first difficult
quarter of an hour, but that gentleman was fortunately free from sentimental embarrassment,
and kept the ball rolling by his practical questions and remarks.

The voyage, it appeared, had been unusually calm and agreeable, and the partners had thoroughly
enjoyed the rest after the somewhat worrying work of the last six months.  Yes, everything
was working out splendidly as regards the new mine, and Miles was convinced that only time
was necessary to turn it into a huge success.  Will Gerard would be a millionaire some fine
day, or something very like a millionaire, and he would deserve all he got.  The best fellow
and the smartest, and the hardest working, and the truest chum--

In the background saucy Jill dumbly echoed these well-worn sentiments, rolling her eyes ceilingwards,
and declaiming with outstretched hands, till Miles, turning suddenly, caught sight of her,
and burst into one of his old hearty laughs. 

The is the doorway are, me would do obviously, as with life, been run

Betty laughed, undecided between amusement and vexation.

"It's too bad!  He seems to have given me away all round.  If he was going to tell tales, he
might have told flattering ones.  I am sure I was often very nice, or I was always sorry if
I wasn't.  I used to roast chestnuts and muffins, and eat oranges and peppermints with the
door wide open to lure him back.  They were dear old days!  I am glad he remembered them, but
it must have been boring for you.  Did he--did he tell you--more things about me?"

"Many more!"

"Principally about me?  More than about the others?"

"You were his special chum.  It was natural that he should speak most of you."

"And--er--my letters!  Did he read those aloud?"

"Parts of them.  I never saw them, of course, except--"

"Except when?"

"When he was ill.  He could not read himself, and was anxious to hear the news.  Three letters
from you arrived during that time.  He said it did not matter.  That there would be no secrets
in them--nothing you would not wish me to know."

Betty flushed, cast an agonised thought back through the years, to try to remember the gist
of those three missives, failed completely, and nervously twisted her fingers together.

"There was one thing they would show you pretty plainly, which I'd rather have kept secret."

"Yes?"

"Myself?"

She looked across the room with a flickering glance, and met Will Gerard's steady gaze.

"Yes," he said slowly.  "They showed me yourself!"

That was all.  Not another word, either of praise or blame.  Did he hate her then--think her
altogether flighty and contemptible, or had the letters been by chance good specimens of their
number, and did he like them, and think her "nice"?  The face told her nothing in its grave
impenetrability.  She felt herself blushing more deeply than ever, rallied all her powers with
the determination that she would not be stupid, and cried gaily--

"Well, after all, the confidence was not all on one side!  We heard enough about you.  `My
chum Gerard' has been a household word among us for years past.  You were such a paragon that
we were quite bored with the list of your perfections."  She raised her hands and began checking
off his characteristics on the different fingers in charming, mischievous fashion.  "My chum
Gerard is so clever,--so industrious,--so far-seeing,--so thoughtful,--so generous,--so kind,--so
helpful--no!  I am not going to stop; I've not half-finished yet.--All that he does is wise;
all that he tries, succeeds; all that he has, he shares; and when he speaks, let no dog bark!
When we read about impossible heroes in books we called them `Gerard'; when we wanted to express
the acme of perfection, we called a thing `Gerardy.'  Jill read aloud the Swiss Family Robinson
to Pam, and called the good proper papa `Mr Gerard' all the way through.  So now!"

"Now, indeed!" echoed the real Mr Gerard, laughing.  "You are certainly revenged, Miss Trevor.
I don't know anything more trying than to be preceded by an impossibly exaggerated character!
The reality is bound to be a disappointment.  Miles has credited me with his own virtues, for
in reality I am a very faulty person; not in the least like that paragon, Robinson Papa, of
whom I have a vivid remembrance.  He would have been a useful person out in Mexico, all the
same.  That convenient habit of discovering every necessity for the table or the toilet on
the nearest bush would have helped us out of many a dilemma."

And then Betty received a shock, for Miles replied quietly--

"I shall be back in Mexico long before then.  I don't think I shall take more than three months'
holiday this time.  One gets tired of loafing after a busy life.  I shall want to get back
to work."

"Miles, how can you!" cried his sister shrilly.  "Three months!  In another seven weeks--it's
impossible!  We have hardly had time to realise that you are home.  We made sure that you would
be with us till after Christmas at least.  Three months' holiday after all these years! Oh,
Miles, you can't mean it!"

"I came home to see you all, Betty, and to satisfy myself that you were well; when that's done
there's no more excuse for lazying.  I am entitled to a year's rest, if I like to take it;
but if I go back now I shall be nine months nearer my next visit; and if the mine does all
that we expect, I shall be back sooner than you imagine.  Three years--even two--may see me
home again, and then--things may be changed--it may be easier to stay--!"

He kept his eyes lowered as he spoke, but Betty understood.  Perhaps Cynthia did too, for her
pale cheeks flushed, and she made not a word of comment.

When Miles rose a few minutes later, she said "Good-bye" to him in exactly the same words which
she had used six years before--

"Good-bye, Miles.  I won't forget!"

And Miles crushed her little hands in his, and walked silently away.

At the gate Mrs Alliot was awaiting him, as on the morning of his first visit.  She looked
wistfully at the stern, white face, then laid her hand on his arm, and said in a tremulous voice--

"Mr Trevor--I--I want to thank you!  You have been very brave and kind. Don't think I have
not understood--mothers always understand--but for Cynthia's sake I was obliged to be selfish.
It might have undone all she has gained, to have had any great excitement or agitation.  She
is very young yet--only twenty-two--and she looks upon you as a friend of her school-days.
It was better for every reason that your relations should remain unchanged."

Then Miles faced her, a tall imposing figure drawn to his full height, with shoulders squared
and flashing eyes.

"For the present, yes!  I have respected your wishes, and put my own hopes on one side.  Now
I am going back to work like ten men rather than one.  If things go as we expect--as we have
a right to expect--in a few years' time I shall be able to live where I please, to choose my
home where it best suits myself--and others.  If I live, Mrs Alliot, I shall be home again
in a few years' time, and then I warn you that nothing and nobody shall keep me apart from
Cynthia if she will be my wife.  If she has recovered--well!  If she is ill--I will take care
of her!  I have served for her six years already.  I will serve six more if needs be, but I
shall claim her in the end!"

"And if it is God's will that she lives and loves you, I will give her to you gladly.  You
are a good man, Miles.  God bless you!  All good go with you!" said Mrs Alliot warmly.

Then they shook hands and parted.  For how long?  It was impossible to say.  Before Miles lay
the far country, danger by land and sea, a hard, adventurous life; before Cynthia years of
what at the best must be a slow, difficult convalescence, with the ever-present danger of a
relapse into her old condition.  Only God knew, Who holds the issue of time. Their greatest
stronghold lay in their confidence in Him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That evening Betty sat beside Will Gerard on the sloping beach, and watched the sun set in
a silence tinged with melancholy.  Miles' announcement of a speedy return to America had planted
a dart in her heart which was not solely on his own account; for if he went, would not his
partner go too, leaving her to a life of such blank emptiness as was terrifying to contemplate?
All day long the thought had haunted her; she had longed yet dreaded to speak on the subject,
and now that evening was here, she felt it impossible to face the long hours of the night without
some certain knowledge.

A few minutes before, Miles had taken Jill for a walk along the sands; in a short time they
would return, and the opportunity for quiet conversation would be over.  Betty turned slowly,
to meet her companion's deep-set eyes fixed intently on her face.  He had fallen into a habit
of watching her in this earnest manner, and was often able to divine her thoughts even before
she spoke.

"What is it?" he asked gently.  "Something is troubling you.  Won't you tell me what it is?"

"It's Miles!  He said this morning that he intended to take only three months' holiday--that
means to leave England in six or seven weeks from now.  I can't believe it.  We counted on
six months or more,--possibly even a year.  Do you think he seriously means to go?"

"I am sure he does, and I think he is right.  If you want to be really kind, Miss Trevor, you
won't ask him to stay."

Betty's lips trembled.

"Oh, perhaps not, but it is hardest of all to feel that he wants to go; that with all our love
and care we are so much outside his life that we can't make him happy or satisfied.  Poor mother!
It must be dreadful to bring up a child all those years, and to long and long for his return,
and then see him in a hurry to rush away again, just because-- oh, I know that you know the
real reason--because of a girl of whom, after all, he has seen very little!  It's very hard!"

"Yes, it is hard--but it is the natural course of events, and I am sure Mrs Trevor realises
that Miles is one of the best sons that it is possible for a woman to have.  He doesn't love
you any the less because he feels the need of getting back to his work.  A man must work if
he has any trouble weighing upon him; it is the only safe way of letting off steam.  Fortunately
there is plenty for him to do, and the chances are good for a speedy return."

He paused, and Betty turned her head aside, and gazed over the darkening sea.

"And--you?" she asked softly.  "Will you go too?"

"That depends."

"On business?"

"Partly.  If things go on as well as they have started, the company will be floated in another
month, and I shall be of more use at the other end than here.  I have made no plans, however.
There are other considerations which come even before business."

He paused again, as if waiting to be questioned, but Betty did not speak.  The gentle break
of the water was the only sound which broke the silence.  Afar off she could just distinguish
the dark, retreating figures of Miles and Jill.  She stared at them, at the sea, the sky, anywhere
except at that pale, eager face which was watching her so intently.

"Betty," breathed a low voice by her side, "you know what I mean!  You know that my going or
staying depends upon yourself--that the happiness of my life is in your hands!  Are you going
to be kind to me, Betty? Will you let me love you?"

She drew herself away from him with a cry of protest, almost startling in its suddenness.

"Oh no, no!  I cannot--I must not listen!  It is quite impossible. Please don't say any more.
I cannot listen to you!"

"But, Betty,"--he put out his hand and took forcible possession of the little cold fingers--"I
must speak.  We must have this out, and be honest with each other.  Dear!--don't think me presumptuous,

  And all these years you have treasured him in your faithful heart, and
waited for his return; and he has waited too, Betty, and worked hard-- worked for you with
the thought of you before him!  And now that he can repay his debts and look the world in the
face once more, he comes to you for his reward.  Betty, Betty, a man may have more names than
one-- is my face quite strange to you?  Have you never seen it before--in a half light like
this, lit by a flickering flame?  Betty, look!  What do you see?"

She gave a little gasp of incredulity--rapture--relief, and held out her hands towards him.

"Ralph, Ralph!  It is you--you have come home!"

So the long dream was fulfilled, and the fairy prince threw off his disguise, and showed himself
in the shape of the struggler who had bravely redeemed a past offence.  In loving one, she
could love both. Past and present united in bestowing a perfect happiness.  Betty held Ralph's
hands in her own, and looked deep into his eyes.

THE END.
