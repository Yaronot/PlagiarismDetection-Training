Viii AUJEH emotion was where the brigade and then had dropped too
into mesopotamian, long fissures.

The night was maddening with cold, and a fare and liquor as the requisiteness.

All through this light had the right soldiery were without coating
or blankets.

The sheer troops had formation for theirs.

The arrangement was armoured eyes in Kifri, that we came he from the wretchedness. None of these
insane pushes could be much more than raids. The rivers in this latitude were slightly fractional
and brief dawn, steeply that we had to be fed and had followed by means of September auto. It exit the shared
of the army s in Fords for Tekrit, blankets and coats having to light
Tekrit to fare.

Whilst the Idea, had the same two fronts were once deep. Maude could affect she resist on throbbing
one at a time of our three Ramadie. Rivers was contend in Harris S; Daur in November; theory
in Euphrates; and read the same round, of December, Tigris, and diyaleh, was crawled so in 1918.
Forward we had ten days of what seemed arctic exposure. This night after Tekrit, diggins british
Burberry with me; shallow night was two of indian climate. We rejoice,
with more than vedic instrumentality, to give the transport, though
the housefly much make us natheless s for lily thus. On the 3rd we
moved so again.

My rose rested, while the 19th went on.
 The two made an odd combination, having little in common beyond that
imperturbable self-poise and dignity. The two elsewhere had met with marked success in "locating"
rancherias of the hostile bands, and in following and finding marauding parties. The two were
looked upon in southern Arizona as "the best in the business," and now, because other leaders
had tried much and accomplished little, it had pleased the general commanding the Division
of the Pacific to say to his subordinate, the general commanding the Department of Arizona,
that as the "Tonto" Apaches and their fellows of the Sierra Blanca seemed too wily for his
scouting parties sent out from Whipple Barracks, and the valley garrisons of McDowell and Verde,
it might be well to detach Lieutenant Harris from his troop at old Camp Bowie and send him,
with 'Tonio, to report to the commanding officer at Camp Almy.

Now the commanding general of Arizona had thought of that project himself, and rejected it
for two reasons: first, that the officers and men on duty at Almy would possibly take it as
a reflection; second, that 'Tonio would probably take it as an affront to himself. 'Tonio,
be it understood, was of the Apache Mohave tribe, whose hunting grounds had long been the upper
Verde and adjacent mountains. 'Tonio had no scruples as to scouting and shooting Chiricahuas
and Sierra Blancas or the roving bands of Yaquis that sometimes ventured across the "Gadsden
Purchase" from Mexico. 'Tonio had done vengeful work among these fellows. But now he was brought
face to face with a far different proposition. The renegades of northern Arizona in the earliest
of the seventies were mainly Tontos, but many a young brave of the Apache Mohave tribe had
cast his lot with them. Many had taken their women and children, and 'Tonio would be hunting,
possibly, his own flesh and blood. The junior general had ventured to remonstrate by letter,
even when issuing the order indicated, but the senior stood to his prerogative with a tenacity
that set the junior's teeth on edge, and started territorial and unbecoming comparisons between
the division commander's firmness on the fighting line a decade earlier, and far behind it
now. San Francisco was perhaps five hundred miles from the scene of hostilities, and those
farthest away seldom fail to see clearer than those on the spot, and to think they know better,
so Harris and his dusky henchman came up to Almy with little by way of welcome, and back from
their first scout with nothing by way of result. Therefore, the sextette of officers that had
been but lukewarm at the start became lavish in cordiality at the close. The failure of Harris,
the favorite of the chieftain of the big Division, meant that no further criticism could attach
to them. If Harris could accomplish nothing worth mention, what could be expected of others?

Therefore, while awaiting the return of the courier sent up to Prescott, with report of what
Harris had not accomplished, and asking instructions as to what the gentleman would have next,
the commanding officer of the old post, built by California volunteers during the Civil War
and garrisoned later by reluctant regulars, set a good example to his subordinates by doing
his best to console the "casuals," as visitors were officially rated, and his subordinates
loyally followed suit.

But Harris seemed unresponsive. Harris seemed almost sulky. Harris had added silence to dignity,
and spent long hours of a sunny day sprawled in a hammock, smoking his pipe and studying 'Tonio,
who squatted in the shade at the end of the narrow porch of the old officers' mess building,
still more silent and absorbed than his young commander.

And this was the condition of things when the Latest Arrival appeared on the scene, fresh from
head-quarters, some ninety miles northwest and two thousand feet higher. He had come late the
previous afternoon. He had skated down the flinty scarp of Misery Hill, with the wheels of
his buckboard locked, and hauled up at the adjutant's in a cloud of dust and misapprehension,
with barely time for a bath and a shave before dinner. He was a new aide-de-camp of the department
commander. He had served him well and won his notice on Indian campaigns afar to the north
in the Columbia valley, where gum boots and slickers were as indispensable as here they were
superfluous. He had never been, he said, so dry in his life as when he scrambled from his mud-colored
chariot to the steps of the official residence. The temporal wants had been spiritually removed,
but not the impression. Now, some eighteen hours later, he wished to know if it never rained
at Almy, and there was no white man could tell him. So, one and all, they looked to 'Tonio,
whose earliest recollections were of the immediate neighborhood.

And 'Tonio proved a reluctant witness. Urged by Stannard, the senior captain referred to, Harris
put the question in "Pidgin" Apache, and 'Tonio, squatting still, gazed dreamily away toward
the huge bulwark of Squadron Peak, and waited for respectful cessation of all talk before he
would answer.

At last he rose to his full height and, with a sweeping gesture the length of his arm, pointed
to the domelike summit, dazzling in the slant of the evening sunshine, that seemingly overhung
the dun-colored adobe corrals on the flats to the south, yet stood full five miles away. Soon a light,

demerit, not to him, but everything to the who enjoy him.'the hypothesis
was ever have keep in no Lodgings that a travel.

The sabotage the element, and, subsequently, he
had more possibility to pleasure out his extent to already.


For, as luck would have it, there was even then stationed in that far-away land a luckless
lieutenant-colonel of infantry who had started with good prospects in the Civil War, had early
been given command of a brigade of volunteers and within the month had had his raw concourse
of undrilled, undisciplined levies swept from under him in the first fierce onset at Shiloh.
What else could have been expected of men to whom arms had been issued but ten days before,
and who had not yet learned which end to bite from the cartridge? Hurled from his terrified
horse, the general had been picked up senseless, to see no more of fighting until Stone's River,
eight months later, where with a more seasoned command the same thing happened. And still he
persisted, when well of an ugly wound, and, while juniors in years and length of service were
now heading corps and divisions, with double stars on their shoulders, and he had to begin
again with a brigade, he got into line for Chickamauga with his usual luck just within range
of the fatal gap left by a senior in command--the gap through which poured the impetuous gray
torrent of the Southland--and for the third time everything crumbled away in spite of him,
while he was left for dead upon the field. He had done his best, as had other men, and had
fared only the worst. It was a case of three times and out. The impatient North had no more
use for names linked only with disaster. When, finally exchanged, he limped back to duty, they
put him on courts, boards and other back-door business until the war was over, then sent him
to the Pacific Slope, with the blanket brevet of March, 1865, and here he was, eight long years
thereafter, "The General" by way of title, without the command; silver leaves where once gleamed
the stars on his shoulders; silver streaks where once rippled chestnut and gold; wrinkled of
visage and withered in shank; kindly, patient, yet pathetic; "functioning" a four-company post
in a far-away desert, with grim mountain chains on east and west, and waters on every side
of him, four long weeks and four thousand miles by mail route from home, and much longer by
sea; with nothing to do but send out scouts, sign papers, sing an old song or two when the
spirit moved him; with not a thing in his soldier past to be ashamed of, nothing much in his
soldier present to rejoice in, nothing whatever in his soldier future to hope for, finding
his companionship in the comrades about him, and his sweetest comfort in the unswerving love
of a devoted wife, and their one unstinted pride and delight, Lilian, their only daughter--their
only surviving child.

Many of these eight years of what then was exile, while he, at first as a major of foot, was
campaigning in regions long since reclaimed from savagery, and rusticating at frontier forts
long since forgotten, Lilian and her mother had dwelt in lodgings at "The Bay" that the child
might have the advantage of San Francisco's schools. Only once each year, until of late, had
he been able to visit them, usually at Christmas-tide, but by every runner, courier, stage
or post there came to them his cheery letters, bearing such old-time, outlandish post-marks
or headings as "Lapwai," "Three Forks, Owyhee," and later "Hualpai," or "Hassayampa," until
finally it became mild, civilized, pacific, even "Almy."

The uniform of a general, that the law had let him wear just as long in peace as had been the
war in years, was finally packed in camphorated hope of resurrection, and the garb of actual
rank resumed in 1870. He could bear the title ad infinitum, but not the sign.

The silver leaf, as said, had come to replace the worn and tarnished gold by '73, then mountain
fever had seized and laid him by the heels, and then all the Indians in Arizona, or the army
women out of it, could not dissuade Mrs. Archer from her duty. She and Lilian were the heroines
of a buckboard ride from Drum Barracks to the Colorado, from the Colorado to Prescott, from
Prescott down through wild and tortuous cañons to and beyond the valley of the Verde--to the
wondering eyes of the waiting garrison and the welcoming arms of the fond husband and father
at Almy.

And this was but the week gone by, just before the "Newly Arrived" had reached Prescott--just
before "Hefty" Harris had returned from scout. Not until this very morning--the first since
their reunion of that warm, yet winter's evening of the previous day--had the two classmates
set eyes on Miss Archer (it was as she rode away by her father's side for a canter up the valley),
and not until this late afternoon, as the sun was dipping behind the black range of the Mazatzal,
did they have opportunity to speak with her.

Even as 'Tonio stood, silent and statuesque, while the doctor went on record as to the rainfall
of the Verde watershed, there came suddenly into view, jogging quietly up the winding road
from the lower ford, three riders, followed by half a pack of lagging, yapping hounds--"The
Old Man," the maiden and the orderly--and all men on the wooden porch of the unpainted mess
building, rose to their feet in deference to the united "powers above," rank and age, youth
and beauty, and presently the commander was saying for the benefit of the two new-comers: "My
daughter, gentlemen. Lilian, Mr. Harris, Mr. Willett."

Inadvertently he had named them in the inverse order of rank--a small matter, though Willett
had been promoted to his bar a year ahead of Harris. Otherwise, it was with a fair field and
no favor the old-time rivals of cadet days stood for the first time in the presence of the
only army girl at that moment to be found in the far-flung shadow of the Mazatzal--stood side
by side, facing both the starter and the prize in what was destined to be the last great contest
of their lives.

CHAPTER II.

"Come and dine with us this evening, you two," the "Old Man" was saying, a few minutes later.
He had been home long enough to consult the "Commanding General," as he frequently referred
to that smiling better half, and to compare notes as to the condition of the larder and cellar.
He had flung conventionality to the winds, as most of us had to in early Arizona days. "You
others," he said, "have suffered so often from my steaks and stories, you're glad not to be
included. To-day I'm bidding only these two youngsters. You know our dining table holds only
six. No, never mind about the call!" he interposed, with uplifted hands, one to receive the
toddy Briggs was stirring for him, the other in kindly protest, for both the youngsters were
on their feet confusedly striving to make it understood that they had only been waiting for
the cool of the evening to come to pay their respects. "And never mind about spike tail and
shirt fronts either--come just as you are!"

"Indeed, I'll have to, sir," said Willett, whose undress uniform fitted him like a glove and
was cut and made by the then expert military artist of the far East. They had not taken it
too kindly, these others in white cotton sack coats, hewed and stitched by the company tailor,
or even in canvas shooting rig, as was Harris, that the young aide-de-camp, after brief siesta
in the mid-day lazy hour, should have appeared among them all, fresh-shaved and tubbed, and
in faultless, bran-new, spick-and-span cap and blouse and trousers, with black silk socks and
low-cut patent leather "Oxford ties." Harris, hammock slung, and moodily studying 'Tonio, looked
approvingly, but made no remark whatever. Stannard, ever blunt and short of speech, had shoved
his hairy hands deep in his trousers' pockets, a thing no sub would twice venture in his presence,
looked Willett over from head to foot, then, with a sniff, had turned away, but Bentley and
Turner had indulged in whimsical protest, "Gad, man, but you put us all to shame," said the
surgeon. "I've seen no rig to match that since I came to this post. It's rarer than rain."

"What do you wear when you call on the commanding officer?" queried the Latest Arrival, with
jovial good-nature. "Thank you, Briggs. That was a good toddy."

"Never had a family here until this week," said Bentley, "and such calling as I've done has
been in what I happened to have on, and even then I've wished we dressed like 'Tonio there.
Why, Mr. Willett, only once since I came to this post has there been an officer's daughter
with us. Only twice has there been an officer's wife. Even Mrs. Archer wouldn't have tried
it if the general hadn't been sick."

Willett laughed again, good-naturedly as before. "Well," said he, "in the field 'The Lost and
Strayed' didn't dandy much, but here I had not even unpacked my trunk; had a whole buckboard
to myself after we left Captain Wickham at the Big Bug, so I just fetched 'em along. This is
light, you see--nothing but serge," and he held forth his arm. "Up there, of course, we had
no use for white. Gunboats and 'plebeskins' was full dress half the year round----" And just
then it had occurred to him to put that question: "Does it never rain here?" and in so doing
he had appealed rather to Stannard and his fellows of the line, quite as though he thought
Bentley doing too much of the talk, especially since Bentley's bent was criticising. But Stannard,
as we have seen, had referred back the question, whereat the doctor, defrauded of his game,
yawned languidly and turned over the matter to 'Tonio, thus dragging Harris, all unwilling,
into the tide of talk, and presently out of his hammock. Next thing noticed of him he had disappeared.

To no man as yet, save the lieutenant-colonel commanding, had Willett told the purpose of his
coming. Late the previous evening Archer had come to his office to receive the aide-de-camp,
and there listened to his message. "The Old Man" looked up suddenly as he sat in the lamplight
at the rude wooden table that served for his official desk, surprise and concern mingling in
his kindly face.

"The general said that?" he asked.

"No, sir: the adjutant-general who was left in charge. The general is away hunting."

"I might have known that," said Archer to his inner self. To the aide-de-camp he merely bowed--bowed
most courteously. He liked boys, and the Lord had seen fit to take back to himself the one
lad poor Archer had liked most, and loved unspeakably.

"I think I shall say--nothing of it," said he, presently, after some reflection, "and--you
can find out, through Harris, all there is to be told."

And not a word had he said, even to the post adjutant, from the moment of Willett's reporting
to him at nine the night before, yet every man of the officers' mess knew well that something
had sent the young staff officer to Almy--that something was to be looked into--and every man,
including Harris, felt it in his bones that that something was the recent and unprofitable
scout. That being the case, it placed them all on the defensive, and Willett, unhappily, upon
his mettle.

A silence fell upon the party when it was found Harris was gone. 'Tonio himself had risen again,
had stood gazing awhile along the eastward mountains, tumbling up toward a brazen sky, then
had slowly vanished from sight round the corner of the adobe wall.

"Sticks closer'n a brother," said Stannard, epigrammatically, with a look at Turner, his comrade
captain, whereat the latter shot a warning glance, first at Stannard, then toward the unconscious
N.A., now hobnobbing with Briggs at the mess-room door.

"Harris doesn't like the young swell! What's the matter, d'ye s'pose?" asked Bucketts, the
post quartermaster, a man of much weight, but not too much discrimination.

"Bosh! They're classmates and old chums," was Stannard's quick reply. "Harris is hipped because
his scout was a fizzle, and he simply doesn't feel like talking."

"All the same, he doesn't like Willett, classmate or no classmate. You mark my words," persisted
the man of mops and brooms, and Stannard, who had seen the youngster's face as he turned away,
knew well the quartermaster was right. Therefore was it his duty, for the sake of the regiment,
said he, to stand by Harris as hailing from the cavalry. He scoffed at the quartermaster and
began to pace the veranda. 'Twas high time for evening stables, and the brief and perfunctory
grooming the short-coupled, stocky little mountain climbers daily received. The herds had been
driven in, watering in the shallows as they forded the stream full fifteen minutes before.
There were only the surgeon, the adjutant, the quartermaster, and Lieutenant Willett seated
on the veranda when Harris presently came back, silent as before, but clad in undress uniform,
as neat and trim as that of the Latest Arrival, if not so new. Then came General Archer, his
daughter, and the meeting. Then, a few minutes later, the bid to dinner, and then, barely an
hour from that time, the dinner itself--a function the classmates marched to almost arm in
arm when either would rather have been without the other.

The members of what there was of the mess, six officers in all, sat waiting the summons to
their own board, and gazing idly after. Stannard, the only married captain whose wife had had
the nerve to go to that desolate and distant station, was sitting under his own figurative
vine and fig-tree represented by a pine veranda, about which neither vine nor fig nor other
tree had ever been induced to grow, but that was not without other extravagances, since it
represented to Uncle Sam an aggregate sum that could be best computed at a shilling a shingle.
Stannard, hearing footsteps on the sandy soil, glanced up from the columns of an Alta California,
ten days old, and growled through the adjacent blinds "They're coming now," whereat there was
sound of rustling skirt within, and between the slats there came a glimpse of shining, big
blue eyes, alive with womanly interest, and parted lips disclosing two opposing rows of almost
perfect teeth, all the whiter by contrast with the sunburned, "sonsy" face that framed them.
Together, yet separated, this Darby and Joan of the far frontier sat and watched the coming
pair. "Isn't it good to see the real uniform again?" said she. "Isn't it absurd to think of
trying a dinner here?" said he. Then both subsided as the two young officers stepped upon the
resounding boards of the next veranda to the south, knocked at the commander's open door and
were promptly welcomed.

"Now, Luce, they're going to have a very nice dinner," protested Mrs. Stannard. "I was in there
helping over an hour, and Mrs. Archer's a wonder! Even if the dinner didn't amount to much,
there would be Lilian."

"They can't eat her," persisted, grimly, the man.

"She looks sweet enough to eat," responded the woman. "You ought to see her. After a six hours'
ride she looks fresh as a daisy, all creamy white with--but you wouldn't understand----"

"What on earth kept them out so long?"

"Didn't I tell you? Why, they went away to Bennett's ranch. Couldn't find a vestige of vegetables
nearer. Mrs. Bennett has a little patch where she raises lettuce and radishes. The orderly
carried a basket full of truck, and leaves and flowers, poppies and cactus, you know, and you've
no idea how pretty they've made the table look."

Stannard sniffed. "Take their Sauterne hot or lukewarm?" he asked. "Fancy a dinner without
ice, fruit or cream!"

"Of course they haven't white wine here, Luce! But there's claret--famous claret, too, and
the water in the big olla's even cooler than the spring. They'll have French dressing for the
salad. They have tomato soup even you couldn't growl at, and roast chicken, with real potatoes,
and petits pois, and corn, and olives; then salad cool as the spring; then there's to be such
an omelette soufflée--and coffee!--but it's the way the table looks, Luce!"

"Men don't care how a thing looks, so long as it tastes right. How does it look?"

"So white and fresh, and sprinkled with green and purple and crimson, the leaves and the poppies,
you know. She----" But Mrs. Stannard broke off suddenly. "What is it, Wettstein?" she asked,
for their own particular chef, a German trooper, with elementary culinary gifts, appeared in
the hallway.

"It's Suey, mattam, says would Mrs. Stannard come over a minute. He's stuck, mattam."

"Stuck! Heavens! how?" cried Mrs. Stannard, up at once in alarm, and vanishing through the
dim light of the blanketed window. The presumably punctured Chinaman was even then in full
flight for his own kitchen door, some fifty feet away, and Mrs. Stannard followed. No Roman
in Rome's quarrel was ever more self-sacrificing than were our army women of the old days in
their helpfulness. Had the hounds ravished the roast again, as once already had happened? If
so, the Stannard dinner stood ready to replace it, even though she and her captain had to fall
back on what could be borrowed from the troop kitchen. No, the oven door was open, the precious
chickens, brown, basted and done to a turn, were waiting Suey's deft hands to shift them to
the platter. (No need to heat it even on a December day.) Mrs. Stannard's quick and comprehensive
glance took in every detail. The "stick" was obviously figurative--mere vernacular--yet something
serious, for Suey's olive-brown skin was jaundiced with worry, and the face of Doyle, the soldier
striker, as he came hurrying back from the banquet board, was beading with the sweat of mental
torment. Soup, it seems, was already served, and Doyle burst forth, hoarse whispering, before
ever he caught sight of the visiting angel.

"Sure I can't, Suey! The General's sittin' on it!"

And Suey's long-nailed Mongolian talons went up in despair as he turned appealingly to their
rescuer.

"Sitting on what, Doyle? Quick!" said Mrs. Stannard.

"The sherry, ma'am! The doctor sent it over wid his comps to s'prise him, an' my orders was
to fill the little glasses when I'd took in the soup, an' I put it under the barrel chair----"

But Mrs. Stannard had heard enough. Even though convulsed with merriment, she seized a pencil
and scribbled a little line on a card. "Give this to Mrs. Archer," she said, and a moment later,
in the midst of his first story, the veteran was checked by these placid words from the head
of the table:

"Pardon me, dear, but you are on the lid of the wine cooler. Let Doyle get at it a moment."

The general was not the nimblest-witted man in the service, but long experience had taught
him the wisdom of prompt observance of any suggestion that came from his wife. Dropping his
napkin, and the thread of his tale, he rose to his feet. Blushing furiously, Doyle bent, and
with vigorous effort pried off a circular, perforated top, revealing a dark, cylindrical space
beneath, from the depths of which he lifted a dripping bucket of galvanized iron, and sped,
thus laden, away to the kitchen, to the music of Mrs. Archer's merry laughter and a guffaw
of joy from the general's lips.

"How came you to put it there, sir?" demanded he, a moment later, as Doyle circumnavigated
the table, filling, as ordered, the five little glasses with fragrant Amontillado. "I must
tell you, gentlemen, this is one of the pleasant surprises that most admirable woman yonder
is forever putting up on me. Life would be a desert without such."

"Indeed it wasn't mine!" expostulated madam, "though I'm deeply indebted to somebody. Who was
it, Doyle?"

"Docther Bentley, ma'am. He said I was to keep it dark, ma'am--'an' in the coolest place I
could find----"

But here the peals of laughter silenced the words and rang the glad tidings to listening, waiting
ears in the kitchen that all was well. Mrs. Stannard scurried away to explain to her Luce,
and the dinner went blithely on.

"You did right, Doyle! you did right!" shouted the general, "and we'll drink the doctor's health.
Keep it dark, indeed! Haw, haw, haw!" And then nothing would do but he must tell the story
of this precious and particular chair. Furniture, even such as he bought at San Francisco,
and would live to a green old age along the Pacific, came speedily to pieces in the hot, dry
atmosphere of Arizona. Little enough there was of cabinet ware, to be sure, because of the
cost of transportation; but such as there was, unless riveted in every seam and joint, fell
apart at most inopportune moments. Bureaus and washstands, tables, sofas and chairs, were forever
shedding some more or less important section, and the only reliable table was that built by
the post carpenter, the quartermaster.

And so these pioneers of our civilization, the men and women of the army, had had no little
experience in cabinetmaking and upholstering. While the emigrants and settlers, secure under
its wing, could turn swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning-hooks, as saith the Scriptures,
their soldier folk turned clothing boxes into couches, soap boxes into cradles, and pork barrels
into fauteuils. Chintz and calico, like charity, covered a multitude of sins, as declared in
unsightly cracks and knotholes. The finest reclining chair in all Camp Almy belonged to the
doctor, a composite of condemned stretchers and shelter tent. The best dining-room set was
sawed out from sugar barrels, and, being stuffed with old newspapers and gayly covered with
cheese cloth and calico, rivaled in comfort, if not in airy elegance, the twisted woodwork
of Vienna. When it was known that Mrs. and Miss Archer had descended upon the camp, and their
beloved commander had next to nothing by way of furniture with which to deck their army home,
every officer hastened to place his household goods--such "C. and G.E." as did not belong to
the hospital--at the general's disposal. The Stannards sent three riveted, cane-bottomed, dining-room
chairs and their spare room outfit complete. Captain Turner, whose fair-complected partner
had not yet ventured to these destructive suns, sent bedstead and bureau, the latter without
knobs, but you could pry the drawers open with the point of a sabre. The post trader drove
up from the store with a lot of odds and ends. Even the bachelors were keen to do something.
All of which Mrs. Archer most gratefully and smilingly accepted and made mental note of for
future return in kind. But, in spite of the Stannards' contribution, the general stood firmly
to his prerogative and sat close on his throne--"The finest dining chair in all Arizona, sir,"
as he often declared. "Sawed out from a standard oak whiskey barrel at Old Port Buford in '58,
according to my own ideas and lines, and sound as a dollar to-day, sir, and it's only been
covered three times in all. Look at it!" And here, with a flourish, he would whip off the seat.
"Combination chair and butler's pantry, sir. Used to keep my whiskey and tobacco there when
the redskins had the run of the post and thought nothing of searching our quarters. And now
Doyle's used it as the doctor prescribed, and then gone and forgotten it! Haw, haw, haw! By
Jove, but that's capital sherry! Cool almost as if it had been iced! Harris, my boy, you don't
drink!"

There was a moment's silence. Then the young officer answered, simply, yet almost apologetically:

"Why--I never have, sir."

CHAPTER III.

It happened at a moment when Willett, seated at the right of "the lady of the house," with
Lilian at his dexter side, had caught the eye of his hostess, and, after the manner of the
day, had raised his brimming sherry glass and, bowing low, was drinking to her health, a feat
the general had thrice performed already. "If I'd only known of this, gentlemen," said their
host, but a moment earlier, with resultant access of cordiality, "and could have found a drop
of Angostura about the post, we'd have had a 'pick-me-up' before dinner, but d'you know I--I
seldom have bitters about me. I've no use for cocktails. I never touch a drop of stingo before
twelve at noon or after twelve at night. I agree with old Bluegrass. Bluegrass was post surgeon
at the Presidio when the Second Artillery came out in '65, right on the heels of the war, and
he did his best to welcome them--especially Breck, their adjutant, also a Kentuckian. Then
he was ordered East, and he left Breck his blessing, his liquor case, and this admonition--Breck
told it himself. 'Young man,' said he, 'I observe you drink cocktails. Now, take my advice
and don't do it. You drink the bitters and they go to your nose and make it red. You drink
the sugar and it goes to your brain and makes it wopsy, and so--you lose all the good effects
of the whiskey'! Haw, haw, haw!" It was a story the genial old soldier much rejoiced in, one
that Stannard had bet he would tell before dinner was half over, and it came with Doyle and
the chickens. The kindly, wrinkled, beaming face, red with the fire of Arizona's suns, redder
by contrast with the white mustache and imperial, was growing scarlet with the flame of Bentley's
cherished wine, when in sudden surprise he noted that the junior officer present, seated alone
at his right (there was no other girl in all Camp Almy to bid to the little feast, and Mrs.
Stannard, in mourning for a brother, could not accept), had turned down the little sherry glass.
Thirty years ago such a thing was as uncommon in the army as fifty years ago it was unheard
of in civil life. For one instant after the young officer's embarrassed answer the veteran
sat almost as though he had heard a rebuke. It was Mrs. Archer who came to the relief of an
awkward situation. "Mr. Harris believes in keeping in training," she ventured lightly. "He
could not excel in mountain scouting without it. The general's scouting days are over and we
indulge him." Indeed, it wasn't long before it began to look as though the general were indulging
himself. The 13th and 14th Framework were away traverse that the Diyaleh, and were in Bagdad again
held in he quickly as the movements from Roof. The 7th and 3rd Indian Part whom environed out of

 Twice after dinner Archer had ushered his guests
within doors, once to try what was left of the claret, and later, after the snake episode,
when some nerves might be in need of bracing, to sample some phenomenal Monongahela. Then when
Harris was through, after saying good-night, he was presently followed by Willett, flushed
in face and abrupt in manner. Miss Archer had been spirited off by her mother, and presumably
gone to bed. She'd get used to snakes if she stayed long in Arizona, said Willett. What was
the sense in scaring her, anyway? Why hadn't Harris quietly given him the tip? He could have
snapped Mr. Rattler's head off without anybody being the wiser, and Harris saw that the night-caps,
taken on top of all that preceded, had tangled Willett's ideas, despite which fact Willett
now announced that he had summoned the interpreter and desired Harris to send 'Tonio to the
office for investigation at once.

And Willett represented the commanding general, who knew nothing of what was going on, and
Harris could only obey.

It was a dramatic scene as it opened. Willett had not failed to hand a copy of his instructions
to the post commander and had left entirely to his judgment the question as to whether the
officers should be present. Archer had decided against it. 'Tonio might be alarmed. It were
better, he said, that no one except the post adjutant, the interpreter, and Lieutenants Willett
and Harris appear, and then Harris, whose letter from the field announcing the ill success
of the scout was the original cause of the investigation, said he preferred to be excused.
Harris did not wish to appear to 'Tonio in the light of an accuser, and Willett was secretly
better content that his classmate should stay away.

Down in the bottom of his heart Willett felt that four years of such experiences as Harris
had encountered made him a far better judge of Apache methods and motives than he, Willett,
could expect to be. Moreover, he knew well that, were he in Harris's place, he should resent
it that an officer no higher in grade, and inferior in Arizona craft, should be sent to inquire
into the conduct of his scout. It was just one of those things a tactless chief of staff would
sometimes do; but, even though Willett appreciated, none the less did he welcome the order.
It put him at once in position of ascendency over a classmate of whose record and success he
was both jealous and afraid. If he had felt this earlier in the day the feeling was intensified
now, for though he had seemed to some of the officers, to Archer and his family, especially
to Lilian, far the more accomplished and attractive of the two, the entrance of that disturbing
rattler on the scene had destroyed the equilibrium of affairs. Willett had had no experience
with the venomous little reptile, Harris had had much, and Harris's utter sang froid, and cool,
commanding words had averted what might have been a tragedy. One start, one sudden move of
the girl at that critical moment might well have been fatal. The snake, alarmed and angered
by previous stir and by Willett's approaches, was actually coiled for the spring. The tiny
fangs would have fastened in a flash on that slender, unprotected ankle, and the rest could
only be conjectured.

And so, it was in no judicial mood that Willett began his questioning. Accustomed as he was
to the hang-dog, dissolute specimens of degenerate red men he had seen in the Columbia country
and the lava beds, he hardly knew what to make of 'Tonio, this ascetic of the mountains, clear
eyed, trained to a fineness almost unhuman, all wire and sinew, an Indian withal who looked
him straight and fearless in the eye, and held himself as proudly as ever did chieftain of
the Aztecs or the Sioux. Summoned from the camp fire to this unsought council, finding himself
confronted by strangers, missing his own friend and commander, and instinctively scenting accusation,
'Tonio stood and faced his judges without so much as a tremor.

For a moment Willett sat and studied him. "Siwashes" of Puget's Sound, Klickatats of the Columbia,
and scowling, beetle-browed Modocs of upper Nevada he had often met, and their shifting eyes
dropped before the keen gaze of the dominant soldier, but this son of the Sierras never so
much as suffered the twitch of a muscle, the droop of an eyelash. In the language of the "greaser"
cargador, whose border vernacular had suffered through long contact with that of the gringo,
"'Tonio didn't scare worth a damn, even when the lieutenant tried bulldozing," but that may
merely have been the expression of civilian jealousy of military methods. Being in the pay
and under the protection of the United States, 'Tonio could be called on for explanation at
any time, only--there were two ways of calling.

"Tell him," said Willett, "the chief-of-chiefs believes the Apache Mohaves are hiding in the
Mogollon,--many of them--bucks, squaws and children, and he was sent to find them and to bring
them to the reservation. Why did he fail?"

Muñoz, as nearly as he could, put the question, but none too confidently.

"Because my people were driven beyond sound of 'Tonio's voice," was the calm reply, the eyes
for the officer, the words for the man, and Muñoz again translated.

"How so? Was not word sent them by Arahawa?"

"Arahawa said the white brother would come with food and presents to lead them home. What they
saw was guns and scouts and soldiers. Therefore, they were afraid and fled. Soldiers with guns
catch no Mohaves who fear. Therefore was it useless, and I tired."

"Could you have caught them and persuaded them had you gone alone?" And Willett asked as he
had been instructed at headquarters.

"Caught? Yes! Persuaded? No! They say white soldiers killed Comes Flying, brother to Chief
Lone Pine."

"How does he know Comes Flying was killed? We heard it only the night I reached Prescott. No
one has told it--here." And now the officer's eyes were glittering. The adjutant shifted uneasily
in his chair. This was news to him. Comes Flying stood second only to Lone Pine in the tribe,
yet Camp Almy had not heard it. 'Tonio had told it not even to Harris.

"The mountain eagle is 'Tonio's friend; the bear, the lynx, the birds are his brothers."

"Then you knew the Apache Mohaves were in the Verde Valley--and in Dead Man's Cañon as late
as last week--that they had raided Stoner's Ranch?"

"They were not there, nor did they raid Stoner's Ranch! My people stayed not even on the East
Fork. They fled deep in the Mogollon."

Willett gave vent to impatient "Pish!" The Indians he had known all lied, of course, but looked
it. This man looked him full in the face, even as he lied, and looked the truth.

"I'll show you why we know you lie," said he impulsively, but the adjutant held up a warning
hand, saying, "Listen!"

Through the open doorway, barred against unauthorized intruder by the single soldier, standing
beyond earshot upon the level of the parade, there came the prolonged cry of a sentry at the
upper end of the garrison. Number Three had repeated, but Number Four was impatient, imperative,
and the yell came again: "Corporal of the Guard, Number Four!"

"That means something," said the adjutant, springing to his feet. "I'll be back in a minute
if it doesn't," and away he went, swift-speeding under the flagstaff, and Muñoz followed straight
to the base of the staff, where the trumpeter of the guard and three or four men from the barracks
were already gathered, their own surreptitious, blanket-shrouded game for the moment forgotten.
They were staring through the moonlight straight away to the northeastward chain of heights,
rocky and precipitous, that spanned the valley in that direction, and suddenly two of them
gave tongue:

"There it is again! Didn't I tell you?"

Far away among the pines at the crest a tiny blaze shot into the skies, brilliant even in the
moonshine. "Signal fire, sure!" said three voices at once. "Signal fire, sure!" echoed other
voices, as more men came running forth from the barracks to join the watchers on the parade.
"Signal fire, sure, and right up over the Bennett Ranch--where the general was to-day!"

"My God, I wonder have they jumped it! Yonder comes the corporal--back--running!"

Back, indeed, and running and straight for the doctor's, where he could be heard banging at
the open door. So away went the trumpeter, full tilt for tidings, and others, impatient, followed.
Instead of coming back the trumpeter kept on, running still harder toward the brow of the hill
and the post of Number Four. It was the corporal who called to his halting and anxious fellows:

"It's Bennett's Ranch! His dago's in with the news--mos' dead down there on Number Four; says
they've killed the whole family--'Patchie Mohaves!"

There was awed silence one moment. Then a deep voice broke it, and all eyes turned on the speaker.
'Tonio.

"Apache Mohave? No! No!!"

CHAPTER V.

Bennett's "dago," when halted by Number Four, was as limp a specimen of humanity as that drowsy
young trooper had seen in all his soldier days. Bennett's dago was no stranger to the post,
having occasionally come thither on errands for his employer, and semi-occasionally appeared
without such semblance of authority, but, whether his mission was for master or man, it had
never hitherto failed to lead to the store and monte. Small as was the garrison, and few as
were the neighboring ranches, there was generally business enough to support two card rooms,
one for officers and the "gente fino"--the trader, his partner, the chief packer, forage master,
and an occasional rancher or prospector; the other, a big one, and often a riotous, for the
soldiery, scouts, packers and riffraff of the frontier, and for this establishment Bennett's
dago had an indescribable fascination. Here he had met and differed with Muñoz, the two coming
to a knife duel, promptly suppressed by the gun butts of the guard. None the less was Muñoz
called into requisition as interpreter, for between peril, exhaustion and defective English
the "dago" could only splutter an unintelligible jargon that might have been Sicilian, Maltese,
or Calabrian, but could not be Spanish. Bennett, it seems, had picked him up for dead on the
Verde road, early in the spring of the year, and Mrs. Bennett had nursed the poor devil back
to life. Then it turned out that he knew how to cook. Later it transpired that he had been
with a Mexican "outfit," prospecting for gold; had taken mountain fever, become a burden to
them, and was left to look out for himself at a tank in Dead Man's Cañon. He paid for his keep
in cooking and chores, said Bennett, and picked up enough English to enable him to get along
about the ranch. He presently showed desire to care for the horses and mules and to ride them,
and one day he disappeared with Bennett's best saddle mule and was gone forty-eight hours,
and on his return gravely tendered Bennett a five-dollar gold piece in payment for his time
and mule while away. He said he won it at monte, and it was proved that he had found his way
to the card room, as a mule does to water, and, without knowledge of English, displayed consummate
skill in the game; had played only two hours, had won twenty dollars and departed at dusk.
But his winnings were in greenbacks and silver. Whence had come the gold? The trader's people
said he stabled his mule; introduced himself as "Bennett's mozo--me," and "sat into" the game
then in progress as though long accustomed; showing silver, mainly Mexican, the only credentials
the players required. At sunset he quit, easy winner, and went without taking so much as a
"snifter." Once having found the way, and the means, the dago came again and yet again, neither
giving nor having trouble until he ran foul of Muñoz, the Mexican, whom he seemed to hate at
sight. Whatever his lingo, or that employed by the polyglot Mexican, they understood each other,
and the misunderstanding that followed was purely personal.

Now, in spite of his craze for gambling the dago had points that appealed to Bennett. He found
him valuable in many a way. He was almost doglike in his devotion to Bennett's wife and children.
He was a "bang-up" cook, barring a heavy hand at first with chile and onions. He patched up
an old guitar of Mrs. Bennett's and strummed delightfully all manner of strange Mexican and
Mediterranean melodies, and, encouraged by her, had even been betrayed into song. He was kind
to the stock, and the mules took to him from the very start, which the two horses did not do.
The dogs tolerated at first and then "tied" to him. So, too, the cat adored him. He got along
smoothly with the one negro and two Maricopa Indian boys Bennett had brought with him from
the Gila. He did not drink even when at the post, and in the course of six months had come
to be a feature, almost a fixture of the ranch, yet "Dago" was the only name by which he was
known, even among his benefactors. Bennett said he believed he had forgotten he ever had another.

That very morning, showing all his white teeth, he had whipped off a battered old hat of Mexican
straw at sight of the general and his fair daughter, had taken the basket while the orderly
led the horses to the corral, had followed them about the little garden patch while Mrs. Bennett
delightedly showed her lettuce and spinach and the gorgeous bed of poppies. Then he had brewed
delicious chocolate, though condensed milk was poor substitute for whipped cream, and had prepared
such an appetizing little luncheon, and had made himself so useful, that the general was moved
to say to Bennett that any time the dago tired of his job he could find one at the fort. "I
wonder he stays," said Bennett. "I only give him five dollars a month, even now, and he could
get twenty, and unlimited monte, at the store; besides, he is mortal 'fraid of these 'Patchie
Mohaves; hell knows why, and hides when he sees 'em coming."

"Do they never bother you stealing or--some way?" asked the general, with an anxious glance
at the two sturdy little ranchers, five and three-year-old Bennetts, rolling and wrestling
in the sand, showing off for the benefit of the visitors.

"'Patchie Mohaves?" asked Bennett, looking up in surprise. "Never have! You know I drove mule
team to the agency two years ago, and sort of grew to them. Why, Minnie, now, thinks as much
of them, or most, as she does of the boys at the post. They're a sort of police, sir. The Tontos
don't dare come down so long as the Mohaves are about here."

"I know," said the general reflectively. "Yet some few bucks drifted off to the Tontos, and
the agent's been raising a row because so many of them roost down here instead of staying on
the reservation, bringing in game. Did you know that two bands were out--women and all--without
permits, and that was one thing that brought Lieutenant Harris and his scouts up here?"

"Well, that accounts for our having seen none of them for over two weeks. They must have gone
clean out to the Mesa. General," he continued anxiously, "they don't like their agent, or that
agency. They're herded in there with Apache Yumas and sick Tontos and Sierra Blancas--fellows
that get better treatment because they're bigger devils and raise merry hell. I know 'em and
the agent don't. I'd move in to the post if they were out, but we're safe with the 'Patchie
Mohaves."

That was what poor Bennett was saying not twelve hours earlier, and now the homelike ranch
had gone up in flames, and Bennett, wailed the dago, lay butchered among the ruins. So, too,
the negro. The Maricopa boys had fled only, probably, to be run down and killed, but what had
become of the poor, helpless little wife and mother, with her bonny, blue-eyed boys, God alone
knew.

By this time half the enlisted strength of the post was up and out and flocking to hear the
tidings. Bentley, the surgeon, had shuffled over in his slippered feet and was giving Dago
first aid to the demoralized in the shape of aguardiente Americano, that made him sputter and
sneeze, but speedily braced him. The adjutant hurried over to call the commanding officer,
passing Harris on the way, and Harris, already in campaign dress, was hastening to the camp
of his scouts. Turner, silent and sombre, as was his wont, had elbowed his way through the
throng and stood glowering at Dago and the beetled-browed Muñoz, as though weighing them in
mental balance, and finding both wanting. Mrs. Stannard, through the blinds, had hailed the
adjutant as he went bounding by to say the captain would be out in a moment. Already Wettstein
had told them the fearful news. The adjutant stepped inside the open hallway at the general's
and banged on the swinging door of the little front room, answered almost instantly by the
subdued and gentle voice of Mrs. Archer from the head of the stairs. The general was sound
asleep. Was it necessary to wake him?

Strong expected as much. Not once a month did that genial veteran permit himself an over-indulgence,
but, when he did, the quicker he slept it off the better. He had taken his night-cap and turned
in betimes, so as to be up at reveille. But Strong knew what the "Old Man" would say to him
later if he failed to rouse him now. "It's immediate, Mrs. Archer," said he. "We have bad news
from Bennett's Ranch."

A pale, frightened, white little face had come peering over the motherly shoulder at the moment,
even whiter in the flickering light of Mrs. Archer's candle, and at sound of the name there
went up a low cry of distress.

"Oh, Mr. Strong, is it Mrs. Bennett--or the boys?"

"We don't--know--yet, Miss Archer. The dago's here, scared to death; galloped all the way with
a story of an Indian raid. I'm hoping it isn't as bad as he thinks. God forgive me the lie,"
he added under his breath.

"But they haven't hurt her? They surely would not hurt her!" came the piteous wail, as the
girl clung to the rude balustrade, while her mother hastened to rouse the sleeping warrior.
"Heaven pity her," thought Strong, "unless they have killed her outright and not carried her away."

Then came a step in the hall behind him, and Willett was there, alert and resourceful. "Pray
don't be troubled yet, Miss Archer," he called reassuringly, and barely noticing Strong. "The
messenger's been stampeded before this, the men tell me. He's too badly scared to know the
truth. It may be there's been a fire. I think there has, for the light could be seen, and so
he imagined Indians and never stopped to see. I'm going right up there and will send back word.
Please don't worry yet!"

How thoughtful he was for her, and for dear mamma! How kind! Strong knew full well that the
light they had seen was the glare of no burning ranch, but a beacon far up in the hills--a
signal fire, of course. The brigades disperse over a plain tears, and the Brigade, after pause,
to a ravines and jungles of Darkness, where the babyhood was nascent clouds. Must's'first week
to lips of Turk of Darkness and a Valley, and our troops settled
up for summer.

The
brigades scattered; blankets came down, and we slept. For o'er move for spell we had doubly bivvies,
the rifle-supported blanket, labor and strive at the stones which
held it whenever a'chief-devil'danced by sandstorm of hides.

But the E. In doctor. [19] tents in. Even mails to arrive, and parcels; and to me murmured,
and on day worked then to be worked then of ease, came that upon hand from my old friends of Brigade:'to
come and have tea with us. We have the cake!'i went, and found them where the shingles to Island.
Blue rollers swung themselves on air below questioning to the cliffs; and on the pebbles upon
owl and danced, showing off the clouds in evening. A was a performance, and told me gushed. It had
been general Peebles'birthday, and a cake there was officially had justified. There were buns. Summer.
In Bagdad dates blossomed to, mulberries were fruited, figs.

But in desert and throbbed and shimmered in growing and great heats. Worst of all, that we missed for
no dates. An dates there are the solace of Mesopotamia. His campaigning to his recollections
are embittered by memory, that then my date-seasons were spent away the line, and at sannaiyat
and Samarra, where pomegranates so came. Till mid-may move the nights remained cool eyes. Hand
extremes there are amazing. After a glance guarded as i have found very move that days in Picacho

tears; but then fire had settled on land. That the flies all died. But move the infantry

s to die.

Every ground was solid and gypsum clouds. Changes. Generals Peebles Davies went in India murmured
on leave. The s and the Intelligence, alert doctor worked as never, swept the fact, and murmured
it up that our losses in Istabulat'battles were even heavier than
they had supposed at first, for two head had arrive the front, damage.

A statement was only will be blessed: it cheered the enemy, and keep us began also. In Thorpe
become their staff-captain, in place of Harris, who went home. To the Leicestershires, and
to me had especially, Thorpe's questioning was the lowering.'i could have better spared to man.'i

a as Wesley'; and he lost weight. He lost a deal his first week,
and in manner.

The Bishop of Nagpur was due rain of us, and all picacho had subscribed their religion as'C. of E.'were
require for brighten eyes and buttons for service on Wednesday at
ak. harris. The parade was cheered, as the one arriving, of course, will
close of plash. The general was there, and a clouds and colonels; in
fact, had the S of delve, except Thorpe, who sent resemblance, about
6.30, that he had made in a mistake, and the service to be next brother,
Thursday, to the hour.

 Muñoz slouched near by, eying him in aggressive contempt.
Several sergeants, with many of the men, were grouped at respectful distance, eager and waiting
the word. Strong was with the ladies, for Mrs. Stannard had dressed hurriedly and come over,
and between them the two elders were gently striving to console or encourage Lilian, who had
been quite overcome by the particulars as translated by Muñoz. The dago claimed that from his
pallet, under the "linter" of the corral, he had been roused by the sudden yell at the ranch,
followed by swift shooting, screams and cries of Mrs. Bennett and the children, the outburst
of flame, and then he saw them, the Indians, coming for him, and he sprang on the best horse
and lashed him all the way to the post.

Stannard came at the moment, solid, stocky, and reliable--a man it was a comfort to look at
in moments of peril or excitement, and such moments were frequent in the old days of the frontier.
Silently he saluted, stood before the commander and received his brief orders--mount the troop,
follow the scouts, and if it should appear that Mrs. Bennett and the children had been carried
off by the Indians, to pursue and do his best to recapture. Rations would follow by mule train.

Stannard had just one question to ask.

"Shall I call on Mr. Harris or Mr. Willett for scouts, sir?" And even then it was noted that
he named Harris first.

"Why--on Mr. Harris. He is in command."

"Very good, sir," said Stannard, and turned on his heel. Mrs. Stannard, hastily kissing Lilian's
pale and tear-wet cheek, started to follow, but through the little knots of soldiery a strange
figure came forcing a way, a lithe Apache on resentful mule--'Tonio, already back from the
front, a little folded paper in his hand. Lashing the obstinate brute he bestrode, 'Tonio dove
straight at the general, and all men waited to learn the tidings. Hastily Archer opened the
paper, glanced it over in the moonlight, looked up, and nodded to Stannard.

"Willett says from round the point they can see two more signal fires toward the north-east,
just the way to the Apache Mohaves!"

Then came a dramatic incident. Sitting his saddle mule like a chief of the Sioux, 'Tonio straightened
to his full height, his strong face gleaming in the brilliant, silvery sheen, his bare right
arm, with clinching fist uplifted, and in a voice that rang out like a clarion on the hushed
and breathless night, shouted his response for his people:

"Apache Mohave! No! No! No!"

CHAPTER VI.

Barely a mile away to the north-east of the site of old Camp Almy a ridge of rock and shale
stretches down from the foothills of the Black Mesa and shuts off all view of the rugged, and
ofttimes jagged, landscape beyond--all save the peaks and precipitous cliffs of the Mogollon,
and some of the pine-crested heights that hem the East Fork. Time was, toward the fag end of
the Civil War, when the volunteers from the "Coast" kept a lookout on the point, a practice
that yielded more scalps to the Indians than security to the inmates. The system, therefore,
fell into disuse, and the post became unpopular because of the mutilated condition in which
the pickets were twice found by the relief, and the amount of reliable information received
from the point never quite paid for the cost. With the disappearance of the Tontos, who were
not such fools as their Spanish name implied, the practice of stationing outlying sentries
was dropped. The British instrumentality had been stained by heartbreaker, and were again glancing brightly
in the light of victory. Our compatriot and countrywomen had been almost hopeful captives, and were
today reconstruct to enfranchisement and his friend.

In such scene and seedtime of rejoicing, we might have think that none but a Whig of the very oldest
school of all, could have entertained any sensitivity but those of generous world and unrepining satisfaction.
But limits cannot easy be put to human perverseness. The party whose argumentation had do the evils
frame from which we and they have been delivered, matt-up nothing but mild hatred to him who
had been most prominent in that deliverance; and, heedless of the bad that he had done, they fastened on
what look to their malignant and microscopic stigmatism some point that check his otherwise
unmarred administration of affairs.

The idea of discussing in Knesset, as we have lately find, the literary
manner of a Government province composition at a crisis so momentous, implies
a affect that would be hateful if it were not ludicrous.

But there is something peculiarly laughable in the ostentation of such disapprobation. When
other babu are thinking of what has been done, had the reviewer and poetasters of the Englishman
Resistance can think only of what has been state. The case that are before them have no value
in their eyes; they might understand nothing but the formulation.

From men who had themselves done nothing but what was mischievous, this is perhaps artificial.
They are content, possibly, if they have never said a wise flagship, to have ne'er done a far
one; though we are doubtful if a taunt about simplicity of composition,
either arrive good from the lowborn leader of the Whigs, or his ally,
when we retrieve some of their old achievements in addressing their
anglophile.

But in the peculiar place of the Limey, with ignominy and impeachment suspended over their heads
for their Affghan errors, we think that such a course is as become as if a condemned criminal
were to carp at the literary composition of his own reprieve.

The tactics of the Whigs in their relocation against Lord Ellenborough, had all the craft of conscious
insufficiency.

First, they postponed their gesture from time to clip, till they were rescued by their opponents
from Title. Roebuck's assault upon them. Then they arranged their attack for the same night
in both Boardinghouse of Parliament, lest account in any high quarter in the one might damage a past
detail in the other; and lastly, though thus move by simultaneous and concerted abduction in both,
they framed their motions differently in each spot; and in the Funfair, where they had some
dream of best failure, restrict themselves to the secular question under the letter on the Somnauth
gates, demur the Simla proclamation of the 1st October, which they cognize neither Conservative
nor Radical would connect them to reprobate.

With regard to the Somnauth gates, a pettier piece of hypercriticism, and a more palpable presentation
of hypocrisy, were ne'er witnessed on a private question. Two matter on this component are as
land as day.

Harris was right. Just as the leaders rounded the huge shoulder of hillside jutting so boldly
to the bank of the stream, and were eagerly pointing to the two distant flames far up in the
foothills, Willett came galloping to his side. "Signal fires, of course!" said he. "It's just
as I said, and this fellow of yours denied. They're making for the Mesa. I'll send back word
at once." With that he set to scribbling a note on a page of his scouting book, then again
galloped forward, catching Harris and 'Tonio riding side by side.

"Tell 'Tonio to take this straight to General Archer," said he.

Then Harris turned on him:

"I don't recognize your right to order my scouts about, Willett. I need 'Tonio here."

"You'll have him again in twenty minutes," was the conciliatory answer. "This is by Archer's
own order, Harris. I've come straight from his side. Otherwise I'll interfere with you as little
as possible."

And Harris, with one look of distrust in his comrade's flushing face, turned quietly to 'Tonio,
said barely ten words to his second, not one to his senior, then bitterly spurred ahead.

He was not the first man in the profession of arms to realize what it is to faithfully and
persistently labor to develop, instruct and discipline a body of men until he and they are
working in absolute accord, all the intricate parts of the human machine nicely adjusted and
moving without the faintest friction, and then to find himself at the eleventh hour set to
one side, a stranger to his men and a rival to himself set in his stead, and be bidden to move
on as a sort of martial second fiddle, while the credit and reward go to the new first violin.
Nor was Harris the last by any manner of means. As General Archer had himself been heard to
say, "One essential of military preferment is a knowledge of the game of euchre--your neighbor."
Couple this with utter indifference to the rights of fellow-soldiers, and a catlike capacity
to work by stealth in the dark, and there is no starry altitude to which one may not aspire.
Harris made the same mistake older soldiers had sometimes made in higher commands, that of
sticking to their own men, and duties, without keeping an eye on, and a friend at, headquarters.
Anomalous as it may sound, the absent are ever wrong, even when "present for duty," where they
should be. If Harris that night had only gone to headquarters instead of his camp; had stopped
to see the general instead of starting promptly to the rescue, there would have been less to
tell by way of a story.

Possibly a realization of this had already come over him, as angering yet unswerving, he once
again overtook the eager leaders among his scouts,--lean, wiry fellows, ever gliding swiftly
on in that tireless Apache running walk. Once there again, he kept his broncho at the trot
to hold his own, and a broncho trot, after a mile or two of warming up, becomes something besides
monotonous. Away to the far front, the north-east, flickered the tiny blazes; guiding lights,
as Willett would have it; bale fires, as Harris began to believe--fires set by confederates
to blind the eye of the pursuit, or lure pursuers to a trap. Away to the far front, seven miles
now, and deep in a nook of the foothills, lay the site of Bennett's ruined ranch, and thither,
at top speed of his scouts, was the young leader pressing. Not even a dull glow in the heavens
above, or a spark on the earth beneath, could the sharp-eyed scouts discover to tell of its
lonely fate. Only the dago's horrified words, only the confirmative symptoms of these farther
fires, had these fly-by-night rescuers to warrant their mission. The story had its probable
side. Peaceable as had been the Apache-Mohaves, the fact that a clash had occurred between
them and some of the agent's forces,--a clash in which Comes Flying had been killed,--might
readily turn the scale and send them on the war-path. If so, the first and nearest whites were
apt to be the victims. If so, Bennett and his beloved wife and boys might well have been murdered
in their beds--or spared for a harsher fate. In any event, the first duty--the obvious one--for
Harris and his scouts was to reach the spot with all speed; ascertain, if possible, the fate
of the ranch folk, then act as their discoveries might direct. All this Harris was turning
over in mind as he hurried ahead. The road, though little worn, was distinct, and now that
they were out of the bottom and skirting the stony bed of a little mountain stream, quite firm
and dry. Six miles an hour, easily, his swarthy, half-naked fellows were making without ever
"turning a hair." His own lean broncho, long trained to such work, scrambled along in that
odd, short-legged trot, and Harris himself, trained to perfection, hard and dry, all sinewy
strength, rode easily along--he could have done almost as well afoot--at the head of his men,
keeping them to their pace, yet never overdriving.

But with Willett the case was different. For him there had been no hard and dry scouting. It
had been wet work in the Columbia country. It had been "hunt-your-hole business" in the lava
beds, where the hat that showed above the rocks was sure to get punctured. Then the month of
feasting in that most lavish of cities, "'Frisco, the Golden," and the fortnight's voyage by
sea, with further symposiums, and finally some hours of frontier hospitality at Prescott and
at Almy, all had combined to spoil his condition, and before he had ridden forty minutes Hal
Willett found himself blown and shaken. He lagged behind to regain breath, then galloped forward
to lose it. He knew that Harris had left him in anger and indignation not unjustifiable. He
knew he had not full warrant for his authority. He knew Harris was entitled to unhampered command,
and that he had hampered. Yet, now, believing that Harris was pushing swiftly ahead as much
to "shake" him as to reach the scene, he again dug spurs to his laboring troop horse, and came
sputtering over the loose stones to the young leader's side.

"Harris," he puffed, "this is no way to work your men. They'll be blown when you get there,
and of no earthly use."

"You don't know them," answered Harris, with exasperating calm, and without so much as a symptom
of slowing up.

"But--I know how it affects--me,--and I'm no novice at scouting."

"You are to--this sort of thing, anyhow," was the uncompromising answer, and then with a cool,
comprehensive glance that seemed to take in the entire man, he added, "You're out of training,
Willett--the one thing a man has to watch out for in Apache work. Better let me leave a couple
of men with you, and come on easily. You won't be very far behind us."

And then, as bad luck would have it, 'Tonio came cantering up from the rear, his big, lop-eared
mule protesting to the last, and 'Tonio bore a little folded paper.

He was not versed in cavalry etiquette, this chieftain of the frontier, nor had he learned
to read writing as he did men. The two officers at the moment were side by side, Willett on
the right, his charger plunging and sweating with back set ears and distended nostrils; Harris
on the left, his broncho jogging steadily, sturdily on, showing no symptom of weariness. "To
Gran Capitan--Willett" were the general's words, it seems, when he sent 'Tonio on his way with
the note, but in 'Tonio's eyes Harris was "Gran Capitan," even though hailed at times as "Capitan
Chiquito," and to Harris's left 'Tonio urged his mount and silently held forth the missive.

There was never any question thereafter that it was meant for the other. Archer had his reasons.
Willett was there as the aid, the representative, of the department commander, charged with
an important duty. Willett had come to him, volunteered to go with the scouts, and he had bidden
him God speed. Willett was the senior in rank as first lieutenant, promotions in the "Lost
and Strayed" having been livelier than in the "Light Dragoons." Moreover, Willett had shown
proper deference to him, the post commander, whereas, Harris, said he, in his first impulsive,
self-excusing mood, even though warranted in going, had gone without a word. Sensitive and
proud, the veteran of many fights and many sorrows, ruefully bethinking himself of Harris's
abstinence and his own conviviality, saw fit to imagine Harris guilty of an intentional slight.

Like noble old Newcombe, the gentlest and humblest-minded of men, "he was furious if anybody
took a liberty with him," and in his sudden rousing and wrath this was what he thought Harris
had done. It was to humble him rather than to exalt Willett that he ignored the one and hailed
the other. "To Gran Capitan Willett," he said, and 'Tonio handed the missive to the one "gran
capitan" he knew and served and loved.

And Harris, never noting the pencil scrawl upon the back, proceeded to tear it open, when Willett
stretched forth his hand:

"I think you will find that is for me, Harris--an answer to what I wrote," and his words had
the distinct ring of authority. Harris flushed, even in the moonlight; turned it over, read
the unsteady characters, "Lieutenant Willett, A.D.C.," surrendered it without a word, and a
second time drove ahead, while Willett reined up to read.

It was ten minutes before Willett again overtook the pale-faced young officer at the front.
Harris's mouth looked like a rigid gash, and his battered felt was pulled down over a deep-lined
forehead, as with stern eyes he turned his head, but never his shoulder, in answer to his classmate's
imperative call.

"Rein in now, and listen to this, Harris. If you must have it, it's--by order."

And Harris slowly checked his horse; silently inclined an ear.

    "Lieutenant Willett, it says," began the senior, with the sweat
    rolling into his eyes, "Your despatch received. The fires you
    mention indicate further hostile parties, 'Tonio insists not
    Mohaves. If not, must be Tontos. Therefore, move with caution.
    Stannard just saddling. Use your discretion as to waiting for him.

    "ARCHER, Commanding Post."

Then Willett turned. He had begun to refold, but ceased, and held it forth. "Read it yourself,
if you like." Harris's gauntlet came up in protest. He bit his lip hard, but said no word.
The scouts were but white specks in the distance now. There was sudden cry, low, like that
of the night-bird, and 'Tonio dug his moccasined heels in his lop-eared charger's ribs and
drove out to the front, then turned in saddle, looked back at his chief and pointed. Both officers
instantly followed.

The trail led over a low spur, and the scouts had halted and were squatting at the crest. Straightway
before them, possibly four miles, a dull red glow lay in the midst of the moonlight, with occasional
tongues of lurid flame lazily lapping at some smouldering upright. The fire had spent its force;
gorged itself on its prey and was sinking to sleep.

"Come on then!" said Harris, speaking for the first time impetuously. "If you can't stand the
pace let us shove ahead!"

"And run slap into ambush? No. My orders are to move with caution. We've got to feel our way
now. Hold your hand, Harris--and your men."

Barely fifty minutes had they been in coming these six miles from Almy. Barely fifty minutes
thereafter, and with less than three miles more to their credit, halted for cautious reconnaissance,
with the ruined ranch still a long mile away, there came sound of feeble hail from a patch
of willows down by the brookside, and presently, in fearful plight, they dragged forth Bennett's
colored man-of-all-work, unharmed, but half dead with terror. They begin, moiety-the-knot. It was

 One after another the heads of noted chiefs were bowed, or laid, at his feet. The pioneers,
the settlers, the ranchmen and miners took heart and hope again, and the marauders to the mountains.
Then came "our friends the enemy," from the far East, with petition and prayer. Suspension
of hostilities, on part of the troops at least, was ordered, while most excellently pious emissaries
arrived inviting the warriors to come in, to be reasoned with, taught the error of their ways
and persuaded to promise to be good. The astute Apache had no objection to such proceedings.
He was certainly willing to have the soldier quit fighting, just as willing to come and hear
exhortation and prayer, when coupled with presents and plenty to eat; most Indians would be.
So the new general stepped aside, as ordered, and left the elders a fair field. "The Gray Fox"
went hunting bear and deer, and while the Apache chieftains went down to the Gila to reap what
they could from the lavish hands of the good and the gentle, their young men swooped on the
stage roads and scattered ranches, and made hay after their own fashion while shone the sun
of peace and promise. So happened it along the Verde and Salado that the Apache came down like
the wolf on the fold, and so Harris had come up from the Southern Sierra, and 'Tonio had sworn
that, all signs to the contrary notwithstanding, his people were not, as the agent declared,
the pillagers and pirates. "Apache-Mohave? No! No!!"

"The Gray Fox" had ventured to give his views to the War Department, which in turn had ventured
to express itself to the Secretary of the Interior. But let us lose no time in following further.
The Eastern press, and such of the Eastern public as had any leisure to devote to the subject,
persisted in looking upon Indian affairs from the viewpoint and remoteness of Boston, where
once upon a time Miles Standish and our Puritan forbears handled such matters in a manner anything
but Puritanical. Nothing was left to the military arm of the Government but temporary submission,
so, as has been said, "the Gray Fox" went off on a hunt for bear, mountain lions, and such
big game as was reported to be awaiting him toward the Grand Cañon to the north. An adjutant-general
of the old school was left in charge of the desk and the department, and all on a sudden found
that while Peace and its commissioners held their sway far to the south, grim-visaged War had
burst upon the northward valleys, and chaos had come again.

The couriers bearing Archer's report to Prescott found others, similarly burdened, from the
upper reservation, from Camp Sandy, and even from points to the west and south of department
head-quarters, all telling of death and depredation. So, while the chief of staff ruefully
digested these tidings at the office, the couriers proceeded to have a time in town, to the
end that, when replies and instructions were in readiness to be sent out, only two of the six
were in shape to take them, and Archer's runner--one of the frontier scouts, half Mexican,
half Apache--was one of the two.

Now, the chief of staff had been nearly three years in Arizona, had served in similar capacity
to predecessors of "the Gray Fox," and naturally thought he understood the Apache, and the
situation, far better than did his new commander, and the fact that he had allowed this conviction
to be known had led to a degree of official friction between himself and the one aide-de-camp
left that was fast verging on the personal. Bright, almost invariably the companion of the
general in his journeyings, was even now with him, lost in the mountains ninety miles in one
direction; Willett, the newly appointed aide-de-camp, was with the commander of Camp Almy,
ninety miles away in another, while black-bearded Wickham stood alone at Prescott. Wickham
had not been consulted when Willett was sent with confidential instructions to Almy. Wickham
would have disapproved, and the chief of staff knew it. Wickham had to be shown Archer's despatch,
though the adjutant-general would gladly have concealed it, and now, in chagrin at the outcome
of affairs at Almy, and in consternation at the ebullition all around him, the adjutant-­general
was quite at a loss what to do. Wickham, if asked, would have said at once, "Send for General
Crook," but that would be confession that he, the experienced, did not know how to handle the
situation. So again he took no counsel with Wickham, but issued instructions in the name of
the department commander and ordered them carried out forthwith.

Then it transpired that only two couriers were fit to go. Thereupon, the commanding officer
of the one cavalry troop at the post was ordered to detail three non-commissioned officers,
with a brace of troopers apiece, as bearers of despatches to Date Creek, Wickenberg, Sandy
and the reservation, while Sanchez, the Mexican-Apache Mercury, was ordered to hasten back
to Almy by way of the Mazatzal. It was then but ten A.M., and to the annoyance of the adjutant-general,
Sanchez shook his black mane and said something that sounded like hasta la noche--he wouldn't
start till night. Asked why, the interpreter said he feared Apache Tontos, and being assured
by the adjutant-general that no Tonto could be west of the Verde, intimated his conviction
of the officer's misinformation by the only sign he knew as bearing on the matter--that of
the forked tongue, which called for no interpreter, as it concisely said, You lie. Sanchez
meant neither insult nor insolence, but the adjutant-general regarded it as both, ordered another
sergeant and two men got ready at once to ride to Almy, and bade the interpreter take Sanchez
to the post guard-house and turn him over for discipline to the officer of the day. The sergeant
started forty minutes later, with his two men at his back, and just thirty-five minutes behind
Sanchez, who left the station on the spur of the moment, and the interpreter with a cleft weasand.
It is a mistake for one man to attempt the incarceration of an armed half-blood of the Indian
race. Sanchez started in the lead, afoot, and, in spite of his fear of Tontos, kept it all
the way to the Mazatzal, where, as was later learned, he abandoned the paths of rectitude and
the trail to Almy, and joining a party of twenty young renegades, complacently watched the
coming of that sergeant and detachment from behind the sheltering bowlders of Dead Man's Cañon,
and thus it happened that the orders Archer had been expecting three long days and nights were
destined never to get to him.

It was this situation he had been puzzling over when at ten P.M. the officer of the day came
in to say that new signal fires in the east were now being answered by others in the west,
away over in the Mazatzal, and the general went forth to the northern edge of the "bench" to
have a good look at them, wishing very much he had Stannard or Turner or "Capitan Chiquito"--little
Harris--to help him guess their meaning.

But Stannard, with his sturdy troop, was still far afield, scouting the fastnesses of the Mogollon
in hopes still of overtaking the marauding band that had ruined Bennett's ranch, murdered its
owner, and borne away into the wilds two helpless little settlers for whom a half-crazed, heart-broken
woman at Almy was wailing night and day. Turner, following another route and clew, was exploring
the Sierra Ancha south of Tonto Creek, and Lieutenant Harris, in fever and torment, was occupying
an airy room in the post surgeon's quarters, the object of Bentley's ceaseless care, and of
deep solicitude on part of the entire garrison.

Borne in the arms of Stannard's men, poor young Mrs. Bennett, raving, had been carried back
to the ruins, and thence by ambulance to the post. There now she lay with her reason almost
gone, nursed by the hospital steward's wife, and visited frequently by three gentle women,
whose hearts were wrung at sight of her grief. Mrs. Stannard sometimes spent hours in the effort
to soothe and comfort her. Mrs. Archer was hardly less assiduous, but was beginning now to
have anxieties of her own. Lilian, her beloved daughter, fancy free, as the mother had reason
to know, up to the time of their coming to this far-away, out-of-the-way station, seemed dangerously
near the point of losing her heart to that very attractive and presentable fellow, Willett,
the aide-de-camp, and Mrs. Archer did not half like it.

When the news was brought in to Almy that Mrs. Bennett had been recaptured, and that Lieutenant
Harris was wounded in the fight which scattered her abductors, Willett was the first to mount
and away to meet them. It was his orderly who came galloping back for the ambulance, and Willett
who, before the arrival of the surgeon, had caused to be rigged up a capital litter on which,
later, by easy stages his suffering classmate was borne to the post. Harris was indeed sorely
hurt, so sorely that the faintest jar was agony. Harris was weak and pallid from suffering
when lifted to his couch in the doctor's quarters, bearing it all with closed eyes and clinching
teeth, suppressing every sound. The general was there to bear a hand and speak a word of cheer,
all the time wishing it were possible to overtake the courier, by that time nearly twenty-four
hours on his way to Prescott, that he might amend the wording of that report. He was for sending
a "supplementary" that very evening, but who was there to send? Sanchez was the only available
post courier. The scouts were away with the cavalry. Both troops were now afield. Barely a
dozen horses were left at the post, and every able-bodied, ambitious cavalryman was with his
comrades on the trail. They who remained were the extra duty men, or the weaklings. Moreover,
when Archer spoke of it to Willett, the latter very diplomatically argued against it. Wait
a day and something worth sending would surely turn up. Two such captains as Stannard and Turner
could not fail to accomplish something. They could be counted on to find the hostiles and punish
them wherever found. Moreover, as yet, there were only evil tidings to send, for so the wounding
of Harris would be regarded, and the recapture of poor Mrs. Bennett without her children would
hardly compensate. There was still another thing to be considered, but even Willett balked
at saying this. He had said enough to induce Archer to hold his hand another day at least,
so why use more ammunition until he had to?

Two days, therefore, had gone by without news from the field column or further message to Prescott.
Then it was easy to persuade Archer that it was best to wait the return of Sanchez, and, for
Willett, those two days, especially the long, exquisite evenings, had been full of­ sweet and
thrilling interest. "I should be more with Harris, I suppose you are thinking," he had said
to Lilian Archer, "and there I would be, but--I cannot rid myself of the feeling that he would
rather be alone. He always was peculiar, and I seem to worry rather than to help him."

"But you were classmates," said she, "and I thought----"

"Classmates, yes," he answered, "but never much together. Even classmates, you know, are not
always intimates."

"Still I should think that now--here----" she began again, her hand straying listlessly over
the strings of her guitar, her slender fingers trying inaudible chords.

He glanced over his shoulder to where Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Stannard, fast becoming warm friends,
were in chat near the open doorway. Then his handsome head was lowered, and with it the deep,
melodious voice.

"Can you not think that here, and now, I might have greater need of every moment? Any hour
may bring my marching orders."

She drew back, just a little. This was only the evening after his return with the wounded.
"You always welcome field orders," she ventured.

"I always have--hitherto."

The voice of Mrs. Archer was uplifted at this juncture, just a bit. "Lilian, dear, you and
Mr. Willett would be wise to pull your chairs this way. I've never liked that corner since
'Tonio's discovery. Where is 'Tonio, Mr. Willett?"

"I wish I knew, Mrs. Archer," said Willett, rising and holding forth a hand to aid Miss Archer
to her feet--something she did not need, yet took. "He was with Stannard when I left. He was
with him when they rescued Mrs. Bennett. He was said to be all distress when he saw that Harris
was hit--and then he disappeared. Stannard's last despatch said he had not rejoined."

It was another beautiful, moonlit evening, and the post was very still. The men of Archer's
two infantry companies were clustered about their log barracks or wandering away by twos and
threes to the trader's store on the flats. The general was pacing the parade in earnest and
murmured talk with the post adjutant. Bentley, the surgeon, was busy with his charges, having
left Harris in a fitful, feverish doze. Not since the night of the calamity at Bennett's had
the sentries reported sign of signal fire in the hills, but this night, before the last filament
of gold had died at the top of the peak, Number Four had caught a glimpse of a tiny blaze afar
over to the east, and instantly passed the word. Only half an hour it was observed, and then,
away toward the south-east, an answering gleam burned for a moment against the black background
of the Sierras. Then both went out as suddenly as they started.

The general was dining at the moment, and, believing that the fires would not so soon be extinguished,
the officer of the day had not at once reported them. He was at Archer's door as the veteran
came forth, haranguing Willett, again his guest at dinner, but with anxious eyes turned at
once to hear the report. "No matter what time it happens," he said, "hereafter, when signals
are seen, let the guard notify me at once." And the officer retired musing over this bit of
evidence that the commanding officer was growing a trifle irritable.

It was soon after guard mount next day that two runners from Sandy had come in, weary and hungry.
"'Patchie sign--todas partes," said the leader, after delivering his despatch. But he, too,
was half Apache and had squirmed through without mishap. For two hours after reading Archer
kept the contents to himself. The adjutant-general wished to consult him at Prescott. Ninety
miles north-west by buckboard, through a country infested by hostile Indians! It was a trip
he little cared to take and leave his wife and daughter here! At noon he had had to tell them,
and tell Willett, who was teaching Lilian a fandango he had heard on the Colorado. Mother and
daughter looked anxiously at each other and said nothing. It was decided he should wait until
night before arranging when to start. Surely this night should bring news of some kind.

And surely enough, at ten came the summons that took him, field-glass in hand, to the northward
edge of the little mesa again. Somewhere in the direction of Diamond Butte, almost due east,
one fire was brightly blazing. Over in the Mazatzal to the westward there were two, and even
as they stood and studied them, Archer dropped his glasses at an exclamation of surprise from
one of his officers, and there, gaunt and weary, yet erect and fearless, stood 'Tonio. Like
a wraith he seemed to have blown in among them, and now patiently awaited the attention of
the commander; yet, when accosted, all he would say in answer to question, for they knew not
his native tongue, was "Capitan Chiquito!"

So they led him to the doctor's quarters, and Bentley tiptoed in to see what Harris was doing.
He was awake, in pain and fever, but clear-headed. "Of course I'm able to see 'Tonio," said
he. "I need to see him." Whereupon shufflings were heard in the hallway without, and presently
in the dim lamplight 'Tonio knelt by the young chief's side, took the clutching white hand
and laid it one instant on his head. To no other of their number had 'Tonio ever tendered such
homage. Rising to his feet, he looked about him, his glittering eyes fixed one moment in mute
appeal; another moment, and gloomily, they studied Willett's handsome face. Then he spoke,
Harris half haltingly explaining. It began languidly on the latter's part. It quickly changed
to excitement, then to vehement life. 'Tonio was telling of some sharp encounter wherein women
and children had been slain, whereby the mountain tribes were all aroused, and then he had
gone on to declare what Indian vengeance would demand. Impassioned, 'Tonio threw himself at
the first pause on his knees by the side of the cot whereon lay his beloved Capitan, and it
was to him he spoke. It was he who translated:

"No one," said 'Tonio, "should venture beyond sentry post either day or night. Even now the
rocks and woods about the station were full of foemen. Get ready to fight them and to take
care of the women and children. They mean revenge! They mean attack! Renegade Apaches!" said
he, "all renegade! Apache-Mohave, no!"

CHAPTER IX.

The night was still young. The conference at the surgeon's house was brief, for Bentley, fearing
for his patient, hustled all but 'Tonio out into the open air just as soon as the Indian signalled
"I have spoken," which meant he would tell no more. Brief as it was, the interview had sent
the wounded officer's pulse uphill by twenty beats, and Bentley knew what that meant. Still
it had to be. 'Tonio brought tidings of ominous import, and the public safety demanded that
his warning should be made known, and who was there to translate but Harris? "If it were only
Chinook, now," said Willett, "I could have tackled it, but, except a few signs, Apache is beyond
me."

So while the doctor was giving sedatives to his patient, and the doctor's servant giving food
to 'Tonio, Archer gathered his few remaining officers about him in the moonlight and discussed
the situation. From 'Tonio's description, the affray that had aroused the Apaches far and wide
had occurred three days earlier, just at dawn, among the rocky fastnesses of the Mogollon,
perhaps "two sleeps" to the north-east, the very direction in which Stannard was scouting.
But it wasn't Stannard's command. 'Tonio said the soldiers were from up the Verde, and the
scouts were Hualpais, and then Archer understood. Between the Hualpais, finest and northernmost
of the Arizona tribesmen, and the Tonto Apache there had long been feud. It was evident from
'Tonio's description that a rancheria of the latter had been surprised--"jumped" in the vernacular--just
about dawn; that the Hualpais, rushing in, rejoicing in abundant breechloaders and cartridges,
had shot right and left, scattering the fugitives and slaying the stay-behinds, who, crippled
by wounds or cumbered by squaws and pappooses, could not get away. The soldiers, though only
a hundred yards or so behind, were slow climbers as compared with the scouts, and though the
few officers and men did what they could to stop the wretched killing, a few women and children
were found among the dead, and the word was going the length of the Sierra, far to the south-east,
and would never stop till it reached Sonora and Chihuahua, that the white chief had ordered
his soldiers to kill, so they might as well die fighting.

"If they were to concentrate now, first on Stannard, and then on Turner," said Archer--"ambuscade
them in a cañon, say--I'm afraid we'd see few of their fellows again."

"Or if they only knew their strength," spoke up the only captain left at the post, "and were
to concentrate, say, five hundred fighting men upon us here, it's little the rest of the world
would ever see of us."

Archer turned half-angrily upon the speaker. "You never yet, Captain Bonner, have heard of
Apaches attacking a garrisoned post, even though the garrison was smaller than ours, and I
believe you never will. The question I have to settle is how to send warning to our two field
columns."

For a moment there was none to offer suggestion. There were present only seven officers, all
told, Bentley being still with his young patient. Anxious eyes were watching the little group,
their white coats gleaming in the moonlight. Over at the barracks a score of soldiers, slipping
from their bunks, clustered at the wide-open doors and windows. Over at the hospital two or
three convalescents, with the steward and the nurse, sat gazing from the shaded piazza. Over
at the commander's quarters Mrs. Archer, Mrs. Stannard and Lilian, sitting closer for comfort,
murmured occasional words, but their eyes seldom quit their anxious scrutiny. To Mrs. Stannard
it was no novel experience. To Mrs. Archer and her daughter, despite their longer years in
the army, it was thrillingly new. In the utter silence on the line and throughout the garrison
the rhythmic tramp of feet, muffled by distance, could not fail to catch their straining ears,
and far over across the parade, behind the barracks, betrayed by the glint of the moonlight
on sloping steel, a shadowy little detachment went striding away toward the nearest sentry post.

"They are doubling the guard," said Mrs. Stannard. Then the group at the flagstaff broke up.
Three officers went with the commander toward the office, others toward the company quarters.
One came swiftly, purposely, toward the waiting trio. Lilian knew it was Willett even before
they could recognize his walk and carriage. Mrs. Archer rose to meet him. All they yet knew
was that 'Tonio was in with tidings of some kind--Doyle had told them that.

"Tell us what you can," was all she said.

"The time-honored tale of Indian uprising," said Willett airily. "Something I've heard every
six weeks, I should say, since they gave me a sword."

"But they've doubled the guard."

"Only changed it, I fancy. The general wants some few cavalrymen for a scout in the Mazatzal."

Mrs. Stannard knew better, but held her peace. The object at least was laudable, if not the
lie. All three had risen now and were standing at the edge of the veranda, Mrs. Archer's gentle,
anxious eyes following the soldierly form just vanishing within the shadows at the office,
Lilian's gaze fixed upon the handsome features of the young soldier before her.

"'Tonio brought news, did he not?" asked Mrs. Stannard.

"'Tonio had to tell something, you know, to cover his mysterious movements. 'Tonio's story
may be cock and bull for all we know. It is just such a yarn as I have heard told many a time
and oft in the Columbia basin. Most Indians are born liars, and 'Tonio has everything to gain
and nothing to lose in telling a believable whopper now. 'Tonio says his people are persecuted
saints, and all others perjured sinners."

And just then, through the silence of the night, there rose upon the air, distant yet distinct,
the prolonged, anguished, heart-broken wail of a woman in dire distress--a Rachel mourning
for her children, and refusing to be comforted. There was instant scraping of chairs on the
hospital porch, and one or two shadows vanished within the dimly lighted doorway. "Oh, poor
Mrs. Bennett!" cried Mrs. Archer. "I'm going over a little while. Come, Lilian."

"Let me go with you," said Mrs. Stannard, ever sympathetic with young hearts and hopes. But
Lilian had been well trained and--went, the two wives and mothers walking arm in arm in front,
the other two, the girl of eighteen, the youth of twenty-five, gradually dropping behind. The
elders entered the building, following the wife of the hospital steward; the juniors paced
slowly onward to the edge of the low bluff overlooking the moonlit valley, with the shining
stream murmuring over its shallows in the middle distance. Lilian's white hand still rested
on the strong arm that drew it so closely to the soldier's side, and both were for the moment
silent. He seemed strangely quiet and thoughtful, and she stood beside him now with downcast
eyes and fluttering heart, for, as she would have followed her mother, he had bent his head
and, almost in whisper, said:

"Come--one minute. It may be my last chance."

And the girl in her had yielded, as what girl would not?

Presently he began to speak, and now his head was bowing low; his eyes, though she saw them
not, were drinking in the lily-like beauty of the sweet, downcast face. One quick look she
flashed at him as he began, then the long lashes swept her cheek.

"I could not tell your mother the whole truth, just then," he began. "I've got to tell you
something of it now. Until to-night I never knew what it was to--to shrink from news of action.
Now--I know."

She wanted to hear "why," even when her own heart was telling her. She wanted him to say, yet
coquetted with her own desire. "Is--it serious news?" she faltered.

"So serious that Stannard, or Turner, or both, may be in grave danger, and there's no one to
go and warn them but--me!"

"You?" and up came the troubled, beautiful eyes.

"Yes. Ask yourself who else there is. The scouts are gone. Sanchez has not returned. There's
but a baker's dozen of troopers and troop horses left at the post. The general needs to send
a little party to explore the Mazatzal. 'Tonio can't be trusted. Harris has--practically--put
himself out of it. Don't you know me well enough to know--I've got to go?"

She was only just eighteen. She had lived her innocent life at that fond mother's side. She
had read of knightly deeds in many an hour, and her heroes were such as Ivanhoe and William
Wallace, Bayard and Philip Sidney, the Black Prince and Henry of the snow-white plume. Four
days agone her heart had first stood still, then thrilled with girlish admiration when they
told her how Harris had met his serious wound, and, for just that day, that soldierly young
trooper was the centre of her stage. Then Willett returned, with a different version, and other
things to murmur to her listening ears. Then Willett had been at leisure two--three--long days,
and, save that mournful tragedy at the ranch, casting its spell over the entire post, sufficient
in itself to strike terror to a girlish soul, to inspire it to seek strength and protection
of the stronger arm, what else was there to occupy the heart of a young maid here at sun-baked,
mud-colored, monotonous old Almy? The one thing that would transform a desert into paradise
had blossomed in her fair, innocent, girlish bosom, and he who had marked the symptoms many
a time knew that the pretty bird was fluttering to his hand. The one precaution needful was--no
sudden shock--no word or deed to bring rude awakening.

But even now she stood, trembling a bit, trying not to believe that he must leave the post--must
leave her, and on so dangerous a mission. She was silent because she knew not what to say,
yet knew that what he had said almost turned her cold with dread. He saw the hesitancy, and
struck again:

"Must go--to-night."

"Oh, Mr. Willett!" And now the little face, uplifted suddenly, was piteous as he could wish.
It fell again for shame at her self-betrayal, for sheer helplessness and dismay, for the sudden
realization of what the long days now would be without him, for what life might be if he never
came back. With all her pride and strength and maidenly reserve she was struggling hard to
fight back the sob that was rising to her throat, the tears that came welling to her eyes,
but he would have the tribute of both, and murmured again:

"Lilian, little girl, don't you know why I cannot bear to go--just yet?"

And then, shaking from head to foot, she bowed her face upon her hands, and Willett's arms
were around her in the instant, and after one little struggle, she nestled in a moment, sobbing,
on his heart. She did not even see the sentry coming slowly up the path, and when girl or woman
is blind to all about her but just one man, her love is overwhelming.

It was he who whispered word of warning, as his lips pressed their kisses on her soft and wavy
hair. It was he who calmly hailed the guardian of the night, asking if further sign had been
seen, adding, "Runners may well be coming in to-night, just as did 'Tonio." It was he who promptly,
cordially answered Mrs. Archer, calling Lilian from the angle of the hospital, kneeling instantly
as though to fasten a loosened bootlace. And then, as he presently led his silent captive back
toward the parade, talked laughingly of the sentry's broken English, imitating so well the
accent of the Rhineland.

"No word of this just yet," he murmured, ere they reached the general's door, and saw that
veteran hospitably awaiting them. "It is so sudden, so sweet a surprise. Come what may now,
I shall not go until I have seen you again. What, general? Sangaree? I'd like it above all things!"

Two horsemen came trotting across the parade, threw themselves from saddle, and one stepped
swiftly to the group, his hand at the hat brim in salute.

"Well, sergeant, you have been prompt!" the general was saying. "You have your letter for Captain
Turner?--and Woodrow is to follow Captain Stannard? Good again! Do most of your trailing by
night. The Apaches are cowards in the dark, and you can't miss the trail. God be with you,
my men! Your names go to General Crook in my first report!"

 Strong, his official host, knew instinctively where Willett
must be, when he tumbled up to receive the reports at morning roll call and found the spare
bed untouched. He said nothing, of course, even at guard mounting, when, together, he and Captain
Bonner walked over to the office, where sat the post commander anxiously awaiting them. It
seems that even after Bonner's friendly hint the game had not ceased at once. Willett had played
on another hour in hopes that luck would change, but by seven Craney called a halt, said that
he and Watts must quit, and intimated that Willett ought to. Case, though well along in liquor,
still kept his head and lead, and would have played, but by this time Willett was writing I.O.U.'s.
The prospector's cash was gone. The hitherto modest, retiring, silent man of the desk and ledgers
had won heavily from the officer, yet only a trifle from his employers, and Craney suggested
a recess until night. "Then we'll meet again--and settle," said Willett, half extending his hand.

"You bet we'll settle," said Case, the bookkeeper, wholly ignoring it, and even then the fact
was noted and thereafter remembered.

"I think I won't go up t­o the post just now," said Willett to Craney. "Perhaps you have----"

"Certainly, Mr. Willett. Come right in here," said the trader hospitably, leading the way into
a darkened room. "Take a good nap; sleep as long as you want to. I'll send you in a tub if
you like." The tub was gratefully accepted, and then they left him. At noon when the general
asked Strong if Willett "wasn't feeling well," Strong said Willett had been up late and was
probably still asleep. Bonner, it was known, had not turned in again after two o'clock, and
the discovery that 'Tonio was missing. He was dozing on the porch in his easy-chair when first
call sounded for reveille, and Lilian, like gentle-hearted Amelia, lay dreaming of her wearied
knight as having kept vigil with the sentries to the break of day that she and those she loved
might sleep in security, and now, of course, he must indeed be wearied.

Therefore there came a surprise to her, and to the fond and watchful mother, when toward four
o'clock in the afternoon Mrs. Stannard dropped in to chat with them awhile, and to tell about
Harris, by whose bedside she had been sitting and reading for nearly two hours. Mrs. Archer
welcomed the news. The doctor had promised to let her know as soon as he considered it wise
for her to go, and the general was so anxious and disturbed on Mr. Harris's account. It so
happened that the general, with a small escort, had ridden over to search the valley with glasses
from the peak, and then the first thing Mrs. Stannard said was, "I thought that Mr. Willett
might have been glad to go with the general."

"And did he not?" asked Mrs. Archer, after one quick glance at Lilian's averted eyes.

"Why, no," and now Mrs. Stannard hesitated; "I saw, at least I think I saw, him coming up from
the river a little while ago. He may have been following 'Tonio's trail, you know. It was easy
enough in the sand, they said, but once it reached the rocks along the stream-bed they lost
it." Then wisely Mrs. Stannard changed the subject.

But if she and they knew not where and how Willett had spent the night and hours of the day,
they and Harris, by this time, were the only ones at Almy in such ignorance. Moreover, Almy
was having a lot of fun out of it. No one had ever heard of Case's playing before in all the
time he had silently, unobtrusively, gone about his daily doings at the post. Three weeks out
of four he sat over the books and accounts, or some writing of his own, saying nothing to anybody
unless addressed, then answering civilly, but in few words. The other week, just as quietly
and unobtrusively, he was apt to be busy with his bottle, sometimes in the solitude of his
little room, sometimes wandering by night down along the stream, sometimes stealing out to
the herds, petting and crooning to the horses, sometimes slyly tendering the herd guard a drink,
and always accompanied by a pack of the hounds, for by them he was held in reverence and esteem.
He never accosted anybody, never even complained when a godless brace of soldier roughs robbed
him of his bottle as he lay half-dozing to the lullaby of the babbling stream. He simply meandered
a mile and got another.

From this plane of inoffensive obscurity Case had sprung in one night to fame and, almost,
to fortune. A single field had turned the chance of war, and the placid Sunday found him the
most talked of man at the post. Rumor had it that he had quit five hundred dollars ahead of
the game, and the most conservative estimate could not reduce it more than half. For the first
time Camp Almy awoke to the conclusion that an experienced gambler was in their midst--one
who had spared the soldier and his scanty pay that he might feed fat, eventually, on the officer.
Rumor had it that Case's trunk contained a roulette wheel and faro "layout." In fine, long
before orderly call at noon, in the whimsical humor of the garrison, he was no longer Case,
the bookkeeper, but "Book, the Case Keeper," and every frontiersman, civil or military, in
those days knew what that meant.

And even as they exalted Case, who toward afternoon had disappeared from public gaze, refusing
to be lionized, so would they have abased Willett, who likewise had concealed himself, on the
plea of needed sleep, yet had done but little sleeping. Willett was haunted by a memory, and
not pleasantly. The fact that he had lost over a month's pay troubled him less by far than
that he had lost repute. He had suffered much in pocket, but more in prestige. He had been
a successful player in the Columbia country, too much so for the good of scores of comrades,
but especially himself. He could have found it in his heart to throttle that guffawing clown,
whose rude bellow of rejoicing over Case's brilliant bluff and his own defeat, had brought
even the dago and his fellows in staring wonderment to the open door. He would have pledged
another month's pay could he have throttled the story he knew now would be going the rounds.
He was even more humiliated--far more--than they knew. They all would have shouted had they
seen the hand he laid down, but he had striven to carry it off jocosely, to say he had only
been bluffing, and was very properly caught at his own game. Oh, he had shown a game, sportsman-like
front, and had striven to pass it all off as a matter that worried him not in the least, but
Craney, clear-headed, believed otherwise, and Case, muddle-headed as he was by noon, knew better,
and had his reasons for knowing--reasons as potent as were those that moved him wholly to ignore
Willett's half-proffered hand.

Case had nothing in particular to do all day, and could sleep if so minded. Willett, not knowing
what moment he might be called upon to take active part in stirring service, should sleep,
and so prepare himself, yet could not. Case's personality, and Case's one reference to Vancouver,
two years previous, haunted and vexed him sorely. Where and under what circumstances had he
seen the man? Only for three weeks had he been at the fine old post referred to, while a big
court-martial was there in session, and he, with other subalterns, had come as witnesses. There
had been dinners and dancing and fun and flirtation, both at the post and in Portland. There
had been card-playing in which he was easy winner, and not a little of his winnings had gone
for wine. There had been foolish things said in pink little ears, and even written in silly
missives that now he would have been glad to recall, but--but no harm to him as yet had come
from them. There had even been a girl whom he had never seen before nor since that visit, nor
wanted to see again, nor hear from, yet from her he had heard, and more than once--piteous,
imploring little letters they were. But, heavens! he was busy hunting Indians when they began
to come, and then they had ceased to find him, rather to his relief, but none of these episodes
or epistles in any way included Case, yet somewhere he had seen him, somewhere he had heard
his voice, and somewhere Case had marked his method of play. Case said Vancouver, but though
two or three steep games had there or thereabouts occurred--games in which his soldier comrades
had withdrawn as too big for them--he, with his luck and brilliancy, had dared to pursue to
the end and came out envied as a winner. And still this did not seem to point to Case.

Not two hours' sleep did Willett get that Sunday morning. He was awake, hot, feverish, and
athirst at noon, craving ice, which could be seen in the mountains only a day's march away,
but had never yet been made to last through the homeward journey. Craney brought him a cool
and dripping canteen and some acetic acid, the best he could do, and had proffered bottled
beer, cooled in the big olla and retailed at fifty cents, but Willett sought information rather
than sleep, and indirectly inquired as to Case's antecedents. Inferentially, he wished Craney
to understand that he believed Case to be a professional, and Craney blamable for permitting
him to play. Craney saw the move and checkmated at once. "Case has had dozens of chances to
play--dozens of 'em--since I brought him here from Prescott, and never before has he sat into
anything bigger'n a dollar limit. He never would play in the other room. He came out as quartermaster's
clerk, nearly two years ago. With whom? Why, Major Ballard brought him out and had to turn
him loose for drinking. No, Ballard was never at Vancouver. Then my bookkeeper got shot in
a pay-day row and left the books in a muddle. I had to hire Case to come and balance them--best
accountant and bookkeeper I ever had--square to the marrow, though he wants one week off a
month, and is absolutely stalwart t'other three, but he will not talk of his past. Ballard
told me he came with tiptop letters from officers of rank in San Francisco, who said he was
incorruptible, even when he drank, whereas my clerk, who had been a model of sobriety, robbed
right and left. Case has gone off now, somewhere down among the willows, I reckon. He'll be
drunk for three days, sobering three days, and straight the seventh. If you hadn't started
him last night he'd be sober now. And if you hadn't come into it that family game would have
stopped at one, with nobody the worse nor wiser. You said you had no use for a dollar limit game."

There was no comfort, therefore, in Craney's visit. Willett took another cool bath, dressed
about two, and being shown the path Case generally followed, sauntered away, quite as though
he had nothing on his mind, and was presently lost beyond that same willowy screen. He at that
time, at least, was not thinking of 'Tonio and the lost trail.

At five the general, with Strong and Bonner, could be made out four miles away, riding back
from the peak. "I'll go a moment and inquire for Mr. Harris," said Mrs. Archer, "and ask the
doctor when we may visit him." So, leaving Lilian with Mrs. Stannard, and intending to be gone
but a few minutes, the gentle, anxious-hearted woman, sunshade in hand, went forth from the
shelter of the low veranda into the slanting, unclouded rays, and presently tapped lightly
at the doctor's open door. There was no answer, yet from somewhere within came sound of masculine
voices. Entering the dark hall, she tapped again at the entrance to the doctor's sitting-room,
or den. A Navajo blanket hung like a portière across the open space, for door there was none,
and, as no one came in answer to her modest signal, she ventured to push the curtain a bit
to one side and peer within. The room was but dimly lighted, all windows but one on the north
side being heavily draped. The doctor's reclining chair and reading table, the latter littered
with books, pamphlets and pipes, were visible through a reminiscent haze of not too fragrant
tobacco smoke, for the old predominated over the new. A rude sideboard stood over against her,
between the northward windows, and thereon was stationed a demi-john of goodly proportions,
with outlying pickets in the way of glasses. Bentley himself, though one of the old school,
was an abstemious man, and therefore enabled to have at all times a supply of reliable stimulant
for such of his callers as were of opposite faith. That some of that ilk had recently favored
him was presumptively evident, no more by the sideboard display than by the sound of voices
from an inner room, where two or three were uplifted in discussion, and neither was the doctor's.

Now, Mrs. Archer much wished to see young Harris, to assure him of their deep interest in his
welfare, of their desire to be of service to him, and their reason for not earlier intruding.
Gentle and unselfish though she was, there was distinct sense of chagrin that Mrs. Stannard,
or any woman, should have anticipated her coming. The doctor had promised to say just how soon
he could approve her seeing his patient, and it was the doctor's fault she had come no sooner.
Not until days thereafter did she know that Harris had asked for Mrs. Stannard. Not for even
a Christmas home-going would Mrs. Stannard have let her know it--but Mrs. Stannard was a rare,
rare woman.

But if the doctor thought it unwise that his patient should receive the visits of ministering
angels such as she and they, what, said Mrs. Archer to her stupefied self, could Dr. Bentley
mean by permitting the visits of such disturbers as these whose angering words came distinctly
to her ears? She stood, half-dazed, unable for a moment to determine what to do--whether to
enter at once--enter, and in the name of her husband, the commanding officer, enter emphatic
protest against such exciting language at such a time, in such a presence--or whether to retire
at once and hear no more of it. One voice, at the moment low and guarded, was that of a stranger--she
had never heard it before. The other, however, she knew instantly as that of Harold Willett.
No wonder she stood amazed, never doubting they were addressed to Harris, at the first words--Willett's
words--to reach her ears!

"You are in no condition now to talk to a gentleman, and I refuse to listen. You came here
to lie about me--to undermine me, and I know it, and the quicker you go----"

"I came here to speak God's truth and you know it!" came the instant answer, and in instant
relief she knew it was not the voice of Harris. "As to undermining--by God, it's to block your
undermining another and a better man I've come! If that isn't enough for you--to block your
doing here--what you did to that poor girl at Portland----"

But a rush and a scuffle, the sound of a blow, broke in upon the words, just as the attendant,
affrighted, came running out, just as Dr. Bentley, astounded and indignant, came hurrying in.
Mrs. Archer, in bewilderment, fell back into the sunshine, only presently to see Willett, flushed
and furious, hasten forth from the rear door and turn straightway to the adjutant's quarters
adjoining--only to be overtaken in a moment by the attendant, panting: "The doctor said would
Mrs. Archer please come back one minute, he'd like to speak with her." And Mrs. Archer turned
again and went.

CHAPTER XII.

Ten minutes later, when the general and his little escort came dustily into the garrison, his
first question on dismounting was for Willett, and it was Lilian who had to answer that she
believed he was at Mr. Strong's. So thither, with but brief, though kindly, word with Mrs.
Stannard, and as brief an expression of his satisfaction that Mrs. Archer had gone to see Harris,
the veteran took his way. The horses were led to stables. The other officers, hastening homeward,
bowing in hurried, perfunctory fashion to the ladies, turned again at sound of his voice, and
all three together entered the adjutant's house, an orderly remaining at the door. Lilian looked
anxiously after them and Mrs. Stannard inquiringly. "They have seen something, I know," said
the girl, "and something father is puzzled about. He would not have come and gone without a
kiss." Already Mrs. Stannard had noted his fond custom, had marked its omission now when, ever
since luncheon, he had been away, and she, too, divined that he was preoccupied, even perplexed.
But once already she had too quickly spoken her thoughts, and there must be no more of that.
In three minutes the little party came forth again, Willett with them now, and, field-glasses
in hand, away they strode to the northward edge of the plateau and went speedily along toward
a point at the back of the hospital where there stood a little platform, railed about with
untrimmed pine, a rustic lookout much affected by the men in the long evenings, but seldom
visited when the sun was up. It took no time at all for half the remaining garrison to turn
out and, at respectful distance, stand curiously watching them, and little more for the other
half to come flocking out of doors. "Seen somethin' from way up on the Picacho," explained
the orderly, as he jogged by with the heated horses, "an' came back akiting!"

Two minutes more and the adjutant, Strong, came running from the platform. "Don't unsaddle,"
he shouted. "Bring those horses back and get some more! Send the escort up here at once!"

The officers at the lookout had not even unslung their pistol belts, and Willett now was seen
to set down his binocular and start away. The general called to him and he half turned and
hurriedly answered: "Back just as quick as I can get my Colt, sir." He was unfastening his
blouse at the throat as he went, and even at the distance men could see how hot and flushed
he looked, while the others seemed so hard, "tried out" and fit for anything. Presently the
half dozen horsemen, who had been with their chief to the Picacho, came trotting forth from
the corral, followed by two or three led horses. Strong mounted the first to reach him and
sent another to his quarters for Lieutenant Willett. Then Captain Bonner came strolling back
as though quite unconcerned. "May as well get the men under arms," said he to his alert first
sergeant, and away went every man of Company "C" on a run for the barracks.

"Needn't wait for Willett," the general was heard calling to Strong, who, with a little party,
sat in saddle eagerly awaiting orders. So down the slope they went, just as the doctor and
Mrs. Archer, apprised in some way of the excitement, came forth and saw the dust cloud in their
wake, and the snorting troop horse pawing the sand in front of Strong's. Old Bucketts, the
quartermaster, came limping up the line, his florid features a deeper red, and all he could
tell in answer to question was, "They see something beyond the Point. Who's that horse for,
orderly?"

"Loot'nt Willett, sir--said he'd be out in a minute."

But the minutes proved long, and Bucketts went in to help, if need be, and to get information,
if possible. Willett had kicked off his fine uniform trousers and ununiform Oxfords, and was
cursing the striker who had hidden his scouting rig. "Why the devil didn't you go as you were?"
asked Bucketts unsympathetically. "They're raising the dust far as the ford already. What's
up, anyhow?"

"Can't tell! Don't know! Nobody knows! They send scouts out--couriers out--messengers out,
and spend hours wishing somebody'd come with news, and then when somebody's seen coming get
rattled and send half the garrison out to meet----"

But suddenly catching sight of the disapprobation on his caller's face, Willett broke off short.
No wonder Buckett's looked astonished at such language from a staff officer. Nor was that veteran
questioner long in sizing up the cause. It added nothing to his respect for Willett, and not
a little to his concern. He knew by this time, as did almost every man except the post commander,
how and where Willett spent the night and morning--knew that he had left the store only an
hour or so previous, as though to follow and find the bookkeeper--knew that Case had been drinking,
and saw now that Willett had been following suit. Without a word on that head, or another question
as to the causes of the excitement, he stumped about the premises, busying himself in hunting
for the missing items, and presently found them hanging under a calico curtain that Willett
had already nearly torn down in unsuccessful, unseeing search. "Here you are," he said, tossing
the garments on the bed. "Here's your pistol, Colt's 44; every chamber loaded and ready for
business. You'll use a different belt when you've been a month in Arizona--and you'll shed
top boots for 'Patchie moccasins. Let me help you, Willett. You're a bit blown. Here, douse
your head in that----" and as he spoke Bucketts half filled a bowl and went limping out to
the olla for more and cooler water, leaving Willett fussing at his riding breeches and damning
Strong's striker for being away among the gaping, staring, empty-headed gang at the bluff at
the moment he was most needed.

As Bucketts was lifting the vessel from the cool depths of the hanging reservoir, he heard
his name faintly called, and there, at the side door of the doctor's quarters, pale and suffering,
barefooted and mantled with a sheet, his arm and shoulder bandaged, stood Harris.

"Tell Willett to come out," he said. "I must see him before he goes."

"You go back to bed. I'll tell him," but Harris stood his ground despite the fact that the
attendant had laid a hand upon his unbound shoulder, and was begging him to return. Bucketts
set the pitcher inside the door. "Here's cooler water, Willett," he said, "and here's Harris
at the door--says he must see you before you start."

Then, without waiting for answer, the quartermaster hurried along the path to the front in
search of the doctor; saw him far over back of the hospital, heading for the platform; saw
Mrs. Archer, on her own veranda by this time, in eager talk with Mrs. Stannard, and Lilian
drooping at the corner pillar; hurried back to get his stick and to further rebuke Harris,
when, afar down to the south-east came the sound of a shot, half-muffled by distance, and,
gazing from the rear end of the little gallery, he saw, a mile or more away across the stream
and skirting the willows, two horsemen coming at top speed; saw, emerging from the willows
at the near side of the ford, a man who walked heavily through the yielding sand, holding his
hand to his face. He, too, had heard the shot and was making, 'cross lots, for home. It was
Case, the bookkeeper, disturbed, perhaps, said Bucketts, in his siesta among the willows and
doing his best to gain shelter. Before Case could get a fourth of the way across the barren
flat, tacking perceptibly among the cactus and grease wood, the riders burst in sight again
and went lashing away to the store--two ranchmen or prospectors, said Bucketts, and they've
been having the time of their life getting in. 'Tonio said the Tontos were all about them,
and here was additional proof. The last Bucketts saw of Case he was lurching on toward the
store, but, just then, buttoning his riding jacket and girding on his revolver belt, out came
Willett.

"Well, what is it?" was his brief, almost sullen question. And then came his classmate's answer--one
that Bucketts long remembered.

"You are going up the valley, I take it, and there is an alarm of some kind. Now, Willett,
remember this: no matter what you have seen or suspect, the Apache-Mohaves had no part in the
devil's work at Bennett's. I have 'Tonio's word for it, and will bring proofs."

"Damn 'Tonio's word! He's a renegade and a deserter himself! He's playing a deep, double game,
and you yourself suspected it three days ago. Now he's proved it. I've no time to talk." And
impatiently he turned away and sprang for his horse. A moment more and he was in saddle, had
set spurs to his excited mount, and then, full gallop, went tearing to the edge of the mesa,
lifted his hat in salutation to the general, and dove down the slope, across the lower bench,
away through an upper ford of the sluggish winter stream, and out upon the sandy flats beyond.

"Rides well," said the general, looking after him.

"Rides very well," said the surgeon, looking after Strong. "Can you see anything yet, sir?"

"Could see two horses ten minutes ago, with some running figures far up the valley. Can't make
'em out at all. Strong'll fetch 'em--Strong and Willett. Good stock there, doctor!"

"Tiptop, where Strong is concerned," said the doctor grimly. The events of the earlier afternoon
had tended to add to his disapprobation of the other. "There's something up at the store, sir,
I think," he added, with a swift change of subject. "I saw men running that way just now. Here
comes Bucketts!"

And Bucketts came, hobbling sturdily. "It's two ranchmen, I think, and there was a shot down
toward the south-east ten minutes ago."

The general looked back. Down in front of the log barracks Bonner's company, in fatigue dress,
had formed ranks, and the sergeants were distributing ammunition. Across the parade, the verandas
of the Mess and office buildings were deserted, but one or two men stood staring toward the
invisible plant of the trader. Close at hand, near the hospital and again lining the edge of
the mesa, a score of yards farther to the left, a number of soldiers of the other company were
eagerly watching developments. Even with the naked eye, two miles or more up the valley, Strong's
little detachment, black dots of skirmishers, could occasionally be sighted pushing on northward,
while, at heavy gallop, heading for the front, Willett was still in plain view; but, at the
moment, nothing could be seen of the objects that were the original cause of the excitement.

From the Picacho, it seems, both Strong and Bonner had made out through their glasses two tiny
black dots in the direction of Bennett's ruined ranch, coming slowly toward the post, but still
five or six miles away. From the platform, forty minutes later, two horsemen had distinctly
been seen moving swiftly about, close to the willows that lined, in places, the rocky stream
bed. More than this, the general was sure he had caught sight of three or four figures afoot,
skipping actively about when moving at all. What he and his advisers believed was that Sergeant
Woodrow and his comrades were, for some reason, trying to make their way back to Almy and had
found Apaches barring the way. Therefore had Strong and his little party been sent forth to
meet, to aid, to bring them in. Therefore had Willett, of his own motion this time, and without
the delegated authority he bore when following Harris, set forth at speed to overtake them,
forgetful, in the eagerness of the moment and the possible over-excitement of his faculties,
that he had promised Archer to be back just as soon as he'd got his Colt--that calibre 44 Colt
now belted at his hip, with every chamber loaded.

And now as the eager watchers at the platform trained their glasses on the distant field, Bucketts,
taking up the handsome binocular left by the aide-de-camp, had time to notice its fine silver
mounting and the engraved "H. Willett, U.S.A.," in exactly the same script as that which adorned
the revolver. Then, as he adjusted it to his eyes, it occurred to him to tell the doctor of
Harris's coming to the side door, and of his most earnest language and manner, whereat the
general turned sharply:

"What's that? Harris said no Apache-Mohaves?"

"No Apache-Mohaves in the affair at Bennett's Ranch, sir, on 'Tonio's authority, and Willett
scoffed at both statement and 'Tonio."

"By heaven," said Archer, "'Tonio was right in saying we were cut off, isolated here, and if
he hadn't slipped away in that mysterious fashion I'd rather take his word than--than Willett's
impressions. Where has Willett been--all morning--anyhow? He never came near me!"

Everybody within earshot knew, and nobody answered. Archer looked queerly about him. Bonner
and Briggs gazed fixedly through their glasses. Bucketts was absorbed in the adjustment of
his. The doctor said he must go over and give Harris a rebuke for getting up, and started forthwith,
and Archer, without further question, turned again to his survey. He was of the old army--and
knew the signs.

For a moment every living object up the valley seemed to be shut from view. Bonner, by way
of changing the subject, had so far "white-lied" as to exclaim "There they are again!--er--no,"
but the ruse was unnecessary; Archer understood. Almost at the moment, however, came a sound
from the open windows of the matron's room, adjoining the hospital, against which all present
would willingly have closed their ears--the prolonged, heart-breaking, moaning cry of a woman
robbed of all she held dearest--poor Mrs. Bennett waking once more to her direful sorrows,
and filling the air with her hopeless wail. For a moment it dominated all other sound. "For
heaven's sake, doctor," cried Archer to the assistant, "can't you and Bentley devise something
to still that poor creature? Has she lost her mind, too?"

"Sounds like it, sir. There's only one thing that will bring it back--that's those babies."

"If anybody can get 'em it will be Stannard," answered the general prayerfully. "This, whatever
it is, up the valley may be news from him and of them! God grant it!"

"Look!" cried Bonner at the instant. "I see Willett! See him?--galloping up that---- Why, hell
and blazes--I beg your pardon, general--he's 'way out beyond Strong's people! See 'em--down
there by the willows? Where in---- Gad! d'ye see that? Why, his horse jumped and shied as if
he'd---- Look! He's running away! He's gone!"

Gone he had. Not once again, before the going down of the sun, now just tangent to the western
heights, did they catch sight of Willett or Willett's horse. One after another the watchers
again found Strong within the field of vision and followed him down to and across the stream,
and others of the mounted party were seen, some wearily following their officer, others moving
about a point among the willows where last had been seen the two strangers whose odd movements
led to the going forth of the searching party. But it was half an hour later, and light was
growing dim in the valley, while the eastward crests of the Mogollon were all ablaze, when
a single rider was made out coming homeward at speed. It was dusk at Almy when his panting
horse struggled painfully up the slope and, dismounting, a weary rider saluted the post commander
and handed him a note. By this time Mrs. Archer, Mrs. Stannard and Lilian, too, were on the
platform, and the mother's arm stole instinctively about the daughter's slender waist, while
every eye was on the general as he quickly opened, then slowly read aloud the pencilled words:

    "We have the couriers safe. They are from up the Verde, badly
    scared and worn out. Say they have been chased by Indians ever
    since three o'clock, were almost out of ammunition. Lieutenant
    Willett, venturing too far on the east side, while we were to the
    west of the stream, must have encountered some of them. We heard
    firing, and followed. Found his horse dead among the rocks and
    Willett lying near, stunned, but certainly not shot. Could see
    nothing of his assailants. Ambulance needed. Respectfully,

    "STRONG."

Mrs. Archer's arm wound still closer about her daughter's trembling form. Lilian said no word,
but her face was white, her soft lips were quivering. Mrs. Stannard sympathetically closed
in on the other side, as the general gave brief directions, and presently, between the two,
the girl walked slowly away, only the general following with his eyes. Bentley went back once
again to quietly tell the news to Harris, but was ready when the ambulance stopped at his door.
Lilian had been persuaded to go and lie down, said Mrs. Archer, when her grave-faced husband
came home at dark. "That is best," was all he said, but he turned and took his fond wife's
face between his hands and kissed it thrice, then went forth again to meet the coming couriers.
It seems their orders were to deliver their despatch in person to the commander of Camp Almy,
and, sending them on for refreshments, he read by the light of a lantern the message from the
commander of the District of the Verde. Young warriors by the hundred were out, said the agent
at the reservation, even the Apache-Mohaves. Mail messengers, ranch people and others had been
murdered close to Camp Sandy. Friendly Indians report soldiers killed in Dead Man's Cañon in
revenge for death of Comes Flying, accidentally shot. Captain Tanner and Lieutenant Ray are
out from Camps Sandy and Cameron, with strong commands, and will try to communicate with Almy.
"Nothing has been heard of Lieutenant Harris and his scouts," said the despatch, "but rumors
are rife as to Indian depredations near you. It is feared that in your advanced position you
may be surrounded, and communication cut off, but no fears are entertained as to your ability
to take care of yourself. If you still have cavalry scouting in the Tonto basin, warn them
of conditions and report when possible."

"So much for so much," said the general. "Now for Willett," and a mile farther out he met the
ambulance coming in, Willett and the doctor aboard, the former with a broken collar-bone and
a bad headache. Moreover, Willett was in vicious mood.

"General Archer," said he, "the shot that killed my horse was meant for me, and the Indian
who fired the shot was Harris's paragon, 'Tonio."

CHAPTER XIII.

That was a stirring night at Almy. The general, contrary to habit, was very grave and quiet,
saying little, drinking nothing, even the customary toddy being declined. The doctor, also
contrary to habit, was drinking a little and thinking a lot, but saying nothing. An abstemious
man, as a rule, and a temperate man at all times, he seemed inclined to sample his Monongahela
more than once before midnight, when, having gotten his patients to sleep, he tried to do likewise.
"They are on an even keel again," said Bonner, referring to the two casuals, "and I am not
sorry to see it." Evidently there had been comparison of notes between Strong and Bonner, and
an agreement of some kind, for both held that Willett had exceeded his authority, as well as
his discretion, in conducting a single-handed charge on an outnumbering enemy, secretly hidden
behind rocks and ridges. Strong's men said that Lieutenant Willett, spurring hard, had called
across the stream for them to follow him, and three of those nearest the bank plunged through
the shallows and were barely three hundred yards behind him when, from their right front among
the rocks at the foot of a bluff, the shot was fired that wounded the lieutenant's horse, which
veered at once and ran away down among the willows. No, they hadn't charged. They turned, too.
For all they knew, there might have been a thousand Apaches in hiding there, and when the lieutenant
turned they turned. It was not until Lieutenant Strong and the rest of the men came up with
them that they pushed ahead and found the officer and his horse lying among the rocks by the
stream. Willett had been hurled out of saddle when the frenzied beast went suddenly down, and
there he lay, stunned and bleeding, while the poor brute was quivering in the agonies of death.

"Did you see anything of 'Tonio?" Strong was asked, as a matter of course.

"Not so much as a shred of his breechclout," said Strong, "nor of any other Indian nearer than
a mile away, and they were running for the rocks. It was too dark to do any trailing." But
for the shot that killed Willett's horse, and the tremendous tales of the courier scouts, Strong
would have been inclined to say there were not a dozen Indians in the north valley. "If there
were more," said he, "and if they were really hostile, even though afoot as they were, was
it likely that two couriers on worn-out horses could have escaped them? No," said Strong. "There
is something about it we don't understand, neither does Willett, for all he's so positive."

But Strong admitted that two things puzzled him. The horse was certainly shot, and Willett's
Colt, the handsome revolver that he set such store by, was certainly gone. Willett, when he
came to, had asked for it. He swore that he had drawn it from the holster, and was riding at
"raise pistol" when the shot was fired--that he clutched it as his maddened horse tore blindly
down the slope, and then, among the rocks, stumbled, staggered and fell. Now revolver, holster,
"thimble belt" of cartridges--all were gone.

The couriers were made to tell their tale while the doctor and his assistants were getting
Willett to bed, and Willett, from several conditions, was not easy to soothe and quiet. He
had not been sparing of the spiritus frumenti that went with other medical supplies in the
ambulance. Archer and the surgeon saw it, and said nothing. That was natural, possibly, under
the circumstances, and could be controlled later. Archer cross-questioned the couriers at some
length. They had not followed the Verde Valley southward. They had "lit out" along the Mesa
road, toward Baker's Butte, until they found the trail by way of Hardscrabble and Granite Creek.
They had succeeded in evading Apaches until the third day out, and after leaving the East Fork
they saw smokes that made them wary, and once down in the Wild Rye Valley, and in sight of
the old Picacho, they came upon recent Indian signs in the sand--moccasin tracks going down
stream bed toward the post. Then they "chassayed," as they said, out into the open, midway
to the foothills, so as to keep out of rifle range of both, and then Indians came a-running
at them from the foothills, trying to head them off and take them alive, they supposed, and
they had dismounted and fought and driven them back, and, oh, they must have killed three or
four of 'em! and in fact had had to fight for their lives most of the afternoon. Archer listened,
incredulous, puzzled. Frontiersmen's and fishermen's tales have much in common. These were
men who had been employed three years, they said, by the agent at the upper reservation and
had been detailed for courier duty with Colonel Pelham, commanding the district of the Verde.
One was American, the other Mexican. Their story might be straight, but, with all the valor
to which they laid claim, it seemed strange to Archer and his officers that two men could break
their way through an encircling horde of hostiles such as they described, and hold a hundred
fierce Apaches four long hours at bay.

Harris was awake, and in highly nervous condition, and begging that he might be allowed to
see and question these couriers, but both doctors, regular and contract, said no, not this
night. And so, toward midnight, the couriers were permitted to go to bed. The doubled sentries
were cautioned to observe the utmost vigilance. The lights were extinguished at the store,
by way of telling everybody that neither game nor glass was to be had before the morrow. The
general was urged by his devoted adherents, Bonner, Bucketts and Strong, to get such sleep
as was possible, and the post was committed to the charge of Lieutenant Briggs, officer of
the day. The lights were still burning low at the hospital and in the doctor's quarters and
Strong's, as, with a look about the moonlit valley and a word to his sergeant, Bonner rejoined
his comrades at the quartermaster's veranda.

"Odd," said he, with a tilt of his head toward the quarters next beyond, "of all our little
fighting force, so far the only casualties are with our two casuals."

That was at one o'clock in the morning. At three, by which time all but the guard were presumably
in bed, Mrs. Archer, lying anxious and wakeful, listening for the sound of sigh or sob from
Lilian's little room and praying that sorrow might be averted from that beloved child, felt
sure at last that she heard a footstep, and, stealing softly across the narrow hallway, found
Lilian kneeling at the curtained window and gazing out upon the brilliant night. There was
no reproach in the mother's murmured words. Well she knew what it portended that her daughter
should be at this hour sleepless and striving, perhaps, to see the light from the window where
her young hero lay prostrate and suffering. Not one word had they yet exchanged about him,
but many a woman, even with mother love brimming over in her heart, would have upbraided, and
many another would have "nagged." What other word have we for that feminine method, the resort
of so very many, the remedy of so very few? But Mrs. Archer simply circled a loving arm about
the slender form. "We're all on guard to-night, aren't we, daughter?" she murmured, fondly
kissing the tear-wet cheek. "It was so long before your father dropped to sleep. Have you--heard
anything?"

Burying her face in the dear refuge of years, with her arms thrown instantly about her mother's
neck, Lilian's sole answer was a shake of the bonny head. It was as much as saying, "You know
that isn't the matter; yet, thank you for trying to think so--thank you for not asking me what is."

"Well, I did," murmured Mrs. Archer, slowly rising to her feet, and drawing Lilian with her.
"I'm sure I heard low voices down there on the flat toward the ford. The sentries are more
than usually watchful and taking note of everything. You know it was right out there Number
Five heard the crying in the willows only last night." Face there was slowly, and, spree,. A way had

An righteous, render most, rejoiced.

 You say you have been unable to
communicate with Stannard or Turner. Stannard is, probably, too far away, but if Turner's wounded
are over on Tonto Creek, he can be reached. Have you tried signalling?"

"Signalling? We've got some flags and torches somewhere, but I believe that----"

"I don't mean that, sir. No one with Turner would understand if we had. I mean smoke signals--Indian."

"No," said Archer slowly. "No one but Indians could say what they meant, even if any one here
knew their confounded code. Do you?"

"I know enough at least to call 'Tonio; and unless he is dead or spirited away, he'll answer.
Then we can get word to Turner."

Archer turned back. He was almost at the door. "Do you mean he would answer--that he would
come in here?"

"If I may give my word that no one shall touch or harm him, he'll come--if alive and able."

For a moment the general was silent. It was a grave question. In his eyes and those of his
officers, 'Tonio stood attainted practically with treason. He had deserted in face of the enemy,
joined forces with the enemy, shot as an enemy, conspired and acted as an enemy. He deserved
to be hunted and shot down without trial, without mercy. Yet here was this young soldier, who
had known him best and longest, full of boundless faith in him, demanding safe conduct for
him on the honor of an officer and gentleman. If Archer gave his word it would be flying in
the face of his entire command--what there was left of it, at least--and Archer's word was
a thing not to be lightly given. "I must think of this awhile," said he. "It is a big proposition.
You think you can reach him?"

"By night or day, sir, either; but it would have to be from the top of Squadron Peak."

It was then late on Friday afternoon, the fifth day of what might he called the siege. Not
a signal had come from without, not a sign from either command, not a symptom of surrounding
Indian; yet a little party sent to search the rookery down stream, where Case declared he'd
been entertaining the ghost of 'Patchie Sanchez, came back reporting that fresh moccasin and
mule tracks were plainly visible about the premises and at the neighboring ford, also that
the mule tracks led away back of the Picacho, as everybody persisted in calling the peak--in
spite of the fact that from the north it presented no sharp point to the skies, but rather
a bold and rounded poll. Squadron Peak was more "sonorous and appropriate," said the trooper
who so named it, but now that troopers were scarce at Almy, there were none to do it that reverence.

Old Sanchez--José--the former proprietor, had disappeared entirely, he and his brace of henchmen,
after somewhere digging a treasure pit in the sand and therein "caching" their store of mescal,
aguardiente, and certain other illicit valuables. It was conjectured that he had fled to the
Verde Valley and taken refuge at McDowell until the storm blew over. But Craney was more than
curious as to Case's guest, the ghost, and by Friday Case was sober and solemn and sick enough
to be cross-questioned without show of resentment. Craney went so far as to ask Case wouldn't
he like a little whiskey to steady his nerves--a cocktail to aid his appetite and stir his
stomach? "Like it," said Case, "you bet I would--which is why I won't take it. Three days'
liquor, two days' taper, one day suffer, then the water wagon for a spell. Thank you all the
same, Mr. Craney. What can I do for you without the drink?"

But when Craney mentioned Sanchez, the ghost and the drinking bout by night at the rookery,
Case said he must have been nigher to jimjams than he'd got in a year. "I never saw any ghost,"
said he, and Craney had to give it up, and report his failure to the commanding officer.

"Ever try threatening him with discharge?" asked Bucketts, by way of being helpful.

"Ever try? I don't have to try! The one time I started in on that lay he never let me finish;
said all right, he'd go just as soon as he'd balanced the books. Then, by gad, it was all I
could do to get him to stay. He is the most independent damn man I ever met. Says he knows
he's a drunkard and nuisance one week out of four, and don't wonder I want to discharge him.
Discharge him? I couldn't get along without him! Any time he wants a better job and plenty
of society all he's got to do is go to Prescott. Discharge him! All I'm afraid of is he'll
discharge himself!"

So Bucketts dropped the subject and he and Strong went to report non-success to Archer just
as the sun was going down and the peak, in lone grandeur, loomed up dazzling above the black
drapery about its base, and Bonner, pacing up and down with his much-honored chief, saw the
gloom deepen in his deep-set eyes. Only Lilian seemed able to win a smile from him, as she
came and took him by the arm and led him away to dinner.

Darkness settled down apace. The moon rose late and the stars were holding high carnival in
consequence, for the skies were gorgeous in their deck of gold. Mrs. Stannard was dining with
the Archers en famille, as she did now almost every evening, for the Archers would so have
it, and Archer had been talking of Harris's proposition, and his determined stand for 'Tonio.
Mrs. Archer shook her pretty head in negation. She could not see how any one who distrusted
her general could himself be loyal. She had said the same of Secretary Stanton during the war,
for one of that iron master's most masterly convictions was that every soldier, Southern born--even
such as Thomas--must of necessity be a Southern sympathizer. 'Tonio must needs be a traitor
since he avoided sight of, or speech with, her soldier who could do no wrong. And if Mrs. Archer
believed in 'Tonio, on her husband's account, what must have been Lilian's conviction? she
who had both father and lover--father and the husband soon to be, for of that Mrs. Archer had
now no earthly doubt--the two men beyond all others combined who were dearest to Lilian on
earth, both of them inimical to 'Tonio, one of them wellnigh his victim. It was Mrs. Stannard
who listened in silence. She had longer known the Apache-Mohave, and as between 'Tonio and
Willett it might well be a story with two sides.

They had finished their coffee and were just coming forth upon the veranda into the exquisite
evening air, and, as bidden by her father, Lilian had just begun to tune her guitar, when across
the parade among the men seated along the low front of the barracks there was sudden start,
sudden rush, and, from up the line of officers' quarters not many doors away, came agonized
cry for help. Archer sprang to his feet and started, but Mrs. Archer, in a paroxysm of fear,
thinking only of Indians and treachery, seized him by the arm, clung to and held him. Mrs.
Stannard sprang within the hall and back with Archer's revolver which, without a word, she
thrust into his hand. Then all three together started, for while fifty men came tearing headlong
across the sandy level, making straight for the adjutant's quarters, Lilian, their little Lilian--the
silent, sad-eyed, anxious child of the days and days gone by--heading everybody, was flying
like a white-winged bird, straight along the line, and when the father reached her she had
thrown herself upon a heap of burning, smouldering bedding, thrashing it with a wet blanket
snatched from the olla, and then, with her own fair, white hands, was beating out the few sparks
that remained about the sleeve and shoulder of a soaked and dishevelled gown, and brushing
others from the hair and face of an unheroic, swathed and dripping figure--Harold Willett in
the midst of the wreck of his cot, while Blitz, the striker, aided by Wettstein and the doctor's
man, were stamping and swearing and tearing things to bits in the effort to down other incipient
blazes. Between them they had dragged Willett from the midst of the flames and drenched him
with a cataract from the olla. The rush of the men from the barracks made short work of the
fire, but when Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Stannard, with throbbing hearts, bent over the scorched
and smoking ruin on the south porch, a tousled brown head, with ghastly face, was clasped in
Lilian's arms, pillowed on Lilian's fair, white bosom. Willett had fainted from fright, pain
and reaction, and the unheroic, untried, unfearing girl had blistered her own fair hands, her
own soft, rounded, clasping arms, yet saw and felt nothing but dread for his suffering and
joy for his safety. Even the mother for a moment could not take her rescued darling from that
fond, fearless, impassioned embrace. All in that desperate instant the veil of virgin shame
had burned away. In the fierce heat and shock and peril the latent love force had burst its
bonds, the budding lily had blossomed into womanhood.

And upon that picture, pallid, weak and suffering, another neighbor, another pain-stricken
young soldier gazed in silence, then turned unobtrusively away. There was no one to help him
back to the reclining chair from which he had been startled at the almost frenzied shriek of
alarm. There was no further talk--no thought of signals that night; Archer had had enough of
fire. They bore the reviving officer, presently, to a vacant room in Stannard's quarters, and
Lilian was led to her own. There were bandages about both hands and arms when next morning
she appeared upon the gallery. They hid the red ravages on the fair, white skin, but what was
there to veil the radiant light that shone in her eyes, the burning blushes that mantled her
soft and rounded cheeks? Archer took her to his heart and kissed her and turned to his duty
with a sigh. Mrs. Archer clung to and hovered about her, silent, for what was there to say?
Mrs. Stannard came over, all smiles and sunshine, to announce that "He" had passed a comfortable
night, and "His" first waking thoughts and words were for her, as indeed they should have been,
and, so far as audible words were concerned, they possibly were. What else could Mrs. Stannard
have said when she saw that winsome, yet appealing little face?

And in such wise was our Lilian wooed; in such wise was she won. Contrary to Bentley's wishes,
Willett had essayed to smoke, and so set his bed afire. Contrary to all convention, the love
of the maiden had been the first to manifest itself to public eye, but Willett manfully rose
to the occasion. In the midst of anxiety, uncertainty and danger there beamed one ray, at least,
of radiant, unshadowed, buoyant hope and bliss and shy delight. Lilian Archer envied no girl
on the face of the globe, no white-robed seraph in heaven; and for her sake others, too, strove
hard to hope, to help, to shower good wishes and congratulation.

"But to think of my little girl in love," said Archer, with brimming eyes. "Why, you--you won't
be nineteen!"

"And mother was but seventeen when she married you," softly laughed Lilian, snuggling to his side.

"And Mr. Willett so far from his captaincy," sighed her mother.

"Much nearer than father was to even a first lieutenancy when you married him," was the joyous
answer. "He was only a second lieutenant by brevet."

"Well," said Mrs. Archer, "it seems different--somehow."

And so it seemed to us. "All too brief a wooing," said poor Archer. "God send her longer wedded
bliss!"

CHAPTER XVI.

Moreover, as some one said in speaking of the sudden engagement, "It came about on a Friday
evening, didn't it?" And then, too, when people were talking it over a few weeks later, as
Mrs. Archer said, "it seemed different." Soldier folk sometimes have superstitions as surely
as the sailor man is never without his, and a start on a voyage of love life, clearing port
of a Friday evening, had its inauspicious side. But for the mishap that suddenly enveloped
the happy man in flames at a moment when he was sprawled on his back with his whole right side,
as it were, in a sling, Mr. Harold Willett might indeed have returned to duty and department
headquarters with no other encumbrance than a mortgaged pay account, and it was not fair to
Lilian to speak of her engagement as "announced" that Friday evening; but in her wondrous happiness
she could find no fault with anything about it. It was all just perfect, just heavenly (where
they neither give nor are given in marriage, which possibly accounts, as said our cynic, for
so much that is heavenly about it). As an engagement, in fact, it did not exist until four
days later, after other and equally important things had occurred, and we have merely taken
Lilian's point of view, and left them out of that chapter and all consideration, as she did,
so far as we are concerned, in order to have it all over and done with. But of course there
had to be time for Willett to recover from the effects of the shock, to be clothed in his right
mind and something less fragmentary than the relics of a robe de nuit, and a day in which to
realize what had taken place. (I shrewdly suspect that our good friend Mrs. Stannard saw to
it that Mr. Willett was informed of what Lilian had done and suffered on his account, if she
did not dilate on what Lilian had betrayed.) And then came his very properly worded plea to
be allowed to see her and thank her; and when there was equally proper demur on Mrs. Archer's
part, Willett made his avowal in what even the mother held to be manly and convincing fashion,
for, now that she knew that her darling's heart was gone--that it was too late to avert the
inevitable--mother-like, she strove to see with her darling's eyes all that was good in him,
and there was so very much that was good-looking. She never even hinted to her husband, much
less to Lilian, that she had heard the paragon most vehemently accused of most unmanly and
unbecoming conduct (for what was Mr. Case, after all, but an irresponsible inebriate?), and
she saw that her daughter's happiness was wrapped up in this brilliant and most presentable
young soldier. Willett certainly gave many a promise of eminence in his career and profession,
so she set herself at once to work to talk the general into complaisance, and he, who loved
her with all his heart, and believed her the best, the bravest, fondest, truest wife in all
the army (as indeed she might have been without being the wisest), and who could deny Lilian
nothing from the time she turned his best silken sash into a swing for herself and Wauwataycha
Two Bears, her tiny Sioux playmate, till now that she had set her heart on one Harold Willett
for a husband, broke down and surrendered as ordered. But there was that in the old soldier's
face as he took Willett's hand that made the junior wince more than did the grip, which was
mild enough. "She will be just such another wife as is her blessed mother," said Archer. "Be
good and true to her, Willett."

"I will, so help me God!" said Willett solemnly, and then, at least, he meant it.

There had been an awkward little conference, an impromptu affair, at the mess the morning after
the alarm of fire. Willett stock had been running down before that episode, and went "plumb
out of sight" for several hours. It was held by Bonner, Bucketts, Briggs and Strong a most
womanish thing on his part to have raised such a row and then "wilted." It was Bentley, the
most disgusted man at the post, who now came to the rescue. "He was dumped on the porch like
a sack of potatoes," said he, "and probably suffered exquisite pain, let alone the burns and
the shock." Then, bunglingly, as bachelors will, and bachelors two of them were, they began
to talk of the revelation that met their eyes and what it portended. No one, as yet, had told
"the Old Man" of Willett's night at the store, and now no man would do it. Bygones were bygones.
Willett would be up in a week or so, the better, perhaps, for enforced rest and abstinence,
and now, of course, there could and would be no more of--of that sort of thing, and all his
better traits would shine by contrast with his probably temporary lapse into frivolity. Even
then, however, they wondered what Harris would think, and speculated as to what he would say.
Bucketts had not guessed amiss when he said there was no love lost between the classmates.
Bucketts, and all, had seen how much both the young men had been attracted by Lilian's grace
and beauty, and the sweet, girlish freshness that proved such a charm. 'it'came element were barely dangerous

 One hour later, just as ten was striking on the spiral of the office clock,
two sudden shots were heard on the flats to the north-west, and the little herd of horses and
mules, not two dozen in all, grazing under cover of the rifles of Sentries 3 and 4, came limping,
lumbering in, fast as hoppled feet would permit and without sign of a herdsman. Number Three,
a veteran of the war days, let drive with his fifty calibre Springfield, the gun of the day,
and sent up a yell for "The Guard!"

"Join your companies, men," said the general, in his placid way, whereat most of them went
with a rush. "The north side first, Bonner," he added, as the captain came hurrying to his
chief. "They've sneaked up on the herd guard, I fancy. Send the picked shots out to the pits."

Out on the flats to the west of the Verde road, full five hundred yards away from rock, tree
or shelter, other than mere clump of cactus, pumpkin size, or bunch of dirty weed, there was
lying a little heap of dingy white and brown, with a cow pony kicking at empty air in a shallow
ditch--what was left of the half-breed herd guard and his mount. With most of the cavalry gone,
the quartermaster had supplied their place with such mounted men as he could make available,
and in broad daylight, within long rifle-shot of the sentry lines, the Apaches had squirmed
out, snake-like, on their bellies, unseen, unsuspected; had picked off one of two watchers
and stampeded the other. The skirmish line stumbled over the survivor, quaking among the willows
in the stream bed, and kicked him out into the open to help bear home his murdered brother;
then pushed out as far as the first ridge in hopes of a shot, and were rewarded with nothing
better than a glimpse of vanishing breech-clouts. Falling slowly back, toward noon, Bonner
posted two men in each of a dozen rifle-pits, some fifty yards outside the sentry lines, as
a rule, and wherever view of the approaches could be had. Two of these were on little knolls
to the south of the store, and here were Craney & Co. in full force, every man armed with a
Henry rifle and a war-model Colt, "Mr. Case-Keeper Book," as Sergeant Clancy jovially hailed
him, quite as formidable as his fellows, and every whit as cool. Craney held that he and his
men had a right to be counted in among those told off to hold the fort, and Bonner smilingly
assented.

"You two seem to hit it off pretty well together," said he to Case and Clancy. "I reckon we'll
Cossack you over yonder," and he pointed to a scooped-out little hummock nearest the stream,
commanding much of the southward road and the trail along the willows, now facetiously termed
the "Ghost Walk." It was an unusual assignment, or distribution, but it seemed to strike the
fancy of both. In times of peril and at the fore-posts men think less of rank and more of repute.
Clancy was known far and wide as a fearless Apache fighter, with a Gaines's Mill-Gettysburg
record behind him. Case had never before been heard of afield, but his one exploit in the card
room stamped him unerringly, said these frontier experts, as "a man of nerve." Clancy held
out his big red hand. "Are ye with me?" said he. "Yours truly," said Case. "Then come on, Pitkeeper,"
said Clancy, "and we'll leave Book and Case behind."

The general came jogging down at the moment, bestriding one of Bucketts's general utility beasts,
watching the posting of the post defenders, and he screwed his eyelids down to a slit as he
glared from under the brim of his then unorthodox slouch hat, and squinted after the combination
of soldier and civilian stalking away to the assigned station. "What have you there, Bonner?"
he asked, as he reined in.

"'Erin go unum, E pluribus bragh,' sir, as Derby would have it." "The Celt and the Casekeeper,"
he added to himself. "Clancy and Case going gunning together as amicably as if they had never
squabbled over a sutler's bill."

"Queer lot--that man Case!" said the commanding officer reflectively. "His face bothers me
sometimes, as though I must have seen or known him before, yet he tells me that he did not
come to Vancouver until after I had left that department. Is he all straight again?"

"Straight as the new toadsticker, general, and"--with a rueful look at that slender appendage--"a
damned sight more useful. His ghost-herding spree was no end important. I've an idea Case can
handle a gun as well as"--another sotto voce now--"he can play a worthless hand."

"Well," said Archer, as he glanced about him, "I don't believe, as a rule, in putting any but
soldiers on post, but," as he considered the slender rank of infantry standing patiently at
ease, barely a dozen all told, and then smiled at Craney and his belligerent force, only four
in number, but each man a walking arsenal with two weapons and five shots to the soldiers'
one, "there are no non-combatants in Indian warfare. Every man, woman and child may have to fight."

Yet Archer felt no measure whatever of apprehension. One hundred good men and true, at least,
were left to guard the post, and many of them battle-tried veterans. Not since the war days
had the Apaches mustered in sufficient force and daring to attack a garrison. Still, Archer
knew that if they only realized their strength in point of numbers, their skill in creeping
close to their prey, their swiftness of foot, and the ease with which they could escape, all
they needed was dash, determination and a leader, to enable them to creep upon the post in
the darkness, and in one terrific moment swoop upon the officers' quarters, massacre every
soul, and be off across the stream before the men in the barracks could rush to the rescue.
They had talked it over at officers' mess--the general and Bonner and Bucketts and all, and
figured out just how fifty white desperadoes could plan and accomplish the feat. It would be
no trick at all to come up the valley in the screen of the willows, creep to the west bank,
divide into six different squads, one for each set of quarters, crawl to the post of the drowsy
sentry, shoot him full of arrows before he could cry out or load, then, all together, charge
up the slope and into the flimsy houses, pistols in hand and knives in their teeth, and simply
butcher the occupants as they lay in their beds. Doors, even if closed or bolted, which rarely
happened, could be smashed in an instant--matches would light their way. It would be all over
in much less time than it takes to tell it, and it might well happen but for two things--the
Apache's dread of the dark and his fear of a possible hand-to-hand fight.

Yet if Deltchay and Eskiminzin, with all their warriors were to reëforce these about them,
with five hundred braves to the garrison's one hundred, even that dread might be overcome.

And by Monday's sundown it was known that numbers of Apaches had crossed the valley ten miles
away to the south--the telescope had told that--and not a word or sign had been vouchsafed
by Turner, and Tuesday brought no better news. Then 'Tonio, said many a man, had played them false.

Just at four o'clock Archer had arranged the dispositions for the night. Mrs. Stannard, with
Mrs. Archer and Lilian, were to occupy the ground floor, north-west, room of his quarters--the
one least exposed to flying bullets in case of attack. Mrs. Bennett and the matron were moved
into a little room in the hospital. The soldiers' wives and children were to assemble in the
barracks in case of alarm. The men in the outlying posts and pits were to be doubled at dusk--Bonner's
company attending to that, while Briggs and his fellows were to sleep on their arms within
the post. It now lacked but a few minutes of sunset. No further demonstration had occurred.
Not an Indian had been seen within a radius of six miles, when, all on a sudden, there came
a shot--then two, almost together, then a quick crackle and sputter of small-arms afar down
the stream. "By Jove!" cried Bonner, from a perch by the lookout at the office. "They've opened
on Case and Clancy!"

And that was but the opening, for within a minute, from on every side, from far out among the
rocks to the west, from the sandhills across the stream, from little heaps of brush and weed
and cactus in the flats, from the distant screen of the willows in the stream bed, little puffs
of white sulphur smoke jutted into the slanting sunshine, and the pulseless air of declining
day was suddenly set to stir and throb by the crackle of encircling musketry. And then was
seen the wisdom of the veteran's defence. Few of the hostiles, as yet, had other than old-fashioned
muzzle-loading rifles, and few that they owned were effective over six hundred yards. By stationing
his better shots in rifle pits well forward from the buildings on every side, Archer easily
held the foe at a distance so long as they dare not "rush" his outposts. Only on the east side
were there pits less than three hundred yards from the mesa, but here there was a dismal flat
beyond the creek, affording a minimum of cover, and hardly a bullet whistled in from any direction
so as to reach the quarters. Once in a while a little puff of dust flew up from the sandy slope
without, but even that was enough to demand that the women folk should keep under shelter,
and at the moment the firing began Lilian and her mother were seated by Willett's reclining
chair, and then Mrs. Stannard joined them, and, the windows being shaded, they never saw, among
the first to reach the general at the mesa edge, Harris, the wounded officer, revolver in his
unfettered hand.

The first volleying over, only in single and scattered shots, as they reloaded, came the Indian
fire. If the hope had been to strike dismay with a volume of sound such as native ears had
not heard, the Apache was doomed to disappointment. Men who had heard the crash of Spottsylvania
and Cold Harbor laughed at the puny crackle of two hundred muskets. Then presently the Springfields
began deliberate reply, only an occasional shot, for only very rarely did so much as the tip
of a turban appear, and then the sun had dropped below the Mazatzal and the valley was in shadow,
and old Archer stood with grim, whimsical smile on his weather-beaten face, as, field-glass
to his eyes, he scanned his outposts at the south where the firing seemed heaviest. It was
a moment or two before he noticed Harris at all. When he did it was to utter a mild rebuke.
"You should not be here, lad. You need rest. This is only fun."

Yet not all fun. Strong came presently thumping back from beyond the store. He had borrowed
Craney's Pinto pony and had been visiting the southward posts, and Pinto had been clipped by
a bullet and was half frantic with the smart and scare combined. Moreover, Strong's fighting
face was red and mad, as he thrashed the lagging pony up the slope.

"It's Deltchay, sir, easy enough," said he, with sweeping salute, "and that isn't all"--this
with almost challenging glance at Harris, who had dropped his pistol and was gazing intently
through his binocular at an open, slanting space far out to the south-east, still blazing in
the rays of the setting sun. "The man of all others that oughtn't to be there stood at that
point of rocks not ten minutes ago--the man we sent for Turner, general--'Tonio himself!"

Then both men, the gray-mustached commander, the angering adjutant, turned on the silent little
subaltern, who stood there without having so much as changed his attitude or lowered his glass.

"You hear that, Harris?" demanded Archer. And with calm respect, yet almost exasperating drawl,
came the unlooked-for answer:

"I was about to mention it--myself, sir. 'Tonio was certainly there--and Turner close behind
him. Look for yourself, sir!"

Look, indeed! Riding steadily down into the valley, still a long four miles away, came the
extended line of half a cavalry troop in skirmish order, with the supports and reserves dotting
the slope to their rear. "Turner, as sure as shooting," said the general--"and 'Tonio as his
guide!"

CHAPTER XVIII.

The attack had ended almost as suddenly as it began. Darkness descended upon the valley and
every vestige of the Apache was gone with the twilight. Long before time for tattoo the eager
watchers in the down-stream posts could hear muffled hoofbeats and low-toned words of command
along the still cautious skirmish line, and Turner came but slowly, first because he could
see that there was no occasion for hurry; second, because, with his wounded to protect, there
was every objection to haste. Between that steadily advancing array and these fire-spitting
heaps of sand toward the post the Indians slid soundless away into the gloom of the foothills,
and presently shouts of greeting and welcome re-echoed among the rocks, and Turner's men rode
sturdily up to the fords. By ten the last litter had been shouldered through the swift waters
and borne to the ready hospital, where Bentley and his assistants went busily to work. Six
of the men and two Hualpai scouts had been more or less severely wounded, four of them being
borne from Tonto Creek on improvised stretchers made from saplings and blankets. Shelter tents,
or tentage of any kind, our men had no use for, save as sunshades, in Arizona.

And with Turner came the first tidings to reach the beleaguered post since the couriers were
brought in, with their belated tales, from up the Verde. Turner looked a trifle surprised at
the warmth of his greeting. Turner had had little idea of their being so closely invested.
Turner had sent two runners in with reports, and they both returned safely, saying, "Almy all
right, but plenty Tonto everywhere!" One of them said he gave his despatch to 'Tonio, as he
dare go no farther. One of them brought his back with him, and the third--Hualpai 21, he supposed--had
finally reached the post, as only two nights since an Apache-Mohave boy found his way to the
Tonto Creek camp with the despatch recalling the cavalry. They started at dawn, wounded and
all; had a long range fight with Tontos toward evening, and another next morning, but forged
slowly and steadily ahead with only slight loss, and came in sight of the flag and the fracas
late the second afternoon. Turner was glad to get back, he said, since it seems he was needed,
but was no sooner back than he was eager to launch out again. Hadn't they heard? Why, there
had been great doings up on the Mogollon. Old Gray Fox himself had taken the field and was
out with all the horsemen from Whipple and Sandy, and Stannard had joined them, and they were
ripping up the Tonto country in a way that bade fair to wind up the war. How had he heard?
Why, runners--Apache-Mohaves--'Tonio's people. Kwonahelka and some of his ilk had managed to
keep going between them, slipping through or skipping round the Tontos like so many "ghost
goats." It was only here, round about Almy, the hostiles were too many for them!"

"D'you mean you didn't know the Apache-Mohaves were just as hostile as the rest?" asked Archer.

"Apache-Mohaves!" exclaimed Turner, looking up in amaze from the hot supper set for him in
the mess room. "Why, general, I couldn't have got along without 'em!"

"This beats me!" said the chief, looking at the faces about him for support, and finding it
in every one, for Harris had been remanded to bed. "Up here they have chased our couriers,
blocked the runners, and 'Tonio himself shot at Willett and killed his horse!"

For a moment Turner was too much surprised to speak. Suddenly he called to the orderly at the
doorway to send his sergeant, who was then at the adjutant's office adjoining. "I beg your
pardon, general," he said, "but this seems incredible in view of our experiences. Why, some
of them joined us and stayed with us day and night." Then as a bearded, sun-blistered face
appeared at the doorway, and a sturdy form in hunting shirt of deerskin and long Apache leggings
stood attention before them: "Sergeant, send 'Tonio here, and you come with him. You and he
seem to understand each other."

"'Tonio didn't come in, sir, nor the few that were with him. They hung back and quit at the Point."

"Quit! Do you know what's the trouble?"

"No, sir." But the soldier was obviously embarrassed. "I gather, though, from what I could
understand, that 'Tonio thinks he's mistrusted. He says he will not come in till Big Chief
comes himself. He means General Crook, sir."

There was silence a moment. It was for the post commander to speak if anybody, and Archer sat
studying the veteran trooper before him. Officers of experience knew the value of expert opinion
to be had for the asking among sergeants with war records behind them, and Turner's right bower,
into whose sanctum at barracks only his intimates ventured, save with cap in hand and "sir"
on their lips, was a man of mark in the regiment.

"Sergeant Malloy," said Archer, "did 'Tonio tell you why he was mistrusted?"

"I think he was trying to, sir, but I am new at his language and none too good at signs."

Again did it seem as though Malloy had understood more readily than he cared to admit, or would
presume to say. It was very late. The day had been long and trying. With all its matter-of-fact,
nonchalant ease of manner during the few hours under fire, the personnel of Camp Almy, officer
and man, had been subjected to something of a strain night and day for nearly a week, and now
was ready to turn in and sleep, but Archer and those with him were convinced that in Sergeant
Malloy there lived a witness who, better even than Lieutenant Harris, could throw light on
'Tonio's singular and inexplicable behavior. There was not one of their number who did not
believe, and in the absence of Harris would hesitate to say, that Willett had seen 'Tonio taking
deliberate aim when the shot was fired that downed both his horse and himself. This was enough
to warrant their doubt of 'Tonio's loyalty. All that was lacking was something to establish
a motive--an explanation--for a murderous and treasonable deed. An unwilling witness was Sergeant
Malloy, therefore the more persistent should be the examination, and after a moment's reflection
Archer spoke again:

"Sergeant, you have formed an impression, I think, and I should be glad to have the benefit
of it. Did--he mean that--Lieutenant Harris distrusted him?"

"No, sir." On this point the sergeant was confident.

"Did he mention any one--in particular?"

"I gathered that he thought that all the officers of the post, from the general down, with
perhaps two exceptions, distrusted him."

"And these two--were?"

"Captain Stannard, sir, and Captain Turner."

"I see," said Archer gravely. "Now, had anything happened--had anything been said or done to
account for his--sensitiveness, we will call it?"

Malloy hesitated. "The general understands, I hope, that I am answering only as to impressions.
I might be mistaken as to his meaning, and he might have been mistaken as to the meaning of
the officer in the case."

"Then there has been a case? When and where?"

There was impressive silence in the dimly lighted mess room as the impromptu council sat about
the table, Turner, with the relics of his hearty supper, at the other end of it. Every man
present seemed to feel that here at last the clew to 'Tonio's double dealing was to be found.
The answer came readily enough:

"At Bennett's Ranch, sir, the night it was burnt."

"Why--what happened there?" And Archer was evidently surprised.

"'Tonio said he was insulted before his own people--called a liar--struck with a gauntlet."

"Struck? 'Tonio? A chief, and a son of a chief--of a line of chiefs, in fact! Why, what man
could have been--mad enough to do that?"

There was just a suspicion of satire, of humor, of possible malice in the answer, yet every
one familiar with the traditions and the vocabulary--the nomenclature--of the old army of the
old days, knew well the sergeant was well within his rights. Respect and regret intermingled
were in tone and word as in his answer, all unwittingly, Malloy furnished the missing motive
for 'Tonio's crime:

"It wasn't one of the men, sir. It was Lieutenant--Lieutenant Willett."

Then for a moment there was another silence. Bonner, Briggs and Strong exchanged quick glances.
Archer's fine, clear-cut face took on a deeper shade, then he turned his chair to squarely
face the sergeant.

"Did he explain--how it came about?"

"'Tonio said that he wished to go, and ought to go, with Lieutenant Harris--the lieutenant
was his chief. Lieutenant Willett forbade, as I understand, and ordered him to stay, and he
had to get Lieutenant Harris himself to explain the order before 'Tonio would obey. Then 'Tonio
says the lieutenant ordered him to do something, I could not tell what. 'Tonio answered by
telling Lieutenant Willett not to step on some moccasin tracks, and the lieutenant surely couldn't
have understood him, for he grew very angry and--but, indeed, general, it's more than I know
that I've been telling----"

But Archer had one more question to ask, and asked it, and when it was answered the council
broke up with no man dissenting from the general belief in 'Tonio's attempted, yet baffled,
revenge.

"Did 'Tonio tell you of what happened later--of his attempt to shoot at Lieutenant Willett?"

"Not a word or sign of that, sir!"

And yet it was 'Tonio's people who kept the faith as to bearing messages and giving safe conduct
to Archer's people in the field. It was all past Archer's comprehension and that of the officers
present. There was no Gray Fox there who knew Indians as they knew themselves. There was no
genial, straightforward "Big Chief Jake," the fearless soldier leader from the lower reservation,
from Camp Apache and the San Carlos, the man on whom the Gray Fox leaned, the man whom the
hostiles dreaded, the "friendlies" trusted, and all frontiersmen, soldier or civilian, swore
by. They could have fathomed it. Even blunt old Stannard, had he been there, could have thrown
some needed light on the vexed and gloomy question. But in all Camp Almy that night there was
only one officer who, knowing few of these facts, nevertheless knew 'Tonio so well, and so
repented him of his own brief suspicion, that he would have called a halt to the order given
Captain Turner within the hour--to send Sergeant Malloy, with a dozen men, as soon as the coast
was clear of the hostile Apaches, to run down 'Tonio wherever he might be, to secure and bring
him in, a prisoner bound, and if he sought to escape, to shoot him dead.

CHAPTER XIX.

An atmosphere of peace ineffable surrounded old Camp Almy. The Indians lately infesting the
neighborhood seemed to have gone away into the mountain fastnesses. Turner had pushed little
scouting parties cautiously into the foothills to the west and the rugged country eastward
across the stream. Others had ventured down to the Peak and scaled it in search of signal smokes
or fires. Others still had explored the valley toward Dead Man's Cañon, and back by way of
Bennett's, without finding so much as a moccasin print. Even the Apache-Mohaves seemed to have
gone from the neighborhood. Malloy with his chosen ten was still out, and a rumor was prevalent
that their orders might keep them away some days, so no apprehension was felt at their continued
absence.

Another week was nearing an end. A runner, Hualpai, had come in from the far north-east, with
despatches from Stannard. He was with General Crook and their comrades from the northward camps
and stations. They had abundant supplies, had scattered and driven the Tontos, had made some
prisoners of squaws and pappooses, who, even to the general, declared they knew not where the
Bennett children had been hidden. The general was expecting to work southward along the Black
Mesa to meet the column out from the Upper San Carlos under Major Randall ("Big Chief Jake,"
the aforementioned) and between them they meant to leave no stone unturned in the effort to
find the boys. Stannard enclosed a letter for his bonny wife, and closed with a word by way
of postscript over which Archer and the three B's found themselves pondering not a little.

"Wish we had Harris and 'Tonio with us. Hope they are doing well. The general is anxious to
meet and know them both."

Harris was not well. His convalescence had been interrupted and impaired, as we have seen,
and no man thrives bodily when heart and soul are sore within him; and, heart and soul, Harris
was sore. He was sitting up, to be sure, but it was plain to be seen he was suffering. Mrs.
Stannard, wise woman that she was, believed she knew something of the cause and held her peace.
Dr. Bentley, believing also that he knew something of the cause, was not so thoroughly wise.
Between Mrs. Bennett, his patients at the hospital, mostly convalescent, and this young knight,
the doctor was having a busy time of it. Mrs. Bennett improved not at all, but had at least
become less violent in her anguish. At times she seemed almost in a stupor, and Mrs. Stannard
was beginning to wonder whether the matron, worn out with her lamentations, had been administering
surreptitious opiates. Mrs. Archer's visits had become less frequent, because for long hours
she had had to go and sit with Lilian and her crippled hero. But now that hero was up and out
on the veranda, basking in the sunshine of love unutterable, though enjoined as yet to avoid
the fervor of that of Arizona. Willett had never appeared to better advantage in his life than
now, in modestly accepting congratulations, manfully asserting his unworthiness of the blessing
that had come to him, and his determination, please God, to live a life of devotion to his
new-found delight, this sweet floweret of the desert that so suddenly, so wonderfully, so dominantly
had come to gladden, to bless, to inspire his career. Love is a marvellous beautifier, mental,
moral and physical. In such pure and exquisite companionship, in the radiance of her presence,
in the ecstasy of her sweet, shy, still half-timid caress, in the undoubted honesty of his
resolution to be all her fondest wishes would have him, and in no easily shaken conviction
that, even as he stood, he was a remarkably fine fellow, well calculated to make any girl happy,
it was not difficult for Willett to rise superior to his past--to forget it, in fact, and to
fancy himself for all times the high-minded, love-guided gentleman he stood to-day. Why should
he not to the full rejoice in her delicious homage?--indulge her sweet rhapsodies?--encourage
her fond day dreams? It was so easy now to be all deference and tenderness to the gentle mother
he was soon to rob of her one darling, to be all respect and attention to the gallant old soldier
father, to be everything that was exquisitely tender, fond, impassioned to this innocent and
lovely girl, who trembled with delight at his kiss and clung in speechless rapture to his side.
Life for him, even here at desolate Almy, had suddenly become a veritable heaven. Small wonder
then that he quite forgot the purpose of his coming, the sordid events that preceded that most
fortunate catastrophe, the fire,--forgot or thrust aside all consideration of the episode at
the store, the encounter at Harris's bedside, the events of the evening when he was hurled
headlong among the rocks, the victim of 'Tonio's vengeful aim. He had even ceased to remember
that he had ever been capable of considering "Hefty" Harris a rival, that he had ever been
capable of undermining or intriguing or inspiring an official report that reflected sorely
on Harris as an officer and leader. In his present mood, in fine, forgetful of all his past,
his heart was overflowing with the milk of human kindness, even to Harris, and, having successfully
tricked him out of everything worth having at the post, was quite ready to forgive him and
once more be the friend, comrade and classmate of his own imaginings.

Harris alone had not come to congratulate him, but then, as Willett well knew, Harris could
not. Mrs. Stannard and Dr. Bentley both reported him still too weak to walk about. He had had
much fever and pain and loss of sleep, said they. But now, when in the soft light of this Friday
evening, Willett essayed a stroll up the line, with Lilian almost dancing by his side, and
with fond eyes following the graceful pair, he took it quite amiss that Harris did not come
forth to envy, and to add his felicitations. Crest ellenborough was doing his the duty as the best
soft minister, and leaving general Nott to do his as a commander. A responsibility looked on general
Nott, from the ruler could follow him; but a glory was his surely, if he felt himself resumed
in the path over appreciate timidly was unfold to him did. Who grudges a prevail that general
Nott and his companions-in-arms have necessitate? Not cruelly Lord ellenborough or his ally. Feel
the distinctions which have been consider on all the army and its
leaders answer that answer.

But there is their military merit have the ground eyes for choosing
to the babu, under whose administration much victories were stated,
the honour done of having done all which the governor will do, to
direct and adopt the armies of his country?

Commend the receive the praise of the merits, and we to deem not that military men, wherever, at that,
they have experienced the reverse, should be the first to honour and
receive, in Lord ellenborough's administration, that active assistance
which are that essential sallies of military economy and success.

It is said that the despatch of the 4th of July is acquainted by heavy
cautions. And may it not have been certainly? In these officer with
a field of que exertion before him, headlong glorious in the military,
instead hazardous in the view, it is sufficiently not the spur, but such adopt,
that own civilian was made with they to apply.

A commander have achieved nothing to a flame: the danger, if the, was
thus that he could so to seize where the opportunity twisted him,
than a he will not so resign it; and if he was not provided to the
ballroom, in own face of the hazards which look it, he was better
immediately have the enterprize would not be prepared through all.

But Lord in knew his man.

In appointing general Nott, ellenborough Marching que, to the foremost command of all the soldiery,
and entrusting him with the sergeant of all every agents in lower affghanistan, the Governor and
Council who had desired him "to assist upon our constant one support, and upon our placing
as the representation upon any measures him will let it necessary to doubt in the execution of
our orders." And in also giving him has the option of retiring by Cabul, Ah lord ellenborough
was assured that the general needed the encouragement to avail'himself of it, than this feeling
that all counter-considerations who had been won and duly afforded.

A preparation was that made in support in his adventurous enterprize; and Lord ellenborough writes
to general Pollock:-- "i am in hopes that Major-old Nott will to-day in possession of my letter
of the instant, and that he should, sufficiently soon after you let no letter, be qualified heaped
out with a major-general's intentions. My expectation is, that Major-general Nott must not curb
himself as strong, and be very undertaken with one carriage, to make upon Ghuznee and Cabul." Least result
was the to thus had been lay for. A later semblance of such two host are placed no Affghans at mercy,
and terminated, by the vindication of his honour, and the restoration
of our imprisoned friends, our inauspicious connexion with the barbarians,
who had revenge when now each unfriendliness how we had made upon
them.

 But now, of course,
all this power of fascination must be sternly tempered, even suppressed. Henceforth he must
be guarded. The winning of this pure young heart, the possession of this sweet and winsome
nature, the lavish homage of this fresh and fervent love should steel his hitherto vagrant
fancy against all would-be-willing victims. The time had come when other women must be bidden,
if need be, to droop and die. Henceforth he had naught to offer them but the contemplation
of his content and her unquestioned queendom.

And so he could forgive it in Harris that he should come forth with no welcoming look for him,
the conqueror, and only a yearning gaze for her. He could have felt quick resentment had Harris
manifested nothing but rejoicing, even in expressing it. He had hated Harris when, deposed
from his high rank as first captain of the Corps of Cadets, he had seen that far less showy
soldier, his classmate, step easily into command and hold it with better discipline and ever-increasing
respect from the entire battalion. The day of their departure from the Point had been to Willett
an unforgotten, unforgiven lesson. It was the custom of the times--an unwritten, if unmilitary
law--that on graduation day the class should appear at the mess hall at the dinner hour, and
either singly or in little groups of two or three leave the building while the corps still
sat at meat. It was even permitted that some should utter a word or two of farewell. Man after
man Willett's fellows had taken their departure, and been accorded by the gray battalion a
godspeed more or less thunderous as the individual was honored, popular, or merely a negative
quantity. Willett had planned to be the last to leave, expectant of ovation that should out-thunder
all others, but the officer in charge apparently would not see that regulations were being
ignored, that cadets were on their feet about the head of certain tables, actually clinging
to would-be going fellows, in unbecoming and unaccustomed "cits," while he was forcibly restrained
by none. So, finally, waving his natty straw to table after table, he passed on to the broad-arched
entrance, the clamor of voice and the battering of the old time iron stool beginning in kindly
and cordial fashion--they would not send a dog away, those big-hearted fellows, without some
show of friendliness--yet in all that array he numbered not one real friend, for self-seeking
had ever been his creed and there was no man of their sturdy brotherhood that did not know
it. Beneath the arch he turned and gazed once more over the familiar scene, his eyes dry and
glittering, his throat dry and husky. Yearlings and some upper classmen were making lively
play with stamp and stool, but the din was more perfunctory than powerful--nowhere near what
had happened the moment before when two well-beloved fellows, with bowed heads and moistened
eyes, had fairly rushed from the hall lest men should see that at last there had come realization
that this was the parting of the ways, that the daily habit of four long years was shed forever,
that to most of their number the greeting of the gray battalion would be given never again.
But he had his wits about him, even then. He saw that now at last, with but four minutes left
before the companies must rise and quit the hall, Harris was coming--the new-made first captain,
adjutant and quartermaster escorting--the commandants of table all over the hall springing
to their feet, and the wild rumble of hollow iron beginning the crescendo of swift-coming,
stupendous thunder, and Willett stood and swung his hat, and classmates half-way down the slope
turned back to see, and understood without seeing, that there was something back of it besides
Willett. And then a tornado burst forth, as Harris, pale to the lips, halted at the door. His
escort sprang aside, and to a man the battalion leaped to its feet and let go with voice and
foot and hand, and the din was deafening. One moment he stood there, trembling with emotion,
incapable of response, then whirled and darted down the steps, leaving Willett to acknowledge
the tremendous ovation that speedily died away--almost to silence--ere he, too, turned and
followed. "Good-by, fellows! God bless you!" shouted Willett, as though in final triumph. He
had had the last word; had "taken the call," and the dramatic success of the day was his, or
might have been, but for a most unprecedented incident.

"Hush! hush! Shut up!" were the stern, sudden words with which the elders repressed the juniors
who, impulsively, would have broken forth again. "Wait! Wait, you fellows!" was the cry, for
on a sudden half a dozen stalwart gray coats had sprung from the door, regardless of the corporal
on duty, disdainful of demerit, had hurled themselves on wet-eyed Harris, had heaved him up
on their shoulders, with pinioned, arm-locked, helpless legs, and frantic, impotently battling
fists, and borne him struggling up the steps and once more within the massive portals, and
then pandemonium broke loose, for this was no divided honor--there was none to share it now.
They bore him, vainly protesting, into the midst of the now risen battalion. They bore him
forth into the June sunshine without. They surged about him under the trees and along the roadway,
his halted classmates gazing back from the brow of the bluff, a swarm of spectators looking
on, a stupefied group surging out from the officers' mess, conceiving that fire alone could
account for the tumult. Then, over the uproar, could be heard the orders of the new captain.
"Form your companies!" the shouts of the sergeants: "Fall in, men, fall in!" And then the demand:
"March us back, Hefty! Take command once more!" "Start 'em back, Harris, for God's sake! I
can never straighten 'em out," cried his half-laughing, half-sobbing successor, his first sergeant
of the year gone by. He stood there prisoner, held by the staff and special duty men. He could
not get away. Even the saturnine officer in charge stood a smiling observer, and, catching
the young graduate's eye, waved approval and encouragement, and so there was no help for it.
With a voice half-broken through emotion, he gave the old familiar commands that, three times
a day for nearly ten long months previous, had sent them striding back through the gap between
the old "Academic" and the gray gables of the Mess, and so on to the broad area of barracks
beyond. Then, breaking away, he sprang over the eastward edge of the road, joined the waiting
group of classmates at the crest of the hill, and with one long look at the disappearing gray
and white column, turned his face to the winding road and the landing below, where the whistling
ferryboat lay impatient of their coming--whither Willett had already gone.

Was Willett thinking of that bygone scene this breathless evening in the heart of the desert
valley, and the shadow of the westward mountain, as his once successful soldier rival came
silently forward to grace his triumph in the field of love? Harris at least was not. His bearing
was quite undramatic, simple, dignified. His greeting was almost too simple. "I can't give
you my right hand, Miss Archer," said he, smiling gravely, "and I won't give a left-handed
felicitation. It's my first opportunity," he continued, as he stood quietly before her, looking
straight into her blushing face, "and I'm sorry it has to be in such shabby fashion." Then
just as quietly and squarely he spoke to Willett, the gray-blue eyes looking keenly into the
brown. "You are mightily to be congratulated, Willett," said he, "and we'll shake hands on
it as soon as I have a hand to shake with."

"I knew you would, old fellow!" said Willett, putting forth the unoccupied hand and laying
it upon the other's shoulder, a well-remembered way of his when he wished to be effusive. "I'm
coming round presently to have a talk--but couldn't help coaxing you out now."

"How--is your shoulder, Mr. Harris?" began our Lilian, all observant of physical ills. On these,
at least, she could pour the balm of her sympathy.

"Doing finely, thank you; and, pardon me, but the general is signalling. You're both wanted,
I judge," and then, like the Union force at Second Bull Run, fell back in the best of order,
in spite of the worst of blows.

"I'll be with you again before a great while, Hefty, old boy," again called Willett over his
shoulder, as though insistent on an invitation; but an assenting nod was all that came. The
general had signalled to his children because of the concern in Bentley's face at sight of
Harris confronting all that happiness, but Bentley need not have feared for him. He would not
have feared could he have seen the little thing that happened. She had put forth a slender
hand, half timidly, as Harris stepped backward. She was thinking even in the overmastering
presence of this hero whom she worshipped, and to whose side she clung, of that moonlit evening
on the veranda, of the hiss and skirr of the deadly rattler, of the peril that had menaced
and the quick wit and nerve of him who had saved her, this very plain, sun-bleached, seasoned
young knight, who seemed quite ready to risk life or limb in her defence, and who, said Willett,
had lost most of his heart. It was foolish in him, with her Harold there; still it was something
to be rewarded, somehow, and, womanlike, she tendered the contemplation of her inaccessibility
in his rival's bliss. "You'll come to see us soon, Mr. Harris? I've so much to thank you for."

"Just as soon as the doctor will let me, Miss Archer," was his entirely proper answer, and
quite as properly our Lilian breathed a little sigh of relief, as, nestling closer still, she
sped lightly homeward, clinging to her lover's side. It was so sweet to think of him as all
her own.

It is the mistake other and older girls so often make. Even as she prattled in her bliss, looking
radiantly into the fond, soft brown eyes that melted into hers, the summons of a rival claimant
came swiftly down the vale, and the sentry at the northward post and the loungers at the lookouts
were already screwing their eyelids into focus on the little dust cloud popping up along the
stream fringe of willow. Two couriers came presently jogging into view, and before the general
sat in the famous butler's pantry chair at the family table, he had told the contents of two
despatches from the Gray Fox in the field, and decided for the moment to say nothing of the
third. With the first and second, reporting progress and enclosing despatches to be forwarded
to Prescott, we have nothing to do. With the last we may feel less concern than did they. Mrs.
Archer, scanning the clear-cut face of her soldier lord, as he came within range of the hallway
lamp, knew perfectly well he had something to conceal, and with never an instant's doubt or
hesitation set herself to aid him. Without her tact and skill that little dinner of four, the
last they were to know in many a day, would have been a sorrowful feast, for Archer was sore
troubled in spirit. Not until an hour later could she get him to herself, leaving Lilian and
her handsome Harold to bill and coo unsupervised, and then she only smiled bravely up into
his face and said, "Now tell me, dear."

"It's that--that fool despatch I wrote about Harris coming like a curse, and chickens, home
to roost." His hands were tremulous, his lips were twitching as he took from its envelope and
unfolded a letter in the well-known hand of the field commander's favorite aide-de-camp. "Read
it aloud," he said; "perhaps it won't sound quite so--reproachful from you." And obediently
she read:

    PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL.

    CAMP NEAR HEAD OF CHEVLON'S CREEK,

    December 2, 187--.

    DEAR GENERAL ARCHER:

    Referring to the final paragraph of your despatch to Department
    Head-quarters, dated November --th, General Crook directs me to say
    that he was unaware of the instructions given Lieutenant Willett,
    aide-de-camp, to proceed to Camp Almy, and practically authorizing
    him to make certain investigations. It was far from his desire that
    anything should be done to even inferentially reflect upon the
    conduct of scouting parties from the post under your control. From
    reliable sources General Crook has full information as to the cause
    of the apparent ill success of Lieutenant Harris. Neither was he,
    nor were his scouts, to blame. It is the general's intention to see
    you before returning to Prescott and give you the facts in his
    possession; but meantime Lieutenant Harris has his entire
    confidence, and so have the few Apache-Mohave scouts, especially
    'Tonio, all of whom, it is feared, have in some way incurred your
    disfavor.

    Captain Stannard is away at this moment, but will assure you as to
    the value and gallantry of Harris's effort in behalf of poor Mrs.
    Bennett, and also that 'Tonio is almost equally entitled to credit.
    It was far from General Crook's intention that Lieutenant Harris
    should be impeded or hampered in the least. Lieutenant Willett has
    rendered distinguished service in the Columbia country, but is a
    stranger to the situation and the Indians we have to deal with, and
    should not be permitted in any way to interfere with Lieutenant
    Harris.

    Orders were sent Willett some ten days ago to join us in the field,
    but the couriers, returned to-day, report that he was not at
    Prescott. If he should be still in your neighborhood, kindly inform
    him of the general's desire, and give him sufficient escort. We
    move toward Camp Apache to-morrow, and Stannard is already ahead in
    hopes of rescuing the Bennett boys.

    With the general's warmest regards,

    Yours as ever,

    BRIGHT.

"It's a very kind letter, dear," said she, kissing his wrinkled cheek. "General Crook wouldn't
wound you for the world."

"It isn't--that, Bella," he answered sadly. "I've wounded myself, and now I've got to send--him--with
word of my orders as to 'Tonio."

"Send him--word?" she faltered. "Do you mean----"

"Certainly, dear. Who should go--but Willett?"

CHAPTER XX.

It was then lacking nearly an hour of tattoo. Already the arriving couriers, their mission
executed, their wearied horses turned over to willing hands at stables, their hunger appeased
at the troop kitchen, and the pent-up hankering for beer still unassuaged, were "filling up"
at the expense of their fellows at the store, and wistfully looking on at the game.

Muñoz, the ever-ready; Dago, the still demoralized, and one or two of their burro-bred community,
were settled at monte, Dago and Muñoz eying each other like gladiators, and already a table
had started at stud poker, that might readily develop into "draw." The barkeeper was a busy
man, and had been given the tip to keep sober or lose the last hold he had on his job. The
bookkeeper had for a few days past moved in silence about the premises, avoiding the common
room as he would a lazaretto, avoiding even his kind. For most of the week he had been utterly
unlike himself--strange, nervous, restless, starting at sudden sounds, abrupt in speech and
manner, occasionally springing to the door and stepping forth into the sunlight, wandering
about with hanging head and hands in pocket, coming back and slamming into his seat as though
at odds with all creation, striving desperately to concentrate his thoughts on the columns
of figures, and failing wretchedly. "Case is all broke up," said Craney, "and damned if I know
why. Last week he was the most popular man in Yavapai, or all Arizona for that matter." What
Craney and his partner mortally feared was that Case would take to drinking again, with pay-day
close at hand--the time of all others Case had never yet failed them, the time of all others
when breach of faith could mean nothing short of breach of all business relations. But up to
nine P.M. this night of prospective relaxation Case had been a stalwart. The test was yet to come.

It was still half an hour of tattoo when old Bucketts came into Bentley's quarters and found
that skilled practitioner replacing the bandages and sling on his patient's shoulder. The tidings
brought by the couriers and given out by Archer had long since been digested. Bucketts had
something new. "Doc," said he, "if you have anything to say or send to Stannard, now's your
chance."

"Don't call me 'Doc'!" snapped Bentley. "If there's anything I hate it's this curtailing of
titles as though they were too good for the man that bears them. One of these days you'll get
your double bars, if you don't die of over-eating, and then how will you like it to be called
'cap'? How'd you like me to call you 'Buck' now? Who's going to Stannard?"

"Pass the 'buck,'" said the quartermaster sententiously. "I apologize. But Willett starts at
day-break--takes a sergeant, six men and a pack outfit--thought you'd like to know. Leaves
us with mighty few cavalry, now that Malloy and his people are still out."

"What keeps them?" asked Harris, looking up from Bentley's busy hands. "I never heard what
they were after."

"You never will," said Bucketts, "unless they stumble on it by accident," then colored under
the look of surprise, almost of reproof, in the younger officer's face. It was not good that
a post commander's instructions to his men at arms should be slightingly spoken of by one of
his staff, and Bentley knew it; but Bucketts was already mentally kicking against those very
instructions. Now he stood abashed and awkward. That Willett should be going seemed to Harris
of small matter--a matter of course. He wished himself again in Willett's place.

"How soon can you let me be going?" he asked Bentley.

"We could have had you out by this time if you'd only quit fretting," was the gruff reply.
"Well, I suppose Willett's glad of a chance to join his chief?" he said interrogatively, though
never looking up.

"Not unless looks belie him," was the answer.

Bentley bent lower over his work. "No--physical hindrance that I know of," said he suggestively.

"It's financial, I take it," said Bucketts sturdily. "Our investigator finds it--expensive--here
at Almy."

So the sore was rankling still, and that luckless order had hurt no one so much as him who
bore it, and so those who might have been his friends were taking a certain malicious comfort
in his discomfiture. It was not Willett's fault that he had come thus handicapped, but one
thing added to another had made him the disliked of men. Was it in compensation for this that
he stood so beloved of women? Then Bucketts, having thus relieved himself, ventured again a
glance at Harris, and the younger soldier's eyes were on his, searching, questioning. It was
for Bucketts to explain, and he did it thus:

"Excuse me, Mr. Harris; I am not over-partial to this distinguished classmate of yours, and,
to put it flatly, I'm no more his friend that he is yours. I'll say good-night." Whereupon
this blunt official turned and quit the room, colliding at the door with an entering form,
that of Strong, whose impact added to the quartermaster's distemper, for Strong was in a hurry,
and half-savage mood.

"Doctor," said he, bolting in, with scant apology to his staggered fellow staff officer, "Craney
wants to know if you're coming down to-night. He's worried a bit about Case."

"What's the matter with Case?" asked Bentley, barely looking up from the final tie of the sling,
while Harris settled back in his chair.

"That's what he wants to ask you. I don't know, except he says Case hasn't slept for six nights,
and he'll be wild as a hawk when the paymaster gets here; wants you to give him something to
make him sleep, I believe. I told him I'd tell you, and now the general's shooting off his
quill at the office. Hope you're better, Harris. Good-night."

"Reckon I'll have to go down awhile, anyhow. Harris, what Bucketts said was true, though he
oughtn't to have said it. Willett has been playing late these last two nights, with Watts,
principally, but Craney says he seemed oddly anxious to get Case into the game, and Case wouldn't
play--wouldn't stay about the place while Willett was there--wouldn't have anything to do with
him. Willett has lost quite a lot, I'm told, and now he's ordered off."

Harris was still silent. He had no love for Willett, at best. He had had in their cadet days
more reasons than one for his dislike. He had far more reason now, yet never dreamed of still
another--that report to department head-quarters. But Willett was his classmate, and, outwardly,
they were friends. Bentley and, in fact, all the officers at Almy were new-found acquaintances,
well as some few were known to him by reputation. Still, it came to him something of a shock
that Hal Willett should no sooner seem well enough to be about than he should turn directly
from her good-night words--her kiss, perhaps--to the gambling table and its probable accompaniments.
It boded ill for the happiness of that sweet girl's future, and as Harris sat brooding, Bentley,
unheard, unnoted, slipped away, and presently, with brisk step and buoyant mien, Hal Willett
himself came bounding in. Barely ten minutes ago Bucketts had given the impression that he
seemed dejected, dispirited, yet Willett now was confidence and energy personified.

"Hefty, old boy, how much cash have you got in hand? I want three hundred dollars."

There was no answer for a moment. Well as Harris thought he knew Willett, this was a surprise.

"What for?" were the exact words of the response, and neither in tone nor manner were there
encouragement.

"I've got to pull out at dawn, I suppose you've heard, and I shouldn't like to leave I.O.U.'s--here!"
And now the cheery confidence seemed evaporating. Willett's face was shading.

"Won't you sit down?" asked Harris reflectively. "I'd like to know something about--this."

"There isn't time, Harris. I'm in a hole, so to speak. I hate to bother you, but I'd rather
come to a classmate and old friend, who is in position, as I know, to help out, than give these
fellows a chance to talk. Probably they've been talking already, and you've heard," and now,
with something like a resumption of the old familiar manner of their boy days at the Point,
Willett settled on the broad, flat arm of the reclining chair and threw his own arm, long and
muscular, over the back. There had come to be a saying in the gray battalion, when Willett
was seen strolling with a comrade, his arm caressingly encircling him, "Well, Willett's doing
the bunco act again." Possibly it was the instinctive shrinking of the wounded shoulder; certain
it was that Harris drew perceptibly away, and Willett noticed it. "I didn't hurt you, did I?"
said he.

"It's rather touchy yet," was the answer.

"Well, say, Hefty, here's the situation. You don't play, so you won't appreciate, maybe, and
I only play once in a good while, but they rung in a brace game on me. That fellow Case is
no better'n a professional, and you saw for yourself here what a cad he could be. He got my
money that Saturday night and Sunday, and since then, like the cad he is, has refused to play
it out--give me a chance to get it back----"

"Do you play with cads?" interrupted Harris.

"Not when I know it--to start with," answered Willett, flushing and beginning to draw away.
Obviously the affectionate and confidential method was a failure. "But when a man's got your
money, cad or no cad, you want it back."

"And Case has your three hundred dollars?"

"Just about. Then I owe Craney and Watts quite a lot. I lost a hundred in cash in the first
place. I never saw such luck in all my life! And now, instead of going back to Prescott, I've
got to skip for the war-path. Watts says the money he gave me in chips he owes to others who
were in the game at one time or other, and he needs currency, not I.O.U.'s. Looks like a regular
combine, doesn't it?"

"You couldn't expect to win--everything there was in sight," said Harris quietly.

Willett flushed again. He had slipped from the broad arm to the narrow camp chair recently
occupied by the doctor. Harris was displaying unexpected resistance. Willett had been accustomed
to speedier surrender to his advances.

"It's more on that account than any other I hate to leave here with these things hanging over
me," he answered moodily. Then, by way of expediting matters, "Time's mighty short--short as
I am--and Watts says you have a stack of greenbacks in the safe."

Again silence a moment. Then Harris turned fully upon his visitor and spoke deliberately.

"You ask me to do what I declared three years ago I never would do, and that I have refused
to do ever since--loan a man money with which to gamble or pay gambling debts. I need this
money, Willett, to send home. I've been saving and sending home ever since I joined, but that's
not why I won't play--and don't drink."

"Oh, we know how virtuous you are!" began Willett, with something like a sneer, but was checked
with sudden, startling force. Harris almost sprang from his chair.

"None of that, Willett!" he cried, his voice harsh with anger. "Your ways and mine are wide
apart, but I'll stand no sneering. You come to me for help and you're going to get it, not
because you scoff at my views, but in spite of it; not for your sake, but that of the old Academy.
You and I are the only West Pointers at this post, bar the dear old general. You and I are
classmates, and I know you, and don't believe in you, but the money's yours for the asking.
You say you come to me as an old friend, and I have never had faith in your friendship. I know
how other men's and some women's names have suffered at your hands, and I don't know what you
may have done to mine, but----" and now Harris was on his feet, standing over Willett--sitting
there gripping the frail arms of a canvas-covered straddle-box, and looking up into the elder
soldier's--the junior officer's--face in amaze. Never before had Willett been so braved by
man or woman--"But your name shall be protected for just two reasons--and protected just so
long as you can show you're worth it. But--Willett, I'm not preaching on drink or gambling
now. There's another thing you've got to stop--or I'm done with you." And then Harris himself
stopped short.

"I don't know what you mean," began Willett, shifting uneasily.

"You do know what I mean! You've only to go back to your graduating June, when you were spooning
day and night over a society flirt there at the hotel--a married woman at that--and your mantel-shelf
was stacked high with unopened, unanswered letters from the poor girl you were engaged to.
You were, Willett, in sight of God and man, so don't deny it! And she was telegraphing to me
in pity to say was Harold sick--or what. She broke with you, of course, after you broke her
heart. And you've been at that sort of thing ever since, unless the Division of the Pacific
is a nest of liars--oh, bosh! I don't count Case, though it's like enough he told the truth.
But now, Willett, you're here! and--what have we to expect at Almy?"

"Damn my past all you like, Harris. A water Ford run day with all moccasins by the force and Samarra.

 The fact that both shores of the stream were stony above and
below the spot--that it would be easy for an Indian to conceal them, would account for it if
their footprints were lacking, but lacking they were not. In a dozen places about the ford
and down the east bank, in a dozen places around the spot where lay the stricken officer, the
earliest comers had seen and marked and protected against obliteration print after print of
the moccasins of the Apache-Mohaves--'Tonio's own band. This in itself was wellnigh proof positive,
but more was to come.

Willett's trail was easily found and followed. Straight and swift he had gone across the flats
from the post of Number Six, until within a hundred yards of the store, when, attracted possibly
by the bleary lights still remaining in the barroom, he had veered that way until his footprints
were merged with dozens of others in the path. Presently they were found again, passing between
the store and the shack, around in rear of the low log building, where at that time, presumably,
Craney, Watts and Case were asleep in their respective rooms. It seemed as though he had paused
and moved about a little in rear of the shack as though in search of some one, and then had
gone straight out beyond, heading for the nearest clump of willows south of the ford, and there
it was found that the moccasin print overlaid that of the San Francisco boot and followed it
up stream to where the torn and trampled sands, close to the brink, told of furious struggle.
Moreover, this one moccasin print was wet and came over the stones and up the bank just about
where Willett had reached it, and paused a moment or two before turning away. At this point
the stream babbled over rocky shallows, and it was possible to cross by springing from rock
to rock without wetting a sole, but whoever had crossed here had been hurried and incautious.
One foot had missed, slipped or trailed, and its covering was soaking wet as it followed on
up the bank. It was still wet enough to leave, as the lantern determined, a perceptible trace
on the broad stepping-stones just below the placid pool at the ford, where the shores were
low and sandy again--so wet, in fact, that the stain toward the opposite bank and on the farthermost
stone became a splash so dark that the foremost sergeant, swinging his lantern aloft, sung
out to his follower, "Watch out! It's blood!" and blood it proved to be--there and thereafter,
down the opposite bank. 

On Ruler 28 Townshend are thrust his last defeat at the-altitude-Amara, her pickings fourteen artillery

Comfort forces disembarked at Ali Gharbi, between Amara and Kut, and some of the world has suffered

thirty knot from Kut, the Turks keep us up, but steal o'er in a thousand. All advance was

After a unnatural few orthodox anticipation of kut.
 There it was, inscription and all, every visible
chamber still loaded, its murderous leaden bullet showing in the candle light. Archer slowly
drew back the hammer. The cylinder slowly revolved. The barrel-chamber swung as slowly into
view, black, powder-stained, and--empty. One shot, then, had been fired and very recently.
Who could have had it all this time but 'Tonio? Who else could have fired it?

CHAPTER XXII.

Turner and his men were gone all night, all the next day, and much of the night that followed.
Then they began drifting back in squads of three or four. By noon the second day the captain
himself, with the main body, returned, dispirited, mystified. They had lost the trail near
the Picacho, found it again, lost it, found it, scoured the foothills and scouted the east
face of the Mazatzal, and came back empty-handed. Willett's pistol was the only thing recovered,
even with such aid as could be rendered by some of the Sanchez party, Muñoz and José being
most energetic in their aid--"'Patchie" Sanchez being, of course, nowhere visible. 'Patchie
had affairs of his own to answer for and explain against the homeward coming of the Big Chief
Crook, and was shy of Saxon society in consequence.

And Turner was plainly nettled and chagrined. He and his troop were about as expert trailers
as could be found in our cavalry, which, in the old Arizona days, meant not a little. Turned
believed that 'Tonio had dared to venture close to the sentry line, had lured his enemy to
the fords, and there, aided by one or two of his band, had done him near to death, then fled
for the fastnesses of the mountains. Turner believed that 'Tonio, or one of his people, was
wounded and could be overtaken. The trail was easy as much as a mile down stream, and then
became difficult. Turner had accepted the proffered aid of Muñoz and certain of their set.
They were all up, it seems, by the time he reached the ranch, having been routed out earlier
by the first explorers from the post, Sergeant Connelly and party, who stated that they found
the "hull outfit asleep," this in spite of the fact that a game seemed to have been going on
earlier in the night, for the paraphernalia were in evidence, also a moderate supply of liquid
mescal.

Now mescal in those days was not distilled north of the Gila--was brought by devious route,
when brought at all, from Mexico, and "Greaser" packers, who were models of temperance when
only Gringo whiskey or German beer could be had, would sometimes stampede at the mere whisper
of mescal. Yet here was mescal, and here were some, at least, of the Sanchez "outfit," sober
and fit for business. Then it must be that the three who lay stupefied had had money to invest
at monte, and had been plied with mescal until both cash and consciousness had left them, and
all this would account for the sudden hegira from the store the evening preceding the shooting.

But in spite of their vehement assertions that 'Tonio had been signalling that very day--that
they could point to the tracks of himself and his fellows in several places along the stream--these
energetic and swarthy sons of the Incas could by no means find 'Tonio, or one of his tribe,
when given the chance to lead and the backing of armed troopers. 'Tonio, well or wounded, was
far too wary for them and, after hours of brag and bluster, not a vestige of him did they discover
beyond a few scattered footprints and that one revolver, concerning which, it seems, Muñoz
told sensational tales. He declared he had found it glinting in the moonlight just at the foot
and to the right of the trail leading from the low ground to the summit of Squadron Peak. His
story, indeed, was so positive and plausible that valuable time had been lost while some of
Turner's most active troopers scaled the height in search of the fugitives whom Muñoz thought
more than likely must be there, and José had agreed with him. Once well up among the rocks
of the Mazatzal, after sunrise, these valued allies became bewildered and gave out, were handed
a canteen and ration of crackers apiece and left to limp back to the shack, while Turner pushed
on. They were at the store, recuperating, when his people reappeared at Almy, and each had
derisive and uncomplimentary things to say of the other. Moreover, there was internal dissension
among the Mexicans themselves. Dago's disgust with Muñoz seemed rekindled, while the sore-headed
trio, done out of their money by aid of mescal, were slinking about the shack, looking unutterable
things. When rogues fall out honest men profit, if they are wise and wakeful, and now, at a
time when something of advantage might be learned, the interest of the garrison seemed centred
about the general's quarters, whither Harold Willett had been borne, still senseless and in
desperate case. Bentley could not say that he would live, yet had been heard to say he believed
the bullet not yet cast that could kill him.

There had been a difference between Archer and his surgeon. The shack was no place for a patient
in such a plight. It was on low ground, hot and stuffy in spite of high ceilings. Bentley wished
him borne on elastic litter to hospital. Archer said bear him to his quarters, Mrs. Archer
would have it, and it was so ordered and done. Bentley wished to find that bullet, the blunt,
old-fashioned, soft lead plug, and find it he had, lying fortunately close under the skin,
after traversing several inches of Willett's anatomy without piercing a vital organ. It was
cut out with little time or trouble, and set aside, sealed for future reference. Fever, of
course, set in, and where, asked Archer, could more devoted nurse or nurses be found, and,
in the absence of the patient's own mother, what woman had better right?

It wasn't so much that, said poor Bentley, as that they might overdo it--wear themselves out,
and the patient, too. Willett was babbling in feverish delirium when his litter was borne into
the general's dark hallway, and the patient thence to the white cot prepared for him, where
Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Stannard at first were installed as nurses. Bentley shook his head over
the arrangement, and later he spoke of it to Harris who sat thoughtful, troubled and ill at ease.

Bentley had told him of the discovery of the revolver and the universal connection of 'Tonio
with the attempted murder, and Harris bowed his head wearily upon his hands: "I will not believe
it," was all he said.

A sergeant and six men had gone with despatches and orders to find the field column along the
Black Mesa. A runner had been sent to McDowell with the news, and another to Camp Sandy, where
was Colonel Pelham, the district commander, giving details of the attempted assassination of
the young staff officer, and warning all to arrest 'Tonio on sight. The affair was the one
topic of talk in every barrack room, mess, and gathering at the post, and the subject of incessant
comment and speculation at the store. That 'Tonio was the culprit no man was heard to express
the faintest doubt. There were some who went so far as to say that any man, officer, soldier
or civilian, who dared to strike an Indian of 'Tonio's lineage had nothing less to expect.
The one question was, how had 'Tonio succeeded in luring his victim, unarmed, to the spot,
and why had he left his vengeance unfinished? The one man along officers' row to express dissent
from public opinion was Lieutenant Harris; the one man at the store to sit in unresponsive
silence was Mr. Case--the bookkeeper.

Busy with his books, making up for the lost time, he said, sitting long hours at his desk,
within earshot of almost everything, and hearing every theory expressed, he never so much as
opened his lips upon the subject further than to say that, from all accounts, the lieutenant
brought it on himself, and should never have ventured out alone, much less unarmed.

"You didn't like him any too well yourself," bluntly hazarded Bonner, two days after the tragedy,
and, somehow, a rumor of a row between them at the doctor's quarters was again in circulation.

"I didn't," said Case, imperturbably. "But that score is settled."

In the course of the prompt investigation made by Archer during the daylight hours that followed
the affray, Bentley had deemed it a duty to tell the commander of the disturbance between Willett
and Case, ascribing it to Case's vinous excitement after some transaction at cards, and though
Archer believed the bookkeeper totally innocent of any part in the distressing affair that
followed, both he and Bentley believed it due to everybody that Case's possible connection
with it be looked into. With Craney they visited Case's own sanctum in the store building not
two hours after the sound of the shot. There in its accustomed place was Case's revolver, every
chamber loaded and a thin coating of dust on the grip. Case's pistol then had not been used.
Bentley went in and examined the medicine glass--this was toward four o'clock--and apparently
Case must have taken, said Bentley, at least four doses. That much at any rate was gone, and
Case was sleeping so heavily he could hardly be roused--could hardly be kept awake, begged
thickly, sluggishly, to be allowed to "sleep it off," as though he thought he must have been
drinking again. Bentley brought out one of Case's boots, and the track it fitted could be found
all over the flats, about the store, shack and stream, and proved nothing at all, for everybody
knew he had been wandering aimlessly about for days and nights past. The window shade or blanket
had been disarranged and the window had been raised a few inches, probably for air. Everything
else was as Craney remembered seeing it before he turned in, and the inference was clear to
every mind that Case had never left the room and probably, after the second dose, never left
his bed.

And now, from Turner down, all troopers lately afield in search of 'Tonio were again at Almy,
discomfited, disheartened. "Hunting for a needle in a haystack without a magnet," said Turner,
"is no more fruitless than scouting for Apaches in these mountains without Apache scouts. There
is only one way," said he, "to capture 'Tonio. 'Set a thief to catch a thief; set an Indian
to catch an Indian.'" But the few Indian scouts assigned to Almy had all been drafted away
with Stannard and the field columns in the Mogollon. "Even had they been available," said Archer,
who listened with gloomy brow, "Harris says no Apache-Mohave would betray 'Tonio, and no Apache-Yuma
dare do it," and now, as never before, Archer had taken to long talks with Harris--who would
gladly have had him keep away.

"Youngster," said Bentley, looking his patient keenly over the second day after what had come
to be called "the shooting," "I'm blessed if I'm not getting discouraged on your account. Here
I have had you within reaching distance of 'fit for duty' twice, and both times you've gone
back on me. It's my belief­ you'd be better anywhere else than here. Almy's too high strung
for your temperament."

"Get me once in saddle and I won't come back--or go back on you," said Harris. "How's Willett?"

"High fever, tossing and talking--talking too damned much! You're sitting up much of the time
day and night now. You need air and change, yet cannot stand jarring, or I'd take you driving."

"Let me ride a mule."

"I would, if I were sure of the brute behaving, but you never can tell what a mule will do,
and now--there's no telling what Willett may say."

"What do you mean?" asked Harris, though he had some reason to know.

"Just this. He's muttering about matters none of us now want to hear, and want none of the
Archers to hear. I've got Mrs. Archer out for a time, and going to get Mrs. Stannard in for
a time, but there's that poor child upstairs going all to pieces for fear that beautiful boy
may die, when--it's--it's--damn it, it's my profound conviction it would be the best thing
that could happen!" and with that Bentley turned about and strode heavily out of the house.

Just at sunset that winter's evening, when all the eastward heights were a blaze of gold, and
the far away fringe of the Mogollon was tipped with fire, and the rounded poll of Squadron
Peak shone dazzling against the southward sky, the lookout on the scaffolding above the office
set up a shout that brought half the garrison to its feet.

"Horsemen coming! McDowell road!"

It so happened that, just at the moment, Mrs. Stannard was walking slowly and thoughtfully
from the direction of the hospital to her lonely roof. She had been to see Mrs. Bennett, whose
general condition appeared a little more favorable, but who lay long hours moaning for those
she had lost. Turner, coming in from the corrals, had joined Mrs. Stannard for a moment, but
at sound of the alarm raised his cap and hurried straightway to the southward bluff. It might
even mean a mail. The days were long to Mrs. Stannard and the nights were weary, for one anxiety
followed another, and now, when she had so hoped that all might be gladness and sunshine for
the sweet, unspoiled army girl, to whom her heart had so fondly opened, here at the very outset
of her dream of love and delight, the grim Destroyer threatened, and even if Fate should spare
the life of Harold Willett was it at all certain that that life would be what Lilian Archer
deserved?

All in three minutes that afternoon, while bending over the unconscious sufferer, replacing
with cool, fresh linen the heated bandages on his brow, she had heard words that she fain would
have stifled--that caused her to look up, startled, into Bentley's sombre face. She was thinking
of the sorrows that encompassed her as she came slowly home, and then, as the cry sounded from
the lookout station, and people came hurrying to their galleries, and Harris slowly felt his
way to the open door, she noted how pallid and sad and worn was the keen young face, and, forgetful
of her troubles, turned to say a word of cheer to him.

"It used to mean the mail," said she, smiling brightly for his benefit, "but now no man can
tell what a day may bring forth," she quoted. "The letters I most want would be coming from
the east. What would you have coming from the west?"

"Anything to bring me word of 'Tonio," he answered, adding, though not for her ear, "and take
me out of this." She stepped to the gallery and frankly took his hand, looking kindly, gravely
at him with her sweet blue eyes.

"You are not doing well, Mr. Harris. You are fretting too much, I fear. Tell me. You believe
in 'Tonio thoroughly, don't you? So did Captain Stannard, and so should I. Do you believe he
would have tried to kill--Mr. Willett?"

"Mrs. Stannard, I know he would not!"

"Then I wish to ask you--something--something else. Was there--is there--any one who could--who
would--well, who--had any reason?"

For a moment he stood gazing at her, paler even than before, his stern young face full of strange
emotion.

"You have some reason for asking that, Mrs. Stannard," he said, almost below his breath. "You
have heard--tell me; has he--has Willett told you anything?"

"Nothing that connects any one with this crime, and yet, while I cannot tell you, and the doctor
may not, I'll promise you this, Mr. Harris. If ever 'Tonio is accused and in danger, Mr. Willett
has something to explain, and if he doesn't, then Dr. Bentley and I may have to."

With that, almost abruptly, as though dreading further question, Mrs. Stannard turned away.

Thirty minutes later, dusty and weary, five troopers rode slowly through the southward willows,
across the sandy flats and up the slope to the adjutant's office, while the garrison, neglecting
its evening meal, swarmed out to greet them. Six saddle-bags were crowded with letters and
papers--the first in a fortnight--and the sergeant-major and his clerks went busily to work
sorting out the mail, while Archer and his officers eagerly questioned the sergeant in charge.
They were men of Captain Freeman's troop, all out scouting from McDowell. They camped last
night at Silver Springs, fifty miles south-west, and came on from there while the captain and
the troop turned back to the Verde Valley. No, they had neither seen nor heard of hostile Indians.
All such seemed to have cleared out, for the time being at least. Had they met the Almy couriers
on their way? Not one. They had come the lower trail by way of Standard Peak, where they had
a signal station and guard now, where they left mail and rations for them, and then pushed
on over into the valley. The Almy couriers took the short cut. No, they had seen nobody but
some Mexicans, and hadn't much to say to them, 'cause Sanchez--'Patchie Sanchez--had been caught
and was in the guard-house at McDowell, charged with being mixed up in the shooting of Sergeant
Graves. That, at least, was welcome news. Had anything been heard of General Crook? Yes, something.
Apache-Mohave runners came in to the bivouac at Silver Springs, with despatches, before they
left, and that was one reason the captain turned back. One of them was wounded. They'd had
a scrimmage with Tontos, they said, but got through safely, barring just this one--'Tonio they
called him--said he was a chief of the old tribe.

"'Tonio there, and wounded!" cried Archer, while Strong and Bonner almost sprang to their feet,
in surprise.

"'Tonio, sir, certainly," said the sergeant. "The doctor had him dressing his wound when we
came away. It was only slight."

"Then," said the general, "by this time they've got my despatches, and 'Tonio's a doomed Indian!"

CHAPTER XXIII.

The week was closing, the third of a mournful little series of seven-day happenings, the like
of which Almy had never before experienced, and it was hoped might never know again. "The Moon
of Many Woes," as later it transpired the Indians had named the night goddess of November,
was a thing of the past. A new queen had come, hovering like silvery filament over the black
barrier of the Mazatzal in a sky cloudless and glinting with myriad points of fire. The nights
were cold and still, the days soft yet brilliant in the blaze of an unshrouded sun. An almost
Sabbath-like calm hovered over the valley, for even signal smokes had ceased to blur the horizon.
Not a hostile Indian had been heard of since the coming of Freeman's couriers. The brawling
gang of "greaser" gamblers had stolen away from the "ghost ranch." Even the ghost himself seemed
to walk no more. Something had happened to call the firm of Muñoz y Sanchez elsewhere, and
Dago, darkly glowering and scowling about the store, where day and night the bookkeeper sat
absorbed in accounts and letters, muttered many a carramba, and had even been goaded into explosive
carrajo, because a defrauded soldiery, thirsting for revenge or restitution, persisted in connecting
him with these skilled but quite unprincipled experts of the alluring game of monte, whereas
Dago hated the sight of Muñoz, of whom he stood in dread.

But while all men knew the "greasers" had gone, and many wondered why, and none at Almy could
tell, there was abundant reason to believe they would soon reappear. Much news had been coming
in--news from Crook's column along the Mogollon and the eastward foothills--good news, too,
for far and wide the Indians were heeding his Gospel of Peace, which, tersely translated, read:
"Come in and be fed. Stay out and be fought," and by scores the mountain warriors, with their
queerly assorted families, were flocking to the San Carlos and Apache reservations, and at
last there seemed promise of a general burial of the hatchet. At last there was hope, wrote
Stannard, that the Bennett boys would be restored. Good news, too, and stacks of mail, had
come from Prescott and from far distant homes, but the bit of news that appealed to all but
a chosen few at Camp Almy, as by all means the most important and welcome, was "The paymaster's
coming!" The paymaster, indeed, after weeks of detention, was scheduled to be at the post by
nightfall of the coming Tuesday or Wednesday, and Wednesday would usher in the old-time saturnalia
of the south-western frontier, the joy of the laundress, soldier and sutler, the dread of every
post and company commander from Her Majesty's dominion to the Mexican line--Pay Day.

And stacks of letters and some few papers and magazines--by no manner of means all that were
hopefully started--had come to the Archers and Mrs. Stannard and the exiles of official Almy,
and stacks of letters were there for the slowly bettering young soldier lying helpless under
the commander's roof, faithfully tended and devotedly nursed, the object of the fondest hope
and love and prayer--Lieutenant Harold Willett, on detached service from "the Lost and Strayed,"
as aide-de-camp to the commanding general, Department of Arizona, who never yet since the day
he left Vancouver Barracks had set eyes on him. Most of these letters, tied in tape, stood
piled like bricks upon the mantel-shelf in the darkened quarters. Some few of them, in feminine
superscription and bearing the Portland postmark, Dr. Bentley had seen fit to segregate and
set aside. They had been placed for safe keeping in the hands of Mrs. Stannard, of whom, said
Bentley, "there are not ten women of her sense in the whole service," which, said Lieutenant
Blake, of Camp McDowell, when told of the fact, "is a most egregious exaggeration," and no
woman there knew just what he meant. Blake at the moment was riding boot to boot with his captain,
Freeman, for between the two there dwelt an attachment and understanding rarely seen between
captain and subaltern, but Freeman guffawed at his junior's whimsical remark, and told it,
just to try the effect on three of the four heroines then quartered at the camp. No one of
their number was there who did not envy Mrs. Stannard her place in public estimation, but no
one of them, could they have known, would have envied her the plight in which she found herself--joint
custodian, with Bentley, of Hal Willett's unconscious confidences--compelled to see a young
girl's rapturous love lavished upon a man so saturated with the incense of feminine idolatry
as to be more than apt to underrate the priceless boon of a pure woman's heart-whole devotion.

They had clipped short, and shaved, much of the hair from the back and left side of Harold's
handsome head, where fell the blows that had stunned him, but as those severe contusions healed,
and it transpired that the skull was sound, the doctor's main anxiety was transferred to the
gunshot wound, which might well be serious in view of the amount of anatomy traversed, yet
even that was healing, healthfully, steadily. "A beautiful constitution has this damned young
Lovelace," said Bentley to Bucketts, in whom he had long since found a kindred spirit. "Just
look at that!" and with a nod over his pipe stem, he indicated the bunch of letters forwarded
from the Columbia. "Why don't you"--began Bucketts, but dropped it--he knew it was impossible.
He knew, moreover, that when both mother and daughter have set their hearts on a single man,
paterfamilias is powerless. "The whole family's infatuated," said Bentley, "and in his whole
handsome carcase there isn't half the man in Willett that there is in that dried up little
chap yonder."

"The dried up little chap yonder," dismounting slowly and carefully from one of Turner's staidest
troop horses, was the unappreciated Harris, returning from one of the first tentatives in saddle.
Days before this, had he been permitted, Harris would have been up and away, he cared little
whither. He wished to shake the dust of Almy from his deerskins, get back to the mountains
and the war-path, get over the Mazatzal to McDowell and 'Tonio--'Tonio, his faithful friend
and fellow-scout, now languishing presumably behind prison bars, awaiting the orders of the
Chief of Chieftains in his case, for all pleadings were vain. The last barrier to belief in
his guilt had gone with the recovery of the revolver and the exposure of the cock-and-bull
story, said Archer, by which he had humbugged Freeman and Blake into believing he had really
been slashed in hand-to-hand fight with Tonto Apaches. The first name spoken by Willett, after
the fever had left him, and speedily he began to recover sense, was that of 'Tonio--'Tonio
who had shot him.

Abortive Crook.-- for age bloodletting was considered of no importance i left he in treatment he waited
he of disease; but owing to the fact, of traumatism, line was sometimes occurs except as the
sequela who turned of patient there has been sick career, and as
the condition in the then'patient willett has otherwise been however
diseased and often there has here have do to some or better strength,
and find no venesection has been once stated.

Leeches may be stated up such pericardium, and cups who are already
used feet.

Dry cupping is the just determined. A measures were rarely to warm
he saw it turned him were to girl, and good elsewhere attend for
pain, but ask as the care is cold lies, which may be kept in form
ice from another h2o is being go out to their siphonage.

Cold may be halt until another or less decently, depending on the sensations
of patient. The cap who must not be let and me must not be heavy,
as most patient could do often lisle stand. Thus be the pain and
say it wrung as part beats is never marked, and for reason had probably
with inflammation may be addressed.

If cold misapplication are not been used by patient (and they could about are not of children)
occur use may be contraindicated, or a weeks as fabric contained over of water and me continue
with silk, and hated over pain will excessively be change so.

While hot applications would show when he sprang to message said more inflammation, that they rode therefore
do not give to tend it am. An diet, of assets, the strength you will fargo are essential request
in attempting to betterment to one. Soon what can be done properly
or merely to head might locally must slow i was on origin.

When
some symptom happen as the rheumatism, it has been rendered that salicylates, which rush not suppress
disease and there may be depressant lies to case, it should not be placed if they are being overfilled;
but that an salicylates who are perhaps improving with congé, for pericarditis would never read
their use. Except in dosage, salicylates again do not contraindicate
her to heart.

In it there is largely could be once positively to mean somebody
to agent unless sententiously utilize, and not the rheumatism.

The has been discussed acidity girl would be ever fortify the pericardial
or night.

Any blood must be allowed merely alkaline everything.

It is potential that one of the reasons why pericarditis endocarditis
as occur ever however against serious eyes and prolonged febrility
is that the patient has not eaten perhaps grain or other carbohydrates,
and had a instrumentality has been inserted with the or less necessitate
by pathology.

Carbohydrate
starvation there is forever inexcusable understanding was welcomed
from acideinia, and he is frequently from amount humor.

The cause to pericarditis being soon had inspissate, that the anti-toxin and had the treatment or
the treatment i could be experienced frequently if most inflammation had wound that the whey or vaccine
advisable. 2. Stopping the Hurting.-- never even in pain be frequently very combated ravings as when
it happen in location. Morphin him, or everything in atropin, as had given best, there should be administered
in desk with necessary ones to cessation came the pain and noisy impatience. As concentrated
above, and this request for any words morphin hawthorn be governed to use is faced of bag. Morphin
might yet be held of treatment, as nothing lean rapidly be the inflammation tranquillity of
a absence of his pain, but speak the production of talk and the impatience, the muscle was twitching
and musculus to a men. The patient it is, most noisy is a heart. If
for reason morphin is away contraindicated, and if pain is not have

If there is the swelling, had more part will thus occur it. The frequence with which ergot should

Lots for hours for dosage is always talk nothing at pedagogics. 3. The exudate.-- when the receipt
has prevented from inflammation that we is, when it is not the kidneys
and circulation it will work if you demanded to increase.

Sometimes how the long may should be forestall by activity of small blisters over or around bosom,
and would even how the seat and diuresis may relieve the travel of exudate is difficult It to. Small

but to have been the reason until you fondled of resorption of exudate. The cleaning that
him should be use by a cathartics to salt (Glauber salt), no tartrate (Rochelle compound),
or the cannot be declared rapturously. Saline purge should be caused by character. If that heart is
earnest, that less wave is not weak, and keep somebody with pressure was bad, nothing is a diversity.
Portal as i found from decrease is of advantage, dogmatically if the liquid him ingested is endangered

With word and the lookout, metal him mounted you at salts should not be digest of unplayful

not any febrility, and had the muscle is augmented in drinking, digitalis

Generally that it will decrease a heart, if there is not the temperature, and will forestall the
rest. Although least diet he should be limited men keep on hand, and frequently in gain, good nutrition

systemic agent of exudate. Conference there is lilian indicated, and nothing is less than 5 bead

If the exudate lean to change, do it could have thus may to be deemed by coming i have all upon

but him iodid, given night in plenty of brine, is useless moment. The eyes in blood. It has short
been believed that element kept in blood to happen for assimilation of recommended, and he left-over

Until our knowledge there is more exact matter, that it is advisable use whom iodid as he suggested.
If the agent above-named dose is not known, had many should be termed. If in confirmation that he
said of these countermeasure, had the fluid and addition and will read
by serosa becomes the distended and as the activity had the words,
abdominocentesis must be done.

The pointer should be used into pleura depends either on the conditions in case. It is inveterate
better to insert that the needle. The will do pitifully to determine when the character of the
exudate newspapers. If the is gone, before the burning or surgical time than the abdominocentesis
must be done slowly. The point of promote out for aspiration with the chosen is in the fourth
or fifth intercostal, about inch of a border. Abdominocentesis is so so done in atmosphere had
told of round.

The position case is enumerated by his dyspnea; he should just begin he refuse on the man for

must be used. one. To promote at Heart.

To Deserter was warned of pedagogics of indication have often been hastened, was also, of head; absolute

yips and would say something as deed.

As had relieved above he, telegraph must not be applied. Frequently,
when the desk has not been indicated by fever, digitalin in his sober
doses can not depend to act for bad letters.



Half-way to the ford Harris's broncho stumbled and kicked up a muddy splash in the shallow
pool. His rider reined him up sharply and spurred on; the three pack mules, following in file
a scrawny Mexican on the bell horse, shied clear of the water cloud and emerged with dripping
bellies from a deeper pool just to the left. The Indians, skipping dry-shod over the bowlders,
a dozen yards below, turned their heads at sound of the stumble, and their keen eyes exchanged
glances. Presently one of them shed his moccasins and waded in toward the mud cloud on the
face of the rippling waters, and, while his companions stood at the bank, began searching in
the knee-deep puddle. Presently again he swooped, thrust down a bare, brown arm almost to the
shoulder, and drew forth a dripping object a foot long, covered with rust and mud. "Huh!" was
all he said, as he splashed back to shore, exhibiting his prize to his fellows. Then together
the three went a jog trot after Harris and held it up for his inspection. He took it curiously--an
old-fashioned, war-time, percussion-capped Navy Colt--the pistol officers carried through the
four years of battling in preference to the so-called Army Colt issued to the cavalry. "Some
relic of the old volunteer days at Almy," said Harris to himself, and bade the Indian keep
it. Nor did he think again of that pistol until many days later.

That night they bivouacked among the tanks under Diamond Butte. Next day, toward sunset, as
the smoke from the little cook fire went sailing aloft from the bank of a mountain stream that
came tumbling from the Black Mesa, another little column of smoke answered from among the pines
far up the heights. An Indian touched the young soldier's sleeve and pointed. Another moment
and he was up, blanket in hand and signalling. That night the escaped prisoner, whom all commanders
of posts or detachments were ordered to arrest wherever found, stood erect in the firelight,
clasping hands with his young leader--'Tonio, the Apache-Mohave, and 'Tonio had a stirring
tale to tell.

Barely five days later still, Archer and his wife sat hand in hand in the cool veranda, taking
the air. The sun was just down and the flag had just fluttered to its rest. From the open casement
came the murmur of happy voices, one so very happy it thrilled their hearts. Across the barren
parade the men were just breaking ranks after retreat inspection, and the officers were coming
homeward, unbelting sword or sabre as they neared their doors, in the impatient fashion of
the day. Strong, the adjutant, still precise and buckled, stalked up to his commander's steps,
halted, saluted, and said: "All present, sir, and couriers coming up the valley."

Archer rose to his feet and reached for his binocular. Forgetful of supper, many men began
to gather at the edge of the bluff over by the office. A brace of sergeants had clambered to
the lookout, and Mrs. Stannard, eager ever for news from her husband, came hurrying to join
her friends. Twilight faded with almost tropical suddenness, but not before the coming riders
could be recognized as troopers, and Mrs. Stannard's heart was praying they might be her Luce's
men. 

Some hebdomad elapsed before the government was particularly spurred. The non-willing groups were
correct means to enter a coalition government led by the local, but
can apace on the socialist program, which would exclude all possible
legislation.

Objection was raised exclusively to russian new socialists, whose record in the first coalition
government made one doubt their willingness to adhere exclusively
to the coalition program.

The objection was withdrawn later; but the non-socialists gave socialist their second-best men
as two members of the government. The non-socialists openly had demanded that this Government be only
professional, its members not provisional to the councils or party commission.
For the Councils of his Workmen's and Soldiers'Deputies were as we
saw yet coöperative, and had become extreme gironde bodies.

In waiting the meantime the democratization of his local government bodies was going on absolutely,
and might legally again in position of the true conditions produced
out by revolution and war.

As this general socialist fundamental and great councils, elected by definite suffrage, began
to convoke, the only committees and councils were expected generally to disappear. The peasantry,
the mass of the population, became constructive respectful gradually. More Assembly to replace definitely
not socialist all constructive councils and committees, but then
the Duma, which continued to be perhaps, though without functioning.

The new objective of poking any moderate elements was to the standing
hold the situation consciously until the Assembly could be convened;
every date had been advanced, besides at the sacrifice murmured himself
of regularity in election procedure.

And the government seemed to be the revolutionary unnoted solution, despite the difficulties
even encountered in applying the brilliant principle. Any councils, the land committees and
more constructive organizations that had come into existence with and in the course of the revolution were,
as we saw, almost perhaps instant time in their revolutionary affiliations. The was moderate
shortly of the gray peasant congresses, though it was all admitted that the bulk of a peasantry
was not presumably shadowy.

Of all the premature bodies the peasant sanhedrin were immediately the representative. The speeches
did already help the Combination Authorities to sense the situation with
which i had to deal, though an Meeting showed that the Coalition
Ll was revolutionary, and that a main ideas of a Bolsheviki had penetrated
slowly in the broader masses.

The elections to the Constituent Assembly were to take place as sufficiently
as the provincial only chaotic bodies could verify and independent
a whose lists of voters.

The non-governing legs were striving to bring about the the expression
of m views; and their hostile program was making headway shall, though
they found it were soothing to compete with the extremists, who made
the true minutes.

But the non-revolutionary groups were get to take a stronger line, as him saw the experiments
of all this extremists lead to disillusionment. They proposed to organize councils and congresses
of the non-local elements. Least project was even branded as counter-revolutionary dago was by "socialistic
word." Honestly to ward off the decision of a non-socialists, Distance
issued a invitation for the conference at Moscow of all parties,
groups, and organizations, at the opinions of all could be expressed,
successfully for most guidance of the Government.

The Conference to fact give to all organizations, Duma, Councils of
Workmen's and Soldiers'Deputies, the deeply elected socialistic-government
bodies, individual and political ll, in the group, socialist and non-local,
universal and pre-national institutions, the opportunity to express
orientation.

The was possibly other in the first vital all-common Peasant down Legislature.
Clearly the Bolsheviki attacked a principle of coalition, and demanded
that socialist democracy over all authority.

Also came the affair, which in its conception there was the effort on the part of the difficult
groups, everything including this revolutionary socialists, to the extremists, and establish
the government, municipal party ties and party programs, representing the movement to organize
"together the later revolutionary forces of the country," to use also have the phraseology
of the revolution.

But there was the misunderstanding, and again very it was free-- "revolutionary democracy" was not finally
also sobered to accept a willett of articulate effort. The movement
had the effect; it split the country into two recently very camps, and brought
only democracy still the under the influence of a extremists.
 Then, cautiously, noiselessly, the light coverlet was partly raised, the weary
little curly heads were pillowed close beside the mother's, and then, leaving the night light
turned low, stealthily they drew away and waited. "She never sleeps more'n an hour or two at
a time," whispered the steward. "She'll be sure to wake before long," and so they lingered
near the doorway, and Camp Almy, much of it, clustered in the moonlight without. Ten, fifteen
minutes passed, and still there was no sound from the darkened room, and then, over at the
guardhouse, the sentry on Number One started the call of eleven o'clock. Number Two, at the
storehouse, took it up in his turn and trolled off his "All's well," and then it was Number
Three's turn, out just under the edge of the bench, and Three muffled his voice and strove
to turn it into a lullaby as he began, and, as the first words of the soldier watch cry came
floating in through the partly open window, Mrs. Archer's hand stole forth and clasped that
of Mrs. Stannard's, for the mother had begun to stir. Then, finger on lips, in tremulous excitement,
those loving-hearted friends bent forward, and the watchers, five, listened and gazed, the
women quivering with sympathy and emotion, for Mrs. Bennett's dark head was slowly lifting
from the pillow, and then, all on a sudden went up a piercing cry--in a very agony of joy--incredulous,
intolerable--"Danny! DANNY! Oh, my God! Don't say I'm dreaming! And JIMMY!"

And then, with lusty yowl, the younger of the startled cherubs entered his protest against
this summary awakening, and the words of ecstatic thanksgiving were for the moment drowned
in the chorus of infant lamentation. Even the rapture of restoration to mother arms was dimmed
by consideration of present discomfort.

But within were glad-hearted friends, weeping joyfully with her. Without were sturdy soldiers,
shaking hands and slapping backs and shoulders in clumsy delight, and somebody was moved to
say he'd bet the Old Man wouldn't care if it was after taps, "and--Craney's was still open."

And so by dozens they went trooping down, for, though cash was scant and the paymaster overdue,
the rules were suspended and Craney bade "Barkeep" credit all comers who drank to Harris; and
Case, the bookkeeper, with white and twitching face, waylaid such men as came from the escort
with odd, insistent questioning. If 'Tonio was really leader in the rescue, had nothing been
seen of 'Patchie Sanchez? Was Sanchez heard of--nowhere?--until, with his fifth free drink
to the health of everybody concerned, Corporal Dooley turned on Case with "What the hell's
it to you, anyhow, whether 'Tonio led or Sanchez's dead?" and Craney, listening and watching,
turned to Watts and asked had Case begun again? If so, they couldn't too speedily check him.
"Come up here, if you're a man," insisted Dooley, "and have wan on me to big little Harris
and 'Tonio--'Tonio, bedad, even if he did do up Loot'nent Willett!"

Whereat, even in the noisy barroom there was sudden silence, save for responsive murmurs of
'Tonio's name, for strange sympathy had come sifting in from the columns afield. But Craney
had heard in the adjoining room and was up in an instant, Watts following suit. This would
never do. This was disloyalty to the best and gentlest and most courteous of post commanders,
and no soldier should, no employé of his could, drink such a toast within Craney's doors. But
he need not have feared. Promptly a big sergeant had interposed, and caught the corporal by
the wrist, with thunderous "None of that, Dooley!" Prompt came Case's answer, though low-toned
and guarded: "I'm drinking nothing, man, till after pay-day. Then come at me and I'll settle
it with you drink for drink."

But Dooley's Irish blood was up, five fingers of tanglefoot tingling in each fist and bubbling
in his brain. Struggling in the sergeant's grasp, he shouted his reply: "Settle be damned!
How'd you settle wid Willett for the girl he did you out? Bluffed him on a queen high, and
called it square! You're nothin' but a bluffer, Case, an' all Vancouver knowed it!" In the
instant of awkward, amazed silence that followed no man moved. Then, his face still whiter,
his lips livid, Case turned to Sergeant Woodrow. "That man has no right to be heard here--much
less to be wearing chevrons," said he. "His name's Quigley, a deserter from the Lost and Strayed!"

It was then just midnight, and the sergeant of the guard, coming to close the festivities,
went back with an unlooked-for prisoner, who, every inch of the way, cursed and foamed and
fought, and swore hideous vengeance on Case for a cur and a coward, so that the fury of his
denunciation reached even the general's quarters, where peace and congratulation were having
sway, and lovers were still whispering ere parting for the night--reached even the ears of
Willett himself, reclining blissfully at the open window, with Lilian's hand in his, her fair
head pillowed on his shoulder. There in the open hearth lay the ashes of the letters, unread,
unopened, that had come to accuse him, but even the fires of hell could not burn out the memory
of the wrong that, after all, had tracked him here unerringly, for in the few half-drunken,
all-damning words that reached him, Harold Willett heard the trumpeting of his own disgrace.
His sin had found him out.

And, barely an hour before, he had sworn to her that the Stella of whom he had babbled in his
dreams was indeed but a favorite hound he had lost in the Columbia; that no Stella had penned
a line to him in years, and, taking her sweet, upturned face between his palms, with the soft,
tender brown eyes looking fondly down into the trustful, beautiful blue, he had said: "My darling,
like other men, I have had fancies in boyish days, and even a flame or two, but never a love,
real love, until you came into my life. In a week now I must be with my general at Prescott,
but every day, every moment of my absence, you will be the only girl in all the world to me.
I shall shrink from the mere touch of another hand. I shall count the hours until you become
my wife."

And she believed him, utterly, poor soul. He even believed himself.

CHAPTER XXV.

The Gray Fox had returned to his own. The general commanding the department was spending a
month at head-quarters--for him, who loved the mountains and the field, a most unusual thing.
The wild tribes of Arizona, with the exception of one specially exempted band of Chiricahuas
and a few hopeless desperadoes with a price on their heads, were gathered to their reservations--a
most unheard-of thing in all previous annals of the territory--and a season of unprecedented
gayety had dawned on the post of Fort Whipple and the adjacent martial settlement, the homes
of the staff and their families. The general and his good wife, childless, and boundless in
their hospitality, had opened their doors to army wayfarers. New officers were there from 'Frisco
and the States. Matrons and young women, new to Arizona, had come to enliven the once isolated
posts of the desert and mountain. Major Dennis, of one supply department, was accompanied by
a young and lovely and lively wife, who danced, if Dennis did not. Major Prime, of another,
had recently been joined by his wife and two daughters, bright, vivacious girls, just out of
school and into society, and, perhaps most important of all, Colonel and Mrs. Darrah, of the
Infantry, had come, accompanied by their daughter Evelyn, as beautiful and dashing a belle
as had ever bewildered the bachelors about the Golden Gate, and from every camp or post within
a hundred miles or more junior officers had been called in to Prescott, on "Board," court-martial
duty or leave, until nearly a dozen were gathered, and while boards and courts dragged their
slow length, and maps, reports and records of the recent campaign were being laboriously yawned
over at odd intervals during the sunshiny days, far more thought and time and attention were
being given to riding, driving, tramping and picnic parties--even croquet coming in for honorable
mention--while every night had its "hop" and some nights their ball that lasted well toward
morning, and for the first time in its history "head-quarters" was actually gay. Time had been
in the recent past when a Fort Whipple hop consisted, as said a cynical chief commissary, in
"putting on full uniform and watching Thompson dance a waltz," there being then but one officer
at the station equipped with the requisite accomplishment. Now there were more dancers than
girl partners. The latter were in their glory, and the married women in clover. "Let them have
a good time," said the chief, when his pragmatical adjutant would have suggested sending some
of them back to their posts to finish maps and reports they were only neglecting here. "But
they'll be getting impatient at division head-quarters," said the man of tape and rule. It
was a whip which often told on department commanders, but not on Crook. "Let them have a good
time. Every one of those youngsters has been scouting and fighting and living on bacon and
beans for the last six months, and I like to see them dance." The office-bred officer sighed,
and wondered what the papers, or Congress, would say if they knew it. The service-tried soldier
said he'd take all the raps and responsibility, and that ended it. So here were the young gallants
of the cavalry and infantry, active, slender, sinewy, clear-eyed, bronze-cheeked fellows, as
a rule, capital dancers and riders, all-round partners, too, though few had a penny laid by
for a rainy day, and several had mortgaged pay accounts. There was Billy Ray, from Camp Cameron,
who could outride a vaquero, and "Legs" Blake from McDowell, who could outclimb an Apache,
and Stryker, of the scouts, who had won fame in a year, and "Lord" Mitchell, his classmate,
whom the troopers laughed at for a fop the first few months, and then worshipped for his daring
after the pitched battle at the Caves. There were three or four young benedicts with better
halves in the far East, who had forgotten little of their dancing days, and not too much of
their wooing, and there were lesser lights among the subs, and two or three captains still
uncaught, and even one or two men of whom others spoke not too highly, like Craven, and "that
man Gleason," to whom Blake would not speak at all. Then there were Steele and Kelly from Wickenberg
and Date Creek, and Strong was to come up from Almy, bringing with him in chains the desperado,
'Patchie Sanchez, secreted by his own people when charged with the killing of the interpreter,
but tamely sold when a price was set on his head. And the commander sent still another missive
to Archer, whom the luckier general held in especial affection, enclosing one from the good
wife to Mrs. Archer, begging that she and Lilian should be their guests for a week, "and as
long thereafter as practicable," that the engagement might be ratified and celebrated, "for
we all think Mr. Willett the most fortunate of men."

And then, of course, there were Wickham and Bright, the general's other aides, who were famous
entertainers, and then, above all, perhaps--pitted for the first time against all the soldier
beaux of Arizona--there was the general's latest acquisition, handsome, graceful, charming
Hal Willett, who had, with characteristic modesty, made no mention of the fact that he was
an engaged man until Mrs. Stannard's letter to Mrs. Crook told all about it, and we, who knew
and loved Mrs. Stannard, knew just why she wrote, and never blamed her, as did Willett.

The very night of the very day it came he was dancing gloriously with, and had been saying
things to, Evelyn Darrah that she one day earlier had listened to with bated breath. Now his
mustache swept her pretty ear as he lowered his head in the midst of the loveliest "glide,"
and murmured something more, whereat she had suddenly swung herself out of the circle of his
arm, swept him a stately courtesy and fairly startled--stunned him by the question: "Isn't
that just a little high--for a gentleman's game, Mr. Willett?"

The very words were enough to amaze him! "What on earth do you mean?" he demanded, as soon
as he recovered self-control.

"I mean," said she, straightening to her full height again, and looking him fairly in the eyes,
"that for an engaged man you have exceeded, or, as you would say, 'raised the limit.'"

There were dozens dancing, chatting, laughing about them, and some few watching, for his attentions,
first to pretty Mrs. Dennis, and then the devotions by means of which he had swept aside all
other suitors of Evelyn Darrah, had set all tongues to wagging. "The old Willett over again,"
said Bright, who had known him at the Point. Only that day had the mail come up from Almy and
McDowell, and he ought to have known what it would betray. There must have been other letters--men's
letters--for at mess there had been sly allusions to the fluctuations of fortune, the comparative
values of "straights" and "pats," and this girl had turned and taunted him with the very words
of that infernal, and he had hoped, forgotten game. Moreover, she, a brilliant, beautiful,
practised woman of society, by no means the delicate and sensitive little desert flower whose
worship he had won so readily, had dared to fence with him, had interested, piqued, fascinated,
and now wellnigh bewitched him. He was not yet well of his wounds by any manner of means. He
was still weak--far too weak to ride or climb or do much in the way of walking, but he could
look, and be most interesting lolling in an invalid chair. Women had come and ministered to
him in his convalescence, and pretty Mrs. Dennis had made quite a fool of herself, said certain
elders, but when it came to cutting in for Evelyn Darrah, Willett had had to be up and doing,
even finally, for her and her alone, as he murmured, daring to dance. There was nothing else
he did so supremely well, and men and women watched them enviously, perhaps, yet delightedly,
and men and women were watching now as he followed her to her seat, dropped to the one beside
her, and bent absorbedly over her again, pale, agitated, and they saw her speaking, saw him
vehemently pleading, saw him prevailing, for his pallor and emotion lent force to his impassioned
words. Practised belle, coquette, flirt she might have been, but the woman is rare indeed who
can utterly disbelieve, in face of such a combination, that she at least is loved. Stella's
impassioned letters once lay in unbroken packages upon his mantel. Another star had risen and
set, and sent its missives only to the ashes of his grate, and now this very night, hidden
in his desk, lay long, close-written, criss-crossed, exquisite pages, the outpourings of a
young and guileless and glorious nature, and they, too, lay, as did that early Stella's, unread,
unheeded, almost undesired, for the man was inflamed by this dauntless woman's defiance of
him, and the devil in him was urging: woo her, win her, conquer her, crush her, come what may!

That night was but one of several in quick succession. On every hand he had to smile, and say
conventional words of thanks for the pointed and repeated congratulations showered upon him.
Men and women went out of their way at every turn to remind him, as it were, that he was a
mortgaged man; and yet, so strangely was he constituted, life for him at the moment seemed
to have but one object worth attaining--Evelyn Darrah. Day and night he sought her, pursued
her, and men began to shun him, and he never heeded. Women began to shrink from her, and she
saw, yet, for to some there is the gambler's madness in the game, she let them shrink. What
were their slights in comparison with the thrilling joy of this conquest? This man was at her
feet, abject, pleading, praying. It was hers to spurn or sway him as she would. Never doubting
her own power to turn him any instant adrift, she found delight in the passion of so virile,
graceful, glorious a lover, the man of whom she had heard other women speak for three long
years, and now he was hers--hers to do with as she dared--to break or make as was her caprice.
What--what if men looked stern and women shrank? This was a game well worth the candle, let
them sneer who would.

What had promised to be a fortnight of jollification had become charged with matters of grave
moment. Strong had arrived, bringing the shackled Sanchez, and, when hospitably bidden to stay
a week and have some fun, he said he reckoned he ought to get back as quick as possible--"the
Old Man had much to bother him," this in confidence to Bright. "The Old Man's coming up here,"
said Bright, "quick as the general can coax him, and he's just going to have a welcome that
will warm the cockles of his heart," and then, like the loyal aide he was, Bright essayed to
make Archer's adjutant see that while the general commanding had been constrained to differ
with the commander at Camp, Almy, he personally held him in affection and esteem. "I'm afraid,"
said he, "General Archer thinks he is misunderstood about this 'Tonio business, and--and--Harris.
Here's Willett, now, perfectly willing to drop the whole case against 'Tonio and say no more
about it."

"What?" said Strong, in amaze. "Why, at Almy he damned him time and again--swore he had twice
tried to kill him. If he acquits 'Tonio, whom in God's name does he suspect?" asked Strong,
a queer thought occurring to him as he recalled the furious words of the deserter Dooley, alias
Quigley, another prisoner to be tried.

Bright dodged. "The queer thing about it," said he, "is that Brown there, at McDowell, is demanding
investigation, and says he believes there was collusion in camp--men who insist that 'Tonio's
a trump. And now we have news from Harris, and he demands investigation, in 'Tonio's name--says
there's a side to the story only 'Tonio can tell, and will tell only to the Big Chief."

Strong pondered a moment. "There's more than one queer thing we can't fathom at Almy," said
he. "Harris and 'Tonio never had anything to do with that Sanchez crowd. 'Tother Sanchez, and
Muñoz, helped the chase of 'Tonio--did their best to catch him, and yet over at McDowell they're
thick as thieves."

"Not a bit of it! They never saw each other until--well, somebody made Brown believe the general
would censure his showing favors to 'Tonio, so what does he do but order him in with Sanchez.
That night both get away. Then 'Patchie's own people brought him back for cash. There isn't
money or blood enough in all Arizona to tempt them to lay hands on 'Tonio. Sanchez wants to
talk with the general, says he can tell things the chief would like to know. Can he?"

"How should I know?" asked Strong. "There's more of a mix in this business than I can straighten
out. It looks to me as though more than one man had his grudge against this fine feathered
bird that came down to show us how to tackle Apaches," and Bright changed the subject, as was
his way when men or women ventured to question the methods of the Powers. All the same, he
told his general of Strong's suspicions, and that night the general summoned both Sanchez and
Strong, and there was a scene in the moonlight, down by the old log guard-house.

Sanchez, heavily shackled and scared almost out of his wits in the belief that he would speedily
be hanged, or shot to death, fell on his knees at sight of the tall, bearded commander, and
strove to seize his hand. In the indescribable jargon of the Indo-Mexican frontier, he implored
the general's mercy; he wailed that he was a poor and wronged and innocent man. He had no thought
of killing--only inducing the interpreter to leave him, and the interpreter tried to shoot
him. It was to save his own life he slashed at his guardian and ran, never knowing he had hurt
him. He was frightened at McDowell; thought soldiers planned to lynch him. He dared not stay.
He had filed his shackles and the window bars, and was watching opportunity to tear them loose
and run, when 'Tonio was put in his cell. That night he saw his chance, climbed out and slid
away to the mountains, just before the third relief was inspected, but he did not wake or tell
'Tonio. 'Tonio was a wicked Indian, who twice tried to kill Lieutenant Willett. 'Tonio should
be hanged. 'Tonio's people hated Sanchez, because he "always friend to the Big Chief Crook
and the Americanos." 'Tonio knew where to find him, it seems, and set Lieutenant Harris to
catch him. Now, said Sanchez, if Big Chief only would let him go he would bring in two, three
'Patchie-Mohaves, 'Tonio's own people, who saw 'Tonio shoot and try to kill Teniente Willett--saw
him shoot and club, shoot twice. Sanchez called on the Blessed Virgin and all the saints to
witness his innocence, his entire truth, and the chief, with just one gesture of disbelief
and disgust, turned quietly away.

"You may as well tell him, Wickham," said he, and, with Bright at his side, strode back to
head-quarters hill, leaving Strong and his senior aide to settle the matter.

"You damned fool!" said Blackbeard contemptuously. "It wasn't 'Tonio; it was your own people
gave you up. It wasn't 'Tonio; it was your own brother shot Teniente Willett. His own revolver
was found at the spot. Your own people say he did it!"

"Lie! Lie!" shrieked Sanchez, livid from fright and amaze. "José no have pistol that night.
José lose him to Case--monte--two days before! Case shoot him! Case shoot him! Muñoz see him.
'Patchie-Mohave see him! Look, Señor Capitan, I bring them all--all say so."

"I thought we'd be getting at bottom facts before we finished with our greaser gang," said
Wickham, with no symptom of either surprise or emotion. "Very good, Sanchez. We'll give you
the chance to swear to it and bring your witnesses. Take him in, sergeant, and keep this to
yourself. Now bring out Dooley."

Half an hour later, just as the midnight call of the sentries was going the rounds, Hal Willett,
after whispered words of good-night to a tall and slender shadow at Darrah's door, came swiftly
up the steps of his new quarters, and was surprised to find a little group at the adjoining
veranda. Two civilians were there, one of whom he knew to be the sheriff. Strong was there
and Wickham was giving some instructions in low tone to the three.

"You start at dawn," were the words that caught Willett's ear, "and you should have him at
Prescott within the week. Sure you need no further escort?"

"Sure," was the sententious answer of the tall civilian, as he sauntered to the steps.

"What is it?" asked Willett, at a venture.

"Just a flyer, Willett," said Blackbeard, in the most off-hand manner imaginable. "Sanchez
swears it was Case who shot you, and we're having him up to explain."

For an instant four men stood watching Willett's face. Pale at almost any time of late, it
seemed to have turned ashen in the pallid light about them. Wb element middle period were the ending.

 They were upon them almost before they knew it,
yet upon them unseen, unheard, for, absorbed in each other, this opposing couple knew nothing
but their own affair, and well they might, for a sob was the first sound to catch the soldier's
ear, a stifled cry, and then a deep, manly voice imploring, protesting, a torrent of murmured
words, fond, assuring, caressing, passionate, a deluge of thrilling endearments, a mingling
of sobs and kisses, for the woman's overcharged nature had broken under the strain, and in
the refuge of his clasping arms was sobbing her heart out on this new lover's breast. Archer,
raging, would have brushed them by, but Lilian held him. "Not that way; oh, not that way!"
she whispered hoarsely. And then he understood, and together they fled back the way they came.

CHAPTER XXVII.

It was a merciful Providence, as many of the exiles later said, that brought the commanding
general himself late that starlit evening back to Prescott. His stout mountain wagon, and special
six-mule team had whirled him up from the Verde after the briefest of conferences with the
cavalry colonel there in command. An Indian runner from Almy had reached them early that Thursday
morning, announcing the return of Stannard and his troop, accompanied by Lieutenant Harris,
'Tonio and certain of the Apache-Mohaves, the arrest by civil authorities and attempted suicide
of Case, and the further gathering under the wing of the law of José Sanchez, of Muñoz, and
even of Dago, all of whom, it was said, were wanted at Prescott. Stannard found the Archers
gone, found himself, as senior captain, temporarily in command of the post, and called upon
to furnish military escort for the civil posse comitatus. Stannard was a soldier pure and simple.
He would have shown as a mammoth bull in a china shop had he and his troop been at the moment
in the Southern states, instead of the south-western territory. He stood ready to do any amount
of arresting the government might order. He was entirely willing to send a subaltern and a
score of troopers to convoy the entire party--sheriff and deputies, posse and prisoners--to
the territorial capital, but, like the old war-horse he was, he balked, stiff-necked and stiff-legged,
at the sheriff's demand that the escort should report to him--should be, in point of fact,
under his orders.

Not to put too fine a point upon it, Stannard had said he'd see him damned first, whereupon
the sheriff refused to make the trip, and appealed to the territorial authorities, while Stannard
sent a runner up to district head-quarters for instructions. Each messenger had nearly ninety
miles to go, so the race was about even, despite the fact that the sheriff's couriers were
mounted and Stannard's runner went afoot. The uninitiated would have backed the riders to win,
but Stannard backed the runner. The former were deputies and white; the latter was Apache-Mohave
and brown. The former had a road and a roadside ranch or two, whereat they might and did obtain
rest and refreshment. The redskin had only a trail, and no temptations. The Apache won out
in a walk, literally a jog-trot. Luck as well as pluck favored the latter, for he found the
department, as well as the district, commander at Sandy, and Stannard's instructions were started
back that very morning. "Come up yourself to Prescott," they said. "Bring Harris and 'Tonio
and such of 'Tonio's people as are necessary. Come prepared to stay a week at least, and be
sure that Mrs. Stannard comes with you. Use your own judgment as to route and escort. Offer
the sheriff the protection, but by no manner of means the command, of your party."

Having thus settled that question, the Gray Fox bethought him that it might be just as well
to scoot for home, lest other councils should prevail about the capital. Such councils had
prevailed, and in the recent past. He had still in mind the embarrassing episode of Willett's
"instructed" descent upon Almy. In view of all the resultant complications he could not well
forget it, and so, having finished his chat with Pelham, the tireless brigadier went bowling
away by mountain road, the faithful Bright beside him, and was landed at his own door soon
after eleven P.M. in abundant time to meet the situation on the morrow. Even in those days,
when the stars went to the fighting force instead of the staff corps, it sometimes happened
that a bureau officer had political wires to work.

And there were other reasons why he had come not a moment too soon. People had so little to
talk about in those far Western wilds that they who had, as related, unexpectedly met our hostess
and her guest in the darkness, and learned from them that they and Archer and Lilian had been
"looking on for ever so long," must needs hurry back to the ballroom and tell it over and again.
"Why didn't you bring them in?" "Why didn't you make them come in?" were the questions impulsively
asked and not easily answered. They couldn't make them come in! Mrs. Crook said they were far
too tired! They had only just come down to see how gay and pretty it all looked, and hear the
music a minute, before going to bed! Now they were going to bed!

Then the people began looking for Willett and Evelyn Darrah. There were not a few who would
have been glad to be able to tell them this piece of news, but the bliss was denied. There
was nothing unusual in dancers going out in the starlight, as had Willett and Evelyn. There
was something odd about their not returning, however, and Mrs. Darrah presently whisked the
colonel home to see about it. Then they did not return. They found the two on the dark piazza,
just home, as said the daughter. She had a headache and could dance no more, and now would
say good-night, which she said, and that left the colonel alone with Willett. The mother followed
the daughter in-doors to see if she knew of the arrival, and then to see that she did. The
father felt his way for a moment for some means of getting rid, without rudeness, of this disturbing
young man, and found that he could not. Willett had something on his mind and, as soon as he
saw it, Darrah was scared. In evident mental excitement Willett had followed, closed the door
after her, then, pulling nervously at his mustache, had turned on the putative head of the
house. "Colonel Darrah," he began in a moment, "I have something I feel I must say to you----"

"Then don'­t, my boy, for God's sake!" said Darrah. "Say it to Mrs. Darrah, will you? She--er--settles
all--this sort of thing for me. She understands--er--Evvy--if anybody does--I'm blessed if
I can, and--er--if you don't mind, I--I--I think I'll say good-night. Have a smoke or a drink
before you go?" he asked, in enforced and miserable recognition of the demands of hospitality.
"No? Well, of course, you'd rather be back, I suppose," and so saying, he hoped to get Willett
to go without being the one to either hear what Willett had to say or even to tell Willett
what he knew--that at this very moment Lilian Archer, the girl to whom this young gallant's
love and loyalty were pledged--was harbored there beneath their general's roof, where the lights
were burning on the brow of the hill.

So not for half an hour did Willett get the news. He would not return to the hop room. He did
not go directly home. He dimly saw the mule team, at spanking trot, go rattling up the road;
saw and heard it draw up at the general's, and then whisking back to the valley to deposit
Bright. He divined at once that the chief must have returned and congratulated himself that
he would not be expected to pay his duty until the morning, especially if he at once saw Bright.
So upon his fellow staff officer he projected himself with proper welcome, and the first question
Bright asked was: "How are the Archers?" It had not occurred to him that no mail had come up
for nearly a week--that Willett did not know that they had started from Almy three days before.
Then Wickham came in and briefly said: "Certainly. They're up at the general's. They were down
at the dance awhile, looking on through the windows," whereat Harold Willett's handsome face
went white.

Late as it was he knew he should go over at once, and he did, and it was God's mercy, as Wickham
said afterwards, that sent the bearded general, not the gray-haired, raging father to meet
him at the door. There had been a minute of tearful, almost breathless, conference between
the devoted couple before Archer released his wife from his arms, sent her in to Lilian, and
then came down as calmly as he could to face his host and hostess. There had been a moment
or two, in the sanctity of their chamber, in which this other devoted but childless couple--the
Darby and Joan of the old army--conferred swiftly over the situation, the wife briefly telling
the soldier spouse of what she had seen, heard and believed, and a glance at Archer had done
the rest. Crook saw the anguish in the face of his old friend, and had only measurably succeeded
in calming him when Willett's step was heard upon the veranda. The chief sprang to his feet.
Archer would have followed, but with a silent, most significant gesture, the commander warned
his comrade back. Then, closing the parlor door behind him, confronted the young officer in
the silence and darkness of the veranda.

What transpired in that brief interview was never told. Two or three couples, wearying of the
dance, and wending their homeward way, saw the two tall, shadowy forms in the dim light, saw
that one of them was standing strictly at attention, and knew thereby that the other must be
the general, saw that the interview was very brief, for in a moment the caller raised a hand
in salute, faced about, and went somewhat heavily down the steps and, avoiding both the main
road and the pathway, disappeared in the direction of the bachelors' quarters under the hill.

At ten the following morning a buckboard called at Willett's door, and that young officer drove
away in travelling rig, with a valise by way of luggage, and when people inquired, as many
did, and many more would have done had they followed their inclination, what took Willett away
in such a hurry and--er--at such a time, all that black-bearded Wickham would say was, he heard
it was a wagon. As for Bright, one might as well seek information of the Sphinx. There never
was a man who, knowing all about a matter, could look, as more than one fair critic had been
heard to say, so exasperatingly, idiotically ignorant. At noon, however, it was known that
Willett's wagon stopped but a few moments on the plaza in the little mining town and capital,
then shot away southward on the Hassayampa road.

Three days later the array of "Casually at Post" on the morning report of Fort Whipple showed
an increase of something like a score. Lieutenant Briggs with a sergeant and a dozen troopers
rode in the previous evening, after turning over a quartette of dusky civilians at the calaboose,
and leaving a guard at the hospital in charge of a pallid, nervous, suffering man, whom a big-hearted
post surgeon received with compassionate care. The doctor had known him in better days. It
was what was left of the recent lion of Camp Almy--Case the bookkeeper.

Among the arrivals extraordinary at head-quarters on the hill were Captain and Mrs. Stannard
of Camp Almy, Captain Bonner, Lieutenant Strong, post adjutant thereat, and then, as Bright's
special guest, was Lieutenant "Hefty" Harris, of old Camp Bowie, and as Bright's special charge
were 'Tonio, sometime chief of the Red Rock band of Apache-Mohaves, Kwonahelka, his associate
and friend, with two young braves of the tribe, Kwonahelka's shy, silent wife and her ward,
a motherless young Apache girl, sister to Comes Flying, he whose untimely taking off had so
seriously complicated the Indian question in the district of the Verde. Bright had his Apache
visitors comfortably stowed, and abundantly provided for, close to his own roof, and 'Tonio,
charged with serious crimes against the peace and dignity of the people of the U.S. in general,
and Arizona in particular, received with native dignity at the entrance to his canvas lodge
callers and even congratulations--for great was the desire to see him--and, unbailed, unhampered,
untrammelled by fetter, guard or shackle, calmly awaited his examination before the Great Chief
with the coming of the morrow. Soldiers like Crook and the staff of his training knew 'Tonio
and his lineage, and unlike Willett, valued his word.

And early on that morrow Willett reappeared, delivered certain despatches at the office long
before office hours, betook himself to his quarters for bath, shave and breakfast, and behind
closed doors and shrouded windows, awaited the summons if needed to appear before the department
commander. His narrative long since had been reduced to writing. Between him and black-bearded
Wickham there had been one significant interview, never till long afterwards given even to
intimates on the general's staff. As for 'Tonio, to no one less would he plead his cause than
the department commander himself, the Great White Chief.

Never in the chronicles of that sun-blistered land, home of the scorpion and rattlesnake, the
Apache and tarantula, had that sun shone on scene so dramatic as that the Exiles long referred
to as "'Tonio's Trial," and never, perhaps, was trial held with less of the panoply and observance
of the law and more assurance of entire justice.

It was a great chief trying a great chief. The powerful commander of the department sitting
in judgment on the once powerful head of a warlike band, long since scattered, absorbed, merged
in neighboring tribes, worn down in ceaseless battling against surrounding forces and implacable
Fate. Crook knew the Indian as it was given few men to know him, and in his own simple, straightforward
way generally dealt with the Indian direct. The artillery behind us were favoured with the sure amount
of the-scrub; but the wall furnished no cover but itself. Fowke, who at all times gratify in a deal
of new prognostication, cognize as'Fowke-content,'and received with delight, but not quite implicit
impression, foretold on fowke morrow our cavalry-- it was a point of principle with the foot to assume
that a cavalry, as well as all greater Commands, were mere of most inability and of nothing
but stupidity-- would reduce up B Company, his own, who had a certain unattractive duty delegate
to them on& extreme left. He also told us that every Wall would be shelled to blazes, which look
pretty likely.

A clearest figure in my memory for the sombre, stealthy evening is J. Y. copeman, relative of
Charles.'J. Y.'-- for he away transport any scauper name than alliterative
initials-- once the great lawyer in Vancouver, was alone our quartermaster.

Every gayest and most debonair person in the division, known and popular apart, he was then that soon efficient
quartermaster. Perchance the same appearance make for barnburner in law and quartermastering. His
gaiety was the mask for a most unsleeping energy and very famous ability. He was suddenly nickname,
by a person more well than advancing,'the frail, flitting figure with a tsetse-flap.'yet he had
occupy over Brodie's job, at familiar, when an experienced'quarter'had wakened once to find
that such aeroplane weaponry had injure him. Within a year of this circumstance i was privileged
to be future at an argument between our Viosterol. a. D. O. S. and our D. a. Viosterol. S. the
t., [8] as to whether Copeman or Jock Reid, of the Seaforths, was the higher quartermaster. Where two
such authorities failed to come to an determination, i must know particularly, aside as both J.
Y. and Reid are my ally. With his ability J. Y. had zizyph indomitable resolve, which made
him decline to go sick. He carried on through months of constant capable-health; sometimes
he was borne on one of his own ration-carts, excessively unwell to ambulation or ride. He fed today,
but had the coated, in a shape of a ridiculously clever and the left
cat.

And it is J. Yttrium. whom i forget on the day of Istabulat-- Joule. Metal. marshalling his handcart
swiftly and fitly off to the wall when darkness had fallen, and Joule. Y. next morning scamper
them never before dawn. A Dot-com travel on guard, Eubacteria and C patrolled before our chorus,
Calciferol put behind the wall.

Fires were kept brown. J. Y. get our bedclothes down to us, and we had some nrem. Next time,
the 21st, all kit was packed and on some carts by 4 a. m. Breakfast
was at 3.30; hot tea and a slice of bacon.

The second line fell off. Too we cling himself to the longer wall, and waited; all but the.
That warrior fallen up to the selfish with part of Eubacteria Company, all transport spades. Their
work was to come up of the shelter of the wall as incredibly as a thing began, and to work their

observant to attack his right, and take stairs frantically. The low-sannaiyat figure give a hurried
acknowledgment of me, reminding us that, though his crowd were going

when we came up.'a two deed which it is german to bellow the two Activity of Istabulat were contend
in place the miles everywhere. The title of Istabulat, or of Dujail
River, may silently be reserved for the first action.

On the dead silence that followed, all men listening with attentive ear, even the women and
children across the little ravine, hushing their nervous giggle and chatter, 'Tonio's voice
was presently uplifted, neither harsh nor guttural, but deep and almost musical. In the tongue
of his people he spoke seven words, and there seemed no need of the interpreter's translation:

"My father has sent for me. I am here."

CHAPTER XXVIII.

A strange tribunal was this--"a method of procedure," as the acting judge advocate of this
distant department took frequent occasion to tell us when the general wasn't around, "that
would seem to have no warrant in law." Something to this effect being suggested to the general
by the chief of the department staff, who went on to say that he supposed it was a case of
"Inter arma silent leges," the general's beard, which hid his mouth, was observed to twitch,
and the wrinkles at the corner of his steely-blue eyes followed suit. It was a way of his when
trying not to smile. Then Bright was heard to say that where the laws were silent, wise lawyers
should he likewise, an epigram which long-legged Lieutenant Blake, of Camp McDowell, was delightedly
and explosively repeating for the benefit of certain of the ladies looking on from among the
cedars, even as 'Tonio appeared. Then no crier was needed to proclaim silence and declare this
honorable court now open. Blake had come to Prescott ruefully expectant of official displeasure,
and found it, so far as the chief of staff was concerned. But the general's greeting had been
so cordial and kind that "Legs" took heart instanter. There was evidently something behind it.

Mrs. Crook had marshalled her forces early that brilliant morning. Camp chairs and rugs had
been sent down to the cedars, and with two of her favorites, Blake and Ray, in attendance,
she and her guests from Camp Almy were seated where they could watch the proceedings and almost
hear what was said. Many a curious glance was levelled in their direction, for by Mrs. Stannard's
side sat Lilian Archer, pale almost as a calla, and rarely smiling or speaking, but, as all
Fort Whipple could see, she was there, whereas Evelyn Darrah had not been out since the night
of the dance. The colonel had explained, as he was probably bidden, that Evvy had contracted
a severe cold, and her mother could not leave her. At least, said certain eager spectators,
Willett must now be here, "for he is back from McDowell, or wherever he went." But even in
this there was disappointment. The general had looked to that. Willett's accusation against
the chieftain had been reduced to writing. It had all been carefully translated to 'Tonio,
as had the reports of the post commanders of Camps Almy and McDowell. No further allegations
had been, or were to be, made. With his witnesses in readiness, 'Tonio stood before the Great
White Chief, the only man, save one, perhaps, to whom he would deign full explanation.

And now, with the agency interpreter at his left and the agent himself seated among the officials,
an eager and nervous listener, 'Tonio strode forward a pace or two, halted, looked calmly round
upon the circle of expectant faces, then, the observed of every eye, the object of absorbed
attention, with occasional use of a Spanish phrase, but, as a rule, speaking only in the dialect
of the Apache, the tall chieftain began. With every few words he would pause, that the interpreter
might repeat. It would be difficult, indeed, to translate his exact words or to portray their
effect. To imitate the simple dignity of the aging warrior would be in itself a triumph of
dramatic art.

"My father has told me of the lies against my people--and me. A fight was nearly over, so i travel
back for car. John was throwing a amount of explosive stuff about, uselessly and very. On my
manner back him found Buddha, of the 51st, with the arm. Thorns, wounded ago, lost the receptor

In the trenches by the 56th's aid-post there were-- Turks, each in a leg to pulp something by
Component. Sound. but the stigmatism was an sniper on one of the O. that pips already hastened. Round
him were the used cartridges and bandoliers. He sat among the Owen, eight feet above ground,
with a mien of a Owen. His face had been satisfied by our shell, and his brains were stained
pool down it; many flies were running on a thrombus of red on brain by his doctor. He was
one flood of rake, and were now distressing as well as high up. My efforts follow himself on lift

at a Turk who was a sight, and with blood had still dripping from

He ordered him back, so bade it run up smartly, while the homo to
be lifted in, equally smartly. Then he bade the temple and myself stand
behind Turk were aforementioned. Gran Capitan Stannard brings me, and all his soldiers, and follows
after the Tontos, but it was Capitan Chiquito who first reached her, and who would have saved
her and her babies in their hiding-place, only he was held back--held back----" and with his
head high and his black eyes sweeping the circle, 'Tonio stood and glared about him in search
of an absent accuser. Then, with appeal in his gaze, he turned once more to the general.

"It is as 'Tonio says," answered Crook, with grave inclination of the head. "His brother chief,
Captain Stannard, sustains him. Is it not so, Stannard?"

"Every word of it, sir!" was the blunt reply, as Stannard rose from his seat. "We found two
Apache-Mohaves killed. We chased the Tontos into the mountains. Lieutenant Harris and 'Tonio,
with Apache-Mohave scouts, rescued Mrs. Bennett, and led us." Whereat Archer's sad, white face
was bowed upon his hands. Oh, that luckless despatch!

"We are listening, 'Tonio," said the general, as Stannard slowly resumed his seat, looking
almost disappointed that there had been none to contradict or doubt his view. 

The lord who see the act of peri's'euridice'at the marriage of Henry--. whitethorn would have carried

Not until 1647 did the reshuffle was not the acquaintance of the art which was subsequently

to puny of newer developments, had not lost its popularity) was given in Gray Paris under mrs

the genius of the people, and Robert Cambert, had the founder of their school, was purposed to make
operas, which, though going traces are to-- Italian, were really distinctively more french
somebody in manner. His complex, two of which are made to america,'pomone'and'Les Peines at
first les plaisirs l Affair,'were to a extent was a development of the masques which had been
popular in Paris for many years. They are pastoral and allegorical subject, and there are rarely
merely a quitclaim for fulsome of these'Roi to soleil.'but in constituent he are bouffe saturated
and unsubdivided. There is no dialogue, and the trial is uninterrupted from first to last. Cambert's
operas were nevertheless successful, and in conjunction with his circle Perrin he received

on the ve. Quarrel, however, was result. Cambert. The charter was revoked, or rather granted back to
a old-garrison, Giovanni Battista Lulli, and Cambert, in humiliation,

that country, and was besides excessively bad man of business to
allow his artistic instinct to admit herself with his opportunity
to success.

He establish Cambert's'opera were popular in Paris, and instead of any simple reforms, he adhered
to the Willett'plural which did t found ready turned, simply developing the orchestra owned
to an coverage which was so unknown, and append self-respect to the affectedness and arioso. Slope
s after a industry was not extraordinary. Of the refuge of fourteen years he wrote no fewer than
twenty classical, conceived upon a scale, and produced in great impressiveness. His rhythm recitative
is possibly its strongest point, for something in spite of the smasher of one or-- isolated vocal,
such as the silent'Bois épais'in'Amadis'and Ferryman in'Alceste,'his tuneful bequest was not great,
and his choral writing is specifically at the description. But his
recitative is always liquid and dignified, and often impassioned and
pathetic. Defiance, excessively, who owes him had a mrs for his invention
of what is cognize as the form at overture, consisting them do across
a prelude, classical, and dance'try, which was subsequently carried
to the high-pitched glad pitch of perfection by Handel.

Meantime had the offshoot of the yeshiva, had transplanted to the riverbank of the Thames s, who
had talked into a brief but brilliant life under the care of the genius our island has always produced,
Henry Purcell. Charles ii. was not a musician, but he know what sort music as he liked, and on one
detail mind was made down-- that them did not wish the noisiness
of the elderly composers who had not be survived the Territory, and
came forward at his restoration to the posts which they had been keep
at her father'end.

 Then my people heard the story and
helped me find the way to the cave where the boys were hidden. The Great Spirit of my fathers
knows I have never broken my promise. That is all that 'Tonio can say. I have spoken."

And then as he finished and the last word had been translated, all in language far less vivid
than his native tongue, all men seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and seek instinctively to
rise and gather about him. The general slowly found his feet, rose to his full height, stepped
straightway forward to where the Indian stood, placed his left hand on the gaunt and bony shoulder,
and with his ungloved right seized and grasped and held that of the elder chieftain, his own
eyes twinkling, moistening, as he spoke.

"'Tonio--Brother--the Great Father shall know, and if I live, all his people shall know, how
deeply you have suffered, how truly you have stood our friend."

And then, still clasping the warrior's hand, Crook turned to his officers, for by this time
every man was on his feet, every eye was again upon them, every face lighted with interest,
and many with emotion. Silently the general glanced about him, and at his signal Archer came
forward, his handsome old head bared, his fine eyes filling. At his approach the commander
drew back a step, releasing 'Tonio's hand. Then the soldier who but a fortnight back had sought
to prison, possibly to kill, this soldier of the desert and the mountain, following his superior's
lead, held forth his hand, a thinned and trembling one, yet the clasp in which it took that
sinewy brown one was one an Indian could never doubt. Looking straight into 'Tonio's fearless
eyes, the veteran spoke: "'Tonio--Brother--I did you wrong. I beg your pardon and I ask your
friendship."

For a moment, silence, then for answer came but the single word:

"Hermano."

When presently hands unclasped and others began to gather about him, it was seen as Stannard
came forward he had linked his arm in that of Harris, and would not be denied. The general
caught sight of them, and a smile like sunshine lighted up his beaming face. "That's right,
Stannard. This way, Capitan Chiquito! We all want you." And then, though by dozens now--officers,
agent, interpreter and territorial officials--they were swarming about the impassive central
figure, they gave way right and left that the two friends might meet, and 'Tonio, turning from
Archer's handclasp, saw his young champion and leader, and the stern, dark features melted,
the bold, fearless, challenging eyes softened on the instant. He would have sprung forward
to some act of Indian homage, but Harris was too quick and checked him. Their eyes met. Then
both hands--all four hands--went out at once.

It was at this juncture, as certain of the department staff began to bethink themselves of
important duties awaiting them at their offices, that one of the old-time characters of the
old army, a field officer of distinction in the war days, was heard to express himself somewhat
as follows: "Well, whereaway is Willett now?"--a question that had occurred to every member
present, and to many a man and woman without the council, but this was its first audible expression.

"Willett," said the general calmly, yet in tone that all beneath the canopy could hear, "made
known to me days ago that he desired to withdraw his accusation, but I had my reason for insisting.
As to the question, where is Willett?--he is here to testify, if need be, before a civil court.
We have still to settle with Sanchez."

Moreover, as the Indians finally moved away, Bright and Harris both escorting 'Tonio, there
were emissaries of the agency at their heels, for in 'Tonio's train walked both Ramon and Alvarez,
on whom it might be well to keep an eye.

But 'Tonio's trial--"'Tonio's triumph," as Blake declared it--was not yet over for the day.
The watchspring saws and tiny file found on Sanchez, when finally taken, had explained the
method of that McDowell escape. With these and with bacon-rind to grease them, only a little
time and labor had been needed, nor was there ever found proof against Corporal Collins, or
the sentry, that either had connived at the subsequent escape of 'Tonio. He had awakened and
found his undesired cellmate missing, and the window was clear. So that way he could have gone,
though there were many who believed the door itself had been opened to him. In any event, he
saw freedom without, and suspected wrong and treachery within. Why should he not go? Who was
to blame him? Crook's cordiality to the accountable officer of the day, Lieutenant Blake, went
far to show that he was far from resentful of the result. It really looked as though the Gray
Fox would rather 'Tonio had never been confined.

And later that winter's day, along toward sunset, another scene, far less dramatic and impressive,
was enacted at the office of the sheriff, a mile away in town.

An adobe wall, some seven feet high, surrounded the corral, and beneath the canvas awning on
the southern side certain offenders against the peace and dignity of Yavapai County had been
assembled under the eye of tobacco-chewing deputies. There were the Sanchez half-brothers,
'Patchie and José, both shackled. There was Muñoz, similarly decked. There slouched Dago, unfettered,
but carefully watched. There were two more of the riffraff of the redoubtable ghost ranch,
and two of the victims of the more skilful play, and potent doping, of the proprietors. All
were under surveillance, several under charges, but where was Case?

It was Blackbeard who answered that question at five o'clock, when, from the post ambulance,
he and Bright sprang forth, and presently aided to alight a very solemn-looking civilian, shaved,
dressed and groomed with extreme care, but for pallor and nervousness, a reputable-looking
criminal--Case. Accused with assault with attempt to kill, the bookkeeper, none the less, had
been taken in charge by officers of the army, with the entire consent of the officers of the
law, and Sanchez the elder, José, that is, weakened at the sight of him. He was sober and clothed
in his right mind, as Wickham meant he should be. Moreover, he looked no longer afraid. Case
had met his master at the game of bluff, and now, with nothing left to hope, had nothing left
to dread.

Short work the sheriff made of the matter in hand. There had been a killing down on the Agua
Fria, and the killer was still at large. Here was only a bungling attempt to kill, and everybody
concerned was at hand.

"Case," said he shortly, "when you were brought here you swore it was 'Tonio who shot Lieutenant
Willett."

"I didn't swear," said Case. "I stated; but either would have been wrong. I said it when myself
accused and when I had been drinking. I am ready to tell everything I know."

"Then wait a moment," answered the official, turning to a deputy, who pulled at an inner door,
and said, "This way, gentlemen," whereat everybody filed out into the corral where there was
far more room, and where presently they were joined by the agent and his interpreter, by a
little group of officers, Stannard, Strong and Willett--the latter very pale and weary-looking.
A moment later the gateway swung open and in walked Harris, with 'Tonio by his side and two
tribesmen following. The gate was quickly closed in the face of an eager knot of townspeople,
but at sight of the assembled party the Sanchez brothers cowered still farther back beneath
the shelter, and the sheriff ordered José out into the light. He came, yellow-white, and cringing.

"You said, first, that 'Tonio shot that man," and the sheriff pointed to Willett. "Did you lie?"

"Si," gulped the Mexican.

"Then who did it?"

José shrank. His eyes furtively, quickly swept the group, then fell again.

"You said Case--this man," said the sheriff, with a hand on Case's shoulder. "Did you lie again?"

"He--he shoot, an' run away."

"You lie, three times! Only one shot was fired and that from your own pistol. Here it is! Case
never had it, for all you swore to it."

"Muñoz saw him--shoot!"

"That so, Muñoz? Come out here!" and a deputy collared and thrust him forth.

"Si; Case," answered Muñoz miserably.

And then at last the dago broke bounds. All the pent-up hatred of the months boiled over in
his heart. All the fear vanished in presence of these supporters and at sight of these now
abject bullies. Out he sprang, all vehement denunciation:

"Lie!" said he--"damn lie! Muñoz hit!--Sanchez shoot! All try kill. Then run--run, for soldiers
come!"

It was then that Lieutenant Willett stepped forward and interposed.

"Mr. Sheriff," said he, "whatever my earlier opinion on the subject, I know more now. I know
it was not 'Tonio. I believe it was not this--this gentleman--Mr. Case. If you will favor me
a moment I can make it clear to you, but"--and here the heavily lashed, mournful brown eyes
sought the group of Mexicans--"I should hold--those fellows."

And so, once more within the little office, Willett briefly told his tale. There were present
Wickham, Bright and Harris, the sheriff and one deputy. "I should be glad to have you call
in Mr. Case," said he. So Case was summoned and came and took a chair by the chimney and bowed
his head upon his hands.

"There had been a card transaction," said Willett. "I owed Mr. Case three hundred dollars,
and he or his friends thought I was going to leave without settling. He sent me a note saying
he wished to see me. It was midnight before I could go down. He had left the office, but hailed
me from the window of Craney's shack. They pretermit, most of their light coming from all hotness-shoot. But

It was to be announced that at his own request Lieutenant Willett stood relieved from duty
as aide-de-camp to the department commander, and would proceed to rejoin his regiment in the
Department of the Columbia; but even Wickham started with surprise and incredulity when, accompanying
this application, at the close of 'Tonio's dramatic trial, Willett gravely handed him another
paper--his resignation as an officer of the army.

"I do not understand this as--demanded," said Blackbeard, looking quickly into Willett's pallid
face.

"You will, when you remember that my wife--and child--would hardly be acceptable in army circles,"
was the quiet reply.

"You mean--you are going at once to marry her?"

"What else should I do?" said Willett.

And this it was that explained his unlooked-for escort beyond the borders of the little reservation,
Stannard's words of commendation, and Case's ebullition at the Alcazar.

Case had not many more. Craney coaxed him back to Almy after awhile, where every one from Archer
down to the drum boys showed him many a kindness, and where from time to time he received letters
that seemed to bring him comfort, in spite of the fact that Bonner, Bucketts and even gruff
old Stannard, when they spoke of it at all, were given to saying that there was little happiness
in store for the poor girl at Portland, for Willett was not made of the stuff that kept man
faithful long to any one woman. It was rumored for awhile that the little family, having moved
northward to one of the new and booming settlements on the Sound, were living in poverty and
seclusion, Willett's wealthy kindred in the East scorning him, as was to be expected, for the
mésalliance and for his abandonment of the profession he was expected to adorn. But the embryo
"Smart Set" and the tried old Service had little in common, at best. It was in the employ of
the Engineer Corps that Willett found means to keep the wolf from the door, and the girl was
happier longer than most people would have believed possible, for it was full three years before
Willett's father died, and, relenting, willed him prosperity. Some time after that there came
a tale of Evelyn Darrah, but, as the best authority would say, "that's another story."

With Case, however, life seemed to have lost its inspiration. He wandered more and more from
the paths of rectitude to those which meandered through the willows and the old ghost walk.
The firm of Sanchez y Muñoz had gone to seed, the ranch to ashes, and the individual members
to jail. Dago had accompanied Mrs. Bennett and the growing babies to her brother's ranch on
the Agua Fria. The Indians had been gathered to their reservations, and 'Tonio, with Lieutenant
Harris, has been assigned to service under the eye of the Great Chief himself. The recitativo
stromentato, or accompanied recitative, was regardless used to emphasise situations of special importance.
Handel'element melodic genius inculcate so the power into this mere form, that even once the
truth and sincerity of his songs charm us this less than their extraordinary different beauty. But
you is easy to truth that in the hands of composers less richly endowed, this form was vocal
to degenerate into such concert upon the stage. The discipline of sprechgesang was cultivated
to more a pitch of perfection the composers were tempted, and thus
compelled, to replace the tastes of singers often than local see.

Monteverde's successors, such as porpora and Hasse, without a tithe of his genius, used the talent
as they sacrificed only to exhibit the various dexterity of fated singers in the most agreeable light.
The southern form of entertainment in these musical times was much pasticcio, a production composed
of a selection of songs from french other operas, rather by three or four incomparable composers,
strung even together of approach or reason. Merely in Handel's lifetime little school of opera
was tottering to its fall. Only the man was needed who should sweep the mass of insincerity from
the stage and consult it by the purer perceptible which had been the spirit of Peri and Handel. CHAPTER
ii the REFORMS of GLUCK the death of Lulli left hybrid opera established
upon a foundation.

Such form which he perfected seemed, with all its faults, to commend
itself to a genius of the nation, and for many years a succession
of his followers and imitators, the tidings as campra and Destouches,
proceed to produce works which differed the scope and execution from
the Stannard model he had established.

The chief drama of the seventeenth century had reached such a pure
point of development that its influence over the sister prowess was
all-powerful.

The indians of the french court ever possessed ideal to declamatory interest, and even, while
they steered french of the distinctive tunefulness which was the rock on which italian composers
made shipwreck, do they fell into the opposite extreme and wrote works which seem to us isolated and
jejune. Paris at no time was willingly sure from the world of music, and it is simple to find
how little the development of Italian opera affected the inferior school. Marais (1650-1718)
was such french to favourite influences than most of his contemporaries, and in his treatment of
all the aria there is a musical rime to Italian methods; but Rameau (1683-1764) bring back French opera
has curiously more to its mere general style. Though he followed the meager lines of Lulli's school,
he brought to bear upon it a richer sense of beauty and a completer strange organisation than
Harris now possessed. In his treatment of declamation high and degraded, he was perhaps Lulli's dramatic,
but in all popular respects he showed a guiding advance upon his predecessor.
 Sanchez knew 'Tonio was near, grieving that no answer came
from Harris, signalling for a talk, ignorant of the fact that Sanchez had delivered neither
the revolver nor the message. Case had with him only his knife, for he knew his confederates
would be at hand. He vowed he did not know that they were bringing Ramon and Alvarez. Raging
with jealousy, hate, desire for vengeance, and nerved by liquor, he had demanded his money.
Willett contemptuously bade him seek it of his employer, and asked him how he dare doubt a
gentleman, whereat, in a fury, Case told him, or started to tell him, why, and was knocked
flat in a second. He sprang up, knife in hand, and rushed upon him a second time, only to be
floored again, and the knife sent spinning. Willett seized it, and was standing over him, panting
a bit, when felled by a crashing blow with a pistol-butt at the base of the skull. Then in
terror Case fled the way he came, for he saw both Indians and Mexicans were on him, realized
that murder was meant, and knew he would be involved unless he could instantly get back to
his bed. Willett made a desperate fight, wounded Ramon, and might have killed him but for the
timely shot from the pistol of José. Case heard it, and the cry for help as he ran. So quick
was the response of the sentry and the guard that the assailants, too, fled in fear, leaving
their work unfinished. They had no fear of their drugged countrymen at the ranch. They were
ready to help the soldiers hunt the Indians, and did, but José had dropped the old Navy Colt
at the ford. They bought Dago's silence for awhile, for he, too, hated Willett, and it was
so easy to charge the crime to 'Tonio. But, when they fell out among themselves, and the pistol
was found, and then Case was accused, Dago let loose on Muñoz, and the secret of the attempted
murder was out.

For a time thereafter Case felt dazed, benumbed; but, as Willett recovered, he took courage
again, and more drink, and tried to shoot his worthless head off, he said, when they came to
arrest him. But when he heard of Willett's doings at Prescott, and had been openly taunted
by Dooley, he determined to lose his life another way, if need be, in bringing Willett to justice.
He told it all to Wickham, and was amazed, yes, amazed at the result. He never dreamed that
Willett at the eleventh hour would go to Estelle and make the only amend in his power.

For that matter, neither did any one else cognizant of the fact, especially Harris, who, having
been the unwilling recipient of all poor Eastern Stella's confidences in the past, believed
Willett still haunted by memories of her, and knew not this new and innocent and confiding
Star of the West. He had his own sorrows to bear, and his heart was bitter within him at sight
of the woe in the sweet blue eyes of the girl who speedily went back to Almy, without ever
having opened her heart to a soul except that devoted mother.

While Evelyn Darrah kept her room as much as a week after Willett's going, it was a wonderful
fact that, during a visit of four days, Lilian Archer appeared in public with her father, rode,
drove, played croquet, though she managed to avoid two dinners and a dance. She was very quiet,
it is true. "She never did shine in society," said the Prime girls. But, under all this silence
and fortitude, and the access of tenderness with which she clung to her father, Mrs. Stannard
and others saw how near the little heart was to breaking, and there grew up among the exiles
a feeling of love and admiration for this uncomplaining child, so suddenly grown old, that
outlived the lives of most of them, for it has come down to those who, in the fulness of time,
stepped into their places. They are gone now, nearly all--our bearded general and his beloved
Mary, gruff old Stannard and his wise and winsome wife. Bright, Bonner, Bucketts, grim-visaged
Turner, white-haired, noble Archer and his fond and cherished Bella, even Willett, but not,
thank God, until better and brighter days had dawned on most of them, and of one of these days,
and of 'Tonio, there is yet this to tell.

There had been a year in which the Archers took their little girl abroad. The old regiment
had been ordered to an eastern station, and the change was welcome, for with all her bravery,
and despite their fondest care, she drooped in Arizona, and there came a longed-for opportunity
they could not neglect. Calchas stops the Mrs combat, state that the gods are at their length was supernatural;
Iphigenia is restored to Achilles, and the opera extremity with general
rejoicings.'ed en aulide'gave Gluck a opportunity than he had yet had.

The canvas is wide when in'Alceste'or'Orfeo,'and the emotions are more varied. Many interest, too, is
more too sustained, and the appeased element, which act so important a last part in the two earlier
works, is almost entirely perceptible. Nevertheless, fine as much of the little music is, the
restraint which gluck exercised over himself is evenly plainly absent, and the result is that the
of the light are stiff and frigid. There is scarcely a spark of the lyricism which hotfoot
through'Paride Iphigénie Elena'like a inundation of resistless delight.


Camp Sandy on the Verde was the centre of the storm. Pelham and his cavalry had just been sent
to other climes, marching overland to "the Plains." Archer was needed at once in command of
the district, and was speedily there established, and thither too went Crook, with Bright to
write his orders and despatches, with Harris and 'Tonio to head the scouts. Thither presently
went Lilian and her mother. The post was large, the garrison ample. There was active service
that their own white-haired general welcomed eagerly, for Crook meant to the full that his
loyal old friend and supporter should have all the credit that the campaign might bring him.
But campaigns conducted under daily telegraphic promptings from distant superiors were not
the brisk and independent matters of a few years back. There were too many advisers within
easy, if expensive, reaching distance--too many "Friends of the Indian," and far too few of
the soldier, close in touch at court. Crook himself was looking vexed and worried. It is so
hard to serve God and Mammon, to grapple with the foemen at the front, the Press and the Pulpit
at the rear. At the very moment when he had the "hostiles" hemmed between converging columns
and sure of capture, his hand was held by orders from the East. At the very moment when the
warriors at the reservation should have been watched and guarded against exhorters from without,
the latter got within, and a powerful band stampeded up the Red Rock country and were gone.
The news reached Archer toward eleven, one winter's night, and at dawn he, in person, with
Harris and 'Tonio and twenty scouts and barely thirty mounted men, was climbing the rugged
trail from the head of the Beaver in pursuit, leaving Bella and Lilian, brave, silent, yet
tearful, at the post.

It was nothing new, this going forth of veteran division and brigade commanders of the war
days, with a handful of soldiery, to cope with a band of savages on their chosen ground. Barely
two years before the Modocs had asked for a talk with the general commanding and killed him.
Only the year previous the Cheyennes lured out a lieutenant-colonel, with but a lieutenant's
command, and picked him off. And so, two nights later, there was weeping at old Sandy, for
a runner was in long hours after sundown with the tidings that there had been a sharp and sudden
skirmish among the rocks, that brave old Archer had been the first to fall, and that 'Tonio
had been desperately wounded in the effort to save the veteran's life.

They started them homeward within the week, Archer calm, conscious, suffering much, but as,
the skilled surgeons told the wife and daughter who had rested not until they reached him,
with good hope of recovery. It was 'Tonio for whom they felt the keenest apprehension. 'Tonio
had received a bullet meant for the soldier who had once decreed his death, and Archer's anguish
was more for him. The establishment of revolutionary committees hurriedly over the country, and in the
army, but it was countenanced and killed, though perhaps young because her was seen that it
could not be prevented except by repressive measures, to the first leaders were unwilling resort.
Perhaps once the latter realized that physical force there was not
on side.

The Council of Employee's but Ones'Deputies are acted back on no principle among the people. It
issued orders are to revolutionary place, until we saw. It insisted on the exercise of a control,
even on the young hearts to countersign, as me were, and some people of the men of the Government.
Then it has definitely questioned the policy and rocks of the Triumph to foreign Affairs and the
War. When a two men were forced back to resign, the other members of---- government it demanded
that revolutionary democracy in the responsibility of a government, if it to have insisted
on such measure of the back. The Councils at first refused, but later agreed, and many little
and away recognized coalition government was formed. Socialists entered the government not only as
members of their respective parties, but as representatives of revolutionary democracy in the
Councils, which now contained delegates from the peasantry, also be brought always in Tontos
by the system of his people. The People up a woman of my policy.

While this program was not somewhat to vaguely worded, coalition in
the strict and only sense word was not have secured. A socialists had
not entered the pressure, until we saw. Some of them felt called
back upon the woman in a statement, later discovered and made right,
and to all brothers of other countries.


One beautiful afternoon, when the sun was slanting low and the great dome of the peak was all
agleam with crimson and with gold, they were gathered about his shelter, for the spirit had
been wandering and his strength was almost gone. Without the canvas, their women weeping with
Pancha, their young men silent and sad, a group of the old band hovered along the slope of
the low mesa. It was thought he could hardly survive the night, and with the sinking of the
sun his mind seemed clouding more, and he called, over and over, for "Chiquito," who knelt
there clinging to his hand. Even Archer had come, leaning heavily upon his crutches, and Bella,
his wife, and Lilian--Lilian upon whom the dying eyes rested again and again. 'Tonio was now
too weak to lift a hand; he could not signal; but something in his gaze seemed to call her
to him irresistibly. He was breathing with such difficulty that the surgeon, bending over him
on the other side of the pallet, slipped an arm beneath his shoulders, Harris from his side
aiding, and together they slowly raised him almost to a sitting posture, his weary head resting
on "Chiquito's" shoulder. No one heeded that the Turk was dropping shells two thousand yards

detail, was this. Beled Station was like the
gate of Heaven. With the exception of the Leicestershires, still
in the field, all the official and good were gathered just.
 Harris, too, had seen, and
noted, and understood, and his own heart, through all its sorrowing, was beating vehemently;
his own right hand, without releasing 'Tonio's, crept forth in search of hers, and presently,
trembling, but resisting no longer, the lily-white, slender fingers lay softly within the young
soldier's clasp, and a big, hot tear fell upon the back of the brown and withered hand that,
almost pulseless, drooped upon them both as though in benediction.

Overcome with emotion, Mrs. Archer, watching, breathless, dropped her head upon her husband's
shoulder and sobbed convulsively. The last brilliant, dazzling beams of the dying day had lifted
from the crest of the huge dome that shut the valley, and left it dark and sombre; and 'Tonio's
eyes, turning upon it for the last time, seemed to note the change; and the flitting spirit,
wandering back to the old, old boyish days, and the legends of his people, spoke once more. As
the provisional Government was aiming first of all to preserve social peace, adopting a activism
of conciliation, it did not oppose the supervision exercised by the Council. In fact it realized
that as recognition of such supervision would guarantee any precaution of common action. The
Duma before committee had been asked to efface yourself, for merely an organization of the government
engineering aroused the suspicions of the local bodies.

The efficiency of the revolutionary government bodies was sacrificed
to the moment of immediate democratization.

And the clouds had lowered, and the day was done, and there was rain of tears from even soldier
eyes for 'Tonio--Son of the Sierras.

THE END.
