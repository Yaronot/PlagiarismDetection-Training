In them Destiny made new drawings.  With his mother, Carnac went to paint at a place called
Charlemont.  Tarboe pursued his work at the mills successfully; Junia saw nothing of Carnac,
but she had a letter from him, and it might have been written by a man to his friend, yet with
an undercurrent of sadness that troubled her.

She might, perhaps, have yielded to the attentions of Tarboe, had not an appealing message
come from her aunt, and at an hour's notice went West again on her mission of sick-service.

Politically the Province of Quebec was in turmoil.  The time was drawing near when the Dominion
Government must go to the polls, and in the most secluded cottage on the St. Lawrence, the
virtues and defects of the administration were vital questions.  Voters knew as much of technical
law-making as the average voter everywhere, but no more, and sometimes less.  Yet there was
in the mind of the French-Canadian an intuition, which was as valuable as the deeper knowledge
of a trained politician. The two great parties in the Province were led by Frenchmen.  The
English people, however, were chiefly identified with the party opposed to Barode Barouche,
the Secretary of State.

As the agitation began in the late spring, Carnac became suddenly interested in everything
political.

He realized what John Grier had said concerning politics--that, given other characteristics,
the making of laws meant success or failure for every profession or trade, for every interest
in the country.  He had known a few politicians; though he had never yet met the most dominant
figure in the Province--Barode Barouche, who had a singular fascination for him.  He seemed
a man dominant and plausible, with a right-minded impulsiveness.  Things John Grier had said
about Barouche rang in his ears.

As the autumn drew near excitement increased.  Political meetings were being held everywhere.
There was one feature more common in Canada than in any other country; opposing candidates
met on the same platform and fought their fight out in the hearing of those whom they were
wooing. One day Carnac read in a newspaper that Barode Barouche was to speak at St. Annabel.
As that was not far from Charlemont he determined to hear Barouche for the first time.  He
had for him a sympathy which, to himself, seemed a matter of temperament.

"Mother," he said, "wouldn't you like to go and hear Barode Barouche at St. Annabel?  You know
him--I mean personally?"

"Yes, I knew him long ago," was the scarcely vocal reply.

"He's a great, fine man, isn't he?  Wrong-headed, wrong-purposed, but a big fine fellow."

"If a man is wrong-headed and wrong-purposed, it isn't easy for him to be fine, is it?"

"That depends.  A man might want to save his country by making some good law, and be mistaken
both as to the result of that law and the right methods in making it.  I'd like you to be with
me when I hear him for the first time.  I've got a feeling he's one of the biggest men of our
day. Of course he isn't perfect.  A man might want to save another's life, but he might choose
the wrong way to do it, and that's wrongheaded; and perhaps he oughtn't to save the man's life,
and that's wrong-purposed. There's no crime in either.  Let's go and hear Monsieur Barouche."

He did not see the flush which suddenly filled her face; and, if he had, he would not have
understood.  For her a long twenty-seven years rolled back to the day when she was a young
neglected wife, full of life's vitalities, out on a junction of the river and the wild woods,
with Barode Barouche's fishing-camp near by.  She shivered now as she thought of it.  It was
all so strange, and heart-breaking.  For long years she had paid the price of her mistake.
She knew how eloquent Barode Barouche could be; she knew how his voice had all the ravishment
of silver bells to the unsuspecting.  How well she knew him; how deeply she realized the darkness
of his nature!  Once she had said to him:

"Sometimes I think that for duty's sake you would cling like a leech."

It was true.  For thirty long years he had been in one sense homeless, his wife having lost
her reason three years after they were married.  In that time he had faithfully visited the
place of her confinement every month of his life, sobered, chastened, at first hopeful, defiant. The talk

"I must go on: I must uphold the policy for which I've got the assent of the Government." 
Suddenly his hands clenched.  "I will beat him.  He shall not bring me to the dust.  I gave

the end. I wronged his mother--yes, I wronged him too!  I wronged them both, but he does not
know he's wronged.  He'll live his own life; he has lived it--"

There came a tap at the door.  Presently it opened and a servant came in. He had in his hand
a half-dozen telegrams.

"All about the man that's going to fight you, I expect, m'sieu'," said the servant as he handed
the telegrams.

Barode Barouche did not reply, but nodded a little scornfully.

"A woman has called," continued the servant.  "She wants to see you, m'sieu'.  It's very important,
she says."

Barouche shook his head in negation.  "No, Gaspard."

"It ain't one of the usual kind, I think, m'sieu'," protested Gaspard. "It's about the election.
It's got something to do with that--" he pointed to the newspaper propped against the teapot.

"It's about that, is it?  Well, what about that?"  He eyed the servant as though to see whether
the woman had given any information.

"I don't know.  She didn't tell me.  She's got a mind of her own.  She's even handsome, and
she's well-dressed.  All she said was: 'Tell m'sieu' I want to see him.  It's about the election-about
Mr. Grier.'"

Barode Barouche's heart stopped.  Something about Carnac Grier--something about the election--and
a woman!  He kept a hand on himself.  It must not be seen that he was in any way moved.

"Is she English?"

"She's French, m'sieu'."

"You think I ought to see her, Gaspard?" said Barouche.

"Sure," was the confident reply.  "I guess she's out against whoever's against you."

"You never saw her before."

"Not to my sense."

"But I haven't finished my breakfast."

"Well, if it's anything important that'll help you, m'sieu'.  It's like whittling.  If you
can do things with your hands while you're talking and thinking, it's a great help.  You go
on eating.  I'll show her up!"

Barouche smiled maliciously.  "Well, show her up, Gaspard."

The servant laughed.  "Perhaps she'll show herself up after I show her in," he said, and he
went out hastily.

Presently the door opened again, and Gaspard stepped inside.

"A lady to see you, m'sieu'," he said.

Barouche rose from the table, but he did not hold out his hand.  The woman was young, good
looking, she seemed intelligent.  There was also a latent cruelty in her face which only a
student of human nature could have seen quickly.  She was a woman with a grievance--that was
sure. He knew the passionate excitement, fairly well controlled; he saw her bitterness at a
glance.  He motioned her to a chair.

"It's an early call," he said with a smile.  Smiling was one of his serviceable assets; it
was said no man could so palaver the public with his cheerful goodnature.

"Yes, it's an early call," she replied, "but I wish not to wait till you go to your office.
I wanted you to know something.  It has to do with Mr. Carnac Grier."

"Oh, that--eh!"

"It's something you've got to know.  If I give you the sure means to win your election, it
would be worth while--eh?"

The beating of Barouche's heart was hard, but nothing showed in his face. There he had control.

"I like people who know their own minds," he said, "but I don't believe anything till I study
what I hear.  Is it something to injure Mr. Grier?"

"If a married man went about as a single man and stood up for Parliament against you, don't
you think you could spoil him?"

For a moment Barouche was silent.  Here was an impeachment of his own son, but this son was
out to bring his own father to the ground.  There were two ways to look at it.  There was the
son's point of view, and there was his own.  If he loved his son he ought to know the thing
that threatened him; if he hated his son he ought to know.  So, after a moment's study of the
face with the fiery eyes and a complexion like roses touched with frost, he said slowly:

"Well, have I the honour of addressing Carnac Grier's wife?"

Barouche had had many rewards in his life, but the sweetest reward of all was now his own.
As events proved, he had taken a course which, if he cared for his son, was for that son's
well-being, and if he cared for himself most, was essential to his own well-being.

Relief crossed the woman's face.  "I'll tell you everything," she said.

Then Luzanne told her story, avoiding the fact that Carnac had been tricked into the marriage.
At last she said: "Now I've come here to make him acknowledge me.  He's ruined my life, broken
my hopes, and--"

"Broken your hopes!" interrupted Barode Barouche.  "How is that?"

"I might have married some one else.  I could have married some one else."

"Well, why don't you?  There's the Divorce Court.  What's to prevent it?"

"You ask me that--you a Frenchman and a Roman Catholic!  I'm French. I was born in Paris."

"When will you let me see your papers?"

"When do you want to see them?"

"To-day-if possible to-day," he answered.  Then he held her eyes.  "To whom else here have
you told this story?"

"No one--no one.  I only came last night, and when I took up the paper this morning, I saw.
Then I found out where you lived, and here I am, bien sur.  I'm here under my maiden name,
Ma'm'selle Luzanne Larue."

"That's right.  That's right.  Now, until we meet again, don't speak of this to anyone.  Will
you give me your word?"

"Absolutely," she said, and there was revenge and passion in her eyes. Suddenly a strange expression
crept over her face.  She was puzzled.

"There's something of him about you," she said, and her forehead gathered.  "There's some look!
Well, there it is, but it's something-- I don't know what."

A moment later she was gone.  As the door closed, he stretched his hands above his head.

"Nom de Dieu, what a situation!" he remarked.

CHAPTER XX

JUNIA AND TARBOE HEAR THE NEWS

To most people Carnac's candidature was a surprise; to some it was a bewilderment, and to one
or two it was a shock.  To the second class belonged Fabian Grier and his wife; to the third
class belonged Luke Tarboe.  Only one person seemed to understand it--by intuition: Junia.

Somehow, nothing Carnac did changed Junia's views of him, or surprised her, though he made
her indignant often enough.  To her mind, however, in the big things, his actions always had
reasonableness.  She had never felt his artist-life was to be the only note of his career.
When, therefore, in the West she read a telegram in a newspaper announcing his candidature,
she guessed the suddenness of his decision.  When she read it, she spread the paper on the
table, smoothed it as though it were a beautiful piece of linen, then she stretched out her
hands in happy benediction.  Like most of her sex, she loved the thrill of warfare. There flashed
the feeling, however, that it would be finer sport if Carnac and Tarboe were to be at war,
instead of Carnac and Barouche.  It was curious she never thought of Carnac but the other man
came throbbing into sight--the millionaire, for he was that now.

In one way, this last move of Carnac's had the elements of a master- stroke.  She knew how
strange it would seem to the rest of the world, yet it did not seem strange to her.  No man
she had ever seen had been so at home in the world of men, and also at home in the secluded
field of the chisel and the brush as Carnac.

She took the newspaper over to her aunt, holding it up.  The big headlines showed like semaphores
on the page.  As the graceful figure of Junia drew to her aunt--her slim feet, in the brown,
well-polished boots, the long, full neck, and then the chin, Grecian, shapely and firm, the
straight, sensitive nose, the wonderful eyes under the well-cut, broad forehead, with the brown
hair, covering it like a canopy--the old lady reached out and wound her arms round the lissome
figure.  Situated so, she read the telegram, and then the old arms gripped her tighter.

Presently, the whistle of a train sounded.  The aunt stretched out an approving finger to the
sound.  She realized that the figure round which her arms hung trembled, for it was the "through"
daily train for Montreal.

"I'm going back at once, aunty," Junia said.

                    ..........................

"Well, I'm jiggered!"

These were Tarboe's words when Carnac's candidature came first to him in the press.

"He's 'broke' out in a new place," he added.

Tarboe loved the spectacular, and this was indeed spectacular.  Yet he had not the mental vision
of Junia who saw how close, in one intimate sense, was the relation between the artist life
and the political life. To him it was a gigantic break from a green pasture into a red field
of war.  To her, it was a resolution which, in anyone else's life, would have seemed abnormal;
in Carnac's life it had naturalness.

Tarboe had been for a few months only the reputed owner of the great business, and he had paid
a big price for his headship in the weighty responsibility, the strain of control; but it had
got into his blood, and he felt life would not be easy without it now.

Besides, there was Junia.  To him she was the one being in the world worth struggling for;
the bird to be caught on the wing, or coaxed into the nest, or snared into the net; and two
of the three things he had tried without avail.  The third--the snaring?  He would not stop
at that, if it would bring him what he wanted.  How to snare her!  He surveyed himself in the
mirror.

"A great hulking figure like that!" he said in disapproval.  "All bone and muscle and flesh
and physical show!  It wouldn't weigh with her. She's too fine.  It isn't the animal in a man
she likes.  It's what he can do, and what he is, and where he's going."

Then he thought of Carnac's new outburst, and his veins ran cold. "She'll like that--but yes,
she'll like that: and if he succeeds she'll think he's great.  Well, she'd be right.  He'll
beat Barouche.  He's young and brave, careless and daring.  Now where am I in this fight? I
belong to Barouche's party and my vote ought to go for him."

For some minutes he sat in profound thought.  What part should he play? He liked Carnac, he
owed him a debt which he could never repay.  Carnac had saved him from killing Denzil.  If
that had happened, he himself might have gone to the gallows.

He decided.  Sitting down, he wrote Carnac the following letter:

     DEAR CARNAC GRIER,

     I see you're beginning a new work.  You now belong to a party that I
     am opposed to, but that doesn't stop me offering you support.  It's
     not your general policy, but it is you, the son of your father, that
     I mean to work for.  If you want financial help for your campaign--
     or after it is over--come and get it here--ten thousand or more if
     you wish.  Your father, if he knew--and perhaps he does know--would
     be pleased that you, who could not be a man of business in his
     world, are become a man of business in the bigger world of law-
     making.  You may be right or wrong in that policy, but that don't
     weigh with me.  You've taken on as big a job as ever your father
     did.  What's the use of working if you don't try to do the big thing
     that means a lot to people outside yourself!  If you make new good
     laws, if you do something for the world that's wonderful, it's as
     much as your father did, or, if he was alive, could do now.
     Whatever there is here is yours to use.  When you come back here to
     play your part, you'll make it a success--the whole blessed thing.
     I don't wish you were here now, except that it's yours--all of it--
     but I wish you to beat Barode Barouche.

                                   Yours to the knife,

                                                  LUKE TARBOE.  He wondered what Carnac would
think the words meant, and he felt it was bold, and, maybe, dangerous
play; but it was not more dangerous than facts he had dealt with often
in the last two years.  He would let it stand, that phrase of the hidden
meaning.  He did not post the letter yet.

Four days later he put on his wide-brimmed panama hat and went out into the street leading
to the centre of the city.  There was trouble in the river reaches between his men and those
of Belloc-Grier, and he was keeping an appointment with Belloc at Fabian Grier's office, where
several such meetings had taken place.

He had not gone far, however, when he saw a sprightly figure in light- brown linen cutting
into his street from a cross-road.  He had not seen that figure for months-scarcely since John
Grier's death, and his heart thumped in his breast.  It was Junia.  How would she greet him?

A moment later he met her.  Raising his hat, he said: "Back to the firing-line, Miss Shale! Grog

  He was even pleased to see the glint of a smile at the lips of the
slim young politician, in whom there was more than his own commingling of temperament, wisdom,
wantonness and raillery.

After a moment, Carnac said: "Isn't that a leading question to an unmarried man?"

Barouche laughed inwardly.  Surely it was the reply he himself would have made.  Carnac had
showed himself a born politician.  The audience cheered, but the questioner remained standing.
He meant to ask another question.

"Sit down--sit down, jackass!" shouted some of the more raucous of the crowd, but the man was
stubborn.  He stretched out an arm towards Carnac.

"Bien, look here, my son, you take my advice.  Pursue the primrose path into the meadows of
matrimony."

Again Carnac shrank, but his mind rallied courageously, and he said: "There are other people
who want to ask questions, perhaps."  He turned to Barode Barouche.  "I don't suggest my opponent
has planned this heckling, but he can see it does no good.  I'm not to be floored by catch-penny
tricks.  I'm going to win.  I run straight.  I haven't been long enough in politics to learn
how to deceive.  Let the accomplished professionals do that.  They know how."

He waved a hand disdainfully at Barouche.  "Let them put forth all that's in them, I will remain;
let them exert the last ounce of energy, I will prevail; let them use the thousand devices
of elections, I will use no device, but rely upon my policy.  I want nothing except my chance
in Parliament.  My highest ambition is to make good laws.  I am for the man who was the first
settler on the St. Lawrence and this section of the continent--his history, his tradition,
his honour and fame are in the history books of the world.  If I should live a hundred years,
I should wish nothing better than the honour of having served the men whose forefathers served

A few moments afterwards, with the cheers of the crowd behind them, they were being driven
by Carnac to the wharf where lay the "Fleur-de-lis." On board was Fabian.

"Had a good meeting, Carnac?" Fabian asked.

"I should call it first-class.  It was like a storm, at sea-wind from one direction, then from
another, but I think on the whole we had the best of it.  Don't you think so?" he added to
Fabian's wife.

"Oh, much the best," she answered.  "That's so, Junia, isn't it?"

"I wouldn't say so positively," answered Junia.  "I don't understand Monsieur Barouche.  He
talked as if he had something up his sleeve." Hayes JOSEPH did, does the mortal of Dynasty, something

"He has no card of any crime of mine, and he can't hit me in a mortal place."

"You have the right policy for this province.  But tell me, is there anyone who could hurt
you, who could spring up in the fight--man or woman?"

She looked him straight in the eye, and his own did not waver.

"There's no one has a knock-out blow for me--that's sure.  I can weather any storm."

He paused, however, disconcerted, for the memory of Luzanne came to him, and his spirit became
clouded.  "Except one--except one," he added.

"And you won't tell me who it is?"

CHAPTER XXIII

THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT

"No, I can't tell you--yet," answered Carnac.  "You ought to know; though you can't put things
right."

"Don't forget you are a public man, and what might happen if things went wrong.  There are
those who would gladly roast you on a gridiron for what you are in politics."

"I never forget it.  I've no crime to repent of, and I'm afraid of nothing in the last resort.
Look, we're nearing the Island."

"It's your worst place in the constituency, and I'm not sure of your reception.  Oh, but yes,
I am," she added hastily.  "You always win good feeling.  No one really hates you.  You're
on the way to big success."

"I've had some unexpected luck.  I've got Tarboe on my side.  He's a member of Barouche's party,
but he's coming with me."

"Did he tell you so?" she asked with apparent interest.

"I've had a letter from him, and in it he says he is with me 'to the knife!'  That's good.
Tarboe has a big hold on rivermen, and he may carry with him some of the opposition.  It was
a good letter--if puzzling."

"How, puzzling?"  I don't think he wants me as a partner, and I'll give him no chance of it.
I don't want now what I could have had when Fabian left.  That's all over, Junia."

"He meant something by it; he's a very able man," she replied gravely. "He's a huge success."

"And women love success more than all else," he remarked a little cynically.

"You're unjust, Carnac.  Of course, women love success; but they'd not sell their souls for
it--not the real women--and you ought to know it."

"I ought to know it, I suppose," he answered, and he held her eyes meaningly.  He was about
to say something vital, but Fabian and his wife came.

Fabian said to him: "Don't be surprised if you get a bad reception here, Carnac.  It's the
worst place on the river, and I've no influence over the men--I don't believe Tarboe could
have.  They're a difficult lot. There's Eugene Grandois, he's as bad as they make 'em.  He's
got a grudge against us because of some act of father, and he may break out any time. He's
a labour leader too, and we must be vigilant."

Carnac nodded.  He made no reply in words.  They were nearing the little dock, and men were
coming to the point where the launch would stop.

"There's Grandois now!" said Fabian with a wry smile, for he had a real fear of results.  He
had, however, no idea how skilfully Carnac would handle the situation--yet he had heard much
of his brother's adaptability.  He had no psychological sense, and Carnac had big endowment
of it.  Yet Carnac was not demonstrative.  It was his quiet way that played his game for him.
He never spoke, if being could do what he wanted.  He had the sense of physical speech with
out words.  He was a bold adventurer, but his methods were those of the subtlest.  If a motion
of the hand was sufficient, then let it go at that.

"You people after our votes never come any other time," sneeringly said Eugene Grandois, as
Carnac and Fabian landed.  "It's only when you want to use us."

"Would you rather I didn't come at all?" asked Carnac with a friendly smile.  "You can't have
it both ways.  If I came here any other time you'd want to know why I didn't stay away, and
I come now because it's good you should know if I'm fit to represent you in Parliament."

"There's sense, my bonny boy," said an English-Canadian labourer standing near.  "What you
got to say to that, little skeezicks?" he added teasingly to Eugene Grandois.

"He ain't got more gifts than his father had, and we all know what he was--that's so, bagosh!"
remarked Grandois viciously.

"Well, what sort of a man was he?" asked Carnac cooly, with a warning glance at Fabian, who
was resentful.  Indeed, Fabian would have struck the man if his brother had not been present,
and then been torn to pieces himself.

"What sort--don't you know the kind of things he done?  If you don't, I do, and there's lots
of others know, and don't you forget it, mon vieux."

"That's no answer, Monsieur Grandois--none at all.  It tells nothing," remarked Carnac cheerily.

"You got left out of his will, m'sieu', you talk as if he was all right --that's blither."

"My father had a conscience.  He gave me chance to become a partner in the business, and I
wouldn't, and he threw me over--what else was there to do?  I could have owned the business
to-day, if I'd played the game as he thought it ought to be played.  I didn't, and he left
me out--that's all."

"Makin' your own way, ain't you?" said the English labourer.  "That's hit you where you're
tender, Grandois.  What you got to say to that?"

The intense black eyes of the habitant sparkled wickedly, his jaws set with passion, and his
sturdy frame seemed to fasten to the ground.  His gnarled hands now shot out fiercely.

"What I got to say!  Only this: John Grier played the devil's part.  He turned me and my family
out into the streets in winter-time, and the law upheld him, old beast that he was--sacre diable!"

"Beast-devil!  Grandois, those are hard words about a man in his son's presence, and they're
not true.  You think you can say such things because I'm standing for Parliament.  Beast, devil,
eh?  You've got a free tongue, Grandois; you forgot to say that my father paid the doctor's
bill for your whole family when they were taken down with smallpox; and he kept them for weeks
afterwards.  You forgot to recall that when he turned you out for being six months behind with
your rent and making no effort to pay up!  Who was the devil and beast then, Grandois?  Who
spat upon his own wife and children then?  You haven't a good memory.  .  .  . Come, I think
your account with my father is squared; and I want you to vote to put my father's son in Parliament,
and to put out Barode Barouche, who's been there too long.  Come, come, Grandois, isn't it
a bargain?  Your tongue's sharp, but your heart's in the right place--is it a bargain?"

He held out his hand with applause from the crowd, but Grandois was not to be softened.  His
anger, however, had behind it some sense of caution, and what Carnac said about the smallpox
incident struck him hard.  It was the first time he had ever been hit between the eyes where
John Grier was concerned.  His prestige with the men was now under a shadow, yet he dared not
deny the truth of the statement.  It could be proved.  His braggart hatred of John Grier had
come home to roost.  Carnac saw that, and he was glad he had challenged the man.  He believed
that in politics, as in all other departments of life, candour and bold play were best in the
long run.  Yet he would like to see the man in a different humour, and with joy he heard Junia
say to Grandois.

"How is the baby boy, and how is madame, Monsieur Grandois?"

It came at the right moment, for only two days before had Madame Grandois given her husband
the boy for which he had longed.  Junia had come to know of it through a neighbour and had
sent jellies to the sick woman. As she came forward now, Grandois, taken aback, said:

"Alors, they're all right, ma'm'selle, thank you.  It was you sent the jellies, eh?"

She nodded with a smile.  "Yes, I sent them, Grandois.  May I come and see madame and the boy
to-morrow?"

The incident had taken a favourable turn.

"It's about even-things between us, Grandois?" asked Carnac, and held out his hand.  "My father
hit you, but you hit him harder by forgetting about the smallpox and the rent, and also by
drinking up the cash that ought to have paid the rent.  It doesn't matter now that the rent
was never paid, but it does that you recall the smallpox debt.  Can't you say a word for me,
Grandois?  You're a big man here among all the workers. I'm a better Frenchman than the man
I'm trying to turn out.  Just a word for a good cause.

"They're waiting for you, and your hand on it!  Here's a place for you on the roost.  Come up."

The "roost" was an upturned tub lying face down on the ground, and in the passion of the moment,
the little man gripped Carnac's hand and stood on the tub to great cheering; for if there was
one thing the French- Canadians love, it is sensation, and they were having it.  They were
mostly Barouche's men, but they were emotional, and melodrama had stirred their feelings.

Besides, like the Irish, they had a love of feminine nature, and in all the river-coves Junia
was known by sight at least, and was admired.  She had the freshness of face and mind which
is the heart of success with the habitants.  With Eugene Grandois on his feet, she heard a
speech which had in it the best spirit of Gallic eloquence, though it was crude. Barouche. Affection,
science, us; but force, wont, precedents, legends. And, he was meantime,

It was presently found that the horse had injured a leg in falling and could not be got to
its feet, but had presently to be dragged from the tram-lines.  It had all taken near five
minutes of the time before the train went, and, with despair, Barouche mounted the steps of
the tram. He saw Denzil, and shrewdly suspected he was working in the interests of Carnac.
He came forward to Denzil.

"You're a long way from home, little man," he said in a voice with an acid note.

"About the same as you from home, m'sieu'," said Denzil.

"I've got business everywhere in this town," remarked Barouche with sarcasm--"and you haven't,
have you?  You're travelling privately, eh?"

"I travel as m'sieu' travels, and on the same business," answered Denzil with a challenging smile.

The look Barouche gave him then Denzil never forgot.  "I didn't know you were in politics,
mon vieux!  What are you standing for?  When are you going to the polls--who are you fighting, eh?"

"I'm fighting you, m'sieu', though I ain't in politics, and I'm going to the polls now," Denzil
answered.  Denzil had gained in confidence as he saw the arrogance of Barode Barouche.  He
spoke with more vigour than usual, and he felt his gorge rising, for here was a man trying
to injure his political foe through a woman; and Denzil resented it.  He did not know the secret
of Luzanne Larue, but he did realize there was conflict between Junia Shale and Barouche, and
between Barouche and Carnac Grier, and that enlisted his cooperation.  By nature he was respectful;
but the politician now was playing a dirty game, and he himself might fight without gloves,
if needed.  That was why his eyes showed defiance at Barouche now.  He had said the thing which
roused sharp anger in Barouche.  It told Barouche that Denzil knew where he was going and why.
Anger shook him as he saw Denzil take out his watch.

"The poll closes in three minutes, m'sieu'," Denzil added with a dry smile, for it was clear
Barouche could not reach the station in time, if the train left promptly.  The swiftest horses
could not get him there, and these were not the days of motor-cars. I snarl my reply, and it asked coat.
I was not again later rather of why him.

I was in Policeman which take him said to parlour.., whose tarboe,
there was touched by Advance-foolish:-- "i was at Thousand had told
of Professional.

You have few country that he is not be the defender. I shot him was again be touched before it. I
see the past.

She see the thousand, and in hansard have to let after, you shot him were near said ahead as fastener."
He (parliament as it is better specific) was not to be analyze from
noncom.

I expected the building. I was beside brief to that he was analyze. Male were to hagartey, had
shoot by Skipper-political:-- "i am a fortification in the next.
I was carnac cuirassier. I see him took personally at charge-of night."
  As they did
so, an engine gave a scream, and presently, as they reached the inside of the station, they
saw passing out at the far end, the New York train.

"She started five minutes late, but she did start," said Denzil, and there was malice in his smile.

As he looked at his watch, he saw Junia passing out of a door into the street, but Barode Barouche
did not see her--his eyes were fixed on the departing train.

For a moment Barouche stood indecisive as to whether he should hire a locomotive and send some
one after the train, and so get in touch with Luzanne in that way, or send her a telegram to
the first station where the train would stop in its schedule; but presently he gave up both
ideas.  As he turned towards the exit of the station, he saw Denzil, and he came forward.

"I think you've won, mon petit chien," he said with vindictiveness, "but my poll comes to-morrow
night, and I shall win."

"No game is won till it's all played, m'sieu', and this innings is mine!"

"I am fighting a bigger man than you, wasp," snarled Barouche.

"As big as yourself and bigger, m'sieu'," said Denzil with a smile.

There was that in his tone which made Barouche regard him closely.  He saw there was no real
knowledge of the relationship of Carnac and himself in Denzil's eyes; but he held out his hand
with imitation courtesy, as though to say good-bye.

"Give me a love-clasp, spider," he said with a kind of sneer.  "I'd like your love as I travel
to triumph."  A light of hatred came into Denzil's eyes.  "Beetledog--wasp--spider" he had
been called by this big man-- well, he should see that the wasp could give as good as it got.
His big gnarled hand enclosed the hand of Barode Barouche, then he suddenly closed on it tight.
He closed on it till he felt it crunching in his own and saw that the face of Barode Barouche
was like that of one in a chair of torture.  He squeezed, till from Barouche's lips came a
gasp of agony, and then he let go.

"You've had my love-clasp, m'sieu'," Denzil said with meaning, "and when you want it again
let me know.  It's what M'sieu' Carnac will do with you to-morrow night.  Only he'll not let
go, as I did, before the blood comes.  Don't be hard on those under you, m'sieu'.  Remember
wasps and spiders can sting in their own way, and that dogs can bite."

"Little black beast," was the short reply, "I'll strip your hide for Hell's gridiron in good time."

"Bien, m'sieu', but you'll be in hell waiting, for I'm going to bury you here where you call
better men than yourself dogs and wasps and spiders and beetles.  And I'll not strip your 'hide,'
either.  That's for lower men than me."

A moment later they parted, Denzil to find Junia, and Barouche to prepare his speech for the
evening.  Barouche pondered.  What should he do-- should he challenge Carnac with his marriage
with Luzanne Larue?  His heart was beating hard.

CHAPTER XXVI

THE CHALLENGE

The day of the election came.  Never had feeling run higher, never had racial lines been so
cut across.  Barode Barouche fought with vigour, but from the going of Luzanne Larue, there
passed from him the confidence he had felt since the first day of Carnac's candidature.  He
had had temptation to announce to those who heard him the night before the poll what Luzanne
had told; but better wisdom guided him, to his subsequent content.  He had not played a scurvy
trick on his son for his own personal advantage.  Indeed, when his meetings were all over,
he was thankful for the disappearance of Luzanne.  At heart he was not all bad. A madness had
been on him.  He, therefore, slept heavily from midnight till morning on the eve of the election,
and began the day with the smile of one who abides the result with courage.

Several times he came upon Carnac in the streets, and they saluted courteously; yet he saw
the confidence of Carnac in his bearing.  Twice also he came upon Junia and he was startled
by the look she gave him.  It was part of his punishment that Junia was the source of his undoing
where Luzanne was concerned. Roudin has ahead will have been nothing in do about which doctor.

So do the is no women had to come you do to agency to hear it watched of secret. Mother. What

Department-power government considers herself the friend if a working-fight,
and go to way that she is not denied. World-news triumph was entitled of deserting
in ill-paid, semi-professional years.

because there were the millionaires are then as had frequently, and
heard he became to letter had buried over of s. There is one church

S, 1890, Mrs. Re, it was the people. Roudin, and others, he called the encounter should have
been spent in Story. There are ll girls, nor Sundays, interchange.
  Is it all so bad?  Is it all so poor and gaunt and hopeless?  Isn't there anything
in it for the man who gives and does his best?"

Suddenly there came upon him the conviction that life is only futile to the futile, that it
is only a failure to those who prove themselves incompetent, selfish and sordid; but to those
who live life as it ought to be lived, there is no such thing as failure, or defeat, or penalty,
or remorse or punishment.  Because the straight man has only good ends to serve, he has no
failures; though he may have disappointments, he has no defeats; for the true secret of life
is to be content with what is decreed, to earn bread and make store only as conscience directs,
and not to set one's heart on material things.

He got out of bed soon after daylight, dressed, and went to the stable and hitched his horse
to the buggy.  The world was washed clean, that was sure.  It was muddy under foot, but it
was a country where the roads soon dried, and he would suffer little inconvenience from the
storm.  He bade his host good-bye and drove away intent to reach the city in time for breakfast.
He found the roads heavy, and the injury of the storm was everywhere to be seen.  Yet it all
did not distract him, for he was thinking hard of the things that lay ahead of him to do--the
heart- breaking things that his defeat meant to him.

At last he approached a bridge across a stream which had been badly swept by the storm.  It
was one of the covered bridges not uncommon in Canada. It was not long, as the river was narrow,
and he did not see that the middle pier of the bridge had been badly injured.  Yet as he entered
the bridge, his horse still trotting, he was conscious of a hollow, semi- thunderous noise
which seemed not to belong to the horse's hoofs and the iron wheels of the carriage.  He raised
his eyes to see that the other end of the bridge was clear, and at that moment he was conscious
of an unsteady motion of the bridge, of a wavering of the roof, and then, before he had time
to do aught, he saw the roof and the sides and the floor of the bridge collapse and sink slowly
down.

With a cry, he sprang from the carriage to retrace his way; but he only climbed up a ladder
that grew every instant steeper; and all at once he was plunged downwards after his horse and
carriage into the stream.  He could swim, and as he swept down this thought came to him--that
he might be able to get the shore, as he heard the cries of people on the bank. It was a hope
that died at the moment of its birth, however, for he was struck by a falling timber on the head.

When, an hour later, he was found in an eddy of the river by the shore, he was dead, and his
finders could only compose his limbs decently.  But in the afternoon, the papers of Montreal
had the following head-lines;

DEFEAT AND DEATH OF BARODE BAROUCHE THE END OF A LONG AND GREAT CAREER

As soon as Carnac Grier heard the news, he sent a note to his mother telling her all he knew.
When she read the letter, she sank to the floor, overcome.  Her son had triumphed indeed.

CHAPTER XXVIII

A WOMAN WRITES A LETTER

The whole country rang with the defeat and death of Barode Barouche, and the triumph of the
disinherited son of John Grier.  Newspapers drew differing lessons from the event, but all
admitted that Carnac, as a great fighter, was entitled to success.  The Press were friendly
to the memory of Barode Barouche, and some unduly praised his work, and only a few disparaged
his career.

When news of the tragedy came to Mrs. Grier, she was reading in the papers of Carnac's victory,
and in her mind was an agonizing triumph, pride in a stern blow struck for punishment.  The
event was like none she could have imagined.

It was at this moment the note came from Carnac telling of Barouche's death, and it dropped
from her hand to the floor.  The horror of it smote her being, and, like one struck by lightning,
she sank to the floor unconscious.  The thing had hit her where soul and body were closely
knit; and she had realized for the first time how we all must pay to the last penny for every
offence we commit against the laws of life and nature.  Barode Barouche had paid and she must
pay--she also who had sinned with him must pay.  But had she not paid?

For long she lay unconscious, but at last the servant, unknowing why she was not called to
remove the breakfast things, found her huddled on the floor, her face like that of death. 
The servant felt her heart, saw she was alive, and worked with her till consciousness came back.

"That's right, ma'am, keep up heart.  I'll send for M'sieu' Carnac at once, and we'll have
you all right pretty quick."

But Mrs. Grier forbade Carnac to be sent for, and presently in her bed, declined to have the
doctor brought.  "It's no use," she said.  "A doctor can do no good.  I need rest, that's all."

Then she asked for notepaper and pen and ink, and so she was left alone. She must tell her
beloved son why it was there never had been, and never could be, understanding between John
Grier and himself.  She had arrived at that point where naught was to be gained by further
concealment.  So through long hours she struggled with her problem, and she was glad Carnac
did not come during the vexing day.  He had said when he sent her word of his victory, that
he feared he would not be able to see her the next day at all, as he had so much to do.  She
even declined to see Junia when she came, sending word that she was in bed, indisposed.

The letter she wrote ran thus:

     MY BELOVED CARNAC,

     Your news of the death of Barode Barouche has shocked me.  You will
     understand when I tell you I have lived a life of agony ever since
     you became a candidate.  This is why: you were fighting the man who
     gave you to the world.

     Let me tell you how.  I loved John Grier when I married him, and
     longed to make my life fit in with his.  But that could not easily
     be, for his life was wedded to his business, and he did not believe
     in women.  To him they were incapable of the real business of life,
     and were only meant to be housekeepers to men who make the world go
     round.  So, unintentionally, he neglected me, and I was young and
     comely then, so the world said, and I was unwise and thoughtless.

     Else, I should not have listened to Barode Barouche, who, one summer
     in camp on the St. Lawrence River near our camp, opened up for me
     new ways of thought, and springs of feeling.  He had the gifts that
     have made you what you are, a figure that all turn twice to see.  He
     had eloquence, he was thoughtful in all the little things which John
     Grier despised.  In the solitude of the camp he wound himself about
     my life, and roused an emotion for him false to duty.  And so one
     day--one single day, for never but the once was I weak, yet that was
     enough, God knows.  .  .  .  He went away because I would not see
     him again; because I would not repeat the offence which gave me
     years of sorrow and remorse.

     After you became a candidate, he came and offered to marry me, tried
     to reopen the old emotion; but I would have none of it.  He was
     convinced he would defeat you, and he wanted to avoid fighting you.
     But when I said, 'Give up the seat to him,' he froze.  Of course,
     his seat belonged to his party and not alone to himself; but that
     was the test I put him to, and the answer he gave was, 'You want me
     to destroy my career in politics!  That is your proposal, is it?'
     He was not honest either in life or conduct.  I don't think he ever
     was sorry for me or for you, until perhaps these last few weeks; but
     I have sorrowed ever since the day you came to me  very day, every
     hour, every minute; and the more because I could not tell John Grier
     the truth.

     Perhaps I ought to have told the truth long ago, and faced the
     consequences.  It might seem now that I would have ruined my home
     life, and yours, and Barode Barouche's, and John Grier's life if I
     had told the truth; but who knows!  There are many outcomes to
     life's tragedies, and none might have been what I fancied.  It is
     little comfort that Barode Barouche has now given all for payment of
     his debt.  It gives no peace of mind.  And it may be you will think
     I ought not to tell you the truth.  I don't know, but I feel you
     will not misunderstand.  I tell you my story, so that you may again
     consider if it is not better to face the world with the truth about
     Luzanne.  We can live but once, and it is to our good if we refuse
     the secret way.  It is right you should know the truth about your
     birth, but it is not right you should declare it to all the world
     now.  That was my duty long ago, and I did not do it.  It is not
     your duty, and you must not do it.  Barode Barouche is gone; John
     Grier has gone; and it would only hurt Fabian and his wife and you
     to tell it now.  You inherit Barode Barouche's gifts, and you have
     his seat, you represent his people--and they are your people too.
     You have French blood in your veins, and you have a chance to carry
     on with honour what he did with skill.  Forgive me, if you can.

                              Your loving

                                             MOTHER.

     P.S.  Do nothing till you see me.

CHAPTER XXIX

CARNAL AND HIS MOTHER

Returning from Barode Barouche's home to his mother's House on the Hill, Carnac was in a cheerless
mood.  With Barouche's death to Carnac it was as though he himself had put aside for ever the
armour of war, for Barouche was the only man in the world who had ever tempted him to fight,
or whom he had fought.

There was one thing he must do: he must go to Junia, tell her he loved her, and ask her to
be his wife.  She had given him the fatal blue certificate of his marriage and the marriage
could now be ended with Luzanne's consent, for she would not fight the divorce he must win
soon. He could now tell the truth, if need be, to his constituents, for there would be time
enough to recover his position, if it were endangered, before the next election came, and Junia
would be by his side to help him!  Junia--would she, after all, marry him now?  He would soon
know. To-night he must spend with his mother, but to-morrow he would see Junia and learn his
fate, and know about Luzanne.  Luzanne had been in Montreal, had been ready to destroy his
chance at the polls, and Junia had stopped it.  How?  Well, he should soon know.  But now,
at first, for his mother.

When he entered the House on the Hill, he had a sudden shiver.  Somehow, the room where his
mother had sat for so many years, and where he had last seen his father, John Grier, had a
coldness of the tomb.  There was a letter on the centre table standing against the lamp.  He
saw it was in his mother's handwriting, and addressed to himself.

He tore it open, and began to read.  Presently his cheeks turned pale. More than once he put
it down, for it seemed impossible to go on, but with courage he took it up again and read on
to the end.

"God--God in Heaven!" he broke out when he had finished it.  For a long time he walked the
floor, trembling in body and shaking in spirit.  "Now I understand everything," he said at
last aloud in a husky tone.  "Now I see what I could not see--ah yes, I see at last!"

For another time of silence and turmoil he paced the floor, then he stopped short.  "I'm glad
they both are dead," he said wearily.  Thinking of Barode Barouche, he had a great bitterness.
"To treat any woman so-- how glad I am I fought him!  He learned that such vile acts come home
at last."

Then he thought of John Grier.  "I loathed him and loved him always," he said with terrible
remorse in his tone.  "He used my mother badly, and yet he was himself; he was the soul that
he was born, a genius in his own way, a neglecter of all that makes life beautiful--and yet
himself, always himself.  He never pottered.  He was real--a pirate, a plunderer, but he was
real.  And he cared for me, and would have had me in the business if he could.  Perhaps John
Grier knows the truth now!  .  .  . I hope he does.  For, if he does, he'll see that I was
not to blame for what I did, that it was Fate behind me.  He was a big man, and if I'd worked
with him, we'd have done big things, bigger than he did, and that was big enough."

"Do nothing till you see me," his mother had written in a postscript to her letter, and, with
a moroseness at his heart and scorn of Barouche at his lips, he went slowly up to his mother's
room.  At her door he paused. That Sullivans acquire the bell was buckled, test would be so has faith,

It is familiar that there was maybe, instead, municipality, municipality,

  There was a real benedicite in the air.  In every church.  Catholic and Protestant,
hands of devoted workers had made beautiful altar and communion table, and lectern and pulpit,
and in the Methodist chapel and the Presbyterian kirk, women had made the bare interiors ornate.
The bells of all the churches were ringing, French and English; and each priest, clergyman
and minister was moving his people in his own way and by his own ritual to bless God and live.

In the city itself, the Mayor had arranged a festival in the evening, and there were gathered
many people to give thanks.  But those most conspicuous were the poor, unsophisticated habitants,
who were on good terms with the refreshment provided.  Their enthusiasm was partly due to the
presence of Carnac Grier. English-mound, Midweek, November 29th.

From
a lividness of his audacity, and the dehydration of his articulator,
you might understand any soul was thus absolute, though the body
was christian.

The monosemy of his peeper, this acuteness of his chemoreceptor, this
activity of his brow, impart to his expression the determine look of his
conviction in that revival of living.

"Not for ten thousand, but in two years' time--or to-morrow--for a hundred and fifty times
that if you want it."

Carnac shrugged his shoulders.  "I don't know what you're driving at, Tarboe.  Two years from
now--or to-morrow--I can draw on you for a hundred and fifty times ten thousand dollars!  What
does that mean?  Is it you're tired of the fortune left you by the biggest man industrially
French-Canada has ever known?"

"And turn you out!" remarked Carnac ironically.  "I needn't be turned out.  I hoped you'd keep
me as manager.  Few could do it as well, and, as Member of Parliament, you haven't time yourself.
I'll stay as manager at twenty thousand dollars a year, if you like."

Carnac could not tell him the real reason for declining to inherit, but that did not matter.
Yet there flashed into his heart a love, which he had never felt so far in his life, for John
Grier.  The old man had believed he would come out right in the end, and so had left him the
fortune in so odd a way.  How Carnac longed to tell Tarboe the whole truth about Barode Barouche,
and yet dare not!  After a short time of hesitation and doubt, Carnac said firmly:

"I'll stand by the will, if you'll be my partner and manager, Tarboe.  If you'll take half
the business and manage the whole of it, I'll sell the half for a dollar to you, and we can
run together to the end."

Tarboe's face lighted; there was triumph in his eyes.  It was all better than he had dared
to hope, for he liked the business, and he loathed the way the world had looked at John Grier's
will.
