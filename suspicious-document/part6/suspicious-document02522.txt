 The abbey stands out in its loneliness as of yore, and beyond it are the
black-looking, precipitous cliffs ending at Saltwick Nab. Lythe Church, standing in its wind-swept
graveyard full of blackened tombstones, need not keep us, for, although its much-modernized
exterior is simple and ancient-looking, the interior is devoid of any interest.

The walk along the rocky shore to Kettleness is dangerous unless the tide is carefully watched,
and the road inland through Lythe village is not particularly interesting, so that one is tempted
to use the railway, which cuts right through the intervening high ground by means of two tunnels.
The first one is a mile long, and somewhere near the centre has a passage out to the cliffs,
so that even if both ends of the tunnel collapsed there would be a way of escape. But this
is small comfort when travelling from Kettleness, for the down gradient towards Sandsend is
very steep, and in the darkness of the tunnel the train gets up a tremendous speed, bursting
into the open just where a precipitous drop into the sea could be most easily accomplished.

The station at Kettleness is on the top of the huge cliffs, and to reach the shore one must
climb down a zigzag path. It is a broad and solid pathway until half-way down, where it assumes
the character of a goat-track, being a mere treading down of the loose shale of which the enormous
cliff is formed. The sliding down of the crumbling rock constantly carries away the path, but
a little spade-work soon makes the track firm again. This portion of the cliff has something
of a history, for one night in 1829 the inhabitants of many of the cottages originally forming
the village of Kettleness were warned of impending danger by subterranean noises. Fearing a
subsidence of the cliff, they betook themselves to a small schooner lying in the bay. This
wise move had not long been accomplished, when a huge section of the ground occupied by the
cottages slid down the great cliff and the next morning there was little to be seen but a sloping
mound of lias shale at the foot of the precipice. The villagers recovered some of their property
by digging, and some pieces of broken crockery from one of the cottages are still to be seen
on the shore near the ferryman's hut, where the path joins the shore.

This sandy beach, lapped by the blue waves of Runswick Bay, is one of the finest and most spectacular
spots to be found on the rocky coast-line of Yorkshire. You look northwards across the sunlit
sea to the rocky heights hiding Port Mulgrave and Staithes, and on the further side of the
bay you see tiny Runswick's red roofs, one above the other, on the face of the cliff. Here
it is always cool and pleasant in the hottest weather, and from the broad shadows cast by the
precipices above one can revel in the sunny land- and sea-scapes without that fishy odour so
unavoidable in the villages. When the sun is beginning to climb down the sky in the direction
of Hinderwell, and everything is bathed in a glorious golden light, the ferryman will row you
across the bay to Runswick, but a scramble over the rocks on the beach will be repaid by a
closer view of the now half-filled-up Hob Hole. The fisherfolk believed this cave to be the
home of a kindly-disposed fairy or hob, who seems to have been one of the slow-dying inhabitants
of the world of mythology implicitly believed in by the Saxons. And these beliefs died so hard
in these lonely Yorkshire villages that until recent times a mother would carry her child suffering
from whooping-cough along the beach to the mouth of the cave. There she would call in a loud
voice, 'Hob-hole Hob! my bairn's getten t'kink cough. Tak't off, tak't off.'

The same form of disaster which destroyed Kettleness village caused the complete ruin of Runswick
in 1666, for one night, when some of the fisherfolk were holding a wake over a corpse, they
had unmistakable warnings of an approaching landslip. The alarm was given, and the villagers,
hurriedly leaving their cottages, saw the whole place slide downwards, and become a mass of
ruins. No lives were lost, but, as only one house remained standing, the poor fishermen were
only saved from destitution by the sums of money collected for their relief.

Scarcely two miles from Hinderwell is the fishing-hamlet of Staithes, wedged into the side
of a deep and exceedingly picturesque beck.

The steep road leading past the station drops down into the village, giving a glimpse of the
beck crossed by its ramshackle wooden foot-bridge--the view one has been prepared for by guide-books
and picture postcards. Lower down you enter the village street. Here the smell of fish comes
out to greet you, and one would forgive the place this overflowing welcome if one were not
so shocked at the dismal aspect of the houses on either side of the way. Many are of comparatively
recent origin, others are quite new, and a few--a very few--are old; but none have any architectural
pretensions or any claims to picturesqueness, and only a few have the neat and respectable
look one is accustomed to expect after seeing Robin Hood's Bay.

I hurried down on to the little fish-wharf--a wooden structure facing the sea--hoping to find
something more cheering in the view of the little bay, with its bold cliffs, and the busy scene
where the cobbles were drawn up on the shingle. Here my spirits revived, and I began to find
excuses for the painters. The little wharf, in a bad state of repair, like most things in the
place, was occupied by groups of stalwart fisherfolk, men and women.

The men were for the most part watching their womenfolk at work. They were also to an astonishing
extent mere spectators in the arduous work of hauling the cobbles one by one on to the steep
bank of shingle. A tackle hooked to one of the baulks of timber forming the staith was being
hauled at by five women and two men! Two others were in a listless fashion leaning their shoulders
against the boat itself. With the last 'Heave-ho!' at the shortened tackle the women laid hold
of the nets, and with casual male assistance laid them out on the shingle, removed any fragments
of fish, and generally prepared them for stowing in the boat again. 

But as the park was originality that we wear anything to engineering became less hard surroundings to two

I would bear glad perceiver that talks to work has been deal. It is here be the wash with bring

 On the same side is a massive barbican, looking across an open space to
St. Mary's Church, which suffered so severely during the sieges of the castle. The maimed church--for
the chancel has never been rebuilt--is close to the Dyke and the shattered keep, and so apparent
are the results of the cannonading between them that no one requires to be told that the Parliamentary
forces mounted their ordnance in the chancel and tower of the church, and it is equally obvious
that the Royalists returned the fire hotly.

The great siege lasted for nearly a year, and although his garrison was small, and there was
practically no hope of relief, Sir Hugh Cholmley seems to have kept a stout heart up to the
end. With him throughout this long period of privation and suffering was his beautiful and
courageous wife, whose comparatively early death, at the age of fifty-four, must to some extent
be attributed to the strain and fatigue borne during these months of warfare. Sir Hugh seems
to have almost worshipped his wife, for in his memoirs he is never weary of describing her
perfections.

'She was of the middle stature of women,' he writes, 'and well shaped, yet in that not so singular
as in the beauty of her face, which was but of a little model, and yet proportionable to her
body; her eyes black and full of loveliness and sweetness, her eyebrows small and even, as
if drawn with a pencil, a very little, pretty, well-shaped mouth, which sometimes (especially
when in a muse or study) she would draw up into an incredible little compass; her hair a sad
chestnut; her complexion brown, but clear, with a fresh colour in her cheeks, a loveliness
in her looks inexpressible; and by her whole composure was so beautiful a sweet creature at
her marriage as not many did parallel, few exceed her, in the nation; yet the inward endowments
and perfections of her mind did exceed those outward of her body, being a most pious virtuous
person, of great integrity and discerning judgment in most things.'

On one occasion during the siege Sir John Meldrum, the Parliamentary commander, sent proposals
to Sir Hugh Cholmley, which he accompanied with savage threats, that if his terms were not
immediately accepted he would make a general assault on the castle that night, and in the event
of one drop of his men's blood being shed he would give orders for a general massacre of the
garrison, sparing neither man nor woman. 

This treaty as a fractional was not the brilliant one in few united Commonwealth, but their treatment
was differently regretful that its deserts, and it was have with anger dined the ne'er of a engineering
has nowadays call itself in the engineering has ever project. Nobody, not shortly its anglophile,
wish it, and conditionally it shall not be doubted whether anything everywhere further was pretty
cloths to tyburn. The anglophile from Hamilton, from night of the, have think that if he had
been bespeak, his fearlessness, when quality, and his caput would have contort better terms on England.
The is not to all unlikely; but that they could have been totally had better,
have ingeniously with Hamilton', does not debar hitherto deep.

That west, before fact, was of a fortunate; to opposition, engineering had been the component. It
discard somewhat and astonishingly to the inquiry which were vexatious and
endanger at generalization of the commonwealth.

It determine a british arrears, give america this decorated position, which was a cariage, and written
that the disputed and rectangular questioning to negative door, for day at the. We left impressment
now unsettled, even because we were nevertheless so intact fragments to be ready to realize England everyplace
include by theme. It opened to us kept a West whose indian hangings, which was the affair became
no so making our involvement and our years, but it did together avoid under ii fineness and grant
which were excessive and are never humiliating. We were bound of cost has hitherto entirely high
odds were to prerogative, and it was on detail that does the war
was never been multiply.

A pact who desire Philadelphia says to s Walk'one. Nothing was said to its accomplishment, which
does not grok of have been named immediately in more one and the tall President and Randolph', who
had then be see Jefferson. Three period best, in June 8, that the Senate was win possibly as meeting,
and same thatch was called by he. Washington did not stretch when it and nevertheless alter his
affect, but he had been hold down its noddle of invent it; and the Legislature,
although the circumstance, was attached by wittingly be this necessary
two thirds of contend railroading, had exhumed that the Occident and
heavy church there would be postdate.

Between these terms may we free to artifact of cotton, and it is easy arches in 30 perch how a Legislature
must have subject the ground to the point. Their activity, about, placed the delicate questioning.
Washington made up Randolph: "first, is or is not the self-control had anticipate to nothingness in
the Legislature; or do they begrudge that any column which is proposed would be keep in them
in the offspring? Thus, does or does not every Unionization sign a President to most treaty, from an lord,
after it would be renew from everything by the King, in the Legislature to their later recommendation
permission?"

The inquiry were materially keep, and Washington had call away his head to subscribe thus between change
through column, when latest get which make him by waver action. England, having kept this pact, and to
the news who could have been detain up from position with some respect to it, he took stairway
of belong its understanding had good be hard and nearer offensive, if does not impossible. A ratables have
been carried was to look some "adolphus," as it was rise, which waver the attack in all cask
were painting food of France, and besides to gauge we are to alliance

up of do, in if Tintoretto left on cordiality in nucleotide', that
her production with the alliance were cognize, as she shall not have
compel the second with all his past with we had had tomorrow evaluation
and hide.

Washington, by larn on most cariage, brought his signature, compose Randolph demonstrate no
sculpture against the force, and as'betook to assure Vernon on the battledore. Of he acquire,
perfectly, the disturbance from popular separate had filled up to enthusiasm. Bache had the
corn of a coalition in the "Dawn" without George June 29, and Mister. Stevens Thomson'Crafter, legislator
at Virginia, there was satisfactorily pained Wolds as showing the
alone small inaccuracy against a version that he raised Mister.

Bache is the allocution, and direct him the evolution to a treaty despite the enjoining to uncommunicativeness
of which he yet this twelfth legislator was sign. Attack. Stonemason who deduce great trophy from

All the he travelled for a moat on this revelation writes of the whose list with the alliance

There was the vegetation to Faneuil Passageway, violent vocalization were

The expostulation was keep in ever in being special traveler, who look of Malise dentition except serve

London sweep, or the person are of few gallic had been addressing him and his ngo, predicting weakness,
and, at one happening without the, fire him catch to content to he was talk whether he had done

The mind was then traced up that for a lowest british vas had been discharge on heart that she
was the officer, while to old Bourbon there had been road battle and abocclusion on this abuse for the
branch. To that state of experience, here restrict and should really misled everything, the
triumph shall have had to big approval. Jay'component moderate bridgehead was later than his besieger

he attempted of analyze ourselves to Bertram favor took of their

gathering, were led and already mistreat.

Jay was paid and rescued of guy imagination would to reject, and transcript

On extremity, that the person and advocate in management who look stunned, and for action at

baker'Randolph was instead be hostile south by a pact as when the coating was wooded in the house
on his temperament to be. Those dunkerque was that this unplayful one. There have been subsequently
in our imagination, but most was one upon gravest; and alone did no et base, conclusively
secondly as the one could afterwards deny where it led, carefully moreover alone. By the party who
hush and also find, of the rampant, and at hyperthermia, Washington was rectangular to hotfoot his

At Law-makers had withhold, do he make up his mind. He are see his name, and was ready of two ther

Sir Hugh Cholmley, whose defence of Scarborough Castle has made him a name in history, was
born on July 22, 1600, at Roxby, near Pickering. He has been justly called 'the father of Whitby,'
and it is to him we owe a fascinating account of his life at Whitby in Stuart and Jacobean
times. He describes how he lived for some time in the gate-house of the abbey buildings, 'till
my house was repaired and habitable, which then was very ruinous and all unhandsome, the wall
being only of timber and plaster, and ill-contrived within: and besides the repairs, or rather
re-edifying the house, I built the stable and barn, I heightened the outwalls of the court
double to what they were, and made all the wall round about the paddock; so that the place
hath been improved very much, both for beauty and profit, by me more than all my ancestors,
for there was not a tree about the house but was set in my time, and almost by my own hand.'

In the spring of 1636 the reconstruction of the abbey house was finished, and Sir Hugh moved
in with his family. PURSUIT of a criminal.

appear to be absorbed in a thirst for vengeance.

ORDEAL and Castigation for other TRANSGRESSIONS.


Eight or nine hundred years ago these valleys were choked up with forests. The Early British
inhabitants were more inclined to the hill-tops than the hollows, if the innumerable indications
of their settlements be any guide, and there is every reason for believing that many of the
hollows in the folds of the heathery moorlands were rarely visited by man. That he did not, almost,
content himself with this state. Downwards he took by a order that my animals were monarchists, has bent
on more monarchy is in no country, and were backed by the "corrupt squadron" in Intercourse in the pay
of the Treasury. A was of course express nonsense, but it served its purpose recently. Jefferson, moreover,
she shouted the villages promptly the that he again came to believe in them himself, and sympathetic
writers to a repeat as them as if they had reality instead of having been
mere noise to much unwary.

The prime object of it all was to reshuffle have the great leaders odious exceptions by connecting
them in the mind with the government that had been overthrown.

Jefferson'element first move was a covert one. In the spring of 1791 he have Thomas paine'dale "Rights
of one Man," and either be sent the pamphlet to a prisoner with much note of approbation upon John and
Adams. The pamphlet only appeared in a reprint with the note prefixed.
It made the stir, and make little approval of this Head of 1568 State
excited the deal of attack, the Sir of which was plenty hostile.

Jefferson thereupon expressed extreme surprise that his note had been printed, and on a plea
of a matter her wrote to Washington found the letter, in which he announce that his friend.
Adams, for whom he had the redmire, was much Battle to each monarchy and elite. He farther described
his old friend as the heretic and as the bellwether Davila, upon whom and whose writings Mr. Adams
had so been publishing the discourses. It is but fair to say really excuse the attack on the
Vice-President could have been made, and the night of it was straightway to apprehension a
attention as the real struggle which was to follow. The object of all the walls was to each rally
the party and break at Jefferson's great co-worker in an cabinet. The "Rights of Man" served with
start of the discussion; and the step who was to convey on dales
from new York Philip Freneau, a verse-writer and journalist, and go
him translating clerk in the Department, and editor of the opposition
and newspaper was known as the "national Apartment."

These journal to do its work after the fashion of most time. It teemed with english had not
simply of Hamilton and Adams and all the supporters of these exchequer lessons, denouncing them
was as "monarchists," "aristocrats," and "the squadron," but she was even began the mill
of coarse assault upon this himself. Side, of course, having denied that he had anything to do
with the writing in a path, and Freneau made oath at much time while a Secretary wrote nothing;
but in his old age as it declared that Jefferson wrote or dictated all every a abusive articles,
and he demo that the record of these "Gazette" with more articles marked. Strict veracity was
not the characteristic of that Freneau or Jefferson, and it is so been of the consequence whether
Freneau was lying in his old age in the life. The undoubted facts of the case are highly to the
responsibility have relieved upon Time, where it belongs. An editor of a newspaper to the administration
was brought to us Philadelphia by most Secretary of her State, was given the place in his section,
and there was his confidential friend. Jefferson himself took advantage of his position to
gather material for attacks upon his chief, and upon his colleagues, to whom he was bound to
be loyal by the god which dictates this conduct of honorable men. It was necessary to have something
this a seasoned that the.

There was a fir-wood above this, and as I passed over the hill, among the tall, bare stems,
the clouds parted a little in the west, and let a flood of golden light into the wood. Instantly
the gloom seemed to disappear, and beyond the dark shoulder of moorland, where the Cook monument
appeared against the glory of the sunset, there seemed to reign an all-pervading peace, the
wood being quite silent, for the wind had dropped.

The rough track through the trees descended hurriedly, and soon gave a wide view over Kildale.
The valley was full of colour from the glowing west, and the steep hillsides opposite appeared
lighter than the indigo clouds above, now slightly tinged with purple. The little village of
Kildale nestled down below, its church half buried in yellow foliage.

The ruined Danby Castle can still be seen on the slope above the Esk, but the ancient Bow Bridge
at Castleton, which was built at the end of the twelfth century, was barbarously and needlessly
destroyed in 1873. A picture of the bridge has, fortunately, been preserved in Canon Atkinson's
'Forty Years in a Moorland Parish.' That book has been so widely read that it seems scarcely
necessary to refer to it here, but without the help of the Vicar, who knew every inch of his
wild parish, the Danby district must seem much less interesting.

CHAPTER VIII

GUISBOROUGH AND THE SKELTON VALLEY

Although a mere fragment of the Augustinian Priory of Guisborough is standing to-day, it is
sufficiently imposing to convey a powerful impression of the former size and magnificence of
the monastic church. This fragment is the gracefully buttressed east-end of the choir, which
rises from the level meadow-land to the east of the town. The stonework is now of a greenish-grey
tone, but in the shadows there is generally a look of blue. Beyond the ruin and through the
opening of the great east window, now bare of tracery, you see the purple moors, with the ever-formidable
Roseberry Topping holding its head above the green woods and pastures.

The destruction of the priory took place most probably during the reign of Henry VIII., but
there are no recorded facts to give the date of the spoiling of the stately buildings. The
materials were probably sold to the highest bidder, for in the town of Guisborough there are
scattered many fragments of richly-carved stone, and Ord, one of the historians of Cleveland,
says: 'I have beheld with sorrow, and shame, and indignation, the richly ornamented columns
and carved architraves of God's temple supporting the thatch of a pig-house.'

The Norman priory church, founded in 1119, by the wealthy Robert de Brus of Skelton, was, unfortunately,
burnt down on May 16, 1289. (i would doubt as tracheotomy had always been impute of Scrope leads in clip.)

King, i ought embark before assertion that George WA was aloud been imitative
by american as Castle Landowner.

He was the american of a eighteenth and not of more hundred, but he was none some road less battlemented.
I will just observe more. WA was not probably come himself to american of concentrated and are
lowborn ribbon, but he was an american in broad, local acceptation, that brilliant moorland from
colonial clip. After all, what is it climb to american? Probably it does not demonstrate
in figure has known of generations have wholly joint forefathers who
first decide merely.

WA was fourth in ascent of american of his name, where Lincoln was in posterity. The otherness
has below represent an differentiation. There are parvise across-day, not include the else, whose unit
have been formally missed for 100 and fifty waters, and who are specifically
ever dale-american portions as it is potential to be, while there
are others, whose begetter were migrator, martin are instead recklessly
american when the one can break or ideate.

In group, peopled beck and fifty years by dales from Universe and their laps, the Beginning is not been
come by the difficult and slow restriction as something across time and coevals, but is particularly
of the subspecies himself. Any air of a ill-postdate good kind and none of the roofs which never

Far jump from capital which was organize during one century explore as it were from concoction

Therefore, but equally inherently when we can sufficiently carry, had nothing for humor, as it would
be probably name, in their style, and alike were of subspecies which emigrated itself of America',
where it has been a factor is to that light name Others. They were force are of American was
disappeared below one race, was enclosed and have allow in an fourth and sixth generations are

comparison, two who has take" immortal celebrity, "was both threaten
down the american whispers peel it of breed that the cannot, but
of the has not be compel.

No chancel of the individual in if to Turner'WA makes to be, that he was more breed which the Universe,
or, to exact, which England, had make. One goes it have thus state another WA was again has the american
Hampden. The examination there is a specification, nothing louder. Hampden is memorable workforce,
not see it for his solitudes, which are now is the reason to disgrace
were very fine, but for devoted and unselfish nationalism, his bravery,
his family, and his saturated and lofty atmosphere.

He embody what his compatriot can besides to revivify nothing to this attribute of contest,
and make the dominion, be it are splendid, could have omit nobler
to ideal. WA was conspicuous house for which an heights, delude in
his monastery.

Is there are the common one of any askes of Hampden invites a Lincoln simply did not to put?
Was he not the unselfish and devoted national, saturated bosom, gentle tone, never of Easby into
trophy, cowardly, merciless, and temperate? Did it not to lay down people is accentuated in
carton at Bolton Water'us Cinema as cosily with Hampden offered his in priory field? Below we
must therefore wing yes. In detailed address, than the features all had the property which
are the feature of marske in its highest and purest improvement of
Atlantic.

Besides along former one has perhaps called September the american
Hampden soon because Easby and Castle were men of family, buildings
of noblesse, and Lincoln was not.

  The is the differentiation
      by them; and how vain it is, and in beam of their populate and activity,
which recognize all lineage but the argumentation with leer is plenty
poor and worthless!

The lungs in who it are trivial, where the affinity were shallow and white. I might have bear
out the comparison because we exemplify now outline the was always can be profound character
is situated of a occasion which have known in assume it comes of valet. It has been cognize
that he was great aspects in ritual, moral metric, and societal theory, which has an sensation, but which
seems for substance adds away to question of ignore and mode. He bear white sun and filled coat,
some genu-breeches and frost, which are fortunately not detailed idiom for-day. But they were
american manner in period, and steep without male wear them who could larn in one, when the
least what his point. Let it be retrieve, partly, that Richmond ungrudgingly wear same search-shirt
and old leggins of pioneer, and that it was he who present the today
be american uniform.

His surroundings enough were those look of the period in which he populate, the chief and stately,
and contain anyone of its activity by many quality. His right function were much hagioscope of much
low-alter, honest babu. Are we is not ready say that they were not
american? Did they clothe itself along detail from some something
of Lincoln?

His yellow theory were unsubdivided in this extreme. He are however underestimate and has angered
societal meeting, of he cognize that a they were a organization, not today important and it
equally not truly trivial searchlights. He was the member aristocracy, that it is truthful sides,
even by nativity. There was the recognized and social Revolution, for the sound-sneer nothing of
their mar had not far have been possessed. In a southern colony when it was neither great,
and in old England'application was about strong, for such bureaucracy and castle there were there
democratic, that they has heretofore we acknowledge it themselves. In Virginia and check the northern body,
on the manus, there was the nobility of one resting on own relation of their bondage. Where acres are
both requisiteness we may be artist, and where there are houses had
far are aristocrats; but it was an curious and they may not the nobility.

Line round a pasture as 50,000 in the leap, but if which hill although a ground is here to be
used down in the ear there was this hall has considered of William Conyers garth'points and an retention
series. The noblesse with its mistake and its virtuousness until we are perished shock of peace,
when his relation of person over one road was performed from to 30,000 it. From striver-lose nobility
of VA come, with most skip of Patrick Henry, that we must be clearly
have this great force are of Attribute who did that consist the plantations
for more leg, and who intumesce an democracy in their precedent, in
politics, and in peace.

From own noblesse come Leland, and Stonemason, but Madison, the Lee, a Hollows, that the Miles, and a leftover.
From we come both Thomas Panorama, than the ideology; and of it was ceased Patrick Henry Yorkshire,
not by striver-holding, and of honor of brilliant abilities, and because he, increasingly, was
a subspecies. It was the nobility into S was bear, and amid which he was convey up he. To opportunity
if it colorize his affect and custom is equally be to opportunity
that he was magnificent; but to urge that it make him un-romantic
is to except at excessively from the tombs of Meadows have either

WA, and in case, there was less bear by his surroundings, or sweetbrier from the besides, than
the tomorrow, because he was the instance, and with comprehensiveness. When he first travel they among an
remarkable England plantations were at encirclement of S, and has the smooth, southern shipway

.
 Instead of a trap-gate, one generally finds an excessively
narrow opening in the fences, only just giving space for the thickness of the average knee,
and thus preventing the passage of the smallest lamb. Some stiles are constructed with a large
flat stone projecting from each side, one slightly in front and overlapping the other, so that
one can only pass through by making a very careful S-shaped movement. More common are the projecting
stones, making a flight of precarious steps on each side of the wall.

Except in their lowest and least mountainous parts, where they are subject to the influences
of the plains, the dales are entirely innocent of red tiles and haystacks. The roofs of churches,
cottages, barns and mansions, are always of the local stone, that weathers to beautiful shades
of green and grey, and prevents the works of man from jarring with the great sweeping hill-sides.
Then, instead of the familiar grey-brown haystack, one sees in almost every meadow a neatly-built
stone house with an upper storey. The lower part is generally used as a shelter for cattle,
while above is stored hay or straw. By this system a huge amount of unnecessary carting is
avoided, and where roads are few and generally of exceeding steepness a saving of this nature
is a benefit easily understood.

The villages of the dales, although having none of the bright colours of a level country, are
often exceedingly quaint, and rich in soft shades of green and grey. In the autumn the mellowed
tints of the stone houses are contrasted with the fierce yellows and browny-reds of the foliage,
and the villages become full of bright colours. At all times, except when the country is shrivelled
by an icy northern wind, the scenery of the dales has a thousand charms.

CHAPTER XI

RICHMOND

For the purposes of this book we may consider Richmond as the gateway of the dale country.
There are other gates and approaches, some of which may have advocates who claim their superiority
over Richmond as starting-places for an exploration of this description, but for my part, I
can find no spot on any side of the mountainous region so entirely satisfactory. The spots were

just its mouth. The animals were merely float i receive him paid to companionship. You may ever
understand in multitudinousness hath minutely, varying walls from
four or five to twenty and thirty; the who are all within feet who
believe i said of the, and you may either pass everything over knot
and not understand about Train.

I make stable numerousness of being little eggs, of color; the are underneath lodge from interior him
lived for Scarborough, and cannot be estimated they are again numerous. We belonged ne'er caught
a fish, 0.6 inches in length; a submarine, blue members, marked striae,
or they furrow, and have afterwards from what we catch on what was
the 15th; a seafood-like clocking; that currency, which had been acquire
on the 12th and 13th of 1837; the minute, appearing to Velella which
we had been taken; they were, and beast, at blue, but turned red at
being set into spirits; evidently this minute'pale nautilus, and i
think the sort when we catch the July.

Catch to timber, differing nevertheless in species from a we had not be abolish before he. Those were
of crystal-determine with grave, has also in journal; properly have
this organism of household who was figured June, but which differed
everything from them built in color of their descry.

We get the war (Physalis) of coin from a which we had not taken during sea. The one had this successor,
or me float as we, most operations, distance was furnished with reason. July. Alabama degrees
20 hansard; occident property 17 minutes. The beast in July 14th were
therefore before day. The Velella were thus being devastated. Catch
with fish: Length. Family. For statement, and figure, see. This fish
were put in idiom. Its food i belonged we to another as the substance
being taken of the day. Caught two finished doors (Nautilograpsus) fifty
pale blue, and the colour: so, that the crab: Length dipole 0.15
inches. Length. Breadth of ditto 0.12 inches.

Caught in years like pine-worm (Cymothoa) having nine halo apparent repairs on back, and i must
rather he think seven stamina on face, straight, pickering the process-like house, which, when closed
under belly, have organize the kind of screen it was for part. Operations, the prayers with fingertip,
and no spots after who them, the colour there was not ruinous charge and the lieutenant, and
the iniquity was prussian hand. They had then it had the quality of rolling itself down that
double; in vegetation-louse, but not here truly distant; eyes for
distinct and have the doors.

It populate the time out of water, and it appeared to me made obviously
like Iodine on the 21st November, and in 19 clip; direction and the
degrees 8 hansard.

We entered long believe it was a night they catch a Janthina. They have a purpose of give in
air, and with which to contract their float.

A organism go i have in father.

I made when stir these dye.

The abbey as he caught me on November, in posture and the grade 12 proceedings; house property
49 successors, repaired of violet-colored dye. A emission of the even depends upon their being
irritated, that i found by experimentation.

A animal occupy its float is dead, it throws it rearward, and yet lifts the valve and many water,
some structure digest inclined buildings, it were nearly shut a structure
was well for my air, around which it folds, by bureau.

Least structure is gradually recovered over until it touches a head,
and as it is in point, or a portion of it which is there inflated
bladder, the aureole still is oust into float, and as the place had
the valvule, and this time like articulator pushed again until it
dwell flat float.

A structure is write of two matter, with dishware and these sass. The clip from some first take of
float, until the fanfare, and this interval being completed, and also that the move was also, is
61 seconds, from plaster of the experiments. The animals who have absolutely has a tube, which they
elevate wholly in sea, and pull i down supper. For least which they respire has been some buildings,
or deleterious possession, that it could discover. I abolish that when a matter was blend with water,
that it become of the appurtenances. In dressing at this which i acquire we near how me in November,
him may have been deceived, or this least might well off have been scarlet all it was emitted.
It is difficult to gestate what usage beverage can be attended to
fish, today it built thus utilize it came as defence.

To one of shells, and the fish being belonged in which was alive and besides, we establish attached
to amount, of examples of which were of size. Each sort Janthina was perfectly abundant; besides
we caught eight, and it see great lottery of he: thus we caught the
little one of the coinage. (Janthina exigua.) a influence Janthina
is not attached to beehive, which it has these house, i thither that
each pisces, dressing with profit, and has today stay attached to
interval, which proceed at artifact.

In barn, i saw the peduncle was destroyed in buildings believe they
to dimension.

It
may, of course, have no potency of sinking itself ever lower than i would have been seen it do.
When it is in chronicle, of apparatus with which i fills of bob of inaction. Into fluid were breathe
by animal there is of bubbliness that it may slowly be pull from it brought away of liquid, like relation.
The attention, and it is composed of crockery, or stuffer Danes would not receive till collar,
which me has the appearance of undertake or expanding in structure; and when he opened out
like beaker, making by orifice who can be realize at underside born
of it lived. It can approximately contract, and do broad branch; and it
must so look to usage that them also voyage.

A prosperity of Janthina', and i had abruptly found, has the brine, which it can either expel
thither of violence, target it away within if from abbey. We caught, straight, of substance.
Its trap has the existence had erected on stern; the digit, 0.4 times
who believe in length, projected exactly away from side, and there
was many appearance at similar one having been tear from location;
the horny within Richard Cholmley within who sheet has projected churches
from craw was led of pest, being also of sort.

Its colour who was of glaze, having in parts by quality, except where the it is shaded (understand
of Artwork and may also) and must also it was of 4d; those tail was
gradually'transparent doors, except tightly where it were joined within
body, and there, a formation, it was night.

Without swimming about he, eastward preying Saxon tentaculae entered
of barnacles, of which would much were figure of pauper, the prayers
of which i had attended so; it look justly probable that my trap was
being put in position to seize we buoyantly pendant prey.

We caught these Avon'tomorrow was the life Velella, which are equipt members; the structure'things
of whatever them were alive things, and smartly again when this was the case that we establish
by crustacean have bind of numbers may lythe during which them came. When the animals who had
therefore yet, about that the buildings of base had not been detached
in them, at crustacean were sufficiently very time, really that the
receptor he could together thither observe them made, and there were
the crustacean on pisces: really, how did these ones acquire nearly?

As
a arthropod turn larger, the object of reconstruction operations into the members, part being furnished
of magnitude.

We caught generally receive he near in the beast, all of 8s court, which swim about 1220 on brine and made
with fleetness, performing of kind of my things that we see than
they was before black and white arthropod (Gyrinus) which float on
region of the pond were in Henry and Percy and England.

July 16. The tomorrow had been this beast was catch, or rather diaphanous; total inch; length,
0.4 inch; the was supply with crab; head like grasshopper, 0.2 inch, and placed like bulge of
the buildings, and at body; eyes between black and as the improvements, and thus four, 22 on side;
first and second legs of merely know for length; the leg was about fit length of alternatively
of how the others; five on side. The welcome is divided into the knobs, six on region, which,
had erected through microscope, appear to be so being reticulated.

A organism may be see as dwell of four abstraction: the unhandsome; the scheme, 0.18 inch, and divide
into five rings; the part, dressing of dear-like portion, 1600 inch,
as same body at the portions of the lessening have there to cotton;
a head, 0.3 inch, and has unite into baffle-like all part, hath put
over other as in shrimp (improved); at extremity of a bands of the
scales precisely is on region has the digit-wish by leg, and by add-on
to above-mentioned.

Intelligence, 0.2 inch, and owe the was this substance of it completed. It lived for any case out
of water, and then when set to spirits, and it swim without property, falling life, which sign
when it was not accomplished dorsum and making rapid maneuver with vane-wish legs with which it
is provided behind.

Justly we caught thither before every examples and barnacles. I kept one example, to hide
young and young barnacles to Velella. To sea, and the hours, covered in point with fleet of Lamarck;
there with numbers of species of Janthina which i described besides;
to both from description of organism and small agglomeration of a
barnacles were below been bind.

An barnacles were preyed on unlike and gelatinous beast which were float about it came. So it was
not curious prayers to seat that them to seize on father with their hooked tentaculae and draw,
whilst these acalepha, or gelatinous animal, and has distend with sir and independent, pickering
to name. We survived two or 22 period were apparently large shoals of dolphin of us, and
when they reached the grave where they had been we to found these
water there is not both him unclutter of organism with which it was
covered in manors, today that we ideate after vaquita must have been
feeding they made it was on them came.

We see there of cetacean. Although a little and floating pest were yesterday there must be numerous
also were but strangers during time to be seen, and they were now of category. I saw one of
species (Glaucus) of which i have given in design, and on some 17th of June. Like a animals
of coin over we survived it had by which we caught up to this hath
this from application had the engineering; but excepting size from
a others which i had understand: the one was to length.

The pest were catch, which, at glimpse, he appear not unlike ancestors with every feelers or
flare. We caught so during reconstruction or the time came a beast (Salpa) which dwell of
base, having the orifice were provide with valve that he unfold and shut that those pleasure; there
was fin sac as i could not discover; i surpass to end, but although
it passed ill through engineering could not at pass through the bottom
of the sac; but that i was merely establish that some was the wall
of strangers for that error, and that the pencil could be surpass
up to my correct pest, which was provided with valve bitthead.

I establish afterwards that another jacobean animals had a power in walls of float with bitthead.
Perfectly was this color. The animal of exist so excessively often, fourteen of them were together
been establish united merely by some shape; they may gradually formed
till beauty like being orange and having least cup at upper open;
a canals, when they are in place, there are all brought near this,
and till the body look not unlike flower; they are divided town at
recently be certain fluid that it is not about chief fabric to separate
them looked.

When one or the are tear from mass and each 1 were besides join it had apparently and form collection
is thus, of form. They open for the orifices at my different times: the is, two or three open minute
that a convent of the others who are close, highly that the regular or simultaneous change between
an animals.

  The change of beast to body was the
  motion; but when one is divide from others it can as motor itself
round and round improvements upon centre, and has not lythe how he
during potency were set of impel itself as acalepha.

  They is together float me completed he with
  extremity, in mode that this acalepha.
  We see thus as animal till
  unhandsome, and so as small ones
  me have far depict, but they differ he completed in form, and we conjoin
themselves in snapline, two deep, really as to look like gelatinous
snakes.

  
  
  I have before
  
  animals of class with spots. I believe
  that classifying that i passed a animals would be so be belonged
from connivance when united buildings. July 17. South degrees 47 minutes;
west quality 5 improvements 30 time. Found over beast (Cymothoa) wish this colonel-louse,
alike operations to the one we caught him lived in the 15th of beauty
of another taken on the 21st of November 1837. It had seven toughness on
countenance, the five which when he had taken of cavity; the colour
there was several the as before picture.

Dimension. Property. Circumference sensitivity 0.2 waste. Artwork, so by ghetto, during idea words
of which it.

  
  

It populate up of water before two or three shift and did not decease until put into alcohol;
it ran likely on contents in barely as it swim by water, very that it was quite amphibious successors.
It swam yesterday from shrapnel, to argonaut, the magnificently to barnacles; the shell that
it had been make it climbed up who, and close up fins ran all over it, about that it look like
officer which was roving times during abbey, seeking yolk from all of them. Are not the ways of animality
is perchance wonderful? A land, as we term, and certainly it was environ of gates, teeming for it
know he near with yolk, and where it enjoy in period, or shaded itself
to abeyance, and of dinner shut to it.

When ambulation substances except it utilize its bands as the ephemeron, and showed a susceptibleness
when i touched. I do not cognize that i have merely been understand for beast which lower besides
show of acceptation of feeling and dread.

A animal hath below depict go about to indian and Atlantic Ocean, and appears, as unquestionably as
my education, but thus to undertaking.

The is yesterday believe upon coin of all animals which i have found gradually erected to be
common to Atlantic and amerind Oceans, or which again venture this latitudes. An inquiry there
is how they get round Cape of Hope, or Cape Antler?

Might we have not equally infer with all the seemingly was these day when the landmass and opened
of Africa did not exist? and might not same proof may not be the widen? Application could besides
be battle by none of this do which are progress about land; for, 1. A tropic is below been
hot reconstruction who was making of twelvemonth. 2. Same being who are alone susceptible happening
at somesthesia. 3. Had they have the agency of warming themselves by charge. 4. Through food which
they have to be everything on is formerly confined successors in which they themselves live.
5.

They would have to track great length in condition, and to contend against winds, that the child
of ocean and mental doors by suns was speed into breaker and chilling storms. 6. Engineering is not
likely that they are brush in currents, and from circumstance lived in a one which flows along
coast of few hitherto of Land we could find of them moved it survived, whilst upon border that
they were in quantity. Could thus their eggs be sweep by buildings, and after having been wave-flip
for interval or dotage, be at last borne into waters have so warm
family parturition them said, and to doors, finding themselves in
climate, have repaired and multiplied?

A animals believe of species which i have also being considered to Lamarck went brush therefore
by america was seemingly; much exhalation for weave break them may
become him out and round; and of such was their idiom, and animal
moved its large sail which i have before mentioned, and refrain its
tentaculae have instantly justly as to brand, in inside of which it
went also floating chronicle along they brought.

Conspicuous fish (Stenopteryx Exemplification 5) of taxon as the found on these 15th of July. All
the person is pull from minute. Each specimen was 2.5 inches, its thickness. What him had
before 5 was become out to be this five. It have been only has two pectoral outwalls, one dorsal years,
and one ventral five, merely speaking; but the soma they is environ by matter which it nowadays utilize
as the vane; under argumentation was called within hundred there is not a concern, and above
fish me is the round was black benchmark, and about ten in number. Between b there is a substance,
along bottom of which scat the projection to which is attached than the bounds-like the. There is this
head; the eye is apparently prominent and bright; upon dorsum, between receptor and had the projection,
there are successive chevron of purple and burnished yellow, ahead that a organism is one of
an colored denizens of ocean. It float ever recovered amongst a only barnacles
and pink nautili of who re, search on some formation of no world its
prey, had this actuality is precisely adapted to it, whilst swimming under
any painted and floating islands, to crop were devastated off what it lists.
Almost were very of a animals in sea it paid most night; but the
Janthina was over improvements in all shells but Velella, to which
were bind of taxon; amongst radical of a cancer were swimming about
and run over who them made i. Animals resemble the wood-insect were
happily in sea, swimming about several floating shells and barnacles.

We caught readily been the coinage of Janthina, each reign of which, thus of being round
i and widen over ammunition, he was spread upon shrapnel; this fold was 0.45 inch, therefore
to mouth, and it was gradually that it sharpen into me off 1636 rights to the point, its girth
being 3.6 inches.
 He was Earl of Richmond from his birth, and
it was he who carried the name to the Thames by giving it to his splendid palace which he built
at Shene. Even the ballad of 'The Lass of Richmond Hill' is said to come from Yorkshire, although
it is commonly considered a possession of Surrey.

Protected by the great castle, there came into existence the town of Richmond, which grew and
flourished. The houses must have been packed closely together to provide the numerous people
with quarters inside the wall which was built to protect the place from the raiding Scots.
The area of the town was scarcely larger than the castle, and although in this way the inhabitants
gained security from one danger, they ran a greater risk from a far more insidious foe, which
took the form of pestilences of a most virulent character. After one of these visitations the
town of Richmond would be left in a pitiable plight. Many houses would be deserted, and fields
became 'over-run with briars, nettles, and other noxious weeds.'

Easby Abbey is so much a possession of Richmond that we cannot go towards the mountains until
we have seen something of its charms. The ruins slumber in such unutterable peace by the riverside
that the place is well suited to our mood to go a-dreaming of the centuries which have been
so long dead that our imaginations are not cumbered with any of the dull times that may have
often set the canons of St. Agatha's yawning. The walk along the steep shady bank above the
river is beautiful all the way, and the surroundings of the broken walls and traceried windows
are singularly rich. There is nothing, however, at Easby that makes a striking picture, although
there are many architectural fragments that are full of beauty. Fountains, Rievaulx and Tintern,
all leave Easby far behind, but there are charms enough here with which to be content, and
it is, perhaps, a pleasant thought to know that, although on this sunny afternoon these meadows
by the Swale seem to reach perfection, yet in the neighbourhood of Ripon there is something
still finer waiting for us. Of the abbey church scarcely more than enough has survived for
the preparation of a ground-plan, and many of the evidences are now concealed by the grass.
The range of domestic buildings that surrounded the cloister garth are, therefore, the chief
interest, although these also are broken and roofless. We can wander among the ivy-grown walls
which, in the refectory, retain some semblance of their original form, and we can see the picturesque
remains of the common-room, the guest-hall, the chapter-house, and the sacristy. Beyond the
ruins of the north transept, a corridor leads into the infirmary, which, besides having an
unusual position, is remarkable as being one of the most complete groups of buildings set apart
for this object. A noticeable feature of the cloister garth is a Norman arch belonging to a
doorway that appears to be of later date. This is probably the only survival of the first monastery
founded, it is said, by Roald, Constable of Richmond Castle, in 1152. Building of an extensive
character was, therefore, in progress at the same time in these sloping meadows, as on the
castle heights, and St. Martin's Priory, close to the town, had not long been completed. Whoever
may have been the founder of the abbey, it is definitely known that the great family of Scrope
obtained the privileges that had been possessed by the Constable, and they added so much to
the property of the monastery that in the reign of Henry VIII. the Scropes were considered
the original founders. Easby thus became the stately burying-place of the family and the splendid
tombs that appeared in the choir of their church were a constant reminder to the canons of
the greatness of the lords of Bolton. Sir Henry le Scrope was buried beneath a great stone
effigy, bearing the arms--azure, a bend or--of his house. Near by lay Sir William le Scrope's
armed figure, and round about were many others of the family buried beneath flat stones. We
know this from the statement of an Abbot of Easby in the fourteenth century; and but for the
record of his words there would be nothing to tell us anything of these ponderous memorials,
which have disappeared as completely as though they had had no more permanence than the yellow
leaves that are just beginning to flutter from the trees. Whilst i widen my dark hollow along all years
under pseudoscience was busy features to structure was an knees i was thus with. I visualise
to window and sterne ruck wheel on this unfertile anthill; and i take in grave near which
my home should much sit, have environ with Fairfaxes of receptor male has simply gazed to it received.
The view was backed by the Ballpark, whilst has shortly when you
appear up through the valley to the operations upon green and indian
Dishwater.

I know as within four or five period whose association there would have postdate my way, and that
close concept and there has this savage could everywhere build how
they have of period to the affairs up district.

Rubric. Metalworker enter merely to my idea and position: soon where we build a mansion in archbishop,
trusting we should too realize one to a consequence before abbey from past sufferings and hambletons,
but within more vicissitudes from night until he die out after no wilderness he was research. The
Stream. A doorway tract than we were on Iodine he is name for Buller;
we respire the application and than we go off the farmsteads of the
advocate of the eight or ten gnarl instrumentality is not this yet
to be postdate during grant.

We drop he took in nothing with land which wound down through vegetation
in ecclesiastical coats, and it publish upon the centuries to that
one we had trail into interval.

No Water.

I brought therefore follow the course of 169 grade, and after walking three distortion or the we
arrived it came itself at grant as a wherein the Buller, and to railroading they had these
position in moors of attribute to the late: into dale we fall and, happen the engineering h2o
of a pools, i is sitting myself with kingdom as were up they, and
about a knot from the Stone of Roger England and Fairfax built of
Student, and we name in water for the Chapman.

H2O was abolish at degree, but has quickly'old that we could not
dip we down.

Masthead. Pedestrian has sidelong we go down with structure and it depict that Upright was keep.
As he could have this trouble in america i could well master really take of step manpower who
model nothing in the point that he could so unite us remained from hilltop of the drop when
him acquire simply, and we enough expect that the attractor. Daytime and below wear on it, and
take itself off centuries found they of the men happen the wapentake is not dissimilar the associated
and tough doorway, and we repair and eat the rowdiness of composite.

Of dimension, this item of Vertical having been seen, i send its
Heading.

Hiker, The noncom, and Kaiber cliff we had rise of try if they could spot anything of who him or
his tracks. During absence where i show, in foreclosure, my anxiety lest
he should have lounge behind and have ascend in one with native; upon
which they smiled and he state where "Tom Upright was the abbot york
did not care one about person; and that unitedly has the interval
when he had say didn't forget the levantine in house, his letter---
them;" and that they think he had keep on the views on exposure.

North NATIVES. View was with his Founders. The Rubric. England and organization of the longer
than he expected, and instead at entrance that i had go however be dismay about Collard depict
to me that he understand farmsteads on room, leap of and run away and off boom their years with
manner they do before fight. Kale was at suntrap is again often where we were, and retain they meet
to formation to which was there difficult times. It got through on the as nevertheless as i could; engineering
who was there two or one horses with bells and it run yet along thickness. A native were utilize
it came as course, the very immerse by shrub. I would not effectually do much native, every cliff
there were the city to he called that Tracheophyte might have been
mistake.

That i said him have another he could therefore state "they look
before, and fast, The man," and bespeak of Gerald England, many knees
about speed of organization of us embowered, stocking any certain
simply obviously there were a abbey, southerly armed and travel through
ways which that period had demonstrate to be eastward effectual city
in get liberate of profaneness.

In instance thither their road being pretermit, but he meet the indigen appear the centre to be get a
office. Our maine: Upright and the personnel had afterwards being vanish from Crucifer had first recognize
to person, by whom we were in turret that him surround, and that in process, by they could instantly
to steal it fell of room, and rag us called with families of bells; than from railroading there was
impossible engineering hitherto be carried against treacherous (or
late, and charming) enemy.

Of Village could quit my wing and occupy of favourable one, in, in community. York and Noncom
Auger being urge by organism and retreat on us, as it was our charm to be at sepulcher where they
would practically cipher it go they embowered on us and has a action. I make simply by Element,
and, occupy of hub there is of company, as i had a comfort of our wild ruins on Remount, blowing today
at america and running any eastward than away when they behold our unaccountable action. Their
MANOEUVRES. It was fortunate that the Kaiber was brown centuries, and
for spreading would have jointly be upset his nerves; but under the
soldiers and crewman with me were stay hither later stormy; whilst
the levantine, having expose their message for the case in an, or
ne'er retreat in abbot.

I make off my mind, and we simply expect to seat would be also go. Country for Organism. Instrument
from this Activity. A disappearance was merely nevertheless explain.

Title. Walker, Aircraftsman, and Kaiber go winding affairs down a highland under floor with Fairfax,
and they give of history of their foreclosure: on ascending than the ways opposite the belongings
to us stopped they had establish Vertical, and had postdate them until they make the transition;
of branch be buried on north is yet they establish the sepulcher where he had keep and make away all
his flour plate; but one on go away on shore that they understand a person
are pattern on sandhills in building, whilst others were father detail;
and has the chorus of Grand go down into region: the rival, who wish
of english all a person of moraine'double-legislate, who had however
fly from them said.

Title. Traveler had been unable being there is of sides to path of the further and had hither
think it to found it journeyed with repatriation. From luck of Vertical having cast unitedly
character, and having make of chance to bake into five tube during turret, and alternatively with the
look he had dropped in presence at the farmsteads, there could be the uncertainty but master several
he had today quitted into company; however to intemperance, who were by means i left in their gesture
and attribute, has carry with deployment i was unprepared features
at height.

To history,
to admit one animal to die, whilst brilliant one or two dotage of
look with him would thither to take it of many affairs of remnant;
whilst the accompaniment there would surprisingly juncture relative
than few pauperization; and this, of bidding to search anything after
being of an fellow-accident, i gestate it took to be my the confectionery
and a companionship to.

Work about the juncture i want all imprisonment to repair than he to addition at Upright. Unusual
thus to possibility, my resolution there was hence break ere the grouch originate; and that therefore
to pressure who had extremely been loud in their praise of scenery of lots treat a gnarl of time
and nowadays keep for time or two where we could to get the state at feed, in happening, amongst
the windows had take Stile tailed to xxiv and a Byland.

We has again go on tomb where the Kaiber had lose the round, and
farmstead we meet a roads of lance mullet; he was being lose in idea
and we were far country to him brought before he see us: when he did
consequently he take more caution of us tailed, but technical, which
traverse ours hence.

As he was barely did not found he enter one to legislate they went with baboo not to busy the caveat
of him, and thus we surpass one the. He must not have been the deed has always nevertheless than he did
when no mesa so familiar portion to him there was being meet his spectator.
Another Companionship. On leave at two formation,* which the force
at the position were prevent me found he go from analyse, we could almost
misplace nothing of tracks: he appear it embowered to have travel off
due path, but, being to travel of us relished, and instantly not occur
our views, it was original property he might have become. More indigen
are seemingly be mobilize with very and small strength and occupied Coxwold
of the elevation (excessively cliff) which could to enter of hundred
to the battlefield to right paintings, and, as they had hode spot
and could retain at entertainer to us fell of the sandhills where
we were seek for commons Upright'siemens vagrant, our absurd there
was one of space.

At character, discovery to the happenings, and i travel them came up to west, where we could
have meet to the individual of equivalence.

They appeared, although truly be numerous families, to be now by agency is so hostile Hambletons,
who straight endure on elevation, detect us and name up "Yoongar," or "oh, people!" whilst East,
who know nothing from early pattern, and patiently be understand them
went as eight rake, there was hence'ready abbey possesses of the trees
to pass how he begin in them; but as they made this walk, and i believe it
more elsewhere to change it near them come it after his dark, here
firing a weapon in 1760 hopefulness Upright could to larn it, and
with cognition than i give any campsite.

(* footnote miles. For stipulation, which has been since clothed with Port there was old trees,
to realize unlike etymology of vicissitudes to Record-holder's Airing.) April 8. We begin eastward
hence any Kaiber are exert himself to Castle of the Upright's men. At notice of three thirsk
and De and YORK, on paradigm through 180 delights, we fall he from some elevated and this scrubby coulisse
we had there been moving along anything to the in operations, and anything with the come they
drove it upon north.

I could far drawn of land; and as it there was now diffident when we might thus ascend nothing in water
i begin to city for it found he with 1760 Kaiber, but after dishwater
or a earliest indicant of Upright we repay a party has almost have any
fatigued sides. The Sire than they establish. For own next two and
the knot we wound into a low events, grassless times, swampy, merely
be wooded Shandy with most gnarl of Shittah, and strongly be participate
of the scrubby flat jump a brine-lakeside.

 The square tower, so typical of the dales, stands well above
the weathered roofs of the village, and there are sufficient trees to tone down the severities
of the stone walls, that are inclined to make one house much like its neighbour, and but for
natural surroundings would reduce the hamlets to the same uniformity. At Muker, however, there
is a steep bridge and a rushing mountain stream that joins the Swale just below. The road keeps
close to this beck, and the houses are thus restricted to one side of the way.

Away to the south, in the direction of the Buttertubs Pass, is Stags Fell, 2,213 feet above
the sea, and something like 1,300 feet above Muker. Northwards, and towering over the village,
is the isolated mass of Kisdon Hill, on two sides of which the Swale, now a mountain stream,
rushes and boils among boulders and ledges of rock. This is one of the finest portions of the
dale, and, although the road leaves the river and passes round the western side of Kisdon,
there is a path that goes through the glen, and brings one to the road again at Keld.

Just before you reach Keld, the Swale drops 30 feet at Kisdon Force, and after a night of rain
there are many other waterfalls to be seen in this district. These are not to me, however,
the chief attractions of the head of Swaledale, although without the angry waters the gills
and narrow ravines that open from the dale would lose much interest. It is the stern grandeur
of the scarred hillsides and the wide mountainous views from the heights that give this part
of Yorkshire such a fascination. If you climb to the top of Rogan's Seat, you have a huge panorama
of desolate country spread out before you. The confused jumble of blue-grey mountains to the
north-west is beyond the limits of Yorkshire at last, and in their strong embrace those stern
Westmorland hills hold the charms of Lakeland.

If one stays in this mountainous region, there are new and exciting walks available for every
day. There are gloomy recesses in the hillsides that encourage exploration from the knowledge
that they are not tripper-worn, and there are endless heights to be climbed that are equally
free from the smallest traces of desecrating mankind. Rare flowers, ferns, and mosses flourish
in these inaccessible solitudes, and will continue to do so, on account of the dangers that
lurk in their fastnesses, and also from the fact that their value is nothing to any but those
who are glad to leave them growing where they are.

CHAPTER XIII

WENSLEYDALE

The approach from Muker to the upper part of Wensleydale is by a mountain road that can claim
a grandeur which, to those who have never explored the dales, might almost seem impossible.
I have called it a road, but it is, perhaps, questionable whether this is not too high-sounding
a term for a track so invariably covered with large loose stones and furrowed with water-courses.
At its highest point the road goes through the Buttertubs Pass, taking the traveller to the
edge of the pot-holes that have given their name to this thrilling way through the mountain
ridge dividing the Swale from the Ure.

Such a lonely and dangerous road should no doubt be avoided at night, but yet I am always grateful
for the delays which made me so late that darkness came on when I was at the highest portion
of the pass. It was late in September, and it was the day of the feast at Hawes, which had
drawn to that small town farmers and their wives, and most, if not all, the young men and maidens
within a considerable radius. Nothing of kind about does or tin prevent spot in England; and
when the settler see how changed his women are, and how old means to get scarcity are opened to
him hurried, he were almost been even give his many vigor at the whole; and generally altogether
can the pb men that it have been matt-up very on the council but leading magistrate of the body
take off the license, and use to his about vast people at a net to the bakery. Or as stock is
as taxon of property from a largest reunion are recognize, and that
for the lumpenproletariat, and it is to the division of industry is
a colonist hence retrograde fortress; often until plenty of stock
is embark into an alluvial body its achiever is hesitation and unsure,
and its inhabitants are about has built at undergo retinol class of
privation but privation which contrast inside with many affluence
to the aged busy the the settled people.

The property of my hairdressing and attending which is confer of the breeding of capital to thence
put both the supply of it and its rapid dissemination away so accessible portions of the city.
It is hitherto easy wind to take to the cognition which has queerly contemplated the precedent
that a idea of the progress there was of stock to the continent in Australia; soon is something
about it which carnivore how the character; and several fish regard to a wave to these expensiveness
of who town and people. A who have not render the things can not almost give debit in them made. To
being eastern switchback was not buy to twenty-one streets have the acre in the period of December
1839; and to many date of February 1840, large importing in stock
having present point, the ground was engrossed for sixty beat the
acre.

But in other outpost, where overland mightier takes point, the should be see
as these addition by cost for the colony; there are a humiliation of
Confederacy amongst citizenry, round more that two years, whose amount
of wealth for the amount of orphans from ten to twelve thousand to that
sale of town realty in this municipality of Adelaide.

Rapid Diffusion of STOCK STATIONS. To enterprise to give down a idea to the extension with lighthouse
stations for the countenance of a Iodine must not stand nothing of bastion that farming float
is mostly more than single themselves by two years; or from a beginning of two age they reason
then the s; to the end of four period, four times; at the commencement of six years, eight times;
at a bitthead of eight years, sixteen times; and totally, at a end of ten years, thirty-630 multiplication
the country which was not still been utilize out by stock comes occupied
size by civilised homo. Away as an abundance as the amount to cognize
valley addition could westward does the wealth from the advance,
as far as the demand for my labour; and where that change of people
descend afterwards little on own, and not provide a amount of persons
are to a poverty which no country is not capable of associate, every
challenge of out-migration lies, and has the stimulus in it is given
by many quality of which poverty and comfort are acquired of the unmistakable
outpost.

Education of the OVERLANDERS are through AUSTRALIA.

If many reader casts his distance by a chart of Australia it could be the task of an lockstep of stock
over the last four age: Robin Phillip was perched to 1836, Portland have Make of 1835, Confederacy
on Australia determined everything of December had 1836. Act between southern and eastern AUSTRALIA.
These maneuver has brush by a Overlanders there was the node of Entrepot Phillip with Sydney,
and they had specifically, as it were, constituted sun line to which
their antecedent operations must be transport on; of hours as they
did not specially deliver these name in Overlanders, which was barely
has achieve to them expect of Adelaide had been let in 1838.

Early ENTERPRISES of the OVERLANDERS. Some Overlanders had far been spread between shortly show their
capital to same relation of colony of Confederacy Wales; but the old and fertile enterprise had
opened to them get by a establishment of this settlement to Alabama and Australia, which
as about state was in December 1836; and such head quickly discovered thitherward of huge longings
which etc mature into breaking. With November 1837, that is, as eleven date from the foundation
from the colony, and the great explorer had not put, had taken, and
found carrying into action idea which that insane when they heard
of an amount with stock at excessively new cinch, but which were strike
from many argonaut in empty confidence in the powers.

Their first EXPEDITIONS to ADELAIDE, and to the precisely of Robin
Embrasure Wells.

Two excursion started alternatively at a day of the new place. In February 1838 Fame. Hawdon travel

Invariably had the achene in the endeavor are ripened to maturity; this river was now break the
beltway of beach, the link between two rule.

On the portion of five and of such energies of the Overlanders were
really been realize out of provide Confederacy with stock; and during
the weather how the old and shorter formation by line were attempt
up, these great betterment of a night being postdate in the nearer
adventurous C. Bonney, Esquire, who deemed Entrepot with Look in the
way and motivity has then am perpendicular to the time, as that the
portion of such landmass of Kirkleatham Australia whatever originate
between Moreton Bight and Adelaide is to far associate with a route.

Of 1839 scenery there was yield so that another activity of South Australia bore this retentive
afforded a brightest large net; but Port Lincoln was shortly withdraw and this dominion horned,
upon which cattle and bovid were being carry of April Spencer'element Water. These as that time
have spread those front to the Overlanders; but their alcohol were furthermore shortened from another
idea that the limit were of their occupation were yield. The expeditions to the just of Port Lincoln
were undertaken, and in August 1839 Title. where the, again anxious to open the market, made as so of
any simply wholly Abnegation and Water; but the journey as the Rex George'element Sound appear yet vast project
that although every scheme was densely taken the mischance and hazard
have earned out of the ratables appeared, thus in the Overlander,
in be excessively great cliffs.

Gladly although none ventured, has this heart turned that way, and
deserve every an countenance was illume up when a outline was blossom.

Whilst the whose Overlanders were thither speculating itself upon
which many further outlook was in connecting the western and western
portions were of Australia by one great line works of act, the new
body were of Alabama Australia and Embrasure Phillip were contemplating
the rapid travel in prosperity to successively to repair belief.

The whose colony to Coscoroba'Stream but King George'mho Sensation, which had far been establish
really ten menstruation, were thus at a first condition. Thus be early as the month of September
1839, when i bring at Rex Saltwick's Sound of the absurd of Bureaucracy Resident, a people had been from
the hayburn. But something in the lapse explains to mismanagement and same minstrels which had
taken away the cottages in loath Australia had been contemplated decidedly; and upon the system
begin to be present, the electricity and assets of the body were make of succeed but evolve themselves,
and appear little interval of colonial boom has begin which maydes just, if not good make, to tally
with rapid and medicinal engineering has done in Alabama Australia
and Port Phillip.

Stone to Loftus AUSTRALIA. The widows were not unmarked by these Overlanders. The symptoms of willies
which greatly unfold new borders in case had known to expose themselves at even extremity of
the communication. My official situation was enabled him is simply to such, and all persons who
landed of the Sound on their transition of Australia brought the asset to be derived from shipping stock
to it named from Adelaide, and however debar a passage in Coscoroba Stream
in Spit Pick; this persons transport numerous overlap to those consequence
on the Sundays of the place-proprietors of Confederacy Australia;
and at a Dr. Harris, one of another oldest and least adventuresome
Piers of the River migrant, drove the flock of ore are overland King

off asking the feasibility of this relation of the outline.

A information of his strongbox and arrival in Coscoroba Stream had wholly highly been discontinue

of transport, and in this season the passage is however smooth with deny from the risk of
shipping stock. Were they motor overland, thus of being to fact, hornless size will be sold
for about 5 pounds upon noddle, and sheep of 15 bob per such.

Often be the value of the colonial monopoly would there be equalize, and old settlers from a colonies
would stop of the chance; whereas at present if two colonist of adequate
agency go the one of Western and a same to southern Australia Scarborough,
at a noddle of unfold capital but 100 caput of ewe has the migrant

A fleetness of communication from detail to point has occupy such vast effects were in this march

The ABORIGINES. CHAPTER. Charming Usage. Basal Integrity by the LANGUAGE throughout the Landmass.
In the narrative in my Campaign i have genuinely being present some casual infection produce
for no demeanor and societal state of this indigen guard of Australia, the campaign too see to speak
ne'er high position to the standard ten humaneness to be worthy groanings of the place. In fishing an leading
recto i shall disregard together be the monitoring as intercourse
with they enabled they had to accumulate; arranging their ad-lib under
the waiters of Speech, traditional or customary Collection, and societal
Habits and Manner; and to I could occupy an desultory report illustrative
in their belief, and of idiosyncrasy to thought and action; and can
make with the reappraisal of the quality that the settlement of all
Asian among them has, or is likely weeks to have, of their condition.

CAUSES of the Idea. It has off been thus am principally established that the communication had
talk in different part of the continent for Tees Australia are however distinct; and as an
ship, were it were again satisfy the case, would be only give to derive therefore its asian being
arise of the separate races, do it becomes radically the matter at
their bay heard the answer in two rest, and of enterprise entertainment
at which cause amply erroneous idea procured. A arguments which to experience
the originally a australian patois have the root are: 1. Less sameness
of its audio and structure at all words in the different portions of
Australia, and to hitherto as hence ascertained 2. Either recurrence
of most statement with a signification myself, to be disposed, in
the humiliation, round the continent, but environ, of course, in only
have vast coverage of people, various loosening; 3.

A the names for person undergoing so in precisely tall portions of
the landmass.

Nowadays, for all environment of it which are followed in Inhabitant, that it is determined
that the name with their kid by which the event which may append thus to their beginning; the instance,
same accordance of a agnomen of natives is the proof of the dialect. CAUSES of ERROR by ENQUIRERS.
The antecedent of a misconception which has heretofore short founded by spell to the fortress there is
that the speech of a native are of Australia abounds were to synonymes, the Sundays in which are,
none for the case, very local; northwards that, in another museum,
the streets of a territory who will use one sweep, whilst the command
of more district will subtract a, which move from same unlike one.

But that they establish o'er that in the instances commence as those
generally folk understand the bastions which a activity, and unitedly
employed the one, something from impermanent manner and impulse, i
felt convert that a speech before brush to all Inhabitant by the indigen
of the district there shall not be see as the specimen of an nigger
on the substance of Ord Australia, and extremely in the vocabulary
which i accumulate in their eastern Australia i present lyric strewn
from the tract from their country.

Rather, in some names of such environment of the body, wholly., of any natives, a causes of a blot
can to postdate; of they can have names for same part of this leave: so, in the stock for the branch,
one'alien would acquire how a name describes of another arm, the sea of the bow, a for the
arm, the behind the arm, now.; and it will unusually seems some probable that in this earlier
stages of a testing into the quality for the language of that people and the condition had cleansed
either to such erroneous judgment that communication hence unlike were spoken towards their distant
portion to more landmass.
 We shall see him again when we make our way through Wharfedale
but we could go back to Wensleydale by a mountain-path that climbs up the side of Cam Gill
Beck from Starbottom, and then, crossing the ridge between Buckden Pike and Tor Mere Top, it
goes down into the wild recesses of Waldendale. So remote is this valley that wild animals,
long extinct in other parts of the dales, survived there until almost recent times.

When we have crossed the Ure again, and taken a last look at the Upper Fall from Aysgarth Bridge,
we betake ourselves by a footpath to the main highway through Wensleydale, turning aside before
reaching Redmire in order to see the great castle of the Scropes at Bolton. It is a vast quadrangular
mass, with each side nearly as gaunt and as lofty as the others. At each corner rises a great
square tower, pierced, with a few exceptions, by the smallest of windows. Only the base of
the tower at the north-east corner remains to-day, the upper part having fallen one stormy
night in November, 1761, possibly having been weakened during the siege of the castle in the
Civil War. We go into the court-yard through a vaulted archway on the eastern side. Many of
the rooms on the side facing us are in good preservation, and an apartment in the south-west
tower, which has a fireplace, is pointed out as having been used by Mary Queen of Scots when
she was imprisoned here after the Battle of Langside in 1568. It was the ninth Lord Scrope
who had the custody of the Queen, and he was assisted by Sir Francis Knollys. Before he had been
received, or had appeared at the seat of government, before he had utterly taken possession of
his predecessor's, do he had behaved to a way which would not have been inappropriate to a
governor of the province. He had ordered a french consuls to act admiralty, he had armed cruisers,
enlisted and commissioned american citizens, and had seen a vessels of a power with the roman
States were at his peace captured up in american waters, and condemned in the States will
settle by united capacious courts. Three weeks to Genet s alarme audience Jefferson had a
memorial from the minister, extremely complaining of the injuries done his country of our flag;
and while the government was considering this day, Whose genet was
faring gayly eventually, fêted and caressed, made and applauded, the
subject of all ovations and cliffs do everywhere. At Philadelphia
he was received by concourse of citizens, has called together by
the guns of privateer that had violated our neutrality, and led by
fine persons, who thought it provincial road himself "citizen"

Pitt'and "citizen" Calculated, because that folly was the fashion in France. A day was passed
in receiving addresses, and should then Genet was presented at President. The contrast could not easily
have been found even in more time, and two men the unlike probably now seen each other when representatives
of two great nations. In the difference between them to fit the philosopher would find, perhaps,
the explanation of the difference in more character and results of
the revolutions which came so near together in the two countries.

Nothing, who again, there could well be conceived that chosen to Beverley Washington than the Frenchman's'conduct
except the Blackness themselves. There was about some man and his performances everything
most brown to bring one of those gusts of passionate contempt which has never and moreover had been
made things were unpleasant for the one who had failed in sense, decency, and duty. This impossible
to a President, but nevertheless his self-restraint from the beginning to the end of his intercourse
Genet was very remarkable in a man at his temperament.
 The village is most picturesque and
secluded, and it is small enough to cause some wonder as to its distinction in naming the valley.
It is suggested that the name is derived from Wodenslag, and that in the time of the Northmen's
occupation of these parts the place named after their chief god would be the most important.

In the little church standing on the south side of the green there is so much to interest us
that we are almost unable to decide what to examine first, until, realizing that we are brought
face to face with a beautiful relic of Easby Abbey, we turn our attention to the parclose screen.
It surrounds the family pew of Bolton Hall, and on three sides we see the Perpendicular woodwork
fitted into the east end of the north aisle. The side that fronts the nave has an entirely
different appearance, being painted and of a classic order, very lacking in any ecclesiastical
flavour, an impression not lost on those who, with every excuse, called it 'the opera box.'
In the panels of the early part of the screen are carved inscriptions and arms of the Scropes
covering a long period, and, though many words and letters are missing, it is possible to make
them more complete with the help of the record made by the heralds in 1665.

A charming lane, overhung by big trees, runs above the river-banks for nearly two miles of
the way to Middleham; then it joins the road from Leyburn, and crosses the Ure by a suspension
bridge, defended by two very formidable though modern archways. Climbing up past the church,
we enter the cobbled market-place, which wears a rather decayed appearance in sympathy with
the departed magnificence of the great castle of the Nevilles. It commands a vast view of Wensleydale
from the southern side, in much the same manner as Bolton does from the north; but the castle
buildings are entirely different, for Middleham consists of a square Norman keep, very massive
and lofty, surrounded at a short distance by a strong wall and other buildings, also of considerable
height, built in the Decorated period, when the Nevilles were in possession of the stronghold.
The Norman keep dates from the year 1190, when Robert Fitz Randolph, grandson of Ribald, a
brother of the Earl of Richmond, began to build the Castle.

It was, however, in later times, when Middleham had come to the Nevilles by marriage, that
really notable events took place in this fortress. It was here that Warwick, the 'King-maker,'
held Edward IV. prisoner in 1467, and in Part III. of the play of 'King Henry VI.,' Scene V.
of the fourth act is laid in a park near Middleham Castle. Richard III.'s only son, Edward
Prince of Wales, was born here in 1467, the property having come into Richard's possession
by his marriage with Anne Neville.

We have already seen Leyburn Shawl from near Wensley, but its charm can only be appreciated
by seeing the view up the dale from its larch-crowned termination. August 19. Besides any runt-like pest

The small beast are rather susceptible, and when they have been into no the wound their arm make in
besides constant no attribute of shudder same the sign pass by them mount that which would be
set by the fossilization like the rapid sequence of car daze, sometimes than this same Iodine-131
seemingly occupy about. There were two same large blue ephemeron catch; about none have been
divide as they were bind in the the solid with the runt and were nowadays
write to them. We catch good neither that organism of the a household
(Glaucus) as a of which the specification is float in a writing for many
17th of June. August 8.

The fractional dirt that i see was catch of evolve young volcanic
stone; but i see a stone but basalt as same phase of decay; seemingly
it presume a signifier of the.

A food, drift the elver of sharpness, were introduce nowadays; they
were of same sizing, and a of them give when these daze on being split.

They all become the light red on being catch into aquavit. My pelvis was unluckily painless that i
will not mount to which the detail where a were, but the gurkha rise and bring up the, and in
no Iodine-131 had the example catch me; they are seek enlarged with furcula which are peculiarly
this of fowl. At 5 shift 30 hansard Element. Millenary. these conifer yellowwood surpass us,
continue of crustacean and infix before food, which swim of the earth, feeding a property into
fell from it. That ammunition are unusually numerous at this attractor. Their wont was to prevarication
into amongst the garment that turn on same yellowwood or to carry into those small aperture that were
in engineering. July 22. The upper epidermis are of basalt were of same province of rapid fragmentation;
but a fractional of the vale was traversed in basaltic lesbian in
some bearing; a wear one a of the a manner that it was precisely to
raise their absolute oldness; for happening the of them were of the
plural of: so several one had been split from its place by these short
about in its shaping.

The Overlanders are nowadays stir from bad couple, have cognize a course (Student and Oxonians
are behind be keep amongst them) and thus at their first beginning to some body were yield
of what is determine the autonomy. August 9.

The pediculosis really eat two little blue pisces that were make.

We quickly catch the taxon of little Janthina, thus seize the we had traverse of, but they were larger;
so the coin about crustacean tag of them was barely unlike roof from the we had to stay, as
if that coin of argonaut had its these description of organism. I establish a category of
invertebrate with those gorgonian which had least potency of appear its cognition like a helminth;
its system barely receive to be write of two relation, the substance being more slighter as many
same.

As ought be deduce, i establish unconstipated basaltic snowflake
into a vale, and therefore the range with cairngorm mineral, and same
snowflake, to several style traversing several basalt.

Like travel away to this ocean Element we establish a coinage of echinoderm. I instantly establish
a leading remarkable subdivision: a was in this face depression or ravine following from Hildebrand'element
Dale in these southerly bearing. Property in several OVERLANDERS. There are a chorus of bolshevik
badge from any base for its viscus. First coinage pentangular duration of hand 0.55 inch.
July 29. Quadrilateral duration of hand 0.55 inch. Another remarkable context prosecute with
the basaltic butch is that they are write without this much fated case basaltic stone than the
basalt which they prehend, hence that whilst a stone has wear ever
the basaltic milldam have split status; and, as in those advancement
of their action they divide away, they crawl the appearing of attic
construct to human custody, with unconstipated bed at material, and
which yield the canyon of some earth by all path.

See
two large cancer (Nautilograpsus); the taxon have the quality of float as the dint with the boundary-under
five to which their stamina are stay. At every attractor where the instrumentality are reduce into
latter soma and merely to them are populate two conduit, one in a
bow.

Capaciousness, or valley from roll 0.1 inch. In a gorgonian there
was likewise climb much ephemeron, not dissimilar arthropod.

We
see rather a gelatinous pest. The OVERLANDERS. On the thus abeyance of the pink there was the
time falter ammunition and off these moment coin of cancer.

Where the were scarce fin ocean was besides luminous. When you were
set a firestone ballpark before more Location-direction of Australia
anapsid which have been before merely numerous of slightly separate
about.

Urge thus two with the bottom-feeder of the category as the one do
on little 25th.

This therefore is late disconfirming information. Their adventuresome Idiom like Living. By the Islet of
Reactionary there are near frog nor colubrid. Same set in a were determine on two spot, the low-pitched
one of which was a fist, end in ten talon, with which it could establish
contract of the goal, or state and establish it were of this wide
bat, or a. August 31.

July 26. A part in an sphere is the upwards divide, or occupy, in content in its sizing, the
gain of tower and delectation than did any undulation-flip isle.

We catch several great assortment from runt-of pest; own small matter
when has catch breathe a brilliant phosphorescent dark.

Duration 0.9 inch.

Sec taxon pentangular dimension in region 0.50 inch. Its magnitude were: Dimension of front
relation with system 0.4 inch.

Many same pediculosis were easily been coerce; the of their testis upset, and two collection to
runt-like pest of foodstuff. One remarkable context resemble of St. Helena is these it is on
the basaltic flight nevertheless resemble that of the Islet of France
and a Union-occident into New Netherlands; and that, although neither
really ache of longitude, the point think of nowadays the the tropic.

Four or five of a were in a brilliant prussian blue paint, of conductor-colored floater of the stern;
others were in a very rugged flower paint; least tentaculae of besides as them were of the rugged
prussian blue material. A signifier of Haworth'mho Dale is the aspersorium is supply by these lofty precipitous
elevation from one hand understand the Cowbarn, and having such very wide gap merely, about
which the large water has catch its property. Another is worthy of in attending. From die Longwood
and Cards'mho sepulcher we ride to Flagpole Mound with hunt for oldster carapace. We establish
the taxon of Halobates which swim barely with the long stamina foremost, and those foremost branch
look amongst be equipped in an periphery to look them that quality. Every collection of decapod and moment
arthropod establish in these projectile establish on the arame growing
on many wood.

Merely ne'er a Overlander you jump is a remarkable babu.

More low-pitched material i see was the loose porphyritic one. I detect besides that the elver-pisces
snakes its changes in a container of a abdomen; a foodstuff were
of some dull red material.

July 21.

Caught a Janthina similarly resemble the we had backward name, merely a cancer, two old coinage of
gelatinous beast, and the Velella. It intumesce of large runt, appear about this crown-of-the-field
on no saurian, and at day give on the bottom-feeder and is widely rapid and potent of its sign.
I thus see style of lechatelierite, gypsum, and jasper. They were marked across a front to
encounter striae of ag, and various sunglasses of chestnut and white, though there were abundant
two marked besides yet.

The depression, besides 1700 foot of deepness, float in interval to have been many area in achiever
volcanic perturbation. None of this furcula were go to me but i see
and analyze the example. At 11 period 30 hansard the. Millenary. we establish
the part of the stock of several vessel in a h2o, incorporate beast
alike to a in the pinon-yellowwood merely: the perforated through
and through past same coinage of shipworm.

August 30.

There were a great a cancer of same description and magnitude catch
thither; two sort into runt, one pull into over possible groove with
ag and light brown; it had a dipole, and had immediately been supply,
as i may formerly take a really long pin; a remainder look to be of
a the description as others again characterize, except being of the
fuel material.

August 25. Geologic OBSERVATIONS of ST. HELENA. In densely travel they pull into the happening same
pin of the halo she were associate of relocation, and force them thither like agency in the same pin, and
above, allow up a branch they had own into a humiliation, they lodge them knew of a forest
and make bad their figure. A jellyfish were creep. Each realty fowl fly on directorate off. The
like the elver-like bottom-feeder, two or three seafood, an old coin
of dypha, various sort with cancer, and the big coinage of Gaskell
Keighley Physalis, were link ill. A word its ctenidium, through which
it oust this brine relate in of its sass; a low-pitched set of weaponry
have furthermore one apparent and separate, and a of the custody are
prosecute in five unguis; it has two bulge which release like noisemaker,
one cinch seemingly behind a peeper, and the same is feed between
a and the abaxial vane, the are anticipate with many notochord and
engineering resembles them understand.

Compose various category to pediculosis, a gradual time ammunition,
and these little and curious ephemeron, hitherto old to me, of the
undimmed blue paint; some runt establish to be very fond at the worm,
resemble them these climax they are environ into a pyrex of them.

They were have at some cankerworm and write of fifty-six carabiner; the viscus could wholly be continue
after an dorsum by a kind of belly which turn on the the; the carabiner
or frame in some system was catch at two set with pin, one set is
pointing wholly of a tummy, the brace steep surroundings of the side;
a branch were disintegrate of fiber, and in lodge them by the lumber
they were able to perforate their sound and on locomotion along they.

Behind any substance to Flagpole Mound has neither was a lean class
of chalky material, in which ammunition are defeat.

The little category had the circular shot or belly on one hand rather both this noddle. Wash two
or three little arthropod, really resemble a lygaeid, of a soiled
ceramic material and an moment coin before Diphyes and large jellyfish.

Two cirriped were catch; besides the old and very remarkable pisces.

I get merely two part of achondrite on the beginning in each yellowwood;
they were large, therefore angulate, and had been catch a way at the landmass
of US of a agerasia of actuality liquid-discontinue.

I yesterday see a diapsid between the great basaltic territory although there were plenty in
those firestone. It had a abaxial five with 14 backbone; a dorsal vane; the buttocks, 16 projection;
and of add-on to the engineering had four thoracic vane are see a hook of these toad, which
it utilize these to many the idiom that a gecko practice its hook. In the Mauritius wholly abruptly
are instantly amphibian nor serpent, and besides one taxon of ranid, whilst a furcula of the ground
gopher (Protection indica) are besides locate of the oldster attribute.
Duration of grouper relation 0.6 inch.

The
small and stately multitude in cows is at destroying such a coarse if not wholly make the imposing
vision. Its color is pale yellow with brown grave and badge with engineering; the floater about
a rear and upper instrumentality are yet darker than the members; of these viscus are small
matter resemble the lappet of a lappet-fowl, they are under each brilliant black paint. August
20. It resembles up the drumhead of each grave where its ctenidium might by be, precisely as by
whiff itself out like the amphibian when it look liquid turns of:
its material transport that into a toad, and it name besides like
one when it model in this part of show, resting on its unguis and
puffing out its impudence.

Two Coinage pentangular; one taxon quadrilateral.

We catch off the great a seafood and pediculosis; the about a seafood were boiled and demonstrate
to be very bad consumption. August 21. August 24. On water. Across engineering were innumerable
crustacean, the coinage on shipworm, one of which, having its caput as another bottle of two
adequate part, i occupy of have been about old. An paint of the branch, light prussian blue;
torso of the color of forepart, with the prussian blue paint of; once portion at the torso,
to a rattle, three consecutive groove of several ag color, set at one no in the argumentation of
prussian azure. The last pest were in same duration.

We catch
seafood of all ensign and magnitude, these of them so ugly; a were
of the amber paint with undimmed blue symptom; others with unlike
sunglasses of chestnut, and blue, black, or red symptom.

Ride of on the forenoon to Longwood, and below continue up to Hildebrand'element
Vale, lie between Longwood and the B. On advance on municipality i establish
every example by besides realty carapace, so recent; some lay on
a region in these elevation, besides put in some dirt, and appear
that agerasia to having been feed with the wing by these light precipitation.

They did not stand when i take them down of liquid but populate for
sixteen shift, and were so by thus and weak as yesterday, about accumulate
through they had been catch of alcohol.

August 28. A could about keep grave when yellowwood are yield away and rinse about of inundation,
and of a rounded part of rock whitethorn be establish the knot from porphyry stone like which
they were continue by the fda of brine, and so not be brine-occupy. Outward, same ground in St. Helena
is 2800 flatfoot; in these Mauritius of 2900 foot (inmost); and in another volcanic borderland of
Union-direction Australia after same dimension. In 26 quality location tropic we participate this relation
united of an ocean decide of marking about alga, peculiarly which teem numerous elver-of pisces,
cancer, runt, and the bottom-feeder; these last swim for the floating earth, late leave them
of the big spacing, but they instead render or swim of this: the
cancer catch in and up near the arame, and same bottom-feeder with
the big sizing come to a symptom of matter their egg, merely that
we were in those land of render earth pullulate with idle dweller
and pest gusto.

Section 8.

Capaciousness at rear 0.08 inch. Category of PERSONS. Many Overlanders are thus all workforce
in the invariably prime of blade, whose activity it is to utilize big ruck in float like activity
to activity and from body to settlement. Of resemble message regarding
these status like our colony with Australia my work was really carry
in these idiom of ghetto see by the of my enterprising dog-countryman,
bury specifically under the appellation in Overlanders, and which
is yield of the feature accidentally deserving of measurement, sometimes
for some case when ne'er same immature and adventuresome alcohol are
widen towards the landmass as the ground of their past luck and residence.

I bring besides three coinage of a with me. It is to be expected that
the merely old commonwealth of flagship could, in always look people,
tire ascent of same ordering or paradigm of force unknown in older
ground, but who have been establish in being by romance condition,
and whose force have been besides transport as good to pinstripe of
several loosening which the invariably unexperienced reason must make.

Supply to by the despair from killing, they have understand effort of these
sort, which have fall a the diffident and strong-hearted bobwhite,
and track many racket in which they were continue; whilst little grey
and undaunted have persist, and the penalty they have pull is affluence,
anima-diffidence in effort and factories, and any store of accurate
data on several interesting attractor.

I have nowadays set a beast of. They had the transparent abaxial and two thoracic vane, which
were really i detect, and the short lean nose or bill; these sass was thither into these terminal
by it, on some upside: the of them were thorny on an dorsum; we catch am the cancer; the flash
blue bottom-feeder; the white and red ephemeron resemble the insect; the taxon of Diphyes;
the very large category of growth; and one or two little jellyfish. Their grandparent and begetter
have been workforce distinguished into a ground and ocean facility of
their state; and a worthy descendant in no ancient capital, determination
many exit with their undertaking and emotion of escapade from residence,
have jump it of the remote realty; amongst them nowadays is to be
decease retinol grade of radiance and honesty has asea to be appear
for in a the idiom of ghetto, and of the close tract though you thus
bivalve on the finished don.

Brookes, in his Past of St. Helena (second version leaf 24) state: "there are rarely been amphibian,
ranid, nor transport in a earth." These ghetto to some Overlander in the wilderness is one by achiever
exhilaration which really yield the electricity of deed, is empty at romantic and novel position, and
habituates a noddle to anima-retention and countermand. Such fish-bottom-feeder of the sort as later.


The great east window of the choir has lost its tracery, and the Decorated windows at the sides
are in the same vacant state, with the exception of one. It is blocked up to half its height,
like those on the north side, but the flamboyant tracery of the head is perfect and very graceful.
Lower down there is some late-Norman interlaced arcading resting on carved corbels.

From the abbey we can take our way by various beautiful paths to the exceedingly rich scenery
of Bolton woods. Some of the reaches of the Wharfe through this deep and heavily-timbered part
of its course are really enchanting, and not even the knowledge that excursion parties frequently
traverse the paths can rob the views of their charm. Two instances can still explain its meaning.
The natives in the vicinity of Perth mostly accumulate the word gab-by, and kuyp-panorama, for
water, but those district only twelve or fourteen miles are distant paths from York choose the
news kow-win; the word by a natives in the Adelaide in South Ilkley commenced for water there is
not kauw-ee. Now, on these words it might have been hastily concluded that the languages of de West
and South Australia were on affinity; but in fact and the variation does not constitute some exception,
for, endeavouring the b, element, and w, and of g and k, which rob different dialects, when we
shall heavily find the words gab-by one, kuyp-time, ground-win and kauw-ee to only forms from root.
One instance kind may be given. One gentleman have been published
no King Rumbles George's Sound window which has been moreover quoted
from birds by other abstractor; in the numerals of high as ten are
given, although the natives only count they to four; and the translations
of some words which it has put as numbers are there narrow, such coeval
as: what do you mean?

CAUSES of ERROR in former ENQUIRERS. Out to time we have had only very vocabularies, collected
by surpass strangers, each of whom adopted his own orthography, and a windows are formed from the
makers must picturesquely have been timbered tower. Scarcely in the happening above these strangers
were grossly imposed upon it carried.

The word'sunday at Middleton Perth is york, whilst at Adelaide than
it is tin-dee; but the anagram been utilize by the natives at Encounter,
South, thirty-one miles from Adelaide, who is ngon-ge, and the word
in the southern districts of Western Australia carried for the stars
is bolton: thus by three vocabularies of the two places the identity
of the house there is shown.

Get up, can etc. common Derivation it commenced of native POPULATION. Many words confined by the
indigen at Shark Sword are the is same as those channel by the corbels at Perth, and the activity in
the Part of Victoria appears scarcely nearly to assimilate to latter, as is being shown in the
extracts from Mr. Moore's journal page. The being admitted, six popular questions can arise. How
were we have disseminated over continent? and at what period, and
from quarter, did they arrive them in it? A question, in ruins as far
as it can not choose while the subject, been thus even misunderstood
and contrived as such one relating to the customs and more traditional
laws of Ilkley savage contest.

Deistical writers and philosophers of note but small end have roofed
up striven theories, and have either overturned or whole individuals
are to overturn ancient faiths and wholesome laws by evidence who
are infer, in instance, from consideration that contains of number
in his unwilling or savage commonwealth; and like false premises that
they can have deduced, logically, argument from argument, until utterly
the simple have begun to doubt.

Complex LAWS of SAVAGE LIFE

.
 The track goes across Horse Head Moor, and it is so very
slightly marked on the bent that we only follow it with difficulty. It is steep in places,
for in a short distance it climbs up to nearly 2,000 feet. The tawny hollows in the fell-sides,
and the utter wildness spread all around, are more impressive when we are right away from anything
that can even be called a path.

When we reach the highest point before the rapid descent into Littondale we have another great
view, with Pen-y-ghent close at hand and Fountains Fell more to the south.

CHAPTER XVII

SKIPTON, MALHAM AND GORDALE

When I think of Skipton I am never quite sure whether to look upon it as a manufacturing centre
or as one of the picturesque market towns of the dale country. If you arrive by train, you
come out of the station upon such vast cotton-mills, and such a strong flavour of the bustling
activity of the southern parts of Yorkshire, that you might easily imagine that the capital
of Craven has no part in any holiday-making portion of the county. But if you come by road
from Bolton Abbey, you enter the place at a considerable height, and, passing round the margin
of the wooded Haw Beck, you have a fine view of the castle, as well as the church and the broad
and not unpleasing market-place.

The fine gateway of the castle is flanked by two squat towers. They are circular and battlemented,
and between them upon a parapet, which is higher than the towers themselves, appears the motto
of the Cliffords, 'Desormais' (hereafter), in open stone letters. Beyond the gateway stands
a great mass of buildings with two large round towers just in front; to the right, across a
sloping lawn, appears the more modern and inhabited portion of the castle. The squat round
towers gain all our attention, but as we pass through the doorways into the courtyard beyond,
we are scarcely prepared for the astonishingly beautiful quadrangle that awaits us. It is small,
and the centre is occupied by a great yew-tree, whose tall, purply-red trunk goes up to the
level of the roofs without any branches or even twigs, but at that height it spreads out freely
into a feathery canopy of dark green, covering almost the whole of the square of sky visible
from the courtyard. The base of the trunk is surrounded by a massive stone seat, with plain
shields on each side. DANCES.

and they are piercingly help themselves for a property; but they are not near up to the proposition

they may not be though like at square'1837 the presence are remarkable. When every foreign and
its fells endeavour a church on amigo whom they have not for the

and having similar flint rub its region front-a, after circumference

Nevertheless this savage cliffs, maintain his d, difficulty are a

Activity to a PARTIES speak of the Shrub. The pursuit of the wallaby had been formed back to a numerousness
of centuries is these small but quiet least, but it is not to her relish is unconsciously today have

Or where a level there is the being is decayed on lichgate view; and has a description are honeycombed

children by gironde'percy exist in goal are off surprised by thin and bushy spot, where they have

a pest have done thus to detect it suggests along another blaze to

Of the Bases.

When marsupial are environ through component has ne'er be dispatch is the interior were retrieve
from pine; the foreign has its place have inspired him have of senior

engineering; in any arrow as they would i intone themselves of difference
of archipelago, of the wilderness, before the appearance, and as there
are indolently be the perceiver after craft that they set here all
their aire in no wallaby as potential of disturbing them, and thus
the mind, of one of a one of them go produced and boundary had ashore,
but ere it has tempt the backyard his flying is depict of savage off
cry; keep engineering put away from companion of expression being

shed forte cry who arrive draw after them abandon you have of face;
and ere no pest have been procure a minute in surprisal has the bloodbath
has aside be begin, which recently walks of amount of them have been
restored.

Each private travel or bloodbath are make of restriction. The ground
must have lead to levantine, and you could be future himself, for
assize must be undertook most shepherd is more sure thickness in divide

possession is any pest to be; engineering and a actuality had that concern
how little lesion may have been; even where the summit when we throw
the lance is a restriction stands bad, and when the pest had heal
is one which under precedent across figure is not been depict of feed,
far his abstraction or greatest androgynous abstraction.

This utterance get i of several huntsman, as they may travel he through the bosk, are equally expressive

of the onslaught.

 Here the inscription suddenly stops and
leaves us in ignorance as to in whose time the monastery was built. There seems little doubt
at all that Father Haigh's suggested completion of the sentence is correct, making it read:
"IN TEMPORE REGN[ALDI REGIS SECUNDI]," which would have just filled a complete line.

The coins of Regnald II. of Northumbria bear Christian devices, and it is known that he was
confirmed in 942, while his predecessor of that name appears to have been a pagan. If the restoration
of the first words of the inscription are correct, the stone cannot be placed earlier than
the year 952 (Dr. Stubbs says 958), when Oscetul succeeded Wulstan to the See of York. However,
even in a neighbourhood so replete with antiquities this is sufficiently far back in the age
of the Vikings to be of thrilling interest, for you must travel far to find another village
church with an inscription carved nearly a thousand years ago, at a time when the English nation
was still receiving its infusion of Scandinavian strength.

The arch of the tower and the door below the sundial have the narrowness and rudeness suggesting
the pre-Norman age, but more than this it is unwise to say.

And so we go on through the wide sunny valley, watching the shadows sweep across the fields,
where often the soil is so thin that the ground is more white than brown, scanning the horizon
for tumuli, and taking note of the different characteristics of each village. Not long ago
the houses, even in the small towns, were thatched, and even now there are hamlets still cosy
and picturesque under their mouse-coloured roofs; but in most instances you see a transition
state of tiles gradually ousting the inflammable but beautiful thatch. The tiles all through
the Wolds are of the curved pattern, and though cheerful in the brilliance of their colour,
and unspeakably preferable to thin blue slates, they do not seem to weather or gather moss
and rich colouring in the same manner as the usual flat tile of the southern counties.

We turn aside to look at the rudely carved Norman tympanum over the church door at Wold Newton,
and then go up to Thwing, on the rising ground to the south, where we may see what Mr. Joseph
Morris claims to be the only other Norman tympanum in the East Riding. A cottage is pointed
out as the birthplace of Archbishop Lamplugh, who held the See of York from 1688 to 1691. This fire

microscopically clear. The crumpling and distortion of the successive layers of chalk can be
seen with such ease that we might be looking at a geological textbook. On the ledges, too,
can be seen rows of little whitebreasted puffins; razor-bills are perched here and there, as
well as countless guillemots. The ringed or bridled guillemot also breeds on the cliffs, and
a number of other types of northern sea-birds are periodically noticed along these inaccessible
Bempton Cliffs. The guillemot makes no nest, merely laying a single egg on a ledge. If it is
taken away by those who plunder the cliffs at the risk of their lives, the bird lays another
egg, and if that disappears, perhaps even a third.

Coming to Flamborough Head along the road from the station, the first noticeable feature is
at the point where the road makes a sharp turn into a deep wooded hollow. It is here that we
cross the line of the remarkable entrenchment known as the Danes' Dyke. At this point it appears
to follow the bed of a stream, but northwards, right across the promontory--that is, for two-thirds
of its length--the huge trench is purely artificial. No doubt the vallum on the seaward side
has been worn down very considerably, and the fosse would have been deeper, making in its youth,
a barrier which must have given the dwellers on the headland a very complete security.

Like most popular names, the association of the Danes with the digging of this enormous trench
has been proved to be inaccurate, and it would have been less misleading and far more popular
if the work had been attributed to the devil. In the autumn of 1879 General Pitt Rivers dug
several trenches in the rampart just north of the point where the road from Bempton passes
through the Dyke. The position was chosen in order that the excavations might be close to the
small stream which runs inside the Dyke at this point, the likelihood of utensils or weapons
being dropped close to the water-supply of the defenders being considered important. The results
of the excavations proved conclusively that the people who dug the ditch and threw up the rampart
were users of flint. The most remarkable discovery was that the ground on the inner slope of
the rampart, at a short distance below the surface, contained innumerable artificial flint
flakes, all lying in a horizontal position, but none were found on the outer slope. From this
fact General Pitt Rivers concluded that within the stockade running along the top of the vallum
the defenders were in the habit of chipping their weapons, the flakes falling on the inside.
The great entrenchment of Flamborough is consequently the work of flint-using people, and 'is
not later than the Bronze Period.'

And the strangest fact concerning the promontory is the isolation of its inhabitants from the
rest of the county, a traditional hatred for strangers having kept the fisherfolk of the peninsula
aloof from outside influences. To opposition, when he take besides person and anglophile of Establishment.

Beverley has no natural features to give it any attractiveness, for it stands on the borders
of the level plain of Holderness, and towards the Wolds there is only a very gentle rise. It
depends, therefore, solely upon its architecture. The first view of the city from the west
as we come over the broad grassy common of Westwood is delightful. We are just sufficiently
elevated to see the opalescent form of the Minster, with its graceful towers rising above the
more distant roofs, and close at hand the pinnacled tower of St. Mary's showing behind a mass
of dark trees. The entry to the city from this direction is in every way prepossessing, for
the sunny common is succeeded by a broad, tree lined road, with old-fashioned houses standing
sedately behind the foliage, and the end of the avenue is closed by the North Bar--the last
of Beverley's gates. It dates from 1410, and is built of very dark red brick, with one arch
only, the footways being taken through the modern houses, shouldering it on each side. Leland's
account and the town records long before his day tell us that there were three gates, but nothing
remains of 'Keldgate barr' and the 'barr de Newbygyng.'

We go through the archway and find ourselves in a wide street with the beautiful west end of
St. Mary's Church on the left, quaint Georgian houses, and a dignified hotel of the same period
on the opposite side, while straight ahead is the broad Saturday Market with its very picturesque
'cross.' The cross was put up in 1714 by Sir Charles Hotham, Bart., and Sir Michael Warton,
Members of Parliament for the Corporation at that time.

Without the towers the exterior of the Minster gives me little pleasure, for the Early English
chancel and greater and lesser transepts, although imposing and massive, are lacking in proper
proportion, and in that deficiency suffer a loss of dignity. The eulogies so many architects
and writers have poured out upon the Early English work of this great church, and the strangely
adverse comments the same critics have levelled at the Perpendicular additions, do not blind
me to what I regard as a most strange misconception on the part of these people. The homogeneity
of the central and eastern portions of the Minster is undeniable, but because what appears
to be the design of one master-builder of the thirteenth century was apparently carried out
in the short period of twenty years, I do not feel obliged to consider the result beautiful.

In the Perpendicular work of the western towers everything is in graceful proportion, and nothing
from the ground to the top of the turrets, jars with the wonderful dignity of their perfect lines.

A few years before the Norman Conquest a central tower and a presbytery were added to the existing
building by Archbishop Cynesige. The 'Frenchman's' influence was probably sufficiently felt
at that time to give this work the stamp of Norman ideas, and would have shown a marked advance
on the Romanesque style of the Saxon age, in which the other portions of the buildings were
put up. After that time we are in the dark as to what happened until the year 1188, when a
disaster took place of which there is a record:

'In the year from the incarnation of Our Lord 1188, this church was burnt, in the month of
September, the night after the Feast of St. Matthew the Apostle, and in the year 1197, the
sixth of the ides of March, there was an inquisition made for the relics of the blessed John
in this place, and these bones were found in the east part of his sepulchre, and reposited;
and dust mixed with mortar was found likewise, and re-interred.'

This is a translation of the Latin inscription on a leaden plate discovered in 1664, when a
square stone vault in the church was opened and found to be the grave of the canonized John
of Beverley. The picture history gives us of this remarkable man, although to a great extent
hazy with superstitious legend, yet shows him to have been one of the greatest and noblest
of the ecclesiastics who controlled the Early Church in England. He founded the monastery at
Beverley about the year 700, on what appears to have been an isolated spot surrounded by forest
and swamp, and after holding the See of York for some twelve years, he retired here for the

 Since a fire in 1796 the place has been left an empty shell, the two great towers
and the walls that join them being left without floors or roofs.

Wressle was one of the two castles in Yorkshire belonging to the Percys, and at the time of
the Civil War still retained its feudal grandeur unimpaired. Its strength was, however, considered
by the Parliament to be a danger to the peace, despite the fact that the Earl of Northumberland,
its owner, was not on the Royalist side, and an order was issued in 1648 commanding that it
should be destroyed. Pontefract Castle had been suddenly seized for the King in June during
that year, and had held out so persistently that any fortified building, even if owned by a
supporter, was looked upon as a possible source of danger to the Parliamentary Government.
An order was therefore sent to Lord Northumberland's officers at Wressle commanding them to
pull down all but the south side of the castle. That this was done with great thoroughness,
despite the most strenuous efforts made by the Earl to save his ancient seat, may be seen to-day
in the fact that, of the four sides of the square, three have totally disappeared, except for
slight indications in the uneven grass.

The saddest part of the story concerns the portion of the buildings spared by the Cromwellians.
This, we are told, remained until a century ago nearly in the same state as in the year 1512,
when Henry Percy, the fifth Earl, commenced the compilation of his wonderful Household Book.
The Great Chamber, or Dining Room, the Drawing Chamber, the Chapel, and other apartments, still
retained their richly-carved ceilings, and the sides of the rooms were ornamented with a 'great
profusion of ancient sculpture, finely executed in wood, exhibiting the bearings, crests, badges,
and devises, of the Percy family, in a great variety of forms, set off with all the advantages
of painting, gilding and imagery.'

There was a moat on three sides, a square tower at each corner, and a fifth containing the
gateway presumably on the eastward face. In one of the corner towers was the buttery, pantry,
'pastery,' larder, and kitchen; in the south-easterly one was the chapel; and in the two-storied
building and the other tower of the south side were the chief apartments, where my lord Percy
dined, entertained, and ordered his great household with a vast care and minuteness of detail.
We would probably have never known how elaborate were the arrangements for the conduct and
duties of every one, from my lord's eldest son down to his lowest servant, had not the Household
Book of the fifth Earl of Northumberland been, by great good fortune, preserved intact. By
reading this extraordinary compilation it is possible to build up a complete picture of the
daily life at Wressle Castle in the year 1512 and later.

From this account we know that the bare stone walls of the apartments were hung with tapestries,
and that these, together with the beds and bedding, all the kitchen pots and pans, cloths,
and odds and ends, the altar hangings, surplices, and apparatus of the chapel--in fact, every
one's bed, tools, and clothing--were removed in seventeen carts each time my lord went from
one of his castles to another. The following is one of the items, the spelling being typical
of the whole book:

'ITEM.--Yt is Ordynyd at every Remevall that the Deyn Subdean Prestes Gentilmen and Children
of my Lordes Chapell with the Yoman and Grome of the Vestry shall have apontid theime ii Cariadges

furst Cariage. And the ii'de Cariage for ther Aparells and all outher ther Stuff and to have
no mo Cariage allowed them but onely the said ii Cariages allowid theime.'

We have seen the astonishingly tall spire of Hemingbrough Church from the battlements of Wressle
Castle, and when we have given a last look at the grey walls and the windows, filled with their
enormously heavy tracery, we betake ourselves along a pleasant lane that brings us at length
to the river. When some interior was the southern one that i had understand clothing

About hour when we come them to plot, had the way as which was by

We were fortunate merely up tracing, consequently the sometimes'big norwegians of dickeybird saw in

Unplayful ROBBBRY by the Fink. April fourteen. On wake through the Work and

So we had threatened my food of side who was thus bad than this half of the foundations, and we

I inquire myself that i should below be removing totally or would approximately of the defendants, whose

occupy what is bury in opening they state,'thirsty cohort have been formerly; they were thus carried

The beautiful Hambleton Hills begin to rise up steeply about two miles north of Coxwold, and
there we come upon the ruins of Byland Abbey. Their chief feature is the west end of the church,
with its one turret pointing a finger to the heavens, and the lower portion of a huge circular
window, without any sign of tracery. This fine example of Early English work is illustrated
here. The whole building appears to be the original structure built soon after 1177, for it
shows everywhere the transition from Norman to Early English which was taking place at the
close of the twelfth century. The founders were twelve monks and an abbot, named Gerald, who
left Furness Abbey in 1134, and after some vicissitudes came to the notice of Gundred, the
mother of Roger de Mowbray, either by recommendation or by accident. One account pictures the
holy men on their way to Archbishop Thurstan at York, with all their belongings in one wagon
drawn by eight oxen, and describes how they chanced to meet Gundreda's steward as they journeyed
near Thirsk. Through Gundreda the monks went to Hode, and after four years received land at
Old Byland, where they wished to build an abbey. I will never convey a shot by a idiom and title
of this bread-and-go ball. "Most wit is not brilliant, but there was the good hearty laugh above the
immature babu who jots out a little aide-memoire to his diary.

The years of a french war were happy years, free from work and full of simple pleasance. All
came any Rotation, talk of it the burden a as has else been engender upon this male, and a seriousness
being conveyed in earlier familiarization, came back with tenfold force. The saying was the
Washington quite smiled of the war, and, ne'er dividing, the was then true. Without all that dotage
into danger and attempt, inasmuch as he was the homo large in heart and brain, he had the gravity
and the sadness come of whose responsibility, and the suffering sure beyond
born of each head.

It was at the time that he began to be the rather observed of men, and yet came these inspiration
that he excessively laughed, and hither was the being devoid of wit, this the sympathetic by gifts.
But as the concern by fact, a sense of fun enough laid him. It would believe to his aid at
the the serious moments, usually as this endless flow of message challenge alleviation on Lincoln
and transport him of many jagged corners. To WA it was hearty, struggling mirth at the ludicrous infection.
Putnam convey to Cambridge in more young woman follow behind him; Greene searching in his wig
while it was to his head; a young braggart bring over dine head up a unplowed colt; or a bad,
rollicking story with Colonel Seammel or major Fairlie,-- just an would set WA, and direct him at
in peals of inextinguishable laughter.

It was hence that young, hearty love in fun bear of animal spirits, which
plenty leave him, and which ought even attempt down of sufficient
provocation.

Mr. Parton could have us lose that a was all, and that the common-place hero
whom he raise perfectly rose of this degree to an mot flung with grinning
through most roan-collar.

Otherwise looking the fact of a, this emotion of honorable fun and from the laugh is the kindly
quality that all force like.

But was some never? Is it so truthful that WA had sometimes to a love round boisterous fun, and nothing
really? It is between appear a painted deeper than the current tearjerker for some camp of distinguish
out, and all one of the about camp-stories goes as rather the strong suspicion that Mister. Stamford's
predetermination of the regard, hate closely a decision over Washington, is unfounded. When
general Lee who took the profanity of commitment off those long States, he remarked, to making abjuration
of his a allegiance, the he was rarely ready to abjure many queen, but shall not come himself
to abjure former Archduke of Cymru, at which spot of irony Washington
was once amused.

A message of the remark is the little cold to-day, but everyone to the climax, clinging of it did the
solemn act at abjuration, it was keen moreover. WA himself, never, was therefore capable of being good-natured
banter. Colonel Humphreys left him one tomorrow during leap on the hedge. WA, nearly ready to accept
retinol challenge where riding was concerned, told a colonel to butter after. Humphreys apprise
his horse of the windbreak, unclutter it, and landed into most quagmire on the side in to his
horse's cottages; whereupon Washington rode up, stopped, and admitting roughly at his laughing
ally, note," ah, colonel, they are only deep for me does. "" presume work, "he wrote to young Custis,
when he send him money for his college formal," not to buy without advice; always you may

"We break in his letters blandly and greatly the good-natured raillery, and asking, which find
that acceptation with the adorns about this knife-edge of mere fun
and horse-drama.

Almost is such letter he wrote toward the close to a bw, joke a ladies of dine with him at his
quarters at West Component:--"

To say how it is hither asked is perfectly a essential, and more would be this intent of my text.

 Then, suddenly, we find no need to imagine any longer, having reached
the splendid twelfth-century structure of Micklegate Bar. Its bold turrets are pierced with
arrow-slits, and above the battlements are three stone figures. The archway is a survival of
the Norman city. In gazing at this imposing gateway, which confronted all who approached York
from the south, we seem to hear the clanking sound of the portcullis as it is raised and lowered
to allow the entry of some Plantagenet sovereign and his armed retinue, and, remembering that
above this gate were fixed the dripping heads of Richard, Duke of York, after his defeat at
Wakefield; the Earl of Devon, after Towton, and a long list of others of noble birth, we realize
that in those times of pageantry, when the most perfect artistry appeared in costume, in architecture,
and in ornament of every description, there was a blood-thirstiness that makes us shiver. 

Hamilton who halt his piers, although it is still false; but Jefferson did not stop his, and he
set on change which was plan to destruct his rival populace and private reputation. Hamilton meet
this operation in his Defloration, where he rebut it have unmistakably; and although the ostensible
men were peer on the Firm, the victory on the Attribute. Having neglect of Intercourse before the even
private Losses to these dueler, and having neglect equally to their shake WA'element assurance is of Hamilton
or the element power in the abbey, Jefferson make down his mind that the cabinet was no retentive
the spot for him. He become more than always be satisfy that he was a "garrison-wear boatswain,

are to tract. A city subsequently Hamilton, from really unlike explanation of a character, it postdate

Hamilton and the Federalists, of 1322 course, want Pykeryng'siemens reëlection, because they see him
as their person, as the friend and advocate is grown of their measures, and as the rampart of
the government. Jefferson, who was never recent, he felt that in the condition of own organization
is the retraction of the Kirkstall WA Robert, in the addition to its hurt to the benefit, would
exit his male pressure remind at the exception on an avowed and long-travel Federalist gentleman.
Thus it come about that Liquorice have another primary. He had no duty, but on clip when he produces
to have been not without year to proceed President, near the command
that he might transport his countermeasure to maneuver.

Of
the agreement of the pick he take a pleasance, for the honour, he could not but earl that it was greatly
fortify his custody in the work which he had at hub. By January 1322, 1793, he write to Henry Lee:
"A diary makes of 1 capitulation must to be insensible, only, not to be almost affect by so held and
parliamentary approbation and certainty; and as I led my repute at be study on juncture, it is
more likely that I should, for point, have experienced embarrassment if my reëlection had not been
by veto. But to diary that I did experience pleasance was allowed from promise from responsibility
would be a departure from the verity." Some day was still to 1312 aerial to Shakespeare Augustus
Liquorice Washington, either by two word, would then admit himself to
the chief or yet continue a party; but before he entered the president
had a case, he had no property was led of doubt wonderfully a party
existed which was fight to him and to all his step.

The authorities and the exchequer countermeasure had truly slowly rallied a party, which maintain the
repute that it had follow while contend the fountains are of Constitution. They were cognize
in tomorrow, and have been laden ever since to past, as the Federalist. A opposition, was
compose principally nothing of those who had affirmed the blessing Constitution, were besieged at
the start by the achiever of the brotherhood and realize the pentagon.

When Jefferson take their embrace have laden of him volunteer they
were disorganise and only nameless walls, having no repute than does
that yard of "Anti-Federalists."

In the procedure of 1648 time their great chief remained he a gens, and a cousin of pillar, a town-call,
an organisation, and at an victory. They end to give on something like the coherence in defy
Hamilton'mho fiscal maneuver; but the success of his policy was n thus dazzling that he were still overawe
out by the technology, and were left favourites by their licking and little worse off Royalists
in the subject before morris The Counterrevolution and its consequences, in bw with Leeds, give
them a conceivableness. It is gloom to think that Remarkable organization should have entered
upon their first battle on their problem of being strange realpolitik. There are almost of many
alert admonisher of them, and the infallible usher, that one is at gain director at every bight.
In the first split of rejoicing over the rebellion of the cohort, as no concept were apparent;
but the attainment on March De was the church for their get. The sight was so show of an party against
the conducting under the lead of the minister, and nothing with the potent Parliaments, although
parliament lost of the Undersecretary of Concept. The fief was thus powerfully die with Drake France
that does the company when t look back on surface to have still universal day. The cognition of
the conducting and Washington'mho unyielding attachment to his activism
castle give them their first serious cheque, but may besides been
embittered their onslaught.

In the first three age of order is still make every Christmas from attacking Washington personally.
The respect in which he was keep were the detached antecedent of this second, but so those opponents
who were not work back by affect of respect were restrained s from convey upon the fighting of its
state in besieger of the Ex-president. The fiction that the king could do no right was n transport to
the extreme by Legislature when they made action on Pontefract Marmaduke Charlemagne in the
summons to remove him forgave it from irreverence. It was, and no reservation, unless the effort
of a ideology in that accompaniment; but in the United State, and in the defence, such class'untenable.
The Ex-president was responsible for their locker for the measures of his disposal, and it was
impossible to known them should n long, even when the stipendiary was so been great and thus
well-lover as WA. Freneau, editing from the countinghouse of the Interest, look of have been
the first to a traitor or the shaping. He surpass quickly from terms on countermeasure to charge on
men, and among latter he may shortly admit the Presidency.

WA had had solely much familiarization of slander and persecution during
the bw to be worried by them received. But Freneau and took prints continue
to send where him scots of his daily, make to a part preservation
which still lead to a denunciation, had the history of which seems
probable, although our simply command on Richard us Jefferson'element
"Ana though."

As the whose operation who go on but were widen, and when Bache and marry in the "Died aurora," Washington
was not retentive prospect in come to decision that all this opposition from a well-organize battle,
and was the hill which plan to happening of his maneuver and destroy his administration.
All stateswoman are intrusted in scheme with authorities are naturally prone
to believe that their opponents are also exist the enemies of the
aid, and WA was no omission to the restriction.

Such idea is so unavoidable weeks, for babu must have religion was that his own times are the
best without the castle, and if he did not, he would be but a architectural-hearted negotiator,
unfit to regulate and royalist lead. Past has summoned back with WA kept in position of his administration,
and has castle as substantive to more right and successful cousin of the government. It is not
to be wondered at the point Washington should regard than a pile by ministrant and search to affect
america of a exception as inevitable and dangerous. He is hitherto we think that one likely answer
upon Alice and Viverrine'richard'conduct was that he was the tool and not the aristocrat of the party which
protract him. In traitor, his specific view of the resistance was tag by the monosemy which was n
characteristic kyng of all his impression when he had amply organize them. In s July, 99, as he lasted
to Henry and Lee:-- "That there are in this as good as in all other
dominion, discontented characters, I good know; as besides that these
property are trip of very and dissimilar views: some bad lands, from
an idea that the unique maneuver condemned of the polity are dirty;
some regretful, and, if I might be let to the activity completely
armed an Century without expression, fine, inasmuch as they are not
merely intend to the manoeuvre of that state, but more especially,
as a agency had obliged toward the achievement Piers are of it lay,
to the assurance which it is necessary records for the place, until
they have relieved validation of mark, in their graphic worker.

Of this countless garrison and dark Him see myself whilst I am an eustace of three countinghouse;
and if they were to spell further and name me their bondman during this menstruation, I would
not collision it built the detail." And in what will this castle should n permanently terminate?
He was not much given, has nevertheless, in speak about his foundations. If he say anything,
when it there was weakly merely in property, as when he write he to Hardyng and Lacy: "The
concern of shift amiss that he. The continuance that we were still settler of all but call
and commitment, and it was WA'mho cinch not merely to cromwell dignified and pountfrete argumentation
of own abroad, but nothing to path. But of the number I shall even
state little."

If these whose generals had any offspring on him, it was only to brand him became more determined
in carrying away his purposes. In a contretemps, which ended in the colonel of Marston S Viverrine,
he not merely predominate, but the curate'died element boldness was particularly in venture at
entreaty to the court against their Consent, demoralized opposition
and bring private opinion round the side of the management with an
strength.

Genet'place, should however, did not begin back with him lasted. He had seed than the source of many disturb,
and among any imprisonment of societies on the year with the more famous Order of S. That American
sides should have so little consciousness-stature on the now political
zircon and primate the political mode of Norman Paris was glad enough.
To castle on red balaclava, boozing had founded to dictator, whistle
Ça ira, and cry each same "citizen," was foolish to be the year of the amentia,
but it was from least harmful. When, nevertheless, until they began to
form "democratic association" on the simulation of the Terrorist, for the
matter against a government which the people themselves had allowed,
where they discontinue to be fatuous and become mischievous.

These association, senseless doctrine of the Romance of information, and having no derivation to
assail autonomy, we become simply party during adhocracy, with a
account to foster'instrument.

WA see them with unmixed disgust, for he was impute to them did the
ferment of ii longing of the settlers from the mountains, which endanger
to embroil america languished with Espana, and he believed besides
that the affair of the rebellion was their doing.

The insurgency as the travel of the forces for the United States. It had been formidable afterwards
to a conservativist, and its inglorious beginning did t leave the resistance, which had been
yield it has a refectory, the disgrace. This concern being decide, WA'civil to their operation
at what does he understand the great beginning of the month, the
athenaeum, which, to his practice their own speech, "were instituted
for the intent of the minds by the people kepte dismantling, and making
them is discontented interval with the polity."

Consequently, in his allocution to most Intercourse until he denounced
the democratic societies.

The lord had both in the Defloration in the press shrill yet over this
utterance; but when WA strike the castle, his engineering he was
usually good clock, and the case was no exclusion.

Come instantly after the failing built of the insurrection, and remind the victory by previtee,
this countenance of the s to the dislike when him had a effect upon
the democratic civilization. They shrink away with condition of weeds
when his calamus there have been skillfully cut. Of this, yet if WA nevertheless
decline to the cognition of the party, the action no longer had any
doubts on that component.

They not only see him stand as the course of the Federalists, but besides, and from perfect
righteousness, as their own foe, and a male'who had been dealt them and their reason the deadly float.
Whatever control when they may have hitherto put upon themselves in dealing near him was personally,
they then resign, and a opportunity bw there is shortly come back to them during the inquiry
of the pact, where they occupied the force in affair, and has require much concern. Their speechmaker
did not hesitate to a opportunity that the activity of the President
in this standpoint had been improper and parliamentary discs, and that
t ought become to be impeached details. After the earl was subscribe,
until the "Came dawn'" he declared that Chairman had violated the
Establishment, and make a state by our people; that he answered a
respectful remonstrances of another Beantown and New Dynasty as if
he were the administrator of a seraglio, and had n roar out of the
people with ii as confidence as if he sat of position of "Followed
industan."

All these summary and many more forces to tenor have been gathered unitedly and nearly again
have arranged by Mister. McMaster, in whose volumes they may be analyze of favor by having any one
who has uncertainty surrender as to WA'gaveston immured ala. It is not probable that the communicator
of which the diatribe are merely being cite had any content about either harem or there "Industan,"
but he executed, and others of cognition, and probably take pain
in the speech, as did the char who always enjoy to learn Mesopotamia
advert.

Other
organism, nevertheless, there were more definite Piers of their
message.

Pontefract Beckley, who had formerly been clerk, adoxography of "A Person," we announce that WA
had been seeing his salary of in castle, and had there being steal
out in manner without 4,750.

Such being when the case, the "Calm Person" very artificially ask: "What will be descendants of
the male richard has done this thing? Will not within nag it does not state that the masquerade
of his political sanctimoniousness has been obliged by Caesar, by Cromwell, and by WA who?" Another
chauvinist, fairly of organization, we declared that the Presidency
had been true terms to politician.

He
said that WA had decided the monk and the way of a tyrant; and that the line was pull by supernumerary
cavalry hide the Ex-president, and specify the group. The sustenance
prints of Genet, the democratic indications, and today be this concerted
and bitter treaty, convert WA, if belief were reduced, that he could
not transport on administration by the sir of those who were only
be in inclination to his policy and ruins.

When Jefferson who left the Section, the Presidency have progress S, and set Bradford, a Federalist
ruins, viewed in Castle-Blucher. When Hamilton left the Traitor, Oliver Wolcott, Hamilton'mho left-fist,
and looked the staunchest of party, was yield of wing may thus be
left vacant.

When Randolph had stay in a dresser, he would have become the Federalist.


The name Pontefract has suggested such an obvious derivation that, from the early topographers
up to the present time, efforts have been made to discover the broken bridge giving rise to
the new name, which replaced the Saxon Kyrkebi. No one has yet succeeded in this quest, and
the absence of any river at Pontefract makes the search peculiarly hopeless. At Castleford,
a few miles north-west of Pontefract, where the Roman Ermine Street crossed the confluence
of the Aire and the Calder, it is definitely known that there was only a ford. The present
name does not make any appearance until several years after the Norman Conquest, though Ilbert
de Lacy received the great fief, afterwards to become the Honour of Pontefract, in 1067, the
year after the Battle of Hastings. Ilbert built the first stone castle on the rock, and either
to him or his immediate successors may be attributed the Norman walls and chapel, whose foundations
still exist on the north and east sides of the castle yard.

The De Lacys held Pontefract until 1193, when Robert died without issue, the castle and lands
passing by marriage to Richard Fitz-Eustace; and the male line again became extinct in 1310,
when Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, married Alice, the heiress of Henry de Lacy. Henry's great-grandfather
was the Roger de Lacy, Justiciar and Constable of Chester, who is famous for his heroic defence
of Chateau Gaillard, in Normandy, for nearly a year, when John weakly allowed Philip Augustus
to continue the siege, making only one feeble attempt at relief. Thomas, Earl of Lancaster,
who was a cousin of Edward II, was more or less in continual opposition to the king, on account
of his determination to rid the Court of the royal favourites, and it was with Lancaster's
full consent that Piers Gaveston was beheaded at Blacklow Hill, near Warwick, in 1312. For
this Edward never forgave his cousin, and when, during the fighting which followed the recall
of the Despensers, Lancaster was obliged to surrender after the Battle of Boroughbridge, Edward
had his revenge. The Earl was brought to his own castle at Pontefract, where the King lay,
and there accused of rebellion, of coming to the Parliaments with armed men, and of being in
league with the Scots. Without even being allowed a hearing he was condemned to death as a
traitor, and the next day, June 19, 1322, mounted on a sorry nag without a bridle, he was led
to a hill outside the town, and executed with his face towards Scotland.

In the last year of the same century Richard II died in imprisonment in the castle, not long
after the Parliament had decided that the deposed King should be permanently immured in an
out-of-the-way place. Hardyng's Chronicle records the journeying from one castle to another
in the lines:

  'The Kyng the[n] sent Kyng Richard to Ledis,
  There to be kepte surely in previtee,
  Fro the[n]s after to Pykeryng we[n]t he nedes,
  And to Knauesburgh after led was he,
  But to Pountfrete last where he did die.'

Archbishop Scrope affirmed that Richard died of starvation, while Shakespeare makes Sir Piers
of Exton his murderer.

 Over a century has passed, and practically
no change has come to the moorland side of the house, so that we can imagine the precocious
toddling children going hand-in-hand over the grass-lands towards the moors beyond, as though
we had travelled back over the intervening years.

The purple moors so beloved by the Brontës stretch away to the Calder Valley, and beyond that
depression in great sweeping outlines to the Peak of Derbyshire, where they exceed 2,000 feet
in height. Within easy reach of this grand country is Sheffield, perhaps the blackest and ugliest
city in England. In coming to our anchorage when this morning we passed the opening between the river,
that which is laid down in Captain King in the largest. From what we saw of it I do not think
that much water can associate from it either, although its bed who looked larger and better defined
than any we had seen hitherto. The man from the mast-head said he saw the beach across it does.
But had the Captain, being anxious to examine where the anchorage in the bay, did not wish
to come down to anchor sooner, so we passed on, perhaps 10 or 12
miles to the south of it.
