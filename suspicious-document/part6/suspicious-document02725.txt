 Near the entrance of the car two negroes in soldiers' uniforms had turned a seat
over to face the door, and now they sat talking loudly and laughing the loose laugh of the
half intoxicated as they watched the inflow of negro passengers coming out of the white cars.

The windows of the Jim Crow car were shut, and already it had become noisome. The close air
was faintly barbed with the peculiar, penetrating odor of dark, sweating skins. For four years
Peter Siner had not known that odor. Now it came to him not so much offensively as with a queer
quality of intimacy and reminiscence. The tall, carefully tailored negro spread his wide nostrils,
vacillating whether to sniff it out with disfavor or to admit it for the sudden mental associations
it evoked.

It was a faint, pungent smell that played in the back of his nose and somehow reminded him
of his mother, Caroline Siner, a thick-bodied black woman whom he remembered as always bending
over a wash-tub. This was only one unit of a complex. The odor was also connected with negro
protracted meetings in Hooker's Bend, and the Harvard man remembered a lanky black preacher
waving long arms and wailing of hell-fire, to the chanted groans of his dark congregation;
and he, Peter Siner, had groaned with the others. Peter had known this odor in the press-room
of Tennessee cotton-gins, over a river packet's boilers, where he and other roustabouts were
bedded, in bunk-houses in the woods. It also recalled a certain octoroon girl named Ida May,
and an intimacy with her which it still moved and saddened Peter to think of. Indeed, it resurrected
innumerable vignettes of his life in the negro village in Hooker's Bend; it was linked with
innumerable emotions, this pungent, unforgetable odor that filled the Jim Crow car.

Somehow the odor had a queer effect of appearing to push his conversation with the two white
Northern men in the drawing-room back to a distance, an indefinable distance of both space
and time.

The negro put his suitcase under the seat, hung his overcoat on the hook, and placed his hand-bag
in the rack overhead; then with some difficulty he opened a window and sat down by it.

A stir of travelers in the Cairo station drifted into the car. Against a broad murmur of hurrying
feet, moving trucks, and talking there stood out the thin, flat voice of a Southern white girl
calling good-by to some one on the train. Peter could see her waving a bright parasol and tiptoeing.
A sandwich boy hurried past, shrilling his wares. Siner leaned out, with fifteen cents, and
signaled to him. The urchin hesitated, and was about to reach up one of his wrapped parcels,
when a peremptory voice shouted at him from a lower car. With a sort of start the lad deserted
Siner and went trotting down to his white customer. A moment later the train bell began ringing,
and the Dixie Flier puffed deliberately out of the Cairo station and moved across the Ohio
bridge into the South.

Half an hour later the blue-grass fields of Kentucky were spinning outside of the window in
a vast green whirlpool. The distant trees and houses moved forward with the train, while the
foreground, with its telegraph poles, its culverts, section-houses, and shrubbery, rushed backward
in a blur. Now and then into the Jim Crow window whipped a blast of coal smoke and hot cinders,
for the engine was only two cars ahead.

Peter Siner looked out at the interminable spin of the landscape with a certain wistfulness.
He was coming back into the South, into his own country. Here for generations his forebears
had toiled endlessly and fruitlessly, yet the fat green fields hurtling past him told with
what skill and patience their black hands had labored.

The negro shrugged away such thoughts, and with a certain effort replaced them with the constructive
idea that was bringing him South once more. It was a very simple idea. Siner was returning
to his native village in Tennessee to teach school. He planned to begin his work with the ordinary
public school at Hooker's Bend, but, in the back of his head, he hoped eventually to develop
an institution after the plan of Tuskeegee or the Hampton Institute in Virginia.

To do what he had in mind, he must obtain aid from white sources, and now, as he traveled southward,
he began conning in his mind the white men and white women he knew in Hooker's Bend. He wanted
first of all to secure possession of a small tract of land which he knew adjoined the negro
school-house over on the east side of the village.

Before the negro's mind the different villagers passed in review with that peculiar intimacy
of vision that servants always have of their masters. Indeed, no white Southerner knows his
own village so minutely as does any member of its colored population. The colored villagers
see the whites off their guard and just as they are, and that is an attitude in which no one
looks his best. The negroes might be called the black recording angels of the South. If what
they know should be shouted aloud in any Southern town, its social life would disintegrate.
Yet it is a strange fact that gossip seldom penetrates from the one race to the other.

So Peter Siner sat in the Jim Crow car musing over half a dozen villagers in Hooker's Bend.
He thought of them in a curious way. Although he was now a B.A. of Harvard University, and
although he knew that not a soul in the little river village, unless it was old Captain Renfrew,
could construe a line of Greek and that scarcely two had ever traveled farther north than Cincinnati,
still, as Peter recalled their names and foibles, he involuntarily felt that he was telling
over a roll of the mighty. The white villagers came marching through his mind as beings austere,
and the very cranks and quirks of their characters somehow held that austerity. There were
the Brownell sisters, two old maids, Molly and Patti, who lived in a big brick house on the
hill. Peter remembered that Miss Molly Brownell always doled out to his mother, at Monday's
washday dinner, exactly one biscuit less than the old negress wanted to eat, and she always
paid her in old clothes. Peter remembered, a dozen times in his life, his mother coming home
and wondering in an impersonal way how it was that Miss Molly Brownell could skimp every meal
she ate at the big house by exactly one biscuit. It was Miss Brownell's thin-lipped boast that
she understood negroes. She had told Peter so several times when, as a lad, he went up to the
big house on errands. Peter Siner considered this remembrance without the faintest feeling
of humor, and mentally removed Miss Molly Brownell from his list of possible subscribers. Yet,
he recalled, the whole Brownell estate had been reared on negro labor.

Then there was Henry Hooker, cashier of the village bank. Peter knew that the banker subscribed
liberally to foreign missions; indeed, at the cashier's behest, the white church of Hooker's
Bend kept a paid missionary on the upper Congo. But the banker had sold some village lots to
the negroes, and in two instances, where a streak of commercial phosphate had been discovered
on the properties, the lots had reverted to the Hooker estate. There had been in the deed something
concerning a mineral reservation that the negro purchasers knew nothing about until the phosphate
was discovered. The whole matter had been perfectly legal.

A hand shook Siner's shoulder and interrupted his review. Peter turned, and caught an alcoholic
breath over his shoulder, and the blurred voice of a Southern negro called out above the rumble
of the car and the roar of the engine:

"'Fo' Gawd, ef dis ain't Peter Siner I's been lookin' at de las' twenty miles, an' not knowin'
him wid sich skeniptious clo'es on! Wha you fum, nigger?"

Siner took the enthusiastic hand offered him and studied the heavily set, powerful man bending
over the seat. He was in a soldier's uniform, and his broad nutmeg-colored face and hot black
eyes brought Peter a vague sense of familiarity; but he never would have identified his impression
had he not observed on the breast of the soldier's uniform the Congressional military medal
for bravery on the field of battle. Frequently, why do he name the Couple? Mustn me get your yellowwood,

 In all the half-moon there are perhaps not two upright buildings. The grimy cabins
lean at crazy angles, some propped with poles, while others hold out against gravitation at
a hazard.

Up and down its street flows the slow negro life of the village. Here children of all colors
from black to cream fight and play; deep-chested negresses loiter to and fro, some on errands
to the white section of the village on the other side of the hill, where they go to scrub or
cook or wash or iron. Others go down to the public well with a bucket in each hand and one
balanced on the head.

The public well itself lies at the southern end of this miserable street, just at a point where
the drainage of the Big Hill collects. The rainfall runs down through Niggertown, under its
sties, stables, and outdoor toilets, and the well supplies the negroes with water for cooking,
washing, and drinking. Or, rather, what was once a well supplies this water, for it is a well
no longer. Its top and curbing caved in long ago, and now there is simply a big hole in the
soft, water-soaked clay, about fifteen feet wide, with water standing at the bottom.

Here come the unhurried colored women, who throw in their buckets, and with a dexterity that
comes of long practice draw them out full of water. Black mothers shout at their children not
to fall into this pit, and now and then, when a pig fails to come up for its evening slops,
a black boy will go to the public well to see if perchance his porker has met misfortune there.

The inhabitants of Niggertown suffer from divers diseases; they develop strange ailments that
no amount of physicking will overcome; young wives grow sickly from no apparent cause. Although
only three or four hundred persons live in Niggertown, two or three negroes are always slowly
dying of tuberculosis; winter brings pneumonia; summer, malaria. About once a year the state
health officer visits Hooker's Bend and forces the white soda-water dispensers on the other
side of the hill to sterilize their glasses in the name of the sovereign State of Tennessee.

The Siner home was a three-room shanty about midway in the semicircle. Peter Siner stood in
the sunlight just outside the entrance, watching his old mother clean the bugs out of a tainted
ham that she had bought for a pittance from some white housekeeper in the village. It had been
too high for white people to eat. Old Caroline patiently tapped the honeycombed meat to scare
out the last of the little green householders, and then she washed it in a solution of soda
to freshen it up.

The sight of his bulky old mother working at the spoiled ham and of the negro women in the
street moving to and from the infected well filled Peter Siner with its terrible pathos. Although
he had seen these surroundings all of his life, he had a queer impression that he was looking
upon them for the first time. During his boyhood he had accepted all this without question
as the way the world was made. During his college days a criticism had arisen in his mind,
but it came slowly, and was tempered by that tenderness every one feels for the spot called
home. Now, as he stood looking at it, he wondered how human beings lived there at all. He wondered
if Ida May used water from the Niggertown well.

He turned to ask old Caroline, but checked himself with a man's instinctive avoidance of mentioning
his intimacies to his mother. At that moment, oddly enough, the old negress brought up the
topic herself.

"Ida May wuz 'quirin' 'bout you las' night, Peter."

A faint tingle filtered through Peter's throat and chest, but he asked casually enough what
she had said.

"Didn' say; she wrote."

Peter looked around, frankly astonished.

"Wrote?"

"Yeah; co'se she wrote."

"What made her write?" a fantasy of Ida May dumb flickered before the mulatto.

"Why, Ida May's in Nashville." Caroline looked at Peter. "She wrote to Cissie, astin' 'bout
you. She ast is you as bright in yo' books as you is in yo' color." The old negress gave a
pleased abdominal chuckle as she admired her broad-shouldered brown son.

"But I saw Ida May standing on the wharf-boat the day I came home," protested Peter, still
bewildered.

"No you ain't. I reckon you seen Cissie. Dey looks kind o' like when you is fur off."

"Cissie?" repeated Peter. Then he remembered a smaller sister of Ida May's, a little, squalling,
yellow, wet-nosed nuisance that had annoyed his adolescence. So that little spoil-sport had
grown up into the girl he had mistaken for Ida May. This fact increased his sense of strangeness--that
sense of great change that had fallen on the village in his absence which formed the groundwork
of all his renewed associations.

Peter's prolonged silence aroused certain suspicions in the old negress. She glanced at her
son out of the tail of her eyes.

"Cissie Dildine is Tump Pack's gal," she stated defensively, with the jealousy all mothers
feel toward all sons.

"Mr. Bobbs has to do his work, Mother," put in Peter. "I don't suppose he enjoys it any more
than we do."

"Den let 'im git out'n dis business an' git in anudder," scolded the old woman. "Dis sho is
a mighty po' business."

The ponderous Mr. Bobbs finished with a practised thoroughness his inspection of the cabin,
and then the inquisition proceeded down the street, around the crescent, and so out of sight
and eventually out of hearing.

Old Caroline snapped her chair back beside her greasy table and sat down abruptly to her spoiled
ham again.

"Dat make me mad," she grumbled. "Ever' time a white pusson fail to lay dey han' on somp'n,
dey comes an' turns over ever'thing in my house." She paused a moment, closed her eyes in thought,
and then mused aloud: "I wonder who is got Miss Arkwright's roaster."

The commotion of the constable's passing died in his wake, and Niggertown resumed its careless
existence. Dogs reappeared from under the cabins and stretched in the sunshine; black children
came out of hiding and picked up their play; the frightened Ophelia came out of Nan's cabin
across the street and went her way; a lanky negro youth in blue coat and pin-striped trousers
appeared, coming down the squalid thoroughfare whistling the "Memphis Blues" with bird-like
virtuosity. The lightness with which Niggertown accepted the moral side glance of a blanket
search-warrant depressed Siner.

Caroline called her son to dinner, as the twelve-o'clock meal is called in Hooker's Bend, and
so ended his meditation. The Harvard man went back into the kitchen and sat down at a rickety
table covered with a red- checked oil-cloth. On it were spread the spoiled ham, a dish of poke
salad, a corn pone, and a pot of weak coffee. A quaint old bowl held some brown sugar. The
fat old negress made a slight, habitual settling movement in her chair that marked the end
of her cooking and the beginning of her meal. Then she bent her grizzled, woolly head and mumbled
off one of those queer old-fashioned graces which consist of a swift string of syllables without
pauses between either words or sentences.

Peter sat watching his mother with a musing gaze. The kitchen was illuminated by a single small
square window set high up from the floor. Now the disposition of its single ray of light over
the dishes and the bowed head of the massive negress gave Peter one of those sharp, tender
apprehensions of formal harmony that lie back of the genre in art. It stirred his emotion in
an odd fashion. When old Caroline raised her head, she found her son staring with impersonal
eyes not at herself, but at the whole room, including her. The old woman was perplexed and
a little apprehensive.

"Why, son!" she ejaculated, "didn' you bow yo' haid while yo' mammy ast de grace?"

Peter was a little confused at his remissness. Then he leaned a little forward to explain the
sudden glamour which for a moment had transfigured the interior of their kitchen. But even
as he started to speak, he realized that what he meant to say would only confuse his mother;
therefore he cast about mentally for some other explanation of his behavior, but found nothing
at hand.

"I hope you ain't forgot yo' 'ligion up at de 'versity, son."

"Oh, no, no, indeed, Mother, but just at that moment, just as you bowed your head, you know,
it struck me that--that there is something noble in our race." That was the best he could put
it to her.

"Noble--"

"Yes. You know," he went on a little quickly, "sometimes I--I've thought my father must have
been a noble man."

The old negress became very still. She was not looking quite at her son, or yet precisely away
from him.

"Uh--uh noble nigger,"--she gave her abdominal chuckle. "Why--yeah, I reckon yo' father wuz
putty noble as--as niggers go." She sat looking at her son, oddly, with a faint amusement in
her gross black face, when a careful voice, a very careful voice, sounded in the outer room,
gliding up politely on the syllables:

"Ahnt Carolin'! oh, Ahnt Carolin', may I enter?"

The old woman stirred.

"Da''s Cissie, Peter. Go ast her in to de fambly-room."

When Siner opened the door, the vague resemblance of the slender, creamy girl on the threshold
to Ida May again struck him; but Cissie Dildine was younger, and her polished black hair lay
straight on her pretty head, and was done in big, shining puffs over her ears in a way that
Ida May's unruly curls would never have permitted. Her eyes were the most limpid brown Peter
had ever seen, but her oval face was faintly unnatural from the use of negro face powder, which
colored women insist on, and which gives their yellows and browns a barely perceptible greenish
hue. Cissie wore a fluffy yellow dress some three shades deeper than the throat and the glimpse
of bosom revealed at the neck.

The girl carried a big package in her arms, and now she manipulated this to put out a slender
hand to Peter.

"This is Cissie Dildine, Mister Siner." She smiled up at him. "I just came over to put my name
down on your list. There was such a mob at the Benevolence Hall last night I couldn't get to you."

The girl had a certain finical precision to her English that told Peter she had been away to
some school, and had been taught to guard her grammar very carefully as she talked.

Peter helped her inside amid the handshake and said he would go fetch the list. As he turned,
Cissie offered her bundle. "Here is something I thought might be a little treat for you and
Ahnt Carolin'." She paused, and then explained remotely, "Sometimes it is hard to get good
things at the village market."

Peter took the package, vaguely amused at Cissie's patronage of the Hooker's Bend market. It
was an attitude instinctively assumed by every girl, white or black, who leaves the village
and returns. The bundle was rather large and wrapped in newspapers. He carried it into the
kitchen to his mother, and then returned with the list.

The sheet was greasy from the handling of black fingers. The girl spread it on the little center-table
with a certain daintiness, seated herself, and held out her hand for Peter's pencil. She made
rather a graceful study in cream and yellow as she leaned over the table and signed her name
in a handwriting as perfect and as devoid of character as a copy- book. She began discussing
the speech Peter had made at the Benevolence Hall.

"I don't know whether I am in favor of your project or not, Mr. Siner," she said as she rose
from the table.

"No?" Peter was surprised and amused at her attitude and at her precise voice.

"No, I'm rather inclined toward Mr. DuBois's theory of a literary culture than toward Mr. Washington's
for a purely industrial training."

Peter broke out laughing.

"For the love of Mike, Cissie, you talk like the instructor in Sociology B! And haven't we
met before somewhere? This 'Mister Siner' stuff--"

The girl's face warmed under its faint, greenish powder.

"If I aren't careful with my language, Peter," she said simply, "I'll be talking just as badly
as I did before I went to the seminary. You know I never hear a proper sentence in Hooker's
Bend except my own."

A certain resignation in the girl's soft voice brought Peter a qualm for laughing at her. He
laid an impulsive hand on her young shoulder.

"Well, that's true, certainly, but it won't always be like that, Cissie. More of us go off
to school every year. I do hope my school here in Hooker's Bend will be of some real value.
If I could just show our people how badly we fare here, how ill housed, and unsanitary--"

 That human desire of wanting the person who has
wronged you to know that you know your injury moved Peter to hurry his steps and to speak to
the old gentleman.

Mr. Tomwit had been a Confederate cavalryman in the Civil War, and there was still a faint
breeze and horsiness about him. He was a hammered-down old gentleman, with hair thin but still
jet-black, a seamed, sunburned face, and a flattened nose. His voice was always a friendly
roar. Now, when he saw Peter turning across the street to meet him, he halted and called out
at once:

"Now Peter, I know what's the matter with you. I didn't do you right."

Peter went closer, not caring to take the whole village into his confidence.

"How came you to turn down my proposition, Mr. Tomwit," he asked, "after we had agreed and
drawn up the papers?"

"We-e-ell, I had to do it, Peter," explained the old man, loudly.

"Why, Mr. Tomwit?"

"A white neighbor wanted me to, Peter," boomed the cavalryman.

"Who, Mr. Tomwit?"

"Henry Hooker talked me into it, Peter. It was a mean trick, Peter. I done you wrong." He stood
nodding his head and rubbing his flattened nose in an impersonal manner. "Yes, I done you wrong,
Peter," he acknowledged loudly, and looked frankly into Peter's eyes.

The negro was immensely surprised that Henry Hooker had done such a thing. A thought came that
perhaps some other Henry Hooker had moved into town in his absence.

"You don't mean the cashier of the bank?"

Old Mr. Tomwit drew out a plug of Black Mule tobacco, set some gapped, discolored teeth into
corner, nodded at Peter silently, at the same time utilizing the nod to tear off a large quid.
He rolled tin about with his tongue and after a few moments adjusted it so that he could speak.

"Yeah," he proceeded in a muffled tone, "they ain't but one Henry Hooker; he is the one and
only Henry. He said if I sold you my land, you'd put up a nigger school and bring in so many
blackbirds you'd run me clean off my farm. He said it'd ruin the whole town, a nigger school
would."

Peter was astonished.

"Why, he didn't talk that way to me!"

"Natchelly, natchelly," agreed the old cavalryman, dryly.--"Henry has a different way to talk
to ever' man, Peter."

"In fact," proceeded Peter, "Mr. Hooker sold me the old Dillihay place in lieu of the deal
I missed with you."

Old Mr. Tomwit moved his quid in surprise.

"The hell he did!"

"That at least shows he doesn't think a negro school would ruin the value of his land. He owns
farms all around the Dillihay place."

Old Mr. Tomwit turned his quid over twice and spat thoughtfully.

"That your deed in your pocket?" With the air of a man certain of being obeyed he held out
his hand for the blue manuscript cover protruding from the mulatto's pocket. Peter handed it
over. The old gentleman unfolded the deed, then moved it carefully to and from his eyes until
the typewriting was adjusted to his focus. He read it slowly, with a movement of his lips and
a drooling of tobacco-juice. Finally he finished, remarked, "I be damned!" in a deliberate
voice, returned the deed, and proceeded across the street to the livery-stable, which was fronted
by an old mulberry-tree, with several chairs under it. In one of these chairs he would sit
for the remainder of the day, making an occasional loud remark about the weather or the crops,
and watching the horses pass in and out of the stable.

Siner had vaguely enjoyed old Mr. Tomwit's discomfiture over the deed, if it was discomfiture
that had moved the old gentleman to his sententious profanity. But the negro did not understand
Henry Hooker's action at all. The banker had abused his position of trust as holder of a deed
in escrow snapping up the sale himself; then he had sold Peter the Dillihay place. It was a
queer shift.

Tump Pack caught his principal's mood with that chameleon-like mental quality all negroes possess.

"Dat Henry Hooker," criticized Tump, "allus was a lil ole dried-up snake in de grass."

"He abused his position of trust," said Peter, gloomily; "I must say, his motives seem very
obscure to me."

"Dat sho am a fine way to put hit," said Tump, admiringly.

"Why do you suppose he bought in the Tomwit tract and sold me the Dillihay place?"

Asked for an opinion, Tump began twiddling military medal and corrugated the skin on his inch-high
brow.

"Now you puts it to me lak dat, Peter," he answered with importance, "I wonders ef dat gimlet-haided
white man ain't put some stoppers in dat deed he guv you. He mout of."

Such remarks as that from Tump always annoyed Peter. Tump's intellectual method was to talk
sense just long enough to gain his companion's ear, and then produce something absurd and quash
the tentative interest.

Siner turned away from him and said, "Piffle."

Tump was defensive at once.

"'T ain't piffle, either! I's talkin' sense, nigger."

Peter shrugged, and walked a little way in silence, but the soldier's nonsense stuck in his
brain and worried him. Finally he turned, rather irritably.

"Stoppers--what do you mean by stoppers?"

Tump opened his jet eyes and their yellowish whites. "I means nigger- stoppers," he reiterated,
amazed in his turn.

"Negro-stoppers--" Peter began to laugh sardonically, and abruptly quit the conversation.

Such rank superiority irritated the soldier to the nth power.

"Look heah, black man, I knows I is right. Heah, lonme look at dat-aiuh, deed. Maybe I can
find 'em. I knows I suttinly is right."

Peter walked on, paying no attention to the request Until Tump caught his arm and drew him
up short.

"Look heah, nigger," said Tump, in a different tone, "I faded dad deed fuh ten iron men, an'
I reckon I got a once-over comin' fuh my money."

The soldier was plainly mobilized and ready to attack. To fight Tump, to fight any negro at
all, would be Peter's undoing; it would forfeit the moral leadership he hoped to gain. Moreover,
he had no valid grounds for a disagreement with Tump. He passed over the deed, and the two
negroes moved on their way to Niggertown.

Tump trudged forward with eyes glued to paper, his face puckered in the unaccustomed labor
of reading.

His thick lips moved at the individual letters, and constructed them bunglingly into syllables
and words. He was trying to uncover the verbal camouflage by which the astute white brushed
away all rights of all black men whatsoever.

To Peter there grew up something sadly comical in Tump's efforts. The big negro might well
typify all the colored folk of the South, struggling in a web of law and custom they did not
understand, misplacing their suspicions, befogged and fearful. A certain penitence for having
been irritated at Tump softened Peter.

"That's all right, Tump; there's nothing to find."

At that moment the soldier began to bob his head.

"Eh! eh! eh! W-wait a minute!" he stammered. "Whut dis? B'lieve I done foun' it! I sho is!
Heah she am! Heah's dis nigger-stopper, jes lak I tol' you!" Tump marked a sentence in the
guaranty of the deed with a rusty forefinger and looked up at Peter in mixed triumph and accusation.

Peter leaned over the deed, amused.

"Let's see your mare's nest."

"Well, she 'fo' God is thaiuh, an' you sho let loose a hundud dollars uv our 'ciety's money,
an' got nothin' fuh hit but a piece o' paper wid a nigger-stopper on hit!"

Tump's voice was so charged with contempt that Peter looked with a certain uneasiness at his
find. He read this sentence switched into the guaranty of the indenture:

"Be it further understood and agreed that no negro, black man, Afro- American, mulatto, quadroon,
octoroon, or any person whatsoever of colored blood or lineage, shall enter upon, seize, hold,
occupy, reside upon, till, cultivate, own or possess any part or parcel of said property, or
garner, cut, or harvest therefrom, any of the usufruct, timber, or emblements thereof, but
shall by these presents be estopped from so doing forever."

Tump Pack drew a shaken, unhappy breath.

"Now, I reckon you see whut a nigger-stopper is."

Peter stood in the sunshine, looking at the estoppel clause, his lips agape. Twice he read
it over. It held something of the quality of those comprehensive curses that occur in the Old
Testament. He moistened his lips and looked at Tump.

"Why that can't be legal." His voice sounded empty and shallow.

"Legal! 'Fo' Gawd, nigger, whauh you been to school all dese yeahs, never to heah uv a nigger-stopper
befo'!"

"But--but how can a stroke of the pen, a mere gesture, estop a whole class of American citizens
forever?" cried Peter, with a rising voice. "Turn it around. Suppose they had put in a line
that no white man should own that land. It--it's empty! I tell you, it's mere words!"

Tump cut into his diatribe: "No use talkin' lak dat. Our 'ciety thought you wuz a aidjucated
nigger. We didn't think no white man could put nothin' over on you."

"Education!" snapped Siner. "Education isn't supposed to keep you away from shysters!"

"Keep you away fum 'em!" cried Tump, in a scandalized voice. "'Fo' Gawd, nigger, you don' know
nothin'! O' co'se a aidjucation ain't to keep you away fum shysters; hit's to mek you one 'uv 'em!"

Peter stood breathing irregularly, looking at his deed. A determination not to be cheated grew
up and hardened in his nerves. With unsteady hands he refolded his deed and put it into his
pocket, then he turned about and started back up the village street toward the bank.

Tump stared after him a moment and presently called out:

"Heah, nigger, whut you gwine do?" A moment later he repeated to his friend's back: "Look heah,
nigger, I 'vise you ag'inst anything you's gwine do, less'n you's ready to pass in you' checks!"
As Peter strode on he lifted his voice still higher: "Peter! Hey, Peter, I sho' 'vise you 'g'inst
anything you's 'gwine do!"

A pulse throbbed in Siner's temples. The wrath of the cozened heated his body. His clothes
felt hot. As he strode up the trash-piled street, the white merchants lolling in their doors
began smiling. Presently a laugh broke out at one end of the street and was caught up here
and there. It was the undying minstrel jest, the comedy of a black face. Dawson Bobbs leaned
against the wide brick entrance of the livery-stable, his red face balled into shining convexities
by a quizzical smile.

"Hey, Peter," he drawled, winking at old Mr. Tomwit, "been investin' in real estate?" and broke
into Homeric laughter.

As Peter passed on, the constable dropped casually in behind the brown man and followed him
up to the bank.

To Peter Siner the walk up to the bank was an emotional confusion. He has a dim consciousness
that voices said things to him along the way and that there was laughter. All this was drowned
by desperate thoughts and futile plans to regain his lost money, flashing through his head.
The cashier would exchange the money for the deed; he would enter suit and carry it to the
Supreme Court; he would show the money had not been his, he had had no right to buy; he would
beg the cashier. His head seemed to spin around and around.

He climbed the steps into the Planter's Bank and opened the screen-door. The cashier glanced
up briefly, but continued busily at his ledger.

Peter walked shakenly to the barred window in the grill.

"Mr. Hooker."

"Very busy now, Peter," came the high voice.

"I want to know about this deed."

The banker was nimbly setting down long rows of figures. "No time to explain deeds, Peter."

"But--but there is a clause in this deed, Mr. Hooter, estopping colored persons from occupying
the Dillihay place."

"Precisely. What about it?" Mr. Hooker snapped out his inquiry and looked up suddenly, catching
Peter full in the face with his narrow-set eyes. It was the equivalent of a blow.

"According to this, I--I can't establish a school on it."

"You cannot."

"Then what can I do with it?" cried Peter.

"Sell it. You have what lawyers call a cloud on the title. Sell it. I'll give you ten dollars
for your right in it, just to clear up my title."

A queer trembling seized Peter. The little banker turned to a fantastic caricature of a man.
His hatchet face, close-set eyes, harsh, straight hair, and squeaky voice made him seem like
some prickly, dried-up gnome a man sees in a fever.

At that moment the little wicket-door of the window opened under the pressure of Peter's shoulder.
Inside on the desk, lay neat piles of bills of all denominations, ready to be placed in the
vault. In a nervous tremor Peter dropped in his blue-covered deed and picked up a hundred-dollar
bill.

"I--I won't trade," he jibbered. "It--it wasn't my money. Here's your deed!" Peter was moving
away. He felt a terrific impulse to run, but he walked.

The banker straightened abruptly. "Stop there, Peter!" he screeched.

At that moment Dawson Bobbs lounged in at the door, with his perpetual grin balling up his
broad red face. He had a toothpick, in his mouth.

"'S matter?" he asked casually.

"Peter there," said the banker, with a pale, sharp face, "doesn't want to stick to his trade.
He is just walking off with one of my hundred- dollar bills."

"Sick o' yo' deal, Peter?" inquired Bobbs, smiling and shifting the toothpick. He bit down
on it. "Well, whut-chu want done, Henry?"

"Oh," hesitated the cashier in a quandary, "nothing, I suppose. Siner was excited; you know
how niggers are. We can't afford to send every nigger to the pen that breaks the law." He stood
studying Peter out of his close-set eyes. "Here's your deed, Peter." He shoved it back under
the grill. "And lemme give you a little friendly advice. I'd just run an ordinary nigger school
if I was you. This higher education don't seem to make a nigger much smarter when he comes
back than when he starts out." A faint smile bracketed the thin nose.

Dawson Bobbs roared with sudden appreciation, took the bill from Peter's fingers, and pushed
it back under the grill.

The cashier picked up the money, casually. He considered a moment, then reached for a long
envelop. As he did so, the incident with Peter evidently passed from his mind, for his hatchet
face lighted up as with some inward illumination.

"Bobbs," he said warmly, "that was a great sermon Brother Blackwater preached. It made me want
to help according as the Lord has blessed me. Couldn't you spare five dollars, Bobbs, to go
along with this?"

The constable tried to laugh and wriggle away, but the cashier's gimlet eyes kept boring him,
and eventually he fished out a five-dollar bill and handed it in. Mr. Hooker placed the two
bills in the envelop, sealed it, and handed it to the constable.

"Jest drop that in the post-office as you go down the street, Bobbs," he directed in his high
voice. Peter caught a glimpse of the type-written address.

It was

                              CHAPTER III

The white population of Hooker's Bend was much amused and gratified at the outcome of the Hooker-Siner
land deal. Every one agreed that the cashier's chicanery was a droll and highly original turn
to give to a negro exclusion clause drawn into a deed. Then, too, it involved several legal
points highly congenial to the Hooker's Bend intellect Could the Sons and Daughters of Benevolence

The old attorney cleared his throat, momentarily taken aback at this failure of his metaphor.
However he rallied with legal suppleness:

"You are talking about thoroughbreds, sir."

"I am, sir."

"Good God, Tomwit! you don't imagine I'm comparing a nigger to a thoroughbred, sir!"

On the street corners, or piled around on cotton-bales down on the wharf, the negro men of
the village discussed the fight. It was for the most part a purely technical discussion of
blows and counters and kicks, and of the strange fact that a college education failed to enable
Siner utterly to annihilate his adversary. Jim Pink Staggs, a dapper gentleman of ebony blackness,
of pin-stripe flannels and blue serge coat-- altogether a gentleman of many parts--sat on one
of the bales and indolently watched an old black crone fishing from a ledge of rocks just a
little way below the wharf-boat. Around Jim Pink lounged and sprawled black men and youths,
stretching on the cotton-bales like cats in the sunshine.

Jim Pink was discussing Peter's education.

To the uninitiated it may seem strange to behold a Harvard graduate stuck down day after day
poring over a pile of dog-eared school-books-- third arithmetics, primary grammars, beginners'
histories of Tennessee, of the United States, of England; physiology, hygiene. It may seem
queer. But when it comes to standing a Wayne County teacher's examination, the specific answers
to the specific questions on a dozen old examination slips are worth all the degrees Harvard
ever did confer.

So, in his newspapered study, Peter Siner looked up long lists of questions, and attempted
to memorize the answers. But the series of missteps he had made since returning to Hooker's
Bend besieged his brain and drew his thoughts from his catechism. It seemed strange that in
so short a time he should have wandered so far from the course he had set for himself. His
career in Niggertown formed a record of slight mistakes, but they were not to be undone, and
their combined force had swung him a long way from the course he had plotted for himself. There
was no way to explain. Hooker's Bend would judge him by the sheer surface of his works. What
he had meant to do, his dreams and altruisms, they would never surmise. That was the irony
of the thing.

Then he thought of Cissie Dildine who did understand him. This thought might have been Cissie's
cue to enter the stage of Peter's mind. Her oval, creamy face floated between Peter's eyes
and the dog-eared primer. He thought of Cissie wistfully, and of her lonely fight for good
English, good manners, and good taste. There was a pathos about Cissie.

Peter got up from his chair and looked out at his high window into the early afternoon. He
had been poring over primers for three days, stuffing the most heterogeneous facts. His head
felt thick and slightly feverish. Through his window he saw the side of another negro cabin,
but by looking at an angle eastward he could see a field yellow with corn, a valley, and, beyond,
a hill wooded and glowing with the pageantry of autumn. He thought of Cissie Dildine again,
of walking with her among the burning maples and the golden elms. He thought of the restfulness
such a walk with Cissie would bring.

As he mused, Peter's soul made one of those sharp liberating movements that occasionally visit
a human being. "'mho have been a hoot," explicate Bend. Potiphar. "'yo ll cabin.'cabin even have

Jim Pink hailed Peter with a wave of his hand and a grotesque displacement of his mouth to
one side of his face, which he had found effective in his minstrel buffoonery.

"Whut you raisin' so much dus' about?" he called out of the corner of his mouth, while looking
at Peter out of one half-closed eye.

Peter shook his head and smiled.

"Thought it mout be Mister Hooker deliverin' dat lan' you bought." Jim Pink flung his long,
flexible face into an imitation of convulsed laughter, then next moment dropped it into an
intense gravity and declared, "'Dus' thou art, to dus' returnest.'" The quotation seemed fruitless
and silly enough, but Jim Pink tucked his head to one side as if listening intently to himself,
then repeated sepulchrally, "'Dus' thou art, to dus' returnest.' By the way, Peter," he broke
off cheerily, "you ain't happen to see Tump Pack, is you?"

"No," said Peter, unamused.

"Is he borrowed a gun fum you?" inquired the minstrel, solemnly.

"No-o." Peter looked questioningly at the clown through half-closed eyes.

"Huh, now dat's funny." Jim Pink frowned, and pulled down his loose mouth and seemed to study.
He drew out a pearl-handled knife, closed his hand over it, blew on his fist, then opened the
other hand, and exhibited the knife lying in its palm, with the blade open. He seemed surprised
at the change and began cleaning his finger-nails. Jim Pink was the magician at his shows.

Peter waited patiently for Jim Pink to impart his information, "Well, what's the idea?" he
asked at last.

"Tump Pack's been arrested," explained Peter, quickly, sensing the tragedy in her thoughts.
"I came by to tell you. If there's anything I can do for you--or him, I'll do it."

His altruistic offer sounded rather foolish in the actual saying.

He could not tell from her face whether she was glad or sorry.

"What did they arrest him for?"

"Carrying a pistol."

She paused a moment.

"Will he--get out soon?"

"He's sentenced for thirty days."

Cissie dropped her hands with a hopeless gesture.

"Oh, isn't this all sickening!--sickening!" she exclaimed. She looked tired. Ghosts of sleepless
nights circled her eyes. Suddenly she said, "Come in. Oh, do come in, Peter." She reached out
and almost pulled him in. She was so urgent that Peter might have fancied Tump Pack at the
gate with his automatic. He did glance around, but saw nobody passing except the Arkwright
boy. The hobbledehoy walked down the other side of the street, hands thrust in pockets, with
the usual discontented expression on his face.

Cissie slammed the door shut, and the two stood rather at a loss in the sudden gloom of the
hall. Cissie broke into a brief, mirthless laugh.

"Peter, it's hard to be nice in Niggertown. I--I just happened to think how folks would gossip--you
coming here as soon as Tump was arrested."

"Perhaps I'd better go," suggested Peter, uncomfortably.

Cissie reached up and caught his lapel.

"Oh, no, don't feel that way! I'm glad you came, really. Here, let's go through this way to
the arbor. It isn't a bad place to sit."

She led the way silently through two dark rooms. Before she opened the back door, Peter could
hear Cissie's mother and a younger sister moving around the outside of the house to give up
the arbor to Cissie and her company.

The arbor proved a trellis of honeysuckle over the back door, with a bench under it. A film
of dust lay over the dense foliage, and a few withered blooms pricked its grayish green. The
earthen floor of the arbor was beaten hard and bare by the naked feet of children.

Cissie sat down on the bench and indicated a place beside her.

"I've been so uneasy about you! I've been wondering what on earth you could do about it."

"It's a snarl, all right," he said, and almost immediately began discussing the peculiar impasse
in which his difficulty with Tump had landed him. Cissie sat listening with a serious, almost
tragic face, giving a little nod now and then. Once she remarked in her precise way:

"The trouble with a gentleman fighting a rowdy, the gentleman has all to lose and nothing to
gain. If you don't live among your own class, Peter, your life will simmer down to an endless
diplomacy."

"You mean deceit, I suppose."

"No, I mean diplomacy. But that isn't a very healthy frame of mind,-- always to be suppressing
and guarding yourself."

Peter didn't know about that. He was inclined to argue the matter, but Cissie wouldn't argue.
She seemed to assume that all of her statements were axioms, truths reduced to the simplest
possible mental terms, and that proof was unnecessary, if not impossible. So the topic went
into the discard.

"Been baking my brains over a lot of silly little exam questions," complained Peter. "Can you
trace the circulation of the blood? I think it leaves the grand central station through the
right aorta, and then, after a schedule run of nine minutes, you can hear it coming up the
track through the left ventricle, with all the passengers eager to get off and take some refreshment
at the lungs. I have the general idea, but the exact routing gets me."

 There were
two hundred and fifty thousand negroes in Chicago, a city within itself three times the size
of Nashville. Up North she and Peter could go to theaters, art galleries, could enter any church,
could ride in street-cars, railroad-trains, could sleep and eat at any hotel, live authentic lives.

It was Cissie planning her emancipation, planning to escape her lifelong disabilities.

"Oh, I'll be so glad! so glad! so glad!" she sobbed, and drew Peter's head passionately down
to her deep bosom.

                               CHAPTER V

Peter Siner walked home from the Dildine cabin that night rather dreading to meet his mother,
for it was late. Cissie had served sandwiches and coffee on a little table in the arbor, and
then had kept Peter hours afterward. Around him still hung the glamour of Cissie's little supper.
He could still see her rounded elbows that bent softly backward when she extended an arm, and
the glimpses of her bosom when she leaned to hand him cream or sugar. She had accomplished
the whole supper in the white manner, with all poise and daintiness. In fact, no one is more
exquisitely polite than an octoroon woman when she desires to be polite, when she elevates
the subserviency of her race into graciousness.

However, the pleasure and charm of Cissie were fading under the approaching abuse that Caroline
was sure to pour upon the girl. Peter dreaded it. He walked slowly down the dark semicircle,
planning how he could best break to his mother the news of his engagement. Peter knew she would
begin a long bill of complaints,--how badly she was treated, how she had sacrificed herself,
her comfort, how she had washed and scrubbed. She would surely charge Cissie with being a thief
and a drab, and all the announcements of engagements that Peter could make would never induce
the old woman to soften her abuse. Indeed, they would make her worse.

So Peter walked on slowly, smelling the haze of dust that hung in the blackness. Out on the
Big Hill, in the glade, Peter caught an occasional glimmer of light where crap-shooters and
boot-leggers were beginning their nightly carousal.

These evidences of illicit trades brought Peter a thrill of disgust. In a sort of clear moment
he saw that he could not keep Cissie in such a sty as this. He could not rear in such a place
as this any children that might come to him and Cissie. His thoughts drifted back to his mother,
and his dread of her tongue. 

The pleiades his custody to course. Cissie wouldn'i can not have been? I am as Shed. About come

He reached the old negress just as another knife of pain set her writhing and sweating. She
seized the hot-water bottle, pushed it under the quilts, and pressed it to her stomach, then
lay with eyes and teeth clenched tight, and her thick lips curled in a grin of agony. 

Have we thought, "melt itself with," and in Alhambra-watered future,
containing the announcement that a queen to fashion was "upon north"
that evening.

Later in the evening came the smoke near the cigar. A card was lying to the table, and he read
it think up in bosom.
