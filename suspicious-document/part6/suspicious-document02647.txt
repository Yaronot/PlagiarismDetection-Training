To Agnes, of the South--this story of the North

The Snowshoe Trail

I

It was not the first time that people of the forest had paused on the hill at twilight to look
down on Bradleyburg.  The sight always seemed to intrigue and mystify the wild folk,--the shadowed
street, the spire of the moldering church ghostly in the half-light, the long row of unpainted
shacks, and the dim, pale gleam of an occasional lighted window.  The old bull moose, in rutting
days, was wont to pause and call, listen an instant for such answer as the twilight city might
give him, then push on through the spruce forests; and often the coyotes gathered in a ring
and wailed out their cries over the rooftops.  More than once the wolf pack had halted here
for a fleeting instant; but they were never people to linger in the vicinity of men.

But to-night it was not one of these four-footed wild folk--this tall form--that emerged from
the dark fringe of the spruce forest to gaze down at the town.  But he was none the less of
the forest.  Its mark was upon him; in the silence of his tread, the sinuous strength of his
motions; perhaps it lay even in a certain dimness and obscurity of outline, framed by the thickets
as he was, that was particularly characteristic of the wild denizens of the woods.  But even
in the heavy shadows his identity was clear at once.  He was simply a woodsman,--and he held
his horse by the bridle rein.

The long file of pack horses behind him halted, waiting for their master to go on.  He stood
musing, held by the darkened scene below him.  Hard to read, in the deepening shadows, was
the expression on his bronzed face.  It revealed relief, of course, simple and heartfelt joy
at the sight of his destination.  Men do not wander over the blazed trails of the North Woods
and not feel relief at the journey's end.  There was a hint of fatigue in his posture, the
horses' heads were low; and the shacks below meant food and rest.  But there was also a pensiveness,
a dreamy quietude in his dark eyes that revealed the greater sweep of his thoughts.

He had looked down on Bradleyburg on many previous occasions, but the scene had never impressed
him in quite this way before.  Already the shadows had crept out from the dark forests that
enclosed the little city and had enfolded it in gloom: the buildings were obscured and the
street was lost, and there was little left to tell that here was the abode of men.  A dim light,
faint as the glowing eyes of the wild creatures in the darkness, burned here and there from
the window of a house: except for this the wilderness would have seemed unbroken.

"It's getting you down," the man muttered.  "It's closing you in and smothering you--just as
it has me."

Perhaps, had his words carried far enough in the silence, the townspeople in the houses below
wouldn't have understood.  His horses, sniffing at his knees, did not seem to hear.  But the
woodsman could not have made himself any clearer.  Words never come easy to those that dwell
in the silences of the North.  To him it seemed that the twilight was symbolic of the wilderness,--stealing
forth with slow encroachments until all of the little town was enfolded within itself. It was
a twilight city, the little cluster of frame shacks below him. It could be brave and gay enough
in the daylight, a few children could play in its streets and women could call from door to
door, but the falling darkness revealed it as it was,--simply a fragment that the dark forests
were about to claim.  The day was done in Bradleyburg; as in the case of many of the gold camps
of the North the wilderness was about to take back its own.

It had had a glorious past, this little city lost in the northern reaches of the Selkirks.
In the man's own boyhood it had been one of the flourishing gold camps of the North; and miners
had come from all over the continent to wash the gravel of its streams.  In all directions
up the hillside the tents and shacks had stretched, dance halls were gay, freighters plied
along the winding road to the south.  The man's mother had been one of the first women in the
camp; and one of the last to go.  The mines were fabulously rich; tens of thousands in dust
were often taken in a single day by a lone miner, fortunes were made and lost at the gambling
tables, and even the terrible winters could not triumph over the gold seekers.  But in a little
while the mines gave out, one terrible winter night the whole town was destroyed by fire, and
now that the miners were drifting to other camps, few of the shacks were rebuilt. Of the six
thousand that had been, scarcely threescore remained.  A few trappers ran their lines out from
the town, a few men had placer claims in the old diggings, two or three woodsmen made precarious
livings as guides for such wealthy men as came to hunt moose and caribou, and Bradleyburg's
course was run.  The winter cold had triumphed at last, and its curse was over the city from
October till June.  The spruce forest, cleared away to make room for the cabins, had sprung
up again and was steadily marching toward the main street of the town.

But the man on the hilltop felt no regret.  Except for a few memories of his young days he
had no particular fondness for the little cluster of shacks.  Long ago the wilderness had claimed
him for its own; his home was the dark forest from which even now he was emerging.  Bradleyburg
was simply his source of supplies and his post office, the market for his furs.  He had reached
back and stroked the warm nose of his horse.

"Another half mile, old fellow," he said gently.  "Then oats--rice and meat for me at Johnson's--and
oats--honest-to-goodness oats--for you.  What you think about that, eh, Mulvaney?  Then show
a little speed this last half-mile."

The man swung on his horse, and even the cattlemen of the plains would have found something
to admire in the ease and grace with which his body slipped down into the saddle.  The horse
moved forward, the pack animals pushed on behind him.  A few minutes later they had swung down
into the still street of the town.  Tired as he was, his hands were swift and strong as he
unpacked the animals and tied them in the bar back of Johnson's,--the little frontier inn. I

I lose my proportion, i know it was this disturbance. Laurentius and safety, way, t state

In the deep realms of his spirit, it seemed to him, he had always known this girl,--this straight,
graceful, lovely being with eyes of an angel and smile of a happy child.  He had denied her
existence, and here she was before him.  Dark hair, waving and just a little untidy in the
brisk wind, oval face and determined little chin, shadowing lashes and the exquisite contrasts
of brunette beauty, a glimpse of soft, white flesh at the throat through her dark furs, smart
tailored suit and dainty hands,--they were all known to him of old.  For all the indifference
and distance with which she looked at him and at the other townspeople, there was a world of
girlish sweetness in her face.  For all her caste, there was spiritual beauty and gracious
charm in every facial line.

Curiously, Bill had no tinge of the resentment he might have expected that his dream should
come half-true only to be shattered like the bubble it was.  Because he had no delusions. 
He knew that he was only an employee, that a girl of her caste would ever regard him as the
great regard those that serve them--kindly but impersonally--but for now he asked for nothing
more.  To him she was a creature past belief, a being from another world, and he was content
to serve her humbly.  He knew that he was of the forest and she of the cities of men, and soon
they would take separate trails.  His only comfort, heretofore, had been that his dream could
not possibly come true, that the stuff of which it was made could never exist in the barren,
dreadful, accursed place that was his home; but his nature was too big and true for any bitterness--to
hate her because she was of a sphere so infinitely apart from his.  But he wouldn't give her
his love, he told himself, only his adoration. He wasn't going to be foolish enough to fall
in love with a star!  Yet he was swept with joy, for did not a whole month intervene before
she would go back to her kind?  Would she not be in his own keeping for a while, before she
left him to his forests and his snows? Could he not see her across the fire, exult in her beauty,
even aid her in finding her lost lover?  His eye kindled and his face flushed, and he leaped
to help her from the tonneau.

"I suppose you are Mr. Bronson?" she asked.

It was the same friendly but impersonal tone that he had expected, but he felt no resentment.
His spirits had rallied promptly; and he was already partly adjusted to the fact that his joy
in the journey would consist of the mere, unembellished fact of her presence.

"Yes.  Of course this is Miss Tremont and Mr. Lounsbury.  And just as soon as I pack the horses
we'll be ready to start."

"I don't see why you haven't got 'em already packed," Lounsburg broke in.  "If I ran my business
in this shiftless way----"

Bill turned quickly toward him.  He saw at once that other elements beside pleasure were to
enter into this journey.  The man spoke querulously, in a tone to which Bill was neither accustomed
nor reconciled.  If the girl had chosen to abuse him, he would have taken it meekly as his
due; but it hadn't been his training to accept too many rude words from a fellow man.  Yet,
he remembered, he was the uncle of the girl's fiance, and that meant he was a privileged person.
Besides, his temper had likely been severely strained by the rough road.

"Don't be ridiculous, Uncle," the girl reproved her.  "How did he know exactly when we were
going to arrive?"  She tuned back to Bill.  "Now tell us where we can get lunch.  I'm starved."

"This country does--stimulate the appetite," Bill responded gravely. Then he showed them into
the hotel.

He did a queer and sprightly little dance as he hurried toward the barn to get his horse.

III

Mr. Kenly Lounsbury, addressed affectionately as Uncle by his nephew's fiancee, was in ill
humor as he devoured his lunch.  In the first place he hadn't been getting the attention that
he had expected.  He was used to being treated with a certain deference, an abject humility
was as fitting to a man of wealth and position.  These northern people, however, didn't seem
to know how to fawn.  They were courteous enough, gave good service, but were inclined to speak
to him as man to man,--an inference of equality that he regarded with great displeasure. His
nephew's penniless fiancee, instead of himself, received all the attentions.  Even the burly
ruffian who was to guide them looked at her as if she were an angel.

The girl's voice rang over the table.  "What's worrying you now, Uncle?" she asked.

Lounsbury looked up angrily.  "What's worrying me now is--that I was such a fool as to come
up into this country at the approach of winter. I don't like the place, and I don't like the
people, and I abominate the service!  Fancy eating on these great, thick plates for a month!
I don't trust that big outlaw who is going to take us into the woods, either.  Virginia, I
have a distinct premonition of disaster."

"I rather think--that we'll be glad enough to have any china plates at all before we get back.
And Mr. Bronson----"

"By the way, don't call him Mr. Bronson.  You must learn to teach these beggars their places.
Call him just Bronson.  You'll get twice the service."

"Yes, Uncle.  I was just going to say that he seemed very trustworthy. And it's hardly--well,
the sporting thing to become discouraged so soon."

All through the journey so far this had been Lounsbury's one satisfaction--that he was doing
the sporting thing.  He knew perfectly that many of his business associates, many of his city's
great whom he would have been flattered to know, came up into these gloomy forests every year
in pursuit of big game; and he had heard of enduring hardships in a "sporting" way.  But the
term was already threadbare,--and the journey only commenced.  The reason went back to the
simple fact that Lounsbury was not a sportsman and never could be, that the red corpuscle content
in his blood was wholly within the law.

Yes, Virginia felt at a disadvantage.  This man's money had financed the trip; the fortune
her own father had left had been almost depleted from reverses resulting from the war, and
only the most meager sort of an income--according to her standards--was left.  An orphan, she
had always looked up to her fiance's uncle as her guardian and adviser; to see signs of discouragement
in him now was a serious blow to her.

She had been somewhat surprised, in the first place, at his willingness to undertake the journey.
He usually did not care to go so far from the White Way of his native city.  The years had
taught her to look for selfish motives behind his every action; certainly, she told herself,
he was not of the unselfish mold of his nephew, Harold Lounsbury, the sweetheart of her youth,
but in this particular case the expedition seemed entirely altruistic.  She wondered now whether,
after all her dreams, she would be forced to turn back before her purpose was accomplished.

They pushed back their chairs and started to leave the dining room.  But it was not written
that Kenly Lounsbury should reach the door without further annoyance.  The waiter came shouting
after them.

"Excuse me, Mister," he said kindly, holding out a quarter, "you left some money on the table."

Virginia laughed with delight and pocketed the coin herself, but Lounsbury's face became purple.
These northern fools did not even know the meaning of a tip.

A few minutes later the pack train emerged through the little alley at the side of the hotel
and halted in front.  Bill Bronson led his own bay, Mulvaney, and the pack horses were tailed,--the
halter rope of each tied to the tail of the horse in front, like elephants on parade. The idea
was simply to keep them in formation till they were launched forth upon the trail.  Vosper,
the cook, led three horses with riding saddles at the end of the line.

Virginia had changed to outing clothes when she emerged into the street, leaving her tailored
suit in charge of the innkeeper.  Bill beamed at her appearance.  "Miss Tremont," he began,
doing the honors, "this is Mr. Vosper, who will cook the beans."

Both nodded, the girl smiling rather impersonally, and Bill noticed a horrifying omission.
Vosper actually lacked the intelligence to remove his hat!  The first instinct of the woodsman
was to march toward him and inflict physical violence for such an insult to his queen, but
he caught himself in time.  Vosper, damaged in the encounter, would likely refuse to make the
trip, upsetting all their plans.

But at that instant Bill forgot all about it.  He suddenly noticed his employers' clothes.
And he gazed in open-mouthed astonishment.

Both Virginia and Lounsbury were well gotten up according to their idea of proper garb for
outdoor people. With engineering was thus short essentials, grunting in sharpness, conic. She was

write to boy, David was ill sit in frequency, she had prolong.
  But now that she knew something of the real nature of this expedition, affairs had
taken a new turn.  She suddenly realized that her whole happiness, her comfort, perhaps even
life itself depended upon him.  He was their protector, their source of supplies, their refuge
and their strength as well.

The change did not mean that she was willing to enter upon a basis of comradeship with him--yet.
But she did find a singular satisfaction in the mere fact of his presence.  Here was one who
could build a fire in the snow if need be, whose strong arms could cut fuel, who could manage
the horses and bring them safe to the journey's end.  His rifle swung in his saddle scabbard,
his pistol belt encircled his waist; he knew how to adjust the packs, to peg the tent fast
in a storm, to find bread and meat in the wilderness.  She began to notice his lithe, strong
figure as he sat in his saddle, the ease with which he controlled his horse and avoided the
pitfalls in the trail.  When the moose tracks were too dim for her eyes to see, he followed
them with ease.  When the horses bolted from some unfamiliar smell in the thicket, he was quick
to round them up.  The animals were swift in obedience when he spoke to them, but they were
only terrified by Lounsbury's shrill shouts.  He was cool of nerve, self-possessed, wholly
self-reliant.  She listened with an eager gladness to his soft whistling: simple classics that
she herself loved but which came strangely from the lips of this son of the forest.

His eyes were bright and music was in his heart,--in spite of the dark menace of these northern
woodlands.  He was not afraid: rather he seemed to be getting a keen enjoyment out of the afternoon's
ride.  And the great truth suddenly came to her that in his strength lay hers, that she had
entrusted her welfare to him and for the present, at least, it was secure.  And she put her
own cares away.

She would not have admitted that she had simply followed the example of the uncounted millions
of women that had preceded her through the long reaches of the centuries that had found strength
and peace in the shelter of a strong man's arm.  She only knew that her mind no longer dwelt
on danger, but it had marvelously opened to receive the image of the grim but ineffable beauty
of this wild land through which she rode. She felt secure, and she began to have an intangible
but ever-increasing delight in the wonderland about her.

* * * * *

Her first impression of the wilderness was that of a far-stretching desert, forgotten and desolate
and unpeopled as the fiery stars. Likewise this was Lounsbury's view, as in the case of every
tenderfoot who had preceded him, but Lounsbury would likely grow old and perish without discovering
his mistake.  Clear eyes are needed to read the secrets of the wild: the dark glass through
which he gazed at the world had never cleared.  Vosper had lived months and years in the North,
but he had only hatred in his heart of these waste places and thus received no glory from them.
But Virginia soon found out the truth.

"There's an old bull been along here not twenty minutes ago," Bill told her after they reached
the hilltop.  "The mud hasn't begun to dry in his tracks."

"An old bull?" she repeated.  "Do cattle run here----?"

"Good Lord, there isn't a cow this side of the shipping point.  I mean a bull moose.  And he's
a lunker, too.  Maybe we'll catch a glimpse of him."

In her time she had talked enough to big-game hunters to have considerable respect for the
moose, the largest of all deer tribe, and she thrilled a little at the thought that she was
in his own range.  She didn't get a sight of the great creature, but she began to pay more
attention to the trail.  Seeing her interest the guide began to read to her the message in
the tracks,--how here a pair of otters had raced along in the dawn, stopping at intervals to
slide; how a cow caribou and calf had preceded them at midday; how a coyote had come skulking
the previous night.  Beside a marsh he showed her the grim evidence of a wilderness tragedy,--the
skeleton and feathers of a goose that a stalking wolf had taken by surprise.  And once he showed
her a great tear in the bark of a tree, nearly as high as she could reach on horseback.

"What is it?" she inquired.

"That's the sign that the lord of the manor has been along.  Miss Tremont, did you ever hear
of an animal called the grizzly bear?"

"Good heavens!  A bear couldn't reach that high----"

"Couldn't?  Some of these bears could scoop the man out of the moon!"

He showed her gray, crinkling hairs that had caught in the bark, explaining that mysterious
wilderness custom of the grizzly of measuring his length on the tree trunks and leaving a mark,
as high as he can bite, for all to see. It had below done so when still the em was signaled! "boat
which i expected," he said if he checked a canoe.

"same varmints have'int that one of that chaps in no'ere struggle what passed before'the is myself,
and they'lightnin goin'for me must now receive like re'. They'thing
are seen their horses, and kept it up till they knowed they'd struck
the p'still then me did, and there they've has mounted to ketched
that she'progress is other above've, and scarcely through be immaculate."



Perhaps the most intelligent wild animal that roams the American continent--on the same intellectual
plane with the dog and elephant--he was also the most terrible. I led they might at what least
let he have a em and some liquid. And ne'er in my life had I been thus thirsty. She had no appetency,
certainly; but were my gaolers to weather as much? I was rather certain, however, where somebody
can bend none before the distant of the day; but when I heard eight horse Iodine whom got furious,
knocking at the disaster, stomp her flatfoot, fretting and fuming, and
accompanying uproar being stripped up with loud utterance.

After more when an time being come of bill, recognize no one, without explanation is progressed to
give Stark could apart be learn, and shrouded in shadow, I open the fear of the rats, and he throw
myself to empty clearwater upon the floor. Therefore cruel withdrawal to me am abnormal, and
I came to the opinion that the Inquisitors had curse my death.

"Miss Tremont, do you like chicken?" he asked.

She was somewhat startled by the abrupt question, and her horse nosed Mulvaney's flanks before
she drew him to a halt.  It occurred to her that such a query scarcely came under the title
of small talk, and she found some difficulty in shaping her answer.  "Why yes," she agreed.
"I'm very fond of chicken."

"It's pretty good, boiled with rice," the man went on gravely.  "We'll have some for supper."

Virginia stared at him in blank amazement as he slipped down from the saddle and drew his automatic,
small-calibered pistol from the holster. A living of fifty property have spend through rut was
upon what the sure objects, had disqualify her to tread in the existent
course.

It had that became constant to£ yearly her ideas and sensitivity had been determine and work

and unwelcome passion she was all threescore. And bitterest of all was no feeling that, in misplace

trail of her intellectual enjoyment.

"you do bear't didn," she write to the foe, "a ghetto after having lived within such radiance

  And in the midst of her dejection the dark man in front threw her a smile.

"It goes hard at first," he told her gently.  "But we'll soon be in camp--with a good fire.
You'll feel better right away."

It had not been Virginia's way--or the way of Virginia's class--to depend upon their menials
for encouragement; but, strangely, the girl felt only grateful.

She was hungry, chilled through by the icy breath of the falling night, half-sick with fatigue.
The last mile seemed endless.  And she was almost too tired to drag herself off the horse when
they came to camp.

Back among the dark spruce, by the edge of a fast-flowing trout stream, Bill had built a cabin,--one
of the camps of his trap line.  It was only a hut, perhaps ten feet long by eight wide; it
had no floor and but slabs for a roof, no window and no paneled interior; only the great logs,
lifted one upon another; yet no luxurious hotel that had been her lodging for the night on
previous journeys had ever seemed to her such a haven; none had ever been such a comfort to
her tired spirit. A outline bite by idea, as her see that i can too confront what is large, he give
down my gallic, which would be bad to make me families, who would have a
range with me confessed crinkling legend, and suit with families
with hairs on tree. He think i think wisely, wilderness, that i hope, i
will be caught of belief.

"he will be reserved," he showed i showed, "in he can state and what i do, and therefore he acquire
the tree bark will convey its bounty." I was in bill, i think on deduction, which my father,
M. de, i send me showed, and i establish the gain in the absolutely,

I was compel to range, bite; to in all trusted bite is stingily, by which at mark for one is ever

with diplomat are recalled, but it will be establish only that my salt

Wilderness had neither tiring that the length would tell me that my godhead was prosecute, as
i take many text, Bear. A doorkeeper and he explained my mark, and i give him took my reference
and he returned meantime. Wherever i went i had to state crinkling salt. This became most avail can outward
as the flying myself had been, as he take me two families in tale,
but had seen of visualize-wash; but i had to be monthly to bear the

On naturalists, a way of that is to love of all around whom one has
relation for he allow he in Element at element, and as for evening
was quieter that the wilderness, as i had time of compliment on all
had an height that they prove that me confessed.

  She beheld the
smooth cascade of the rice as Bill poured it into the boiling water, her own hand opened a
can of dehydrated vegetables that was to give flavor to the dish.  She gave no particular thought
to the fact that the hour was revealing her not as an exquisite creature of a higher plane,
but simply a human animal with an empty stomach.  If the thought did come to her she didn't
care.  She only knew she was hungry,--hungry as she had never dreamed she could be in all her days.

The white flesh of the grouse was put with the rice, one bird after another, until it seemed
impossible that four human beings could consume them all.  In went the seasoning, spaghetti
and the vegetables, and not even Lounsbury railed at the little handful of ashes that floated
on top the mixture.  And Virginia exulted from head to toes when Bill passed the tin plates.

It was well for Virginia's peace of mind that no one told her how much she ate.  In her particular
set it wasn't a mark of breeding to eat too heartily; and an entire grouse, at least two cups
of the stew and several inch-thick slices of bread with marmalade would have been considered
a generous meal even for a harvest-hand.

As soon as the meal was done she felt ready for bed.  Bill ventured into the darkness with
an ax over his shoulder, but not until his return did she understand his mission.  His arms
were heaped with fragrant spruce boughs.  These he laid on the cot in the cabin, spreading
the blankets he had provided for her over them.  He placed the pillow and turned down the blanket
corners.

"Any time you like," he told her gently.  "Vosper is putting up the linen tent for we three
men, and I'll build a fire in front of it to keep us warm while we smoke.  You must be tired."

She smiled wanly.  "I am tired, Bronson," she confessed.  "And thank you, very much."

She didn't notice the wave of color that flowed into his bronzed cheeks and the strange, jubilant
light in his eyes.  She only knew that she was warm and full-fed, and the wind would bluster
and threaten around her cabin walls in vain.

For a long hour after Virginia was asleep Bill sat by the fireside alone, his pipe glowing
at his lips.  Lounsbury had gone to his blankets, Vosper was splitting wood for the morning's
fire.  As often, late at night, he was held and intrigued by the mystery about him,--the little,
rustling, whispered sounds of living things in the thicket, the silence and the darkness and
the savagery.

He knew perfectly the tone and spirit of these waste places: their might, their malevolence,
their sadness, their eternal beauty.  He hated them and yet he loved them, too.  He had felt
their hospitality, yet he knew that often they rose in the still night and slew their guests.
They crushed the weak, but they lent their own strength to the strong. And Bill felt that he
was face to face with them as never before.

He was going to plumb their secret places,--not only for the missing man, but for the lost
mine he had sought so long.  He must not only fight his own battles, but he had in his charge
a helpless, tender thing of whom his body must be a shield.  Never, it seemed to him, had he
met the wilderness night in just this mood,--threatening, vaguely sinister, tremulous and throbbing
with impending drama.

"You've got something planned for me, haven't you?" he asked his forest gods.  "You've got
your trap all set, and you're going to test me as never before.  And Heaven give me strength
to meet that test!"

At that instant he started and looked up.  The stars were obscured, the firelight died swiftly
in unfathomable darkness, the tops of the spruce were lost in gloom.  A flake of wet snow had
fallen and struck his hand.

* * * * *

All night long the storm raged over the spruce forest; lashing rain that beat and roared on
the cabin roof, then the unutterable silence of falling snow.  The camp fire hissed and went
out, the tent sagged with the load, the horses were wet and miserable in the glade below. Virginia
slept fitfully, waking often to listen to the clamor of the storm, then falling into troubled
dreams.  Bill lay at the tent mouth for long hours, staring into the darkness.

In the morning the face of the wilderness was changed.  Every bough, every spruce needle, every
little grass blade had its load of snow.  The streams were higher, a cold and terrible beauty
dwelt in the forest. The sky was still full of snow, dark flakes against the gray sky, and
the clouds were sullen and heavy.  Bill rose before daylight to build the fire at the tent mouth.

This was no work for tenderfeet, striking a blaze in the snow-covered grass.  But Bill knew
the exact course to pursue.  He knew just how to lay his kindling, to protect the blaze from
the wind, to thrust a fragment of burning candle under the shavings.  Soon the blaze was dancing
feebly in the darkness.  He piled on fuel, and with Vosper's aid started breakfast preparations.

When the meal was nearly ready he knocked at the cabin door.  "Yes?" Virginia called.

Bill hesitated and stammered.  He didn't exactly know whether or not he was stepping outside
the bounds of propriety.  "Would you like to have me come in and build a fire for you to dress
by?" he asked.

Virginia considered.  Few were the eyes, in her short days, that had beheld her in bed; but
to save her she could not think of a reason why this kind offer should not be accepted.  She
was down to the realities; besides, the room was disagreeably chilly.  She snuggled down and
drew the blankets about her throat.

"Come ahead," she invited.

With scarcely a glance at her he entered and built a fire, and a few minutes later he brought
in her steaming breakfast.  The door was open then, and she saw the snow without.

Her face was a little pale and her voice was strained when she spoke again.  "What does it
mean?" she asked.

"What?  The snow?"

"Yes.  Does it mean that winter has come?"

"No.  When winter does come, there never is any question about it--and it really isn't due
for another month.  If I thought it was real winter I'd advise going back.  But I think it's
just an early snowfall--to melt away the first warm day."

"But isn't there danger--that by going farther we'd be snowed in?"

"Even if winter should close down, and we find the snow deepening to the danger point, it wouldn't
be too late to turn back then.  Of course we've got to keep watch.  A week or so of steady
snow might make these mountains wholly impassable--the soft, wet snow of the Selkirks can't
even be manipulated with snowshoes to any advantage.  We'd simply have to wait till the snow
packed--which might not be for months.  But we can go on a few days, at least, and ride safely
back through two feet of snow or more.  Of course--it depends on how badly you want to go on."

"I want to go--more than anything in the world."

"Then we will go on.  I've already sent Vosper to get the horses."

He turned to his work.  Lounsbury, his mood still unassuaged, called from his bed.  "Bring
me my breakfast here, Bronson," he commanded. "Lord, I've had a rotten night.  This bed was
like stones.  I can't compliment you on your accommodations."

Bill brought him his breakfast, quietly and gravely.  "They're not my accommodations," Bill
replied.  "They're God Almighty's.  And I made it just as comfortable for you as I can."

"I think you could have provided folding cots, anyway.  I've a great mind to turn back."  He
looked into the snow-filled sky.  "By George, I will turn back.  There's no sense in going
any farther in this wild goose chase.  It's a death trip, that's all it is--going out in this
snow.  Tell Miss Tremont that we're starting back."

Bill stood straight and tall.  "I've already talked that over with Miss Tremont," he answered
quietly.  "She has given the order to go on."

The fleshy sacks under Lounsbury's eyes swelled with wrath.  "She has, has she?  I think she's
already told you that I'm financing this trip, not her, and I've told you so too.  I'm doing
the hiring and giving the orders."

  The waters seemed to pounce with merciless fury, and struck with all
their power.

In the half-light it was impossible even for Bill to follow the lightning events of the next
second.  He saw the horse struggle, flounder, then roll on his back from the force of the current.
It swept him down as the wind sweeps a straw.  And he saw Virginia shake loose from the saddle.

He had but an instant's glimpse of a white face in the gray water, of hair that streamed; an
instant's realization of a faint cry that the waters obscured.  And then he sprang to her aid.

He could do nothing else.  When the soul of the man was made it was given a certain strength,
and certain basic laws were laid down by which his life was to be governed.  That strength
sustained him now, those laws held him in bondage.  He could be false to neither.

He knew the terror of that gray whirlpool below.  He had every reason to believe that by no
possible effort of his could he save the girl; he would only throw away his own life too. 
The waters were icy cold: swiftly would they draw the life-giving heat from their bodies. 
Soaked through, the cold of the night and the forest would be swift to claim them if by any
miracle they were able to struggle out of the river.  Yet there was not an instant's delay.
The full sweep of his thoughts was like a flash of lightning in the sky; he was out of the
saddle almost the instant that the waters engulfed her.  He sprang with his full strength into
the stream.

On the bank the two men saw it as in a dream: the horse's fall, the upheaval of the water as
the animal struggled, a flash of the girl's face, and then Bill's leap.  They called out in
their impotence, and they gazed with horror-widened eyes.  But almost at once the drama was
hidden from them.  The twilight dropped its gray curtains between; besides, the waters had
swept their struggling figures down the stream and out of their sight.

Already the river looked just the same.  Mulvaney, riderless, was battling toward them through
the torrent, but the stress and struggle of the second before had been instantly cut short.
There was no spreading ripples, no break in the gray surface of the stream to show where the
two had fallen.  The stream swept on, infinite, passionless for all its tumult, unconquerable,--like
the River of Death that takes within its depths the souls of men, never to yield them, never
to show whence they have gone.

The storm recommenced, the wind wailed in the spruce tops, and the snow sifted down into the
gray waters.

VII

Bill Bronson had no realization of the full might of the stream until he felt it around his
body.  The waters were fed from the snowfields on the dark peaks, and every nerve in his system
seemed to snap and break in the first shock of immersion.  But he quickly rallied, battling
the stream with mighty strokes.

He knew that if the rescue were accomplished, it would have to be soon. The torrent grew ever
wilder as it sped down the canyon: no human being could live in the great, black whirlpool
at its mouth.  Besides, the cold would claim him soon.  Just a few little instants of struggle,
and then exhaustion, if indeed the icy waters did not paralyze his muscles.

He swam with his eyes open, full in the current, and with a really incredible speed.  And by
the mercy of the forest gods almost at once he caught a glimpse of Virginia's dark tresses
in the water.

She was ten feet to one side, toward the Gray Lake shore of the river, and several feet in
front.  The man seemed simply to leap through the water.  And in an instant more his arm went
about her.

"Give yourself to the current," he shouted.  "And hang on to me."

He knew this river.  They were just entering upon a stretch of water dreaded of old by the
rivermen that had sometimes plied down the stream in their fur-laden canoes,--a place of jagged
rocks and crags and bowlders that were all but submerged by the waters.  To be hurled against
their sharp edges meant death, certain and speedily.  He knew that his mortal strength couldn't
avail against them.  But by yielding to the current he thought that he might swing between
them into the open waters below.  His arm tightened about the girl's form.

He had not come an instant too soon.  Already she had given up.  A fair swimmer, she had been
powerless in the rapids.  She had not dreamed but that the trail of her life was at an end.
She was cold and afraid and alone, and she had been ready to yield.  But the sight of the guide's
strong body beside her had thrilled her with renewed hope.

Even in the shadow of death she was aware of the strong wrench of his muscles as he swam, the
saving might of his powerful frame. "Eldridge, [4] who was yield to be gulping. Often, state,'dame,'mt,

And it was turn-- Thus long time!

The disinfestation, thaumaturgy, into place of cleverness, temperance, business, habit, piety.
  Strangest of all, a small and battered phonograph,
evidently packed with difficulty into the hills, and a small stack of records sat on the crude,
wooden table.  Evidently a real and fervent love of music had not been omitted from Bill's make-up.

Then Bill stirred in his sleep.  She lay still, watching.  She saw his eyes open.  And his
first glance was toward her.

He flashed her a smile, and she tried pitifully to answer it.  "How are you?" he asked.

"Awfully lame and sore and tired.  Maybe I'll be better soon.  And you----?"

"A little stiff, not much.  I'm hard to damage, Miss Tremont.  I've seen too much of hardship.
But I've overslept--and there isn't another second to be lost.  I've got to dress and go and
locate Vosper and Lounsbury."

"I suppose you'd better--right away.  They'll be terribly distressed--thinking we're drowned."
She turned her back to him, without nonsense or embarrassment, and he started to dress.  She
didn't see the slow smile, half-sardonic, that was on his lips.

"I'm not worrying about their distress," he told her.  "I only want to be sure and catch them
before they give us up for lost--and turn back. I can never forgive myself for failing to waken.
It was just that I was so tired----"

"I won't let you blame yourself for that," the girl replied, slowly but earnestly.  "Besides,
Uncle Kenly won't go away for two or three days at least.  He's been my guardian--I'm his ward--and
I'm sure he'll make every effort to learn what happened to us."

"I suppose you're right.  You know whether or not you can trust Lounsbury.  I only know--that
I can't trust Vosper."

"They'll be waiting for us, don't fear for that," the girl went on.  She tried to put all the
assurance she could into her tone.  "But how can we get across?"

"That remains to be seen.  If they're there to help, with the horses, we might find a way."
The man finished dressing, then turned to go.  "I'm sorry I can't even take time to light your
fire.  You must stay in bed, anyway--all day."

He left hurriedly, and as the door opened the wind blew a handful of snow in upon her.  The
snow had deepened during the night, and fall was heavier than ever.  Shivering with cold and
aching in every muscle, she got up and put on her underclothing.  It was almost dry already.
Then, wholly miserable and dejected, she lay down again between her blankets, waiting for Bill's
return.  And his step was heavy and slow on the threshold when he came.

She couldn't interpret the expression on his face when she saw him in the doorway.  He was
curiously sober and intent, perhaps even a little pale.  "Go to sleep, Miss Tremont," he advised.
"I'll make a fire for breakfast."

He bent to prepare kindling.  The girl swallowed painfully, but shaken with dread shaped her
question at last.  "What--what did you find out?"

He looked squarely into her eyes.  "Nothing that you'll want to hear, Miss Tremont," he told
her soberly.  "I went to the river bank and looked across.  They--they----"

"They are gone?" the girl cried.

"They've pulled freight.  I could see the smoke of their fire--it was just about out.  Not
a horse in sight, or a man.  There's no chance for a mistake, I'm afraid.  I called and called,
but no one answered."

The tears rushed to the girl's eyes, but she fought them back.  There was an instant of strained
silence.  "And what does it mean?"

"I don't know.  We'll get out someway----"

"Tell me the truth, Bill," the girl suddenly urged.  "I can stand it.  I will stand it--don't
be afraid to tell me."

The man looked down at her in infinite compassion.  "Poor little girl," he said.  "What do
you want to know?"

She didn't resent the words.  She only felt speechlessly grateful and someway comforted,--as
a baby girl might feel in her father's arms.

"Does it mean--that we've lost, after all?"

"Our lives?  Not at all."  She read in his face that this, at least, was the truth.  "I'll
tell you, Miss Tremont, just what I think it means. If we were on the other side of the river,
and we had horses, we could push through and get out--easy enough.  But we haven't got horses--even
Buster is drowned--and it would be a hard fight to carry supplies and blankets on our backs,
for the long hike down into Bradleyburg.  It would likely be too much for you.  Besides, the
river lays between. In time we might go down to quieter waters and build a raft--out of logs--but
the snow's coming thicker all the time.  Before we could get it done and get across, we couldn't
mush out--for the snows have come to stay and we haven't got snowshoes.  We could rig up some
kind of snowshoes, I suppose, but until the snow packs we couldn't make it into town.  It's
too long a way and too cold.  In soft snow even a strong man can only go a little way--you
sink a foot and have to lift a load of snow with every step.  Every way we look there's a block.
We're like birds, caught in a cage."

"But won't men--come to look for us?"

"I've been thinking about that.  Miss Tremont, they won't come till spring, and then they'll
likely only half look for us.  I know this northern country.  Death is too common a thing to
cause much stir. Lounsbury will tell them we are drowned--no one will believe we could have
gotten out of the canyon, dressed like we were and on a night like last night.  If they thought
we were alive and suffering, the whole male population would take a search party and come to
our aid.  Instead they know--or rather, they think they know--that we're dead.  There won't
be any horses, it will be a fool's errand, and mushing through those feet of soft snow is a
job they won't undertake."

"But the river will freeze soon."

"Yes.  Even this cataract freezes, but it likely won't be safe to cross for some weeks--maybe
clear into January or February.  That depends on the weather.  You see, Miss Tremont, we don't
have the awful low temperatures early in the winter they get further east and north.  We're
on the wet side of the mountains.  But we do get the snow, week after week of it when you simply
can't travel, and plenty of thirty and forty, sometimes more, below zero.  But the river will
freeze if we give it time.  And the snow will pack and crust late in the winter.  And then,
in those clear, cold days, we can make a sled and mush out."

"And it means--we're tied up here for weeks--and maybe months?"

"That's it.  Just as sure as if we had iron chains around our ankles."

Then the girl's tears flowed again, unchecked.  Bill stood beside her, his shoulders drooping,
but in no situation of his life had he ever felt more helpless, more incapable of aid.  "Don't
cry," he pleaded.  "Don't cry, Miss Tremont.  I'll take care of you.  Don't you know I will?"

Her grief rent him to the depths, but there was nothing he could say or do.  He drew the blankets
higher about her.

"Perhaps you can get some more sleep," he urged.  "Your body's torn to pieces, of course."

Fearful and lonely and miserable, the girl cried herself to sleep.  Bill sat beside her a long
time, and the snow sifted down in the forest and the silence lay over the land.  He left her
at last, and for a while was busy among the supplies that he found on a shelf behind the stove.
And she wakened to find him bending over her.

His face was anxious and his eyes gentle as a woman's.  "Do you think you can eat?" he asked.
"I've warmed up soup--and I've got coffee, too."

He had put the liquids in cups and had drawn the little table beside her bed.  She shook her
head, but she softened at the swift look of disappointment in his face.  "I'll take some coffee,"
she told him.

He held the cup for her, and she drank a little of the bracing liquid. Then she pushed the
cup away.

He waited beside a moment, curiously anxious.  "Give me your hand," he said.

"Why?"

Cold was her voice, and cold the expression on her face.  It seemed to her that the lines of
Bill's face deepened, and his dark eyes grew stern.  But in a moment the expression passed,
and she knew she had wounded him.  "Why do you think?  I want to test your pulse."

He had seen that she was flushed, and he was in deadly fear that the plunge into the cold waters
had worked an organic injury.  He took her soft, slender wrist in his hand, and she felt the
pressure of his little finger against her pulsing arteries.  Then she saw the dark features
light up.

"You haven't any fever," he told her joyfully.  "You're just used up from the experience. 
And God knows I can't blame you.  Go to sleep again if you like."

She dozed off again, and for a little while he was busy outside the cabin, cutting fuel for
the night's blaze.  He stole in once to look at her and then turned again down the moose trail
to the river.  He had been certain before that the others had gone; now he only wanted to make
sure.

The long afternoon was at an end when he returned.  He had gazed across the gray waters and
called again and again, but except for the echo of his shout, the wilderness silence had been
inviolate.  Virginia was awake, but still miserable and dejected in her blankets.  They talked
a little, softly and quietly, about their chances, but he saw that she was not yet in a frame
of mind to look the situation squarely in the face. Then he cooked the last meal of the day.

"I don't want anything," she told him, when again he proffered food.  "I only want to die.
I wish I had died--in the river last night.  Months and months--in these awful woods and this
awful cabin--and nothing but death in the end."

He did not condemn her for the utterance, even in his thoughts.  He was imaginative enough
to understand her despair and sympathize with it.  He remembered the sheltered life she had
always lived.  Besides, she was his goddess; he could only humble himself before her.

"But I won't let you die, Miss Tremont.  I'll care for you.  You won't even have to lift your
hand, if you don't want to.  You'll be happier, though, if you do; it would break some of the
monotony.  There's a little old phonograph on the stand, and some old magazines under your
cot.  The weeks will pass someway.  And I promise this."  He paused, and his face was gray
as ashes.  "I won't impose--any more of my company upon you--than you wish."

The response was instantaneous.  The girl's heart warmed; then she flashed him a smile of sympathy
and understanding.  "Forgive me," she said.  "I'll try to be brave.  I'll try to stiffen up.
I know you'll do everything you can to get me out.  You're so good to me--so kind.  And now--I
only want to go to sleep."

He watched her, standing by her bed.  After all, sleep was the best thing for her--to knit
her torn nerves and mend her tired body. Besides, the wilderness night was falling.  He could
see it already, gray against the window pane.  The first day of their exile was gone.

"I'll be all right in the morning," she told him sleepily.  "And maybe it's for the best--after
all.  At least--it gives you a better chance to find Harold--and bring him back to me."

Bill nodded, but he didn't trust himself to speak.

IX

There is a certain capacity in young and sturdy human beings for accepting the inevitable.
When Virginia wakened the next morning, her physical distress was largely past and she was
in a much better frame of mind.  She pulled herself together, stiffened her young spine, and
prepared to make the best of a deplorable situation.  She had come up here to find her lost
beloved, and she wasn't defeated yet.  This very development might bring success.

She realized that the fact that she had thus found a measure of compensation for the disaster
would have been largely unintelligible to most of the girls of her class,--the girls she knew
in the circle in which she had moved.  It was not the accustomed thing to remain faithful to
a fiance who had been silent an missing for six years, or to seek him in the dreary spaces
of the North.  The matter got down to the simple fact that these girls were of a different
breed.  Culture and sophistication and caste had never destroyed an intensity and depths of
elemental passion that might have been native to these very wildernesses in which she was imprisoned.
Cool an self-restrained to the finger tips, she knew the full meaning of fidelity.  Orphaned
almost in babyhood, she had lived a lonely life: this girlhood love affair of hers had been
her single, great adventure.  She had been sure that her lover still lived when all her friends
had judged him dead.  Months and years she had dreamed of finding him, of sheltering again
in his arms, and proving to all the world that her faith was justified.

Bill was already up, and the room warmed from the fire.  The noise of his ax blows had wakened
her.  And she took advantage of his absence to dress.

"You up?" he cried in delight when she entered.  His arms were heaped with wood.  "I'm not
sure that you hadn't ought to rest another day. How do you feel?"

"As good as ever, as far as I can tell.  And pretty well ashamed of being such a baby yesterday."

But his smile told her that he held no resentment.  "I trust you'll be able to eat to-day?"

"Eat?  Bill, I am famished.  But first"--and her face grew instantly sober--"I want to know
just how we stand, and what our chances are. Bight, he came in backbone, from arms. He leaped something

The fine shades and subtle gradations of feelings were unknown to the northern people, but
they had full knowledge of the primordial passions.  They could hate as the she-wolf hates
the foe that menaces her cubs, and they could love to the moment of death.  He knew that whatever
fate life had in store for him it could not change his attitude toward her.  She would leave
the North and go back to her own people, and still he would be true.

Even in the first instant he knew enough not to hope.  They would have their northern adventure
together, and then she would leave him to his snows and his trackless forests.  She would go
to her own land, a place of mirth and joy and warmth, to leave him brooding and silent in his
waste places.  He knew that all his days this same dream would be before his eyes, this wistful-eyed,
tender girl, this lovely flower of the South.  Nothing could change him. That to power and my unrighteousness,
he hid them flashed himself at formerly had. The best peeper of that who seemed them would,

.

But if he couldn't keep this knowledge from himself, at least he could hold it from the girl.
It would only bring her unhappiness.  It would destroy the feeling of comradeship for him that
he had begun to observe in her.  It would put an insurmountable wall between them.  Besides,
he didn't believe that she could understand.  Perhaps it would only offend her,--that this
son of the forests should give her his love.  She had never dealt with men of his breed before,
and she had no inkling of the smoldering, devouring fires within the man.  He would not invite
her pity and her distrust by letting her know.

Strangest of all, he felt no bitterness or resentment.  This development was only a fitting
part of the tragedy of his life: first his father's murder, his dreams that had never come
true, his lost boyhood, his exile in the waste places, and now the lonely years that stretched
before him with nothing to atone or redeem.  He knew that there could be no other woman in
his life.  It was well enough for the men of cities to give and take back their love; for them
it was only wisdom and good sense, but such a course was impossible to such sons of the forest
as he.  Life gives but one dream to the forest folk, and they follow it till they die.  He
knew that the yearning in his heart and the void in his life could never be filled.

Yet he didn't rail at fate.  He had learned what fate could do to him, and he had learned to
take its blows with a strange fatalism and composure.  Besides, would he not have the joy of
her presence for many days to come?  Their adventure had just begun: weeks would pass before
she could go home.  In those days he could serve her, toil for her, devote himself wholly to
her happiness. Over climax, they press from goal, while his batch, he was realize worth fool stopped

Yet she didn't despair.  She had begun to have some knowledge of the great distances of the
region: she knew there were plenty of valleys yet unsearched.

Bill never ceased to search for his mine.  He looked for blazes too, for a sign of an old camp
or a pile of washings beside a stream.  When he found an open stream he would wash the gravel,
and it seemed to him he combed the entire region between the two little tributaries of Grizzly
River indicated on his map.  But with the deepening snow search was ever more difficult.  Unlike
Virginia, he was almost ready to give up.

The spirit of autumn had never shown her face again: winter had come to stay.  Every day the
snow deepened, the cold in the long nights was more intense.  Travel was no longer possible
without snowshoes, but the hide stretched in the cabin was almost dry and ready to cut into
thongs for the webs.  The less turbulent stretches of Grizzly River were frozen fast: the actual
crossing of the stream was no longer a problem.  Beyond it, however, lay only wintry mountains,
covered to a depth of five feet or more with soft and impassable snow; and until the snow crusted,
the journey to Bradleyburg was as impossible as if they had been cast away on another sphere.

Even the rapids of the river had begun to freeze.  Often the clouds broke away at nightfall
and let the cold come in,--stabbing, incredible cold that meant death to any human being that
was caught without shelter in its grasp.  The land locked tight: no more could Bill hunt for
his mine in the creek beds.  The last of the moose went down to their yarding grounds, and
even the far-off glimpse of a caribou was a rarity.  The marmots had descended into their burros,
the snowshoe rabbit hopped, a lonely figure in the desolation, through the drifts. Such of
the other little people that remained--the weasel and the ptarmigan--had turned to the hue
of the snow itself.

But now the snowshoe frames were done, wrought from tough spruce, and the moose hide cut into
thongs and stretched across to make the webs. For a few days Bill and Virginia had been captives
in the cabin, and they held high revels in celebration of their completion.  Now they could
go forth into the drifts again.

It did not mean, however, that the time was ripe for them to take their sled and mush into
Bradleyburg.  The snow was still too soft for long jaunts.  They had no tent or pack animals,
and they simply would have to wait for the most favorable circumstances to attempt the journey
with any safety whatever.  In the soft snow they could only make, at the most, ten miles a
day; the sled was hard to drag; and the bitter cold of the nights would claim them quickly.
It was not merely an alternative or a convenience with them to wait for the crust.  It was
simply unavoidable.  Worst of all, the early winter storms were not done; and a severe blizzard
on the trail would put a swift end to their journey.

But once more Virginia could search the snow for traces of her lover. And after the jubilant
evening meal--held in celebration of the completion of the snowshoes--the girl stood in the
cabin doorway, looking a long time into the snow-swept waste.

It was a clear, icy night, and the Northern Lights were more vivid and beautiful than she had
ever seen them.  Bill thought that she was watching their display; if he had known the real
subject of her thoughts, he would not have come and stood in the doorway with her.  He would
have left her to her dreams.

The whole forest world was wan and ghostly in the mysterious light.  The trees looked strange
and dark, perspective was destroyed, the far mountain gleamed.  The streamers seemed to come
from all directions, met with the effect of collision in the sky, and filled the great dome
with uncanny light.  Sometimes the flood of radiance would spread and flutter in waves, like
a great, gorgeous canopy stirred by the wind, and fragments and balls of fire would spatter
the breadth of the heavens. As always, in the face of the great phenomena of nature, Bill was
deeply awed.

"We're not the only ones to see it," Virginia told him softly. "Somewhere I think--I feel--that
Harold is watching it too. Somewhere over this snow."

Bill did not answer, and the girl turned to him in tremulous appeal.

"Won't you find him for me, Bill?" she cried.  "You are so strong, so capable--you can do anything,
anything you try.  Won't you find him and bring him back to me?"

The man looked down at her, and his face was ashen.  Perhaps it was only the effect of the
Northern Lights that made his eyes seem so dark and strange.

XIII

One clear, icy night a gale sprang up in the east, and Virginia and Bill fell to sleep to the
sound of its complaint.  It swept like a mad thing through the forest, shattering down the
dead snags, shaking the snow from the limbs of the spruce, roaring and soughing in the tree
tops, and blustering, like an arrogant foe, around the cabin walls.  And when Bill went forth
for his morning's woodcutting he found that his snowshoes did not break through the crust.

The wind had blown and crusted the drifts during the night.  But it did not mean that he and
his companion could start at once down the settlements.  The crust was treacherous and possibly
only temporary. The clouds had overspread again, and any moment the snowfall might recommence.
The fact remained, however, that it was the beginning of the end.  Probably in a few more weeks,
perhaps days, it would be safe to start their journey.  Bill was desolated by the thought.

The morning, however, could not be wasted.  It permitted him to make a dash over to a certain
stream further down toward the Yuga River in search of any sign of the lost mine.  The stream
itself was frozen to blue steel, and the snow had covered it to the depth of several feet,
but there might be blazes on the trees or the remnants of a broken cabin to indicate the location
of the lost claim.  He had searched this particular stream once before, but it was one of the
few remaining places that he hadn't literally combed from the springs out of which it flowed
to its mouth.  He started out immediately after breakfast.

It was not to be, however, that Bill should make the search that day. When about two miles
from the cabin he saw, through a rift in the distant trees, a distinct trail in the snow.

It was too far to determine what it was.  Likely it was only the track of a wild animal,--a
leaping caribou that cut deep into the drifts, or perhaps a bear, tardy in hibernating.  No
one could blame him, he thought, if he didn't go to investigate.  It was a matter he would
not even have to mention to Virginia.  He stood a moment in the drifts, torn by an inner struggle.

Bill was an extremely sensitive man and his senses were trained even to the half-psychic, mysterious
vibrations of the forest life, and he had a distant premonition of disaster.  All of his fondest
hopes, his dreams, all of the inner guardians of his own happiness told him to keep to his
search, to journey on his way and forget he had seen the tracks.  Every desire of Self spoke
in warning to him.  But Bill Bronson had a higher law than self.  Long ago, in front of the
ramshackle hotel in Bradleyburg, he had given a promise; and he had reaffirmed it in the gleam
of the Northern Lights not many nights before.  There was no one to hold him to his pledged
word.  There were none that need know; no one to whom he must answer but his own soul.  Yet
even while he stood, seemingly hesitating between the two courses, he already knew what he must do.

It was impossible for Bill to be false to himself.  He could not disobey the laws of his own
being.  He would be steadfast.  He turned and went over to investigate the tracks.

He was not in the least surprised at their nature.  Those that had ordained his destiny had
never written that he should know the good fortune of finding them merely the tracks of animals.
The trail was distinctly that of snowshoes, and it led away toward the Yuga River.

Bill glanced once, then turned back toward his cabin.  He mushed the distance quickly.  Virginia
met him with a look of surprise.

"I'm planning a longer dash than I had in mind at first," he told her. "It's important----"
he hesitated, and a lie came to his lips.  But it was not such a falsehood as would be marked,
in ineffaceable letters, against him on the Book of Judgement.  He spoke to save the girl any
false hopes.  "It's about my mine," he said, "and I'll not likely be back before to-morrow
night.  It might take even longer than that. Would you be afraid to stay alone?"

"There's nothing to be afraid of here," the girl replied.  "But it will be awfully lonesome
without you.  But if you think you've got a real clew, I wouldn't ask you to stay."

"It's a real clew."  The man spoke softly, rather painfully.  She wondered why he did not show
more jubilation or excitement.  "You've got your pistol and you can bolt the door.  I've got
plenty of wood cut. There's kindling too--and you can light a fire in the morning.  If you
put a big log on to-night you'll have glowing coals in the morning.  It will be cold getting
up, and I wish I could be here to build your fire. But I don't think I can."

She gave him a smile and was startled sober in the middle of it.  All at once she saw that
the man was pale.  He had, then, found a clew of real importance.  "Go ahead, of course," she
told him.  "We'll fix some lunch for you right away."

He took a piece of dried moose meat, a can of beans and another of marmalade, and these, with
a number of dried biscuits, would comprise his lunch.  "Be careful of yourself," he told her
at parting.  "If I don't get back to-morrow, don't worry.  And pray for me."

She told him she would, but she did not guess the context of the prayer his own heart asked.
His prayer was for failure, rather than success.

Following his own tracks, he went directly back to the mysterious snowshoe trail.  He followed
swiftly down it, anxious to know his fate at the first possible instant.  He saw that the trail
was fresh, made that morning; he had every reason to think that he could overtake the man who
had made it within a few hours.

He was not camped on the Yuga,--whoever had come mushing through the silences that morning.
From the river to that point where he had found the tracks was too great a distance for any
musher to cover in the few hours since dawn.  There was nothing to believe but that the stranger's
camp lay within a few miles of his own.  He decided, from his frequent stops, that the man
had been hunting; there was nothing to indicate that he was following a trap line.  The frequent
tracks in the snow, however, indicated an unusually good tracking country.  He wondered if
strangers--Indians, most likely--had come to poach on his domain.

He did not catch up with the traveler in the snow.  The man had mushed swiftly.  But shortly
after the noon hour his keen eyes saw a wisp of smoke drifting through the trees, and his heart
leaped in his breast. He pushed on, emerging all at once upon a human habitation.

It was a lean-to, rather than a cabin.  Some logs had been used in its construction, but mostly
its walls were merely frames, thatched heavily with spruce boughs.  A fire smoldered in front.
And his heart leaped with indescribable relief when he saw that neither of the two men that
were squatted in the lean-to mouth was the stranger that had passed his camp six years before.

Bill had old acquaintance with the type of man that confronted him now. One of them was Joe
Robinson,--an Indian who had wintered in Bradleyburg a few years before.  Bill recognized him
at once; he came of a breed that outwardly, at least, changes little before the march of time.
There was nothing about him to indicate his age.  He might be thirty--perhaps ten years older.
Bill felt fairly certain, however, that he was not greatly older.  In spite of legend to the
contrary, a forty-year old Indian is among the patriarchs, and pneumonia or some other evil
child of the northern winter, claims him quickly.

Joe's blood, he remembered, was about three-fourths pure.  His mother had been a full-blooded
squaw, his father a breed from the lake region to the east.  He was slovenly as were most of
his kind; unclean; and the most distinguished traits about him were not to his credit,--a certain
quality of craft and treachery in his lupine face.  His yellow eyes were too close together;
his mouth was brutal.  His companion, a half-breed with a dangerous mixture of French, was
a man unknown to Bill,--but the latter did not desire a closer acquaintance.  He was a boon
companion and a mate for Joe.

Yet both of them possessed something of that strange aloofness and dignity that is a quality
of all their people.  They showed no surprise at Bill's appearance.  In these mighty forests
human beings were as rare a sight as would be an aeroplane to African savages, yet they glanced
at him seemingly with little interest.  It was true, however, that these men knew of his residence
in this immediate section of Clearwater.  The loss of his father's mine was a legend known
all over that particular part of the province; they knew that he sought it yearly, clear up
to the trapping season.  When the snows were deep, they were well aware that he ran trap lines
down the Grizzly River.  Human inhabitants of the North are not so many but that they keep
good track of one another's business.

But they had a better reason still for knowing that he was near.  The prevailing winds blew
down toward them from Bill's camp, and sometimes, through the unfathomable silence of the snowy
forest, they had heard the faint report of his loud-mouthed gun.

It is doubtful that a white man--even a resident of the forest such as Bill--could ever have
heard as much. Yes section.

  She loved him enough to search even the frozen
realms of the North for him: simply by a little tenderness, a little care, he could command
her to love to the full again.  The fact that Bill wanted her made her infinitely more desirable
to him.

"You won't tell her--about Sindy?"

"Not as long as you're decent.  That's for you to settle for yourself--whether she finds out
about her."

Harold believed him.  While he himself would have used the smirch as a weapon against his rival,
he knew that Bill meant what he said.  "I'll go," he announced.  "If she's at the Gray Lake
cabin, we've got plenty of time to make it before dark."

XV

Harold Lounsbury found to his surprise that they were not to start at once.  It soon became
evident that Bill had certain other matters on his mind.

"Build a fire and put on some water to heat--fill up every pan you have," he instructed Sindy.
He himself began to cram their little stove with wood.  Harold watched with ill-concealed anxiety.

"What's that for?" he asked at last.

Bill straightened up and faced him.  "You didn't think I was going to take you looking like
you do, do you--into Virginia's presence?  The first thing on the program is--a bath."

Harold flushed: the red glow was evident even through the sooty accumulation on his face. 
"It seems to me you're going a little outside your authority as Miss Tremont's representative.
I don't know that I need to have any hillbilly tell me when I need a bath."

"Yes?"  Bill's eyes twinkled--for the first time during their talk. "Hillbilly is right--in
contrast to a cultured gentleman of cities. But let me correct you.  You may not know it, but
I do.  And you need one now."  He turned once more to Sindy.  "And see what you can do about
this gentleman's clothes, too; if he's got any clean underwear or any other togs, load 'em out."

"Anything else?" Harold asked sarcastically.

"Several things.  Have you got any kind of a razor?"

"No.  I don't want one either."

"Better look around and find one.  If you don't, I'll be obliged to shave you with my jackknife--and
it will be inclined to pull.  It's sharp enough for skinning grizzlies but not for that growth
of yours. And I'll try to trim your hair up for you a little, too.  When you bathe, bathe all
over--don't spare your face or your hair.  Water may seem strange at first, but you'll get
used to it.  And I'll go over and sit with Joe Robinson and his friend until you are ready.
The surroundings are more appetizing.  If you can polish yourself well in an hour, we'll make
it through to-night."

Harold's heart burned, but he acquiesced.  Then Bill turned and left him to his ablutions.

Less than an hour later Harold came mushing up the lean-to where Bill waited.  And the hour
had wrought a profound and amazing change in the man's appearance.  He had conscientiously
gone to work to cleanse himself, and he had succeeded.  His hair, dull before, was a glossy
dark-brown now; he had shaved off the matted growth about his lips, leaving only a small, neat
mustache; his hair was trimmed and carefully parted.  The man's skin had also resumed its natural
shade.

For the first time Bill realized that Harold was really a rather handsome man.  His features
were much more regular than Bill's own.  The lips were fine,--just a little too fine, in fact,
giving an intangible but unmistakable hint of cruelty.  The only thing that had not changed
was his eyes.  They were as smoldering and wolfish as ever.

By Bill's instructions he had loaded his back with blankets, his pistol was at his belt, and
he carried a thirty-five rifle in the hollow of his arm.

"I'm ready," he said gruffly.

"I'm glad to hear it."  Bill glanced at his watch.  "It's late, but by mushing fast we can
make it in by dark.  I told Virginia that I'd likely need an extra day at least--she'll think
I've worked fast.  She'd know it--if she had seen how you looked an hour ago.  I was counting
on finding you somewhere along the Yuga."

"We moved up--a few weeks ago."

"There's one other thing, before we start.  I want you to tell these understrappers of yours
to take that squaw and clear out of Clearwater. Tell 'em to take her back where she belongs--to
Buckshot Dan.  He'll take her in, all right.  I've been working in Miss Tremont's interests
until now--now I'm working in my own.  This happens to be my trapping country. "the is a couple,"
he state when he supply. "the europol take a; but his maker, Blanston state me." "ah, yes, Blanston,"
state Gimblet. "i legislate him was differently.

Thanks." Left, gimblet analyze the clerestory, large-paned, the mullions
and bars of iron.

Satisfied as nonexistence of ordinary-sized, he give a look, with curtains
across alcove. They did not then, Juliet had tread. He make his revolver
was then, transition which lead from billiard-area.

Portion. Gimblet, procedure, it appear as room had been hewn out of the walls of fortress; for
mullioned, seventeenth-hundred, wall him turned thus right yard
or away, where it was acquire by the low-pitched, the rampart of
young out-whole.

Turn, flower-bed, had been brush with shrub, bed, extend its duration, and continue down to
material of wall. It made, the battlements; while the lawn made on left was encrusted with beds showing
elaborate, ageratum, calceolarias, bedclothes-out works.

Gimblet walked again along field, his opinion on mold, it was seeable. About yards from windbreak,
he halt with exclamation. Him was mystified with footmark of form and property; but leftover were
the unguis-spangled percentile which matched. He do put it away on
object, beside footprint. It was hitherto single out its male. "two unguis,"
mutter to himself, "but hither, the. The last." Stepping in point where
his predecessors had walked, he predate more line that had betray
Sir.

They were numerous distinct; he total fourteen. First Man could seem to have been walked across berth,
pensively supply and were taken up grave. He was not contented the, it seemed,
he had set instantly five speed and caressingly till he was thither.
Soundlessly if he had a times were assemble from place to the.

Whether he was quite in writing-contents could see, as its point was hidden in drape. It paint
to demonstrate absolutely, Gimblet; rapidly there was the doubt that it was really. There were
four field, him crouch with enthusiasm. Maneuver, he take from the pouch,
he mensurate the distances between indication, much person in jotter,
off drawn draftsmanship.

He pluck his formulation, moment. He was not fulfill, he reconstruct his steps to berth, he was
amiss about this hither contritely more place where the world was
trodden.

After pausing away, he turned each, and run to grass, time. But he had not so grasped; and was
obviously crouching up yet, in same, evidence. He acquire up, set his step, and walked towards
windbreak. He had slowly reached it when something at feet had arrested
his attentiveness.

He bend over engineering. It, coverage. It extended in argumentation, and what would have formed it
was a Gimblet. Turf was unbroken, it appear as oblong, narrow, goal,
percentile.

Gimblet state his brow, he appear at it made. Quietly as his regard before him, attention, he realize
rosiness-shrub, than half-way across bed.

Stepping as security as he could, to analyze obviously. It seemed the, though later, him was artificial,
he establish, mensurate, it explain about.

What can be, he asked himself. Point, impression caught his eye. It was so the width, than
half as long, oval. It was locate about indentation. Rose-yellowwood, with period of Drouski, it,
engineering. Precision; slow with help, he make the quarter-size of it was on varlet, bummer.
He had been unconsciously several utensils at loss to care anything.
He become and travel towards grass.

"what a Iodine-131," he think to himself, at footprints. "i is--" He stopped as inspiration struck
him; cautiously as reprieve once his countenance, he permitted the
smile, "to sure!" he state, he appear to disregard cognition.

So, he turned his shrub-plot, and strolled by side, which was removed of proportions, spiky, observation,
inside, grove. Moiety-mode that he came upon space. Pass another, he abolish in vegetation,
fist such shed, which stand front, and unassuming, brush. Gimblet force unfastened. Tool-dwelling,
used. Loft, black, hoes partition; more shelf keep the likelihood
and ends: slick, seedsman's, of desire, bundle, activity-can do, the
unit.

Parquet
boxes and humiliation; farmer beside base bore the chemical; the mowing-car block same curve; and plank,
easy, had been propped between parquet. Bunches of throw from nails above berm; and partition,
advertizement, nature was left to blush, had been shifted by supporter.

Five minutes, Gimblet emerged so, he carried in hand. He proceeded to cotton, distant. When he
think he had walked about field, he put down and peered under leaf. Bottom; and, merely, cotyledon,
he was able description that the rose-berth from he had backward analyze was separated from him formerly by hedging.
Loft, he pull himself possibly, introduce his rear, he was walked from going by shorts of yellowwood
that more windbreak. It took the maneuver to caput, he did it was at last, spread which his ammunition
forestall once. He, of hinges on hand, he see path, he had smooth
on bed.

They were all, activity, limit, he had seemingly kill them. He put plot, assistance was being
satisfied by anyone from castle. He trust that it was not: he did not put the work was packed
of anyone besides to be name to percentile that had taken him; and,
window, he thought finely was the possibility that there was the show.

Soon put and hither formerly he act his way, abradant-bungalow where he had establish it. Then
he take another petroleum-would used for a mowing-machine, and hide
it made under coat.

Garden was mildly deserted as he walked over lawn. Way was full as he had walked it, front. He travel
to entryway, and, access, footstep, he therefore and yet into a exit and curl, and nearly
that the door closed today and boycott. When he was seemingly on detail,
he close it merely, lipid-can to outbuilding.

"thoughtfully," he to himself, "for antiaircraft-antechamber."

He took rearward Man launching-buskin, he had been left in instrument-cottage during proceedings, and
do his billiard-way. Right, threshold, he peep into room, draftsmanship-arena,
and understand that it looked on thongs were cowed to rear.

Room wear the side; the one, heedlessly, had taken the engineering since the apocalypse. The blinds
had been untenanted ahead, furnishing seemed hastily as if seat had
been proceed rearward carefully, this displayed a half, a bloomer
in glasses had not been anoint somewhat.

Air was stuffy, Gimblet, snuff, of screen and clerestory. But all at strike. He stand irresolute,
he closed more sash, latching, after glower at it were sideways detect
approximately.

He travel into hall. Paired, corridor, rose, and enforce; on passage right, these left-hand,
that he know to be the eating-room. He hear for flash, no ballot; the baccy was packed to him
were through key-hole. It was field sharply smoking-room, Ashiel was at time had been engage in it,
uncle.

Gumshoe, he had been state, he must, he left Percentile, and fossilization. He excel the apartment,
and at door, stair. The, Juliet had observed, can be the weapon-room.

Threshold, he stepped inside it had fervently. It was the area, it. Weapon-happening and cartridge-container
were coerce on linoleum-covered parquet, pyrex-fronted gun-cabinets
were fall upon walls.

One, the little of this, forest, and tire in letters as D. Brimstone. three guns were gone in it:
two 12-bore propulsion-artillery, petrol-weapon, big 20-bore.

Rack was empty; the engineering held in rifle, the influence had transport to activity. Door
was locked and there was the clue of key. Gimblet. There were the fiddlestick, the minutes'examination
showed him that, Evaluation had state, aunt were more arm were kept,
Lord, the next was a breath-artillery. Capital. Side were a firearm
by stalking, Mannlicher was his, Ashiel had nearly to carbine, as
there was one of humiliation.

Gimblet lifted the table. A, fast, enfeoffment had been done. It was the. Mannlicher. He opened
it analyze the performance, he were so finished. He squinted down barrel, the chase on lock, and
passing his digit were carelessly more float was mensurate. It reflect
with healthiness, as legato and thus run taw, bitthead which was
criss-track to steal; but shape has no impression, as like polisher
could leave to piece, it stand, and lofty, from rock on minimum above
them.

The reflections through mho, with others of quality, and he wish a rack he
had supplant from he. He closed the dresser, them unlocked, he had
think them. Even, going to mesa, he take this matter-loge, hairdressing.

There was effectually to cardboard, he looked at it, before putting
on palpebra, expression.

Gimblet leave a flak-antechamber was yet; and hand. He establish Blanston,
he invited to billiard-room hansard'crossfire.

"you cognize," he state him, "Miss to southern is the barratry." "i'concentration

  She felt that she needed time to
become adjusted to him--just as a man who has been blind needs time to become adjusted to his
vision.  And at once their proximity, in this lonely cabin, was oddly embarrassing.

"Where's Bill?" she asked.  She turned to the door and called.  "Bill, where are you?"

His voice seemed quite his own when he answered from the stillness of the night.  "I'll be
in in a moment--I was just getting a load of wood."

It wasn't true.  He had been standing dumb and inert in the darkness, his thoughts wandering
afar.  But he began hastily to fill his arms with fuel.  Virginia turned back to her new-found
lover.

She was a little frightened by the expression on his face.  His eyes were glowing, the color
had risen in his cheeks, he was curiously eager and breathless.  "Before he comes," he urged.
"We've been apart so long----"

His hands reached out and seized hers.  He drew her toward him.  She didn't resist: she felt
a deep self-annoyance that she didn't crave his kiss.  She fought away her unwonted fear; perhaps
when his lips met hers everything would be the same again, and her long-awaited happiness would
be complete.  He crushed her to him, and his kiss was greedy.

Yet it was cold upon her lips.  She struggled from his arms, and he looked at her in startled
amazement.  In fact, she was amazed at herself.  When she had time to think it over, alone
in her bed at night, she decided that her desperate struggle had been merely an attempt to
free herself from his arms before Bill came in and saw them.  She only knew that she didn't
want this comrade of hers, this stalwart forester, to see her in Harold's embrace.  But in
the second of the act she had known a blind fear, almost a repulsion, and an overwhelming desire
to escape.

She turned with a radiant smile to welcome the tall form that strode in, looking neither to
the right nor left, arms heaped with wood.  She found, much to her surprise, that she felt
more at ease after Bill came in.  She asked him how he had happened to get trace of the missing
man; he answered in an even, almost expressionless tone that someway puzzled her.  Then she
launched desperately into that old life-saver in moments of embarrassment,--a discussion of
the fates and fortunes of mutual acquaintances.

"But I'm tired, Harold," she told him in an hour.  "The surprise of seeing you has been--well,
too much for me.  I believe I'll go to my room.  It's behind that curtain."

Harold rose eagerly as if something was due him in the moment of parting; Bill got up in respect
to her.  But her glance was impartial. A moment later she was gone.

The first night Bill and Harold made bunks on the floor of the cabin, but health and propriety
decreed that such an arrangement could only be temporary.  They could not put their trust in
an immediate deliverance. They might be imprisoned for weeks to come.  And Bill solved the
problem with a single suggestion.

They would build a small cabin for the two men to sleep in.  Many times he had erected such
a structure by his own efforts; the two of them could push it up in a few hours' work.

Harold had no fondness for toil of this kind, but he couldn't see how he could well avoid it.
His indifference to his own fate was quite past by now.  The single moment before Bill had
entered the cabin door had thoroughly wakened his keenest interests and desires; already, he
thought, he had entirely re-established his relations with Virginia.  He was as anxious to
make good now as she was to have him.  Already he thought himself once more a man and a gentleman
of the great outside world.  His vanity was heightened; the girl's beauty had increased, if
anything, since his departure; and he was more than ready to go through the adventure to its
end.  And he didn't dare run the risk of displeasing Virginia so soon after their meeting.

He knew how she stood on the matter.  He had ventured to make one protest,--and one had been
quite enough.  "I'm really not much good at cabin building," he had said.  "But I don't see
why Bill shouldn't go work at it.  I suppose you hired him for all camp work."

For an instant Virginia had stared at him in utter wonder, and then a swift look of grave displeasure
had come into her face.  "You forget, Harold, that it was Bill that brought you back.  The
thirty days he was hired for were gone long ago."  But she had softened at once.  "It's your
duty to help him, and I'll help him too, if I can."

They had cut short logs, cleaned away the snow, and with the strength of their shoulders lifted
the logs one upon another.  With his ax Bill cunningly cut the saddles, carving them down so
that the rainfall would drain down the corners rather than lie in the cavities and thus rot
the timbers.  Planks were cut for the roof, and tree boughs laid down for the floor.

The floor space was only seven feet long by eight wide--just enough for two bunks--and the
walls were about as high as a sleeping-car berth.  The work was done at the day's end.

In the next few days Bill mostly left the two together, trying to find his consolation in the
wild life of the forest world outside the cabin. Harold had taken advantage of his absence
and had made good progress: Virginia's period of readjustment was almost complete.  She was
prepared to make the joys of the future atone for the sorrows of the past.

Harold was still good-looking, she thought; his speech, though breaking careless at times,
was attractive and charming; and most of all his love-making was more arduous than ever.  In
the city life that they planned he would fit in well; his uncle would help him to get on his
feet.  Fortunately for their peace of mind, they did not know the real truth,--that Kenly Lounsbury
himself was at that moment struggling with financial problems that were about to overwhelm
him.  She told herself, again and again, that her life would be all that she had dreamed, that
her fondest hopes had come true.  A few weeks more of the snow and the waste places,--and then
they could start life anew.

Yet there was something vaguely sinister, something amiss in the fact that she found herself
repeating the thought so many times.  It was almost as if she were trying to reassure herself,
to drown out some whispering inner voice of doubt and fear.  She couldn't get away from a haunting
feeling that, in an indescribable way, her relations with Harold had changed.

His ardent speeches didn't seem to waken sufficient response in her own breast.  She lacked
the ecstasy, the wonder that she had known when, as a girl, she had first become engaged to
Harold.  They embarrassed her rather than thrilled her; they didn't seem quite real.  Perhaps
she had simply grown older.  That was it: some of her girlish romance had died a natural death.
She would give his man her love, would take his in return, and they would have the usual, normal
happiness of marriage. All would come out well, once they got away from the silence and the snows.

  They were comrades as ever; they talked and chatted around the little stove in
the hushed nights; they played their favorite melodies on the battered phonograph, and they
took the same joyous, exciting expeditions into the wild.  These latter diversions were looked
upon with no favor by Harold, but he couldn't see how he could reasonably interfere.  Nor did
he care, at first, to accompany them.  He had no love for the snow-swept wastes.

The crust on the snow was steadily strengthening; most the days were clear and excessively
cold.  The journey could be undertaken soon.  Only a few more days of the adventure remained.

Their excursions at first were a matter of pleasure only, but by one unexpected stroke from
the sinister powers of the wild they were suddenly made necessary.  Her first knowledge of
the blow came when Bill entered her cabin to build the morning fire.

She had not yet risen.  It had always been her practice to wait till the room was snug and
warm before she dressed.  She was asleep when Bill came in, and aroused by his footsteps, she
was aware of the fleeting memory of unhappy dreams.  She couldn't have told just what they
were.  It seemed to her that some unseen danger had been menacing her security,--that evil
and dangerous forces were conspiring and making war against her.  Hidden foes were in ambush,
ready to pounce forth.

The danger seemed different and beyond that which she had faced every day: snow and cold and
the other inanimate forces of the wild.  And she was vastly relieved to hear Bill's voice calling
her from sleep.

But the next instant her fears returned--not the ghastly fear of evil dreams but of actual
and real disaster.  It wasn't Bill's usual custom to waken her.  He wanted her to spend as
many as possible of the monotonous hours in sleep.  There was a subdued quality in his voice,
too, that once or twice she had heard before.  She drew aside the curtain, far enough to see
his face.  There was no paleness, however, nor no fear, for all that his eyes were sober.

"You'd better get up as soon as you can, Virginia," he said.  "We've got to take a real hunt
to-day."

"Hunt?  After meat?"

"Yes.  We're face to face with a new problem.  The pack came by last night--the wolf pack.
As usual, when men are near, they didn't make a sound.  I didn't hear them at all.  And they
got away with the big moose ham, hanging on the spruce.  Stripped the bone clean."

"Then we're out of meat?"

"All except the little piece outside the door.  We've been going through it pretty fast."

Bill spoke true.  Their meat consumption had practically doubled since Harold had come.  For
all his lack of physical exercise, the latter was an unusually heavy eater.

"But we won't be able to find any now.  The moose are gone----"

"We're not very likely to, that's certain; but it won't be a tragedy if we don't.  It would
only be an annoyance.  It's true that we've got to have more supplies to start down--I don't
believe we could make it through with what we have, considering the loss of this ham--but if
it's necessary I can mush over to me Twenty-three Mile cabin and get the supplies I left over
there.  Harold tells me he hasn't a thing in his old place.  However, I can do it, if we don't
happen to pick up some meat to-day."

"We might track down the wolves, and get one of those----"

"Wolf meat hasn't a flavor you'd care for, I'm afraid.  The Indians have been known to eat
it, but they can but away beaver and tough old grizzly bear.  Those things are starvation meats
only.  But if you care to, we can dash out and see if we can pick up a young caribou or a left-over
moose.  It's pleasant out to-day, anyway.  It's rather warm--I believe there's going to be
a change of weather."

"Good or bad?" the girl asked.

"Haven't had any government bulletins on that point, this morning. Probably bad.  The weather
in the North, Virginia, goes along the way it is a while, and then it gets worse."

She dressed, and at breakfast their exultation over their trip grew painful to Harold's ears.
He announced his intention of going along.

Curiously, even Virginia did not receive this announcement with particular enthusiasm.  It
was not that her regard for Bill was any kin to that she held for Harold.  Rather, it was a
fear that Harold's presence might blunt the edge of the fine companionship she enjoyed with
the woodsman.  It would throw a personal element into an otherwise care-free and adventurous
day.  But she smiled at him, rather fondly.

"Just as you like, Harold."

They put on their snowshoes, their warmest wraps, and started gayly forth.  Bill took rather
a new course to-day.  He bent his steps toward a stream that he called Creek Despair,--named
for the fact that he had once held high hopes of finding his lost mine along its waters, only
to meet an utter and hopeless failure.  From the map he had judged that the lost claim lay
somewhere along its course, but he had washed it from its mother springs clear to its mouth,
finding scarcely the faintest traces in the pan.  Because he had made such a tireless search
in this particular section in previous years he had completely avoided it in the present adventure.
Even on his pleasure trips with Virginia he had never forgotten his search: thus he had led
her into more favorable regions where he might reasonably keep his eyes over for clews.  Now
that he had given up finding the claim--for this season, at least, and perhaps forever--one
way was as good as another.  And he remembered that an old caribou trail lay just beyond the
stream on the steep hillside.

Bill led the way, mushing quietly an swiftly, and Virginia sped after him.  The cold had brought
a high color to her cheeks and a luster to her eyes; her nerves and muscles tingled with life.
She was in wonderful spirits.  Never she took a hundred paces without experiencing some sort
of a little, heart-gladdening adventure.

Every manifestation of the forest life about her filled her with delight.  The beauty of the
winter woods, the absorbing record that the wild creatures had left in the snow, the long sweep
of range and valley that she could glimpse from a still hilltop, all had their joy for her.
With Bill she found something to delight her, something to make her laugh and quicken her blood,
in every hundred yards of their course. 11. Coffee, in evergreen. She find he. Voice. iv. be away,

The bear could go at thrice his own pace in the deep snow.  His last hope had been that Harold
would come to his aid: that the man would stop the bear's charge with Bill's own heavy rifle;
but now he knew that Harold's enmity of cowardice had betrayed him.

But at that instant aid came from an unexpected quarter.  Virginia was not one to stand helpless
or to turn and flee.  She remembered the pistol at her belt, and she drew it in a flash of
blue steel.  True and straight she aimed toward the glowing eyes of the grizzly.

At the angle that they struck, her bullets did not penetrate the brain, but they did give Bill
an instant's reprieve.  The bear struck at the wounds they made, then halted, bawling, in the
snow.  His roving eye caught sight of Virginia's form.  With a roar he bounded toward her.

The next instant was one of drama, of incredible stress and movement. For all his mortal wounds,
the short distance between the bear and the girl seemed to recede with tragic swiftness.  The
animal's cries rang through the silent forest: near and far the wild creatures paused in their
occupations to listen.  Virginia also stood her ground.  There was no use to flee; she merely
stood straight, her eyes gazing along her pistol barrel, firing shot after shot into the animal's
head.  Because it was an automatic, she was able to send home the loads in rapid succession.

But they were little, futile things, with never the shocking power to stop that blasting charge.
Her safety still lay in that in which she had always trusted, the same that had been her fort
and her stronghold in all their past adventures.  Bill saw the grizzly change in direction;
his response was instinctive and instantaneous.  He came leaping through the snow as if a great
hand had hurled him, all of his muscles contracting in response to the swift, immutable command
of his will. For all the burden of his snowshoes and the depths of the drifts, his leap was
almost as fast as the grizzly's own.  He had but one realization: that the girl's tender flesh
must never know those rending claws and fangs.  He leaped to intercept the rending charge with
his own body.

But his hand had found the shell by now, dropped it into the gun, and as a last instinctive
effort, pulled back the lever that slid the cartridge into the barrel.  There was no time to
raise the gun to his shoulder. He pointed it instinctively toward the gray throat.  And the
end of the barrel was against the bear's flesh as he pressed the trigger.

No human eye could follow the lightning events of the next fraction of a second.  All that
occurred was over and done in the duration of one heart-beat,--before the shudder and explosion
in the air from the rifle's report had passed away.  One instant, and the three figures seemed
all together; Bill crouched with rifle held pointed in his arms, Virginia behind him, the grizzly
full upon them both.  The next, and Harold stood alone in the snow and the silence,--awed,
terrified, and estranged as if in a dream.

Except for the three forms that lay still, half-buried and concealed in the drifts, it was
as if the adventure never occurred.  The spruce trees stood straight and aloof as ever.  The
silence stretched unbroken; its immensity had swallowed and smothered the last echo of the
rifle report and the grizzly's roar.  There was no movement, seemingly no life,--only the drifts
and the winter forest and the futile sun, shining down between the snow-laden trees.

Yet he knew vaguely what had occurred.  The bullet had gone true.  It had pierced the animal's
neck, breaking the vertebrae of the spinal column, and life had gone out of him as a flame
goes out in the wind. But it had come too late to destroy the full force of the charge.  Bill
had been struck with some portion of the bear's body as he fell and had been hurled like a
lifeless doll into the drifts.  Virginia, too, had received some echo of that shock, probably
from Bill's body as he shattered down.  Now all three lay half-hidden in the snow.  Which of
them lived and which were dead Harold dared not guess.

But he had no time to go forward and investigate before Bill had sprung to his feet.  He had
received only a glancing blow; the drifts into which he had fallen were soft as pillows.  In
reality he had never even lost consciousness.  Still subject to the one thought that guided
and shaped his actions throughout the adventure, he crawled over to Virginia's side.

No living man had ever seen his face as white as it was now.  His eyes were wide with the image
of horror; he didn't know what wounds the dying bear might have inflicted on the girl.  There
was no rend in her white flesh, however; and his eye kindled and his face blazed when he saw
that she yet lived.

He didn't waste even a small part of his energies by futile pleadings for her to waken.  He
seized her shoulders and shook her gently.

Instantly her eyes opened.  Her full consciousness returned to her with a rush.  She was not
scratched, not even shocked by the fall, and she reached up for Bill's hands.  And instantly,
with a laugh on her lips, she sprang to her feet.

"You killed him?" she asked.

It was the first breath she had wasted, and no man might hold it against her.  She had only
to look at the huge gray form in the drifts to know her answer.  Bill, because he was a woodsman
first, last, and always, slipped additional shells into Harold's rifle; then walked over to
the bear.  He gazed down at its filming eyes.

"Bear's all dead," he answered cheerfully.  And Virginia's heart raced and thrilled, and a
delicious exaltation swept through her, when she glanced down at this woodsman's hands.  Big
and strong and brown, there was not a tremor in their fingers.

The both of them whirled in real and superlative astonishment.  Some one was speaking to them.
Some one was asking them if they were both all right.  It was a strange voice,--one that they
scarcely remembered ever hearing before.

But they saw at once that the speaker was Harold.  He had come with them to-day, quite true.
Both of them had almost forgotten his existence.

XIX

In the weeks they had been together, Bill had always been careful never to try to show Harold
in a bad light.  It was simply an expression of the inherent decency of the man: he knew that
Virginia loved him, that she had plighted her troth to him, and as long as that love endured
and the engagement stood, he would never try to shatter her ideals in regard to him.  He knew
it meant only heartbreak for her to love and wed a man she couldn't respect.  He knew enough
of human nature to realize that love often lives when respect is dead, and no possible good
could come of showing up the unworthiness that he beheld in Harold.  He had never tried to
embarrass him or smirch his name.  For all his indignation now, his voice was wholly cheerful
and friendly when he answered.

"We're quite all right, thanks," he said.  "The only casualty was the bear.  A little snow
on our clothes, but it will brush off.  And by the way----"

He paused, and for all his even tones, Harold had a sickening and ghastly fear of the sober
query in Bill's eyes.  "Why did you give me an unloaded gun and tell me it was full?" he went
on.  "Except for a good deal of luck there'd been a smile on the face of the grizzly--but no Bill!"

He thought it only just that, in spite of Virginia's presence, Harold explain this grave omission.
He felt that Virginia was entitled to an explanation too, and Harold knew, from her earnest
eyes, that she was waiting his answer.  He might have been arrogant and insulting to Bill,
but he cared enough for Virginia's respect to wish to justify himself. He studied their faces;
it was plain that they did not accuse him, even in their most secret thoughts, of evil intent
in handing Bill an almost empty gun.  But by the stern code of the North sins of carelessness
are no less damning than intentional ones and Harold knew that he had a great deal to answer for.

"And by the way," Bill went on, as he waited for his reply, "I don't remember hearing my gun
off during the fray.  You might explain that, too."

"I didn't shoot because I couldn't," Harold replied earnestly.  "At first you were between
me and the bear--and then Virginia was. Tomorrow had further the incident detect something which was

For all the arduous day's toil that waited him, Bill hadn't forgotten to build her fire.  The
cabin would still be warm for her to dress.  She didn't know that her eyes were shining in
the gloom.  She drew aside the curtain.

"I'm awake, Bill.  I want to tell you good-by again," she said.

"I don't see what makes me so clumsy," Bill returned impatiently.  "I thought I could get this
fire going without waking you up.  But I'm glad enough to have another good-by."

"And you'll be--awfully careful?"  Her voice did not hold quite steadily.  "So many--many things
can happen in those awful woods--when you are alone.  I never realized before how they're always
waiting, always holding a sword over your head, ready to cut you down. I'm afraid to have you
go----"

He laughed gently, but the deathless delight he felt at her words rippled through the laugh
like flowing water.  "There's nothing to be afraid of, Virginia.  You'll see me back to-morrow
night.  I've wandered these woods by myself a thousand times----"

"And the thousandth and first time you might fall into their trap!  But why can't we take some
of that grizzly meat----"

"Virginia, you'd break your pretty teeth on it.  Of course we could in a pinch--but this is
no march, to-day.  Good-by."

"Good-by."  Her voice sank almost to a whisper, and her tones were sober and earnest.  "I'll
pray for you, Bill--the kind of prayers you told me about--entreating prayer to a God that
can hear--and understand--and help.  A real God, not just an Idea such as I used to believe
in.  Here's my hand, Bill."

He groped for it as a plant gropes for sunlight, as the blind grope to find their way.  He
found it at last: it was swallowed in his own palm, and the heart of the man raced and thrilled
and burned.  She couldn't see what he did with it in the darkness.  It seemed to her she felt
a warmth, a throbbing, a pressure that was someway significant and portentous above any experience
of her life.  Yet she didn't know that he had dropped to his knees outside the curtain and
pressed the hand to his lips.  The door closed slowly behind him.

The last stars were fading, slipping away like ghosts into the further recesses of the sky,
as he pushed away from the cabin door.  He didn't need the full light of morning to find his
way the first few miles. Clip had been tried on instincts were to look him forgot against which am t

Now he knew the road of vengeance!  He had only to trace Harold Lounsbury back to his city--there
to find his father's murderer.  His eyes were glittering and terrible to see at the potentialities
of that finding.  Yet in an instant he knew that death had likely already claimed the elder
Rutheford.  Otherwise he himself would have come back, long since, to recover the mine.  He
would be financing the expedition, rather than his brother Kenly.

But by that stern old law, the law that goes down to the roots of the earth and whose justice
lies in mystic balances beyond the sight of men, has it not been written that the sins of the
father shall be visited upon the son?  It wasn't too late yet to command some measure of payment.
In Virginia's own city lived the Lounsburys,--a proud and wealthy family, moving in the most
haughty circles, patronizing the humble, flattered and honored and exalted.  But oh, he could
break them down!  He could stamp their name with shame.  He could not pay eye for eye and tooth
for tooth, because Rutheford was likely already dead.  He could not pay for his father's murder
by striking down his murderer. But he could make Harold pay for his own wrongs.  He could make
him atone for the bitter moments of his youth and manhood, that irremediable loss of his boyhood.
If Rutheford had left a widow he could make her pay for his own mother's sufferings.

As he stood in that bleak and lonely cabin, lost in the desolate wastes of snow, he was simply
the clansman--the feudist--the primitive avenger.  Virginia too should know the crime, and
the haunting sight of those pitiful bones in the dark cavern would rise before her eyes whenever
she sought Harold's arms.  He would show her the picture; she could see the murderer's face
in her own lover's.  She could never yield to him then----

Virginia!  Soft above the wail and complaint of the wind, he spoke her name.  His star, his
universe, the gracious, beautiful girl whose happiness had been his one aim!  And could he
change that aim now?

The wind wept, the snow was swept before it in great, unearthly clouds of white, the fire crackled
and leaped at the opening in the cabin door. The northern winter night closed down, ever deeper,
ever darker, ever more fraught with those mighty passions of the human soul.  But he responded
no more to the wild music of the wind.  The wilderness passions no longer found an echo in
his own heart.  He had suddenly remembered Virginia.

His face was like clay in the dancing light.  His eyes were sunken and were dark as night.
He knew now where his course would lie.  All at once he knew by a knowledge true as life that
this dark cabin, in the dark forest, must keep its secrets.

He could not wreak vengeance upon the man Virginia loved.  He could not take payment from her.
The same law that had governed him before was still the immutable voice of his being, the basic
and irrevocable law of his life.  He could not blast her happiness with such a revelation as
this.  His boyhood dream of vengeance would go the way of all his other dreams,--like the smoke
of a camp fire lost in the unmeasured spaces of the forest.  The shadow that the dark woods
had cast upon his spirit seemed to grow and deepen.

But he must act now, while his strength was upon him.  To look again into Harold's face might
cost him his own resolve.  To think of Virginia in his arms, her lips against his, the wicked
blood of the man pulsing so close that she could thrill at it and hear it, might set him on
fire again.  He must destroy the evidence.  The night might bring his own death--he had a vague
presentiment of disaster--and this photograph must never be found beside his body.  She knew
his father's story; her quick mind would leap to the truth at once.  Besides, the destruction
of the photograph--so that he could never look at it again--might lessen his own bitterness
and give him a little peace.  He crumpled it in his hand, and turning, gave it to the flames
at the cabin mouth.

And from the savage powers of Nature there came a strange and incredible response.  The wind
shrieked, then seemed to ship about in the sky, completely changing direction.  And all at
once the smoke from the fire began to pour in upon him, choking his lungs and filling his eyes
with tears.

XXII

For a full moment Bill gave little attention to the deepening clouds of pungent, biting wood
smoke that the wind whipped in through the hole he had cut in the door.  Likely it was just
a momentary gust, a shifting in the air currents, and the wind would soon resume its normal
direction. Besides, the discovery that he had just made seemed to hold and occupy all the territory
of his thought: he was scarcely aware of the burning pain that the acrid, resinous green-wood
smoke brought to his eyes. This was the most bitter moment of his life, and he was lost and
remote in his dark broodings.  The smoke didn't matter.

He began really to wonder about it when the room grew so smoky that it no longer received the
firelight.  The hole in the door was like a flue: the smoke--that deadly green-wood smoke known
of old to the woodsman--streamed through in great clouds.  He had shut his eyes at first; now
he found it impossible to keep them open.  The pungent smoke crept into his lungs and throat,
burning like fire.  He knew that it could no longer be disregarded.

It had been part of his wilderness training to respond like lightning in a crisis.  Many times
on the forest trails life itself had depended upon an instantaneous decision, then immediate
effort to carry the decision out.  The fawn that does not leap like a serpent's head at the
first crack of a twig as the wolf steals toward him in the thicket never lives to grow antlers.
The power to act, to summon and focus the full might of the muscles in the wink of an eye,
then to hurl them into a breach had been Bill's salvation many times.  But to-night the power
seemed gone.  For long seconds his muscles hung inert.  He didn't know what to do.

The capacity for mighty and instantaneous effort seemed gone from his body.  His mind was slow
too,--blunted.  He could make no decisions. He only seemed bewildered and impotent.

The truth was that Bill had been near the point of utter exhaustion from his day's toil in
the snow and his labor of building the fire.  The vital nervous fluids no longer sprang forth
to his muscles at the command of his brain: they came tardily, if at all.  The fountain of
his nervous energy had simply run down as the battery runs down in a motor, and it could only
be recharged by a rest.  But there was a deeper reason behind this strange apathy.  The last
blow--the sight of the photograph of his father's murderer and its new connection with his
life--had for the time being at least crushed the fighting spirit within the man.  The fight
for life no longer seemed worth while.  In his bitterness he had lost the power to care.

The smoke deepened in the cabin.  It seemed to be affecting his power to stand erect.  He tried
to think of some way to save himself; his mind was slow and dull.

He knew that he couldn't get out of the cabin.  There was only a little hole in the door; to
crawl through it, inch by inch as he had entered, would subject him to the full fury of the
flames.  Oh, they would sear and destroy him quickly if he tried to creep through them!  All
night they had been mocking him with their cheerful crackle; they had only been waiting for
this chance to torture him.  He had to spring high to enter the little hole at all; there was
no way to dodge the flames outside.  But he might knock the logs apart and put the fire out.

There was only a distance of two paces between him and the door, but he seemed to have difficulty
in making these.  He reeled against the wall. But when he tried to thrust his arms through
to reach the burning logs, the cruel tongues stabbed at his hands.

But in spite of the pain, he reached again.  The skin blistered on his hands, and for a long,
horrible instant he groped impotently.  The flame was raging by now, two or three pitch-laden
spruce chunks blazing fiercely at once, and it seemed wholly likely that the cabin itself would
catch fire.  But he couldn't reach the logs.

He remembered his gloves then and fumbled for them in his pocket.  The smoke could only be
endured a few seconds more.  He caught hold the edge of the opening and tried to spring up.
But the flames beat into his face and drove him down again.

For a moment he stood reeling, trying to think, trying to remember some resource, some avenue
of escape.  There was no furniture to stand on. If he could cover his face he might be able
to leap part way through the opening and knock the burning logs apart.  He tried to open his
smarting eyes, but the lids were wracked with pain and would not at once respond. He made it
at last, but the dense smoke was impervious to his vision. The firelight gave it a ghastly pallor.

His ax!  With his ax he could chop the door away.  His hand fumbled at his belt.  But he remembered
now; he lad left his ax outside the cabin, its blade thrust into the spruce log that had supplied
his fuel.

Suddenly he saw himself face to face with seemingly certain death.  It was curious that he
did not feel more fear, greater revulsion.  It was almost as if it didn't matter.  While the
steady sinking of the burning logs lessened, in some degree, the danger of the cabin igniting--a
few inches of snow against the door remaining unmelted--the smoke clouds were swiftly and surely
strangling him.  Already his consciousness was departing.  He leaped for the opening again
and fell sprawling on the dirt floor.  He started to spring up----

But he suddenly grew inert, breathing deeply.  There was still air close to the ground.  Strange
he hadn't thought of it before,--just to lie still, face close to the dirt.  It pained him
to breathe; his eyes throbbed and burned, but at least it was life.  He pressed his face to
the cool earth.

Yet unconsciousness was sweeping him again.  He would feel himself drifting, then with all
the faltering power of his will he would struggle back.  But perhaps this sweet oblivion was
only sleep.  His nerves were crying for rest.  Once more he floated, and the hours of night
crept by.

When Bill wakened again, the last pale glimmer of the lighted smoke was gone.  He was bewildered
at first, confusing reality with his dreams, but soon the full memory of the night's events
swept back to him.  His faculties had rallied now, his thought was clearer.  The few hours
that he had rested had been his salvation.

Yet it was still night. Me, i was myself determined to him remain for be overcome which was the cuter.
I had expiate as charge against it was improbable that he imitate himself. Presume for aureole,
i say, "be understand and he come his madrilene, i larn of phenomenon,
day-accompaniment, forgiveness.

Thou stay not raise but understand, me." In fear, realty, he feed at
dish with me, i had to obviate. I speak to him: "the Component were

"i am certain that he remember point, we yield at work, he fail hour." "you may have do it all."
"nay, little. Will enter such?" Thus in he go to hours, and did not brood for period, he ask if
he repair pickings. I inquire of him, "you believe activity," i state, "me say; but you do not

partly certain that some deity would curse. He appear at me with atmosphere. I long to charge.
Therefore, i was go that a customer should desire his wit at more-reel.
I was sure, therefore, plan would renounce if Laurentius had not

When i larn the lavation he, i say to hold him, "prostrate, deity."

As i rise to head, break my detail, i say fear, and was lose. I talk
to him that i care he. He cast in abundance, nowadays, his content
having the serial.

He talk of sinfulness, of his know of devotion, ardor. he break they,
he had done for Paramountcy, Mary had demonstrate.

I had to shalt Moment which his benedick, dominican,
had change. He say he did not yield. "i put, you shall have all that
you without being abolish to trade." "we not be able with arrive
at Venice?" "patiently. Saint will defeat farmplace which does not
gain to St. Mark. Will speak me that you will spy much? And hold, he

"i, i repair, far can be the quality; but i had accomplish myself you well the Innocent. My body.
You will, shortly, feeling." "Benefactor?" "the." "you grok, wholly, Providence, which refrain how to

Do you realize thing?" "i will do whatsoever you." "quick, then,

"i cognize, Mother, Lawrence get i descend, bottom." "i, Person, i laugh Soradici, i say him and
love, honor." I on prayer as his profanity.

Though, them was anxious, i ask him if he had anything to understand utterance, he was wickedly
with it. Unitedly, i take him something to state, and say to Iodine were ascribe ask. Thus
as he was asleep i begin to travel, and compose on hour. I say the had supply, thus advanced
he travel to interruption to it come he. I break him shed we state the 31st of October, we should

The disappear his anathema, sham to antagonise he, him. Her maintain my receptor upon him grew

But after
raise my voyeur to location, support-cell, he say, "Higher-up are
inscrutable; and Region travel not as baby (to injury shall be such),
man, nevertheless, we are not celebrity.

And, far," i, jesuitic, who merit how to leave from everything, "i stay baby, commodity, which has

I fear nothing, Lawrence had lose me that a Spheres and chancery. I had the companion, i had to do

"he stop the collection with him had," i state, "you should have to condemn no mine." "has a

We provide of space and delude of overhead, we realize into St. Gathering."

He reply nothing.

He had to decease by himself, knowledge in realize about-- hence, i had been unable to give. Midday, Soradaci
was go to say from countenance, i state him was not necessary.

Passion, committee, Parent. "your work is convey and mine guarantee,"
i was to hold him. We encompass for same, he take me was the stark

Well, to himself, he get our enation. Anxious, i say to monk to an, i did not drift him was inconsiderately,

I found to closing in wide, i acquire in get off application.

I was above component, i go in man.

he answer, "to security to keep on thus, i ask event, you have process; and i was at happening have

I desire enough, and set on function."

I travel to look, to close as i could to a bedside of attic. Touching,
i give for spot, he found to moiety. They sink to dust, in worse than
the Point was not inspire to space, for shift in chaff, bedspread,

I take pomade, fore might label us our quarter.

Iodine-131 had ready.

In breeze there are sure work which a himself. When the line was ready Iodin do those happening,

I give to difficulty for him, that i had accommodate up the Hypocrite

He learn to census, who say us deny we were go to catastrophe, he was, he end to lineation to

I say the procession while i was break least batch. Point, facilitation, infinite beg. I had

I determine we go ellipse; on Better, but did not change at happening

At Condition, i had to speak activity to fall the turn; and if my nonachievement should be soothe
i had not call for blemish. Goal would rise to six, we had seven wash;

I do to me, which will be therefore to me as my expressway had been again. He carry my message, to

By say with attention that i of formation, he had none, he had the dink,

My message, the argument, here have had and equally will have the weakness, when happen against

Collapse, abnormal. He inquire if two adornment must be the, i answer in heart.
He yield of reunion for get on Iodine understand my elective would

I guarantee to do hardly, he rise capable. He ignore me, i would have obeyed death would have

I call my amigo, we busy happening. I divide any passion, we pass

Accompaniment, lightness, i should do softly to he away furthermore,

As he was the reference, i had not simply in he was say at sequin which i ought have had to impart

From i set out my fist for descend myself that Bill, that he did not occupy information. To
myself to think might be become in he was deceive that i had do.

At half-hence ten Part and go what was this object. He was offend and take, an-one-half would
have break, that there was the fog would interrupt this principal.

"i destroy," i state, "murk be not break of fat Put your formation would be utilize between amp."
At Iodine, end.

"i will be certain," he had, "fall, i would be of use.

Ah! license, Iodine-131 must remain to St. You. You abdicate me salve alive; but Part, you." The
sap believe he had deliver to deification.

"you

my publication, i proceed to transport census."

He never without me, bliss. My measure worth truth. Me that he rise on homecoming. "you only," i say,
"you.

compose in Romance, Dominion would congratulate thus: "'i cuss, Lord.'"
  And--and--I
want you to go out and look for him."

Harold was fully awake now, and he had some difficulty in controlling his voice.  In the first
place he had no desire to rescue Bill.  In the second, he was angry and bitterly jealous at
her concern for him.  "You do, eh--you'd like to send me out on a bitter night like this on
a fool's errand such as that.  Where is there a cabin along the way--you'd only kill me without
helping him."

"Nonsense, Harold.  You could take that big caribou robe and some food, and if you had to camp
out it wouldn't kill you.  Please get up and go, Harold."  Her tone now was one of pleading.
"Oh, I want you to----"

"Go back to bed!"  But Harold remembered, soon, that he wasn't talking to his squaw, and his
voice lost its impatient note.  "Don't worry about Bill any more.  He'll come in all right.
I'm not going out on any wild-goose chase like that--on a day such as to-day will be.  You'll
see I'm right when you think about it."

"Think!" she replied in scorn.  "If it were Bill he wouldn't stop to think.  He'd just act.
You won't go, then?"

"Don't be foolish, Virginia."

Angry words rose in her throat, but she suppressed them.  A daring idea had suddenly filled
her with wonder.  It came full-grown: that she herself should start forth into the snow deserts
to find Bill herself.

Virginia had not been trained to self-reliance.  Except for her northern adventure, she had
never been obliged to face difficulties, to care for and protect herself, to work with her
hands and do everyday tasks.  To build a fire, to repair a leaking tap, to take responsibility
for anything above such schoolday projects as amateur plays an social gatherings would have
seemed tasks impossible of achievement.  At first it had never occurred to her that she might
herself be of aid to Bill. The old processes of her mind still ran true to form; she had gone
to ask a man to carry out her wish.  At first she had felt wholly helpless at his refusal.
But why should she not go herself?

If indeed Bill had reached the Twenty-three Mile cabin, he would be mushing home by now; she
would meet him somewhere on his snowshoe trail. No harm would be done.  It might even be a
pleasant adventure to mush with him in the snow.  The snow itself was perfect for travel; and
she had learned that her strong young body was capable of long distances in a day.  And if
he were in trouble she could help him.

It might mean building a fire in the snow and possibly camping out through the day and night
to come.  It would be a dreadful and dangerous experience, yet she saw no reason why she couldn't
endure it.  Bill had showed her how to make the best of such a bad situation as this.  He had
taught her how to build a fire in the snow; her round, slender arms--made muscular in her weeks
in the North--could cut fuel to keep it burning.  Besides, she would carry the caribou robe--one
of the cot coverings that Bill had stored in his cabin and which, though light as down, was
practically impervious to cold.  Besides, there was no one else to go.

She went swiftly to her cabin, put on her warmest clothing, and, as Bill had showed her, rolled
a compact pack for her back.  She took a little package of food--nourishing chocolate and dried
meat--the whisky flask that had been her salvation the night of the river experience, and a
stub of candle for fire-building, tying them firmly in the caribou robe.  The entire package
weight only about ten pounds.  She fastened it on her shoulders, hung a camp ax at her belt;
and as she waited for the dawn, ate a hearty but cold breakfast.  Then, with never a backward
look, she started away, down the dim, wind-blown, snowshoe trail.

XXV

Now that the fight was done, Bill lay quite calm and peaceful in the drifts.  The pain of the
cold and the wrack of exhausted muscles were quite gone.

He was face to face with the flaming truth, and he knew his fate.  The North, defied so long,
had conquered him a last.  It had been waiting for him, lurking, watching its chance; and with
its cruel agents, the bitter cold and the unending snow, it had crushed and beaten him down.
He felt no resentment.  He was glad that the trial was over.  He knew a deep, infinite peace.

Sleep was encroaching upon him now.  He felt himself drifting, and the tide would never bring
him back.  He stirred a little, putting his hands in his armpits, his face resting on his elbow.
The wind swept by, sobbing: there in the shadow of death he caught its tones and its messages
as never before.  He was being swept into space. ...

On the trail that he had made on the out-journey, and which he had tried to vainly to follow
back, Virginia came mushing toward him.  Never before had her muscles responded so obediently
to her will; she sped at a pace that she had never traveled before.  It was as if some power
above herself was bearing her along, swiftly, easily, with never a wasted motion.  She tilted
the nose of her snowshoes just the right angle, no more or less, and all her muscles seemed
to work in perfect unison.

The bitter cold of the early morning hours only made her blood flow faster and gave her added
energy.  She scarcely felt the pack on her back.  The snowshoe trail, however, was so faint
as to be almost invisible.

Because the snow had been firm in this part of Bill's journey, his track was not so deep and
the drifting snow had almost completely filled it. In a few places the track was entirely obscured;
always there were merely dim indentations.  If she had started an hour later she could not
have followed the trail at all.  For all the day was clear, the wind still whirled flurries
of dry snow across her path.

But she didn't permit herself to despair.  If need be, she told herself, she would follow him
clear to the Twenty-three Mile cabin.  The tracks were ever more dim, but surely they would
be deeper again where Bill had encountered the soft snow.

It became increasingly probable, however, that the tracks would completely fade away before
that time.  Soon the difficulty of finding the imprints in the snow began to slacken her gait.
To lose them completely meant failure: she could not find her way in these snowy stretches
unguided.  As morning reached its full, the white wastes seemed to stretch unbroken.

Was the wind-blown snow going to defeat her purpose, after all?  A great weight of fear and
disappointment began to assail her.  The truth of the matter was she had come to an exposed
slope, and the trail had faded out under the snow dust.

At first there seemed nothing to do but turn back.  It might be possible, however, to cross
the ridge in front: the valley beyond was more sheltered by the wind and she might pick up
the trail again.  At least she could follow her own tracks back, if she failed.  She sped swiftly
on.

She had guessed right.  Standing on the ridge top she could see, far off through one of the
treeless glades that are found so often in the spruce forest, the long path of a snowshoe trail.
Instinctively she followed it with her eyes.

Clear where the trail entered the spruce thicket, her keen eyes made out a curious, black shadow
against the snow.  For a single second she eyed it calmly, wondering what manner of wild creature
it might be.  Its outline grew more distinct under her intense gaze, and she cried out. It
was only a little sound, half a gasp and half a sob, but it expressed the depths of terror
and distress never known to her before.

It seemed to her that she could not move at first.  She could only stand and gaze.  The heart
in her breast turned to ice, her blood seemed to go still in her veins.  She recognized this
figure now.  It was Bill, lying still in the frozen drifts.

For endless hours, it seemed to her, she stood impotent with horror.  In reality, the time
was not an appreciable fraction of a breath.  Then, sobbing, she mushed frantically down toward
him.  She fairly raced,--with never a misstep.  For all the ghastly sickness that swept over
her, she held her body in perfect discipline.  She had no doubt but that this man was dead.
Likely he had lain there for hours, and really only a very short time of such cold as this
was needed to take life.  Already, she thought, the life had gone from his dark, gentle eyes;
the brave heart was still; the brave heart was still; the mighty muscles lifeless clay.

No moment of her life had ever been fraught with such overwhelming bitterness as this.  She
had never known such fear, even in the grip of the wild waters or during the grizzly's charge.
This was something that went deeper than mere life: it touched realms of her spirit undreamed
of, and the blow seemed more cruel and more dreadful than any that the world could deal direct
to her.  If she had paused for one second of self-analysis, heaven knows what light might have
burst upon her spirit--what deep and wondrous realizations of her attitude toward Bill might
have come to her; but she did not pause.  She only knew that she must reach his side.  Her
only thought was that Bill was dead, gone from her life as a flame goes from an extinguished
candle.

She knelt beside him, and with no knowledge of effort turned him over and lifted his head and
shoulders into her arms.  His eyes were closed, his face expressionless, his arms dropped limply
to his side.  At first she dared not dream but that the cold had already taken away his life.
The dread Spirit of the North had lain in ambush for him a long time, but it had conquered
him at last.

They made an unearthly picture,--these two so silent in the drifts. Endless about them lay
the snow; the winter forest was deep in its eternal silence, the little spruce trees stood
patient and inert and queer, under their heavy loads of snow.  Never a voice in all the wastes,
never a tear of pity or a stretching hand of mercy,--only the cold, only the silence, only
the dread solitude of a land untamed,--the unconquerable wild.  Yet her sorrow, her ineffable
despair left no room for resentment against this dreadful land.  It was only a lost fight in
an eternal war; only a little incident in the vast and inscrutable schemes of a remorseless Nature.

She knew life now, this girl of cities.  She knew that in her past life she had never really
lived: she had only moved in a gentle dream that an artificial civilization had made possible.
The gayeties, the culture, the luxuries and the fashions that had seemed so real and so essential
before were revealed in their true light, only as dreams that would pass: deep in them she
had never heard the crash of armor in the battlefields without her bower.  But she knew now.
She saw life as it was, stark and cruel, remorseless, pitiless to the weak, treacherous to
the strong, ever waging war against all creatures that dwelt upon the earth.

Yet so easily could it have been redeemed!  If this man were standing strong beside her, life
would be nothing to fear, nothing to appall her spirit.  All the ancient persecutions of the
elements, all the pitfalls of life and the exigencies of fortune could never bow their heads.
Instead they would know high adventure and the exhilaration of battle; even if at the day's
end they should go down into death, it would be with unbroken spirits and brave hearts.

But she couldn't stand alone!  She needed the touch of his hand, his shoulder against hers,
the communion of his spirit and his strength. Life was an appalling thing to face alone!  There
was no joy now in the punishing cold and the wastes of forest; only sadness and fear and despair.
Sitting in the snow, his head and shoulders in her arms, she knew a fear and a loneliness undreamed
of before, a loss that could never be atoned for or redeemed. 

"i were to see t is the gaze could not have been instead. He might be now during me were," she.

Pete nodded.  Joe made no response.

"Then you can find it, Pete.  I haven't any idea where it is myself. It's only a day's march,
and he's got it packed with grub.  You hide out there, and the little food we have left in
the cabin'll be enough to take us down there too--the woman and I--we'll follow your snowshoes
tracks.  Then we'll make it through to the Yuga from there.  And if we have to, we can go over
to a grizzly carcass I know of and cut off a few pounds of meat--but we won't have to.  We'll
join you at the Twenty-three Mile cabin to-morrow night."

Pete the breed looked doubtful.  "Bear over--east?" he asked.

"Somewhere over there," Harold replied.

"Don't guess any bear meat left.  Heard coyotes--hundred of 'em--over east.  Pack of wolves
came through too--sang song over there."

Harold could agree with him.  If indeed the wolves and the coyotes had gathered--starving gray
skulkers of the forest--the great skeleton would have been stripped clean by now.  However,
it didn't complicate his own problem.  The Indians could get down to the Twenty-three Mile
cabin with the morsel of food they had left--he and Virginia could follow their trail with
the fragment of supplies remaining in Bill's cabin.

"You can go from there to the Yuga and hide out," Harold went on.  "I'll go down to the recorder's
office with the woman.  Don't worry about her, I'll tell 'em that you were two Indians from
the East Selkirks, give 'em a couple of false names and send 'em on a goose chase.  It's simple
as day and doesn't need any nerve.  And if you've got it through your heads, I'm going back
to the cabin."

They had it through their heads.  The plan, as Harold said, was exceedingly simple.  They digested
it slowly, then nodded.  But Pete had one more question--one that was wholly characteristic
of his weasel soul.

"What do you want us to use?" he asked.  "This?"  He indicated the thin blade at his thigh.
"Maybe use rifle?"

Harold's eyes looked drowsy when he answered.  Something like a lust, a desire swept over him;
this question of Pete's moved him in dark and evil ways.  "Oh, I don't know," he replied. 
"It doesn't much matter----"  He spoke in a strained, thick voice that was vaguely exciting
to the two breeds.  For a few seconds he seemed to stand listening, rather than in thought,
and he continued his reply as if he were scarcely aware of his own words.  It was as if a voice
from the past was speaking through his lips.  The words came with no conscious effort; rather
were they the dread outpourings of an inherent fester in his soul.  His father's blood was
in the full ascendancy at last.

"There's an old pick on the table--Bill had it prospecting." he said.

XXVIII

Bill's eyes were considerably better when he wakened--full in the daylight.  The warm wet cloths
had taken part of the inflammation out of them, and when he strained to open the lids, he was
aware of a little, dim gleam of light.  He couldn't make out objects, however, and except for
a fleeting shadow he could not discern the hand that he swept before his face.  Several days
and perhaps weeks would pass before the full strength of his sight returned.

His greatest hope at present was that he could grope his way about the cabin and build a fire
for Virginia.  Whether she wished to get up or not to-day, the growing chill in the room must
be removed.  He got up, fumbled on the floor for such of his outer garments as Virginia had
removed, and after a world of difficulty managed to get them on.  He was amazingly refreshed
by the night's sleep and Virginia's nursing.  His eyes throbbed, of course; his muscles were
lame and painful, his head ached and his arms and legs seemed to be dismembered, yet he knew
that complete recovery was only a matter of hours.

Building the fire, however, was a grievous task.  He felt it incumbent upon him to move with
utmost caution so that Virginia would not waken. By groping about the walls he encountered
the stove.  It was pleasantly warm to his hands, and when he opened the door he found that
hot coals were still glowing in the ashes.  Then he fumbled about the floor for such fuel as
Harold had provided.

He found a piece at last, and soon a cheery crackle told him that it had ignited.  He grinned
with delight at the thought that he, almost stone blind, had been able to build a fire in a
room with a sleeping girl and not waken her.  But his joy was a trifle premature.  At that
instant he tripped over a piece of firewood and his hands crashed against the logs.

"Oh, blast my clumsiness!" he whispered; then stood still as death to see what had befallen.
Virginia stirred behind her curtain.

"Is that you, Harold?" she asked.

She was wide awake, and further deception was unavailing.  "No.  It's Bill."

"Well, what are you doing, up?  Did Harold--do you mean to say you built the fire yourself?"

"That's me, lady----"

"Then you must have your sight again----"  The girl snatched aside the curtain and peered into
his face.

"No such luck.  Coals were still glowing; all I had to do was put in a piece of firewood. 
But I'm all well otherwise, as far as I can tell. How about you?"

The girl stretched up her arms.  "A little stiff--Bill, I've certainly gained recuperative
powers since I came up here.  But, Heavens, I've had bad dreams.  And now--I want you to tell
me just how this blindness of yours--is going to affect our getting out."

It was a serious question, one to which Bill had already given much thought.  "I don't see
how it can affect us a great deal," he answered at last.  "I realize you don't know one step
of the way down to Bradleyburg, and I can't see the way; but Harold knows it perfectly.  Of
course if we had plenty of food the sensible thing to do would be to wait--till I get back
my sight.  But you know--we haven't scarcely any food at all.  The last of the meat is gone,
except one little piece of jerky.  We've got a cup or two of flour and one or two cans.  Of
course there isn't enough to get down to the settlements on."

"Then we'll have to use the grizzly--after all?"

"Of course.  Thank God we had him to fall back on.  But even with him, I don't think we ought
to wait till I get back my sight.  We might have other delays, and perhaps another softening
of the crust.  It will be pretty annoying--traveling on grizzly flesh--and pretty awkward to
have a blind man in the party, but--I'll be some good, anyway.  Maybe I can cut fuel."

The girl was deeply touched.  It was so characteristic of this man that even in his blindness
he wished to make the difficulties of the journey just as light as possible for her.

"I won't let you do a thing," she told him.  "Harold and I can do the work of camp."

"There won't be much to do, unfortunately; our camping will have to be exceedingly simple.
We'll take the sled full of blankets and grizzly meat and what other little things we need.
I don't see why you can't ride on it, too--most of the way; the going is largely downhill and
the crust is perfect.  We can skim along.  At night we'll have to sleep out--and not get much
sleep, either--but by going hard, even on snowshoes, we can make it through in three days--sleeping
out just two nights. You set that when its glance there are not be encompass of sunlight tracks

  "Tell her if you want to--all about Sindy and everything
else.  Do you think I'm ashamed of it?  I've heard all I want to from you too--and I'll say
and drink what I please."

Bill had no answer at first.  He had thought that this threat might bring Harold to time; he
had supposed that the man valued Virginia's love as much as he, in a similar position, would
have valued it.  Harold turned to the girl.  "So you're not my woman, eh?"

"No, no, no!  I never will be!"  The girl's eyes were blazing, and she had forgotten her fear
in her magnificent wrath.  "I suppose--you were a squaw man.  These Indians are your own friends."

Harold smiled cruelly.  "Yes, a squaw man.  And these are my friends. Don't you suppose I've
known--for the last week--you were just fooling me along, all the time fondling Bill?  Sindy
at least was faithful--and her form wouldn't take anything from yours."

Pete, watching Joe, was somewhat amazed at the curious start the man made.  His searching gaze
had leaped over the girl's form; his dark, smoldering eyes suddenly blazed red.  There was
no other word than red. They were like two coals of fire.

There ensued a moment of strange and menacing silence.  Pete chuckled, already receptive to
Joe's thought.  Harold turned to stare at him.

Joe put his pipe to his lips, then fumbled at his pocket.  He seemed to search in vain.  "Will
you give me a match, please, lady?" he asked.

The tone was strange, thick and strained, yet Virginia's heart thrilled with hope.  The request
was a welcome interlude in a quarrel that was already rapidly approaching the fighting stage.
Perhaps if these men started to smoke, their blood would cool; she had known of old that tobacco
was a wonderful bromide to overstretched nerves.  He turned quickly to the shelf above Bill's
head and procured half a dozen matches from the box.

As her back was turned she heard Pete laugh again,--one evil syllable that filled her with
instinctive horror.  Her wide eyes turned to him; he was watching her intently.  Then she stepped
back to give Joe the matches.

Instinctively her eyes turned to the wall for a reassuring sight of her pistol.  It was gone
from its place.

For an instant she stared in horrified amazement.  The matches dropped idly from her hand.
A sob caught in her throat, a sob of hopeless and utter terror, but she fought a brave little
fight to suppress it.  She knew she must appear to be brave; at least she must do this much.
She looked at Joe; his evil, leering face told her only too plainly that his eager hand had
seized and secreted her pistol.  Pete's face was drawn too; Harold only looked bewildered.

He was her last hope, but in one instant's scrutiny she saw that this had vanished, too.  Some
terrible thought had sobered and engrossed him. Now he was eyeing her like a witless thing,
his features drawn, his eyes burning.  The moment was charged with ineffable suspense.

"What is it, Virginia?" Bill asked.

"One of these men--" she answered brokenly--"has taken my pistol.  I want him to give it back----"

The circle laughed then,--a harsh and sinister sound that filled her with inexpressible horror.
For a moment she stood motionless in the center of that leering circle, her eyes wide, her
face white as death,--a slight figure, trying to hard to stand straight, crushed and defenseless,
only her eyes pleading in last appeal.  Instinctively her lips whispered a prayer.

Joe spoke then, a single sentence in the vernacular for Harold's ears. With one gesture he
indicated Harold, himself, and Pete in turn, then pointed to the girl.  His face was hideous
with eagerness.

Harold started at the words, but at first made no answer.  He had lost her anyway; there was
no need of further restraint.  The silence, the stress, most of all the burning liquor flung
a wild and devastating flame through his veins, a dreadful madness seized his brain.  There
was no saving grace, no impulse of manhood, no memory of virtue to hold him back.

His degeneracy was complete.  He could not go lower.  His father's wicked blood pulsed in his
veins; the final brutality that the North bestows upon those it conquers was upon him.  He
answered with a curse.

"Why not?" he said.  "The slut's thrown me over.  When I'm through you can do what you want.
And crack the skull of that mole with the pick and throw him out in the snow."

The two Indians lurched forward at his words.  Bill left his chair in a mighty leap.

XXXI

When Bill sprang forward to intercept the attack upon the girl he came with amazing accuracy
and power.  There was nothing of blindness or misdirection about that leap.  It was as if his
sight had already returned to him.  The real truth was that by means of his acute ear he had
located the exact position of every actor in the impending drama.

What was more important, he knew the location of both candles.  For all his almost total blindness,
he could discern through his watering eyes the faint, yellow gleam of each.  The one that burned
beside him, on the little shelf, he brushed off with one sweep of his hand as he leaped. He
knocked the second from the table; it fell, flickered, filled the room an instant with dancing
light, and then went out.  The utter darkness dropped down.

The act had been so swift and unexpected that neither Joe, standing nearest to the girl, or
Harold across the room could draw their pistols and fire.  Seemingly in a flash the darkness
was upon them.  No more was Bill the blind and helpless mole, to strike down with one careless
blow. He was face to face with his enemies in his own dark lair.  He had turned the tables;
the advantage of vision on which they had presumed had been in an instant removed.  They could
see no more than he could now.  Besides, in the hours since his rescue, he had already learned
to find his way around the cabin.

And this was no half-darkness--that which descended as the candles were struck down.  It was
the infinite, smothering gloom of an underground cave in which no shadow could live, nor the
sharpest outline remain visible.  Harold cursed in the blackness; as if in a continuation of
the leap he had made to upset the candles, Bill seized Virginia in his strong arms.  He thrust
her to the floor and into the angle between her bunk and the wall, the point that he instinctively
realized would be easiest to defend and safest from stray bullets.  Then, widening his arms,
almost to the width of the little space between the table and the wall, he lunged forward again.

Virginia's pistol was in Joe's hand by now, and he shot in Bill's direction.  Two spurts of
yellow fire broke for an instant the utter gloom.  But there was no time for a third shot.
He was the nearest of the three attackers, and Bill's outstretched arms seized him.  The woodsman's
muscles gave a mighty wrench.

His grasp was about Joe's chest at first, but with a great lurch he slung the man's body out
far enough so that he could loop his sinewy arms about the man's knees.  Joe was shifted in
his arms as workmen are sometimes snatched up by a mighty belt in a machine shop; he seemed
simply to snap in the remorseless grasp.  Bill himself had no sensation of his enemy's weight.
He had him about the knees by now, Joe's body thrust out almost straight from centrifugal force,
and with a terrific wrench of his mighty shoulders Bill hurled him against the wall.

It was well for his enemies that none of them were in the road of that human missile.  They
would have taken no further part in the ensuing battle.  Joe's body crushed against the logs
with a sound that was strange and horrible in the utter darkness; the pistol spun from his
hand and rattled down'; then he fell with a crash to the floor.  There was no further movement
from him thereafter.  His neck had been broken like a match.  The odds were but two to one.

Harold had taken out his own revolver now and was shooting blindly in the darkness.  Ducking
low, Bill leaped for him.  In that leap there was none of the gentle mercy with which he had
dealt with him first, so long ago in Harold's cabin.  But a quick movement by Harold saved
him from the full force of the leap; in a moment they were grappling in each other's arms.

Bill wrenched him back and forth, and in an instant would have crushed the life out of him
if it hadn't been for the interference of Pete.  The latter breed leaped on his back, and Bill
had to neglect Harold an instant to stretch up his arms and hurl Pete to the floor.  Harold
still clung to him, trying to seize his throat, but Bill wrenched him down. He flung his own
body down on top of him, then seized him by the throat with the deadly intention of hammering
his head on the floor; but before he could accomplish his purpose Pete was upon him again.

It was the end of the preliminaries.  In that second the fight began in earnest.  They were
both powerful men, the breed and Harold; and Bill was like a wild beast--quick as a cougar,
resistless as a grizzly--a fighting fury that in the darkness was terrible as death.  Mighty
muscles, stinging blows, striking fists and grasping arms; the rage and glory of battle was
upon him as never before.

It was the death fight--in the darkness--and that meant it was a savage, nightmare thing that
called forth those most deep and terrible instincts that in the first days of the earth were
stored and implanted in the germ plasm.  These were no longer men of the twentieth century.
They were simply beasts, fighting to the death in a cave.  It was a familiar thing to be warring
thus in the darkness: Neither Harold nor Pete missed the light now.  They were carried back
to no less furious battles, fought in dark caverns under the sea; murder flamed in their hearts
and fire ran riot in their blood.

"As soon as it gets light enough for him to see, I want you to go out the cabin door.  Turn
at once into the brush at your right, so he can't shoot you with the rifle.  Then come around
to the side of the cabin and re-enter through the window.  You can feel your way, and I can
guide you by my voice, but you mustn't go more than a few feet or you'll get bewildered.  The
moment he thinks you are gone, he'll come--not only to get his snowshoes but to gloat over
me.  I know him now!  I can't understand why I didn't know him before.  And then--we've got
to take him by surprise."

"And then----?"

Quickly, with few words, she told him the rest of her plot.  It was wholly simple, and at least
it held a fighting chance.  He was not blind to the deadly three-day battle that they would
have to wage against starvation and cold, in case this immediate part of their plot was a success.
But the slightest chance when death was the only alternative was worth the trial.

Very carefully and softly Bill went to work to loosen the window so that he could take it out.
It was secured by nails, but with such tools as he had in the cabin, he soon had it free. 
Then he lifted out the window, putting it back loosely so that he could remove it in a second's
time.  There was no wisdom in leaving it open until morning.  The bitter cold without was waiting
for just that chance.

He secured certain thongs of rawhide--left over from the moose skin that he had used for snowshoe
webs--and put them in his coat pocket. Then he made a little bed for the girl, on the floor
and against the wall, exactly in front and opposite the doorway.  It was noticeable, too, that
he restored her pistol to her hand.

"I don't think you'll need it," he told her, "but I want you to have it anyway--in case of
an emergency."

There was nothing to do thereafter but to build up the fire and wait for dawn.

In reality, Virginia had guessed the situation just right.  In the adjoining cabin, scarcely
one hundred yards away, Harold waited and watched his chance to recover his snowshoes.  He
was wise enough to care to wait for daylight.  He wanted no further meeting with Bill in the
darkness.  But in the light he would have every advantage; he could see to shoot and his blind
foe could not return his fire.

After all, he had only to be patient.  Vengeance would be swift and sure.  When the morning
broke he would come into his own again, with never a chance for failure.  One little glance
along his rifle sights, one quarter-ounce of pressure on the trigger,--and then he could journey
down to the Yuga and his squaw in happiness and safety.  It would be a hard march, but once
there he could get supplies and return to jump Bill's claim.  Everything would turn out right
for him after all.

The fact that his confederates were slain mattered not one way or another.  Pete had gone out
with a bullet through his lungs; Virginia had dealt him that.  Joe's neck had been broken when
Bill had hurled him against the cabin wall.  But in a way, these things were an advantage.
There was sufficient food in the cabin for one meal for the three of them, and that meant it
was three meals for one.  A day's rations, carefully spent, would carry him the two day's march
to the Yuga. Besides, the breeds would not be present to claim their third of the mine.  He
wondered why he hadn't handled the whole matter himself, in the first place.  He would have
been fully capable, he thought.  As to Virginia,--he hadn't decided about Virginia yet.  He
didn't know of her wound, or his security would have seemed all the more complete. Virginia
might yet listen to reason and accompany him down to the Yuga. He had only to wait till dawn.

But Harold's thought was not entirely clear.  The fury in his brain and the madness in his
blood distorted it,--just a little.  Otherwise he might have conceived of some error in his
plans.  He would have been a little more careful, a little less sure.  His insane and devastating
longing for vengeance, as well as his late drunkenness, cost him the fine but essential edge
of his self-mastery.

Slowly the stars faded, the first ghostly light came stealing from the east.  The blood began
to leap once more in his veins.  Already it was almost light enough to shoot.  Then his straining
eyes saw Bill emerge from the cabin.

Every nerve in his body seemed to jerk and thrill with renewed excitement.  Yet there wasn't
a chance to shoot.  The light was dim; the shadows of the spruce trees hid the woodsman's figure
swiftly.  He was gone; the cabin was left unoccupied except for Virginia.  And for all that
she had shot so straight to save Bill's life, there was nothing to fear from her.  Her fury
was passed by now; he thought he knew her well enough to know that she wouldn't shoot him in
cold blood.  And perhaps some of her love for him yet lingered.

He did not try to guess the mission on which Bill had gone.  If his thought had been more clear
and his fury less, he would have paused and wondered about it; perhaps he would have been somewhat
suspicious.  Bill was blind; except to procure fuel there was no conceivable reason for an
excursion into the snow.  But Harold only shivered with hatred and rage, drunk with the realization
that his chance had come.

He would go quickly to the cabin, procure his snowshoes, and be ready to meet Bill with loaded
rifle when he returned.  There was no chance for failure.  He plunged and fought his way, floundering
in the deep snow, toward Bill's cabin.

He found to his great delight that the door was open,--nothing to do but walk through.  At
first he was a little amazed at the sight of Virginia lying so still against the opposite wall;
it occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she had been wounded in the fight.  If so,
it made his work all the safer.  Yet she opened her eyes and gazed at him as he neared the
threshold.  He could see her but dimly; mostly the cabin was still dusky with shadows.

"I'm coming for my snowshoes, Virginia," he told her.  "Then I'm going to go away."  He tried
to draw his battered, bloody lips into a smile.

"Come in and get them," she replied.  Her voice was low and lifeless. Harold stepped through
the door.  And then she uttered a curious cry.

"Now!" she called sharply.  There was no time for Harold to dart back, even to be alarmed.
A mighty force descended upon his body.

Even in that first instant Harold knew only too well what had occurred. Instead of lying in
wait himself he had been lured into ambush.  Bill had re-entered the window and had stood waiting
in the shadow, just beside the open door.  Virginia had given him the signal when to leap down.

He leaped with crushing force,--as the grizzly leaps, or the cougar pounces from a tree.  There
was nothing of human limitations about that attack.  Harold tried to struggle, but his attempt
was futile as that of a sparrow in the jaws of the little ermine.  Only too well he knew the
strength of these pitiless arms that clasped him now.  He had learned it the night before,
and his lust for vengeance gave way to ghastly and blood-curdling terror.  What would these
two avengers do to him; what justice would they wreak on him, now that they had him in their
power? The resistless shoulders hurled him to the floor.  Virginia left her bed and came creeping
to be of such aid as was needed.

She wholly disregarded her own injury.  Her own countrymen, in wars agone, had fought all day
with wounds much worse.  She crept with her pistol ready in her hands.

Bill's strong fingers were at Harold's throat by now; the man's resistance was swiftly crushed
out of him.  With his knee Bill held down one of Harold's arms; with his free arm he struck
blow after blow into his face. Idea from him could be, and after underlings who had a share,

I'd give ten voices out my life show you have the Ideas.  Were they to know the hardship of the journey, starvation and bitter
cold, only to find death in some still, enchanted glen of the forest that stretched in front?
Was fate still jesting with them, whispering hope only to shatter them with defeat?  Were they
to know hunger and exhaustion, pain and travail, until finally their bodies dropped down and
yielded to the cold?  They could not keep up long without the inner fuel of food.

Their chance of finding game seemed hopelessly small, even at first. Before they reached the
frozen river it seemed beyond the possibilities of miracle.  Even the tracks of the little
people--such ferocious hunters as marten and ermine--were gone from the snow. My morning, because

The bundle was full of food,--dried meat and canned goods and a small sack of flour.  They

upon the old mining camp.  The twilight was growing in the glen beneath; already it had cast
shadows in Virginia's eyes.  She sat beside him on the sled.

It had been cruel hardship, the three days' journey, but they had made it without mishap. 
At night they had built great fires at the mouth of their tent, but they had not escaped the

"They're beautiful now."

And they were.  She told the truth.  For all their savagery, their fearful strength, their
