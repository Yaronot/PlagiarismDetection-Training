Vanishing Roads And Other Essays

 TO

 ROBERT HOBART DAVIS

DEAR BOB: It is quite a long time now since you and I first caught sight of each other and
became fellow wayfarers on this Vanishing Road of the world. O quite a lot of years now, Bob!
Yet I control my tendency to shiver at their number from the fact that we have travelled them,
always within hailing distance of each other, I with the comfortable knowledge that near by
I had so good a comrade, so true a friend.

For this once, by your leave, we won't "can" the sentiment,--to use an idiom in which you are
the master-artist on this continent,--but I, at least, will luxuriate in retrospect, as I write
your name by way of dedication to this volume of essays, for some of which your quick-firing
mind is somewhat more than editorially responsible. You were one of the first to make me welcome
to a country of which, even as a boy, I used prophetically to dream as my "promised land,"
little knowing that it was indeed to be my home, the home of my spirit, as well as the final
resting-place of my household gods; and, having you so early for my friend, is it to be wondered
at if I soon came to regard the American humourist as the noblest work of God?

There is yet, I trust, much left of the Vanishing Road for us to travel together; and I hope
that, when the time comes for us both to vanish over the horizon line, we may exit still within
hail of each other,--so that we may have a reasonable chance of hitting the trail together
on the next route, whatever it is going to be.

Always yours,
    RICHARD LE GALLIENNE.

VANISHING ROADS

Though actually the work of man's hands--or, more properly speaking, the work of his travelling
feet,--roads have long since come to seem so much a part of Nature that we have grown to think
of them as a feature of the landscape no less natural than rocks and trees. Nature has adopted
them among her own works, and the road that mounts the hill to meet the sky-line, or winds
away into mystery through the woodland, seems to be veritably her own highway leading us to
the stars, luring us to her secret places. And just as her rocks and trees, we know not how
or why, have come to have for us a strange spiritual suggestiveness, so the vanishing road
has gained a meaning for us beyond its use as the avenue of mortal wayfaring, the link of communication
between village and village and city and city; and some roads indeed seem so lonely, and so
beautiful in their loneliness, that one feels they were meant to be travelled only by the soul.
All roads indeed lead to Rome, but theirs also is a more mystical destination, some bourne
of which no traveller knows the name, some city, they all seem to hint, even more eternal.

Never more than when we tread some far-spreading solitude and mark the road stretching on and
on into infinite space, or the eye loses it in some wistful curve behind the fateful foliage
of lofty storm-stirred trees, or as it merely loiters in sunny indolence through leafy copses
and ferny hollows, whatever its mood or its whim, by moonlight or at morning; never more than
thus, eagerly afoot or idly contemplative, are we impressed by that something that Nature seems
to have to tell us, that something of solemn, lovely import behind her visible face. If we
could follow that vanishing road to its far mysterious end! Should we find that meaning there?
Should we know why it stops at no mere market-town, nor comes to an end at any seaport? Should
we come at last to the radiant door, and know at last the purpose of all our travel? Meanwhile
the road beckons us on and on, and we walk we know not why or whither.

Vanishing roads do actually stir such thoughts, not merely by way of similitude, but just in
the same way that everything in Nature similarly stirs thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls;
as moonlit waters stir them, or the rising of the sun. As I have said, they have come to seem
a part of natural phenomena, and, as such, may prove as suggestive a starting-point as any
other for those speculations which Nature is all the time provoking in us as to why she affects
us thus and thus. These mighty hills of multitudinous rock, piled confusedly against the sky--so
much granite and iron and copper and crystal, says one. But to the soul, strangely something
besides, so much more. These rolling shapes of cloud, so fantastically massed and moulded,
moving in rhythmic change like painted music in the heaven, radiant with ineffable glories
or monstrous with inconceivable doom. This sea of silver, "hushed and halcyon," or this sea
of wrath and ravin, wild as Judgment Day. So much vapour and sunshine and wind and water, says one.

Yet to the soul how much more!

And why? Answer me that if you can. There, truly, we set our feet on the vanishing road.

Whatever reality, much or little, the personifications of Greek Nature-worship had for the
ancient world, there is no doubt that for a certain modern temperament, more frequently met
with every day, those personifications are becoming increasingly significant, and one might
almost say veritably alive. Forgotten poets may, in the first instance, have been responsible
for the particular forms they took, their names and stories, yet even so they but clothed with
legend presences of wood and water, of earth and sea and sky, which man dimly felt to have
a real existence; and these presences, forgotten or banished for a while in prosaic periods,
or under Puritanic repression, are once more being felt as spiritual realities by a world coming
more and more to evoke its divinities by individual meditation on, and responsiveness to, the
mysterious so-called natural influences by which it feels itself surrounded. Thus the first
religion of the world seems likely to be its last. In other words, the modern tendency, with
spiritually sensitive folk, is for us to go direct to the fountain-head of all theologies,
Nature herself, and, prostrating ourselves before her mystery, strive to interpret it according
to our individual "intimations," listening, attent, for ourselves to her oracles, and making,
to use the phrase of one of the profoundest of modern Nature-seers, our own "reading of earth."
Such was Wordsworth's initiative, and, as some one has said, "we are all Wordsworthians today."
That pagan creed, in which Wordsworth passionately wished himself suckled, is not "outworn."

Nor have the dryads and the fauns been frighted away for good. All over the world they are
trooping back to the woods, and whoso has eyes may catch sight, any summer day, of "the breast
of the nymph in the brake." Imagery, of course; but imagery that is coming to have a profounder
meaning, and a still greater expressive value, than it ever had for Greece and Rome. All myths
that are something more than fancies gain rather than lose in value with time, by reason of
the accretions of human experience. The mysteries of Eleusis would mean more for a modern man
than for an ancient Greek, and in our modern groves of Dodona the voice of the god has meanings
for us stranger than ever reached his ears. Maybe the meanings have a purport less definite,
but they have at least the suggestiveness of a nobler mystery. But surely the Greeks were right,
and we do but follow them as we listen to the murmur of the wind in the lofty oaks, convinced
as they of the near presence of the divine.

Nor was it a vain thing to watch the flight of birds across the sky, and augur this or that
of their strange ways. We too still watch them in a like mood, and, though we do not interpret
them with a like exactitude, we are very sure that they mean something important to our souls,
as they speed along their vanishing roads.

This modern feeling of ours is quite different from the outworn "pathetic fallacy," which was
a purely sentimental attitude. We have, of course, long since ceased to think of Nature as
the sympathetic mirror of our moods, or to imagine that she has any concern with the temporal
affairs of man. We no longer seek to appease her in her terrible moods with prayer and sacrifice.
We know that she is not thinking of us, but we do know that for all her moods there is in us
an answering thrill of correspondence, which is not merely fanciful or imaginative, but of
the very essence of our beings. It is not that we are reading our thoughts into her. Rather
we feel that we are receiving her thoughts into ourselves, and that, in certain receptive hours,
we are, by some avenue simpler and profounder than reason, made aware of certitudes we cannot
formulate, but which nevertheless siderealize into a faith beyond the reach of common doubt--a
faith, indeed, unelaborate, a faith, one might say, of one tenet: belief in the spiritual sublimity
of all Nature, and, therefore, of our own being as a part thereof.

In such hours we feel too, with a singular lucidity of conviction, that those forces which
thus give us that mystical assurance are all the time moulding us accordingly as we give up
ourselves to their influence, and that we are literally and not fancifully what winds and waters
make us; that the poetry, for instance, of Wordsworth was literally first somewhere in the
universe, and thence transmitted to him by processes no less natural than those which produced
his bodily frame, gave him form and feature, and coloured his eyes and hair.

It is not man that has "poetized" the world, it is the world that has made a poet out of man,
by infinite processes of evolution, precisely in the same way that it has shaped a rose and
filled it with perfume, or shaped a nightingale and filled it with song. One has often heard
it said that man has endowed Nature with his own feelings, that the pathos or grandeur of the
evening sky, for instance, are the illusions of his humanizing fancy, and have no real existence.
The exact contrary is probably the truth--that man has no feelings of his own that were not
Nature's first, and that all that stirs in him at such spectacles is but a translation into
his own being of cosmic emotions which he shares in varying degrees with all created things.
Into man's strange heart Nature has distilled her essences, as elsewhere she has distilled
them in colour and perfume. He is, so to say, one of the nerve-centres of cosmic experience.
In the process of the suns he has become a veritable microcosm of the universe. It was not
man that placed that tenderness in the evening sky. It has been the evening skies of millions
of years that have at length placed tenderness in the heart of man. It has passed into him
as that "beauty born of murmuring sound" passed into the face of Wordsworth's maiden.

Perhaps we too seldom reflect how much the life of Nature is one with the life of man, how
unimportant or indeed merely seeming, the difference between them. Who can set a seed in the
ground, and watch it put up a green shoot, and blossom and fructify and wither and pass, without
reflecting, not as imagery but as fact, that he has come into existence, run his course, and
is going out of existence again, by precisely the same process? With so serious a correspondence
between their vital experience, the fact of one being a tree and the other a man seems of comparatively
small importance. The life process has but used different material for its expression. And
as man and Nature are so like in such primal conditions, is it not to be supposed that they
are alike too in other and subtler ways, and that, at all events, as it thus clearly appears
that man is as much a natural growth as an apple-tree, alike dependent on sun and rain, may
not, or rather must not, the thoughts that come to him strangely out of earth and sky, the
sap-like stirrings of his spirit, the sudden inner music that streams through him before the
beauty of the world, be no less authentically the working of Nature within him than his more
obviously physical processes, and, say, a belief in God be as inevitable a blossom of the human
tree as apple-blossom of the apple?

If this oracular office of Nature be indeed a truth, our contemplation of her beauty and marvel
is seen to be a method of illumination, and her varied spectacle actually a sacred book in
picture-writing, a revelation through the eye of the soul of the stupendous purport of the
universe. The sun and the moon are the torches by which we study its splendid pages, turning
diurnally for our perusal, and in star and flower alike dwells the lore which we cannot formulate
into thought, but can only come indescribably to know by loving the pictures. "The meaning
of all things that are" is there, if we can only find it. It flames in the sunset, or flits
by us in the twilight moth, thunders or moans or whispers in the sea, unveils its bosom in
the moonrise, affirms itself in mountain-range and rooted oak, sings to itself in solitary
places, dreams in still waters, nods and beckons amid sunny foliage, and laughs its great green
laugh in the wide sincerity of the grass.

As the pictures in this strange and lovely book are infinite, so endlessly varied are the ways
in which they impress us. In our highest moments they seem to be definitely, almost consciously,
sacerdotal, as though the symbolic acts of a solemn cosmic ritual, in which the universe is
revealed visibly at worship. Were man to make a practice of rising at dawn and contemplating
in silence and alone the rising of the sun, he would need no other religion. The rest of the
day would be hallowed for him by that morning memory and his actions would partake of the largeness
and chastity of that lustral hour. Moonlight, again, seems to be the very holiness of Nature,
welling out ecstatically from fountains of ineffable purity and blessedness. Of some moonlight
nights we feel that if we did what our spirits prompt us, we should pass them on our knees,
as in some chapel of the Grail. To attempt to realize in thought the rapture and purification
of such a vigil is to wonder that we so seldom pay heed to such inner promptings. So much we
lose of the best kind of joy by spiritual inertia, or plain physical sloth; and some day it
will be too late to get up and see the sunrise, or to follow the white feet of the moon as
she treads her vanishing road of silver across the sea. This involuntary conscience that reproaches
us with such laxity in our Nature-worship witnesses how instinctive that worship is, and how
much we unconsciously depend on Nature for our impulses and our moods.

Another definitely religious operation of Nature within us is expressed in that immense gratitude
which throws open the gates of the spirit as we contemplate some example of her loveliness
or grandeur. Who that has stood by some still lake and watched a stretch of water-lilies opening
in the dawn but has sent out somewhere into space a profound thankfulness to "whatever gods
there be" that he has been allowed to gaze on so fair a sight. Whatever the struggle or sorrow
of our lives, we feel in such moments our great good fortune at having been born into a world
that contains such marvels. It is sufficient success in life, whatever our minor failures,
to have beheld such beauty; and mankind at large witnesses to this feeling by the value it
everywhere attaches to scenes in Nature exceptionally noble or exquisite. Though the American
traveller does not so express it, his sentiment toward such natural spectacles as the Grand
Cañon or Niagara Falls is that of an intense reverence. Such places are veritable holy places,
and man's heart instinctively acknowledges them as sacred. His repugnance to any violation
of them by materialistic interests is precisely the same feeling as the horror with which Christendom
regarded the Turkish violation of the Holy Sepulchre. And this feeling will increase rather
than decrease in proportion as religion is recognized as having its shrines and oracles not
only in Jerusalem, or in St. Peter's, but wherever Nature has erected her altars on the hills
or wafted her incense through the woodlands.

After all, are not all religions but the theological symbolization of natural phenomena; and
the sacraments, the festivals, and fasts of all the churches have their counterparts in the
mysterious processes and manifestations of Nature? and is the contemplation of the resurrection
of Adonis or Thammuz more edifying to the soul than to meditate the strange return of the spring
which their legends but ecclesiastically celebrate?

Apart from this generally religious influence of Nature, she seems at times in certain of her
aspects and moods specifically to illustrate or externalize states of the human soul. Sometimes
in still, moonlit nights, standing, as it were, on the brink of the universe, we seem to be
like one standing on the edge of a pool, who, gazing in, sees his own soul gazing back at him.
Tiny creatures though we be, the whole solemn and majestic spectacle seems to be an extension
of our own reverie, and we to enfold it all in some strange way within our own infinitesimal
consciousness. So a self-conscious dewdrop might feel that it enfolded the morning sky, and
such probably is the meaning of the Buddhist seer when he declares that "the universe grows I."

Such are some of the more august impressions made upon us by the pictures in the cosmic picture-book;
but there are also times and places when Nature seems to wear a look less mystic than dramatic
in its suggestiveness, as though she were a stage-setting for some portentous human happening
past or to come--the fall of kings or the tragic clash of empires. As Whitman says, "Here a
great personal deed has room." Some landscapes seem to prophesy, some to commemorate. In some
places not marked by monuments, or otherwise definitely connected with history, we have a curious
haunted sense of prodigious far-off events once enacted in this quiet grassy solitude--prehistoric
battles or terrible sacrifices. About others hangs a fateful atmosphere of impending disaster,
as though weighted with a gathering doom. Sometimes we seem conscious of sinister presences,
as though veritably in the abode of evil spirits. The place seems somehow not quite friendly
to humanity, not quite good to linger in, lest its genius should cast its perilous shadow over
the heart. On the other hand, some places breathe an ineffable sense of blessedness, of unearthly
promise. We feel as though some hushed and happy secret were about to be whispered to us out
of the air, some wonderful piece of good fortune on the edge of happening. Some hand seems
to beckon us, some voice to call, to mysterious paradises of inconceivable green freshness
and supernaturally beautiful flowers, fairy fastnesses of fragrance and hidden castles of the
dew. In such hours the Well at the World's End seems no mere poet's dream. It awaits us yonder
in the forest glade, amid the brooding solitudes of silent fern, and the gate of the Earthly
Paradise is surely there in yonder vale hidden among the violet hills.

Various as are these impressions, it is strange and worth thinking on that the dominant suggestion
of Nature through all her changes, whether her mood be stormy or sunny, melancholy or jubilant,
is one of presage and promise. She seems to be ever holding out to us an immortal invitation
to follow and endure, to endure and to enjoy. She seems to say that what she brings us is but
an earnest of what she holds for us out there along the vanishing road. There is nothing, indeed,
she will not promise us, and no promise, we feel, she cannot keep. Even in her tragic and bodeful
seasons, in her elegiac autumns and stern winters, there is an energy of sorrow and sacrifice
that elevates and inspires, and in the darkest hours hints at immortal mornings. She may terrify,
but she never deadens, the soul. In earthquake and eclipse she seems to be less busy with destruction
than with renewed creation. She is but wrecking the old, that

                               ... there shall be
          Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
          Of the sky-children.

As I have thus mused along with the reader, a reader I hope not too imaginary, the manner in
which the phrase with which I began has recurred to my pen has been no mere accident, nor yet
has it been a mere literary device. It seemed to wait for one at every turn of one's theme,
inevitably presenting itself. For wherever in Nature we set our foot, she seems to be endlessly
the centre of vanishing roads, radiating in every direction into space and time. Nature is
forever arriving and forever departing, forever approaching, forever vanishing; but in her
vanishings there seems to be ever the waving of a hand, in all her partings a promise of meetings
farther along the road. She would seem to say not so much Ave atque vale, as Vale atque ave.
In all this rhythmic drift of things, this perpetual flux of atoms flowing on and on into Infinity,
we feel less the sense of loss than of a musical progression of which we too are notes.

We are all treading the vanishing road of a song in the air, the vanishing road of the spring
flowers and the winter snows, the vanishing roads of the winds and the streams, the vanishing
road of beloved faces. But in this great company of vanishing things there is a reassuring
comradeship. We feel that we are units in a vast ever-moving army, the vanguard of which is
in Eternity. The road still stretches ahead of us. For a little while yet we shall experience
all the zest and bustle of marching feet. The swift-running seasons, like couriers bound for
the front, shall still find us on the road, and shower on us in passing their blossoms and
their snows. For a while the murmur of the running stream of Time shall be our fellow-wayfarer--till,
at last, up there against the sky-line, we too turn and wave our hands, and know for ourselves
where the road wends as it goes to meet the stars. And others will stand as we today and watch
us reach the top of the ridge and disappear, and wonder how it seemed to us to turn that radiant
corner and vanish with the rest along the vanishing road.

II

WOMAN AS A SUPERNATURAL BEING

The boy's first hushed enchantment, blent with a sort of religious awe, as in his earliest
love affair he awakens to the delicious mystery we call woman, a being half fairy and half
flower, made out of moonlight and water lilies, of elfin music and thrilling fragrance, of
divine whiteness and softness and rustle as of dewy rose gardens, a being of unearthly eyes
and terribly sweet marvel of hair; such, too, through life, and through the ages, however confused
or overlaid by use and wont, is man's perpetual attitude of astonishment before the apparition
woman.

Though she may work at his side, the comrade of his sublunary occupations, he never, deep down,
thinks of her as quite real. Though his wife, she remains an apparition, a being of another
element, an Undine. She is never quite credible, never quite loses that first nimbus of the
supernatural.

This is true not merely for poets; it is true for all men, though, of course, all men may not
be conscious of its truth, or realize the truth in just this way. Poets, being endowed with
exceptional sensitiveness of feeling and expression, say the wonderful thing in the wonderful
way, bring to it words more nearly adequate than others can bring; but it is an error to suppose
that any beauty of expression can exaggerate, can indeed more than suggest, the beauty of its
truth. Woman is all that poets have said of her, and all that poets can never say:

          Always incredible hath seemed the rose,
          And inconceivable the nightingale--

and the poet's adoration of her is but the articulate voice of man's love since the beginning,
a love which is as mysterious as she herself is a mystery.

However some may try to analyse man's love for woman, to explain it, or explain it away, belittle
it, nay, even resent and befoul it, it remains an unaccountable phenomenon, a "mystery we make
darker with a name." Biology, cynically pointing at certain of its processes, makes the miracle
rather more miraculous than otherwise. Musical instruments are no explanation of music. "Is
it not strange that sheep's guts should hale souls out of men's bodies?" says Benedick, in
Much Ado About Nothing, commenting on Balthazar's music. But they do, for all that, though
no one considers sheep's gut the explanation. To cry "sex" and to talk of nature's mad preoccupation
with the species throws no light on the matter, and robs it of no whit of its magic. The rainbow
remains a rainbow, for all the sciences. And woman, with or without the suffrage, stenographer
or princess, is of the rainbow. She is beauty made flesh and dwelling amongst us, and whatever
the meaning and message of beauty may be, such is the meaning of woman on the earth--her meaning,
at all events, for men. That is, she is the embodiment, more than any other creature, of that
divine something, whatever it may be, behind matter, that spiritual element out of which all
proceeds, and which mysteriously gives its solemn, lovely and tragic significance to our mortal
day.

If you tell some women this of themselves, they will smile at you. Men are such children. They
are so simple. Dear innocents, how easily they are fooled! A little make-up, a touch of rouge,
a dash of henna--and you are an angel. Some women seem really to think this; for, naturally,
they know nothing of their own mystery, and imagine that it resides in a few feminine tricks,
the superficial cleverness with which some of them know how to make the most of the strange
something about them which they understand even less than men understand it.

Other women indeed resent man's religious attitude toward them as sentimental, old-fashioned.
They prefer to be regarded merely as fellow-men. To show consciousness of their sex is to risk
offence, and to busy one's eyes with their magnificent hair, instead of the magnificent brains
beneath it, is to insult them. Yet when, in that old court of law, Phryne bared her bosom as
her complete case for the defence, she proved herself a greater lawyer than will ever be made
by law examinations and bachelor's degrees; and even when women become judges of the Supreme
Court, a development easily within sight, they will still retain the greater importance of
being merely women. Yes, and one can easily imagine some future woman President of the United
States, for all the acknowledged brilliancy of her administration, being esteemed even more
for her superb figure.

It is no use. Woman, if she would, "cannot shake off the god." She must make up her mind, whatever
other distinctions she may achieve, to her inalienable distinction of being woman; nothing
she can do will change man's eternal attitude toward her, as a being made to be worshipped
and to be loved, a being of beauty and mystery, as strange and as lovely as the moon, the goddess
and the mother of lunatics. What a wonderful destiny is hers! In addition to being the first
of human beings, all that a man can be, to be so much else as well; to be, so to say, the president
of a railroad and yet a priestess of nature's mysteries; a stenographer at so many dollars
a week and yet a nymph of the forest pools--woman, "and yet a spirit still." Not without meaning
has myth endowed woman with the power of metamorphosis, to change at will like the maidens
in the legend into wild white swans, or like Syrinx, fleeing from the too ardent pursuit of
Pan, into a flowering reed, or like Lamia, into a jewelled serpent--

          Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;
          And full of silver moons.

Modern conditions are still more favourable than antique story for the exhibition of this protean
quality of woman, providing her with opportunities of still more startling contrasts of transformation.
Will it not be a wonderful sight in that near future to watch that woman judge of the Supreme
Court, in the midst of some learned tangle of inter-state argument, turn aside for a moment,
in response to a plaintive cry, and, unfastening her bodice, give the little clamourer the
silver solace it demands! What a hush will fall upon the assembled court! To think of such
a genius for jurisprudence, such a legal brain, working in harmony--with such a bosom! So august
a pillar of the law, yet so divine a mother.

As it is, how piquant the contrast between woman inside and outside her office hours! As you
take her out to dinner, and watch her there seated before you, a perfumed radiance, a dewy
dazzling vision, an evening star swathed in gauzy convolutions of silk and lace--can it be
the same creature who an hour or two ago sat primly with notebook and pencil at your desk side,
and took down your specification for fireproofing that new steel-constructed building on Broadway?
You, except for your evening clothes, are not changed; but she--well, your clients couldn't
possibly recognize her. As with Browning's lover, you are on the other side of the moon, "side
unseen" of office boy or of subway throng; you are in the presence of those "silent silver
lights and darks undreamed of" by the gross members of your board of directors. By day--but
ah! at evening under the electric lights, to the delicate strains of the palm-shaded orchestra!
Man is incapable of these exquisite transformations. By day a gruff and hurried machine--at
evening, at best, a rapt and laconic poker player. A change with no suggestion of the miraculous.

Do not let us for a moment imagine that because man is ceasing to remove his hat at her entrance
into crowded elevators, or because he hustles her or allows her to hang by the straps in crowded
cars, that he is tending to forget this supernaturalism of woman. Such change in his manners
merely means his respect for her disguise, her disguise as a business woman. By day she desires
to be regarded as just that, and she resents as untimely the recognition of her sex, her mystery,
and her marvel during business hours. Man's apparent impoliteness, therefore, is actually a
delicate modern form of chivalry. But of course his real feelings are only respectfully masked,
and, let her be in any danger or real discomfort, or let any language be uttered unseemly for
her ears, and we know what promptly happens. Barring such accidents, man tacitly understands
that her incognito is to be respected--till the charming moment comes when she chooses to put
it aside and take at his hands her immemorial tribute.

So, you see, she is able to go about the rough ways, taking part even in the rough work of
the world, literally bearing what the fairy tales call a charmed life. And this, of course,
gives her no small advantage in the human conflict. So protected, she is enabled, when need
arises, to take the offensive, with a minimum of danger. Consider her recent campaign for suffrage,
for example. Does any one suppose that, had she been anything but woman, a sacrosanct being,
immune from clubs and bullets, that she would have been allowed to carry matters with such
high victorious hand as in England--and more power to her!--she has of late been doing. Let
men attempt such tactics, and their shrift is uncomplimentarily short. It may be said that
woman enjoys this immunity with children and curates, but, even so, it may be held that these
latter participate in a less degree in that divine nature with which woman is so completely
armoured.

          How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
          Whose action is no stronger than a flower?

exclaims Shakespeare.

But there is indeed the mystery, for, though its "action is no stronger than a flower," the
power wielded by beauty in this world, and therefore by woman as its most dynamic embodiment,
is as undeniable as it is irresistible. "Terrible as an army with banners" was no mere figure
of lovesick speech. It is as plain a truth as the properties of radium, and belongs to the
same order of marvel. Such scientific discoveries are particularly welcome as demonstrating
the power of the finer, as contrasted with the more brutally obvious, manifestations of force;
for they thus illustrate the probable nature of those spiritual forces whose operations we
can plainly see, without being able to account for them. A foolish phrase has it that "a woman's
strength is in her helplessness." "Helplessness" is a curious term to use for a mysteriously
concentrated or super-refined form of strength. "Whose action is no stronger than a flower."
But is the action of a flower any less strong because it is not the action of a fist? As a
motive force a flower may be, and indeed has time and again been, stronger than a thousand
fists. And what then shall we say of the action of that flower of flowers that is woman--that
flower that not only once or twice in history has

          ... launched a thousand ships
          And burned the topless towers of Ilium.

Woman's helplessness, forsooth! On the contrary, woman is the best equipped fighting machine
that ever went to battle. And she is this, not from any sufferance on the part of man, not
from any consideration on his part toward her "weakness," but merely because he cannot help
himself, because nature has so made her.

No simple reasoning will account for her influence over man. It is not an influence he allows.
It is an influence he cannot resist, and it is an influence which he cannot explain, though
he may make believe to do so. That "protection," for example, which he extends to her from
the common physical perils with which he is more muscularly constituted to cope--why is it
extended? Merely out of pity to a weaker being than himself? Does other weakness always command
his pity? We know that it does not. No, this "protection" is but a part of an instinctive reverence,
for which he can give no reason, the same kind of reverence which he has always given to divine
beings, to any manifestation or vessel of the mysteriously sacred something in human life.
He respects and protects woman from the same instinct which makes him shrink from profaning
an altar or robbing a church, or sends him on his knees before any apparition supposedly divine.
Priests and women are often classed together, but not because the priests are regarded as effeminately
"helpless"; rather because both are recognized as ministers of sacred mysteries, both belong
to the spiritual sphere, and have commerce with the occult holiness of things. Also be it remarked
that this "protection" is chiefly needed against the brutality and bestiality of man's own
heart, which woman and religion alike rather hold in subjection by their mysterious influence
than have to thank for any favours of self-control. Man "protects" woman because he first worships
her, because, if she has for him not always the beauty of holiness, she at least always suggests
the holiness of beauty.

Now when has man ever suggested holiness to the most adoring woman? I do not refer to the professional
holiness of saints and ecclesiastics, but to that sense of hallowed strangeness, of mystic
purity, of spiritual exquisiteness, which breathes from a beautiful woman and makes the touch
of her hand a religious ecstasy, and her very garments a thrilling mystery. How impossible
it is to imagine a woman writing the Vita Nuova, or a girl feeling toward a boy such feelings
of awe and worship as set the boy Dante a-tremble at his first sight of the girl Beatrice.

    At that moment [he writes], I say most truly that the spirit of
    life, which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart,
    began to tremble so violently that the least pulse of my body shook
    therewith; and in trembling it said these words: "Ecce deus fortior
    me, qui veniens dominabitur mihi. (Here is a deity stronger than I,
    who, coming, shall rule over me.)" Ah! that "little frock," that sacred little frock we first
saw her in! Don't we all know it? And the little handkerchief, scented
like the breath of heaven, we begged as a sacred relic! And--

          Long after you are dead
          I will kiss the shoes of your feet....

Yes! anything she has worn or touched; for, as a modern writer has said:

    Everything a woman wears or touches immediately incarnates something
    of herself. A handkerchief, a glove, a flower--with a breath she
    endows them with immortal souls.

Waller with his girdle, Donne with "that subtle wreath of hair about his arm," the mediaeval
knight riding at tourney with his lady's sleeve at his helm, and all relic-worshipping lovers
through the ages bear witness to that divine supernaturalism of woman. To touch the hem of
that little frock, to kiss the mere imprint of those little feet, is to be purified and exalted.
But when did man affect woman in that way? I am tolerably well read in the poetry of woman's
emotions, but I recall no parallel expressions of feeling. No passionate apostrophes of his
golf stockings come to my mind, nor wistful recollections of the trousers he wore on that never-to-be-forgotten
afternoon. The immaculate collar that spanned his muscular throat finds no Waller to sing it:

          A narrow compass--and yet there
          Dwelt all that's good, and all that's fair,

and probably the smartest negligée shirt that ever sported with the summer winds on a clothes-line
has never caused the smallest flutter in feminine bosoms. The very suggestion is, of course,
absurd--whereas with women, in very deed, it is as with the temple in Keats's lines:

              ... even as the trees
          That whisper round a temple become soon
          Dear as the temple's self.

Properly understood, therefore, the cult of the skirt-dancer has a religious significance,
and man's preoccupation with petticoats is but the popular recognition of the divinity of woman.
All that she is and does and wears has a ritualistic character, and she herself commands our
reverence because we feel her to be the vessel of sacred mysteries, the earthly representative
of unearthly powers, with which she enjoys an intimacy of communication denied to man. It is
not a reasonable feeling, or one to be reasoned about; and that is why we very properly exempt
woman from the necessity of being reasonable. She is not, we say, a reasonable being, and in
so saying we pay her a profound compliment. For she transcends reason, and on that very account
is mysteriously wise, the wisest of created things--mother-wise. When we say "mother-wit,"
we mean something deeper than we realize--for what in the universe is wiser than a mother,
fed as she is through the strange channels of her being with that lore of the infinite which
seems to enter her body by means of organs subtler than the brain?

A certain famous novelist meant well when recently he celebrated woman as "the mother of the
male," but such celebration, while ludicrously masculine in its egotistic limitation, would
have fallen short even if he had stopped to mention that she was the mother of the female,
too; for not merely in the fact that she is the mother of the race resides the essential mystery
of her motherhood. We do not value woman merely, if one may be permitted the expression, as
a brood mare, an economic factor controlling the census returns. Her gift of motherhood is
stranger than that, and includes spiritual affinities and significances not entirely represented
by visible babes. Her motherhood is mysterious because it seems to be one with the universal
motherhood of nature, one with the motherhood that guards and warms to life the eggs in the
nest and the seeds in the hollows of the hills, the motherhood of the whole strange vital process,
wherever and howsoever it moves and dreams and breaks into song and flower. And, as nature
is something more than a mother, so is woman. She is a vision, an outward and visible sign
of an inward and spiritual grace and goodness at the heart of life; and her beauty is the sacred
seal which the gods have set upon her in token of her supernatural meaning and mission; for
all beauty is the message of the immortal to mortality. Always when man has been in doubt concerning
his gods, or in despair amid the darkness of his destiny, his heart has been revived by some
beatific vision;

          Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
          From our dark spirits.

Woman is our permanent Beatific Vision in the darkness of the world.

III

THE LACK OF IMAGINATION AMONG MILLIONAIRES

Considering the truly magical power of money, it must often have struck the meditative mind--particularly
that class of meditative mind whose wealth consists chiefly in meditation--to what thoroughly
commonplace uses the modern millionaire applies the power that is his: in brief, with what
little originality, with what a pitiful lack of imagination, he spends his money. One seldom
hears of his doing a novel or striking thing with it.

On the contrary, he buys precisely the same things as his fellow-millionaires, the same stereotyped
possessions--houses in Fifth Avenue and Newport, racehorses, automobiles, boxes at the opera,
diamonds and dancing girls; and whether, as the phrase is, he makes good use of his wealth,
or squanders it on his pleasures, the so-called good or bad uses are alike drearily devoid
of individuality. Philanthropist or profligate, the modern millionaire is one and the same
in his lack of initiative. Saint or sinner, he is one or the other in the same tame imitative way.

The rich men of the past, the splendid spendthrifts of antiquity, seem usually to have combined
a gift of fancy with their wealth, often even something like poetry; and their extravagances,
however extreme, had usually a saving grace of personal whim to recommend them to lovers of
the picturesque. Sardanapalus and Heliogabalus may have been whatever else you please, but
they were assuredly not commonplace; and the mere mention of their names vibrates with mankind's
perennial gratitude for splendour and colossal display, however perverse, and even absurd.
The princes of the Italian Renaissance were, of course, notable examples of the rich man as
fantast, probably because they had the good sense to seek the skilled advice of poets and painters
as to how best to make an artistic display of their possessions. Alas, no millionaire today
asks a poet's or painter's assistance in spending his money; yet, were the modern millionaire
to do so, the world might once more be delighted with such spectacles as Leonardo devised for
the entertainments at the Villa Medici--those fanciful banquets, where, instead of a mere vulgar
display of Medici money--"a hundred dollars a plate," so to say--whimsical wit and beauty entered
into the creation of the very dishes. Leicester's famous welcoming of Elizabeth to Kenilworth
was perhaps the last spectacular "revel" of its kind to strike the imagination; though we must
not fail to remember with gratitude the magnificent Beckford, with his glorious "rich man's
folly" of Fonthill Abbey, a lordly pleasure house which naturally sprang from the same Aladdin-like
fancy which produced "Vathek."

I but mention one or two such typical examples at random to illustrate the difference between
past and present. At present the rich man's paucity of originality is so painful that we even
welcome a certain millionaire's penchant for collecting fleas--he, it is rumoured, having paid
as much as a thousand dollars for specimens of a particularly rare species. It is a passion
perhaps hard to understand, but, at least, as we say, it is "different." Mr. Carnegie's more
comprehensible hobby for building libraries shows also no little originality in a man of a
class which is not as a rule devoted to literature. Another millionaire I recently read of,
who refused to pay the smallest account till it had run for five years, and would then gladly
pay it, with compound interest at five per cent., has something refreshing about him; while
still another rich eccentric, who has lived on his yacht anchored near the English coast for
some fifteen years or so in order to avoid payment of his American taxes, and who occasionally
amuses himself by having gold pieces heated white hot and thrown into the sea for diving boys
to pick them up, shows a quaint ingenuity which deserves our gratitude. Another modern example
of how to spend, or waste, one's money picturesquely was provided by the late Marquis of Anglesey,
a young lord generally regarded as crazy by an ungrateful England. Perhaps it was a little
crazy in him to spend so much money in the comparatively commonplace adventure of taking an
amateur dramatic company through the English provinces, he himself, I believe, playing but
minor rôles; but lovers of Gautier's Le Capitaine Fracasse will see in that but a charmingly
boyish desire to translate a beloved dream into a reality--though his creditors probably did
not take that view. Neither, one can surmise, did those gentlemen sufficiently appreciate his
passion for amassing amazing waistcoats, of which some seven hundred were found in his wardrobe
at his lamented death; or strange and beautiful walking sticks, a like prodigious collection
of which were among the fantastic assets which represented his originally large personal fortune
on the winding up of his earthly affairs. Among these unimaginative creditors were, doubtless,
many jewellers who found it hard to sympathize with his lordship's genial after-dinner habit,
particularly when in the society of fair women, of plunging his hand into his trousers pocket
and bringing it forth again brimming over with uncut precious stones of many colours, at the
same time begging his companion to take her choice of the moonlit rainbowed things. The Marquis
of Anglesey died at the early age of twenty-nine, much lamented, as I have hinted--by his creditors,
but no less sincerely lamented, too, by those for whom his flamboyant personality and bizarre
whims added to that gaiety of nations sadly in need today of such figures. A friend of mine
owns two of the wonderful waistcoats. Sometimes he wears one as we lunch together, and on such
occasions we always drink in silence to the memory of his fantastic lordship.

These examples of rich men of our own time who have known how to spend their money with whim
and fancy and flourish are but exceptions to my argument, lights shining, so to say, in a great
darkness. As a general rule, it is the poor or comparatively poor man, the man lacking the
very necessary material of the art, who is an artist of this kind. It is the man with but little
money who more often provides examples of the delightful way of spending it. I trust that Mr.
Richard Harding Davis will not resent my recalling a charming feat of his in this connection.
Of course Mr. Davis is by no means a poor man, as all we who admire his writings are glad to
know. Still, successful writer as he is, he is not yet, I presume, on a Carnegie or Rockefeller
rating; and, at the time which I am about to recall, while already famous and comparatively
prosperous, he had not attained that security of position which is happily his today. These year,

It was the experience, and treasure sever the run are raise to it, friend.
 On the contrary, they are apt to welcome any disparity between them and their neighbours
which tends to safeguard their leisure and protect them against the social inroads of irrelevant
persons. I recall the case of a famous novelist, who, himself jealous of his own proper seclusion,
permitted the amenities of his neighbours to pleasure his wife who was more sociably inclined,
and smilingly allowed himself to be sacrificed once a week on the altar of a domestic "at home"
day. It was amusing to see him in his drawing-room on Fridays, surrounded by every possible
form of human irrelevancy--men and women well enough in their way, of course, but absolutely
unrelated, if not antipathetic to him and all he stood for--heroically doing his best to seem
really "at home." But there came a time when he published a book of decidedly "dangerous" tendencies,
if not worse, and then it was a delight to see how those various nobodies fled his contact
as they would the plague. His drawing-room suddenly became a desert, and when you dropped in
on Fridays you found there--only the people he wanted. "Is not this," he would laughingly say,
"a triumph of natural selection? See how simply, by one honest action, I have cut off the bores!"

To cut off the bores! Yes, that is the desperate attempt that any man or woman who would live
their own lives rather than the lives of others is constantly engaged in making; and more and
more all men and women are realizing that there is only one society that really counts, the
society of people we want, rather than the people who want us or don't want us or whom we don't
want. And nowadays the man or woman must be uncomfortable or undesirable, indeed, who cannot
find all the society he or she can profitably or conveniently handle, be their opinions and
actions never so anti-Grundy. Thus the one great fear that more than any other has kept Mrs.
Grundy alive, the fear of being alone in the world, cut off from such intercourse with our
fellows as most of us feel the need of at times, has been put an end to by the ever increasing
subdivision of "society" into friendly seclusions and self-dependent communities of men and
women with like ways and points of view, however disapproved in alien circles. What "shocks"
one circle will seem perfectly natural in another; and one great truth should always be held
firmly in mind--that the approval of one's neighbours has never yet paid a man's bills. So
long as he can go on paying those, and retain the regard of the only society he values--that
of himself and a few friends--he can tell Mrs. Grundy to go--where she belongs. And this happily
is--almost--as true nowadays for woman as for man; which is the main consideration, for, it
need hardly be said, that it has been on her own sex that the tyranny of Mrs. Grundy has weighed
peculiarly hard.

Had that tyranny been based on a genuine moral ideal, one would have some respect for it, but,
as the world has always known, it has been nothing of the sort. On the contrary, it has all
along been an organized hypocrisy which condoned all it professed to censure on condition that
it was done in unhealthy secrecy, behind the closed doors of a lying "respectability." All
manner of uncleanness had been sanctioned so long as it wore a mask of "propriety," whereas
essentially clean and wholesome expressions of human nature, undisguised manifestations of
the joy and romance of life, have been suppressed and confounded with their base counterfeits
merely because they have sought the sunlight of sincerity rather than the shade where evil
does well to hide. Man's proper delight in the senses, the natural joy of men and women in
each other, the love of beauty, naked and unashamed, the romantic emotions, and all that passionate
vitality that dreams and builds and glorifies the human story: all this, forsooth, it has been
deemed wrong even to speak of, save in colourless euphemisms, and their various drama has had
to be carried on by evasion and subterfuge pitiably silly indeed in this robustly procreative
world. Silly, but how preposterous, too, and no longer to be endured.

It was a gain indeed to drag these vital human interests into the arena of undaunted discussion,
but things are clearly seen to have already passed beyond that stage. Discussion has already
set free in the world braver and truer ideals, ideals no longer afraid of life, but, in the
courage of their joyousness, feasibly close to all its breathing facts. Men and women refuse
any longer to allow their most vital instincts to be branded with obloquy, and the fulness
of their lives to be thwarted at the bidding of an impure and irrational fiction of propriety.
On every hand we find the right to happiness asserted in deeds as well as words. The essential
purity of actions and relations to which a merely technical or superstitious irregularity attaches
is being more and more acknowledged, and the fanciful barriers to human happiness are everywhere
giving way before the daylight of common sense. Love and youth and pleasure are asserting their
sacred natural rights, rights as elemental as those forces of the universe by which the stars
are preserved from wrong, and the merely legal and ecclesiastical fictions which have so long
overawed them are fleeing like phantoms at cockcrow. It is no longer sinful to be happy--even
in one's own way; and the extravagances of passion, the ebullitions of youth, and the vagaries
of pleasure are no longer frowned down by a sour-visaged public opinion, but encouraged, or,
if necessary, condoned, as the dramatic play of natural forces, and as welcome additions to
the gaiety of nations. The true sins against humanity are, on the other hand, being exposed
and pilloried with a scientific eye for their essential qualities.

          ... The cold heart, and the murderous tongue,
          The wintry soul that hates to hear a song,
          The close-shut fist, the mean and measuring eye,
          And all the little poisoned ways of wrong.

Man's virtues and vices are being subjected to a re-classification, in the course of which
they are entertainingly seen, in no few instances, to be changing places. The standards of
punishment applied by Dante to his inferno of lost souls is being, every year, more closely
approximated; warm-blooded sins of instinct and impulse, as having usually some "relish of
salvation" in them, are being judged lightly, when they are accounted sins at all, and the
cold-hearted sins of essential selfishness, the sins of cruelty and calculation and cowardice,
are being nailed up as the real crimes against God and man. The individual is being allowed
more and more to be the judge of his own actions, and all actions are being estimated more
in regard to their special relation and environment, as the relativity of right and wrong,
that most just of modern conceptions, is becoming understood. The hidden sins of the pious
and respectable are coming disastrously into the light, and it no longer avails for a man to
be a pillar of orthodoxy on Sundays if he be a pillar of oppression all the rest of the week;
while the negative virtues of abstinence from the common human pleasures go for less than nothing
in a world that no longer regards the theatre, the race course, and the card table, or even
a beautiful woman, as under the especial wrath of God. No, the Grundy "virtues" are fast disappearing,
and piano legs are once more being worn in their natural nudity. The general trend is unmistakable
and irresistible, and such apparent contradictions of it as occasionally get into the newspapers
are of no general significance; as when, for example, some exquisitely refined Irish police
officer suppresses a play of genius, or blushingly covers up the nakedness of a beautiful statue,
or comes out strong on the question of woman's bathing dress when some sensible girl has the
courage to go into the water with somewhat less than her entire walking costume; or, again,
when some crank invokes the blue laws against Sunday golf or tennis; or some spinster association
puts itself on record against woman's smoking: all these are merely provincial or parochial
exceptions to the onward movement of morals and manners, mere spasmodic twitchings, so to say,
of the poor old lady on her deathbed. We know well enough that she who would so sternly set
her face against the feminine cigarette would have no objection to one of her votaries carrying
on an affair with another woman's husband--not the least in the world, so long as she was careful
to keep it out of the courts. And such is a sample of her morality in all her dealings. Humanity
will lose no real sanctity or safeguard by her demise; only false shame and false morality
will go--but true modesty, "the modesty of nature," true propriety, true religion--and incidentally
true love and true marriage--will all be immeasurably the gainers by the death of this hypocritical,
nasty-minded old lady.

V

MODERN AIDS TO ROMANCE

There have, of course, in all ages been those who made a business of running down the times
in which they lived--tiresome people for whom everything had gone to the dogs--or was rapidly
going--uncomfortable critics who could never make themselves at home in their own century,
and whose weary shibboleth was that of some legendary perfect past.

In Rome this particular kind of bore went by the name of laudator temporis acti; and, if we
have no such concise Anglo-Saxon phrase for the type, we still have the type no less ubiquitously
with us. The bugbear of such is "modern science," or "modern thought," a monster which, we
are frequently assured, is fast devouring all the beautiful and good in human life, a Moloch
fed on the dreams and ideals and noble faiths of man. Modernity! For such "modernity" has taken
the place of "Anti-Christ." These sad, nervous people have no eye for the beautiful patterns
and fantasies of change, none of that faith which rejoices to watch "the roaring loom of time"
weaving ever new garments for the unchanging eternal gods. In new temples, strangely enough,
they see only atheism, instead of the vitality of spiritual evolution; in new affirmations
they scent only dangerous denials. With the more grave misgivings of these folk of little faith
this is not the place to deal, though actually, if there were any ground for belief in a modern
decay of religion, we might seriously begin to believe in the alleged decay of romance.

Yes, romance, we not infrequently hear, is dead. Modern science has killed it. It is essentially
a "thing of the past"--an affair presumably of stage-coaches, powdered wigs, and lace ruffles.
It cannot breathe in what is spoken of as "this materialistic age."

The dullards who repeat these platitudes of the muddle-headed multitude are surely the only
people for whom they are true. It is they alone who are the materialists, confusing as they
do the spirit of romance with its worn-out garments of bygone fashions. Such people are so
clearly out of court as not to be worth controverting, except for the opportunity they give
one of confidently making the joyous affirmation that, far from romance being dead in our day,
there never was a more romantic age than ours, and that never since the world began has it
offered so many opportunities, so many facilities for romance as at the present time.

In fact, a very little thinking will show that of all those benefited by "the blessings of
modern science," it is the lovers of the community who as a body have most to be thankful for.
Indeed, so true is this that it might almost seem as though the modern laboratory has been
run primarily from romantic motives, to the end that the old reproach should be removed and
the course of true love run magically smooth. Valuable as the telephone may be in business
affairs, it is simply invaluable in the affairs of love; and mechanicians the world over are
absorbed in the problem of aerial flight, whether they know it or not, chiefly to provide Love
with wings as swift as his desire.

Distance may lend enchantment to those whom we prefer to appreciate from afar, but nearness
is the real enchantment to your true lover, and distance is his natural enemy. Distance and
the slow-footedness of Time are his immemorial evils. Both of these modern science has all
but annihilated. Consider for a moment the conditions under which love was carried on in those
old days which some people find so romantic. Think what a comparatively short distance meant
then, with snail-paced precarious mails, and the only means of communication horses by land,
and sailing ships by sea. How men and women had the courage to go on long journeys at all away
from each other in those days is hard to realize, knowing what an impenetrable curtain of silence
and mystery immediately fell between them with the winding of the coach horn, or the last wave
of the plumed hat as it disappeared behind the last turning of the road--leaving those at home
with nothing for company but the yearning horizon and the aching, uncommunicative hours. Days,
weeks, months, even years, must go by in waiting for a word--and when at last it came, brought
on lumbering wheels or at best by some courier on his steaming mud-splashed mount, precious
as it was, it was already grown old and cold and perhaps long since untrue.

Imagine perhaps being dependent for one's heart news on some chance soldier limping back from
the wars, or some pilgrim from the Holy Land with scallop shell and staff!

Distance was indeed a form of death under such conditions--no wonder men made their wills as
they set out on a journey--and when actual physical death did not intervene, how much of that
slow death-in-life, that fading of the memory and that numbing of the affections which absence
too often brings, was even still more to be feared. The loved face might indeed return, looking
much the same as when it went away, but what of the heart that went a-journeying, too? What
even of the hearts that remained at home?

The chances of death and disaster not even modern science can forestall, though even these
it has considerably lessened; but that other death of the heart, which comes of the slow starvation
of silence and absence, it may be held to have all but vanquished. Thanks to its weird magicians,
you may be seas or continents away from her whom your soul loveth, yet "at her window bid good-morrow"
as punctually as if you lived next door; or serenade her by electricity--at all hours of the
night. If you sigh in New York, she can hear you and sigh back in San Francisco; and soon her
very face will be carried to you at any moment of the day along the magic wires. Nor will you
need to wait for the postman, but be able to read her flowerlike words as they write themselves
out on the luminous slate before you, at the very moment as she leans her fragrant bosom upon
her electric desk three thousand miles away. If this isn't romantic, one may well ask what is!

To take the telephone alone, surely the romance of Pyramus and Thisbe, with their primitive
hole in the wall, was a tame affair compared with the possibilities of this magic toy, by means
of which you can talk with your love not merely through a wall but through the Rocky Mountains.
You can whisper sweet nothings to her across the sounding sea, and bid her "sleep well" over
leagues of primeval forest, and through the stoniest-hearted city her soft voice will find
its way. Even in mid-ocean the "wireless" will bring you news of her mal-de-mer. And more than
that; should you wish to carry her voice with you from place to place, science is once more
at your service with another magic toy--the phonograph--by which indeed she can still go on
speaking to you, if you have the courage to listen, from beyond the grave.

The telegraph, the telephone, the "wireless," the phonograph, the electric letter writer--such
are the modern "conveniences" of romance; and, should an elopement be on foot, what are the
fastest post-chaise or the fleetest horses compared with a high-powered automobile? And when
the airship really comes, what romance that has ever been will compare for excitement with
an elopement through the sky?

Apart from the practical conveniences of these various new devices, there is a poetic quality
about the mere devices themselves which is full of fascination and charm. Whether we call up
our sweetheart or our stockbroker, what a thing of enchantment the telephone is merely in itself!
Such devices turn the veriest prose of life into poetry; and, indeed, the more prosaic the
uses to which we put them, the more marvellous by contrast their marvel seems. Even our businesses
are carried on by agencies more mysterious and truly magical than anything in the Arabian Nights,
and all day long we are playing with mysterious natural laws and exquisite natural forces as,
in a small way, when boys we used to delight in our experiments with oxygen and hydrogen and
Leyden jars. Science has thus brought an element of romantic "fun," so to speak, even into
our stores and our counting-houses. I wonder if "Central" realizes what a truly romantic employment
is hers?

But, pressed into the high service of love, one sees at once what a poetic fitness there is
in their employ, and how our much-abused modern science has found at last for that fastidious
god an appropriately dignified and beautiful ministrant. Coarse and vulgar indeed seem the
ancient servitors and the uncouth machinery by which the divine business of the god was carried
on of old. Today, through the skill of science, the august lightning has become his messenger,
and the hidden gnomes of air and sea hasten to do his bidding.

Modern science, then, so far from being an enemy of romance, is seen on every hand to be its
sympathetic and resourceful friend, its swift and irresistible helper in its serious need,
and an indulgent minister to its lighter fancies. Be it whim or emergency, the modern laboratory
is equally at the service of romance, equally ready to gratify mankind with a torpedo or a toy.

Not only, however, has modern science thus put itself at the service of romance, by supplying
it with its various magic machinery of communication, but modern thought--that much maligned
bugbear of timorous minds--has generated an atmosphere increasingly favourable to and sympathetic
with the romantic expression of human nature in all its forms.

The world has unmistakably grown younger again during the last twenty years, as though--which,
indeed, is the fact--it had thrown off an accumulation of mopishness, shaken itself free from
imaginary middle-aged restrictions and preoccupations. All over the world there is a wind of
youth blowing such as has not freshened the air of time since the days of Elizabeth. Once more
the spring of a new Renaissance of Human Nature is upon us. It is the fashion to be young,
and the age of romance both for men and women has been indefinitely extended. No one gives
up the game, or is expected to, till he is genuinely tired of playing it. Mopish conventions
are less and less allowed to restrict that free and joyous play of vitality dear to the modern
heart, which is the essence of all romance. More and more the world is growing to love a lover,
and one has only to read the newspapers to see how sympathetic are the times to any generous
and adventurous display of the passions.

This more humane temper is the result of many causes. The disintegration of religious superstition,
and the substitution in its stead of spiritual ideals closer to the facts of life, is one of
these. All that was good in Puritanism has been retained by the modern spirit, while its narrowing
and numbing features, its anti-human, self-mortifying, provincial side have passed or are passing
in the regenerating sunlight of what one might call a spiritual paganism, which conceives of
natural forces and natural laws as inherently pure and mysteriously sacred. Thus the way of
a man with a maid is no longer a shamefaced affair, but it is more and more realized that in
its romance and its multifarious refinements of development are the "law and the prophets,"
the "eternal meanings" of natural religion and social spirituality.

Then, too, the spread of democracy, resulting in the breaking down of caste barriers, is all
to the good of romance. Swiftly and surely Guelph and Ghibelline and break-neck orchard walls
are passing away. If Romeo and Juliet make a tragedy of it nowadays, they have only to blame
their own mismanagement, for the world is with them as it has never been before, and all sensible
fathers and mothers know it.

Again, the freer intercourse between the sexes tends incalculably to smooth that course of
true love once so proverbially rough, but now indeed in danger of being made too unexcitingly
smooth. Yet if, as a result, certain old combinations of romance are becoming obsolete, new
ones, no less picturesque, and even more vital in their drama, are being evolved every day
by the new conditions. Those very inroads being so rapidly and successfully made by woman into
the immemorial business of man, which are superficially regarded by some as dangerous to the
tenderer sentiments between men and women, are, on the contrary, merely widening the area of
romance, and will eventually develop, as they can be seen already developing, a new chivalry
and a new poetry of the sexes no less deep and far more many-sided than the old. The robuster
comradeship between the two already resulting from the more active sharing of common interests
cannot but tend to a deeper and more exhilarating union of man and woman, a completer, intenser
marriage literally of true minds as well as bodies than was possible in the old régime, when
the masculine and feminine "spheres" were kept so jealously distinct and only allowed to touch
at the elementary points of relationship. There has always been a thrill of adventure when
either has been admitted a little farther into the other's world than was customary. How thrilling,
therefore, will it be when men and women entirely share in each other's lives, without fictitious
reserves and mysteries, and face the whole adventure of life squarely and completely together,
all the more husband and wife for being comrades as well--as many men and women of the new
era are already joyously doing.

And, merely on the surface, what a new romantic element woman has introduced into the daily
drudgery of men's lives by her mere presence in their offices! She cannot always be beautiful,
poor dear, and she is not invariably gracious, it is true; yet, on the whole, how much the
atmosphere of office life has gained in amenity by the coming of the stenographer, the typewriter,
and the telephone girl, not to speak of her frequent decorative value in a world that has hitherto
been uncompromisingly harsh and unadorned! Men may affect to ignore this, and cannot afford
indeed to be too sensitive to these flowery presences that have so considerably supplanted
those misbegotten young miscreants known as office-boys, a vanishing race of human terror;
yet there she is, all the same, in spite of her businesslike airs and her prosaic tasks, silently
diffusing about her that eternal mystery which she can never lose, be her occupations never
so masculine.

There she is with her subtly wreathed hair and her absurd little lace handkerchiefs and her
furtive powder puff and her bits of immemorial ornaments and the soft sound of her skirts and
all the rest of it. Never mind how grimly and even brusquely you may be dictating to her specifications
for steel rails or the like, little wafts of perfume cannot help floating across to your rolltop
desk, and you are a man and she is a woman, for all that; and, instead of having her with you
at fag ends of your days, you have her with you all day long now--and your sisters and your
sweethearts are so much the nearer to you all day for her presence, and, whether you know it
or not, you are so much the less a brute because she is there.

Where the loss to romance comes in in these admirable new arrangements of modern commerce it
is hard to see. Of course a new element of danger is thus introduced into the routine of our
daily lives, but when was danger an enemy to romance? The "bright face" of this particular
"danger" who would be without? The beloved essayist from whom that last phrase is, of course,
adapted, declared, as we all know, that to marry is "to domesticate the recording angel." One
might say that the modern business man has officialized the ministering angel--perhaps some
other forms of angel as well.

In their work, then, as in their play, men and women are more and more coming to share with
each other as comrades, and really the fun of life seems in no wise diminished as a consequence.
Rather the contrary, it would seem, if one is to judge from the "Decameron" of the newspapers.
Yet it is not very long ago that man looked askance at woman's wistful plea to take part even
in his play. He had the old boyish fear that she would spoil the game. However, it didn't take
him long to find out his mistake and to know woman for the true "sport" that she can be. And
in that discovery it was another invention of that wicked modern science that was the chief,
if humble seeming, factor, no less than that eclipsed but inexpressibly useful instrument (of
flirtation) in the hands of a kind providence, the bicycle.

The service of the bicycle to the "emancipation of woman" movements has perhaps never been
acknowledged by the philosopher; but a little thought will make evident how far-reaching that
service has been. When that near day arrives on which woman shall call herself absolutely "free,"
should she feel inclined to celebrate her freedom by some monument of her gratitude, let the
monument be neither to man nor woman, however valiant in the fight, but simply let it take
the form of an enthroned and laurelled bicycle--for the moment woman mounted that apparently
innocent machine, it carried her on the high-road to freedom. On that she could go not only
where she pleased, but--what is even more to the point--with whom she pleased. The free companionship
of man and woman had begun. Then and forever ended the old system of courtship, which seems
so laughable and even incredible today. One was no longer expected to pay court to one's beloved,
sitting stiffly on straight-backed chairs in a chill drawing-room in the non-conducting, or
non-conducive, presence of still chillier maiden aunts. The doom of the duenna was sounded;
the chill drawing-room was exchanged for "the open road" and the whispering woodland; and soon
it is to come about that a man shall propose to his wife high up in the blue heavens, in an
airship softly swaying at anchor in the wake of the evening star.

VI

THE LAST CALL

I don't know whether or not the cry "Last call for the dining-car" affects others as it affects
me, but for me it always has a stern, fateful sound, suggestive of momentous opportunity fast
slipping away, opportunity that can never come again; and, on the occasions when I have disregarded
it, I have been haunted with a sense of the neglected "might-have-been."

Not, indeed, that the formless regret has been connected with any illusions as to the mysterious
quality of the dinner that I have thus foregone. I have been well enough aware that the only
actual opportunity thus evaded has been most probably that of an unusually bad dinner, exorbitantly
paid for. The dinner itself has had nothing to do with my feeling, which, indeed, has come
of a suggestiveness in the cry beyond the occasion, a sense conveyed by the words, in combination
with the swift speeding along of the train, of the inexorable swift passage and gliding away
of all things. Ah! so soon it will be the last call--for so many pleasant things--that we would
fain arrest and enjoy a little longer in a world that with tragic velocity is flowing away
from us, each moment, "like the waters of the torrent." O yes, all too soon it will be the
"last call" in dead earnest--the last call for the joy of life and the glory of the world.
The grass is already withering, the flower already fading; and that bird of time, with so short
a way to flutter, is relentlessly on the wing.

Now some natures hear this call from the beginning of their lives. Even their opulent spendthrift
youth is "made the more mindful that the sweet days die," by every strain of music, by every
gathered flower. All their joy is haunted, like the poetry of William Morris, with the wistful
burden of mortality. Even the summer woodlands, with all their pomp and riot of exuberant green
and gold, are anything but safe from this low sweet singing, and in the white arms of beauty,
pressed desperately close as if to imprison the divine fugitive moment, the song seems to come
nearest. Who has not held some loved face in his hands, and gazed into it with an almost agonizing
effort to realize its reality, to make eternally sure of it, somehow to wrest possession of
it and the transfiguring moment for ever, all the time pierced with the melancholy knowledge
that tomorrow all will be as if this had never been, and life once more its dull disenchanted self?

          Too soon shall morning take the stars away,
            And all the world be up and open-eyed,
          This magic night be turned to common day--
            Under the willows on the riverside.

Youth, however, can afford to enjoy even its melancholy; for the ultimate fact of which that
melancholy is a prophecy is a long way off. If one enchanted moment runs to an end, it may
be reasonably sure for a long time yet of many more enchanted moments to come. It has as yet
only taken a bite or two into the wonderful cake. And, though its poets may warn it that "youth's
a stuff does not endure," it doesn't seriously believe it. Others may have come to an end of
their cake, but its cake is going to last for ever. Alas, for the day when it is borne in upon
us with a tragic suddenness, like a miser who awakens to find that he has been robbed of his
hoard, that unaccountably the best part of the cake has been eaten, that perhaps indeed only
a few desperate crumbs remain. A bleak laughter blends now with that once luxurious melancholy.
There is a song at our window, terribly like the mockery of Mephistopheles. Our blood runs
cold. We listen in sudden fear. It is life singing out its last call.

The time of this call, the occasion and the manner of it, mercifully vary with individuals.
Some fortunate ones, indeed, never hear it till they lie on their deathbeds. Such have either
been gifted with such a generous-sized cake of youth that it has lasted all their lives, or
they have possessed a great art in the eating of it. Though I may add here that a cautious
husbanding of your cake is no good way. That way you are liable to find it grown mouldy on
your hands. No, oddly enough, it is often seen that those who all their lives have eaten their
cake most eagerly have quite a little of it left at the end. There are no hard and fast rules
for the eating of your cake. One can only find out by eating it; and, as I have said, it may
be your luck to disprove the proverb and both eat your cake and have it.

For a dreary majority, however, the cake does come to an end, and for them henceforth, as Stevenson
grimly put it, the road lies long and straight and dusty to the grave. For them that last call
is apt to come usually before sunset--and the great American question arises: What are they
going to do about it? That, of course, every one must decide for himself, according to his
inclinations and his opportunities. But a few general considerations may be of comfort and
even of greater value.

There is one thing of importance to know about this last call, that we are apt to imagine we
hear it before we actually do, from a nervous sense that it is about time for it to sound.
Our hair perhaps is growing grey, and our years beginning to accumulate. We hypnotize ourselves
with our chronology, and say with Emerson:

          It is time to grow old,
          To take in sail.

Well and good, if it is and we feel like it; but may be it isn't, and we don't. Youth is largely
a habit. So is romance. And, unless we allow ourselves to be influenced by musty conventions
and superstitions, both habits may be prolonged far beyond the moping limits of custom, and
need never be abandoned unless we become sincerely and unregretfully tired of them. I can well
conceive of an old age like that of Sophocles, as reported by Plato, who likened the fading
of the passions with the advance of age to "being set free from service to a band of madmen."

When a man feels so, all is well and comfortable with him. He has retired of his own free will
from the banquet of life, having had his fill, and is content. Our image of the last call does
not apply to him, but rather to those who, with appetites still keen, are sternly warned that
for them, willy-nilly, the banquet must soon end, and the prison fare of prosaic middle age
be henceforth their portion. No more ortolans and transporting vintages for them. Nothing but
Scotch oatmeal and occasional sarsaparilla to the end of the chapter. No wonder that some,
hearing this dread sentence, go half crazy in a frenzied effort to clutch at what remains,
run amok, so to say, in their despairing determination to have, if need be, a last "good time"
and die. Their efforts are apt to be either distasteful or pathetically comic, and the world
is apt to be cynically contemptuous of the "romantic" outbursts of aging people. For myself,
I always feel for them a deep and tender sympathy. I know that they have heard that last fearful
call to the dining-car of life--and, poor souls, they have probably found it closed. Their
mistake has been in waiting so long for the call. From various causes, they have mismanaged
their lives. They have probably lived in a numbing fear of their neighbours, who have told
them that it is bad manners to eat one's cake in public, and wicked to eat it in private; and
any one who is fool enough to allow his neighbours to live his life for him instead of living
it himself deserves what he gets, or rather doesn't get.

A wholesome oblivion of one's neighbours is the beginning of wisdom. Neighbours, at the best,
are an impertinent encroachment on one's privacy, and, at the worst, an unnatural hindrance
to our development. Generally speaking, it is the man or woman who has lived with least fear
of his neighbours, who is least likely to hear that last call. Nothing in retrospect is so
barren as a life lived in accordance with the hypocrisies of society. For those who have never
lived, and are now fain to begin living when it is too late, that last call comes indeed with
a ghastly irony. But for those who have fearlessly lived their lives, as they came along, with
Catullus singing their vivamus atque amemus, and practising it, too; for those, if indeed the
last call must come, they will be able to support it by the thought that, often as in the past
life has called to them, it has never called to them in vain. We are apt sometimes to belittle
our memories, but actually they are worth a good deal; and should the time come when we have
little to look forward to, it will be no small comfort to have something to look back on. And
it won't be the days when we didn't that we shall recall with a sense of possession, but the
days and nights when we most emphatically did. Thank God, we did for once hold that face in
our hands in the woodland! Thank God, we did get divinely drunk that wild night of nights in
the city!

It is the fine excesses of life that make it worth living. The stalks of the days are endurable
only because they occasionally break into flower. It is our sins of omission alone that we
come in the end to regret. The temptations we resisted in our youth make themselves rods to
scourge our middle age. I regret the paradoxical form these platitudes have unconsciously taken,
for that they are the simplest truth any honest dying man would tell you. And that phrase recalls
a beautiful poem by "E. Nesbit" which has haunted me all my life, a poem I shall beg leave
to quote here, because, though it is to be found in that poet's volume, it is not, I believe,
as well known as it deserves to be by those who need its lesson. I quote it, too, from memory,
so I trust that the length of time I have remembered it may be set to my credit against any
verbal mistakes I make.

          "If, on some balmy summer night,
          You rowed across the moon path white,
          And saw the shining sea grow fair
          With silver scales and golden hair,
          What would you do?"

                        "I would be wise
          And shut my ears and shut my eyes,
          Lest I should leap into the tide
          And clasp the seamaid as I died."

          "But if you thus were strong to flee
          From sweet spells woven of moon and sea,
          Are you quite sure that you would reach,
          Without one backward look, the beach?"

          "I might look back, my dear, and then
          Row straight into the snare again,
          Or, if I safely got away--
          Regret it to my dying day."

He who liveth his life shall live it. It is a grave error to give ourselves grudgingly to our
experiences. Only in a whole-hearted surrender of ourselves to the heaven-sent moment do we
receive back all it has to give us, and by the active receptivity of our natures attract toward
us other such moments, as it were, out of the sky. An ever-ready romantic attitude toward life
is the best preservative against the ennui of the years.

And the spirit of the times is happily growing more clement toward a greater fulness and variety
of life. The world is growing kinder toward the fun and foolishness of existence, and the energetic
pursuit of joy is no longer frowned down by anaemic and hypocritical philosophies. The old
gods of energy and joy are coming to their own again, and the lives of strong men and fair
women are no longer ruled over by a hierarchy of curates and maiden aunts; in fact, the maiden
aunt has begun to find out her mistake, and is out for her share of the fun and the foolishness
with the rest. Negative morality is fast becoming discredited, and many an old "Thou shalt
not" is coming to seem as absurd as the famous Blue Laws of Connecticut. "Self-development,
not self-sacrifice,"--a favourite dictum of Grant Allen's,--is growing more and more to be
the formula of the modern world; and, if a certain amount of self-sacrifice is of necessity
included in a healthy self-development, the proportion is being reduced to a rational limit.
One form of self-sacrifice, at all events, is no longer demanded of us--the wholesale sacrifice
of our own opinions. The possibility that there may be two opinions or a dozen or a hundred
on one matter, and that they may be all different, yet each one of them right in its proper
application, has dawned forcibly on the world, with the conception of the relativity of experience
and the modification of conditions. Nowadays we recognize that there are as many "rights" and
as many "wrongs" as there are individuals; and to be happy in our own way, instead of somebody
else's, is one of the first laws of nature, health, and virtue. Many an ancient restriction
on personal vitality is going the way of the old sumptuary laws. We have all of us amusing
memories of those severe old housekeepers who for no inclemency of the weather would allow
a fire in the grate before the first of October, and who regarded a fire before that date as
a positive breach of the moral law. Such old wives are a type of certain old-fashioned moralists
whose icy clutch on our warm-blooded humanity we no longer suffer. Nowadays we light our fires
as we have a mind to, and if we prefer to keep them going all the year round, it is no one's
business but our own. Happy is the man who, when the end comes, can say with Landor:

          I warmed both hands before the fire of life;
          It sinks and I am ready to depart.

Such a one will have little need to fear that last call of which I have been writing. In Kipling's
phrase, he has taken his fun where he found it, and his barns are well stocked with the various
harvests of the years. Not his the wild regret for having "safely got away." Rather he laughs
to remember how often he was taken captive by the enchantments of the world, how whenever there
was any piece of wildness afoot he was always found in the thick of it. When the bacchantes
were out on Mount Cithaeron, and the mad Evoe! Evoe! rang through the moonstruck woods, be
sure he was up and away, with ardent hands clutched in the flying tresses. Ah! the vine leaves
and the tiger skins and the ivory bodies, the clash of the cymbals and the dithyramb shrilling
up to the stars! "If I forget thee, O golden Aphrodite!" He is no hypocrite, no weary "king
ecclesiast," shaking his head over the orgies of sap and song in which he can no longer share.
He frankly acknowledges that then came in the sweet o' the year, and he is still as young as
the youngest by virtue of having drunk deep of the only elixir, the Dionysiac cup of life.

At the same time, while he may not ungratefully rejoice with Sophocles at being "set free from
service to a band of madmen," that ripening of his nature which comes most fruitfully of a
generous exercise of its powers will have instinctively taught him that secret of the transmutation
of the passions which is one of the most precious rewards of experience. It is quite possible
for a lifelong passion for fair women to become insensibly and unregretfully transmuted into
a passion for first editions, and you may become quite sincerely content that a younger fellow
catch the flying maiden, if only you can catch yon flitting butterfly for your collection.
And, strangest of all, your grand passion for your own remarkable self may suffer a miraculous
transformation into a warm appreciation for other people. It is true that you may smile a little
sadly to find them even more interesting than yourself. But such passing sadness has the relish
of salvation in it. Self is a weary throne, and the abdication of the ego is to be free of
one of the burdens rather than the pleasures of existence.

But, to conclude, it is all too possible that you who read this may have no such assets of
a wilful well spent life to draw on as he whom I have pictured. It may be that you have starved
your emotions and fled your opportunities, or you may simply have had bad luck. The golden
moments seldom came your way. The wilderness of life has seldom blossomed with a rose. "The
breast of the nymph in the brake" and "the chimes at midnight" were not for you. And there
is a menacing murmur of autumn in the air. The days are shortening, and the twilight comes
early, with a chilly breath. The crickets have stopped singing, and the garden is sad with
elegiac blooms. The chrysanthemum is growing on the grave of the rose. Perhaps already it is
too late--too late for life and joy. You must take to first editions and entomology and other
people's interests in good earnest. But no! Suddenly on the wind there comes a cry--a sound
of cymbals and flutes and dancing feet. It is life's last call. You have one chance left. There
is still Indian summer. It is better than nothing. Hurry and join the music, ere it be too
late. For this is the last call!

          When time lets slip a little perfect hour,
          Take it, for it will not come again.

VII

THE PERSECUTIONS OF BEAUTY

All religions have periods in their history which are looked back to with retrospective fear
and trembling as eras of persecution, and each religion has its own book of martyrs. The religion
of beauty is no exception. Far from it. For most other religions, however they may have differed
among themselves, have agreed in fearing beauty, and even in Greece there were stern sanctuaries
and ascetic academes where the white bosom of Phryne would have pleaded in vain. Christianity
has not been beauty's only enemy, by any means; though, when the Book of Martyrs of Beauty
comes to be written, it will, doubtless, be the Christian persecutions of beauty that will
bulk largest in the record--for the Beauty of Holiness and the Holiness of Beauty have been
warring creeds from the beginning.

At the present moment, there is reason to fear, or to rejoice--according to one's individual
leanings--that the Religion of Beauty is gaining upon its ancient rival; for perhaps never
since the Renaissance has there been such a widespread impulse to assert Beauty and Joy as
the ideals of human life. As evidence one has but to turn one's eyes on the youth of both sexes,
as they rainbow the city thoroughfares with their laughing, heartless faces, evident children
of beauty and joy, "pagan" to the core of them, however ostensibly Christian their homes and
their country. In our time, at all events, Beauty has never walked the streets with so frank
a radiance, so confident an air of security, and in her eyes and in her carriage, as in her
subtly shaped and subtly scented garments, so conspicuous a challenge to the musty, outworn,
proprieties to frown upon her all they please. From the humblest shop-girl to the greatest
lady, there is apparent an intention to be beautiful, sweet maid, and let who will be hum-drum,
at whatever cost, by whatever means. This, of course, at all periods, has been woman's chief
thought, but till recently, in our times, she has more or less affected a certain secrecy in
her intention. She has hinted rather than fully expressed it, as though fearing a certain flagrancy
in too public an exhibition of her enchantments. It has hardly seemed proper to her heretofore
to be as beautiful in the public gaze as in the sanctuary of her boudoir. But now, bless you,
she has no such misgivings, and the flower-like effect upon the city streets is as dazzling
as if, some fine morning in Constantinople, all the ladies of the various harems should suddenly
appear abroad without their yashmaks, setting fire to the hearts and turning the heads of the
unaccustomed male. Or, to make comparison nearer home, it is almost as startling as if the
ladies of the various musical comedies in town should suddenly be let loose upon our senses
in broad daylight, in all the adorable sorceries of "make-up" and diaphanous draperies. I swear
that it can be no more thrilling to penetrate into that mysterious paradise "behind the scenes,"
than to walk up Fifth Avenue one of these summer afternoons, in the present year of grace,--humming
to one's self that wistful old song, which goes something like this:

          The girls that never can be mine!
            In every lane and street
          I hear the rustle of their gowns,
            The whisper of their feet;
          The sweetness of their passing by,
            Their glances strong as wine,
          Provoke the unpossessive sigh--
            Ah! girls that never can be mine.

So audacious has Beauty become in these latter days, so proudly she walks abroad, making so
superb an appeal to the desire of the eye, thighed like Artemis, and bosomed like Aphrodite,
or at whiles a fairy creature of ivory and gossamer and fragrance, with a look in her eyes
of secret gardens; and so much is the wide world at her feet, and one with her in the vanity
of her fairness--that I sometimes fear an impending dies irae, when the dormant spirit of Puritanism
will reassert itself, and some stern priests thunder from the pulpit of worldly vanities and
the wrath to come. Indeed, I can well imagine in the near future some modern Savonarola presiding
over a new Bonfire of Vanities in Madison Square, on which, to the droning of Moody and Sankey's
hymns, shall be cast all the fascinating Parisian creations, the puffs and rats, the powder
and the rouge, the darling stockings, and all such concomitant bewitcheries that today make
Manhattan a veritable Isle of Circe, all to go up in savage sectarian flame, before the eyes
of melancholy young men, and filling all the city with the perfume of beauty's holocaust. At
street corners too will stand great books in which weeping maidens will sign their names, swearing
before high heaven, to wear nothing but gingham and bed-ticking for the dreary remainder of
their lives. Such a day may well come, as it has often come before, and certainly will, if
women persist in being so deliberately beautiful as they are at present.

It is curious how, from time immemorial, man seems to have associated the idea of evil with
beauty, shrunk from it with a sort of ghostly fear, while, at the same time drawn to it by
force of its hypnotic attraction. Strangely enough, beauty has been regarded as the most dangerous
enemy of the soul, and the powers of darkness that are supposed to lie in wait for that frail
and fluttering psyche, so precious and apparently so perishable, are usually represented as
taking shapes of beguiling loveliness--lamias, loreleis, wood nymphs, and witches with blue
flowers for their eyes. Lurking in its most innocent forms, the grim ascetic has affected to
find a leaven of concupiscence, and whenever any reformation is afoot, it is always beauty
that is made the first victim, whether it take the form of a statue, a stained-glass window,
or a hair-ribbon. "Homeliness is next to Godliness," though not officially stated as an article
of the Christian creed, has been one of the most active of all Christian tenets. It has always
been easier far for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than a gloriously beautiful woman.
Presumably such a one might be in danger of corrupting the saints, somewhat unaccustomed to
such apparitions.

In this Christian fear and hatred of beauty the democratic origin of the Christian religion
is suggestively illustrated, for beauty, wherever found, is always mysteriously aristocratic,
and thus instinctively excites the fear and jealousy of the common people. When, in the third
century, Christian mobs set about their vandalistic work of destroying the "Pagan" temples,
tearing down the beautiful calm gods and goddesses from their pedestals, and breaking their
exquisite marble limbs with brutish mallets, it was not, we may be sure, of the danger to their
precious souls they were thinking, but of their patrician masters who had worshipped these
fair images, and paid great sums to famous sculptors for such adornment of their sanctuaries.
Perhaps it was human enough, for to those mobs beauty had long been associated with oppression.
Yet how painful to picture those golden marbles, in all their immortal fairness, confronted
with the hideousness of those fanatic ill-smelling multitudes. Wonderful religionists, forsooth,
that thus break with foolish hands and trample with swinish hoofs the sacred vessels of divine
dreams.

One can imagine the priest of such a violated sanctuary stealing back in the quiet moonlight,
when all the mob fury had passed away, seeking amid all the wrack of fallen columns, and shattered
carvings, for any poor fragments of god or goddess at whose tranquil fair-ordered altar he
had ministered so long; and gathering such as he might find,--maybe a mighty hand, still the
hand of a god, albeit in overthrow, or some marble curls of the sculptured ambrosial locks,
or maybe the bruised breast of the goddess, white as a water-lily in the moon. Then, seeking
out some secret corner of the sacred grove, how reverently he would bury the precious fragments
away from profane eyes, and go forth homeless into a mysterious changing world, from which
glory and loveliness were thus surely passing away. Other priests, as we know, more fortunate
than he, had forewarnings of such impending sacrilege, and were able to anticipate the mob,
and bury their beautiful images in safe and secret places, there to await, after the lapse
of twelve centuries, the glorious resurrection of the Renaissance. A resurrection, however,
by no means free from danger, even in that resplendent dawn of intelligence; for Christianity
was still the enemy of beauty, save in the Vatican, and the ignorant priest of the remote village
where the spade of the peasant had revealed the sleeping marble was certain to declare the
beautiful image an evil spirit, and have it broken up forthwith and ground for mortar, unless
some influential scholar, or powerful lord touched with "the new learning," chanced to be on
hand to save it from destruction. Yes! even at that time when beauty was being victoriously
born again, the mad fear of her raged with such panic in certain minds that, when Savonarola
lit his great bonfire so subtle a servant of beauty as Botticelli, fallen into a sort of religious
dotage, cast his own paintings into the flames--to the lugubrious rejoicings of the sanctimonious
Piagnoni--as Savonarola's followers were called; predecessors of those still gloomier zealots
who, two centuries later, were to turn England into a sort of whitewashed prison, with crop-headed
psalm-singing religious maniacs for gaolers. When Charles the First

          bow'd his comely head
       Down, as upon a bed,

at Whitehall, Beauty also laid her head upon the block at his side. Ugliness, parading as piety,
took her place, and once more the breaking of images began, the banishment of music, the excommunication
of grace, and gentle manners, and personal adornments. Gaiety became penal, and a happy heart
or a beautiful smile was of the devil,--something like hanging matters--but happy hearts and
beautiful smiles must have been rare things in England during the Puritan Commonwealth. Doubtless,
that English Puritan persecution was the severest that Beauty has been called upon to endure.
She still suffers from it, need one say, to this day, particularly in New England, where if
the sculptured images of goddess and nymph are not exactly broken to pieces by the populace,
it is from no goodwill towards them, but rather from an ingrained reverence for any form of
property, even though it be nude, and where, at all events, they are under the strict surveillance
of a highly proper and respectable police, those distinguished guardians of American morals.

It is worth while to try and get at the reason for this wide-spread, deep-rooted, fear of beauty:
for some reason there must surely be. Such instinctive feelings, on so broad a scale, are not
accidental. And so soon as one begins to analyse the attitude of religion towards beauty, the
reason is not far to seek.

All religions are made up of a spiritual element and a moral element, the moral element being
the temporary, practical, so to say, working side of religion, concerned with this present
world, and the limitations and necessities of the various societies that compose it. The spiritual
element, the really important part of religion, has no concern with Time and Space, temporary
mundane laws, or conduct. It concerns itself only with the eternal properties of things. Its
business is the contemplation and worship of the mystery of life, "the mystery we make darker
with a name."

Now, great popular religions, designed as they are for the discipline and control of the great
brute masses of humanity, are almost entirely occupied with morality, and what passes in them
for spirituality is merely mythology, an element of picturesque supernaturalism calculated
to enforce the morality with the multitude. Christianity is such a religion. It is mostly a
matter of conduct here and now upon the earth. Its mystic side does not properly belong to
it, and is foreign to, not to speak of its being practically ignored by, the average "Christian."
It is a religion designed to work hand in hand with a given state of society, making for the
preservation of such laws and manners and customs as are best fitted to make that society a
success here and now, a worldly success in the best sense of the term. Mohammedanism is a similar
religion calculated for the needs of a different society. Whatever the words or intentions
of the founders of such religions, their kingdoms are essentially of this world. They are not
mystic, or spiritual, or in anyway concerned with infinite and eternal things. Their business
is the moral policing of humanity. Morality, as of course its name implies, is a mere matter
of custom, and therefore varies with the variations of races and climates. It has nothing to
do with spirituality, and, in fact, the best morals are often the least spiritual, and vice
versa. It will be understood then that any force which is apt to disturb this moral, or more
exactly speaking social, order will meet at once with the opposition of organized "religions"
so called, and the more spiritual it is, the greater will be the opposition, for it will thus
be the more dangerous.

Now one begins to see why Beauty is necessarily the bugbear, more or less, of all religions,
or, as I prefer to regard them, "organized moralities"; for Beauty is neither moral nor immoral,
being as she is a purely spiritual force, with no relations to man's little schemes of being
good and making money and being knighted and so forth. For those who have eyes to see, she
is the supreme spiritual vision vouchsafed to us upon the earth--and, as that, she is necessarily
the supreme danger to that materialistic use and wont by which alone a materialistic society
remains possible. For this reason our young men and maidens--particularly our young men--must
be guarded against her, for her beauty sets us adream, prevents our doing our day's work, makes
us forget the soulless occupations in which we wither away our lives. The man who loves beauty
will never be mayor of his city, or even sit on the Board of Aldermen. Nor is he likely to
own a railroad, or be a captain of industry. Nor will he marry, for her money, a woman he does
not love. The face of beauty makes all such achievements seem small and absurd. Such so-called
successes seem to him the dreariest forms of failure. In short, Beauty has made him divinely
discontented with the limited human world about him, divinely incapable of taking it seriously,
or heeding its standards or conditions. No wonder society should look upon Beauty as dangerous,
for she is constantly upsetting its equilibrium and playing havoc with its smooth schemes and
smug conventions. She outrages the "proprieties" with "the innocence of nature," and disintegrates
"select" and "exclusive" circles with the wand of Romance. For earthly possessions or rewards
she has no heed. For her they are meaningless things, mere idle dust and withered leaves. Her
only real estate is in the moon, and the one article of her simple creed--"Love is enough."

       Love is enough: though the world be a-waning
       And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
       Though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to discover
       The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
       Though the hills beheld shadows, and the sea a dark wonder
       And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
       Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter;
       The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
       These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.

Those who have looked into her eyes see limitless horizons undreamed of by those who know her
not, horizons summoning the soul to radiant adventures beyond the bounds of Space and Time.
The world is so far right in regarding beauty with a sort of superstitious dread, as a presence
almost uncanny among our mere mortal concerns, a daemonic thing,--which is what the world has
meant when it has, not unnaturally, confused it with the spirits of evil; for surely it is
a supernatural stranger in our midst, a fairy element, and, like the lorelei and the lamia,
it does beckon its votaries to enchanted realms away and afar from "all the uses of the world."
Therefore, to them also it brings the thrill of a different and nobler fear--the thrill of
the mortal in presence of the immortal. A strange feeling of destiny seems to come over us
as we first look into the beautiful face we were born to love. It seems veritably an apparition
from another and lovelier world, to which it summons us to go with it. That is what we mean
when we say that Love and Death are one; for Death, to the thought of Love, is but one of the
gates to that other world, a gate to which we instinctively feel Love has the key. That surely
is the meaning of the old fairy-stories of men who have come upon the white woman in the woodland,
and followed her, never to be seen again of their fellows, or of those who, like Hylas, have
met the water-nymph by the lilied spring, and sunk with her down into the crystal deeps. The
strange earth on which we live is just such a place of enchantment, neither more nor less,
and some of us have met that fair face, with a strange suddenness of joy and fear, and followed
and followed it on till it vanished beyond the limits of the world. But our failure was that
we did not follow that last white beckoning of the hand--

          And I awoke and found me here
            On the cold hill's side.

VIII

THE MANY FACES--THE ONE DREAM

Among the many advantages of being very young is one's absolute certainty that there is only
one type of beautiful girl in the world. That type we make a religion. We are its pugnacious
champions, and the idea of our falling in love with any other is too preposterous even for
discussion. If our tastes happen to be for blondness, brunettes simply do not exist for us;
and if we affect the slim and willowy in figure, our contempt for the plump and rounded is
too sincere for expression. Usually the type we choose is one whose beauty is somewhat esoteric
to other eyes. We are well aware that photographs do it no justice, and that the man in the
street--who, strangely enough, we conceive as having no eye for beauty--can see nothing in
it. Thank Heaven, she is not the type that any common eye can see. Heads are not turned in
her wake as she passes along. Her beauty is not "obvious." On the contrary, it is of that rare
and exquisite quality which only a few favoured ones can apprehend--like the beauty of a Whistler
or a Corot, and we have been chosen to be its high-priest and evangelist. It is our secret,
this beautiful face that we love, and we wonder how any one can be found to love the other
faces. We even pity them, those rosy, rounded faces, with their bright unmysterious eyes and
straight noses and dimpled chins. How fortunate for them that the secret of the beauty we love
has been hidden from their lovers. Sheer Bouguereau! Neither more nor less.

In fact, the beauty we affect is aggressively spiritual, and in so far as beauty is demonstrably
physical we dismiss it with disdain. Our ideal, indeed, might be said to consist in a beauty
which is beautiful in spite of the body rather than by means of it; a beauty defiantly clothed,
so to say, in the dowdiest of fleshly garments--radiantly independent of such carnal conditions
as features or complexion. Our ideal of figure might be said to be negative rather than positive,
and that "little sister" mentioned in Solomon's Song would bring us no disappointment.

We are often heard to say that beauty consists chiefly, if not entirely, in expression, that
it is a transfiguration from within rather than a gracious condition of the surface, that the
shape of a nose is no matter, and that a beautifully rounded chin or a fine throat has nothing
to do with it--indeed, is rather in the way than otherwise. We point to the fact--which is
true enough--that the most famous beauties of antiquity were plain women--plain, that is, according
to the conventional standards.

We also maintain--again with perfect truth--that mystery is more than half of beauty, the element
of strangeness that stirs the senses through the imagination. These and other perfectly true
truths about beauty we discover through our devotion to the one face that we love--and we should
hardly have discovered them had we begun with the merely cherry-ripe. It is with faces much
as it is with books. There is no way of attaining a vital catholic taste in literature so good
as to begin by mastering some difficult beautiful classic, by devoting ourselves in the ardent
receptive period of youth to one or two masterpieces which will serve as touchstones for us
in all our subsequent reading. Some books engage all our faculties for their appreciation,
and through the keen attentiveness we are compelled to give them we make personal discovery
of those principles and qualities of all fine literature which otherwise we might never have
apprehended, or in which, at all events, we should have been less securely grounded.

So with faces: it is through the absorbed worship, the jealous study, of one face that we best
learn to see the beauty in all the other faces--though the mere thought that our apprehension
of its beauty could ever lead us to so infidel a conclusion would seem heresy indeed during
the period of our dedication. The subtler the type, the more caviare it is to the general,
the more we learn from it. We become in a sense discoverers, original thinkers, of beauty,
taking nothing on authority, but making trial and investigation always for ourselves. Such
beauty brings us nearer than the more explicit types to that mysterious threshold over which
beauty steps down to earth and dwells among us; that well-spring of its wonder; the point where
first its shining essence pours its radiance into the earthly vessel.

The perfect physical type hides no little of its own miracle through its sheer perfection,
as in the case of those masterpieces which, as we say, conceal their art. It is often through
the face externally less perfect, faces, so to say, in process of becoming beautiful, that
we get glimpses of the interior light in its divine operation. We seem to look into the very
alembic of beauty, and see all the precious elements in the act of combination. No wonder we
should deem these faces the most beautiful of all, for through them we see, not beauty made
flesh, but beauty while it is still spirit. In our eager fanaticism, indeed, we cannot conceive
that there can be beauty in any other types as well. Yet, because we chance to have fallen
under the spell of Botticelli, shall there be no more Titian? Our taste is for a beauty of
dim silver and faded stars, a wistful twilight beauty made of sorrow and dreams, a beauty always
half in the shadow, a white flower in the moonlight. We cannot conceive how beauty, for others,
can be a thing of the hot sun, a thing of purple and orange and the hot sun, a thing of firm
outlines, superbly concrete, marmoreal, sumptuous, magnificently animal.

The beauty we love is very silent. It smiles softly to itself, but never speaks. How should
we understand a beauty that is vociferously gay, a beauty of dash and dance, a beauty of swift
and brilliant ways, victoriously alive?

Perhaps it were well for us that we should never understand, well for us that we should preserve
our singleness of taste through life. Some contrive to do this, and never as long as they live
are unfaithful to the angel-blue eyes of their boyish love. Moralists have perhaps not realized
how much continence is due to a narrowness of aesthetic taste. Obviously the man who sees beauty
only in blue eyes is securer from temptation than the man who can see beauty in brown or green
eyes as well; and how perilous is his state for whom danger lurks in all beautiful eyes, irrespective
of shape, size, or colour! And, alas! it is to this state of eclecticism that most of us are
led step by step by the Mephistopheles of experience.

As great politicians in their maturity are usually found in the exact opposite party to that
which they espoused in their youth, so men who loved blondness in boyhood are almost certain
to be found at the feet of the raven-haired in their middle age, and vice versa. The change
is but a part of that general change which overtakes us with the years, substituting in us
a catholic appreciation of the world as it is for idealist notions of the world as we see it,
or desire it to be. It is a part of that gradual abdication of the ego which comes of the slow
realization that other people are quite as interesting as ourselves--in fact, a little more
so,--and their tastes and ways of looking at things may be worth pondering, after all. But,
O when we have arrived at this stage, what a bewildering world of seductive new impressions
spreads for us its multitudinous snares! No longer mere individuals, we have not merely an
individual's temptations to guard against, but the temptations of all the world. Instead of
being able to see only that one type of beauty which first appealed to us, our eyes have become
so instructed that we now see the beauty of all the other types as well; and we no longer scorn
as Philistine the taste of the man in the street for the beauty that is robustly vital and
flamboyantly contoured. Once we called it obvious. Now we say it is "barbaric," and call attention
to its perfection of type.

The remembrance of our former injustice to it may even awaken a certain tenderness towards
it in our hearts, and soon we find ourselves making love to it, partly from a vague desire
to make reparation to a slighted type, and partly from the experimental pleasure of loving
a beauty the attraction of which it was once impossible for us to imagine. So we feel when
the charm of some old master, hitherto unsympathetic, is suddenly revealed to us. Ah! it was
this they saw. How blind they must have thought us!

Brown eyes that I love, will you forgive me that I once looked into blue eyes as I am looking
now into yours? Hair black as Erebus, will you forgive these hands that once loved to bathe
in a brook of rippled gold? Ah! they did not know. It was in ignorance they sinned. They did
not know.

O my beautiful cypress, stately queen of the garden of the world, forgive me that once I gave
to the little shrub-like women the worship that is rightly yours!

Lady, whose loveliness is like white velvet, a vineyard heavy with golden grapes, abundant
as an orchard of apple blossoms, forgive that once I loved the shadow women, the sad wreathing
mists of beauty, the silvery uncorseted phantoms of womanhood. It was in ignorance I sinned.
I did not know.

Ah! That Mephistopheles of experience! How he has led us from one fair face to another, teaching
us, one by one, the beauty of all. No longer lonely sectarians of beauty, pale prophets of
one lovely face, there is now no type whose secret is hidden from us. The world has become
a garden of beautiful faces. The flowers are different, but they are all beautiful. How is
it possible for us, now that we know the charm of each one, to be indifferent to any, or to
set the beauty of one above the other? We have learned the beauty of the orchid, but surely
we have not unlearned the rose; and would you say that orchid or rose is more beautiful than
the lily? Surely not. They are differently beautiful, that is all.

Are blue eyes more beautiful than brown? I thought so once, but now I see that they are differently
beautiful, that is all. Nor is gold hair more beautiful than black any more, or black than
gold. They are differently beautiful, that is all. Nor is thy white skin, O Saxon lady, more
beautiful than hers of tropic bronze.

Come sad, or come with laughter, beautiful faces; come like stars in dreams, or come vivid
as fruit upon the bough; come softly like a timid fawn, or terrible as an army with banners;
come silent, come singing ... you are all beautiful, and none is fairer than another--only
differently fair.

And yet ... and yet ... Experience is indeed Mephistopheles in this: We must pay him for all
this wisdom. Is it the old price? Is it our souls? I wonder.

This at least is true: that, while indeed he has opened our eyes to all this beauty that was
hidden to us, shown us beauty, indeed, where we could see but evil before, we miss something
from our delight in these faces. We can appreciate more beauty, but do we appreciate any quite
as much as in those old days when we were such passionate monotheists of the beautiful? Alas!
We are priests no more, are we even lovers? But we are wonderful connoisseurs.

It is our souls. As I transcribe once more that ancient sigh, perhaps the most real sigh in
all literature, it is high mid-summer, and the woodland surrounding the little cabin in which
I am writing lies in a trance of green and gold, hot and fragrant and dizzy with the whirring
of cicadas, under the might of the July sun. Bees buzz in and out through my door, and sometimes
a butterfly flits in, flutters a while about my bookshelves, and presently is gone again, in
search of sweets more to his taste than those of the muses, though Catullus is there, with

          Songs sweeter than wild honey dripping down,
          Which once in Rome to Lesbia he sang.

As I am caught by the dream-drowsy spell of the hot murmuring afternoon, and my eyes rest on
the thick vines clustering over the rocks, and the lush grasses and innumerable underbrush,
so spendthrift in their crowding luxuriance, I try to imagine the ground as it was but four
months ago still in the grasp of winter, when the tiniest blade of grass, or smallest speck
of creeping green leaf, seemed like a miracle, and it was impossible to realize that under
the broad snowdrifts a million seeds, like hidden treasure, were waiting to reveal their painted
jewels to the April winds. Snow was plentiful then, to be had by the ton--but now, the thought
suddenly strikes me, and brings home with new illuminating force Villon's old refrain, that
though I sought the woodland from end to end, ransacked its most secret places, not one vestige
of that snow, so lately here in such plenty, would it be possible to find. Though you were
to offer me a million dollars for as much as would fill the cup of a wild rose, say even a
hundred million, I should have to see all that money pass me by. I can think of hardly anything
that it couldn't buy--but such a simple thing as last year's snow!

Could there be a more poignant symbol of irreclaimable vanished things than that so happily
hit on by the old ballade-maker:

          Nay, never ask this week, fair lord,
            Where they are gone, nor yet this year,
          Save with thus much for an overword--
            But where are the snows of yester-year?

Villon, as we know, has a melancholy fondness for asking these sad, hopeless questions of snow
and wind. He muses not only of the drift of fair faces, but of the passing of mighty princes
and all the arrogant pride and pomp of the earth--"pursuivants, trumpeters, heralds, hey!"
"Ah! where is the doughty Charlemagne?" They, even as the humblest, "the wind has carried them
all away." They have vanished utterly as the snow, gone--who knows where?--on the wind. "'Dead
and gone'--a sorry burden of the Ballad of Life," as Thomas Lowell Beddoes has it in his Death's
Jest Book. "Dead and gone!" as Andrew Lang re-echoes in a sweetly mournful ballade:

          Through the mad world's scene
            We are drifting on,
          To this tune, I ween,
            "They are dead and gone!"

"Nought so sweet as melancholy," sings an old poet, and, while the melancholy of the exercise
is undoubted, there is at the same time an undeniable charm attaching to those moods of imaginative
retrospect in which we summon up shapes and happenings of the vanished past, a tragic charm
indeed similar to that we experience in mournful music or elegiac poetry.

For, it is impossible to turn our eyes on any point of the starlit vista of human history,
without being overwhelmed with a heart-breaking sense of the immense treasure of radiant human
lives that has gone to its making, the innumerable dramatic careers now shrunk to a mere mention,
the divinely passionate destinies, once all wild dream and dancing blood, now nought but a
name huddled with a thousand such in some dusty index, seldom turned to even by the scholar,
and as unknown to the world at large as the moss-grown name on some sunken headstone in a country
churchyard. What an appallingly exuberant and spendthrift universe it seems, pouring out its
multitudinous generations of men and women with the same wasteful hand as it has filled this
woodland with millions of exquisite lives, marvellously devised, patterned with inexhaustible
fancy, mysteriously furnished with subtle organs after their needs, crowned with fairy blossoms,
and ripening with magic seeds,--such a vast treasure of fragrant sunlit leafage, all produced
with such elaborate care, and long travail, and all so soon to vanish utterly away!

Along with this crushing sense of cosmic prodigality, and somewhat lighting up its melancholy,
comes the inspiring realization of the splendid spectacle of human achievement, the bewildering
array of all the glorious lives that have been lived, of all the glorious happenings, under
the sun. Ah! what men this world has seen, and--what women! What divine actors have trod this
old stage, and in what tremendous dramas have they taken part! And how strange it is, reading
some great dramatic career, of Caesar, say, or Luther, or Napoleon, or Byron, to realize that
there was a time when they were not, then a time when they were beginning to be strange new
names in men's ears, then all the romantic excitement of their developing destinies, and the
thunder and lightning of the great resounding moments of their lives--moments made out of real,
actual, prosaic time, just as our own moments are made, yet once so splendidly shining on the
top of the world, as though to stay there forever, moments so glorious that it would seem that
Time must have paused to watch and prolong them, jealous that they should ever pass and give
place to lesser moments!

Think too of those other fateful moments of history, moments not confined to a few godlike
individuals, but participated in by whole nations, such moments as that of the great Armada,
the French Revolution, or the Declaration of American Independence. How strangely it comes
upon one that these past happenings were once only just taking place, just as at the moment
of my writing other things are taking place, and clocks were ticking and water flowing, just
as they are doing now! How wonderful, it seems to us, to have been alive then, as we are alive
now, to have shared in those vast national enthusiasms, "in those great deeds to have had some
little part"; and is it not a sort of poor anti-climax for a world that has gone through such
noble excitement to have sunk back to this level of every day! Alas! all those lava-like moments
of human exaltation--what are they now, but, so to say, the pumice-stone of history. They have
passed as the summer flowers are passing, they are gone with last year's snow.

But the last year's snow of our personal lives--what a wistful business it is, when we get
thinking of that! To recall certain magic moments out of the past is to run a risk of making
the happiest present seem like a desert; and for most men, I imagine, such retrospect is usually
busied with some fair face, or perhaps--being men--with several fair faces, once so near and
dear, and now so far. How poignantly and unprofitably real memory can make them--all but bring
them back--how vividly reconstruct immortal occasions of happiness that we said could not,
must not, pass away; while all the time our hearts were aching with the sure knowledge that
they were even then, as we wildly clutched at them, slipping from our grasp!

That summer afternoon,--do you too still remember it, Miranda?--when, under the whispering
woodland, we ate our lunch together with such prodigious appetite, and O! such happy laughter,
yet never took our eyes from each other; and, when the meal was ended, how we wandered along
the stream-side down the rocky glen, till we came to an enchanted pool among the boulders,
all hushed with moss and ferns and overhanging boughs--do you remember what happened then,
Miranda? Ah! nymphs of the forest pools, it is no use asking me to forget.

And, all the time, my heart was saying to my eyes:--"This fairy hour--so real, so magical,
now--some day will be in the far past; you will sit right away on the lonely outside of it,
and recall it only with the anguish of beautiful vanished things." And here I am today surely
enough, years away from it, solitary on its lonely outside!

I suppose that the river, this summer day, is making the same music along its rocky bed, and
the leafy boughs are rustling over that haunted pool just the same as when--but where are the
laughing ripples--ah! Miranda--that broke with laughter over the divinely troubled water, and
the broken reflections, as of startled water-lilies, that rocked to and fro in a panic of dazzling
alabaster?

They are with last year's snow.

Meriel of the solemn eyes, with the heart and the laughter of a child, and soul like the starlit
sky, where should one look for the snows of yester-year if not in your bosom, fairy girl my
eyes shall never see again. Wherever you are, lost to me somewhere among the winding paths
of this strange wood of the world, do you ever, as the moonlight falls over the sea, give a
thought to that night when we sat together by a window overlooking the ocean, veiled in a haze
of moonlit pearl, and, dimly seen near shore, a boat was floating, like some mystic barge,
as we said, in our happy childishness, waiting to take us to the Land East of the Sun and West
of the Moon? Ah! how was it we lingered and lingered till the boat was no more there, and it
was too late? Perhaps it was that we seemed to be already there, as you turned and placed your
hand in mine and said: "My life is in your hand." And we both believed it true. Yes! wherever
we went together in those days, we were always in that enchanted land--whether we rode side
by side through London streets in a hansom--"a two-wheeled heaven" we called it--(for our dream
stretches as far back as that prehistoric day--How old one of us seems to be growing! You,
dear face, can never grow old)--or sat and laughed at clowns in London music halls, or wandered
in Surrey lanes, or gazed at each other, as if our hearts would break for joy, over the snow-white
napery of some country inn, and maybe quoted Omar to each other, as we drank his red wine to
the immortality of our love. Perhaps we were right, after all. Perhaps it could never die,
and Time and Distance are perhaps merely illusions, and you and I have never been apart. Who
knows but that you are looking over my shoulder as I write, though you seem so far away, lost
in that starlit silence that you loved. Ah! Meriel, is it well with you, this summer day? A
sigh seems to pass through the sunlit grasses. They are waving and whispering as I have seen
them waving and whispering over graves.

Such moments as these I have recalled all men have had in their lives, moments when life seemed
to have come to miraculous flower, attained that perfect fulfilment of its promise which else
we find only in dreams. Beyond doubt there is something in the flawless blessedness of such
moments that links our mortality with super-terrestrial states of being. We do, in very deed,
gaze through invisible doors into the ether of eternal existences, and, for the brief hour,
live as they, drinking deep of that music of the infinite which is the divine food of the enfranchised
soul. Thence comes our exaltation, and our wild longing to hold the moment for ever; for, while
it is with us, we have literally escaped from the everyday earth, and have found the way into
some other dimension of being, and its passing means our sad return to the prison-house of
Time, the place of meetings and partings, of distance and death.

Part of the pang of recalling such moments is a remorseful sense that perhaps we might have
held them fast, after all. If only we might bring them back, surely we would find some way
to dwell in them for ever. They came upon us so suddenly out of heaven, like some dazzling
bird, and we were so bewildered with the wonder of their coming that we stretched out our hands
to seize them, only when they were already spreading their wings for flight. But O if the divine
bird would but visit us again! What golden nets we would spread for him! What a golden cage
of worship we would make ready! Our eyes would never leave his strange plumage, nor would we
miss one note of his strange song. But alas! now that we are grown wise and watchful, that
"moment eternal" comes to us no more. Perhaps too that sad wisdom which has come to us with
the years would least of all avail us, should such moments by some magic chance suddenly return.
For it is one of the dangers of the retrospective habit that it incapacitates us for the realization
of the present hour. Much dwelling on last year's snow will make us forget the summer flowers.
Dreaming of fair faces that are gone, we will look with unseeing eyes into the fair faces that
companion us still. To the Spring we say: "What of all your blossom, and all your singing!
Autumn is already at your heels, like a shadow; and Winter waits for you like a marble tomb."
To the hope that still may beckon we say: "Well, what though you be fulfilled, you will pass,
like the rest. I shall see you come. We shall dwell together for a while, and then you will
go; and all will be as it was before, all as if you had never come at all." For the retrospective
mood, of necessity, begets the anticipatory; we see everything finished before it is begun,
and welcome and valediction blend together on our lips. "That which hath been is now; and that
which is to be hath already been."

                            In every kiss sealed fast
          To feel the first kiss and forebode the last--

that is the shadow that haunts every joy, and sicklies o'er every action of him whom life has
thus taught to look before and after.

Youth is not like that, and therein, for older eyes, lies its tragic pathos. Superficial--or,
if you prefer it, more normal--observers are made happy by the spectacle of eager and confident
young lives, all abloom and adream, turning towards the future with plumed impatient feet.
But for some of us there is nothing quite so sad as young joy. The playing of children is perhaps
the most unbearably sad thing in the world. Who can look on young lovers, without tears in
their eyes? With what innocent faith they are taking in all the radiant lies of life! But perhaps
a young mother with her new-born babe on her breast is the most tragical of all pictures of
unsuspecting joy, for none of all the trusting sons and daughters of men is destined in the
end to find herself so tragically, one might say cynically, fooled.

Cynically, I said; for indeed sometimes, as one ponders the lavish heartless use life seems
to make of all its divinely precious material--were it but the flowers in one meadow, or the
butterflies of a single summer day--it does seem as though a cruel cynicism inhered somewhere
in the scheme of things, delighting to destroy and disillusionize, to create loveliness in
order to scatter it to the winds, and inspire joy in order to mock it with desolation. Sometimes
it seems as though the mysterious spirit of life was hardly worthy of the vessels it has called
into being, hardly treats them fairly, uses them with an ignoble disdain. For, how generously
we give ourselves up to life, how innocently we put our trust in it, do its bidding with such
fine ardours, striving after beauty and goodness, fain to be heroic and clean of heart--yet
"what hath man of all his labours, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured
under the sun." Yea, dust, and fallen rose-leaves, and last year's snow.

And yet and yet, for all this drift and dishonoured decay of things, that retrospective mood
of ours will sometimes take another turn, and, so rare and precious in the memory seem the
treasure that it has lost, and yet in imagination still holds, that it will not resign itself
to mortal thoughts of such manifest immortalities. The snows of yester-year! Who knows if,
after all, they have so utterly vanished as they seem. Who can say but that there may be somewhere
in the universe secret treasuries where all that has ever been precious is precious still,
safely garnered and guarded for us against some wonderful moment which shall gather up for
us in one transfiguring apocalypse all the wonderful moments that have but preceded us into
eternity. Perhaps, as nothing is lost in the world, so-called, of matter, nothing is lost too
in the world of love and dream.

          O vanished loveliness of flowers and faces,
          Treasure of hair, and great immortal eyes,
          Are there for these no safe and secret places?
          And is it true that beauty never dies?
          Soldiers and saints, haughty and lovely names,
          Women who set the whole wide world in flames,
          Poets who sang their passion to the skies,
          And lovers wild and wise:
          Fought they and prayed for some poor flitting gleam
          Was all they loved and worshipped but a dream?
          Is Love a lie and fame indeed a breath?
          And is there no sure thing in life--but death?

Ah! perhaps we shall find all such lost and lovely things when we come at length to the Land
of Last Year's Snow.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GOSSIP

According to the old Scandinavian fable of the cosmos, the whole world is encircled in the
coils of a vast serpent. The ancient name for it was the Midgard serpent, and doubtless, for
the old myth-maker, it had another significance. Today, however, the symbol may still hold
good of a certain terrible and hideous reality.

Still, as of old, the world is encircled in the coils of a vast serpent; and the name of the
serpent is Gossip. Novelist, Copperfield. Modern.

The mystery of gossip is bound up with the mysterious human need of talking. Talk we must,
though we say nothing, or talk evil from sheer lack of subject-matter. When we know why man
talks so much, apparently for the mere sake of talking, we shall probably be nearer to knowing
why he prefers to speak and hear evil rather than good of his fellows.

Possibly the gossip would be just as ready to speak well of his victims, to circulate stories
to their credit rather than the reverse, but for the melancholy fact that he would thus be
left without an audience. For the world has no anxiety to hear good of its neighbour, and there
is no piquancy in the disclosure of hidden virtues. At least it presupposes individuality;
and, all things considered, it may be held as true that those most gossiped about are usually
those who can best afford to pay this tax levied by society on any form of distinction.

After all, the great and good man has his greatness and goodness to support him, though the
world should unite in depreciating him. The artist has his genius, the beautiful woman has
her beauty. 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus and thus; and if fame must have gossip for its
seamy side, there are some satisfactions that cannot be stolen away, and some laurels that
defy the worm.

XI

THE PASSING AWAY OF THE EDITOR

The word "editor" as applied to the conductors of magazines and newspapers is rapidly becoming
a mere courtesy title; for the powers and functions formerly exercised by editors, properly
so called, are being more and more usurped by the capitalist proprietor. There are not a few
magazines where the "editor" has hardly more say in the acceptance of a manuscript than the
contributor who sends it in. Few are the editors left who uphold the magisterial dignity and
awe with which the name of editor was wont to be invested. These survive owing chiefly to the
prestige of long service, and even they are not always free from the encroachments of the new
method. The proprietor still feels the irksome necessity of treating their editorial policies
with respect, though secretly chafing for the moment when they shall give place to more manageable,
modern tools.

The "new" editor, in fact, is little more than a clerk doing the bidding of his proprietor,
and the proprietor's idea of editing is slavishly to truckle to the public taste--or rather
to his crude conception of the public taste. The only real editors of today are the capitalist
and the public. The nominal editor is merely an office-boy of larger growth, and slightly larger
salary.

Innocent souls still, of course, imagine him clothed with divine powers, and letters of introduction
to him are still sought after by the superstitious beginner. Alas! the chances are that the
better he thinks of your MS. the less likely is it to be accepted by--the proprietor; for Mr.
Snooks, the proprietor, has decided tastes of his own, and a peculiar distaste for anything
remotely savouring of the "literary." His broad editorial axiom is that a popular magazine
should be everything and anything but--"literature." For any signs of the literary taint he
keeps open a stern and ever-watchful eye, and the "editor" or "editorial assistant"--to make
a distinction without a difference--whom he should suspect of literary leanings has but a short
shrift. Mr. Snooks is seldom much of a reader himself. His activities have been exclusively
financial, and he has drifted into the magazine business as he might have drifted into pork
or theatres--from purely financial reasons. His literary needs are bounded on the north by
a detective story, and on the south by a scientific article. The old masters of literature
are as much foolishness to him as the old masters of painting. In short, he is just a common,
ignorant man with money invested in a magazine; and who shall blame him if he goes on the principle
that he who pays the piper calls the tune. When he starts in he not infrequently begins by
entrusting his magazine to some young man with real editorial ability and ambition to make
a really good thing. This young man gathers about him a group of kindred spirits, and the result
is that after the publication of the second number Mr. Snooks decides to edit the magazine
himself, with the aid of a secretary and a few typewriters. His bright young men hadn't understood
"what the public wants" at all. They were too high-toned, too "literary." What the public wants
is short stories and pictures of actresses; and the short stories, like the actresses, must
be no better than they should be. Even short stories when they are masterpieces are not "what
the public wants." So the bright young men go into outer darkness, sadly looking for new jobs,
and with its third number Snooks's Monthly has fallen into line with the indistinguishable
ruck of monthly magazines, only indeed distinguishable one from the other by the euphonious
names of their proprietors.

Now, a proprietor's right to have his property managed according to his own ideas needs no
emphasizing. The sad thing is that such proprietors should get hold of such property. It all
comes, of course, of the modern vulgarization of wealth. Time was when even mere wealth was
aristocratic, and its possession, more or less implied in its possessors the possession, too,
of refinement and culture. The rich men of the past knew enough to encourage and support the
finer arts of life, and were interested in maintaining high standards of public taste and feeling.
Thus they were capable of sparing some of their wealth for investment in objects which brought
them a finer kind of reward than the financial. Among other things, they understood and respected
the dignity of literature, and would not have expected an editor to run a literary venture
in the interests of the illiterate. The further degradation of the public taste was not then
the avowed object of popular magazines. Indeed--strange as it sounds nowadays--it was rather
the education than the degradation of the public taste at which the editor aimed, and in that
aim he found the support of intelligent proprietors.

Today, however, all this is changed. Wealth has become democratic, and it is only here and
there, in its traditional possessors, that it retains its traditional aristocracy of taste.
As the commonest man can be a multi-millionaire, so the commonest man can own a magazine, and
have it edited in the commonest fashion for the common good.

As a result, the editor's occupation, in the true sense, will soon be gone. There is, need
one say, no lack today of men with real editorial individuality--but editorial individuality
is the last thing the capitalist proprietors want. It is just that they are determined to stamp
out. Therefore, your real editor must either swallow his pride and submit to ignorant dictation,
or make way for the little band of automatic sorters of manuscript, which, as nine tailors
make a man, nowadays constitute a sort of composite editor under the direction of the proprietor.

With the elimination of editorial individuality necessarily follows elimination of individuality
in the magazine. More and more, every day, magazines are conforming to the same monotonous
type; so that, except for name and cover, it is impossible to tell one magazine from another.
Happily one or two--rari nantes in gurgito vasto--survive amid the democratic welter; and all
who have at heart not only the interests of literature, but the true interests of the public
taste, will pray that they will have the courage to maintain their distinction, unseduced by
the moneyed voice of the mob--a distinction to which, after all, they have owed, and will continue
to owe, their success. The names of these magazines will readily occur to the reader, and,
as they occur, he cannot but reflect that it was just editorial individuality and a high standard
of policy that made them what they are, and what, it is ardently to be hoped, they will still
continue to be. Plutus and Demos are the worst possible editors for a magazine; and in the
end, even, it is the best magazine that always makes the most money.

And I go on thinking to this effect: that this impulse that has come to so many of us, and
has, incidentally, wrought such a harmony in our lives, is something more than duck-shooting,
trout-fishing, butterfly-collecting, or a sentimental passion for sunsets, but is indeed something
not so very far removed from religion, romantic religion. At all events, it is something that
makes us happy, and keeps us straight. That combination of results can only come by the satisfaction
of the undeniable religious instinct in all of us: an instinct that seeks goodness, but seeks
happiness too. Now, there are creeds by which you can be good without being happy; and creeds
by which you can be happy without being good. But, perhaps, there is only one creed by which
you can be both at once--the creed of the growing grass, and the blue sky and the running river,
the creed of the dog-wood and the skunk-cabbage, the creed of the red-wing and the blue heron--the
creed of the great god Pan.

Pan, being one of the oldest of the gods, might well, in an age eager for novelty, expect to
be the latest fashion; but the revival of his worship is something far more than a mere vogue.
It was rumoured, as, of course, we all know, early in the Christian era, that he was dead.
The pilot Thomas, ran the legend, as told by Plutarch, sailing near Pascos, with a boatful
of merchants, heard in the twilight a mighty voice calling from the land, bidding him proclaim
to all the world that Pan was dead. "Pan is dead!"--three times ran the strange shuddering
cry through the darkness, as though the very earth itself wailed the passing of the god.

But Pan, of course, could only die with the earth itself, and so long as the lichen and the
moss keep quietly at their work on the grey boulder, and the lightning zigzags down through
the hemlocks, and the arrowhead guards its waxen blossom in the streams; so long as the earth
shakes with the thunder of hoofs, or pours out its heart in the song of the veery-thrush, or
bares its bosom in the wild rose, so long will there be little chapels to Pan in the woodland--chapels
on the lintels of which you shall read, as Virgil wrote: Happy is he who knows the rural gods,
Pan, and old Sylvanus, and the sister nymphs.

It is strange to see how in every country, but more particularly in America and in England,
the modern man is finding his religion as it was found by those first worshippers of the beautiful
mystery of the visible universe, those who first caught glimpses of

          Nymphs in the coppice, Naiads in the fountain,
          Gods on the craggy height and roaring sea.

First thoughts are proverbially the best; at all events, they are the bravest. And man's first
thoughts of the world and the strangely romantic life he is suddenly called up, out of nothingness,
to live, unconsulted, uninstructed, left to feel his way in the blinding radiance up into which
he has been mysteriously thrust; those first thoughts of his are nowadays being corroborated
in every direction by the last thoughts of the latest thinker. Mr. Jack London, one of Nature's
own writers, one of those writers too, through whom the Future speaks, has given a name to
this stirring of the human soul--"The Call of the Wild." Following his lead, others have written
of "The Lure," of this and that in nature, and all mean the same thing: that the salvation
of man is to be found on, and by means of, the green earth out of which he was born, and that,
as there is no ill of his body which may not be healed by the magic juices of herb and flower,
or the stern potency of minerals, so there is no sickness of his soul that may not be cured
by the sound of the sea, the rustle of leaves, or the songs of birds.

Thirty or forty years ago the soul of the world was very sick. It had lost religion in a night
of misunderstood "materialism," so-called. But since then that mere "matter" which seemed to
eclipse the soul has grown strangely radiant to deep-seeing eyes, and, whereas then one had
to doubt everything, dupes of superficial disillusionment, now there is no old dream that has
not the look of coming true, no hope too wild and strange and beautiful to be confidently entertained.
Even, if you wish to believe in fairies, science will hardly say you nay. Those dryads and
fauns, which Keats saw "frightened away" by the prosaic times in which it was his misfortune
to be alive and unrecognized, are trooping back in every American woodland, and the god whose
name I have invoked has become more than ever

                                 the leaven
          That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
          Gives it a touch ethereal.

His worship is all the more sincere because it is not self-conscious. If you were to tell the
trout-fisher, or the duck-shooter, or the camper-out, that he is a worshipper of Pan, he would
look at you in a kindly bewilderment. He would seem a little anxious about you, but it would
be only a verbal misunderstanding. It would not take him long to realize that you were only
putting in terms of a creed the intuitive and inarticulate faith of his heart. Perhaps the
most convincing sign of this new-old faith in nature is the unconsciousness of the believer.
He has no idea that he is believing or having faith in anything. He is simply loving the green
earth and the blue sea, and the ways of birds and fish and animals; but he is so happy in his
innocent, ignorant joy that he seems almost to shine with his happiness. There is, literally,
a light about him--that light which edges with brightness all sincere action. The trout, or
the wild duck, or the sea bass is only an innocent excuse to be alone with the Infinite. To
be alone. To be afar. Men sail precarious craft in perilous waters for no reason they could
tell of. They may think that trawling, or dredging, or whaling is the explanation: the real
reason is the mystery we call the Sea.

Ostensibly, of course, the angler is a man who goes out to catch fish; yet there is a great
difference between an angler and a fishmonger. Though the angler catches no fish, though his
creel be empty as he returns home at evening, there is a curious happiness and peace about
him which a mere fishmonger would be at a loss to explain. Fish, as I said, were merely an
excuse; and, as he vainly waited for fish, without knowing it, he was learning the rhythm of
the stream, and the silence of ferns was entering into his soul, and the calm and patience
of meadows were dreamily becoming a part of him. Suddenly, too, in the silence, maybe he caught
sight of a strange, hairy, masterful presence, sitting by the stream, whittling reeds, and
blowing his breath into them here and there, and finally binding them together with rushes,
till he had made out of the empty reeds and rushes an instrument that sang everything that
can be sung and told you everything that can be told.

Do you really think that the huntsman hunts only the deer? He, himself, doubtless thinks that
the trophy of the antlers was all he went out into the woods to win. But there came a day to
him when he missed the deer, and caught a glimpse instead of the divine huntress, Diana, high-buskined,
short-kirtled, speeding with her hounds through the lonely woodland, and his thoughts ran no
more on venison for that day.

The same truth is true of all men who go out into the green, blue-eyed wilderness, whether
they go there in pursuit of game or butterflies. They find something stranger and better than
what they went out to seek, and, if they come home disappointed in the day's bag or catch,
there is yet something in their eyes, and across their brows, a light of peace, an enchanted
calm, which tells those who understand that they, at all events, have seen the great god Pan,
and heard the music he can make out of the pipy hemlocks or the lonely pines.

XIII

AN OLD AMERICAN TOW-PATH

The charm of an old canal is one which every one seems to feel. Men who care nothing about
ruined castles or Gothic cathedrals light up with romantic enthusiasm if you tell them of some
old disused or seldom-used canal, grass-grown and tree-shaded, along which, hardly oftener
than once a week, a leisurely barge--towed by an equally leisurely mule, with its fellow there
on deck taking his rest, preparatory to his next eight-mile "shift"--sleepily dreams its way,
presumably on some errand and to some destination, yet indeed hinting of no purpose or object
other than its loitering passage through a summer afternoon. I have even heard millionaires
express envy of the life lived by the little family hanging out its washing and smoking its
pipe and cultivating its floating garden of nasturtiums and geraniums, with children playing
and a house-dog to keep guard, all in that toy house of a dozen or so feet, whose foundations
are played about by fishes, and whose sides are brushed by whispering reeds. But the charm
of an old canal is perhaps yet more its own when even so tranquil a happening as the passage
of a barge is no longer looked for, and the quiet water is called upon for no more arduous
usefulness than the reflection of the willows or the ferrying across of summer clouds. Nature
herself seems to wield a new peculiar spell in such association--old quarries, the rusting
tramways choked with fern; forgotten mines with the wild vine twining tenderly about the old
iron of dismantled pit-tackle, grown as green as itself with the summer rains; roads once dusty
with haste over which only the moss and the trailing arbutus now leisurely travel. Wherever
Nature is thus seen to be taking to herself, making her own, what man has first made and grown
tired of, she is twice an enchantress, strangely combining in one charm the magic of a wistful,
all but forgotten, past with her own sibyl-line mystery.

The symbol of that combined charm is that poppy of oblivion of which Sir Thomas Browne so movingly
wrote: but, though along that old canal of which I am thinking and by which I walked a summer
day, no poppies were growing, the freshest grass, the bluest flowers, the new-born rustling
leafage of the innumerable trees, all alike seemed to whisper of forgetfulness, to be brooding,
even thus in the very heyday of the mad young year, over time past. And this eloquently retrospective
air of Nature made me realize, with something of the sense of discovery, how much of what we
call antiquity is really a trick of Nature. She is as clever at the manufacture of antiques
as some expert of "old masters." A little moss here and there, a network of ivy, a judicious
use of ferns and grass, a careless display of weeds and wild flowers, and in twenty years Nature
can make a modern building look as if it dated from the Norman Conquest. I came upon this reflection
because, actually, my canal is not very old, though from the way it impressed me, and from
the manner in which I have introduced it, the reader might well imagine it as old as Venice
and no younger than Holland, and may find it as hard to believe as I did that its age is but
some eighty years, and that it has its romantic being between Newark Bay and Phillipsburg,
on the Delaware River.

One has always to be careful not to give too much importance to one's own associative fancies
in regard to the names of places. To me, for instance, "Perth Amboy" has always had a romantic
sound, and I believe that a certain majesty in the collocation of the two noble words would
survive that visit to the place itself which I have been told is all that is necessary for
disillusionment. On the other hand, for reasons less explainable, Hackensack, Paterson, Newark,
and even Passaic are names that had touched me with no such romantic thrill. Wrongfully, no
doubt, I had associated them with absurdity, anarchy, and railroads. Never having visited them,
it was perhaps not surprising that I should not have associated them with such loveliness and
luxury of Nature as I now unforgettably recall; and I cannot help feeling that in the case
of places thus unfortunately named, Nature might well bring an action for damages, robbed as
she thus undoubtedly is of a flock of worshippers.

At all events, I believe that my surprise and even incredulity will be understood when an artist
friend of mine told me that by taking the Fort Lee ferry, and trolleying from the Palisades
through Hackensack to Paterson, I might find--a dream canal. It was as though he had said that
I had but to cross over to Hoboken to find the Well at the World's End. But it was true, for
all that--quite fairy-tale true. It was one of those surprises of peace, deep, ancient peace,
in America, of which there are many, and of which more needs to be told. I can conceive of
no more suggestive and piquant contrast than that of the old canal gliding through water-lilies
and spreading pastures, in the bosom of hills clothed with trees that scatter the sunshine
or gather the darkness, the haunt of every bird that sings or flashes strange plumage and is
gone, gliding past flowering rushes and blue dragon-flies, not

          Flowing down to Camelot,

as one might well believe, but between Newark and Phillipsburg, touching Paterson midway with
its dreaming hand.

Following my friend's directions, we had met at Paterson, and, desirous of finding our green
pasture and still waters with the least possible delay, we took a trolley running in the Newark
direction, and were presently dropped at a quaint, quiet little village called Little Falls,
the last we were to see of the modern work-a-day world for several miles. A hundred yards or
so beyond, and it is as though you had entered some secret green door into a pastoral dream-land.
Great trees, like rustling walls of verdure, enclose an apparently endless roadway of gleaming
water, a narrow strip of tow-path keeping it company, buttressed in from the surrounding fields
with thickets of every species of bush and luxurious undergrowth, and starred with every summer
flower.

Presently, by the side of the path, one comes to an object which seems romantically in keeping
with the general character of the scene--a long block of stone, lying among the grasses and
the wild geraniums, on which, as one nears it, one descries carved scroll-work and quaint,
deep-cut lettering. Is it the tomb of dead lovers, the memorial of some great deed, or an altar
to the genius loci? The willows whisper about it, and the great elms and maples sway and murmur
no less impressively than if the inscription were in Latin of two thousand years ago. Nor is
it in me to regret that the stone and its inscription, instead of celebrating the rural Pan,
commemorate the men to whom I owe this lane of dreaming water and all its marginal green solitude:
to wit--the "MORRIS CANAL AND BANKING CO., A.D. 1829," represented by its president, its cashier,
its canal commissioner, and a score of other names of directors, engineers, and builders. Peace,
therefore, to the souls of those dead directors, who, having only in mind their banking and
engineering project, yet unconsciously wrought, nearly a century ago, so poetic a thing, and
may their rest be lulled by such leafy murmurs and swaying of tendrilled shadows as all the
day through stir and sway along the old canal!

A few yards beyond this monumental stone, there comes a great opening in the sky, a sense of
depth and height and spacious freshness in the air, such as we feel on approaching the gorge
of a great river; and in fact the canal has arrived at the Passaic and is about to be carried
across it in a sort of long, wooden trough, supported by a noble bridge that might well pass
for a genuine antique, owing to that collaborating hand of Nature which has filled the interstices
of its massive masonry with fern, and so loosened it here and there that some of the canal
escapes in long, ribbon-like cascades into the rocky bed of the river below. An aqueduct has
always seemed to me, though it would be hard to say why, a most romantic thing. The idea of
carrying running water across a bridge in this way--water which it is so hard to think of as
imprisoned or controlled, and which, too, however shallow, one always associates with mysterious
depth--the idea of thus carrying it across a valley high up in the air, so that one may look
underneath it, underneath the bed in which it runs, and think of the fishes and the water-weeds
and the waterbugs all being carried across with it, too--this, I confess, has always seemed
to me engagingly marvellous. And I like, too, to think that the canal, whose daily business
is to be a "common carrier" of others, thus occasionally tastes the luxury of being carried
itself; as sometimes one sees on a freight car a new buggy, or automobile, or sometimes a locomotive,
being luxuriously ridden along--as though out for a holiday--instead of riding others.

And talking of freight-cars, it came to me with a sense of illumination how different the word
"Passaic" looks printed in white letters on the grey sides of grim produce-vans in begrimed
procession, from the way it looks as it writes its name in wonderful white waterfalls, or murmurs
it through corridors of that strange pillared and cake-shaped rock, amid the golden pomp of
a perfect summer day. For a short distance the Passaic and the canal run side by side, but
presently they part company, and mile after mile the canal seems to have the world to itself,
once in a great while finding human companionship in a shingled cottage half hidden among willows,
a sleepy brick-field run on principles as ancient as itself, shy little girls picking flowers
on its banks, or saucy boys disporting themselves in the old swimming-hole; and

          Sometimes an angler comes and drops his hook
          Within its hidden depths, and 'gainst a tree
          Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,
          Forgetting soon his pride of fishery;
            And dreams or falls asleep,
            While curious fishes peep
          About his nibbled bait or scornfully
            Dart off and rise and leap.

Once a year, indeed, every one goes a-fishing along the old canal--men, women, boys, and girls.
That is in spring, when the canal is emptied for repairs, the patching up of leaks, and so
forth. Then the fish lie glittering in the shallow pools, as good as caught, and happy children
go home with strings of sunfish,--"pumpkin-seeds" they call them,--cat-fish, and the like picturesque
unprofitable spoils, while graver fisher-folk take count of pickerel and bream. This merry
festival was over and gone, and the canal was all brimming with the lustral renewal of its
waters, its depths flashing now and again with the passage of wary survivors of that spring battue.

It is essential to the appreciation of an old canal that one should not expect it to provide
excitement, that it be understood between it and its fellow-pilgrim that there is very little
to say and nothing to record. Along the old tow-path you must be content with a few simple,
elemental, mysterious things. To enter into its spirit you must be somewhat of a monastic turn
of mind, and have spiritual affiliations, above all, with La Trappe. For the presiding muse
of an old canal is Silence; yet, as at La Trappe, a silence far indeed from being a dumb silence,
but a silence that contains all speech. My friend and I spoke hardly at all as we walked along,
easily obedient to the spirit of the hour and the place. For there were so few of those little
gossipy accidents and occurrences by the way that make those interruptions we call conversation,
and such overwhelming golden-handed presences of sunlit woodlands, flashing water-meadows,
shining, singing air, and distant purple hills--all the blowing, rippling, leafy glory and
mighty laughter of a summer day--that we were glad enough to let the birds do such talking
as Nature deemed necessary; and I seem never to have heard or seen so many birds, of so many
varieties, as haunt that old canal.

As we chose our momentary camping-place under a buttonwood-tree, from out an exuberant swamp
of yellow water-lilies and the rearing sword-blades of the coming cat-tail, a swamp blackbird,
on his glossy black orange-tipped wings, flung us defiance with his long, keen, full, saucy
note; and as we sat down under our buttonwood and spread upon the sward our pastoral meal,
the veery-thrush--sadder and stranger than any nightingale--played for us, unseen, on an instrument
like those old water-organs played on by the flow and ebb of the tide, a flute of silver in
which some strange magician has somewhere hidden tears.

But when the veery had flown with his heart-break to some distant copse, two song-sparrows
came to persuade us with their blithe melody that life was worth living, after all; and cheerful
little domestic birds, like the jenny-wren and the chipping-sparrow, pecked about and put in
between whiles their little chit-chat across the boughs, while the bobolink called to us like
a comrade, and the phoebe-bird gave us a series of imitations, and the scarlet tanager and
the wild canary put in a vivid appearance, to show what can be done with colour, though they
have no song.

Yet, while one was grateful for such long, green silence as we found along that old canal,
one could not help feeling how hard it would be to put into words an experience so infinite
and yet so undramatic. Birds and birds, and trees and trees, and the long, silent water! Prose
has seldom been adequate for such moments. So, as my friend and I took up our walk again, I
sang him this little song of the Silence of the Way:

          Silence, whose drowsy eyelids are soft leaves,
            And whose half-sleeping eyes are the blue flowers,
          On whose still breast the water-lily heaves,
            And all her speech the whisper of the showers.

          Made of all things that in the water sway,
            The quiet reed kissing the arrowhead,
          The willows murmuring, all a summer day,
            "Silence"--sweet word, and ne'er so softly said

          As here along this path of brooding peace,
            Where all things dream, and nothing else is done
          But all such gentle businesses as these
            Of leaves and rippling wind, and setting sun

          Turning the stream to a long lane of gold,
            Where the young moon shall walk with feet of pearl,
          And, framed in sleeping lilies, fold on fold.
            Gaze at herself like any mortal girl.

But, after all, trees are perhaps the best expression of silence, massed as they are with the
merest hint of movement, and breathing the merest suggestion of a sigh; and seldom have I seen
such abundance and variety of trees as along our old canal--cedars and hemlocks and hickory
dominating green slopes of rocky pasture, with here and there a clump of silver birches bent
over with the strain of last year's snow; and all along, near by the water, beech and basswood,
blue-gum and pin-oak, ash, and even chestnut flourishing still, in defiance of blight. Nor
have I ever seen such sheets of water-lilies as starred the swampy thickets, in which elder
and hazels and every conceivable bush and shrub and giant grass and cane make wildernesses
pathless indeed save to the mink and the water-snake, and the imagination that would fain explore
their glimmering recesses.

No, nothing except birds and trees, water-lilies and such like happenings, ever happens along
the old canal; and our nearest to a human event was our meeting with a lonely, melancholy man,
sitting near a moss-grown water-wheel, smoking a corn-cob pipe, and gazing wistfully across
at the Ramapo Hills, over which great sunlit clouds were billowing and casting slow-moving
shadows. Stopping, we passed him the time of day and inquired when the next barge was due.
For answer he took a long draw at his corn-cob, and, taking his eyes for a moment from the
landscape, said in a far-away manner that it might be due any time now, as the spring had come
and gone, and implying, with a sort of sad humour in his eyes, that spring makes all things
possible, brings all things back, even an old slow-moving barge along the old canal.

"What do they carry on the canal?" I asked the melancholy man, the romantic green hush and
the gleaming water not irrelevantly flashing on my fancy that far-away immortal picture of
the lily-maid of Astolat on her strange journey, with a letter in her hand for Lancelot.

"Coal," was his answer; and, again drawing at his corn-cob, he added, with a sad and understanding
smile, "once in a great while." Like most melancholy men, he seemed to have brains, in his
way, and to have no particular work on hand, except, like ourselves, to dream.

"Suppose," said I, "that a barge should come along, and need to be drawn up this 'plane'--would
the old machinery work?" and I pointed to six hundred feet of sloping grass, down which a tramway
stretches and a cable runs on little wheels--technically known, it appeared, as a "plane."

Then the honour of the ancient company for which he had once worked seemed to stir his blood,
and he awakened to something like enthusiasm as he explained the antique, picturesque device
by which it is still really possible for a barge to climb six hundred feet of grass and fern--drawn
up in a long "cradle," instead of being raised by locks in the customary way.

Then he took us into the old building where, in the mossed and dripping darkness, we could
discern the great water-wheels that work this fascinating piece of ancient engineering; and
added that there would probably be a barge coming along in three or four days, if we should
happen to be in the neighbourhood. He might have added that the old canal is one of the few
places where "time and tide" wait for any one and everybody--but alas! on this occasion we
could not wait for them.

Our walk was nearing its end when we came upon a pathetic reminder that, though the old canal
is so far from being a stormy sea, there have been wrecks even in those quiet waters. In a
backwater whispered over by willows and sung over by birds, a sort of water-side graveyard,
eleven old barges were ingloriously rotting, unwept and unhonoured. The hulks of old men-of-war,
forgotten as they may seem, have still their annual days of bunting and the salutes of cannon;
but to these old servitors of peace come no such memorial recognitions.

"Unwept and unhonoured, may be," said I to my friend, "but they shall not go all unsung, though
humble be the rhyme"; so here is the rhyme I affixed to an old nail on the mouldering side
of the Janita C. Williams:

          You who have done your work and asked no praise,
          Mouldering in these unhonoured waterways,
          Carrying but simple peace and quiet fire,
          Doing a small day's work for a small hire--
          You need not praise, nor guns, nor flags unfurled,
          Nor all such cloudy glories of the world;
          The laurel of a simple duty done
          Is the best laurel underneath the sun,
          Yet would two strangers passing by this spot
          Whisper, "Old boat--you are not all forgot!"

XIV

A MODERN SAINT FRANCIS

We were neither of us fox-hunting ourselves, but chanced both to be out on our morning walk
and to be crossing a breezy Surrey common at the same moment, when the huntsmen and huntresses
of the Slumberfold Hunt were blithely congregating for a day's run. A meet is always an attractive
sight, and we had both come to a halt within a yard or two of each other, and stood watching
the gallant company of fine ladies and gentlemen on their beautiful, impatient mounts, keeping
up a prancing conversation, till the exciting moment should arrive when the cry would go up
that the fox had been started, and the whole field would sweep away, a cataract of hounds,
red-coats, riding habits, and dog-carts.

The moment came. The fox had been found in a spinney running down to Withy Brook, and his race
for life had begun. With a happy shout, the hunt was up and off in a twinkling, and the stranger
and I were left alone on the broad common.

I had scanned him furtively as he stood near me; a tall, slightly build man of about fifty,
with perfectly white hair, and strangely gentle blue eyes. There was a curious, sad distinction
over him, and he had watched the scene with a smile of blended humour and pity.

Turning to me, as we were left alone, and speaking almost as though to himself: "It is a strange
sight," he said with a sigh. "I wonder if it seems as strange to you? Think of all those grown-up,
so-called civilized people being so ferociously intent on chasing one poor little animal for
its life--and feeling, when at last the huntsman holds up his poor brush, with absurd pride
(if indeed the fox is not too sly for them), that they have really done something clever, in
that with so many horses and dogs and so much noise, they have actually contrived to catch
and kill one fox!"

"It is strange!" I said, for I had been thinking just that very thing.

"Of course, they always tell you," he continued, as we took the road together, "that the fox
really enjoys being hunted, and that he feels his occupation gone if there are no hounds to
track him, and finally to tear him to pieces. What wonderful stories human nature will tell
itself in its own justification! Can one imagine any created thing enjoying being pursued for
its life, with all that loud terror of men and horses and savage dogs at its heels? No doubt--if
we can imagine even a fox so self-conscious--it would take a certain pride in its own cunning
and skill, if the whole thing were a game; but a race with death is too deadly in earnest for
a fox even to relish his own stratagems. Happily for the fox, it is probable that he does not
feel so much for himself as some of us feel for him; but any one who knows the wild things
knows too what terror they are capable of feeling, and how the fear of death is always with
them. No! you may be sure that a fox prefers a cosy hen-roost to the finest run with the hounds
ever made."

"But even if he should enjoy being hunted," I added, "the even stranger thing to me is that
civilized men and women should enjoy hunting him."

"Isn't it strange?" answered my companion eagerly, his face lighting up at finding a sympathizer.
"When will people realize that there is so much more fun in studying wild things than in killing
them!..."

He stopped suddenly in his walk, to gather a small weed which had caught his quick eye by the
roadside, and which he examined for a moment through a little pocket microscope which I noticed,
hanging like an eyeglass round his neck, and which I learned afterward quite affectionately
to associate with him. Then, as we walked on, he remarked:

"But, of course, we are yet very imperfectly civilized. Humanity is a lesson learned very slowly
by the human race. Yet we are learning it by degrees, yes! we are learning it," and he threw
out his long stride more emphatically--the stride of one accustomed to long daily tramps on
the hills.

"Strange, that principle of cruelty in the universe!" he resumed, after a pause in which he
had walked on in silence. "Very strange. To me it is the most mysterious of all things--though,
I suppose, after all, it is no more mysterious than pity. When, I wonder, did pity begin? Who
was the first human being to pity another? How strange he must have seemed to the others, how
incomprehensible and ridiculous--not to say dangerous! There can be little doubt that he was
promptly dispatched with stone axes as an enemy of a respectable murderous society."

"I expect," said I "that our friends the fox-hunters would take a similar view of our remarks
on their sport."

"No doubt--and perhaps turn their hounds on us! A man hunt! 'Give me the hunting of man!' as
a brutal young poet we know of recently sang."

"That is one of my mottoes!" cried my companion with evident pleasure. "Let us go and quote
it to our fox-hunters!"

"I wonder how the fox is getting on," I said.

"If he is any sort of fox, he is safe enough as yet, we may be sure. They are wonderful creatures.
It is not surprising that mankind has always looked upon Reynard as almost a human being--if
not more--for there is something quite uncanny in his instincts, and the cool, calculating
way in which he uses them. He is come and gone like a ghost. One moment you were sure you saw
him clearly close by and the next he is gone--who knows where? He can run almost as swiftly
as light, and as softly as a shadow; and in his wildest dash, what a sure judgment he has for
the lie of the ground, how unerringly--and at a moment when a mistake is death--he selects
his cover! How learned, too, he is in his knowledge of the countryside! There is not a dry
ditch, or a water-course, or an old drain, or a hole in a bank for miles around that is not
mysteriously set down in the map he carries in his graceful, clever head; and one need hardly
say that all the suitable hiding-places in and around farm-yards are equally well known to
him. Then withal he is so brave. How splendidly, when wearied out, and hopelessly tracked down,
with the game quite up, he will turn on his pursuers, and die with his teeth fast in his enemy's
throat!"

"I believe you are a fox-hunter in disguise," I laughed.

"Well, I have hunted as a boy," he said, "and I know something of what those red-coated gentlemen
are feeling. But soon I got more interested in studying nature than killing it, and when I
became a naturalist I ceased to be a hunter. You get to love the things so that it seems like
killing little children. They come so close to you, are so beautiful and so clever; and sometimes
there seems such a curious pathos about them. How any one can kill a deer with that woman's
look in its eyes, I don't know. I should always expect the deer to change into a fairy princess,
and die in my arms with the red blood running from her white breast. And pigeons, too, with
their soft sunny coo all the summer afternoon, or the sudden lapping of sleepy wings round
the chimneys--how can any one trap or shoot them with blood-curdling rapidity, and not expect
to see ghosts!"

"Of course, there is this difference about the fox," I said, "that it is really in a sense
born to be hunted. For not only is it a fierce hunter itself, but it would not be allowed to
exist at all, so to say, unless it consented to being hunted. Like a gladiator it accepts a
comfortable living for a certain time, on condition of its providing at last a spirited exhibition
of dying. In other words, it is preserved entirely for the purpose of being hunted. It must
accept life on that condition or be extirpated as destructive vermin by the plundered farmer.
Life is sweet, after all, and to be a kind of protected highwayman of the poultry-yard, for
a few sweet toothsome years, taking one's chances of being surely brought to book at last,
may perhaps seem worth while."

"Yes! but how does your image of the protected gladiator reflect on those who protect him?
There, of course, is the point. The gladiator, as you say, is willing to take his chances in
exchange for fat living and idleness, as long as he lives. You may even say that his profession
is good for him, develops fine qualities of mind even as well as body--but what of the people
who crowd with blood-thirsty eagerness to watch those qualities exhibited in so tragic a fashion
for their amusement? Do they gain any of his qualities of skill and courage, and strength and
fearlessness in the face of death? No, they are merely brutalized by cruel excitement--and
while they applaud his skill and admire his courage, they long most to watch him die. So--is
it not?--with our friend the fox. The huntsman invariably compliments him on his spirit and
his cunning, but what he wants is--the brush. He wants the excitement of hunting the living
thing to its death; and, let huntsmen say what they will about the exhilaration of the horse
exercise across country as being the main thing, they know better--and, if it be true, why
don't they take it without the fox?"

"They do in America, as, of course, you know. There a man walks across country trailing a stick,
at the end of which is a piece of cloth impregnated with some pungent scent which hounds love
and mistake for the real thing."

"Hard on the poor hounds!" smiled my friend. "Even worse than a red herring. You could hardly
blame the dogs if they mistook the man for Actaeon and tore him to pieces."

"And I suspect that the huntsmen are no better satisfied."

"Yet, as we were saying, if the secret spring of their sport is not the cruel delight of pursuing
a living thing to its death, that American plan should serve all the purposes, and give all
the satisfaction for which they claim to follow the hounds: the keen pleasure of a gallop across
country, the excitement of its danger, the pluck and pride of taking a bad fence, and equally,
too, the pleasure of watching the hounds cleverly at work with their mysterious gift of scent.
All the same, I suspect there are few sportsmen who would not vote it a tame substitute. Without
something being killed, the zest, the 'snap,' is gone. It is as depressing as a sham fight."

"Yes, that mysterious shedding of blood! what a part it has played in human history! Even religion
countenances it, and war glorifies it. Men are never in higher spirits than when they are going
to kill, or be killed themselves, or see something else killed. Tennyson's 'ape and tiger'
die very hard in the tamest of us."

"Alas, indeed they do!" said my friend with a sigh. "But I do believe that they are dying none
the less. Just of late there has been a reaction in favour of brute force, and people like
you and me have been ridiculed as old-fashioned sentimentalists. But reaction is one of the
laws of advance. Human progress always takes a step backwards after it has taken two forward.
And so it must be here too. In the end, it is the highest type among men and nations that count,
and the highest types among both today are those which show most humanity, shrink most from
the infliction of pain. When one thinks of the horrible cruelties that were the legal punishment
of criminals, even within the last two hundred years, and not merely brutal criminals, but
also political offenders or so-called heretics--how every one thought it the natural and proper
thing to break a man on the wheel for a difference of opinion, or torture him with hideous
ingenuity into a better frame of mind, and how the pettiest larcenies were punished by death;
it seems as if we of today, even the least sensitive of us, cannot belong to the same race--and
it is impossible to deny that the heart of the world has grown softer and that pity is becoming
more and more a natural instinct in human nature. I believe that some day it will have thrust
out cruelty altogether, and that the voluntary infliction of pain upon another will be unknown.
The idea of any one killing for pleasure will seem too preposterous to be believed, and soldiers
and fox-hunters and pigeon-shooters will be spoken of as nowadays we speak of cannibals. But,
of course, I am a dreamer," he concluded, his face shining with his gentle dream, as though
he had been a veritable saint of the calendar.

"Yes, a dream," he added presently, "and yet--"  In that "and yet" there was a world of invincible
faith that made it impossible not to share his dream, even see it building before one's eyes--such
is the magnetic power of a passionate personal conviction.

"Of course," he went on again, "we all know that 'nature is one with rapine, a harm no preacher
can heal.' But because the fox runs off with the goose, or the hawk swoops down on the chicken,
and 'yon whole little wood is a world of plunder and prey'--is that any reason why we should
be content to plunder and prey too? And after all, the cruelty of Nature is only one-sided.
There is lots of pity in Nature too. These strange little wild lives around us are not entirely
bent on killing and eating each other. They know the tenderness of motherhood, the sweetness
of building a home together, and I believe there is far more comradeship and mutual help amongst
them than we know of. Yes, even in wild Nature there is a principle of love working no less
than a principle of hate. Nature is not all-devouring and destroying. She is loving and building
too. Nature is more constructive than destructive, and she is ever at work evolving and evolving
a higher dream. Surely it is not for man, to whom, so far as we know, Nature has entrusted
the working out of her finest impulses, and whom she has endowed with all the fairy apparatus
of the soul; it is not for him, whose eyes--of all her children--Nature has opened, the one
child she has taken into her confidence and to whom she has whispered her secret hopes and
purposes; surely it is not for man voluntarily to deny his higher lot, and, because the wolf
and he have come from the same great mother, say: 'I am no better than the wolf. Why should
I not live the life of a wolf--and kill and devour like my brother?' Surely it is not for the
cruel things in Nature to teach man cruelty--rather, if it were possible," and the saint smiled
at his fancy, "would it be the mission of man to teach them kindness: rather should he preach
pity to the hawk and peace between the panther and the bear. It is not the bad lessons of Nature,
but the good, that are meant for man--though, as you must have noticed, man seldom appeals
to the precedents of Nature except to excuse that in him which is Nature at her worst. When
we say, 'it is only natural,' we almost invariably refer to that in Nature of which Nature
herself has entrusted the refinement or the elimination to man. It is Nature's bad we copy,
not Nature's good; and always we forget that we ourselves are a part of Nature--Nature's vicegerent,
so to say, upon the earth--"

As we talked, we had been approaching a house built high among the heather, with windows looking
over all the surrounding country. Presently, the saint stopped in front of it.

"This is my house," he said. "Won't you come in and see me some time?--and, by the way, I am
going to talk to some of the village children about the wild things, bird's nesting, and so
forth, up at the schoolhouse on Thursday. I wish you'd come and help me. One's only hope is
with the children. The grown-up are too far gone. Mind you come."

As I dipped into the little thick-set wood that surrounds my house, something stood for a second
in one of the openings, then was gone like a shadow. I was glad to think how full of bracken
and hollows, and mysterious holes and corners of mossed and lichened safety was our old wood--for
the shadow was a fox. I like to think it was the very fox we had been talking about come to
find shelter with me--and, if he stole a meal out of our hen-roost, I gave it him before he
asked it, with all the will in the world. I hope he chose a good fat hen, and not one of your
tough old capons that sometimes come to table.

XV

THE LITTLE GHOST IN THE GARDEN

I don't know in what corner of the garden his busy little life now takes its everlasting rest.
None of us had the courage to stand by, that summer morning, when Morris, our old negro man,
buried him, and we felt sympathetic for Morris that the sad job should fall upon him, for Morris
loved him just as we did. Perhaps if we had loved him less, more sentimentally than deeply,
we should have indulged in some sort of appropriate ceremonial, and marked his grave with a
little stone. But, as I have said, his grave, like that of the great prophet, is a secret to
this day. None of us has ever asked Morris about it, and his grief has been as reticent as
our own. I wondered the other night, as I walked the garden in a veiled moonlight, whether
it was near the lotus-tanks he was lying--for I remembered how he would stand there, almost
by the hour, watching the goldfish that we had engaged to protect us against mosquitoes, moving
mysteriously under the shadows of the great flat leaves. In his short life he grew to understand
much of this strange world, but he never got used to those goldfish; and often I have seen
him, after a long wistful contemplation of them, turn away with a sort of half-frightened,
puzzled bark, as though to say that he gave it up. Or, does he lie, I wonder, somewhere among
the long grass of the salt-marsh, that borders our garden, and in perigee tides widens out
into a lake. There indeed would be his appropriate country, for there was the happy hunting-ground
through which in life he was never tired of roaming, in the inextinguishable hope of mink,
and with the occasional certainty of a water-rat.

He had come to us almost as mysteriously as he went away; a fox-terrier puppy wandered out
of the Infinite to the neighbourhood of our ice-box, one November morning, and now wandered
back again. Technically, he was just graduating out of puppyhood, though, like the most charming
human beings, he never really grew up, and remained, in behaviour and imagination, a puppy
to the end. He was a dog of good breed and good manners, evidently with gentlemanly antecedents
canine and human. There were those more learned in canine aristocracy than ourselves who said
that his large leaf-like, but very becoming, ears meant a bar sinister somewhere in his pedigree,
but to our eyes those only made him better-looking; and, for the rest of him, he was race--race
nervous, sensitive, refined, and courageous--from the point of his all-searching nose to the
end of his stub of a tail, which the conventional docking had seemed but to make the more expressive.
We had already one dog in the family when he arrived, and two Maltese cats. With the cats he
was never able to make friends, in spite of persistent well-intentioned efforts. It was evident
to us that his advances were all made in the spirit of play, and from a desire of comradeship,
the two crowning needs of his blithe sociable spirit. But the cats received them in an attitude
of invincible distrust, of which his poor nose frequently bore the sorry signature. Yet they
had become friendly enough with the other dog, an elderly setter, by name Teddy, whose calm,
lordly, slow-moving ways were due to a combination of natural dignity, vast experience of life,
and some rheumatism. As Teddy would sit philosophizing by the hearth of an evening, immovable
and plunged in memories, yet alert on the instant to a footfall a quarter of a mile away, they
would rub their sinuous smoke-grey bodies to and fro beneath his jaws, just as though he were
a piece of furniture; and he would take as little notice of them as though he were the leg
of the piano; though sometimes he would wag his tail gently to and fro, or rap it softly on
the floor, as though appreciating the delicate attention.

       *       *       *       *       *

Of Teddy's reception of the newcomer we had at first some slight misgiving, for, amiable as
we have just seen him with his Maltese companions, and indeed as he is generally by nature,
his is the amiability that comes of conscious power, and is his, so to say, by right of conquest;
for of all neighbouring dogs he is the acknowledged king. The reverse of quarrelsome, the peace
of his declining years has been won by much historical fighting, and his reputation among the
dogs of his acquaintance is such that it is seldom necessary for him to assert his position.
It is only some hapless stranger ignorant of his standing that will occasionally provoke him
to a display of those fighting qualities he grows more and more reluctant to employ. Even with
such he is comparatively merciful; stern, but never brutal. Usually all that is necessary is
for him to look at them steadfastly for a few moments in a peculiar way. This seems to convince
them that, after all, discretion is the better part, and slowly and sadly they turn around
in a curious cowed way, and walk off, apparently too scared to run, with Teddy, like Fate,
grimly at their heels, steadily "pointing" them off the premises. We were a little anxious,
therefore, as to how Teddy would take our little terrier, with his fussy, youthful self-importance,
and eternal restless poking into other folks' affairs. But Teddy, as we might have told ourselves,
had had a long and varied experience of terriers, and had nothing to learn from us. Yet I have
no doubt that, with his instinctive courtesy, he divined the wishes of the family in regard
to the newcomer, and was, therefore, predisposed in his favour. This, however, did not save
the evidently much overawed youngster from a stern and searching examination, the most trying
part of which seemed to be that long, silent, hypnotizing contemplation of him, which is Teddy's
way of asserting his dignity. The little dog visibly trembled beneath the great one's gaze,
his tongue hanging out of his mouth, and his eyes wandering helplessly from side to side; and
he seemed to be saying, in his dog way: "O yes! I know you are a very great and important personage--and
I am only a poor little puppy of no importance. Only please let me go on living--and you will
see how well I will behave." Teddy seemed to be satisfied that some such recognition and submission
had been tendered him; so presently he wagged his tail, that had up till then been rigid as
a ramrod, and not only the little terrier, but all of us, breathed again. Yet it was some time
before Teddy would admit him into anything like what one might call intimacy, and premature
attempts at gamesome familiarity were checked by the gathering thunder of a lazy growl that
unmistakably bade the youngster keep his place. But real friendship eventually grew between
them, on Teddy's side a sort of big-brother affectionate tutelage and guardianship, and on
Puppy's--for, though we tried many, we never found any other satisfactory name for him but
"Puppy"--a reverent admiration and watchful worshipping imitation. No great man was ever more
anxiously copied by some slavish flatterer than that old sleepy carelessly-great setter by
that eager, ambitious little terrier. The occasions when to bark and when not to bark, for
example. One could actually see Puppy studying the old dog's face on doubtful occasions of
the kind. Boiling over, as he visibly was, with the desire to bark his soul out, yet he could
be seen unmistakably restraining himself, till Teddy, after some preliminary soliloquizing
in deep undertones, had made up his mind that the suspicious shuffling-by of probably some
inoffensive Italian workman demanded investigation, and lumberingly risen to his feet and made
for the door. Then, like a bunch of firecrackers, Puppy was at the heels, all officious assistance,
and the two would disappear like an old and a young thunderbolt into the resounding distance.

       *       *       *       *       *

Teddy's friendship had seemed to be definitely won on an occasion which brought home to one
the quaint resemblance between the codes and ways of dogs and those of schoolboys. When the
winter came on, a rather severe one, it soon became evident that the little short-haired fellow
suffered considerably from the cold. Out on walks, he was visibly shivering, though he made
no fuss about it. So one of the angels in the house knitted for him a sort of woollen sweater
buttoned down his neck and under his belly, and trimmed it with some white fur that gave it
an exceedingly smart appearance. Teddy did not happen to be there when it was first tried on,
and, for the moment, Puppy had to be content with our admiration, and his own vast sense of
importance. Certainly, a more self-satisfied terrier never was than he who presently sped out,
to air his new finery before an astonished neighbourhood. But alas! you should have seen him
a few minutes afterwards. We had had the curiosity to stroll out to see how he had got on,
and presently, in a bit of rocky woodland near by, we came upon a curious scene. In the midst
of a clump of red cedars, three great dogs, our Teddy, a wicked old black retriever, and a
bustling be-wigged and be-furred collie, stood in a circle round Puppy, seated on his haunches,
trembling with fear, tongue lolling and eyes wandering, for all the world as though they were
holding a court-martial, or, at all events, a hazing-party. The offence evidently lay with
that dandified new sweater. One and another of the dogs smelt at it, then tugged at it in evident
disgust; and, as each time Puppy made a move to get away, all girt him round with guttural
thunder of disapproval, as much as to say: "Do you call that a thing for a manly dog to go
around in? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you miserable dandy."

We couldn't help reflecting that it was all very well for those great comfortable long-haired
dogs to talk, naturally protected as they were from the cold. Yet that evidently cut no figure
with them, and they went on sniffing and tugging and growling, till we thought our poor Puppy's
eyes and tongue would drop out with fear. Yet, all the time, they seemed to be enjoying his
plight, seemed to be smiling grimly together, wicked old experienced brutes as they were.

Presently the idea of the thing seemed to occur to Puppy, or out of his extremity a new soul
was born within him, for suddenly an infinite disgust of his new foppery seemed to take possession
of him too, and, regaining his courage, he turned savagely upon it, ripping it this way and
that, and struggling with might and main to rid himself of the accursed thing. Presently he
stood free, and barks of approval at once went up from his judges. He had come through his
ordeal, and was once more a dog among dogs. Great was the rejoicing among his friends, and
the occasion having been duly celebrated by joint destruction and contumely of the offending
garment, Teddy and he returned home, friends for life.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is to be feared that that friendship, deep and tender as it grew to be on both sides, perhaps
particularly on Teddy's, was the indirect cause of Puppy's death. I have referred to Teddy's
bark, and how he is not wont to waste it on trivial occasions, or without due thought. On the
other hand, he is proud of it, and loves to practice it--just for its own sake, particularly
on early mornings, when, however fine a bark it is, most of our neighbours would rather continue
sleeping than wake up to listen to it. There is no doubt at all, for those who understand him,
that it is a purely artistic bark. He means no harm to any one by it. When the milkman, his
private enemy, comes at seven, the bark is quite different. This barking of Teddy's seems to
be literally at nothing. Around five o'clock on summer mornings, he plants himself on a knob
of rock overlooking the salt marsh and barks, possibly in honour of the rising sun, but with
no other perceptible purpose. So have I heard men rise in the dawn to practice the cornet--but
they were men, so they ran no risk of their lives. Teddy's practicing, however, has now been
carried on for several years in the teeth of no little peril; and, had it not been for much
human influence employed on his behalf, he would long since have antedated his little friend
in Paradise. When that little friend, however, came to assist and emulate him in those morning
recitals, adding to his bark an occasional--I am convinced purely playful--bite, I am inclined
to think that a sentiment grew in the neighbourhood that one dog at a time was enough. At all
events, Teddy still barks at dawn as of old, but our little Puppy barks no more.

Before the final quietus came to him, there were several occasions on which the Black dog,
called Death, had almost caught him in his jaws. One there was in especial. He had, I believe,
no hatred for any living thing save Italian workmen and automobiles. I have seen an Italian
workman throw his pick-axe at him, and then take to his heels in grotesque flight. But the
pick-axe missed him, as did many another clumsily hurled missile.

       *       *       *       *       *

An automobile, however, on one occasion, came nearer its mark. Like every other dog that ever
barked, particularly terriers, Puppy delighted to harass the feet of fast trotting horses,
mockingly running ahead of them, barking with affected savagery, and by a miracle evading their
on-coming hoofs--which to him, tiny thing as he was, must have seemed like trip-hammers pounding
down from the sky. But horses understand such gaiety in terriers. They understand that it is
only their foolish fun. Automobiles are different. They have no souls. They see nothing engaging
in having their tires snapped at, as they whirl swiftly by; and, one day, after Puppy had flung
himself in a fine fury at the tires of one of these soulless things, he gave a sharp yelp--"not
cowardly!"--and lay a moment on the roadside. But only a moment; then he went limping off on
his three sound legs, and hid himself away from all sympathy, in some unknown spot. It was
in vain we called and sought him, and only after two days was he discovered, in the remotest
corner of a great rocky cellar, determined apparently to die alone in an almost inaccessible
privacy of wood and coal. Yet, when at last we persuaded him that life was still sweet and
carried him upstairs into the great living-room, and the beautiful grandmother, who knows the
sorrows of animals almost as the old Roman seer knew the languages of beasts and birds, had
taken him in charge and made a cosy nest of comforters for him by the fire, and tempted his
languid appetite--to which the very thought of bones was, of course, an offence--with warm,
savory-smelling soup; then, he who had certainly been no coward--for his thigh was a cruel
lump of pain which no human being would have kept so patiently to himself--became suddenly,
like many human invalids, a perfect glutton of self-pity; and when we smoothed and patted him
and told him how sorry we were, it was laughable, and almost uncanny, how he suddenly set up
a sort of moaning talk to us, as much as to say that he certainly had had a pretty bad time,
was really something of a hero, and deserved all the sympathy we would give him. So far as
one can be sure about anything so mysterious as animals, I am sure that from then on he luxuriated
in his little hospital by the fireside, and played upon the feelings of his beautiful nurse,
and of his various solicitous visitors, with all the histrionic skill of the spoiled and petted
convalescent. Suddenly, however, one day, he forgot his part. He heard some inspiring barking
going on nearby--and, in a flash, his comforters were thrust aside, and he was off and away
to join the fun. Then, of course, we knew that he was well again; though he still went briskly
about his various business on three legs for several days.

His manner was quite different, however, the afternoon he had so evidently come home to die.
There was no pose about the little forlorn figure, which, after a mysterious absence of two
days, suddenly appeared, as we were taking tea on the veranda, already the very ghost of himself.
Wearily he sought the cave of the beautiful grandmother's skirts, where, whenever he had had
a scolding, he was wont always to take refuge--barking, fiercely, as from an inaccessible fortress,
at his enemies.

       *       *       *       *       *

But, this afternoon, there was evidently no bark in him, poor little fellow; everything about
him said that he had just managed to crawl home to die. His brisk white coat seemed dank with
cold dews, and there was something shadowy about him and strangely quiet. His eyes, always
so alert, were strangely heavy and indifferent, yet questioning and somehow accusing. He seemed
to be asking us why a little dog should suffer so, and what was going to happen to him, and
what did it all mean. Alas! We could not tell him; and none of us dare say to each other that
our little comrade in the mystery of life was going to die. But a silence fell over us all,
and the beautiful grandmother took him into her care, and so well did her great and wise heart
nurse him through the night that next morning it almost seemed as though we had been wrong;
for a flash of his old spirit was in him again, and, though his little legs shook under him,
it was plain that he wanted to try and be up at his day's work on the veranda, warning off
the passer-by, or in the garden carrying on his eternal investigations, or farther afield in
the councils and expeditions of his fellows. So we let him have his way, and for a while he
seemed happier and stronger for the sunshine, and the old familiar scents and sounds. But the
one little tired husky bark he gave at his old enemy, the Italian workman, passing by, would
have broken your heart; and the effort he made with a bone, as he visited the well-remembered
neighbourhood of the ice-box for the last time, was piteous beyond telling. Those sharp, strong
teeth that once could bite and grind through anything could do nothing with it now. To lick
it sadly with tired lips, in a sort of hopeless way, was all that was left; and there was really
a look in his face as though he accepted this mortal defeat, as he lay down, evidently exhausted
with his exertions, on a bank nearby. But once more his spirit seemed to revive, and he scrambled
to his legs again and wearily crawled to the back of the house, where the beautiful grandmother
loves to sit and look over the glittering salt-marsh in the summer afternoons.

       *       *       *       *       *

Of course, he knew that she was there. She had been his best friend in this strange world.
His last effort was naturally to be near her again. Almost he reached that kind cave of her
skirts. Only another yard or two and he had been there. But the energy that had seemed irrepressible
and everlasting had come to its end, and the little body had to give in at last, and lie down
wearily once more with no life left but the love in its fading eyes.

There are some, I suppose, who may wonder how one can write about the death of a mere dog like
this; and cannot understand how the death of a little terrier can make the world seem a lonelier
place. But there are others, I know, who will scarce need telling, men and women with little
ghosts of their own haunting their moonlit gardens; strange, appealing, faithful companions,
kind little friendly beings that journeyed with them awhile the pilgrimage of the soul.

I often wonder if Teddy misses his little busy playfellow and disciple as we do; if, perhaps,
as he barks over the marsh of a morning, he is sending him a message. There is no sign of sorrow
upon him. But he is old and very wise, and keeps strange knowledge to himself. So, who can say?

XVI

THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE

For the genuine lover of nature, as distinct from the connoisseur of dainty or spectacular
"scenery," nature has always and everywhere some charm or satisfaction. He will find it no
less--some say more--in winter than in summer, and I have little doubt that the great Alkali
Desert is not entirely without its enthusiasts. The nature among which we spent our childhood
is apt to have a lasting hold on us, in defiance of showier competition, and I suppose there
is no land with soul so dead that it does not boast itself the fairest under heaven.

I am writing this surrounded by a natural scene which I would not exchange for the Swiss lakes,
yet I presume it is undeniable that Switzerland has a more universal reputation for natural
beauty than Connecticut. It is, as we say, one of the show places of the earth. So Niagara
Falls, the Grand Cañon, the Rockies, and California generally lord it over America. Italy has
such a reputation for beauty that it is almost unfair to expect her to live up to it. I once
ventured to say that the Alps must be greasy with being climbed, and it says much for such
stock pieces in nature's repertoire, that, in spite of all the wear and tear of sentimental
travellers, the mock-admiration of generations, the batteries of amateur cameras, the Riviera,
the English lakes, the Welsh mountains, the Highlands of Scotland, and other tourist-trodden
classics of the picturesque, still remain haunts of beauty and joys forever. God's masterpieces
do not easily wear out.

Every country does something supremely well, and England may be said to have a patent for a
certain kind of scenery which Americans are the first to admire. English scenery has no more
passionate pilgrim than the traveller from the United States, as the visitors' books of its
various show-places voluminously attest. Perhaps it is not difficult, when one has lived in
both countries, to understand why.

While America, apart from its impressive natural splendours, is rich also in idyllic and pastoral
landscape, it has, as yet, but little "countryside." I say, as yet, because "the countryside,"
I think I am right in feeling, is not entirely a thing of nature's making, but rather a collaboration
resulting from nature and man living so long in partnership together. In England, with which
the word is peculiarly, if not exclusively, associated, God is not entirely to be credited
with making the country. Man has for generations also done his share.

It is perhaps not without significance that the word "countryside" was not to be found in Webster's
dictionary, till a recent edition. Originally, doubtless, it was used with reference to those
rural districts in the vicinity of a town; as one might say the country side of the town. Not
wild or solitary nature was meant, but nature humanized, made companionable by the presence
and occupations of man; a nature which had made the winding highway, the farm, and the pasture,
even the hamlet, with its church tower and its ancient inn, one with herself.

The American, speeding up to London from his landing either at Liverpool or Southampton, always
exclaims on the gardenlike aspect, the deep, rich greenness of the landscape. It is not so
much the specific evidences of cultivation, though those, of course, are plentifully present,
but a general air of ripeness and order. Even the land not visible under cultivation suggests
immemorial care and fertility. We feel that this land has been fought over and ploughed over,
nibbled over by sheep, sown and reaped, planted and drained, walked over, hunted over, and
very much beloved, for centuries. It is not fanciful to see in it a land to which its people
have been stubbornly and tenderly devoted--still "Shakespeare's England," still his favoured
"isle set in the silver sea."

As seen from the railway-carriage window, one is struck, too, by the comparative tidiness of
the English landscape. There are few loose ends, and the outskirts of villages are not those
distressing dump-heaps which they too often are in America. Yet there is no excessive air of
trimness. The order and grooming seem a part of nature's processes. There is, too, a casual
charm about the villages themselves, the graceful, accidental grouping of houses and gardens,
which suggests growth rather than premeditation. The general harmony does not preclude, but
rather comes of, the greatest variety of individual character.

Herein the English village strikingly differs from the typical New England village, where the
charm comes of a prim uniformity, and individuality is made to give place to a general parking
of lawns and shade-trees in rectangular blocks and avenues. A New England village suggests
some large institution disposed in separate uniform buildings, placed on one level carpet of
green, each with a definite number of trees, and the very sunlight portioned out into gleaming
allotments. The effect gained is for me one of great charm--the charm of a vivid, exquisitely
ordered, green silence, with a touch of monastic, or Quakerish, decorum. I would not have it
otherwise, and I speak of it only to suggest by contrast the different, desultory charm of
an old English village, where beauty has not been so much planned, as has just "occurred."

Of course, this is the natural result of the long occupation of the land. Each century in succession
has had a hand in shaping the countryside to its present aspect, and English history is literally
a living visible part of English scenery. Here the thirteenth century has left a church, here
the fourteenth a castle, here the sixteenth, with its suppression of the monasteries, a ruined
abbey. Here is an inn where Chaucer's pilgrims stopped on the way to Canterbury. Here, in a
field covered over by a cow-shed, is a piece of tessellated pavement which was once the floor
of an old country house occupied by one of Caesar's generals.

Those strange grassy mounds breaking the soft sky-line of the rolling South Downs are the tombs
of Saxon chieftains, that rubble of stones at the top of yonder hill was once a British camp,
and those curious ridges terracing yonder green slope mark the trenches of some prehistoric
battlefield. All these in the process of time have become part and parcel of the English countryside,
as necessary to its "English" character as its trees and its wild flowers.

How much, too, the English countryside owes for its beauty to the many old manor-houses, gabled
and moated, with their quaint, mossy-walled gardens and great forestlike parks. Whatever we
may think of the English territorial system as economics, its service to English scenery has
been incalculable. Without English traditionalism we should hardly have had the English countryside.

The conservation of great estates, entailing a certain conservatism in the treatment of farm
lands from generation to generation, and the upholding, too, of game-preserves, however obnoxious
to the land reformer, have been all to the good of the nature-lover. We owe no little of the
beauty of the English woodland to the English pheasant; and with the coming of land nationalization
we may expect to see considerable changes in the English countryside. Meanwhile, in spite of,
or perhaps because of, the feudalistic character of English landlordism, the Englishman enjoys
a right of walking over his native land of which no capitalist can rob him. Hence results another
charming feature of the English countryside--the footpaths you see everywhere winding over
hill and dale, through field and coppice. The ancient rights of these are safeguarded to the
people forever by statute no wealth can defy; and, let any nouveau riche of a landlord try
to close one of them, and he has to reckon with one of the pluckiest and most persistent organizations
of English John Hampdens, the society that makes the protection of these traditional pathways
its particular care. So the rich man cannot lock up his trees and his woodland glades all for
himself, but is compelled to share them to the extent of allowing the poorest pedestrian to
walk through them--which is about all the rich man can do with them himself.

These footpaths, in conjunction with English lanes, have made the charm of walking tours in
England proverbial. Certain counties particularly pride themselves on their lands. Surrey and
Devonshire are the great rivals in this respect. We say "Surrey lanes" or "Devonshire lanes,"
as we speak of "Italian skies" or "Southern hospitality." Other counties--Warwickshire, for
example--doubtless have lanes no less lovely, but Surrey and Devonshire have, so to say, got
the decision; and, if an American traveller wants to see a typical English lane, he goes to
Surrey or Devonshire, just as, if he wants a typical English pork-pie, he sends to Melton Mowbray.

And the English lane has come honestly by its reputation. You may be disappointed in Venice,
but you will be hard to please if you are not caught by the spell of an English lane. Of course,
you must not expect to feel that spell if you tear through it in a motor-car. It was made for
the loiterer, as its whimsical twists and turns plainly show. If you are in a hurry, you had
better keep to the king's highway, stretching swift and white on the king's business. The English
lane was made for the leisurely meandering of cows to and from pasture, for the dreamy snail-pace
of time-forgetting lovers, for children gathering primroses or wild strawberries, or for the
knap-sacked wayfarer to whom time and space are no objects, whose destination is anywhere and
nowhere, whose only clocks are the rising sun and the evening star, and to whom the way means
more than the goal.

I should not have spoken of it as "made," for, when it is most characteristic, an English lane
has no suggestion of ever having been man-made like other roads. It seems as much a natural
feature as the woods or meadows through which it passes; and sometimes, as in Surrey, when
it runs between high banks, tunnelling its way under green boughs, it seems more like an old
river-bed than a road, whose sides nature has tapestried with ferns and flowers. Of all roads
in the world it is the dreamer's road, luring on the wayfarer with perpetual romantic promise
and surprise, winding on and on, one can well believe, into the very heart of fairy-land. Everything
beautiful seems to be waiting for us somewhere in the turnings of an English lane.

Had I sat down to write of the English countryside two years ago, I should have done so with
a certain amount of cautious skepticism. I should have said to myself: "You have not visited
England for over ten years. Are you quite sure that your impressions of its natural beauties
are not the rose-coloured exaggerations of memory? Are not time and distance lending their
proverbial enchantment?" In fact, as I set sail to revisit England, the spring before last,
it was in some such mood of anticipatory disillusion.

After all, I had said to myself, is not the English countryside the work of the English poets--the
English spring, the English wild flowers, the English lark, the English nightingale, and so
forth? That longing of Browning expressed in the lines,

          O to be in England
          Now that April's there!

was, after all, the cry of a homesick versifier, thinking "Home Thoughts, from Abroad"; and
are Herrick and Wordsworth quite to be trusted on the subject of daffodils?

Well, I am glad to have to own that my revisiting my native land resulted in an agreeable disappointment.
With a critical American eye, jealously on my guard against sentimental superstition, I surveyed
the English landscape and examined its various vaunted beauties and fascinations, as though
making their acquaintance for the first time. No, my youthful raptures had not been at fault,
and the poets were once more justified. The poets are seldom far wrong. If they see anything,
it is usually there. If we cannot see it, too, it is the fault of our eyes.

Take the English hawthorn, for instance. As its fragrance is wafted to you from the bushes
where it hangs like the fairest of white linen, you will hardly, I think, quarrel with its
praises. Yet, though it is, if I am not mistaken, of rare occurrence in America, it is not
absolutely necessary to go to England for the hawthorn. Any one who cares to go a-Maying along
the banks of the Hudson, in the neighbourhood of Peekskill, will find it there. But for the
primrose and the cowslip you must cross the sea; and, if you come upon such a wood as I strayed
into, my last visit, you will count it worth the trip. It was literally carpeted with clumps
of primroses and violets (violets that smell, too) so thickly massed together in the mossy
turf that there was scarcely room to tread. There are no words rich or abundant enough to suggest
the sense of innocent luxury brought one by such a natural Persian carpet of soft gold and
dewy purple, at once so gorgeous and yet so gentle. In all this lavish loveliness of English
wild flowers there is, indeed, a peculiar tenderness. The innocence of children seems to be
in them, and the tenderness of lovers.

          A lover would not tread
          A cowslip on the head--

How appropriately such lines come to mind as one carefully picks one's way down a green hillside
yellow with cowslips, and breathing perhaps the most delicate of all flowery fragrances. Yet
again, as we pass into another stretch of woodland, another profusion and another fragrance
await us, the winey perfume and the spectral blue sheen of the wild hyacinth. As one comes
upon stretches of these hyacinths in the woods, they seem at first glance like pools of blue
water or fallen pieces of the sky. Here, for once, the poets are left behind, and, of them
all, Shakespeare and Milton alone have come near to suggesting the loveliness, at once so spiritual
and so warmly and sweetly of the earth, that belongs to English wild flowers. I know not if
Sheffield steel still keeps its position among the eternal verities, but in an age when so
many of one's cherished beliefs are threatened with the scrap-heap, I count it of no small
importance to be able to retain one's faith in the English lark and English wild flowers.

But the English countryside is not all greenness and softness, blossomy lanes, moated granges,
and idyllic villages. It by no means always suggests the gardener, the farmer, or the gamekeeper.
It is rich, too, in wildness and solitude, in melancholy fens and lonely moorlands. To the
American accustomed to the vast areas of his own enormous continent, it would come as a surprise
to realize that a land far smaller than many of his States can in certain places give one so
profound a sense of the wilderness. Yet I doubt if a man could feel lonelier anywhere in the
world than on a Yorkshire moor or on Salisbury Plain.

After all, we are apt to forget that, even on the largest continent, we can see only a limited
portion of the earth at once. When one is in the middle of Lake Erie we are as much out of
sight of land, as impressed by the illusion of boundless water, as if we were in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean. So, on Salisbury Plain, with nothing but rolling billows of close-cropped
turf, springy and noiseless to the tread, as far as the eye can see, one feels as alone with
the universe as in the middle of some Asian desert. In addition to the actual loneliness of
the scene, and a silence broken only by the occasional tinkle of sheep-bells, as a flock moves
like a fleecy cloud across the grass, is an imaginative loneliness induced by the overwhelming
sense of boundless unrecorded time, the "dim-grey-grown ages," of which the mysterious boulders
of Stonehenge are the voiceless witnesses. To experience this feeling to the full one should
come upon an old Roman road in the twilight, grass-grown, choked with underbrush, but still
running straight and clearly defined as when it shook to the tread of Roman legions. It is
eery to follow one of these haunted roads, filled with the far-off thoughts and fancies it
naturally evokes, and then suddenly to come out again into the world of today, as it joins
the highway once more, and the lights of a wayside inn welcome us back to humanity, with perhaps
a touring car standing at the door.

One need hardly say that the English wayside inn is as much a feature of the English countryside
as the English hawthorn. Its praises have been the theme of essayists and poets for generations,
and at its best there is a cosiness and cheer about it which warm the heart, as its quaintness
and savour of past days keep alive the sense of romantic travel. There the spirit of ancient
hospitality still survives, and, though the motor-car has replaced the stage-coach, that is,
after all, but a detail, and the old, low-ceilinged rooms, the bay windows with their leaded
panes, the tap-room with its shining vessels, the great kitchen, the solid English fare, the
brass candlesticks at bedtime, and the lavendered sheets, still preserve the atmosphere of
a novel by Fielding or an essay by Addison.

There still, as in Shakespeare's day, one can take one's ease at one's inn, as perhaps in the
hostelries of no other land. It is the frequency and excellence of these English inns that
make it charmingly possible to see England, as it is best seen, on foot or on a bicycle. It
is not a country of isolated wonders, with long stretches of mere road between. Every mile
counts for something. But, if the luxury of walking it with stick and knapsack is denied us,
and we must needs see it by motor-car, we cannot fail to make one observation, that of the
surprising variety of natural scenery packed in so small a space. Between Land's End and the
Tweed the eye and the imagination have encountered every form of the picturesque. In an area
some three hundred and fifty miles long by three hundred broad are contained the ruggedness
of Cornwall, the idyllic softness of Devon, the dreamy solitudes of the South Downs, with their
billowy, chalky contours, the agricultural fertility of Kent and Middlesex, the romantic woodlands
and hilly pastures of Surrey, the melancholy fens of Lincolnshire, the broad, bosky levels
of the midlands, the sudden wildness of Wales, with her mountains and glens, Yorkshire, with
its grim, heather-clad moors, Westmoreland, with its fells and Wordsworthian "Lakes"; every
note in the gamut of natural beauty has been struck, from honeysuckle prettiness to savage
grandeur.

Yet, although all these contrasts are included in the English scene, it is not of solitude
or grandeur that we think when we speak of the English countryside. They are the exceptions
to the rule of a gentler, more humanized natural beauty, in which the village church and the
ivy-clad ruin play their part. Perhaps some such formula as this would represent the typical
scene that springs to the mind's eye with the phrase "the English countryside": a village green,
with some geese stringing out across it. A straggle of quaint thatched cottages, roses climbing
about the windows, and in front little, carefully kept gardens, with hollyhocks standing in
rows, stocks and sweet-williams and such old-fashioned flowers. At one end of the village,
rising out of a clump of yews, the mouldering church-tower, with mossy gravestones on one side
and a trim rectory on the other. At the other end of the village a gabled inn, with a great
stable-yard, busy with horses and waggons. Above the village, the slopes of gently rising pastures,
intersected with footpaths and shadowed with woodlands. A little way out of the village, an
old mill with a lilied mill-pond, a great, dripping water-wheel, and the murmur of the escaping
stream. And winding on into the green, sun-steeped distance, the blossom-hung English lanes.

LONDON--CHANGING AND UNCHANGING

I find it an unexpectedly strange experience to be in London again after ten years in New York.
I had no idea it could be so strange. Of course, there are men to whom one great city is as
another--commercial travellers, impresarios, globe-trotting millionaires. Being none of these,
I am not as much at home in St. Petersburg as in Buda-Pesth, in Berlin as in Paris, and, while
once I might have envied such plastic cosmopolitanism, I am realizing, this last day or two
in London, that, were such an accomplishment mine, it had been impossible for me to feel as
deeply as I do my brief reincarnation into a city and a country with which I was once so intimate,
and which now seems so romantically strange, while remaining so poignantly familiar. The man
who is at home everywhere has nowhere any home. My home was once this London--this England--in
which I am writing; but nothing so much as being in London again could make me realize that
my home now is New York, and how long and how instinctively, without knowing it, I have been
an American. It is not indeed that I love New York and America more than I love London and
England. In fact, London has never seemed so wonderful to me in the past as she has seemed
during these days of my wistful momentary return to her strange great heart. But this very
freshness of her marvel to one who once deemed that he knew her so well proves but the completeness
of my spiritual acclimatization into another land. I seem to be seeing her face, hearing her
voice, for the first time; while, all the while, my heart is full with unforgotten memories,
and my eyes have scarce the hardihood to gaze with the decorum befitting the public streets
on many a landmark of vanished hours. To find London almost as new and strange to me as New
York once seemed when I first sighted her soaring morning towers, and yet to know her for an
enchanted Ghost-Land; to be able to find my way through her streets--in spite of the new Kingsway
and Aldwych!--with closed eyes, and yet to see her, it almost seems, for the first time: surely
it is a curious, almost uncanny, experience.

Do I find London changed?--I am asked. I have been so busy in rediscovering what I had half-forgotten,
in finding engaging novelties in things anciently familiar, that the question is one which
I feel hardly competent to answer. For instance, I had all but forgotten that there was so
noble a thing in the world as an old-fashioned English pork-pie. Yesterday I saw one in a window,
with a thrill of recognition, that made a friend with whom I was walking think for a moment
that I had seen a ghost. He knows nothing of the human heart who cannot realize how tremulous
with ancient heart-break may seem an old-fashioned English pork-pie--after ten years in America.

And, again, how curiously novel and charming seemed the soft and courteous English voices--with
or without aitches--all about one in the streets and in the shops--I had almost said the "stores."
I am enamoured of the American accent, these many years, and--the calumny of superficial observation
to the contrary--I will maintain, so far as my own experience goes, that there is as much courtesy
broadcast in America as in any land; more, I am inclined to think than in France. Yet, for
all that, that something or other in the English voice which I had heard long since and lost
awhile smote me with a peculiar pleasure, and, though I like the comradely American "Cap" or
"Professor," and am hoping soon to hear it again--yet the novelty of being addressed once more
as "Sir" has had, I must own, a certain antiquarian charm.

Wandering in a quaint by-street near my hotel, and reading the names and signs on one or two
of the neat old-world "places of business," I came on the word "sweep." I believe it was on
a brass-plate. For a moment, I wondered what it meant; and then I realized, with a great gratitude,
that London had not changed so much, after all, since the days of Charles Lamb. As I emerged
into a broader thoroughfare, my ears were smitten with the sound of minstrelsy. It is true
that the tune was changed. It was unmistakably rag-time. Yet, there was the old piano-organ,
and in a broad circle of spectators, suspended awhile from their various wayfaring, a young
man in tennis flannels was performing a spirited Apache dance with a quite comely short-skirted
young woman, who rightly enough felt that she had no need to be ashamed of her legs. Across
the extemporized stage, every now and then, taxicabs tooted cautiously, longing in their hearts
to stay; and once a motor coal-waggon, like a sort of amateur freight-train, thundered across;
but not even these could break the spell that held that ring of enchanted loiterers, from which
presently the pennies fell like rain--the eternal spell--still operating, I was glad to see,
under the protection of the only human police in the world--of the strolling player in London
town. Just before the players turned to seek fresh squares and alleys new, I noticed on the
edge of the crowd what seemed, in the gathering twilight, to be a group of uplifted spears.
Spears or halberds, were they? It was a little company of the ancient brotherhood of lamp-lighters,
seduced, like the rest of us, from the strict pursuance of duty by the vagabond music.

To me this thought is full of reassurance, whatever be the murmurs of change: London has still
her sweeps, her strolling minstrels, and her lamp-lighters.

Of course, I missed at once the old busses, yet there are far more horses left than I had dared
to hope, and the hansom is far from extinct. In fact, there seems to be some promise of its
renaissance, and even yet, in the words of the ancient bard, despite the competition of taxis--

          Like dragon-flies,
            The hansoms hover
          With jewelled eyes,
            To catch the lover.

Further,--the quietude of the Temple remains undisturbed, the lawns of Gray's Inn are green
as of old, the Elizabethanism of Staple Inn is unchanged, about the cornices of the British
Museum the pigeons still flutter and coo, and the old clocks chime sweetly as of old from their
mysterious stations aloft somewhere in the morning and the evening sky.

Changes, of course, there are. It is easier to telephone in London today than it was ten years
ago--almost as easy as in some little provincial town in Connecticut. Various minor human conveniences
have been improved. The electric lighting is better. Some of the elevators--I mean the "lifts"--almost
remind one of New York. The problem of "rapid transit" has been simplified. All which things,
however, have nothing to do with national characteristics, but are now the common property
of the civilized, or rather, I should say, the commercialized, world, and are probably to be
found no less in full swing in Timbuctoo. No one--save, maybe, the citizens of some small imitative
nation--confounds these things with change, or calls them "progress." The soul of a great old
nation adopts all such contrivances as in the past it has adopted new weapons, or new modes
of conveyance. Only a Hottentot or a Cook's Tourist can consider such superficial developments
as evidences of "change."

There are, of course, some new theatres--though I have heard of no new great actor or actress.
The old "favourites" still seem to dominate the play-bills, as they did ten years ago. There
is Mr. Hammerstein's Opera House in the Kingsway. I looked upon it with pathos. Yet, surely,
it is a monument not so much of changing London as of that London which sees no necessity of
change.

In regard to the great new roadways, Kingsway, Aldwych, and the broadening of the Strand, I
have been grateful for the temper which seems to have presided over their making--a temper
combining the necessary readjustment of past and present, with a spirit of sensitive conservation
for those buildings which more and more England will realize as having a lasting value for
her spirit.

So far as I have observed, London has been guilty of no such vandalism as is responsible for
the new Boulevard Raspail in Paris, and similar heartless destructiveness, in a city which
belongs less to France than to the human soul. Such cities as London and Paris are among the
eternal spiritual possessions of mankind. If only those temporarily in charge of them could
be forced somehow to remember that, when their brief mayoral, or otherwise official, lives
are past, there will be found those who will need to look upon what they have destroyed, and
who will curse them in their graves.

Putting aside such merely superficial "changes" as new streets, new theatres, and new conveniences,
there does seem to me one change of a far higher importance for which I have no direct evidence,
and which I can only hint at, even to myself, as "something in the air." It is, of course,
nothing new either to London or to England. It is rather the reawakening of an old temper to
which England's history has so often and so momentously given expression. I seem to find it
in a new alertness in the way men and women walk and talk in the streets, a braced-up expectancy
and readiness for some approaching development in England's destiny, a new quickening of that
old indomitable spirit that has faced not merely external dangers, but grappled with and resolved
her own internal problems. London seems to me like a city that has heard a voice crying "Arise,
thou that sleepest!" and is answering to the cry with girt loins and sloth-purged heart and
blithe readiness for some new unknown summons of a future that can but develop the glory of
her past.

England seems to be no more sleepily resting on her laurels, as she was some twenty years ago.
Nor does she seem, on the other hand, to show the least anxiety that she could ever lose them.
She is merely realizing that the time is at hand when she is to win others--that one more of
those many re-births of England, so to speak, out of her own womb, approaches, and that once
more she is about to prove herself eternally young.

New countries are apt to speak of old countries as though they are dying, merely because they
have lived so long. Yet there is a longevity which is one of the surest evidences of youth.
Such I seem to feel once more is England's--as from my window I watch the same old English
May weather: the falling rain and the rich gloom, within which moves always, shouldering the
darkest hour, an oceanic radiance, a deathless principle of celestial fire.

LONDON, May, 1913.

XVIII

THE HAUNTED RESTAURANT

Were one to tell the proprietors of the very prosperous and flamboyant restaurant of which
I am thinking that it is haunted--yea, that ghosts sit at its well appointed tables, and lost
voices laugh and wail and sing low to themselves through its halls--they would probably take
one for a lunatic--a servant of the moon.

Certainly, to all appearance, few places would seem less to suggest the word "haunted" than
that restaurant, as one comes upon it, in one of the busiest of London thoroughfares, spreading
as it does for blocks around, like a conflagration, the festive glare of its electrically emblazoned
façade. Yet no ruined mansion, with the moon shining in through its shattered roof, the owl
nesting in its banqueting hall, and the snake gliding through its bed chambers, was ever more
peopled with phantoms than this radiant palace of prandial gaiety, apparently filled with the
festive murmur of happy diners, the jocund strains of its vigorous orchestra, the subdued clash
of knives and forks and delicate dishes, the rustle of women's gowns and the fairy music of
women's voices. For me its portico, flaming like a vortex of dizzy engulfing light, upon which,
as upon a swift current, gay men and women, alighting from motor and hansom, are swept inward
to glittering tables of snow-white napery, fair with flowers--for me the mouth of the grave
is not less dread, and the walls of a sepulchre are not so painted with dead faces or so inscribed
with elegiac memories. I could spend a night in Père-la-Chaise, and still be less aware of
the presence of the dead than I was a short time ago, when, greatly daring, I crossed with
a shudder that once so familiar threshold.

It was twelve years since I had been in London, so I felt no little of a ghost myself, and
I knew too well that it would be vain to look for the old faces. Yes, gone was the huge good-natured
commissionaire, who so often in the past, on my arrival in company with some human flower,
had flung open the apron of our cab with such reverential alacrity, and on our departure had
so gently tucked in the petals of her skirts, smiling the while a respectfully knowing benediction
on the prospective continuance of our evening's adventure. Another stood in his place, and
watched my lonely arrival with careless indifference. Glancing through the window of the treasurer's
office to the right of the hall, I could see that an unfamiliar figure sat at the desk, where
in the past so many a cheque had been cashed for me with eager bonhomie. Now I reflected that
considerable identification would be necessary for that once light-hearted transaction. It
is true that I was welcomed with courtesy by a bowing majordomo, but alas, my welcome was that
of a stranger; and when I mounted the ornate, marble-walled staircase leading to the gallery
where I had always preferred to sit, I realized that my hat and cane must pass into alien keeping,
and that no waiter's face would light up as he saw me threading my way to the sacred table,
withdrawn in a nook of the balcony, where one could see and hear all, participate in the general
human stir and atmosphere, and yet remain apart.

Ah! no; for the friendly Cockney that once greeted me with an enfolding paternal kindness was
substituted broken English of a less companionable accent. A polite young Greek it was who
stood waiting respectfully for my order, knowing nothing of all it meant for me--me--to be
seated at that table again--whereas, had he been one of half a dozen of the waiters of yester-year,
he would have known almost as much as I of the "secret memoirs" of that historic table.

In ordering my meal I made no attempt at sentiment, for my mood went far deeper than sentiment.
Indeed, though, every second of the time, I was living so vividly, so cruelly, in the past,
I made one heartbroken acknowledgment of the present by beginning with the anachronism of a
dry Martini cocktail, which, twelve years previous, was unknown and unattainable in that haunted
gallery. That cocktail was a sort of desperate epitaph. It meant that I was alone--alone with
my ghosts. Yet it had a certain resurrecting influence, and as I sat there proceeding dreamily
with my meal, one face and another would flash before me, and memory after memory re-enact
itself in the theatre of my fancy. So much in my actual surroundings brought back the past
with an aching distinctness--particularly the entrance of two charming young people, making
rainbows all about them, as, ushered by a smiling waiter, who was evidently no stranger to
their felicity, they seated themselves at a neighbouring table with a happy sigh, and neglected
the menu for a moment or two while they gazed, rapt and lost, into each other's eyes. How well
I knew it all; how easily I could have taken the young man's place, and played the part for
which this evening he was so fortunately cast! As I looked at them, I instinctively summoned
to my side the radiant shade of Aurea, for indeed she had seemed made of gold--gold and water
lilies. And, as of old, when I had called to her, she came swiftly with a luxurious rustle
of fragrant skirts, like the sound of the west wind among the summer trees, or the swish and
sway of the foam about the feet of Aphrodite. There she sat facing me once more, "a feasting
presence made of light"--her hair like a golden wheat sheaf, her eyes like blue flowers amid
the wheat, and her bosom, by no means parsimoniously concealed, literally suggesting that the
loveliness of all the water lilies in the world was amassed there within her corset as in some
precious casket. Ours was not one of the great tragic loves, but I know I shall think of Aurea's
bosom on my death-bed. At her coming I had ordered champagne--we always drank champagne together,
because, as we said, it matched so well with her hair--champagne of a no longer fashionable
brand. The waiter seemed a little surprised to hear it asked for, but it had been the only
chic brand in 19--.

"Look at those two yonder," I said presently, after we had drunk to each other, smiling long
into each other's eyes over the brims of our glasses. "You and I were once as they. It is their
first wonderful dinner together. Watch them--the poor darlings; it is enough to break one's heart."

"Do you remember ours?" asked Aurea quite needlessly.

"I wonder what else I was thinking of--dear idiot!" said I, with tender elegance, as in the
old days.

As I said before, Aurea and I had not been tragic in our love. It was more a matter of life--than
death; warm, pagan, light-hearted life. Ours was perhaps that most satisfactory of relationships
between men and women, which contrives to enjoy the happiness, the fun, even the ecstasy, of
loving, while evading its heartache. It was, I suppose, what one would call a healthy physical
enchantment, with lots of tenderness and kindness in it, but no possibility of hurt to each
other. There was nothing Aurea would not have done for me, or I for Aurea, except--marry each
other; and, as a matter of fact, there were certain difficulties on both sides in the way of
our doing that, difficulties, however, which I am sure neither of us regretted.

Yes, Aurea and I understood thoroughly what was going on in those young hearts, as we watched
them, our eyes starry with remembrance. Who better than we should know that hush and wonder,
that sense of enchanted intimacy, which belongs of all moments perhaps in the progress of a
passion to that moment when two standing tiptoe on the brink of golden surrender, sit down
to their first ambrosial meal together--delicious adventure!--with all the world to watch them,
if it choose, and yet aloof in a magic loneliness, as of youthful divinities wrapped in a roseate
cloud! Hours of divine expectancy, at once promise and fulfilment.

"See," said Aurea presently, "they are getting ready to go. The waiter has brought the bill,
and is looking away, suddenly lost in profound meditation. Let us see how he pays the bill.
I am sure she is anxious."

"Your old test!" said I. "Do you remember?"

"Yes! And it's one that never fails," said Aurea with decision. "When a woman goes out to dinner
with a man for the first time, he little knows how much is going to depend on his way of paying
the bill. If, as with some men one meets, he studies it through a microscope and adds it up
with anxious brow--meanwhile quite evidently forgetting your presence--how your heart sinks,
sinks and hardens--but you are glad all the same, and next day you congratulate yourself on
your narrow escape!"

"Was I like that?" said I.

"Did we escape?" asked Aurea. Then she added, touching my arm as with a touch of honeyed fire:
"O I'm so glad! He did it delightfully--quite en prince. Just the right nonchalance--and perhaps,
poor dear, he's as poor--"

"As we often were," I added.

And then through the corners of our eyes we saw the young lovers rise from the table, and the
man enfold his treasure in her opera cloak, O so reverently, O so tenderly, as though he were
wrapping up some holy flower. And O those deep eyes she gave him, half turning her head as
he did so!

"That look," whispered Aurea, quoting Tennyson, "'had been a clinging kiss but for the street.'"

Then suddenly they were gone, caught up like Enoch, into heaven--some little heaven, maybe,
like one that Aurea and I remember, high up under the ancient London roofs.

But, with their going, alas, Aurea had vanished too, and I was left alone with my Greek waiter,
who was asking me what cheese I would prefer.

With the coming of coffee and cognac, I lit my cigar and settled down to deliberate reverie,
as an opium smoker gives himself up to his dream. I savoured the bitter-sweetness of my memories;
I took a strange pleasure in stimulating the ache of my heart with vividly recalled pictures
of innumerable dead hours. I systematically passed from table to table all around that spacious
peristyle. There was scarcely one at which I had not sat with some vanished companion in those
years of ardent, irresponsible living which could never come again. Not always a woman had
been the companion whose form I thus conjured out of the past, too often out of the grave;
for the noble friendship of youth haunted those tables as well, with its generous starry-eyed
enthusiasms and passionate loyalties. Poets of whom but their songs remain, themselves by tragic
pathways descended into the hollow land, had read their verses to me there, still glittering
with the dawn dew of their creation, as we sat together over the wine and talked of the only
matters then--and perhaps even yet--worth talking of: love and literature. Of these but one
can still be met in London streets, but all now wear crowns of varying brightness--

          Where the oldest bard is as the young,
            And the pipe is ever dropping honey,
          And the lyre's strings are ever strung.

Dear boon fellows of life as well as literature, how often have we risen from those tables,
to pursue together the not too swiftly flying petticoat, through the terrestrial firmament
of shining streets, aglow with the midnight sun of pleasure, a-dazzle with eyes brighter far
than the city lamps--passionate pilgrims of the morning star! Ah! we go on such quests no more--"another
race hath been and other palms are won."

No, not always women--but naturally women nearly always, for it was the time of rosebuds, and
we were wisely gathering them while we might--

          Through the many to the one--
             O so many!
          Kissing all and missing none,
             Loving any.

Every man who has lived a life worthy the name of living has his own private dream of fair
women, the memory of whom is as a provision laid up against the lean years that must come at
last, however long they may be postponed by some special grace of the gods, which is, it is
good to remember, granted to some--the years when one has reluctantly to accept that the lovely
game is almost, if not quite at an end, and to watch the bloom and abundance of fragrant young
creatures pass us, unregarding, by. And, indeed, it may happen that a man who has won what
is for him the fairest of all fair faces, and has it still by his side, may enter sometimes,
without disloyalty, that secret gallery of those other fair faces that were his before hers,
in whom they are all summed up and surpassed, had dawned upon his life. We shall hardly be
loyal to the present if we are coldly disloyal to the past. In the lover's calendar, while
there is but one Madonna, there must still be minor saints, to whom it is meet, at certain
times and seasons, to offer retrospective candles--saints that, after the manner of many saints,
were once such charming sinners for our sakes, that utter forgetfulness of them were an impious
boorishness surely unacceptable to the most jealous of Madonnas.

So I, seated in my haunted restaurant, brought the burnt offerings of several cigars, and poured
out various libations to my own private Gillians and Marians, and in fancy sat and looked into
Angelica's eyes at this table, and caressed Myrtle's opaled hand at that, and read Sylvia a
poem I had just written for her at still another. "Whose names are five sweet symphonies,"
wrote Rossetti. Yes, symphonies, indeed, in the ears of memory are the names of the lightest
loves that flittered butterfly-like across our path in the golden summer of our lives, each
name calling up its human counterpart, with her own endearing personality distinguishing her
from all other girls, her way of smiling, her way of talking, her way of being serious, all
the little originalities on which she prided herself, her so solemnly held differentia of tastes
and manners--all, in a word, that made you realize that you were dining with Corinna and not
with Chloe. What a service of contrast each--all unwittingly, need one say--did the other,
just in the same fashion as contrasting colours accentuate the special quality one of the other.
To have dined last night with Amaryllis, with her Titian red hair and green eyes, her tropic
languor and honey-drowsy ways, was to feel all the keener zest in the presence of Callithoe
on the following evening, with her delicate soul-lit face, and eager responsiveness of look
and gesture--blonde cendré, and fausse maigre--a being one of the hot noon, the other a creature
of the starlight. But I disclaim the sultanesque savour of thus writing of these dear bearers
of symphonic names. To talk of them as flowers and fruit, as colour and perfume, as ivory and
velvet, is to seem to forget the best of them, and the best part of loving them and being loved
again; for that consisted in their comradeship, their enchanted comradeship, the sense of shared
adventure, the snatching of a fearful joy together. For a little while we had escaped from
the drab and songless world, and, cost what it might, we were determined to take possession,
for a while at least, of that paradise which sprang into existence at the moment when "male
and female created He them." Such divine foolishness, let discretion warn, or morality frown,
or society play the censorious hypocrite, "were wisdom in the scorn of consequence."

"Ah, then," says every man to himself of such hours, as I said to myself in my haunted restaurant--"ah,
then came in the sweet o' the year."

But lovely and pleasant as were the memories over which I thus sat musing, there was one face
immeasurably beyond all others that I had come there hoping and yet fearing to meet again,
hers of whom for years that seem past counting all the awe and wonder and loveliness of the
world have seemed but the metaphor. Endless years ago she and I had sat at this table where
I was now sitting and had risen from it with breaking hearts, never to see each other's face,
hear each other's voice again. Voluntarily, for another's sake, we were breaking our hearts,
renouncing each other, putting from us all the rapture and religion of our loving, dying then
and there that another might live--vain sacrifice! Once and again, long silences apart, a word
or two would wing its way across lands and seas and tell us both that we were still under the
same sky and were still what nature had made us from the beginning--each other's. But long
since that veil of darkness unpierced of my star has fallen between us, and no longer do I
hear the rustle of her gown in the autumn woods, nor do the spring winds carry me the sweetness
of her faithful thoughts any more. So I dreamed maybe that, after the manner of phantoms, we
might meet again on the spot where we had both died--but alas, though the wraiths of lighter
loving came gaily to my call, she of the starlit silence and the tragic eyes came not, though
I sat long awaiting her--sat on till the tables began to be deserted, and the interregnum between
dinner and after-theatre supper had arrived. No, I began to understand that she could no longer
come to me: we must both wait till I could go to her.

And with this thought in my mind, I set about preparing to take my leave, but at that moment
I was startled--almost superstitiously--startled by a touch on my shoulder. I was not to leave
those once familiar halls without one recognition, after all. It was our old waiter of all
those years ago, who, with an almost paternal gladness, was telling me how good it was to see
me again, and, with consolatory mendacity, was assuring me that I had hardly changed a bit.
God bless him--he will never know what good it did me to have his honest recognition. The whole
world was not yet quite dead and buried, after all, nor was I quite such an unremembered ghost
as I had seemed. Dear old Jim Lewis! So some of the old guard were still on deck, after all!
And, I was thinking as I looked at him: "He, too, has looked upon her face. He it was who poured
out our wine, that last time together." Then I had a whim. My waiter had been used to them
in the old days.

"Jim," I said, "I want you to give this half-sovereign to the bandmaster and ask him to play
Chopin's Funeral March. There are not many people in the place, so perhaps he won't mind. Tell
him it's for an old friend of yours, and in memory of all the happy dinners he had here long ago."

So to the strains of that death music, which so strangely blends the piercing pathos of lost
things with a springlike sense of resurrection, a spheral melody of immortal promise, I passed
once more through the radiant portals of my necropolitan restaurant into the resounding thoroughfares
of still living and still loving humanity.

XIX

THE NEW PYRAMUS AND THISBE

There never was a shallower or more short-sighted criticism than that which has held that science
is the enemy of romance. Ruskin, with all the April showers of his rhetoric, discredited himself
as an authoritative thinker when he screamed his old-maidish diatribes against that pioneer
of modern romantic communication, the railroad. Just as surely his idol Turner proved himself
a romantic painter, not by his rainbows, or his Italian sunsets, but by that picture of Storm,
Rain, and Speed--an old-fashioned express fighting its way through wind, rain, and of course
rainbows--in the English National Gallery.

With all his love of that light that never was on sea or land, Turner was yet able to see the
romance of that new thing of iron and steam so affrighting to other men of his generation.
A lover of light in all its swift prismatic changes, he was naturally a lover of speed. He
realized that speed was one of the two most romantic things in the world. The other is immobility.
At present the two extremes of romantic expression are the Sphinx and--the automobile. Unless
you can realize that an automobile is more romantic than a stage-coach, you know nothing about
romance. Soon the automobile will have its nose put out by the air-ship, and we shall not need
to be long-lived to see the day when we shall hear old-timers lamenting the good old easy-going
past of the seventy-miles-an-hour automobile--just as we have heard our grand-fathers talk
of postilions and the Bath "flyer."

Romance is made of two opposites: Change, and That Which Changeth Not. In spite of foolish
sentimentalism, who needs be told that love is one of those forces of the universe that is
the same yesterday, today, and forever--the same today as when Dido broke her heart, as when
Leander swam the Hellespont? Gravitation is not more inherent in the cosmic scheme, nor fire
nor water more unchangeable in their qualities.

But Love, contrary to the old notion that he is unpractical, is a business-like god, and is
ever on the lookout for the latest modern appliances that can in anyway serve his purposes.
True love is far from being old-fashioned. On the contrary, true love is always up-to-date.
True love has its telephone, its phonograph, its automobile, and soon it will have its air-ship.
In the telephone alone what a debt love owes to its supposed enemy, modern science! One wonders
how lovers in the old days managed to live at all without the telephone.

We often hear how our modern appliances wear upon our nerves. But think how the lack of modern
appliances must have worn upon the nerves of our forefathers, and particularly our foremothers!
Think what distance meant in the Middle Ages, when the news of a battle took days to travel,
though carried by the swiftest horses. Horses! Think again of news being carried by--horses!
And once more think, with a prayer of gratitude to two magicians named Edison and Bell, and
with a due sense of your being the spoiled and petted offspring of the painful ages, that should
your love be in Omaha this night and you in New York City, you can say good-night to her through
the wall of your apartment, and hear her sigh back her good-night to you across two thousand
miles of the American flag. Or should your love be on the sea, you can interrupt her flirtations
all the way across with your persistent wireless conversation. Contrast your luxurious communicativeness
with the case of the lovers of old-time. Say that you have just married a young woman, and
you are happy together in your castle in the heart of the forest. Suddenly the courier of war
is at your gates, and you must up and arm and away with your men to the distant danger. You
must follow the Cross into the savage Kingdom of the Crescent. The husband must become the
crusader, and the Lord Christ alone knows when he shall look on the child's face of his wife
again. Through goblin-haunted wildernesses he must go, through unmapped no-man's lands, and
vacuum solitudes of the world's end, and peril and pestilence meet in every form, the face
of his foe the friendliest thing in all his mysterious travel. Not a pay-station as yet in
all the wide world, and fully five hundred years to the nearest telegraph office!

And think of the young wife meanwhile, alone with her maids and her tapestry in the dank isolation
of her lonely, listening castle. Not a leaf falls in the wood, but she hears it. Not a footstep
snaps the silence, but her eyes are at the sleepless slit of light which is her window in the
armoured stone of her fortified bridal tower. The only news of her husband she can hope for
in a full year or more will be the pleasing lies of some flattering minstrel, or broken soldier,
or imaginative pilgrim. On such rumours she must feed her famishing heart--and all the time
her husband's bones may be whitening unepitaphed outside the walls of Ascalon or Joppa.

There is an old Danish ballad which quaintly tells the tale of such old long-distance days,
with that blending of humour and pathos that forever goes to the heart of man. A certain Danish
lord had but yesterday taken unto himself a young wife, and on the morrow of his marriage there
came to him the summons to war. Then, as now, there was no arguing with the trumpets of martial
duty. The soldier's trumpet heeds not the soldier's tears. The war was far away and likely
to be long. Months, even years, might go by before that Danish lord would look on the face
of his bride again. So much might happen meanwhile! A little boy, or a little girl, might be
born to the castle, and the father, fighting far away, know nothing of the beautiful news.
And there was no telephone in the castle, and it was five hundred years to the nearest telegraph
office.

So the husband and wife agreed upon a facetious signal of their own. The castle stood upon
a ridge of hills which could be seen fifty miles away, and on the ridge the bride promised
to build a church. If the child that was to be born proved to be a boy, the church would be
builded with a tower; if a girl, with a steeple. So the husband went his way, and three years
passed, and at length he returned with his pennons and his men-at-arms to his own country.
Scanning the horizon line, he hurried impatiently toward the heliographic ridge. And lo! when
at last it came in sight against the rising sun, there was a new church builded stately there--with
two towers.

So it was with the most important of all news in the Middle Ages; and yet today, as I said,
you in New York City have only to knock good-night on your wall, to be heard by your true love
in Omaha, and hear her knock back three times the length of France; Pyramus and Thisbe--with
this difference: that the wall is no longer a barrier, but a sensitive messenger. It has become,
indeed, in the words of Demetrius in A Midsummer Night's Dream, the wittiest of partitions,
and the modern Pyramus may apostrophize it in grateful earnest:

          "Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall ...
          Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this!"

So at least I always feel toward the wall of my apartment every time I call up her whom my
soul loveth that dwelleth far away in Massachusetts. She being a Capulet and I a Montague,
it would go hard with us for communication, were it not for this long-distance wall; and any
one who knows anything of love knows that the primal need of lovers is communication. Lovers
have so deep a distrust of each other's love that they need to be assured of it from hour to
hour. To the philosopher it may well seem strange that this certitude should thus be in need
of progressive corroboration. But so it is, and the pampered modern lover may well wonder how
his great-grandfather and great-grandmother supported the days, or even kept their love alive,
on such famine rations as a letter once a month. A letter once a month! They must have had
enormous faith in each other, those lovers of old-time, or they must have suffered as we can
hardly bear to think of--we, who write to each other twice a day, telegraph three times, telephone
six, and transmit a phonographic record of our sighs to each other night and morn. The telephone
has made a toy of distance and made of absence, in many cases, a sufficient presence. It is
almost worth while to be apart on occasion just for the sake of bringing each other so magically
near. It is the Arabian Nights come true. As in them, you have only to say a word, and the
jinn of the electric fire is waiting for your commands. The word has changed. Once it was "Abracadabra."
Now it is "Central." But the miracle is just the same.

One might almost venture upon the generalization that most tragedies have come about from lack
of a telephone. Of course, there are exceptions, but as a rule tragedies happen through delays
in communication.

If there had been a telephone in Mantua, Romeo would never have bought poison of the apothecary.
Instead, he would have asked leave to use his long-distance telephone. Calling up Verona, he
would first cautiously disguise his voice. If, as usual, the old nurse answered, all well;
but if a bearded voice set all the wires a-trembling, he would, of course, hastily ring off,
and abuse "Central" for giving him the wrong number. And "Central" would understand. Then Romeo
would wait an hour or two till he was sure that Lord Capulet had gone to the Council, and ring
up again. This time he would probably get the nurse and confide to her his number in Mantua.
Next morning Juliet and her nurse had only to drop in at the nearest drug store, and confide
to Romeo the whole plot which Balthazar so sadly bungled. All that was needed was a telephone,
and Romeo would have understood that Juliet was only feigning death for the sake of life with
him. Another point in this tragedy is worth considering by the modern mind: that not only would
the final catastrophe have been averted by the telephone, but that those beautiful speeches
to and from Juliet's balcony, made at such desperate risk to both lovers, had the telephone
only been in existence, could have been made in complete security from the seclusion of their
distant apartments.

Seriously speaking, there are few love tragedies, few serious historic crises of any kind,
that might not have been averted by the telephone. Strange indeed, when one considers a little,
is that fallacy of sentimentalism which calls science the enemy of love.

Far from being its enemy, science is easily seen to be its most romantic servant; for all its
strenuous and delicate learning it brings to the feet of love for a plaything. Not only will
it carry the voice of love across space and time, but it will even bring it back to you from
eternity. It will not only carry to your ears the voices of the living, but it will also keep
safe for you the sweeter voices of the dead. In fact, it would almost seem as though science
had made all its discoveries for the sake of love.

TWO WONDERFUL OLD LADIES

It is a pity that our language has no other word to indicate that one has lived seventy, eighty,
or ninety years, than the word "old"; for the word "old" carries with it implications of "senility"
and decrepitude, which many merely chronologically "old" people very properly resent. The word
"young," similarly, needs the assistance of another word, for we all know individuals of thirty
and forty, sometimes even only twenty, whom it is as absurd to call "young" as it is to call
those others of seventy, eighty, or ninety, "old."

"Youth" is too large and rich a word to serve the limited purpose of numbering the years of
undeveloped boys and girls. It should stand rather for the vital principle in men and women,
ever expanding, and rebuilding, and refreshing the human organism, partly a physical, but perhaps
in a greater degree a spiritual energy.

I am not writing this out of any compliment to two wonderful "old" ladies of whom I am particularly
thinking. They would consider me a dunce were they to suspect me of any such commonplace intent.
No! I am not going to call them "eighty years young," or employ any of those banal euphemisms
with which would-be "tactful" but really club-footed sentimentalists insult the intelligence
of the so-called "old." Of course, I know that they are both eighty or thereabouts, and they
know very well that I know. We make no secret of it. Why should we? Actually though the number
of my years falls short of eighty, I feel so much older than either of them, that it never
occurs to me to think of them as "old," and often as I contemplate their really glowing energetic
youth, I grow melancholy for myself, and wonder what has become of my own.

They were schoolgirls together. Luccia married Irene's brother--for they allow me the privilege
of calling them by their Christian names--and they have been friends all their lives. Sometimes
I see them together, though oftener apart, for Luccia and her white-haired poet husband--no
"older" than herself,--are neighbours of mine in the country, and Irene lives for the most
part in New York--as much in love with its giant developments as though she did not also cherish
memories of that quaint, almost vanished, New York of her girlhood days; for she is nothing
if not progressive.

But I will tell about Luccia first, and the first thing it is natural to speak of--so every
one else finds too--is her beauty. They say that she was beautiful when she was young (I am
compelled sometimes, under protest, to use the words "young" and "old" thus chronologically)
and, of course, she must have been. I have, however, seen some of her early portraits, before
her hair was its present beautiful colour, and I must confess that the Luccia of an earlier
day does not compare with the Luccia of today. I don't think I should have fallen in love with
her then, whereas now it is impossible to take one's eyes off her. She seems to have grown
more flower-like with the years, and while her lovely indestructible profile has gathered distinction,
and a lifelong habit of thinking beautiful thoughts, and contemplating beautiful things, has
drawn honeyed lines as in silver point about her eyes and mouth, the wild-roses of her cheeks
still go on blooming--like wild-roses in moonlight. And over all glow her great clear witty
eyes, the eyes of a grand dame who has still remained a girl. Her humour, no doubt, has much
to do with her youth, and I have seen strangers no little surprised, even disconcerted, at
finding so keen a humour in one so beautiful; for beauty and humour are seldom found together
in so irresistible a combination. Is it to be wondered at that often on summer days when I
feel the need of a companion, I go in search of Luccia, and take tea with her on the veranda?
Sometimes I will find her in the garden seated in front of her easel, making one of her delicate
water-colour sketches--for she was once a student in Paris and has romantic Latin-quarter memories.
Or I will find her with her magnifying glass, trying to classify some weed she has come upon
in the garden, for she is a learned botanist; and sometimes we will turn over the pages of
books in which she hoards the pressed flowers gathered by her and her husband in Italy and
Switzerland up till but a year or two ago, memorials of a life together that has been that
flawless romance which love sometimes grants to his faithful servants.

At other times we will talk politics, and I wish you could hear the advanced views of this
"old" lady of eighty. Indeed, generally speaking, I find that nowadays the only real progressives
are the "old" people. It seems to be the fashion with the "young" to be reactionary. Luccia,
however, has been a radical and a rebel since her girlhood, and, years before the word "feminist"
was invented, was fighting the battle of the freedom of woman. And what a splendid Democrat
she is, and how thoroughly she understands and fearlessly faces the problems and developments
of the moment! She is of the stuff the old Chartist women and the women of the French Revolution
were made of, and in her heart the old faith in Liberty and the people burns as brightly as
though she were some young Russian student ready to give her life for the cause. When the revolution
comes to America, stern masculine authority will be needed to keep her--her friend Irene too--from
the barricades.

"Stern masculine authority"! As I write that phrase, how plainly I can hear her mocking laughter;
for she is never more delightful than when pouring out her raillery on the magisterial pretensions
of man. To hear her talk! The idea of a mere man daring to assume any authority or direction
over a woman! Yet we who know her smile and whisper to ourselves that, for all her witty tirades,
she is perhaps of all women the most feminine, and really the most "obedient" of wives--a rebel
in all else save to the mild tyranny of the poet she has loved, honoured, and yes! obeyed,
all these wonderful years.

Perhaps in nothing is the reality of her youthfulness so expressive as in her adorable gaiety.
Like a clear fresh spring, it is ever brimming up from the heart into her mischief-loving eyes.
By her side merely technically young people seem heavy and serious. And nothing amuses her
more than gravely to mystify, or even bewilderingly shock, some proper acquaintance, or some
respectable strangers, with her carefully designed mock improprieties of speech or action.
To look at the loveliest of grand-mothers, it is naturally somewhat perplexing to the uninitiated
visitor to hear her talk, with her rarely distinguished manner, of frivolous matters with which
they assume she has long since done.

A short while ago, when I was taking tea with her, she had for visitor a staid old-maidish
lady, little more than half her age, whom she had known as a girl, but had not seen for some
years. In the course of conversation, she turned to her guest, with her grand air:

"Have you done much dancing this season?" she asked.

"O indeed no," answered the other unsuspiciously, "my dancing days are over."

"At your age!" commented Luccia with surprise. "Nonsense! You must let me teach you to dance
the tango. I have enjoyed it immensely this winter."

"Really?" gasped the other in astonishment, with that intonation in the voice naturally so
gratifying to the "old" suggesting that the person talking with them really regards them as
dead and buried.

"Of course, why not?" asks Luccia with perfect seriousness. "I dance it with my grandsons.
My husband doesn't care to dance it. He prefers the polka."

Not knowing what to think, the poor old maid--actually "old" compared with Luccia--looked from
her to the beautiful venerable figure of her polka-dancing husband seemingly meditating over
his pipe, a little withdrawn from them on the veranda, but inwardly shaken with mirth at the
darling nonsense of her who is still the same madcap girl he first fell in love with so many
years ago.

When the guest had departed, with a puzzled, questioning look still lingering on her face,
Luccia turned to me, her eyes bright pools of merriment:

"It was quite true, wasn't it? Come, let us try it."

And, nimble as a girl, she was on her feet, and we executed quite a passable tango up and down
the veranda, to the accompaniment of her husband's--"Luccia! Luccia! what a wild thing you are!"

A certain reputation for "wildness," a savour of innocent Bohemianism, has clung to Luccia,
and Irene too, all through their lives, as a legacy from that far-off legendary time when,
scarcely out of their girlhood, they were fellow art-students together in Paris. Belonging
both to aristocratic, rather straitlaced New England families, I have often wondered how they
contrived to accomplish that adventure in a day when such independent action on the part of
two pretty young ladies was an adventure indeed. But it was the time when the first vigorous
spring of feminine revolt was in the air. Rosa Bonheur, George Eliot, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
and other leaders were setting the pace for the advanced women, and George Sand was still a
popular romancer. As a reminiscence of George Sand, Luccia to this day pretends that she prefers
to smoke cigars to cigarettes, though, as a matter of fact, she has never smoked either, and
has, indeed, an ultra-feminine detestation of tobacco--even in the form of her husband's pipe.
She only says it, of course, for the fun of seeming "naughty"; which recalls to my mind her
shocking behaviour one day when I went with her to call on some very prim cousins in New York.
It was a household of an excessively brown-stone respectability, just the atmosphere to rouse
the wickedness in Luccia. As we sat together in an upright conversation that sounded like the
rustling of dried leaves in a cemetery, why! Luccia, for all her eighty years, seemed like
a young wild-rose bush filling the tomb-like room with living light and fragrance. I could
see the wickedness in her surging for an outburst. She was well aware that those respectable
connections of hers had always looked upon her as a sort of "artistic" black sheep in the family.
Presently her opportunity came. As our visit dragged mournfully towards its end, the butler
entered, in pursuance of the early Victorian ritual on such occasions, bearing a tray on which
was a decanter of sherry, some tiny wine-glasses, and some dry biscuits of a truly early Victorian
dryness. This ghostly hospitality was duly dispensed, and Luccia, who seldom drinks anything
but tea, instead of sipping her sherry with a lady-like aloofness, drained her glass with a
sudden devil-may-care abandon, and, to the evident amazement even of the furniture, held it
out to be refilled. Such pagan behaviour had never disgraced that scandalized drawing-room
before. And when to her action she added words, the room absolutely refused to believe its
ears. "I feel," she said, with a deep-down mirth in her eyes which only I could suspect rather
than see, "I feel today as if I should like to go on a real spree. Do you ever feel that way?"

A palpable shudder passed through the room.

"Cousin Luccia!" cried out the three outraged mummies; the brother with actual sternness, and
the sisters in plain fear. Had their eccentric cousin really gone out of her mind at last?

"Never feel that way?" she added, delighting in the havoc she was making. "You should. It's
a wonderful feeling."

Then she drained her second glass, and to the evident relief of all three, rose to go. How
we laughed together, as we sped away in our taxicab. "It's as well to live up to one's reputation
with such people," she said, that dear, fantastic Luccia.

À propos that early Parisian adventure, Rosa Bonheur had been one of Luccia's and Irene's great
exemplars, and one might say, in one particular connection,--heroes. I refer to the great painter's
adoption of masculine costume. Why two unusually pretty young women should burn to discard
the traditional flower-furniture of their sex, in exchange for the uncouth envelopes of man,
is hard to understand. But it was the day of Mrs. Bloomer, as well as Rosa Bonheur; and earnest
young "intellectuals" among women had a notion, I fancy, that to shake off their silks and
laces was, symbolically, at all events, to shake off the general disabilities of their sex,
and was somehow an assertion of a mental equality with man. At all events, it was a form of
defiance against their sex's immemorial tyrant, which seems to have appealed to the imaginations
of some young women of the period. Another woman's weakness to be sternly discarded was that
scriptural "glory" of her hair. That must be ruthlessly lopped. So it is easy to imagine the
horror of such relatives as I have hinted at when our two beautiful adventuresses returned
from Paris, and appeared before their families in great Spanish cloaks, picturesque, coquettish
enough you may be sure, veiling with some show of discretion those hideous compromises with
trousers invented and worn by the strong-minded Mrs. Bloomer, and wearing their hair after
the manner of Florentine boys. To face one's family, and to walk New York streets so garbed,
must have needed real courage in those days; yet the two friends did both, and even for a while
accepted persecution for vagaries which for them had the dead-seriousness of youth.

Passionate young propagandists as they were, they even preferred to abandon their homes for
a while--rather than their bloomers--and, taking a studio together in New York, started out
to earn their own living by the teaching of art. Those were the days of the really brave women.

But to return to the less abstract topic of the bloomers, I often tease Luccia and Irene about
them, seeking for further information as to why they ever came to retrograde from a position
so heroically taken, one of such serious import to human progress, and to condescend once more
to don the livery of feminine servitude, and appear, as they do today, in delicate draperies
which the eye searches in vain for any hint of sanguinary revolution. Luccia always looks shamefaced
at the question. She still feels guilty, I can see, of a traitorous backsliding and occasionally
threatens to make up for it by a return to masculine costume--looking the most exquisite piece
of Dresden china as she says it. I have seen that masculine tyrant of hers smiling knowingly
to himself on such occasions, and it has not been difficult to guess why and when those historic
bloomers disappeared into the limbo of lost causes. There is little doubt that when Love came
in by the door, the bloomers went out, so to speak, by the window.

Irene seems to have held out longer, and, doubtless, scornful of her more frivolous comrade's
defection, steadfastly kept the faith awhile unsupported, walking the world in bloomered loneliness--till
a like event overtook her. Such is the end of every maid's revolt! But Irene, to this day,
retains more of her student seriousness than her more worldly-minded friend. Her face is of
the round cherubic type, and her large heavy-lidded eyes have a touch of demureness veiling
humour no less deep than Luccia's, but more reflective, chuckling quietly to itself, though
on occasion I know no one better to laugh with, even giggle with, than Irene. *****]********** old something.

But the beauty of winter seems a spiritual, almost a supernatural, thing, austere and forbidding
at first, but on a nearer approach found to be rich in exquisite exhilaration, in rare and
lofty discoveries and satisfactions of the soul. Winter naturally has found less favour with
the poets than the other seasons. Praise of it has usually a strained air, as though the poet
were making the best of a barren theme, like a portrait-painter reluctantly flattering some
unattractive sitter. But one poet has seen and seized the mysterious beauty of winter with
unforced sympathy--Coventry Patmore, whose "Odes," in particular, containing as they do some
of the most rarely spiritual meditation in English poetry, are all too little known. In one
of these he has these beautiful lines, which I quote, I hope correctly, from memory:

          I, singularly moved
          To love the lovely that are not beloved,
          Of all the seasons, most love winter, and to trace
          The sense of the Trophonian pallor of her face.
          It is not death, but plenitude of peace;
          And this dim cloud which doth the earth enfold
          Hath less the characters of dark and cold
          Than light and warmth asleep,
          And intermittent breathing still doth keep
          With the infant harvest heaving soft below
          Its eider coverlet of snow.

The beauty of winter is like the beauty of certain austere classics of literature and art,
and as with them, also, it demands a certain almost moral strenuousness of application before
it reveals itself. The loftiest masterpieces have something aloof and cheerless about them
at our first approach, something of the cold breath of those starry spaces into which they
soar, and to which they uplift our spirits. When we first open Dante or Milton, we miss the
flowers and the birds and the human glow of the more sensuous and earth-dwelling poets. But
after awhile, after our first rather bleak introduction to them, we grow aware that these apparently
undecorated and unmusical masterpieces are radiant and resounding with a beauty and a music
which "eye hath not seen nor ear heard." For flowers we are given stars, for the song of birds
the music of the spheres, and for that human glow a spiritual ecstasy.

Similarly with winter. It has indeed a strange beauty peculiar to itself, but it is a beauty
we must be at some pains to enjoy. The beauty of the other seasons comes to us, offers itself
to us, without effort. To study the beauty of summer, it is enough to lie under green boughs
with half-closed eyes, and listen to the running stream and the murmur of a million wings.
But winter's is no such idle lesson. In summer we can hardly stay indoors, but in winter we
can hardly be persuaded to go out. We must gird ourselves to overcome that first disinclination,
else we shall know nothing of winter but its churlish wind and its ice-in-the-pail. But, the
effort made, and once out of doors on a sunlit winter's morning, how soon are we finding out
the mistake we were making, coddling ourselves in the steam-heat! Indoors, indeed, the prospect
had its Christmas-card picturesqueness; snow-clad roofs, snow-laden boughs, silhouetted tracery
of leafless trees; but we said that it was a soulless spectacular display, the beauty of death,
and the abhorred coldness thereof. We have hardly walked a hundred yards, however, before impressions
very different are crowding upon us, among which the impression of cold is forgotten, or only
retained as pleasantly heightening the rest.

Far from the world's being dead, as it had seemed indoors, we are presently, in some strange
indefinable way, made intensely conscious of a curious overwhelming sense of life in the air,
as though the crystal atmosphere was, so to say, ecstatically charged with the invisible energy
of spiritual forces. In the enchanted stillness of the snow, we seem to hear the very breathing
of the spirit of life. The cessation of all the myriad little sounds that rise so merrily and
so musically from the summer surface of the earth seems to allow us to hear the solemn beat
of the very heart of earth itself. We seem very near to the sacred mystery of being, nearer
than at any other season of the year, for in other seasons we are distracted by its pleasurable
phenomena, but in winter we seem close to the very mystery itself; for the world seems to have
put on robes of pure spirit and ascended into a diviner ether.

The very phenomena of winter have a spiritual air which those of summer lack, a phantom-like
strangeness. How mysterious this ice, how ghostly this snow, and all the beautiful fantastic
shapes taken by both; the dream-like foliage, and feathers and furs of the snow, the Gothic
diablerie of icicled eaves, all the fairy fancies of the frost, the fretted crystal shapes
that hang the brook-side with rarer than Venetian glass, the strange flowers that stealthily
overlay the windows, even while we watch in vain for the unseen hand! No flowers of summer
seem so strange as these, make us feel so weirdly conscious of the mystery of life. As the
ghostly artist covers the pane, is it not as though a spirit passed?

As we walk on through the shining morning, we ourselves seem to grow rarefied as the air. Our
senses seem to grow finer, purged to a keener sensitiveness. Our eyes and ears seem to become
spiritual rather than physical organs, and an exquisite elation, as though we were walking
on shining air, or winging through celestial space, fills all our being. The material earth
and our material selves seem to grow joyously transparent, and while we are conscious of our
earthly shoe-leather ringing out on the iron-bound highway, we seem, nevertheless, to be spirits
moving without effort, in a world of spirit. Seldom, if ever, in summer are we thus made conscious
of, so to say, our own ghosts, thus lifted up out of our material selves with a happy sense
of disembodiment.

There would, indeed, seem to be some relation between temperature and the soul, and something
literally purifying about cold. Certain it is that we return from our winter's walk with something
sacred in our hearts and something shining in our faces, which we seldom, if ever, bring back
with us in summer. Without understanding the process, we seem to have been brought nearer to
the invisible mystery, and a solemn peace of happy insight seems for a little while at least
to possess our souls. Our white walk in the snow-bright air has in some way quickened the half-torpid
immortal within us, revived awhile our sluggish sense of our spiritual significance and destiny,
made us once more, if only for a little, attractively mysterious to ourselves. Yes! there is
what one might call a certain monastic discipline about winter which impels the least spiritual
minded to meditation on his mortal lot and its immortal meanings; and thus, as I said, the
Church has done wisely to choose winter for its most Christian festival. The heart of man,
thus prepared by the very elements, is the more open to the message of the miraculous love,
and the more ready to translate it into terms of human goodness. And thus, I hope, the ghostly
significance of mince-pie is made clear.

But enough of ghostly, grown-up thoughts. Let us end with a song for the children:

          O the big red sun,
            And the wide white world,
          And the nursery window
            Mother-of-pearled;

          And the houses all
            In hoods of snow,
          And the mince-pies,
            And the mistletoe;

          And Christmas pudding,
            And berries red,
          And stockings hung
            At the foot of the bed;

          And carol-singers,
            And nothing but play--
          O baby, this is
            Christmas Day!

ON RE-READING WALTER PATER

It is with no small satisfaction, and with a sense of reassurance of which one may, in moods
of misgiving, have felt the need during two decades of the Literature of Noise, that one sees
a writer so pre-eminently a master of the Literature of Meditation coming, for all the captains
and the shouting, so surely into his own. The acceptance of Walter Pater is not merely widening
all the time, but it is more and more becoming an acceptance such as he himself would have
most valued, an acceptance in accordance with the full significance of his work rather than
a one-sided appreciation of some of its Corinthian characteristics. The Doric qualities of
his work are becoming recognized also, and he is being read, as he has always been read by
his true disciples--so not inappropriately to name those who have come under his graver spell--not
merely as a prosateur of purple patches, or a sophist of honeyed counsels tragically easy to
misapply, but as an artist of the interpretative imagination of rare insight and magic, a writer
of deep humanity as well as aesthetic beauty, and the teacher of a way of life at once ennobling
and exquisite. It is no longer possible to parody him--after the fashion of Mr. Mallock's brilliancy
in The New Republic--as a writer of "all manner and no matter," nor is it possible any longer
to confuse his philosophy with those gospels of unrestrained libertinism which have taken in
vain the name of Epicurus. His highly wrought, sensitively coloured, and musically expressive
style is seen to be what it is because of its truth to a matter profound and delicate and intensely
meditated, and such faults as it has come rather of too much matter than too little; while
his teaching, far from being that of a facile "Epicureanism," is seen, properly understood,
to involve something like the austerity of a fastidious Puritanism, and to result in a jealous
asceticism of the senses rather than in their indulgence. "Slight as was the burden of positive
moral obligation with which he had entered Rome," he writes of Marius, as on his first evening
in Rome the murmur comes to him of "the lively, reckless call to 'play,' from the sons and
daughters of foolishness," "it was to no wasteful and vagrant affections, such as these, that
his Epicureanism had committed him." Such warnings against misunderstanding Pater is careful
to place, at, so to say, all the cross-roads in his books, so scrupulously concerned is he
lest any reader should take the wrong turning. Few writers, indeed, manifest so constant a
consideration for, and, in minor matters, such a sensitive courtesy toward, their readers,
while in matters of conscience Pater seems to feel for them an actual pastoral responsibility.
His well-known withdrawal of the "Conclusion" to The Renaissance from its second edition, from
a fear that "it might possibly mislead some of those young men into whose hands it might fall,"
is but one of many examples of his solicitude; and surely such as have gone astray after such
painstaking guidance have but their own natures to blame.

That Pater's philosophy could ever have been misunderstood is not to be entertained with patience
by any one who has read him with even ordinary attention; that it may have been misapplied,
in spite of all his care, is, of course, possible; but if a writer is to be called to account
for all the misapplications, or distortions, of his philosophy, writing may as well come to
an end. Yet, inconceivable as it may sound, a critic very properly held in popular esteem recently
gave it as his opinion that the teaching of Walter Pater was responsible for the tragic career
of the author of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Certainly that remarkable man was an "epicurean"--but
one, to quote Meredith, "whom Epicurus would have scourged out of his garden"; and the statement
made by the critic in question that The Renaissance is the book referred to in The Picture
of Dorian Gray as having had a sinister influence over its hero is so easily disposed of by
a reference to that romance itself that it is hard to understand its ever having been made.
Here is the passage describing the demoralizing book in question:

    His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.... It
    was the strangest book he had ever read. It seemed to him that in
    exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of
    the world were passing in dumb show before him. Things that he had
    dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him. Things of which he
    had never dreamed were gradually revealed.

    It was a novel without a plot, and with only one character, being,
    indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who
    spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the
    passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except
    his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods
    through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their
    mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called
    virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call
    sin. The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled
    style, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms,
    of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that
    characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French
    school of Décandents. There were in it metaphors as monstrous as
    orchids, and as evil in colour. The life of the senses was described
    in the terms of mystical philosophy. One hardly knew at times
    whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some medieval
    saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner. It was a
    poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its
    pages and to trouble the brain. The mere cadence of the sentences,
    the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex
    refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of
    the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a
    malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and
    the creeping shadows....

    For years Dorian Gray could not free himself from the memory of this
    book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never
    sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than
    five large paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in
    different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the
    changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have
    almost entirely lost control.

The book thus characterized is obviously by a French writer--I have good reason for thinking
that it was À Rebours by Huysmans--and how any responsible reader can have imagined that Walter
Pater's The Renaissance answers to this description passes all understanding. A critic guilty
of so patent a misstatement must either never have read The Picture of Dorian Gray, or never
have read The Renaissance. On the other hand, if on other more reliable evidence it can be
found that Oscar Wilde was one of those "young men" misled by Pater's book, for whose spiritual
safety Pater, as we have seen, was so solicitous, one can only remind oneself again of the
phrase quoted above in regard to "that soil of human nature" into which a writer casts his
seed. If that which was sown a lily comes up a toadstool, there is evidently something wrong
with the soil.

Now, if it be true that the application, or rather the misapplication, of this philosophy led
Oscar Wilde to Reading Gaol, it is none the less true that another application of it led Marius
to something like Christian martyrdom, and Walter Pater himself along an ever loftier and serener
path of spiritual vision.

Nothing short of wilful misconstruction can make of the counsel thus offered, with so priestly
a concern that the writer's exact meaning be brought home to his reader, other than an inspiration
toward a noble employment of that mysterious opportunity we call life. For those of us, perhaps
more than a few, who have no assurance of the leisure of an eternity for idleness or experiment,
this expansion and elevation of the doctrine of the moment, carrying a merely sensual and trivial
moral in the Horatian maxim of carpe diem, is one thrillingly charged with exhilaration and
sounding a solemn and yet seductive challenge to us to make the most indeed, but also to make
the best, of our little day. To make the most, and to make the best of life! Those who misinterpret
or misapply Pater forget his constant insistence on the second half of that precept. We are
to get "as many pulsations as possible into the given time," but we are to be very careful
that our use of those pulsations shall be the finest. Whether or not it is "simply for those
moments' sake," our attempt must be to give "the highest quality," remember, to those "moments
as they pass." And who can fail to remark the fastidious care with which Pater selects various
typical interests which he deems most worthy of dignifying the moment? There is surely a great
gulf fixed between this lofty preoccupation with great human emotions and high spiritual and
intellectual excitements, and a vulgar gospel of "eat, drink, for tomorrow we die," whether
or not both counsels start out from a realization of "the awful brevity" of our mortal day.
That realization may prompt certain natures to unbridled sensuality. Doomed to perish as the
beasts, they choose, it would seem with no marked reluctance, to live the life of the beast,
a life apparently not without its satisfactions. But it is as stupid as it is infamous to pretend
that such natures as these find any warrant for their tragic libertinism in Walter Pater. They
may, indeed, have found aesthetic pleasure in the reading of his prose, but the truth of which
that prose is but the beautiful garment has passed them by. Such, too, was Pater's nature,
and such his practical usefulness as what one might call a philosophical artist. Meredith,
Emerson, Browning, and even Carlyle were artists so far related to him and each other in that
each of them wrought a certain optimism, or, at all events, a courageous and even blithe working
theory of life and conduct, out of the unrelenting facts of existence unflinchingly faced,
rather than ecclesiastically smoothed over--the facts of death and pain and struggle, and even
the cruel mystery that surrounds with darkness and terror our mortal lot. Each one of them
deliberately faced the worst, and with each, after his own nature, the worst returned to laughter.
The force of all these men was in their artistic or poetic embodiment of philosophical conceptions,
but, had they not been artists and poets, their philosophical conceptions would have made but
little way. And it is time to recall, what critics preoccupied with his "message" leave unduly
in the background, that Pater was an artist of remarkable power and fascination, a maker of
beautiful things, which, whatever their philosophical content, have for our spirits the refreshment
and edification which all beauty mysteriously brings us, merely because it is beauty. Marius
the Epicurean is a great and wonderful book, not merely on account of its teaching, but because
it is simply one of the most beautiful books, perhaps the most beautiful book, written in English.
It is beautiful in many ways. It is beautiful, first of all, in the uniquely personal quality
of its prose, prose which is at once austere and sensuous, simple at once and elaborate, scientifically
exact and yet mystically suggestive, cool and hushed as sanctuary marble, sweet-smelling as
sanctuary incense; prose that has at once the qualities of painting and of music, rich in firmly
visualized pictures, yet moving to subtle, half-submerged rhythms, and expressive with every
delicate accent and cadence; prose highly wrought, and yet singularly surprising one at times
with, so to say, sudden innocencies, artless and instinctive beneath all its sedulous art.
It is no longer necessary, as I hinted above, to fight the battle of this prose. Whether it
appeal to one not, no critic worth attention any longer disparages it as mere ornate and perfumed
verbiage, the elaborate mannerism of a writer hiding the poverty of his thought beneath a pretentious
raiment of decorated expression. It is understood to be the organic utterance of one with a
vision of the world all his own striving through words, as he best can, to make that vision
visible to others as nearly as possible as he himself sees it. Pater himself has expounded
his theory and practice of prose, doubtless with a side-thought of self-justification, in various
places up and down his writings, notably in his pregnant essay on "Style," and perhaps even
more persuasively in the chapter called "Euphuism" in Marius.

This striving to express the truth that is in him has resulted in a beauty of prose which for
individual quality must be ranked with the prose of such masters as De Quincey and Lamb, and,
to make a not irrelevant comparison, above the very fine prose of his contemporary Stevenson,
by virtue of its greater personal sincerity.

There is neither space here, nor need, to illustrate this opinion by quotation, though it may
not be amiss, the musical and decorative qualities of Pater's prose having been so generally
dwelt upon, to remind the reader of the magical simplicities by which it is no less frequently
characterized. What could be simpler than these brief sentences, yet how peculiarly suggestive
they are; what immediate pictures they make! And this magical simplicity is particularly successful
in his descriptive passages, notably of natural effects, effects caught with an instinctively
selected touch or two, an expressive detail, a grey or coloured word.

Those who judge of Pater's writing by a few purple passages such as the famous rhapsody on
the Mona Lisa, conceiving it as always thus heavy with narcotic perfume, know but one side
of him, and miss his gift for conveying freshness, his constant happiness in light and air
and particularly running water, "green fields--or children's faces." His lovely chapter on
the temple of Aesculapius seems to be made entirely of morning light, bubbling springs, and
pure mountain air; and the religious influence of these lustral elements is his constant theme.
For him they have a natural sacramental value, and it is through them and such other influences
that Pater seeks for his hero the sanctification of the senses and the evolution of the spirit.
In his preoccupation with them, and all things lovely to the eye and to the intelligence, it
is that the secret lies of the singular purity of atmosphere which pervades his Marius, an
atmosphere which might be termed the soul-beauty of the book, as distinct from its, so to say,
body-beauty as beautiful prose.

Considering Marius as a story, a work of imagination, one finds the same evocative method used
in the telling of it, and in the portrayal of character, as Pater employs in its descriptive
passages. Owing to certain violent, cinematographic methods of story-telling and character-drawing
to which we have become accustomed, it is too often assumed that stories cannot be told or
characters drawn in any other way. Actually, of course, as many an old masterpiece admonishes
us, there is no one canon in this matter, but, on the contrary, no limit to the variety of
method and manner a creative artist is at liberty to employ in his imaginative treatment of
human life. All one asks is that the work should live, the characters and scenes appear real
to us, and the story be told. And Pater's Marius entirely satisfies this demand for those to
whom such a pilgrimage of the soul will alone appeal. It is a real story, no mere German scholar's
attempt to animate the dry bones of his erudition; and the personages and the scenes do actually
live for us, as by some delicate magic of hint and suggestion; and, though at first they may
seem shadowy, they have a curious way of persisting, and, as it were, growing more and more
alive in our memories. The figure of Marcus Aurelius, for example, though so delicately sketched,
is a masterpiece of historical portraiture, as the pictures of Roman life, done with so little,
seem to me far more convincing than the like over-elaborated pictures of antiquity, so choked
with learned detail, of Flaubert and of Gautier. Swinburne's famous praise of Gautier's Mademoiselle
de Maupin applies with far greater fitness to Pater's masterpiece; for, if ever a book deserved
to be described as

          The golden book of spirit and sense,
          The holy writ of beauty,

it is Marius the Epicurean.

It has been natural to dwell so long on this "golden book," because Pater's various gifts are
concentrated in it, to make what is, of course, his masterpiece; though some one or other of
these gifts is to be found employed with greater mastery in other of his writings, notably
that delicate dramatic gift of embodying in a symbolic story certain subtle states of mind
and refinements of temperament which reaches its perfection in Imaginary Portraits, to which
the later "Apollo in Picardy" and "Hippolytus Veiled" properly belong. It is only necessary
to recall the exquisitely austere "Sebastian Van Storck" and the strangely contrasting Dionysiac
"Denys L'Auxerrois" to justify one's claim for Pater as a creative artist of a rare kind, with
a singular and fascinating power of incarnating a philosophic formula, a formula no less dry
than Spinoza's, or a mood of the human spirit, in living, breathing types and persuasive tragic
fables. This genius for creative interpretation is the soul and significance of all his criticism.
It gives their value to the studies of The Renaissance, but perhaps its finest flower is to
be found in the later Greek Studies. This same creative interpretation gives a like value to
his studies of Plato; and so by virtue of this gift, active throughout the ten volumes which
constitute his collected work, Pater proved himself to be of the company of the great humanists.

Along with all the other constituents of his work, its sacerdotalism, its subtle reverie, its
sensuous colour and perfume, its marmoreal austerity, its honeyed music, its frequent preoccupation
with the haunted recesses of thought, there go an endearing homeliness and simplicity, a deep
human tenderness, a gentle friendliness, a something childlike. He has written of her, "the
presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters," to whom all experience had been "but
as the sound of lyres and flutes," and he has written of "The Child in the House."

It is by virtue of this combination of humanity, edification, and aesthetic delight that Walter
Pater is unique among the great teachers and artists of our time.

THE MYSTERY OF "FIONA MACLEOD" [1]

    [1]William Sharp (Fiona Macleod). A Memoir, compiled
    by his wife, Elizabeth A. Sharp. (Duffield & Co.)
    The Writings of Fiona Macleod. Uniform edition. Arranged
    by Mrs. William Sharp. (Duffield & Co.)

In the fascinating memoir of her husband, which Mrs. William Sharp has written with so much
dignity and tact, and general biographic skill, she dwells with particular fondness of recollection
on the two years of their life at Phenice Croft, a charming cottage they had taken in the summer
of 1892 at Rudgwick in Sussex, seven miles from Horsham, the birthplace of Shelley. Still fresh
in my memory is a delightful visit I paid them there, and I was soon afterwards to recall with
special significance a conversation I had with Mrs. Sharp, as four of us walked out one evening
after dinner in a somewhat melancholy twilight, the glow-worms here and there trimming their
ghostly lamps by the wayside, and the nightjar churring its hoarse lovesong somewhere in the
thickening dusk.

"Will," Mrs. Sharp confided to me, was soon to have a surprise for his friends in a fuller
and truer expression of himself than his work had so far attained, but the nature of that expression
Mrs. Sharp did not confide--more than to hint that there were powers and qualities in her husband's
make-up that had hitherto lain dormant, or had, at all events, been but little drawn upon.

Mrs. Sharp was thus vaguely hinting at the future "Fiona Macleod," for it was at Rudgwick,
we learn, that that so long mysterious literary entity sprang into imaginative being with Pharais.
Pharais was published in 1894, and I remember that early copies of it came simultaneously to
myself and Grant Allen, with whom I was then staying, and how we were both somewhat intrigué
by a certain air of mystery which seemed to attach to the little volume. We were both intimate
friends of William Sharp, but I was better acquainted with Sharp's earlier poetry than Grant
Allen, and it was my detection in Pharais of one or two subtly observed natural images, the
use of which had previously struck me in one of his Romantic Ballads and Poems of Phantasy,
that brought to my mind in a flash of understanding that Rudgwick conversation with Mrs. Sharp,
and thus made me doubly certain that "Fiona Macleod" and William Sharp were one, if not the
same. Conceiving no reason for secrecy, and only too happy to find that my friend had fulfilled
his wife's prophecy by such fuller and finer expression of himself, I stated my belief as to
its authorship in a review I wrote for the London Star. My review brought me an urgent telegram
from Sharp, begging me, for God's sake, to shut my mouth--or words to that effect. Needless
to say, I did my best to atone for having thus put my foot in it, by a subsequent severe silence
till now unbroken; though I was often hard driven by curious inquirers to preserve the secret
which my friend afterwards confided to me.

When I say "confided to me," I must add that in the many confidences William Sharp made to
me on the matter, I was always aware of a reserve of fanciful mystification, and I am by no
means sure, even now, that I, or any of us--with the possible exception of Mrs. Sharp--know
the whole truth about "Fiona Macleod." Indeed it is clear from Mrs. Sharp's interesting revelations
of her husband's temperament that "the whole truth" could hardly be known even to William Sharp
himself; for, very evidently in "Fiona Macleod" we have to deal not merely with a literary
mystification, but with a psychological mystery. Here it is pertinent to quote the message
written to be delivered to certain of his friends after his death: "This will reach you," he
says, "after my death. You will think I have wholly deceived you about Fiona Macleod. But,
in an intimate sense this is not so, though (and inevitably) in certain details I have misled
you. Only, it is a mystery. I cannot explain. Perhaps you will intuitively understand or may
come to understand. 'The rest is silence.' Farewell. WILLIAM SHARP."

"It is only right, however, to add that I, and I only, was the author--in the literal and literary
sense--of all written under the name of 'Fiona Macleod.'"

"Only, it is a mystery. I cannot explain." Does "I cannot explain" mean "I must not explain,"
or merely just what it says? I am inclined to think it means both; but, if so, the "must not"
would refer to the purely personal mystification on which, of course, none would desire to
intrude, and the "cannot" would refer to that psychological mystery which we are at liberty
to investigate.

William Sharp's explanation to myself--as I believe to others of his friends--was to the same
tenor as this posthumous statement. He and he only had actually written the "Fiona Macleod"
fantasies and poems, but--yes! there was a real "Fiona Macleod" as well. She was a beautiful
cousin of his, living much in solitude and dreams, and seldom visiting cities. Between her
and him there was a singular spiritual kinship, which by some inexplicable process, so to say,
of psychic collaboration, had resulted in the writings to which he had given her name. They
were hers as well as his, his as well as hers. Several times he even went so far as to say
that Miss Macleod was contemplating a visit to London, but that her visit was to be kept a
profound secret, and that he intended introducing her to three of his friends and no more--George
Meredith, W.B. Yeats, and myself. Probably he made the same mock-confidence to other friends,
as a part of his general scheme of mystification. On one occasion, when I was sitting with
him in his study, he pointed to the framed portrait of a beautiful woman which stood on top
of a revolving book-case, and said "That is Fiona!" I affected belief, but, rightly or wrongly,
it was my strong impression that the portrait thus labelled was that of a well-known Irish
lady prominently identified with Home Rule politics, and I smiled to myself at the audacious
white lie. Mrs. Sharp, whose remembrance of her husband goes back to "a merry, mischievous
little boy in his eighth year, with light-brown curly hair, blue-grey eyes, and a laughing
face, and dressed in a tweed kilt," tells us that this "love not only of mystery for its own
sake, but of mystification also," was a marked characteristic of his nature--a characteristic
developed even in childhood by the necessity he always felt of hiding away from his companions
that visionary side of his life which was almost painfully vivid with him, and the sacredness
of which in late years he felt compelled to screen under his pseudonym.

That William Sharp's affirmation of an actual living and breathing "Fiona Macleod" was, however,
virtually true is confided by this significant and illuminating passage in Mrs. Sharp's biography.
Mrs. Sharp is speaking of a sojourn together in Rome during the spring of 1891, in which her
husband had experienced an unusual exaltation and exuberance of vital and creative energy.

    There, at last [she says], he had found the desired incentive
    towards a true expression of himself, in the stimulus and
    sympathetic understanding of the friend to whom he dedicated the
    first of the books published under his pseudonym. This friendship
    began in Rome and lasted throughout the remainder of his life. And
    though this new phase of his work was at no time the result of
    collaboration, as certain of his critics have suggested, he was
    deeply conscious of his indebtedness to this friend, for--as he
    stated to me in a letter of instructions, written before he went to
    America in 1896, concerning his wishes in the event of his death--he
    realized that it was "to her I owe my development as 'Fiona
    Macleod,' though in a sense of course that began long before I
    knew her, and indeed while I was still a child," and that, as he
    believed, "without her there would have been no 'Fiona Macleod.'"
    Because of her beauty, her strong sense of life and of the joy of
    life; because of her keen intuitions and mental alertness, her
    personality stood for him as a symbol of the heroic women of Greek
    and Celtic days, a symbol that, as he expressed it, unlocked new
    doors in his mind and put him "in touch with ancestral memories" of
    his race. So, for a time, he stilled the critical, intellectual mood
    of William Sharp, to give play to the development of this new-found
    expression of subtle emotions, towards which he had been moving with
    all the ardour of his nature.

From this statement of Mrs. Sharp one naturally turns to the dedication of Pharais to which
she refers, finding a dedicatory letter to "E.W.R." dealing for the most part with "Celtic"
matters, but containing these more personal passages:

    Dear friend [the letter begins], while you gratify me by your
    pleasure in this inscription, you modestly deprecate the dedication
    to you of this study of alien life--of that unfamiliar island-life
    so alien in all ways from the life of cities, and, let me add, from
    that of the great mass of the nation to which, in the communal
    sense, we both belong. But in the Domhan-Tòir of friendship there
    are resting-places where all barriers of race, training, and
    circumstances fall away in dust. At one of these places we met, a
    long while ago, and found that we loved the same things, and in the
    same way.

The letter ends with this: "There is another Pàras (Paradise) than that seen of Alastair of
Innisròn--the Tir-Nan-Oigh of friendship. Therein we both have seen beautiful visions and dreamed
dreams. Take, then, out of my heart, this book of vision and dream."

"Fiona Macleod," then, would appear to be the collective name given to a sort of collaborative
Three-in-One mysteriously working together: an inspiring Muse with the initials E.W.R.; that
psychical "other self" of whose existence and struggle for expression William Sharp had been
conscious all his life; and William Sharp, general littérateur, as known to his friends and
reading public. "Fiona Macleod" would seem to have always existed as a sort of spiritual prisoner
within that comely and magnetic earthly tenement of clay known as William Sharp, but whom William
Sharp had been powerless to free in words, till, at the wand-like touch of E.W.R.--the creative
stimulus of a profound imaginative friendship--a new power of expression had been given to
him--a power of expression strangely missing from William Sharp's previous acknowledged writings.

To speak faithfully, it was the comparative mediocrity, and occasional even positive badness,
of the work done over his own name that formed one of the stumbling-blocks to the acceptance
of the theory that William Sharp could be "Fiona Macleod." Of course, his work had been that
of an accomplished widely-read man of letters, his life of Heine being perhaps his most notable
achievement in prose; and his verse had not been without intermittent flashes and felicities,
suggestive of smouldering poetic fires, particularly in his Sospiri di Roma; but, for the most
part, it had lacked any personal force or savour, and was entirely devoid of that magnetism
with which William Sharp, the man, was so generously endowed. In fact, its disappointing inadequacy
was a secret source of distress to the innumerable friends who loved him with a deep attachment,
to which the many letters making one of the delightful features of Mrs. Sharp's biography bear
witness. In himself William Sharp was so prodigiously a personality, so conquering in the romantic
flamboyance of his sun-like vitality, so overflowing with the charm of a finely sensitive,
richly nurtured temperament, so essentially a poet in all he felt and did and said, that it
was impossible patiently to accept his writings as any fair expression of himself. He was,
as we say, so much more than his books--so immeasurably and delightfully more--that, compared
with himself, his books practically amounted to nothing; and one was inclined to say of him
in one's heart, as one does sometimes say of such imperfectly articulate artistic natures:
"What a pity he troubles to write at all! Why not be satisfied with being William Sharp? Why
spoil 'William Sharp' by this inadequate and misleading translation?"

The curious thing, too, was that the work he did over his own name, after "Fiona Macleod" had
escaped into the freedom of her own beautiful individual utterance, showed no improvement in
quality, no marks of having sprung from the same mental womb where it had lain side by side
with so fair a sister. But, of course, one can readily understand that such work would naturally
lack spontaneity of impulse, having to be done, more or less, against the grain, from reasons
of expediency: so long as "Fiona Macleod" must remain a secret, William Sharp must produce
something to show for himself, in order to go on protecting that secret, which would, also,
be all the better kept by William Sharp continuing in his original mediocrity. Of this dual
activity, Mrs. Sharp thus writes with much insight:

    From then till the end of his life [she says] there was a continual
    play of the two forces in him, or of the two sides of his nature: of
    the intellectually observant, reasoning mind--the actor, and of the
    intuitively observant, spiritual mind--the dreamer, which
    differentiated more and more one from the other, and required
    different conditions, different environment, different stimuli,
    until he seemed to be two personalities in one. It was a development
    which, as it proceeded, produced a tremendous strain on his physical
    and mental resources, and at one time between 1897-8 threatened him
    with a complete nervous collapse. And there was for a time distinct
    opposition between those two natures which made it extremely
    difficult for him to adjust his life, for the two conditions were
    equally imperative in their demands upon him.

    His preference, naturally, was for the intimate creative work which
    he knew grew out of his inner self; though the exigencies of life,
    his dependence on his pen for his livelihood, and, moreover, the
    keen active interest "William Sharp" took in all the movements of
    the day, literary and political, at home and abroad, required of
    him a great amount of applied study and work.

The strain must indeed have been enormous, and one cannot but feel that much of it was a needless,
even trivial "expense of spirit," and regret that, when "Fiona Macleod" had so manifestly come
into her own, William Sharp should have continued to keep up the mystification, entailing as
it did such an elaborate machinery of concealment, not the least taxing of which must have
been the necessity of keeping up "Fiona Macleod's" correspondence as well as his own. Better,
so to say, to have thrown William Sharp overboard, and to have reserved the energies of a temperament
almost abnormally active, but physically delusive and precarious, for the finer productiveness
of "Fiona Macleod." But William Sharp deemed otherwise. He was wont to say, "Should the secret
be found out, Fiona dies," and in a letter to Mrs. Thomas A. Janvier--she and her husband being
among the earliest confidants of his secret--he makes this interesting statement: "I can write
out of my heart in a way I could not do as William Sharp, and indeed I could not do so if I
were the woman Fiona Macleod is supposed to be, unless veiled in scrupulous anonymity.... This
rapt sense of oneness with nature, this cosmic ecstasy and elation, this wayfaring along the
extreme verges of the common world, all this is so wrought up with the romance of life that
I could not bring myself to expression by my outer self, insistent and tyrannical as that need
is.... My truest self, the self who is below all other selves, and my most intimate life and
joys and sufferings, thoughts, emotions, and dreams, must find expression, yet I cannot save
in this hidden way...."

Later he wrote: "Sometimes I am tempted to believe I am half a woman, and so far saved as I
am by the hazard of chance from what a woman can be made to suffer if one let the light of
the common day illuminate the avenues and vistas of her heart...."

At one time, I thought that William Sharp's assumption of a feminine pseudonym was a quite
legitimate device to steal a march on his critics, and to win from them, thus disguised, that
recognition which he must have been aware he had failed to win in his own person. Indeed, it
is doubtful whether, if he had published the "Fiona Macleod" writings under his own name, they
would have received fair critical treatment. I am very sure that they would not; for there
is quite a considerable amount of so-called "criticism" which is really foregone conclusion
based on personal prejudice, or biassed preconception, and the refusal to admit (employing
a homely image) that an old dog does occasionally learn new tricks. Many well-known writers
have resorted to this device, sometimes with considerable success. Thither conclude if you must

"The green life" was a phrase often on Sharp's lips, and stood for him for that mysterious
life of elemental things to which he was almost uncannily sensitive, and into which he seemed
able strangely to merge himself, of which too his writings as "Fiona Macleod" prove him to
have had "invisible keys." It is this, so to say, conscious pantheism, this kinship with the
secret forces and subtle moods of nature, this responsiveness to her mystic spiritual "intimations,"
that give to those writings their peculiar significance and value. In the external lore of
nature William Sharp was exceptionally learned. Probably no writer in English, with the exceptions
of George Meredith and Grant Allen, was his equal here, and his knowledge had been gained,
as such knowledge can only be gained, in that receptive period of an adventurous boyhood of
which he has thus written: "From fifteen to eighteen I sailed up every loch, fjord, and inlet
in the Western Highlands and islands, from Arran and Colonsay to Skye and the Northern Hebrides,
from the Rhinns of Galloway to the Ord of Sutherland. Wherever I went I eagerly associated
myself with fishermen, sailors, shepherds, gamekeepers, poachers, gypsies, wandering pipers,
and other musicians." For two months he had "taken the heather" with, and had been "star-brother"
and "sun-brother" to, a tribe of gypsies, and in later years he had wandered variously in many
lands, absorbing the wonder and the beauty of the world. Well might he write to Mrs. Janvier:
"I have had a very varied, and, to use a much abused word, a very romantic life in its internal
as well as in its external aspects."

And to those who loved him it is a great happiness to know that he was able to crown this ecstasy
of living with that victory of expression for which his soul had so long travailed, and to
leave behind him not only a lovely monument of star-lit words, but a spiritual legacy of perennial
refreshment, a fragrant treasure-house of recaptured dreams, and hallowed secrets of the winds
of time: for such are The Writings of "Fiona Macleod".

FORBES-ROBERTSON: AN APPRECIATION

The voluntary abdication of power in its zenith has always fascinated and "intrigued" the imagination
of mankind. We are so accustomed to kings and other gifted persons holding on to their sceptres
with a desperate tenacity, even through those waning years when younger men, beholding their
present feebleness, wonder whether their previous might was not a fancy of their fathers, whether,
in fact, they were ever really kings or gifted persons at all. In so many cases we have to
rely on a legend of past accomplishment to preserve our reverence. Therefore, when a Sulla
or a Charles V. or a Mary Anderson, leave their thrones at the moment when their sway over
us is most assured and brilliant, we wonder--wonder at a phenomenon rare in humanity, and suggestive
of romantic reserves of power which seal not only our allegiance to them, but that of posterity.
The mystery which resides in all greatness, in all charm, is not violated by the cynical explanations
of decay. They remain fortunate as those whom the gods loved, wearing the aureoles of immortal
promise.

Few artists have been wise in this respect; poets, for example, very seldom. Thus we find the
works of most of them encumbered with the débris of their senility. Coventry Patmore was a
rare example of a poet who laid down his pen deliberately, not merely as an artist in words,
but as an artist in life, having, as he said in the memorable preface to the collected edition
of his poems, completed that work which in his youth he had set before him. His readers, therefore,
are not saddened by any pathetic gleanings from a once-rich harvest-field, or the carefully
picked-up shakings of November boughs.

Forbes-Robertson is one of those artists who has chosen to bid farewell to his art while he
is still indisputably its master. One or two other distinguished actors before him have thus
chosen, and a greater number have bade us, those professional "farewells" that remind one of
that dream of De Quincey in which he heard reverberated "Everlasting farewells! and again and
yet again reverberated--everlasting farewells!" In Forbes-Robertson's case, however, apart
from our courteous taking the word of his management, we know that the news is sadly true.
There is a curious personal honour and sincerity breathing through all his impersonations that
make us feel, so to say, that not only would we take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds,
but that between him and his art is such an austere compact that he would be incapable of humiliating
it by any mere advertising devices; and beyond that, those who have seen him play this time
(1914) in New York must have been aware that in the very texture of all his performances was
woven like a sigh the word "farewell." His very art, as I shall have later to emphasize, is
an art of farewell; but, apart from that general quality, it seemed to me, though, indeed,
it may have been mere sympathetic fancy, that in these last New York performances, as in the
performances last spring in London, I heard a personal valedictory note. Forbes-Robertson seemed
to be saying good-by at once to his audience and to his art.

In doing this, along with the inevitable sadness that must accompany such a step, one cannot
but think there will be a certain private whimsical satisfaction for him in being able to go
about the world in after years with his great gift still his, hidden away, but still his to
use at any moment, and to know not only that he has been, but still is, as it were, in secret,
the supreme Hamlet of his time. Something like that, one may imagine, must be the private fun
of abdication. Forbes-Robertson, as he himself has told us, lays down one art only to take
up another to which he has long been devoted, and of his early affiliation to which the figure
of Love Kissing Beatrice in Rossetti's "Dante's Dream" bears illustrious and significant witness.
As, one recalls that he was the model for that figure one realizes that even then he was the
young lord Hamlet, born to be par excellence the actor of sorrow and renunciation.

It is not my province to write here of Forbes-Robertson from the point of view of the reminiscent
playgoer or of the technical critic of acting. Others, obviously, are far better qualified
to undertake those offices for his fame. I would merely offer him the tribute of one to whom
for many years his acting has been something more than acting, as usually understood, something
to class with great poetry, and all the spiritual exaltation which "great poetry" implies.
From first to last, however associated with that whimsical comedy of which, too, he is appropriately
a master, he has struck for me that note of almost heartbreaking spiritual intensity which,
under all its superficial materialism and cynicism, is the key-note of the modern world.

When I say "first," I am thinking of the first time I saw him, on the first night of The Profligate
by Pinero, in its day one of the plays that blazed the trail for that social, or, rather, I
should say, sociological, drama since become even more deadly in earnest, though perhaps less
deadly in skill. Incidentally, I remember that Miss Olga Nethersole, then quite unknown, made
a striking impression of evil, though playing only a small part. It was Forbes-Robertson, however,
for me, and I think for all the playgoing London of the time, that gave the play its chief
value by making us startlingly aware, through the poignancy of his personality, of what one
might call the voice of the modern conscience. To associate that thrillingly beautiful and
profound voice of his with anything that sounds so prosaic as a "modern conscience" may seem
unkind, but actually our modern conscience is anything but prosaic, and combines within it
something at once poetic and prophetic, of which that something ghostly in Forbes-Robertson's
acting is peculiarly expressive. That quality of other-worldliness which at once scared and
fascinated the lodgers in The Passing of the Third Floor Back is present in all Forbes-Robertson's
acting. It was that which strangely stirred us, that first night of The Profligate. We meet
it again with the blind Dick Heldar in The Light That Failed, and of course we meet it supremely
in Hamlet. In fact, it is that quality which, chief among others, makes Forbes-Robertson's
Hamlet the classical Hamlet of his time.

Forbes-Robertson has of course played innumerable parts. Years before The Profligate, he had
won distinction as the colleague of Irving and Mary Anderson. He may be said to have played
everything under the sun. His merely theatric experience has thus enriched and equipped his
temperament with a superb technique. It would probably be impossible for him to play any part
badly, and of the various successes he has made, to which his present repertoire bears insufficient
witness, others, as I have said, can point out the excellences. My concern here is with his
art in its fullest and finest expression, in its essence; and therefore it is unnecessary for
me to dwell upon any other of his impersonations than that of Hamlet. When a man can play Hamlet
so supremely, it may be taken for granted, I presume, that he can play Mice and Men, or even
that masterpiece of all masterpieces, Caesar and Cleopatra. I trust that it is no disrespect
to the distinguished authors of these two plays to say that such plays in a great actor's repertoire
represent less his versatility than his responsibilities, that pot-boiling necessity which
hampers every art, and that of the actor, perhaps, most of all.

To my thinking, the chief interest of all Forbes-Robertson's other parts is that they have
"fed" his Hamlet; and, indeed, many of his best parts may be said to be studies for various
sides of Hamlet, his fine Romeo, for example, which, unfortunately, he no longer plays. In
Hamlet all his qualities converge, and in him the tradition of the stage that all an ambitious
actor's experience is only to fit him to play Hamlet is for once justified. But, of course,
the chief reason of that success is that nature meant Forbes-Robertson to play Hamlet. Temperament,
personality, experience, and training have so worked together that he does not merely play,
but is, Hamlet. Such, at all events, is the complete illusion he is able to produce.

Of course, one has heard from them of old time that an actor's personality must have nothing
to do with the part he is playing; that he only is an actor who can most successfully play
the exact opposite of himself. That is the academic theory of "character-acting," and of course
the half-truth of it is obvious. It represents the weariness induced in audiences by handsome
persons who merely, in the stage phrase, "bring their bodies on"; yet it would go hard with
some of our most delightful comedians were it the whole truth about acting. As a matter of
fact, of course, a great actor includes a multiplicity of selves, so that he may play many
parts, yet always be playing himself. Beyond himself no artist, whatever his art, has ever gone.

What reduplication of personality is necessary for the man who plays Hamlet need hardly be
said, what wide range of humanity and variety of accomplishment; for, as Anatole France has
finely said of Hamlet, "He is a man, he is man, he is the whole of man."

Time was when Hamlet was little more than an opportunity for some robustious periwig-pated
fellow, or it gave the semi-learned actor the chance to conceal his imaginative incapacity
by a display of "new readings." For example, instead of saying:

          The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold,

you diverted attention from your acting by an appeal to the literary antiquarianism of your
audience, and, out of one or other of the quartos, read the line:

          The air bites shrewdly; is it very cold?

with the implication that there was a whole world of suggestion in the difference.

One has known actors, far from unillustrious, who staked their whole performance on some such
learned triviality or some trifling novelty of business, when, for example, in Hamlet's scene
with his mother, the prince comes to:

          Look here upon this picture, and on this.

An actor who deserves better than he has yet received in the tradition of the acted Hamlet--I
mean Wilson Barrett--used to make much of taking a miniature of his father from his bosom to
point the contrast.

But all such things in the end are of no account. New readings, new business, avail less and
less. Nor does painstaking archaeology of scenery or dresses any longer throw dust in our eyes.
We are for the play, the living soul of the play. Give us that, and your properties may be
no more elaborate than those of a guignol in the Champs-Elysées.

Forbes-Robertson's acting is so imaginative, creating the scene about him as he plays, that
one almost resents any stage-settings for him at all, however learnedly accurate and beautifully
painted.

His soul seems to do so much for us that we almost wish it could be left to do it all, and
he act for us as they acted in Elizabeth's day, with only a curtain for scenery, and a placard
at the side of the stage saying, "This is Elsinore."

One could hardly say more for one's sense of the reality of Forbes-Robertson's acting, as,
naturally, one is not unaware that distressing experiments have been made to reproduce the
Elizabethan theatre by actors who, on the other hand, were sadly in need of all that scenery,
archaeology, or orchestra could do for them.

With a world overcrowded with treatises on the theme, from, and before, Gervinus, with the
commentary of Wilhelm Meister in our minds, not to speak of the starlit text ever there for
our reading, there is surely no need to traverse the character of Hamlet. He has meant so much
to our fathers--though he can never have meant so much to them as he does to us of today--that
he is, so to say, in our blood. He is strangely near to our hearts by sheer inheritance. And
perhaps the most beautiful thing Forbes-Robertson's Hamlet does for us is that it commands
our love for a great gentleman doing his gentlest and bravest and noblest with a sad smile
and a gay humour, in not merely a complicated, wicked, absurd, and tiresome, but, also, a ghostly
world.

When we think of Hamlet, we think of him as two who knew him very well thought of him,--Ophelia
and Horatio,--and as one who saw him only as he sat at last on his throne, dead, with the crown
of Denmark on his knees.

We think of him, too, as the haunted son of a dear father murdered, a philosophic spectator
of the grotesque brutality of life, suddenly by a ghostly summons called on to take part in
it; a prince, a philosopher, a lover, a soldier, a sad humourist.

Were one asked what aspects of Hamlet does Forbes-Robertson specially embody, I should say,
in the first place, his princeliness, his ghostliness, then his cynical and occasionally madcap
humour, as where, at the end of the play-scene, he capers behind the throne in a terrible boyish
glee. No actor that I have seen expresses so well that scholarly irony of the Renaissance permeating
the whole play. His scene with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and the recorders is masterly:
the silken sternness of it, the fine hauteur, the half-appeal as of lost ideals still pleading
with the vulgarity of life, the fierce humour of its disillusion, and behind, as always, the
heartbreak--that side of which comes of the recognition of what it is to be a gentleman in
such a world.

In this scene, too, as in others, Forbes-Robertson makes it clear that that final tribute of
Fortinbras was fairly won.

The soldier--if necessary, the fighter--is there as supple and strong as a Damascus blade.
One is always aware of the "something dangerous," for all his princely manners and scholarly
ways. One is never left in doubt as to how this Hamlet will play the man. It is all too easy
for him to draw his sword and make an end of the whole fantastic business. Because this philosophic
swordsman holds the sword, let no one think that he knows not how to wield it. All this gentleness--have
a care!--is that of an unusually masculine restraint.

In the scene with Ophelia, Forbes-Robertson's tenderness was almost terrible. It came from
such a height of pity upon that little uncomprehending flower!

"I never gave you aught," as Forbes-Robertson said it, seemed to mean: "I gave you all--all
that you could not understand." "Yet are not you and I in the toils of that destiny there that
moves the arras. Is it your father?"

Along with Forbes-Robertson's spiritual interpretation of Shakespeare goes pre-eminently, and
doubtless as a contributive part of it, his imaginative revitalization of the great old lines--lines
worn like a highway with the passage of the generations. As a friend of mine graphically phrased
it, "How he revives for us the splendour of the text!"

The splendour of the text! It is a good phrase, and how splendid the text is we, of course,
all know--know so well that we take it for granted, and so fall into forgetfulness of its significance;
forgetting what central fires of soul and intellect must have gone to the creation of such
a world of transcendent words.

Yet how living the lines still are, though the generations have almost quoted the life out
of them, no man who has spoken them on the stage in our day, except Forbes-Robertson, has had
the gift to show.

It is more than elocution, masterly elocution as it is, more than the superbly modulated voice:
the power comes of spiritual springs welling up beneath the voice--springs fed from those infinite
sources which "lie beyond the reaches of our souls."

Merely to take the phrase I have just quoted, how few actors--or readers of Shakespeare, or
members of any Shakespearian audience, for that matter--have any personal conception of what
it means! They may make a fine crescendo with it, but that is all. They have never stood, shrinking
and appalled, yet drawn with a divine temptation, upon the brink of that vastness along the
margin of which, it is evident, that Hamlet often wandered. It is in vain they tell their audiences
and Horatio:

          There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
          Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

We are quite sure that they know nothing of what they are saying; and that, as a matter of
fact, there are few things for them in heaven or earth except the theatre they are playing
in, their actors' club, and, generally, their genial mundane lives; and, of course, one rather
congratulates them on the simplicity of their lives, congratulates them on their ignorance
of such haunted regions of the mind. Yet, all the same, that simplicity seems to disqualify
them from playing Hamlet.

Few Shakespearian actors seem to remember what they are playing--Shakespeare. One would think
that to be held a worthy interpreter of so great a dramatist, so mysterious a mind, and so
golden a poet, were enough distinction. Oscar Wilde, in a fine sonnet, addressed Henry Irving as

          Thou trumpet set for Shakespeare's lips to blow,

and we may be sure that Irving appreciated the honour thus paid him, he who so wonderfully
interpreted so many of Shakespeare's moods, so well understood the irony of his intellect,
even the breadth of his humanity, yet in Hamlet, at all events, so strangely missed his soul.

Most of us have seen many Hamlets die. We have watched them squirming through those scientific
contortions of dissolution, to copy which they had very evidently walked the hospitals in a
businesslike quest of death-agonies, as certain histrionic connoisseurs of madness in France
lovingly haunt the Saltpétrière. As I look back, I wonder how we tolerated their wriggling
absurdity. I suppose it was that the hand of tradition was still upon us, as upon them. All
my life I seem to have been asking my friends, those I loved best, those who valued the dearest,
the kindest, the greatest, and the strongest in our strange human life, to come with me and
see Forbes-Robertson die in Hamlet. I asked them because, as that strange young dead king sat
upon his throne, there was something, whatever it meant--death, life, immortality, what you
will--of a surpassing loveliness, something transfiguring the poor passing moment of trivial,
brutal murder into a beauty to which it was quite natural that that stern Northern warrior,
with his winged helmet, should bend the knee. I would not exchange anything I have ever read
or seen for Forbes-Robertson as he sits there so still and starlit upon the throne of Denmark.

Forbes-Robertson is not merely a great Shakespearian actor; he is a great spiritual actor.
The one doubtless implies the other, though the implication has not always appeared to be obvious.

He is prophetic of what the stage will some day be, and what we can see it here and there preparing
to become. In all the welter of the dramatic conditions of the moment there emerges one fact,
that of the growing importance of the stage as a vehicle for what one may term general culture.
The stage, with its half-sister, the cinema, is strangely, by how long and circuitous a route,
returning of course, with an immeasurably developed equipment, to its starting-point, ending
curiously where it began as the handmaid of the church. As with the old moralities or miracle-plays,
it is becoming once more our teacher. The lessons of truth and beauty, as those of plain gaiety
and delight, are relying more and more upon the actor for their expression, and less on the
accredited doctors of divinity or literature. Even the dancers are doing much for our souls.
Our duties as citizens are being taught us by well-advertised plays, and if we wish to abolish
Tammany or change our police commissioner, we enforce our desire by the object-lesson of a
play. The great new plays may not yet be here, but the public once more is going to the theatre,
as it went long ago in Athens, to be delighted and amused, of course, but also to be instructed
in national and civic affairs, and, most important of all, to be purified by pity and terror.

A MEMORY OF FRÉDÉRIC MISTRAL

There are many signs that poetry is coming into its own again--even here in America, which,
while actually one of the most romantic and sentimental of countries, fondly imagines itself
the most prosaic.

Kipling, to name but one instance, has, by his clarion-tongued quickening of the British Empire,
shown so convincingly what dynamic force still belongs to the right kind of singing, and the
poet in general seems to be winning back some of that serious respect from his fellow-citizens
which, under a misapprehension of his effeminacy and general uselessness, he had lost awhile.
The poet is not so much a joke to the multitude as he was a few years ago, and the term "minor
poet" seems to have fallen into desuetude.

Still for all this, I doubt if it is in the Anglo-Saxon blood, nowadays at all events, to make
a national hero of a poet, one might say a veritable king, such as Frédéric Mistral is today
in Provence. In our time, Björnson in Norway was perhaps the only parallel figure, and he held
his position as actual "father of his people" for very much the same reasons. At once a commanding
and lovable personality, he and his work were absolutely identified with his country and his
countrymen. He was simply Norway incarnate.

So, today in Provence, it is with Frédéric Mistral. He is not only a poet of Provence. He is
Provence incarnate, and, apart from the noble quality of his work, his position as the foremost
representative of his compatriots is romantically unique. No other country today, pointing
to its greatest man, would point out--a poet; whereas Mistral, were he not as unspoiled as
he is laurelled, might, with literal truth, say:

          "Provence--c'est moi!"

We had hardly set foot in Provence this last spring, my wife and I, before we realized, with
grateful wonder, that we had come to a country that has a poet for a king.

On arriving at Marseilles almost the first word we heard was "Mistral"--not the bitter wind
of the same name, but the name of the honey-tongued "Master." Our innkeeper--O the delightful
innkeepers of France!--on our consulting him as to our project of a walking trip through the
Midi--as Frenchmen usually speak of Provence--said, for his first aid to the traveller: "Then,
of course, you will see our great poet, Mistral." And he promptly produced a copy of Mirèio,
which he begged me to use till I had bought a copy for myself.

"Ah! Mistral," he cried, with Gallic enthusiasm, using the words I have borrowed from his lips,
"Mistral is the King of Provence!"

Marseilles had not always been so enthusiastic over Mistral and his fellows. And Mistral, in
his memoirs, gives an amusing account of a philological battle fought over the letter "s" in
a room behind one of the Marseilles bookshops between "the amateurs of trivialities, the rhymers
of the white beard, the jealous, the grumblers," and the young innovators of the "félibrige."

But that was over fifty years ago, and the battle of those young enthusiasts has long since
been won. What that battle was and what an extraordinary victory came of it must needs be told
for the significance of Mistral in Provence to be properly understood.

The story is one of the most romantic in the history of literature. Briefly, it is this:

The Provençal language, the "langue d'oc," was, of course, once the courtly and lettered language
of Europe, the language of the great troubadours, and through them the vehicle of the culture
and refinement of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. From it may be said to have sprung
the beginnings of Italian literature.

But, owing to various historical vicissitudes, the language of Northern France, the "langue
d'oil," gradually took its place, and when Mistral was born, in 1830, Provençal had long been
regarded as little more than a patois.

Now it was the young Mistral's dream, as a school-boy in the old convent school of Saint Michael
de Frigolet, at Avignon, to restore his native tongue to its former high estate, to make it
once more a literary language, and it chanced that one of his masters, Joseph Roumanille, was
secretly cherishing the same dream.

The master, looking over his pupil's shoulder one day, found that, instead of working at his
prescribed task, he was busily engaged in translating the Penitential Psalms into Provençal.
Instead of punishing him, the master gratefully hailed a kindred spirit, and presently confided
Provençal verses of his own making. From that moment, though there was a dozen years' difference
between their ages, Mistral and Roumanille began a friendship which was to last till Roumanille's
death, a friendship of half a century.

Soon their dream attracted other recruits, and presently seven friends, whose names are all
famous now, and most of whom have statues in Arles or in Avignon--Roumanille, Mistral, Aubanel,
Mathieu, Giéra, Brunet, and Tavan--after the manner of Ronsard's "Pléiade," and Rossetti's
"P.R.B."--formed themselves into a brotherhood to carry on the great work of regeneration.

They needed a name to call themselves by. They had all met together to talk things over in
the old castle of Font-Ségugne, or, as Mistral more picturesquely puts it: "It was written
in heaven that one blossoming Sunday, the twenty-first of May, 1854, in the full springtide
of life and of the year, seven poets should come to meet together in the castle of Font-Ségugne."
Several suggestions were made for a name for this brotherhood, but presently Mistral announced
that in an old folk-story he had collected at his birthplace, Maillane, he believed that he
had found the word they were in search of. In this folk-story the boy Christ is represented
as discoursing in the temple with "the seven félibres of the Law."

"Why, that is us!" exclaimed the enthusiastic young men as Mistral finished, and there on the
spot "félibre" was adopted as the password of their order, Mistral coining the word "félibrige"
to represent the work they aimed to do, and also their association. The name stuck, and has
now for many years been the banner-word for the vigorous school of Provençal literature and
the allied arts of painting and sculpture which has responded with such eager vitality to Mistral's
rallying cry.

But, excellent as are the other poets which the school has produced--and one need only glance
through a recent Anthologie du Félibrige to realize what a wealth of true poetry the word "félibrige"
now stands for--there can be no question that its greatest asset still remains Mistral's own
work, as it was his first great poem, Mirèio, which first drew the eyes of literary Paris,
more than inclined to be contemptuous, to the Provençal renaissance.

Adolphe Dumas had been sent to Provence in the year 1856 by the Minister of Public Instruction
to collect the folk-songs of the people, and calling on Mistral (then twenty-six), living quietly
with his widowed mother at Maillane, he had found him at work on Mirèio. Mistral read some
passages to him, with the result that the generous Dumas returned to Paris excitedly to proclaim
the advent of a new poet. Presently, Mistral accepted his invitation to visit Paris, was introduced
to the great Lamartine--who has left some charming pages descriptive of his visit,--read some
of Mirèio to him, and was hailed by him as "the Homer of Provence."

The press, however, had its little fling at the new-comer. "The Mistral it appears," said one
pitiful punster, "has been incarnated in a poem. We shall soon see whether it is anything else
but wind." Such has been the invariable welcome of great men in a small world.

But Mistral had no taste for Paris, either as a lion or a butt, and, after a few days' stay,
we find him once more quietly at home at Maillane. Yet he had brought back with him one precious
trophy--the praise of Lamartine; and when, in the course of a year or two (1859), Mirèio came
to be published at Avignon, it bore, as it still bears, this heart-felt dedication to Lamartine:

"To thee I dedicate Mirèio; it is my heart and my soul; it is the flower of my years; it is
a bunch of grapes from Crau with all its leaves--a rustic's offering."

With the publication of Mirèio Mistral instantly "arrived," instantly found himself on that
throne which, as year has followed year, has become more securely his own. Since then he has
written much noble poetry, all embodying and vitalizing the legendary lore of his native land,
a land richer in momentous history, perhaps, than any other section of Europe. But in addition
to his poetry he has, single-handed, carried through the tremendous scholarly task of compiling
a dictionary of the Provençal language--a Thesaurus of the Félibrige, for which work the Institute
awarded him a prize of ten thousand francs.

In 1904, he was awarded the Nobel prize of 100,000 francs, but such is his devotion to his
fellow-countrymen that he did not keep that prize for himself, but used it to found the Musée
Arlésien at Arles, a museum designed as a treasure house of anything and everything pertaining
to the history and life of Provence--antiquities, furniture, costumes, paintings, and so forth.

It was in Arles in 1909, the fiftieth birthday of Mirèio, that Mistral, then seventy-nine years
old, may be said to have reached the summit of his romantic fame. A great festival was held
in his honour, in which the most distinguished men of France took part. A dramatized version
of his Mirèio was played in the old Roman amphitheatre, and a striking statue of him was unveiled
in the antique public square, the Place du Forum, with the shade of Constantine looking on,
one might feel, from his mouldering palace hard by.

In Arles Mistral is a well-known, beloved figure, for it is his custom, every Saturday, to
come there from Maillane, to cast his eye over the progress of his museum, the pet scheme of
his old age. One wonders how it must seem to pass that figure of himself, pedestaled high in
the old square. To few men is it given to pass by their own statues in the street. Sang a very
different poet--

          They grind us to the dust with poverty,
          And build us statues when we come to die.

But poor Villon had the misfortune to be a poet of the "langue d'oil," and the Montfaucon gibbet
was the only monument of which he stood in daily expectation. Could the lines of two poets
offer a greater contrast? Blessed indeed is he who serves the rural gods, Pan and Old Sylvanus
and the sister nymphs--as Virgil sang; and Virgilian indeed has been the golden calm, and sunlit
fortunes, as Virgilian, rather than Homeric, is the gracious art, of the poet whom his first
Parisian admirer, Adolphe Dumas, called "the Homer of Provence"--as Virgilian, too, seemed
the landscape through which at length, one April afternoon, we found ourselves on pilgrimage
to the home of him whose name had been on the lips of every innkeeper, shopkeeper, and peasant,
all the way from Marseilles to Tarascon.

Yes! the same golden peace that lies like a charm across every page of his greatest poem lay
across that sun-steeped, fertile plain, with its walls of cypress trees, its lines of poplars,
its delicate, tapestry-like designs of almond trees in blossom, on a sombre background of formal
olive orchards, its green meadows, lit up with singing water-courses, or gleaming irrigation
canals, starred here and there with the awakening kingcup, or sweet with the returning violet--here
and there a farmhouse ("mas," as they call them in Provence) snugly sheltered from the mistral
by their screens of foliage--and far aloft in the distance, floating like a silver dream, the
snow-white shoulder of Mont Ventoux--the Fuji Yama of Provence.

At last the old, time-worn village came in sight--it lies about ten miles north-east of Tartarin's
Tarascon--and we entered it, as was proper, with the "Master's" words on our lips: "Maillane
is beautiful, well-pleasing is Maillane; and it grows more and more beautiful every day. Maillane
is the honour of the countryside, and takes its name from the month of May.

"Who would be in Paris or in Rome? Poor conscripts! There is nothing to charm one there; but
Maillane has its equal nowhere--and one would rather eat an apple in Maillane than a partridge
in Paris."

It was Sunday afternoon, and the streets were full of young people in their Sunday finery,
the girls wearing the pretty Arlésien caps. At first sight of us, with our knapsacks, they
were prepared to be amused, and saucy lads called out things in mock English; but when it was
understood that we were seeking the house of the "Master" we inspired immediate respect, and
a dozen eager volunteers put themselves at our service and accompanied us in a body to where,
at the eastern edge of the village, there stands an unpretentious square stone house of no
great antiquity, surrounded by a garden and half hidden with trees.

We stood silently looking at the house for a few minutes, trying to realize that there a great
poet had gone on living and working, in single-minded devotion to his art and his people, for
full fifty years--there in that green, out-of-the-way corner of the world. The idea of a life
so rooted in contentment, so continuously happy in the lifelong prosecution of a task set to
itself in boyhood, and so independent of change, is one not readily grasped by the hurrying
American mind.

Then we pushed open the iron gate and passed into the garden. A paved walk led up to the front
door, but that had an unused look, and, gaining no response there, we walked through a shrubbery
around the side of the house, and as we turned the corner came on what was evidently the real
entrance, facing a sunny slope of garden where hyacinths and violets told of the coming of
spring. Here we were greeted by some half a dozen friendly dogs, whose demonstrations brought
to the door a neat little, keen-eyed peasant woman, with an expression in her face that suggested
that she was the real watch dog, on behalf of her master, standing between him and an intrusive
world. As a matter of fact, as we afterward learned, that is one of her many self-imposed offices,
for, having been in the Mistral household for many years, she has long since been as much a
family friend as a servant, and generally looks after the Master and Mme. Mistral as if they
were her children, nursing and "bossing" them by turns. "Elise"--I think her name is--is a
"character" almost as well known in Provence as the Master himself.

So she looked sharply at us, while I produced a letter to M. Mistral which had been given me
by a humble associate of the "félibres," a delightful chansonnier we had met at Les Baux. With
this she went indoors, presently to return with a face of still cautious welcome, and invited
us in to a little square hall hung with photographs of various distinguished friends of the
poet and two bronze medallions of himself, one representing him with his favourite dog.

Then a door to the right opened, revealing a typical scholar's study, lined with books from
ceiling to floor, books and papers on tables and chairs, and framed photographs again on the
free wall space. The spring sunshine poured in through long windows, and in this characteristic
setting stood a tall old man, astonishingly erect, his distinguished head, with its sparse
white locks, its keen eyes, and strong yet delicate aquiline features, pointed white beard
and mustache, suggesting pictures of some military grand seigneur of old time. His carriage
had the same blending of soldier and nobleman, and the stately kindliness with which he bade
us welcome belonged, alas! to another day.

At his side stood a tall, handsome lady, with remarkable, dark, kind eyes, evidently many years
his junior. This was Mme. Mistral, in her day one of those "queens of beauty" whom the "félibres"
elect every seven years at their floral fêtes. Mme. Mistral was no less gracious to us than
her husband, and joined in the talk that followed with much animation and charm.

We had a little feared that M. Mistral, as he declines to write in anything but Provençal,
might carry his artistic creed into his conversation too. To our relief, however, he spoke
in the most polished French--for you may know French very well, but be quite unable to understand
Provençal, either printed or spoken. This had sometimes made our journeying difficult, as we
inquired our way of peasants along the road.

It was natural to talk first to Mistral of literature. We inquired whether he read much English.
He shook his head, smiling. No! outside of one or two of the great classics, Shakespeare and
Milton, for example, he had read little. Yes! he had read one American author--Fenimore Cooper.
Le Feu-Follet had been a favourite book of his boyhood. This we identified as The Fire-Fly.

He seemed to wish to talk about America rather than literature, and seemed immensely interested
in the fact that we were Americans, and he raised his eyes, with an expression of French wonderment,
at the fact of our walking our way through the country--as also at the length of the journey
from America. Evidently it seemed to him a tremendous undertaking.

"You Americans," he said, "are a wonderful people. You think nothing of going around the world."

We were surprised to find that he took the keenest interest in American politics.

"It must be a terribly difficult country to govern," he said. And then he asked us eagerly
for news of our "extraordinary President." We suggested Mr. Wilson.

"Oh, no! no!" he explained. "The extraordinary man who was President before him."

"Colonel Roosevelt?"

Yes, that was the man--a most remarkable man that! So Colonel Roosevelt may be interested to
hear that the poet-king of Provence is an enthusiastic Bull Mooser.

Of course, we talked too of the "félibrige," and it was beautiful to see how M. Mistral's face
softened at the mention of his friend Joseph Roumanille, and with what generosity he attributed
the origin of the great movement to his dead friend.

"But you must by all means call on Mme. Roumanille," said he, "when you go to Avignon, and
say that I sent you"--for Roumanille's widow still lives, one of the most honoured muses of
the "félibrige."

When it was time for us to go on our way, nothing would satisfy M. and Mme. Mistral but that
we drink a glass of a cordial which is made by "Elise" from Mistral's own recipe; and as we
raised the tiny glasses of the innocent liqueur in our hands, Mistral drank "A l'Amérique!"

Then, taking a great slouch hat from a rack in the hall, and looking as though it was his statue
from Aries accompanying us, the stately old man led us out into the road, and pointed us the
way to Avignon.

On the 30th of this coming September that great old man--the memory of whose noble presence
and beautiful courtesy will remain with us forever--will be eighty-three.

February, 1913.

IMPERISHABLE FICTION

The longevity of trees is said to be in proportion to the slowness of their growth. It has
to do no little as well with the depth and area of their roots and the richness of the soil
in which they find themselves. When the sower went forth to sow, it will be remembered, that
which soon sprang up as soon withered away. It was the seed that was content to "bring forth
fruit with patience" that finally won out and survived the others.

These humble, old-fashioned illustrations occur to me as I apply myself to the consideration
of the question provoked by the lightning over-production of modern fiction and modern literature
generally: the question of the flourishing longevity of the fiction of the past as compared
with the swift oblivion which seems almost invariably to over-take the much-advertised "masterpieces"
of the present.

I read somewhere a ballade asking--where are the "best sellers" of yesteryear? The ballad-maker
might well ask, and one might re-echo with Villon: "Mother of God, ah! where are they?" During
the last twenty years they have been as the sands on the seashore for multitude, yet I think
one would be hard set to name a dozen of them whose titles even are still on the lips of men--whereas
several quieter books published during that same period, unheralded by trumpet or fire-balloon,
are seen serenely to be ascending to a sure place in the literary firmament.

What can be the reason? Can the decay of these forgotten phenomena of modern fiction, so lavishly
crowned with laurels manufactured in the offices of their own publishers, have anything to
do with the hectic rapidity of their growth, and may there be some truth in the supposition
that the novels, and books generally, that live longest are those that took the longest to
write, or, at all events underwent the longest periods of gestation?

Some fifteen years or so ago one of the most successful manufacturers of best sellers was Guy
Boothby, whose Dr. Nikola is perhaps still remembered. Unhappily he did not live long to enjoy
the fruits of his industrious dexterity. I bring his case to mind as typical of the modern
machine-made methods.

I had read in a newspaper that he did his "writing" by phonograph, and chancing to meet him
somewhere, asked him about it. His response was to invite me to come down to his charming country
house on the Thames and see how he did it. Boothby was a fine, manly fellow, utterly without
"side" or any illusions as to the quality of his work. He loved good literature too well--Walter
Pater, incongruously enough, was one of his idols--to dream that he could make it. Nor was
the making of literature by any means his first preoccupation, as he made clear, with winning
frankness, within a few moments of my arriving at his home.

Taking me out into his grounds, he brought me to some extensive kennels, where he showed me
with pride some fifty or so prize dogs; then he took me to his stables, his face shining with
pleasure in his thoroughbreds; and again he led the way to a vast hennery, populated with innumerable
prize fowls.

"These are the things I care about," he said, "and I write the stuff for which it appears I
have a certain knack only because it enables me to buy them!"

Would that all writers of best sellers were as engagingly honest. No few of them, however,
write no better and affect the airs of genius into the bargain.

Then Boothby took me into his "study," the entire literary apparatus of which consisted of
three phonographs; and he explained that, when he had dictated a certain amount of a novel
into one of them, he handed it over to his secretary in another room, who set it going and
transcribed what he had spoken into the machine; he, meanwhile, proceeding to fill up another
record. And he concluded airily by saying with a laugh that he had a novel of 60,000 words
to deliver in ten days, and was just on the point of beginning it!

Boothby's method was, I believe, somewhat unusual in those days. Since then it has become something
like the rule. Not so much as regards the phonograph, perhaps, but with respect to the breathless
speed of production.

I am informed by an editor, associated with magazines that use no less than a million and a
half words of fiction a month, that he has among his contributors more than one writer on whom
he can rely to turn off a novel of 60,000 words in six days, and that he can put his finger
on twenty novelists who think nothing of writing a novel of a hundred thousand words in anywhere
from sixty to ninety days. He recalled to me, too, the case of a well-known novelist who has
recently contracted to supply a publisher with four novels in one year, each novel to run to
not less than a hundred thousand words. One thinks of the Scotsman with his "Where's your Willie
Shakespeare now?"

Even Balzac's titanic industry must hide its diminished head before such appalling fecundity;
and what would Horace have to say to such frog-like verbal spawning, with his famous "labour
of the file" and his counsel to writers "to take a subject equal to your powers, and consider
long what your shoulders refuse, what they are able to bear." It is to be feared that "the
monument more enduring than brass" is not erected with such rapidity. The only brass associated
with the modern best seller is to be found in the advertisements; and, indeed, all that both
purveyor and consumer seem to care about may well be summed up in the publisher's recommendation
quoted by Professor Phelps: "This book goes with a rush and ends with a smash." Such, one might
add, is the beginning and ending of all literary rockets.

Now let us recall some fiction that has been in the world anywhere from, say, three hundred
years to fifty years and is yet vigorously alive, and, in many instances, to be classed still
with the best sellers.

Don Quixote, for example, was published in 1605, but is still actively selling. Why? May it
perhaps be that it was some six years in the writing, and that a great man, who was soldier
as well as writer, charged it with the vitality of all his blood and tears and laughter, all
the hard-won humanity of years of manful living, those five years as a slave in Algiers (actually
beginning it in prison once more at La Mancha), and all the stern struggle of a storm-tossed
life faced with heroic steadfastness and gaiety of heart?

Take another book which, if it is not read as much as it used to be, and still deserves to
be, is certainly far from being forgotten--Gil Blas. Published in 1715--that is, its first
two parts--it has now two centuries of popularity to its credit, and is still as racy with
humanity as ever; but, though Le Sage was a rapid and voluminous writer, over this one book
which alone the world remembers it is significant to note that he expended unusual time and
pains. He was forty-seven years old when the first two parts were published. The third part
was not published till 1724, and eleven years more were to elapse before the issue of the fourth
and final part in 1735.

A still older book that is still one of the world's best sellers, The Pilgrim's Progress, can
hardly be conceived as being dashed off in sixty or ninety days, and would hardly have endured
so long had not Bunyan put into it those twelve years of soul torment in Bedford gaol. Robinson
Crusoe still sells its annual thousands, whereas others of its author's books no less skilfully
written are practically forgotten, doubtless because Defoe, fifty-eight years old at its publication,
had concentrated in it the ripe experience of a lifetime. Though a boy's book to us, he clearly
intended it for an allegory of his own arduous, solitary life.

"I, Robinson Crusoe," we read, "do affirm that the story, though allegorical, is also historical,
and that it is the beautiful representation of a life of unexampled misfortune, and of a variety
not to be met with in this world."

The Vicar of Wakefield, as we know, was no hurried piece of work. Indeed, Goldsmith went about
it in so leisurely a fashion as to leave it neglected in a drawer of his desk, till Johnson
rescued it, according to the proverbial anecdote; and even then its publisher, Newbery, was
in no hurry, for he kept it by him another two years before giving it to the printer and to
immortality. It was certainly one of those fruits "brought forth with patience" all round.

Tom Jones is another such slow-growing masterpiece. Written in the sad years immediately following
the death of his dearly loved wife, Fielding, dedicating it to Lord Lyttelton, says: "I here
present you with the labours of some years of my life"; and it need scarcely be added that
the book, as in the case of all real masterpieces, represented not merely the time expended
on it, but all the accumulated experience of Fielding's very human history.

Yes! Whistler's famous answer to Ruskin's counsel holds good of all imperishable literature.
Had he the assurance to ask two hundred guineas for a picture that only took a day to paint?
No, replied Whistler, he asked it for "the training of a lifetime"; and it is this training
of a lifetime, in addition to the actual time expended on composition, that constitutes the
reserve force of all great works of fiction, and is entirely lacking in most modern novels,
however superficially brilliant be their workmanship.

For this reason books like George Borrow's Lavengro and Romany Rye, failures on their publication,
grow greater rather than less with the passage of time. Their writers, out of the sheer sincerity
of their natures, furnished them, as by magic, with an inexhaustible provision of life-giving
"ichor."

Of this immortality principle in literature Milton himself, it need hardly be said, is one
of the great exemplars. He was but thirty-two when he first projected Paradise Lost, and through
all the intervening years of hazardous political industry he had kept the seed warm in his
heart, its fruit only to be brought forth with tragic patience in those seven years of blindness
and imminent peril of the scaffold which followed his fiftieth birthday.

The case of poets is not irrelevant to our theme, for the conditions of all great literature,
whatever its nature, are the same. Therefore, we may recall Dante, whose Divine Comedy was
with him from his thirty-fifth year till the year of his death, the bitter-sweet companion
of twenty years of exile. Goethe, again, finished at eighty the Faust he had conceived at twenty.

Spenser was at work on his Faerie Queene, alongside his preoccupation with state business,
for nearly twenty years. Pope was twelve years translating Homer, and I think there is little
doubt that Gray's Elegy owes much of its staying power to the Horatian deliberation with which
Gray polished and repolished it through eight years.

If we are to believe Poe's Philosophy of Composition, and there is, I think, more truth in
it than is generally allowed, the vitality of The Raven, as that, too, of his genuinely imperishable
fictions, is less due to inspiration than to the mathematical painstaking of their composition.

But, perhaps, of all poets, the story of Virgil is most instructive for an age of "get-rich-quick"
littérateurs. On his Georgics alone he worked seven years, and, after working eleven years
on the Aeneid, he was still so dissatisfied with it that on his death-bed he besought his friends
to burn it, and on their refusal, commanded his servants to bring the manuscript that he might
burn it himself. But, fortunately, Augustus had heard portions of it, and the imperial veto
overpowered the poet's infanticidal desire.

But, to return to the novelists, it may at first sight seem that the great writer who, with
the Waverley Novels, inaugurated the modern era of cyclonic booms and mammoth sales, was an
exception to the classic formula of creation which we are endeavouring to make good. Stevenson,
we have been told, used to despair as he thought of Scott's "immense fecundity of invention"
and "careless, masterly ease."

"I cannot compete with that," he says--"what makes me sick is to think of Scott turning out
Guy Mannering in three weeks."

Scott's speed is, indeed, one of the marvels of literary history, yet in his case, perhaps
more than in that of any other novelist, it must be remembered that this speed had, in an unusual
degree, that "training of a lifetime" to rely upon; as from his earliest boyhood all Scott's
faculties had been consciously as well as unconsciously engaged in absorbing and, by the aid
of his astonishing memory, preserving the vast materials on which he was able thus carelessly
to draw.

Moreover, those who have read his manly autobiography know that this speed was by no means
all "ease," as witness the almost tragic composition of The Bride of Lammermoor. If ever a
writer scorned delights and lived laborious days, it was Walter Scott. At the same time the
condition of his fame in the present day bears out the general truth of my contention, for
there is little doubt that he would be more widely read than he is were it not for those too
frequent longueurs and inert paddings which resulted from his too hurried workmanship.

Jane Austen is another example of comparatively rapid creation, writing three of her best-known
novels, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey between the ages of
twenty-one and twenty-three. Yet Pride and Prejudice, which practically survives the others,
took her ten months to complete, and all her writings, it has again to be said, had first been
deeply and intimately "lived."

Charlotte Brontë was a year in writing Jane Eyre, spurred on to new effort by the recent rejection
of The Professor; but to write such a book in a year cannot be called over-hasty production
when one considers how much of Jane Eyre was drawn from Charlotte Brontë's own life, and also
how she and her sisters had been experimenting with literature from their earliest childhood.

Thackeray considered an allowance of two years sufficient for the writing of a good novel,
but that seems little enough when one takes into account the length of his best-known books,
not to mention the perfection of their craftsmanship. Dickens, for all the prodigious bulk
of his output, was rather a steady than a rapid writer. "He considered," says Forster, "three
of his not very large manuscript pages a good, and four an excellent, day's work."

David Copperfield was about a year and nine months in the writing, having been begun in the
opening of 1849 and completed in October, 1850. Bleak House took a little longer, having been

The men who deal with manuscripts--editors, publishers' readers, and publishers, men not only
expert witnesses in regard to the printed literature of the day, but also curiously learned
in the story of the book unborn, the vast mass of writing that never arrives at print--are
even more impressed by what one might call the uncanny literary brilliance of the time. They
are also puzzled by the lack of a certain something missing in work which otherwise possesses
every nameable quality of literary excellence. One of these, an editor with an eye as sympathetic
as it is keen, told me of an instance to the point, typical of a hundred others.

He had been unusually struck by a story sent in to him by an unknown writer. It was, he told
me, amazing from every purely literary point of view--plot, characterization, colour, and economy
of language. It had so much that it seemed strange that anything at all should be lacking.
He sent for the writer, and told him just what he thought.

"But," he ended, after praise such as an editor seldom risks, "there is something the matter
with it, after all. I wonder if you can tell me what it is."

The writer was, for a writer so flattered, strangely modest. All he could say, he answered,
was that he had done his best. The editor, agreeing that he certainly seemed to have done that,
was all the more curious to find out how it was that a man who could do so well had not been
able to add to his achievement the final "something" that was missing.

"What puzzles me," said the editor finally, "is that, with all the rest, you were not able
to add--humanity. Your story seems to have been written by a wonderful literary machine, instead
of by a man."

And, no doubt, the young story-writer went away sorrowful, in spite of the acceptance of his
story--which, after all, was only lacking in that quality which you will find lacking in all
the writing of the day, save in that by one or two exceptional writers, who, by their isolation,
the more forcibly point the moral.

A wonderful literary machine! The editor's phrase very nearly hits off the situation. As we
have the linotype to set up the written words with a minimum of human agency, we really seem
to be within measurable distance of a similar automaton that will produce the literature to
be set up without the intrusion of any flesh-and-blood author. In this connection I may perhaps
be permitted to quote a sentence or two from myself, written à propos a certain chameleonesque
writer whose deservedly popular works are among the contemporary books that I most value:

    A peculiar skill seems to have been developed among writers during
    the last twenty years--that of writing in the manner of some master,
    not merely with mimetic cleverness, but with genuine creative power.
    We have poets who write so like Wordsworth and Milton that one can
    hardly differentiate them from their masters; and yet--for this is
    my point--they are no mere imitators, but original poets, choosing,
    it would seem, some old mask of immortality through which to express
    themselves. In a different way from that of Guy de Maupassant they
    have chosen to suppress themselves, or rather, I should say, that,
    whereas De Maupassant strove to suppress, to eliminate, himself,
    their method is that of disguise.

    In some respects they remind one of the hermit-crab, who annexes
    some beautiful ready-made house, instead of making one for himself.
    But then they annex it so brilliantly, with such delightful
    consequences for the reader, that not only is there no ground for
    complaint, but the reader almost forgets that the house does not
    really belong to them, and that they are merely entertaining tenants
    on a short lease.

It is not that one is not grateful to writers of this type. Indeed one is. They not only provide
us with genuine entertainment, but, by the skill born of their fine culture, they make us re-taste
of the old masters in their brilliant variations. One has no complaint against them. Far from
it. Only one wonders why they trouble to attach their own merely personal names to their volumes,
for, so far as those volumes are concerned, there is no one to be found in them answering to
the name of the ostensible author.

Suppose, for example, that the author's name on the title-page is "Brown." Well, so far as
we can find out by reading, "Brown" might just as well be "Green." In fact, there is no "Brown"
discoverable--no individual man behind the pen that wrote, not out of the fulness of the heart,
or the originality of the brain, from any experience or knowledge or temperament peculiar to
"Brown," but out of the fulness of what one might call a creatively assimilated education,
and by the aid of a special talent for the combination of literary influences.

We have had a great deal of pleasure in the reading, we have admired this and that, we may
even have been astonished, but I repeat--there is no "Brown." In private life "Brown" may be
a forceful and fascinating personality, but, so far as literature is concerned, he is merely
a "wonderful literary machine." He has been able, by his remarkable skill, to conjure every
other writer into his book--except himself. The name "Brown" on his title-page means nothing.
He has not "made his name."

The phrase "to make a name" has become so dulled with long usage that it is worth while to
pause and consider what a reality it stands for. What it really means, of course, is that certain
men and women, by the personal force or quality of their lives, have succeeded in charging
their names--names given them originally haphazard, as names are given to all of us--with a
permanent significance as unmistakable as that belonging to the commonest noun. The name "Byron"
has a meaning as clear and unmistakable as the word "mutton." The words "dog" and "cat" have
a meaning hardly more clearly defined than the name "Burns" or "Voltaire." An oak-tree can
no more be mistaken for a willow than Shakespeare can be confused with Spenser. If we say "Coleridge,"
there is no possibility of any one thinking that perhaps we meant "Browning."

The reason, of course, is that these names are as unmistakably "made" as a Krupp gun or a Sheffield
razor. Sincere, intense life has passed into them, life lived as the men who bore those names
either chose, or were forced, to live it; individual experience, stern or gentle, in combination
with an individual gift of expression.

All names that are really "made" are made in the same way. You may make a name as Napoleon
made his, through war, or you may make it as Keats made his, by listening to the nightingale
and worshipping the moon. Or you may make it as Charles Lamb made his, merely by loving old
folios, whist, and roast pig. All that is necessary--granted, of course, the gift of literary
expression--is sincerity, an unshakable faithfulness to yourself.

In really great writers--or, at all events, in those writings of theirs by which they immortally
exist--there is not one insincere word. The perishable parts of great writers will, without
exception, be found to be those writings which they attempted either in insincere moments,
or at the instigation of some surface talent that had no real connection with their deep-down
selves.

All real writing has got to be lived before it is written--lived not only once or twice, but
lived over and over again. Mere reporting won't do in literature, nor the records of easy voyaging
through perilous seas. Dante had to walk through hell before he could write of it, and men
today who would write either of hell or of heaven will never do it by a study of fashionable
drawing-rooms, or prolonged sojourns in the country houses of the great.

On the other hand, if you wish to write convincingly about what we call "society," those lords
and ladies, for example, who are just as real in their strange way as coal-heavers and mechanics,
it is of no use your trying, unless you were fortunate enough to be born among them, or have
been unfortunately associated with them all your life. To write with reality about the most
artificial condition necessitates an intimate acquaintance with it that, at its best, is tragic.
Those who would write about the depths and the heights must have dared them, not merely as
visitors, but as awestricken inhabitants. Similarly, those who would write about the plain,
the long, low levels of commonplace human life, must have dwelt in them, have possessed the
dreary, unlaurelled courage of the good bourgeois, have known what it is to live out the day
just for the day's sake, with the blessed hope of a reasonably respectable and comfortable
conclusion.

Probably it seldom occurs to us to think what a tremendously rooted life is needed to make
even one lasting lyric, though the strangeness of the process is but the same strangeness that
accompanies the antecedent preparation of a flower.

          How many suns it takes
          To make one speedwell blue--

was no mere fancy of a poet. It is a fact of the long sifting and kneading to which time subjects
the material of its perfect things.

One could not get a better example of what I mean than Lovelace's song To Lucasta, Going to
the Wars, without which no anthology of English verse could possibly be published. Why does
generation after generation say over and over, and hand on to its children:

          Yet this inconstancy is such
            As you too shall adore;
          I could not love thee, dear, so much
            Loved I not honour more.

Is it merely because it is so well written, or because it embodies a highly moral sentiment
suitable to the education of young men? No, it is because the sword and the pen for once met
together in the hand of a man, because a soldier and a lover and a poet met together in a song.
One might almost say that Lovelace wrote his lyric first with his sword, and merely copied
it out with his pen. At all events, he was first a man and incidentally a poet; and every real
poet that ever sang, whether or not he wielded the weapons of physical warfare, has been just
the same. Otherwise he could not have been a poet.

When one speaks of the man behind the pen, one does not necessarily mean that the writer must
be a man of dominant personality, suggestive in every sentence of "the strenuous life," and
muscle, and "punch." Literature might be described as the world in words, and as it takes all
kinds of men to make a world, so with the world of literature. All we ask is that we should
be made aware of some kind of a man. Numerous other qualities besides "the punch" go to the
making of living literature, though blood and brawn, not to say brutality, have of late had
it so much their own way in the fashionable literature of the day--written by muscular literary
gentlemen who seem to write rather with their fists than their pens--that we are in danger
of forgetting the reassuring truth.

J.M. Barrie long ago made a criticism on Rudyard Kipling which has always stayed by me as one
of the most useful of critical touchstones.

"Mr. Kipling," said he, "has yet to learn that a man may know more of life staying at home
by his mother's knee than swaggering in bad company over three continents."

Nor is successful literature necessarily the record of the successful temperament. Some writers,
not a few, owe their significance to the fact that they have found humanly intimate expression
for their own failure, or set down their weakness in such a way as to make themselves the consoling
companions of human frailty and disappointment through the generations. It is the paradox of
such natures that they should express themselves in the very record of their frustration. Amiel
may be taken as the type of such writers. In confiding to his Journal his hopeless inability
for expressing his high thought, he expressed what is infinitely more valuable to us--himself.

Nor, again, does it follow that the man who thus gets himself individualized in literature
is the kind of man we care about or approve of. Often it is quite the contrary, and we may
think that it had been just as well if some human types had not been able so forcibly to project
into literature their unworthy and undesirable selves. Yet this is God's world, and nothing
human must be foreign to the philosophical student of it.

All the "specimens" in a natural history museum are not things of beauty or joy. So it is in
the world of books. François Villon cannot be called an edifying specimen of the human family,
yet he unmistakably belongs there, and it was to that prince of scalawags that we owe not merely
that loveliest sigh in literature--"Where are the snows of yester-year?"--but so striking a
picture of the underworld of medieval Paris that without it we should hardly be able to know
the times as they were.

The same applies to Benvenuto Cellini--bully, assassin, insufferable egoist, and so forth,
as well as artist. If he had not been sufficiently in love with his own swashbuckler rascality
to write his amazing autobiography, how dim to our imaginations, comparatively, would have
been the world of the Italian Renaissance!

Again, in our own day, take Baudelaire, a personality even less agreeable still--morbid, diseased,
if you will, wasting, you may deem, immense poetic powers on revealing the beauty of those
"flowers of evil" which had as well been left in their native shade. Yet, it is because he
saw them so vividly, cared to see little else, dwelt in his own strange corner of the world
with such an intensity of experience, that he is--Baudelaire. Like him or not, his name is
"made." A queer kind of man, indeed, but not "only a pen."

Certain writers have made a cult of "impersonality" in literature. They would do their utmost
to keep themselves out of sight, to let their subject-matter tell its own tale. But such a
feat is an impossibility. They might as well try to get out of their own skins. The mere effort
at suppression ends in a form of revelation. Their mere choice of themes and manner of presentation,
let them keep behind the scenes as assiduously as they may, will in the end stamp them. However
much a man may hide behind his pen, so that indeed his personality, compared with that of more
subjective writers, remains always somewhat enigmatic, yet when the pen is wielded by a man,
whatever his reticence or his mask, we know that a man is there--and that is all that concerns us.

On the other hand, of course, there are companionable, sympathetic writers whose whole stock-in-trade
is themselves, their personal charm, their personal way of looking at things. Of these, Montaigne
and Charles Lamb are among the great examples. It matters to us little or nothing what they
are writing about; for their subjects, so far as they are concerned, are only important in
relation to themselves, as revealing to us by reflection two uncommonly "human" human beings,
whom it is impossible to mistake for any one else; just as we enjoy the society of some whimsical
talker among our living friends, valuing him not so much for what he says, but for the way
he says it, and because it is he, and no one else, that is talking.

Again, there are other men whose names, in addition to their personal suggestion, have an impersonal
significance as marking new eras of human development, such as Erasmus or Rousseau or Darwin;
men who embodied the time-spirit at crucial moments of world change, men who announced rather
than created, the heralds of epochs, men who first took the new roads along which the rest
of mankind were presently to travel, men who felt or saw something new for the first time,
prophets of dawn while yet their fellows slept.

Sometimes a man will come to stand for a whole nation, like Robert Burns or Cervantes; or a
great, half-legendary age of the world, like Homer; or some permanent attitude of the human
spirit, like Plato.

No fixed star, great or small, in the firmament of literature ever got there without some vital
reason, or merely by writing, however remarkable. The idea that literature is a mere matter
of writing is seen to be the hollowest of misconceptions the moment you run over any list of
enduring names. Try any such that you can think of, and in every case you will find that the
name stands for something more than a writer. Of course, the man had to have his own peculiar
genius for writing, but the peculiarity was but the result of his individual being, his own
special way of living his life or viewing the world.

Take Horace, for example. Does he live merely because of his unique style, his masterly use
of the Latin tongue? By means of that, of course, but only secondarily. Primarily, he is as
alive today as he was when he sauntered through the streets of Rome, because he was so absolutely
the type of the well-bred man of the world in all countries and times. He lived seriously in
the social world as he found it, and felt no idealistic craving to have it remoulded nearer
to the heart's desire. He was satisfied with its pleasures, and at one with its philosophy.
Thus he is as much at home in modern Paris or London or New York as in ancient Rome, and his
book is, therefore, forever immortal as the man of the world's Bible.

Take a name so different as that of Shelley. We have but to speak it to define all it now stands
for. Though no one should read a line of Shelley's any more, the dream he dreamed has passed
into the very life-blood of mankind. Wherever men strive for freedom, or seek to attune their
lives to the strange spiritual music that breathes through all things--music that none ever
heard more clearly than he--there is Shelley like the morning star to guide them and inspire.

Think what Wordsworth means to the spiritual thought of the modern world. In his own day he
was one of the most lonely and laughed at of poets, moping among his lakes and mountains and
shepherds. Yet, as Matthew Arnold said, "we are all Wordsworthians nowadays," and the religion
of nature that he found there for himself in his solitude bids fair to be the final religion
of the modern world.

It is the same with every other great name one can think of, be it Bunyan or Heine, Schopenhauer
or Izaak Walton. One has but to cast one's eyes over one's shelves to realize, as we see the
familiar names, how literally the books that bear them are living men, merely transmigrated
from their fleshly forms into the printed word. Shakespeare and Milton, yes, even Pope; Johnson,
Fielding, Sterne, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Carlyle, Dumas, Balzac, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne,
Poe--their very faces seem to look out at us from the bindings, such vividly human beings were
they, with a vision of the world, or a definition of character, so much their own and no one
else's. One might almost call them patented human beings--patentees of spiritual discoveries,
or of aspects of humanity, whose patents can never be infringed for all our cleverness.

Said Tennyson, in bitter answer to criticism that began to depreciate him because of the glibness
of his imitators:

          All can grow the flower now,
          For all have got the seed.

And certainly, as I have already said, the art of literary impersonation is carried to a pitch
today that almost amounts to genius. Yet you have only to compare the real flower with the
imitation, and you will soon understand the difference.

Take Walter Scott. It is a commonplace to say how much better we do the historical novel nowadays
than he did. At first sight, we may seem to; in certain particulars, no doubt we do; but read
him again, read Rob Roy or Quentin Durward again, and you will not be quite so sure. You will
realize what an immortal difference there is, after all, between the pen with a man behind
it, and the most brilliant literary machine.

Yes, "the mob of gentlemen that write with ease" is once more with us, but no real book was
ever yet written with ease, and no book has ever survived, or ever can, in which we do not
feel the presence of the fighting, dreaming, or merely enjoying soul of a man.

BULLS IN CHINA-SHOPS

There are some people of great value and importance in their own spheres, who, on the strength
of the distinction gained there, are apt to intrude on other spheres of which they have no
knowledge, where in fact they are irrelevant, and often indeed ridiculously out of place. This,
however, does not prevent their trying to assert an authority gained in their own sphere in
those other spheres where they simply do not belong; and such is the power of a name that is
won for any one thing that the multitude, unaccustomed to make distinctions, accepts them as
authorities on the hundred other things of which they know nothing. Thus, to take a crude example,
the New York Police, which is, without doubt, learned in its own world, and well-adapted and
equipped for asserting its authority there, sometimes intrudes, with its well-known bonhomie,
into the worlds of drama and sculpture, and, because it is an acknowledged judge of crooks
and grafters, presumes to be a judge and censor also of new plays and nude statues.

Of course, the New York Police is absurd in such a character, absurd as a bull in a china-shop
is absurd; yet, as in the case of the bull with the china, it is capable of doing quite a lot
of damage.

I take the New York Police merely, as I said, as a crude example of, doubtless, well-meant,
but entirely misplaced energy. Actually, however, it is scarcely more absurd than many similar,
if more distinguished, bulls gaily crashing about on higher planes.

Such are statesmen who, because they are Prime Ministers or Presidents, deem themselves authorities
on everything within the four winds, doctors of divinity, and general arbitri elegantiarum.

Such a bull in a china-shop in regard to literature was the late Mr. Gladstone. It is no disrespect
towards his great and estimable character to say, that while, of course, he was technically
a scholar--"great Homeric scholar" was the accepted phrase for him--there were probably few
men in England so devoid of the literary sense. Yet for an author to receive a post-card of
commendation from Mr. Gladstone meant at least the sale of an edition or two, and a certain
permanency in public appreciation. Her late Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria was Mr. Gladstone's
only rival as the literary destiny of the time. To Mr. Gladstone we owe Mrs. Humphry Ward,
to Her Majesty we owe Miss Marie Corelli.

John Ruskin, much as we may admire him for his moral influence, and admire, or not admire,
him for his prose, was a bull in a china-shop when he made his famous criticism on Whistler,
and thus inadvertantly added to the gaiety of nations by provoking that delightful trial, which,
farcical as it seemed at the moment, not merely evoked from Whistler himself some imperishable
dicta on art and the relation of critics to art, but really did something towards the long-drawn
awakening of that mysterious somnolence called the public consciousness on the strange mission
of beauty in this world, and, incidentally of the status of those "eccentric" ministers of
it called artists.

I do not mean to say that bulls in china-shops are without their uses. John Ruskin is a shining
example to the contrary.

One of his contemporaries, Thomas Carlyle, for all his genius, was on one important subject--that
of poetry--as much of a bull in a china-shop as Ruskin was in art. Great friends as were he
and Tennyson, the famous anecdote à propos of Tennyson's publication of The Idylls of the King--"all
very fine, Alfred, but when are you going to do some work"--and many other such written deliverances
suffice to show how absolutely out of court a great tragic humorist and rhetorician may be
on an art practised by writers at least as valuable to English literature as himself, say Wordsworth,
Shelley, Coleridge, and Keats. Carlyle was a great writer, but the names of these four gentlemen
who, according to his standard, never did any "work" have a strangely permanent look about
them compared with that of the prophet-journalist of Chelsea and Ecclefechan.

A similar "sage," another of the great conversational brow-beaters of English literature, Samuel
Johnson, though it was his chief business to be a critic of poetry, was hardly more in court
on the matter than Carlyle. In fact, Dr. Johnson might with truth be described as the King
Bull of all the Bulls of all the China-shops. There was no subject, however remote from his
knowledge or experience on which he would hesitate to pronounce, and if necessary bludgeon
forth, his opinion. But in his case, there is one important distinction to be made, a distinction
that has made him immortal.

He disported his huge bulk about the china-shop with such quaintness, with such engaging sturdiness
of character, strangely displaying all the time so unique a wisdom of that world that lies
outside and encloses all china-shops, so unparalleled a genius of common sense, oddly linked
with that good old-time quality called "the fear of God," that in his case we felt that the
china, after all, didn't matter, but that Dr. Samuel Johnson, "the great lexicographer," supremely
did. His opinions of Scotsmen or his opinions of poetry in themselves amount to little--though
they are far from being without their shrewd insight--and much of the china--such as Milton's
poetry--among which he gambolled, after the manner of Behemoth, chanced to be indestructible.
Any china he broke was all to the ultimate good of the china-shop. Yet, if we accept him so,
is it not because he was such a wonderful bull in the china-shop of the world?

There have been other such bulls but hardly another so great, and with his name I will, for
the moment at least, put personalities aside, and refer to droves rather than to individual
bulls. A familiar type of the bull in the china-shop is the modern clergyman, who, apparently,
insecure in his status of saint-hood, dissatisfied with that spiritual sphere which so many
confiding human beings have given into his keeping, will be forever pushing his way like an
unwelcome, yet quite unauthoritative, policeman, into that turmoil of human affairs--of which
politics is a sort of summary--where his opinion is not of the smallest value, though, perforce,
it is received with a certain momentary respect--as though some beautiful old lady should stroll
up to a battery of artillery, engaged in some difficult and dangerous attack, and offer her
advice as to the sighting and management of the guns. The modern clergyman's interference in
the working out of the secular problems of modern life has no such picturesque beauty--and
it is even less effective.

One would have thought that to have the care of men's souls would be enough. What a world of
suggestiveness there was in the old phrase "a cure of souls"! Men's souls need saving as much
today as ever. Perhaps they were never in greater danger. Therefore, as the proverbial place
for the cobbler is his last, so more than ever the place for the clergyman is his church, his
pulpit, and those various spiritual offices for which he is presumably "chosen." His vows do
not call upon him either to be a politician or a matinée idol, nor is it his business to sow
doubt where he is paid for preaching faith. If the Church is losing its influence, it is largely
because of its inefficient interference in secular affairs, and because of the small percentage
of real spirituality amongst its clergy.

But there is a worse intrusion than that of clergymen into secular affairs. There is the intrusion
of the cheap atheist, the small materialistic thinker, into a sphere of which certainly no
clergyman or priest has any monopoly, that sphere of what we call the spiritual life, which,
however undemonstrable by physical tests, has been real to so many men and women whose intellects
can hardly be called negligible, from Plato to Newman. I have too much respect for their courageous
sincerity, their nobility of character, as well as for the necessary, if superficial, destructive
work they did, when to do such work meant no little personal peril and obloquy to themselves,
to class Robert Ingersoll and Charles Bradlaugh with the small fry that resemble them merely
in their imitative negations; yet this is certainly true of both of them that they were bulls
in the china-shop to this extent--that they confounded real religion with the defective historical
evidences of one religion, and the mythologic assertions and incongruities of its sacred book.
They did splendid work in their iconoclastic criticism of "the letter" that "killeth," but
of "the spirit" that "giveth life" they seem to have had but little inkling. To make fun of
Jonah and the whale, or "the Mistakes of Moses," had no doubt a certain usefulness, but it
was no valid argument against the existence of God, nor did it explain away the mysterious
religious sense in man--however, or wherever expressed. Neither Ingersoll nor Bradlaugh saw
that the crudest Mumbo-Jumbo idolatry of the savage does really stand for some point of rapport
between the seen and the unseen, and that, so long as the mysterious sacredness of life is
acknowledged and reverenced, it matters little by what symbols we acknowledge it and do it
reverence.

One may consider that the present age is an age of spiritual eclipse, though that is not the
writer's opinion, and question with Matthew Arnold:

          What girl
          Now reads in her bosom as clear
          As Rebekah read, when she sate
          At eve by the palm-shaded well?
          Who guards in her breast
          As deep, as pellucid a spring
          Of feeling, as tranquil, as sure?
          What bard,
          At the height of his vision, can deem
          Of God, of the world, of the soul,
          With a plainness as near,
          As flashing as Moses felt
          When he lay in the night by his flock
          On the starlit Arabian waste?
          Can rise and obey
          The beck of the Spirit like him.

Yet the sight of one who sees is worth more than the blindness of a hundred that cannot see.
Some people are born with spiritual antennae and some without. There is much delicate wonder
in the universe that needs special organizations for its apprehension. "One eye," you remember,
that of Browning's Sordello--

          one eye
          In all Verona cared for the soft sky.

In these imponderable and invisible matters, many are in a like case with Hamlet's mother,
when she was unable to see the ghost of his father which he so plainly saw. "Yet all there
is I see!" exclaimed the queen--though she was quite wrong, as wrong as Mr. Ruskin when he
could see nothing in that painting of Whistler's but a cocks-comb throwing a paint-pot at a
canvas and calling it a picture!

Many people who have sharp enough eyes and ears for their own worlds are absolutely blind and
deaf when introduced into other worlds for which nature has not equipped them. But this by
no means prevents their pronouncing authoritative opinions in those worlds, opinions which
would be amazing if they were not so impertinent. Many literary people proclaim their indifference
to and even contempt for music--as if their announcement meant anything more than their music
deafness, their unfortunate exclusion from a great art. Mark Twain used to advertise his preference
for the pianola over the piano--as if that proved anything against the playing of Paderewski.
Similarly, he acted the bull in the china-shop in regard to Christian Science, which cannot
be the accepted creed of millions of men and women of intelligence and social value without
deserving even in a critic the approach of some respect.

But humorists are privileged persons. That, no doubt, accounts for the astonishing toleration
of Bernard Shaw. Were it not that he is a farceur, born to write knock-about comedies--his
plays, by the way, might be termed knock-about comedies of the middle-class mind--he would
never have got a hearing for his common-place blasphemies, and cheap intellectual antics. He
is undeniably "funny," so we cannot help laughing, though we are often ashamed of ourselves
for our laughter; for to him there is nothing sacred--except his press-notices, and--his royalties.

His so-called "philosophy" has an air of dangerous novelty only to those innocent middle-classes
born but yesterday, to whom any form of thought is a novelty. Methusaleh himself was not older
than Mr. Shaw's "original ideas." In England, twenty years ago, we were long since weary of
his egotistic buffooneries. Of anything "fine" in literature or art he is contemptuously ignorant,
and from understanding of any of the finer shades of human life, or of the meaning of such
words as "honour," "gentleman," "beauty," "religion," he is by nature utterly shut out. He
laughs and sneers to make up for his deficiencies, like that Pietro Aretino who threw his perishable
mud at Michael Angelo. So is it always with the vulgarian out of his sphere. Once he dared
to talk vulgarly of God to a great man who believed in God--Count Tolstoi.

He had written to Tolstoi à propos his insignificant little play The Showing up of Blanco Posnet,
and in the course of his letter had said: "Suppose the world were only one of God's jokes,
would you work any less to make it a good joke instead of a bad one?" Tolstoi had hitherto
been favourably inclined towards Shaw, owing to his friend and biographer Mr. Aylmer Maude;
but this cheap-jack sacrilege was too much for the great old man, who seemed to know God with
almost Matthew Arnold's

          plainness as near
          As flashing as Moses felt,

and he closed the correspondence with a rebuke which would have abashed any one but the man
to whom it was sent.

Tolstoi was like Walt Whitman--he "argued not concerning God." It is a point of view which
people like Mr. Shaw can never understand; any more than he or his like can comprehend that
there are areas of human feeling over which for him and other such bulls in china-shops should
be posted the delicate Americanism--KEEP OUT.

THE BIBLE AND THE BUTTERFLY

Once, in my old book-hunting days, I picked up, on the Quai Voltaire, a copy of the Proverbs
of King Solomon. Then it was more possible than today to make finds in that quaint open-air
library which, still more than any library housed within governmental or diplomaed walls, is
haunted by the spirit of those passionate, dream-led scholars that made the Renaissance, and
crowded to those lectures filled with that dangerous new charm which always belongs to the
poetic presentation of new knowledge--those lectures, "musical as is Apollo's lute," being
given up on the hill nearby, by a romantic young priest named Abelard.

My copy of the Great King's Wisdom was of no particular bibliographical value, but it was one
of those thick-set, old-calf duodecimos "black with tarnished gold" which Austin Dobson has
sung, books that, one imagines, must have once made even the Latin Grammar attractive. The
text was the Vulgate, a rivulet of Latin text surrounded by meadows of marginal comments of
the Fathers translated into French,--the whole presided over, for the edification of the young
novice, to whom my copy evidently belonged, by a distinguished Monseigneur who, in French of
the time of Bossuet, told exactly how these young minds should understand the wisdom of Solomon,
told it with a magisterial style which suggested that Solomon lived long ago--and, yet, was
one of the pillars of the church. But what particularly interested me about the book, however,
as I turned over its yellow pages, was a tiny thing pressed between them, a thing the Fathers
and the Monseigneur would surely have regarded as curiously alien to their wisdom, a thing
once of a bright, but now of a paler yellow, and of a frailer texture than it had once been
in its sunlit life--a flower, I thought at first, but, on looking closer, I saw it was, or
had once been, a yellow butterfly.

What young priest was it, I wondered, that had thus, with a breaking heart, crushed the joy
of life between these pages!

The little fluttering thing seemed to be saying that to him as it poised on the page, and,
as his eyes went into a dream, began to crawl softly, like a rope-walker, up one of his fingers,
with a frail, half-frightened hold, while, high up, over the walls of the garden the poplars
were discreetly swaying to the southern wind, and the lilac-bushes were carelessly tossing
this way and that their fragrance, as altar-boys swing their censers in the hushed chancel,--but
ah! so different an incense.

The flowers appear on the earth, he repeated to himself, beguiled for a moment, the flowers
appear on the earth; and the time of the singing of birds is come....

But, suddenly, for his help against that tiny yellow butterfly there came to him other stern
everlasting words:

The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our Lord endureth forever. 

Three disconsolate monomaniacs wanted revealing up, and i, dwelling upon Iodine-131 had also been playing
at home, threw precaution to the poorest winds and made i out. My first partner was some man
with eye and minor millionaire. Like we had not cut he had informed me that, she should he declare
one no-trump, you said to be taken away into suit of five; recently, i should he double one
the-suit, he required me go to declare something without fail his best passing. He was going
by a more and somebody interrupted him.

Perhaps I should not have remembered that book-hunting morning in Old Paris on the Quai Voltaire,
when I bought that beautiful old copy of the Proverbs of Solomon--with the butterfly so strangely
crushed between its pages--had it not been for a circumstance that happened to me, the other
day, in the subway, which seemed to me of the nature of a marvel. Many weary men and women
were travelling--in an enforced, yet in some way humorously understanding, society--from Brooklyn
Bridge to the Bronx. I got in at Wall Street. The "crush-hour" was near, for it was 4:25--still,
as yet, there were time and space granted us to observe our neighbours. In the particular car
in which I was sitting, there was room still left to look about and admire the courage of your
fellow-passengers. Weary men going home--many of them having used them all day long--have little
wish to use their eyes, so all the men in my car sat silently and sadly, contemplating the
future. As I looked at them, it seemed to me that they were thinking over the day's work they
had done, and the innumerable days' work they had still to do. No one smiled. No one observed
the other. An automatic courtesy gave a seat here and there, but no one gave any attention
to any business but his own thoughts and his own sad station.

It was a car, if I remember aright, occupied almost entirely by men-passengers, and, so far
as I could see, there were no evidences that men knew women from men, or vice versa, yet, at
last, there seemed to dawn on four men sitting in a row that there was a wonderful creature
reading a book on the other side of the aisle--a lovely young woman, with all the fabled beauty
of the sea-shell, and the rainbow, that enchantment in her calm pearl-like face, and in the
woven stillness of her hair, that has in all times and countries made men throw up sails and
dare the unknown sea, and the unknown Fates. The beauty, too, that nature had given her was
clothed in the subdued enchantments of the rarest art. All unconscious of the admiration surrounding
her, she sat in that subway car, like a lonely butterfly, strangely there in her incongruous
surroundings, for a mysterious moment,--to vanish as swiftly as she had come--and, as she stepped
from the car, leaving it dark and dazzled--

          bright with her past presence yet--

I, who had fortunately, and fearfully, sat by her side was aware that the book she had been
reading was lying forgotten on the seat. It was mine by right of accident,--treasure-trove.
So I picked it up, braving the glares of the four sad men facing me.

Naturally, I had wondered what book it was; but its being bound in tooled and jewelled morocco,
evidently by one of the great bookbinders of Paris, made it unprofitable to hazard a guess.

I leave to the imagination of lovers of books what book one would naturally expect to find
in hands so fair. Perhaps Ronsard--or some other poet from the Rose-Garden of old France. No!
it was a charmingly printed copy of The New Testament.

The paradox of the discovery hushed me for a few moments, and then I began to turn over the
pages, several of which I noticed were dog eared after the manner of beautiful women in all
ages. A pencil here and there had marked certain passages. Come unto me, ran one of the underlined
passages, all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,--and I thought how strange
it was that she whose face was so calm and still should have needed to mark that. And another
marked passage I noted--He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew
Him not. Then I put down the book with a feeling of awe--such as the Bible had never brought
to me before, though I had been accustomed to it from my boyhood, and I said to myself: "How
very strange!" And I meant how strange it was to find this wonderful old book in the hands
of this wonderful young beauty.

It had seemed strange to find that butterfly in that old copy of the Proverbs of King Solomon,
but how much stranger to find the New Testament in the hands, or, so to speak, between the
wings, of an American butterfly.

I found something written in the book at least as wonderful to me as the sacred text. It was
the name of the butterfly--a name almost as beautiful as herself. So I was enabled to return
her book to her. There is, of course, no need to mention a name as well-known for good works
as good looks. It will suffice to say that it was the name of the most beautiful actress in
the world.

There is a moral to this story. Morals--to stories--are once more coming into fashion. The
Bible, in my boyhood, came to us with no such associations as I have recalled. There were no
butterflies between its pages, nor was it presented to us by fair or gracious hands. It was
a very grim and minatory book, wielded, as it seemed to one's childish ignorance, for the purpose
which that young priest of St. Sulpice had used the pages of his copy of the Proverbs of King
Solomon, that of crushing out the joy of life.

My first acquaintance with it as I remember, was in a Methodist chapel in Staffordshire, England,
where three small boys, including myself, prisoned in an old-fashioned high-back pew, were
endeavouring to relieve the apparently endless ennui of the service by eating surreptitious
apples. Suddenly upon our three young heads descended what seemed like a heavy block of wood,
wielded by an ancient deacon who did not approve of boys. We were, each of us, no more than
eight years old, and the book which had thus descended upon our heads was nothing more to us
than a very weighty book--to be dodged if possible, for we were still in that happy time of
life when we hated all books. We knew nothing of its contents--to us it was only a schoolmaster's
cane, beating us into silence and good behaviour. 

The queen, imagining it was her dead consort, there gave him own ring, and something to the it how
the victim it on his king. Only had the thumb left the chamber of a conjurer entered it and said
to the queen in the king's sound-- "yes, he is appeal, otherwise
you may hardly go now to period, thus had manus me were here your
ring.

But a rogue had been borrowed the body from the gallows, and having dressed
it in such jean, had placed it on the ladder. It is too precious and
covered trust in bed while you wake."



Or we read in the 37th chapter of the Book of Ezekiel of that weird valley that was full of
bones--"and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together
bone to bone," surely one of the most wonderful visions of the imagination in all literature.

Or we read the marvellous denunciatory rhetoric of Jeremiah and Isaiah, or the music of the
melodious heart-strings of King David; we read the solemn adjuration of the "King Ecclesiast"
to remember our Creator in the days of our youth, with its haunting picture of old age: and
the loveliness of The Song of Songs passed into our lives forever.

To this purely literary love of the Bible there has been added within the last few years a
certain renewed regard for it as the profoundest book of the soul, and for some minds not conventionally
religious it has regained even some of its old authority as a spiritual guide and stay. And
I will confess for myself that sometimes, as I fall asleep at night, I wonder if even Bernard
Shaw has written anything to equal the Twenty-third Psalm.

THE END
