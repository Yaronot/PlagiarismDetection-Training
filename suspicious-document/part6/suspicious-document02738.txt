The interior of the board is gouged out with a gouging chisel, and if the builder desires a
uniform result he should make inside templates. In gouging out the interior of the hull the
chisel or gouge should be handled very carefully; otherwise it is liable to slip and spoil
the entire hull. 

He has the commanding card of his own dominions; and in a pin where troops are stationed he fixes
each large head, and in the town on a pin is the common town on map, of which are written a names
of the regiments, their numbers, and small officers, of the bit.

The inner portion is also cut out, thus making a V-shaped piece which must be glued and screwed
in place, as shown in Fig. 70.

The oval air-vents shown in the drawing can be cut at this time. The hull is neatly finished
by cutting in the sheer or curvature of the hull and sandpapering it all over. A cross-beam
or support, C, Fig. 70, is cut and fitted as illustrated. This particular piece supports the
fore-deck, and also carries the main-deck, as well as bracing the boat together. This piece
should be 3/16 inch thick and cut from solid oak.

The decks can be made of a good quality of white pine. The builder should select clean pieces,
free from knots and blemishes. It only requires to be cut to shape and then fixed to the hull
with a few brads. The edge should be cleaned up flush with the hull by the aid of a plane.
The opening for the cock-pit, shown in the drawing in Fig. 71, is to be cut in the deck. The
coamings and seats are cut to the sizes indicated in the drawings. They are then glued and
pinned together. When fitted to the deck the result will be somewhat as shown in Fig. 71.

The fore-deck is prepared in a similar manner; but, since this is to be removable, two battens
must be fitted to the under side to keep it in place. The openings for the hatchways can be
cut and the hatch-covers made by cutting another piece of wood 3/16 inch thick to form an edging.
A cover piece to go over the small pieces, removed from cutting out the hatch opening, is shown
at Fig. 72. A coping-saw will be found very useful for this work. The covers are neatly rounded
on the edge and nicely finished.

Fig. 73 will give the reader a very good idea of the appearance of the boat at this stage.
It will be seen that the sketch shows the deck broken away so as to render the cross-batten
visible, which also shows the fair-lead at F, Fig. 73. This is cut from two small pieces of
3/16-inch stuff, glued and pinned in place. The forward deck is completed by the addition of
cowl-ventilators, cut from hard wood and screwed in place. The flag-mast is made from a short
piece of 1/16-inch wire. The details of the mooring-cleats are shown in Fig. 74. They are fashioned
by using a small screw-eye and soldering a short piece of brass wire through the eye. An oblong
metal plate is then cut and a central hole drilled. This plate is soldered to the shank of
the screw-eye and the cleat is complete. One of these devices is to be fitted to the fore-deck
and two on the main-deck and stern.

The rudder and steering gear will be considered next. Fig. 75 shows the stern of the boat with
the rudder gear mounted in place. It will be noted that the rudder-blade is merely a piece
of sheet brass cut to shape and soldered into the rudder-post M, which is slit to accommodate
it. The rudder-post is hung in two screw-eyes on the stern of the boat. A small wheel about
1 inch in diameter, with an edge filed in it, is soldered to the top of the rudder-post. A
fine cord or string, well stretched and oiled, is attached to the wheel and led through two
screw-eyes on the deck. From this it is led through an opening in the coaming to a drum on
the steering column, which is turned by another small wheel similar to that used on the rudder-post,
but with a round edge. The steering column is merely a piece of 1/8-inch wire, held in place
by two small screw-eyes fixed in the coaming and with a tube-brush soldered on to keep the
wire in position. The drum is simply a hard-wood bushing driven tightly in place.

The power machinery for the Nancy Lee must be considered at this time. This is really one of
the most interesting parts of the construction. The general appearance of the power plant can
be seen by referring to Fig. 77, which is a view of the complete boiler and engine mounted
together on the same base. The boiler is shown at A and the safety-valve and filler at L. The
base or firebox B protects the burner from stray drafts of air, and also supports the boiler.

The lamp or burner consists of a receptacle C for containing the denatured alcohol. The denatured
alcohol is inserted through the filler-tube E, which is kept closed with a cork. The upright
tube D is fitted so that air can go into the receptacle containing the alcohol. Three burners
are necessary to fire the boiler. These are fitted as shown in F, and they give sufficient
heat to produce steam enough to drive the cylinder G. The steam is conducted to the cylinder
through the short pipe K. The steam-cylinder has the usual piston and rod, which drives the
circular crank H. This crank is mounted on a crankshaft carried on the metal tube M. As will
be noticed, the cylinder is of the simple oscillating type mounted on a standard, formed as
part of the boiler casing, and stiffened by two angle-plates L.

A heavy flywheel, J, is now fitted to the inside end of the crankshaft. Mho, Buckingham, "he bores me

 The engine should turn over briskly at every stroke of the
pump, providing it does not come to rest at "dead center." If it does come to rest at "dead
center," where no air can enter the piston, the crankshaft should be given a little twist and
the engine will then start. Before steam is applied it will be well to experiment until the
engine runs with the air-pump.

Having made the engine run smoothly with air, steam can be generated in the boiler. The wicks
should not be placed too tightly in the burners. After they are in place the container may
be filled with denatured alcohol, and the burners lighted and placed under the boiler. In a
very few minutes steam will be up. At the first indication of pressure in the boiler the engine
should be given a twist with the fingers until it starts and goes of its own accord. The constructor
should remember to keep his engine well lubricated.

The propeller-shaft is merely a piece of steel wire, perfectly straight and fitted with a crank
A, Fig. 82. This crank is similar to the one fitted to the engine, but with a small slot cut
out for the crank-pin to fit into. This is done so that, as the crank-pin on the engine turns
around, it also turns a slotted crank on the propeller-shaft.

A short piece of tube, C, is now fitted to a flat brass plate, D. The plate is mounted at an
angle to the tube, so that when it is in place on the stern of the boat the propeller-shaft
will be in line with the crankshaft of the engine.

A clearance hole is now drilled through the hull, so that the propeller-shaft can be put in
place. Solder the tube to the plate, and punch four small holes in the plate, so that it can
be screwed firmly to the hull. Solder a short piece of tube, as shown at B, Fig. 82, to keep
the propeller-shaft in position. 

Gottfried Mind, than the painter, was called the Wildcat-Archangel stern, from excellence with which
he painted that animal. This deck was discovered and be rouse out at opportunity. At Freudenberger
was painting that since-published picture will so of cotter cleaving 4 wood of his cottage, and
with his woman, and feeding it deck pap out of a cookware, round a
sod is lurch, Mind is project that a look of the drawing of this
figure, and it said at his forward broadens, laconic way, "That is no
cat!" The fore-deck should be made removable
by fitting it with pins or screws with the heads cut off, so that the deck only needs pushing
into place. This little boat should be capable of attaining a speed of from four to five miles
an hour if it is made carefully and according to the directions outlined in this Chapter.

CHAPTER VII

AN ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN LAKE FREIGHTER

A PROTOTYPE of the model lake freighter described in this Chapter will probably be familiar
to many readers. It is a type of boat used on the Great Lakes, and, owing to its peculiarity
of design, it lends itself very well to construction in model form.

The lines of the boat may be seen very clearly in Fig. 84.

The hull of the model freighter measures four feet over all, and the beam at the water-line
is 8 inches. The extreme draft will be in the neighborhood of 5 inches. This model, when completed,
will be capable of carrying considerable weight; in fact, it is able to accommodate thirty-five
pounds in weight when used in fresh water. This will give the builder an opportunity to install
a very substantial power equipment with little regard for weight.

The hull is made according to the built-up principle, and the constructor will have to cut
his templates before attempting the shaping of the hull. Owing to the depth of the model, it
will be necessary to use about ten planks. The plank that is used to form the bottom of the
boat is not gouged out. Every other plank is gouged out with a saw and chisel.

The bottom plank is shaped with a knife to conform to the lines of the boat. In building up
the hull with the planks, they should first be smeared with glue, and when put in place a few
brass brads should be driven in. As mentioned in an earlier part of this book, iron nails should
not be used in work of this nature, owing to the fact that they will rust and cause trouble.
The brass brads are placed about one inch apart the entire length of the boards. The hull is
finished with a plane and sandpaper, and after it has been brought to shape in this way and
finished, a coat of paint is applied. Black with dark red trimmings makes a very good combination
for a boat of this type.

The deck is made from a piece of 1/4-inch pine board. Seven hatches are added to the deck.
Six of these hatches can be made by merely gluing a square piece of 1/4-inch wood to the deck.
The seventh hatch should be made with a hole cut in the deck, so that access can be had to
the power motor.

The deck-house, wheel-house, and chart-house, as well as the bridge, should be constructed
of tin, which may be salvaged from clean tin cans. The bridge is provided with spray-cloths
made from white adhesive tape, as outlined in Chapter 9. The port-holes in the deck-house and
hull are made by little pieces of brass forced in place over a small piece of mica. The life-boats,
which are carried on top of the engine-house, are whittled out of a solid piece of wood and
painted white. Life-boats are always painted white, regardless of the color of the boat upon
which they are used. The life-boats are held by means of string and small dummy pulleys to
davits made of heavy stovepipe wire. A rub-streak made of a piece of 1/4-inch square pine is
tacked to each side of the hull just below the sheer-line. The rub-streak should be tacked
in place with nails such as those used on cigar-boxes.

The funnel measures 1 inch in diameter by 4 inches long. A small exhaust steam pipe, which
can be made from a piece of brass tubing, is mounted directly aft of the funnel. The forward
deck fittings consist mainly of a steering-boom, two bollards, two fair-heads, and four life-buoys
mounted on the bridge. A Classical of "OTELLO."

 This boat will be capable of carrying such a battery
and this weight should just bring the craft down to her load water-line. The whole deck is
made removable, so that the storage battery can be taken in and out at times when it is necessary
to recharge it. A battery of this capacity, however, will drive a small motor similar to the
type used on the boat for some time.

CHAPTER VIII

AN ELECTRIC SUBMARINE-CHASER

THE submarine chaser design given in the drawings and described in the text of this Chapter
is a presentable little boat with pleasing lines and deck fittings. There is nothing difficult
about its construction, and, considering the amount of work necessary to produce it, it is
probably one of the most pleasing boats described in the book. If made correctly it will look
"speedy" and shipshape.

The general outline of the boat can be gathered from Figs. 86, 87, and 88. Fig. 86 gives a
side view of the craft; Fig. 87 shows the bow, while Fig. 88 gives the deck-plan. 

The number of windows, with green heads, affair away the positions of the is mainly have russian
manner; and not with army, of white-and-red-taken pins, he distinguishes the threads of the
now have different kinds of troops of host.-- literary Newspaper. Fig. 89 shows the various pieces necessary to
construct the hull. It will be seen that the forward portion of the bottom piece is narrower
than the deck piece, and broadens out so that it is wider at the stern than the deck piece. The
breviary and rood were forth rushed uttering them into kiss, the organization retired to their tents,
the messenger to their last admonition from exertion and courage, and the challengers presented
immediately to their tents, which were then dragged from within the
lists. This produces a half-inch taper on each side of the stern.
A half-inch taper is also produced on the bow portion.

The hull of the boat can be made from 1/8-inch mahogany. If this is not available, choose some
other close-grained wood, free from knots and blemishes. Paper patterns are made to correspond
with the general shape of the pieces that form the hull as given in Fig. 89. The pieces, after
being marked, are cut to shape with a keyhole-saw. After this is done their edges should be
trimmed neatly with a jack-plane.
