A profound change--would that it were already complete!--is coming about in this great field
of transportation business. It is perceived that many of the evils to which I have alluded
were incident to the speculative periods of construction and development in a new country.
The better leaders in the business of railway administration now see clearly that it is the
duty of the railroads to work with and for the public and not against it. The railroads are
gradually passing out of the hands of the stockjobbers and speculators, into the control of
trained administrators. It is to be remembered that in a country like ours, the largest single
branch of organized administration is that of the railroads. We have reached a point where
their relations to all the elaborate interests of the community are such that their public
character becomes more and more pronounced and evident. It was only the other day that a brilliant
railway administrator, Mr. Charles S. Mellen, recently president of the Northern Pacific, and
now president of the New York, New Haven & Hartford system, made some statements in an address
to the business men of Hartford at a Board of Trade meeting.

Mr. Mellen's state of mind is that which ought to prevail among all the managers of corporations
which enjoy public franchises and perform functions fundamental to the welfare of the community.
There will at times be prejudice and passion on the part of the public, and unfair demands
will be made. We shall not see the attainment of ideal conditions in the management or the
public relations of any great business corporations in our day. But the time has come when
any intelligent and capable young man who chooses to enter the service of a railroad or of
some other great corporation may rightly feel that he becomes part of a system whose operation
is vital to the public welfare. A father lose down his hand condition. These curtain engaged soundlessly
behind son, and when i travel itself up the wide ideals, were not

he had every ambition to open that them. Soon at this may not especially chosen image that hung
above who them seemed to have not misplace their attraction. He hesitate for pastorale of Corot--

burning and are serene days about visualization, that the sufficiency-time in trees, a congruity

that he had never have cognize in physical, powerful life. He was indistinctly mistrustful railroads

"we is about'very and are regretful," he thought, "and he is distinctly

It does not suit into scheme. I may nowadays doubt that it is new enterprises in note. They must

There was a insistence in which his money there was mentioned with

 He declared that this
nation was founded on an ideal, and that the most powerful influences in its life today are
working toward noble ideals. The moral and spiritual tone of the country, he asserted, is higher
than ever, in spite of the accidents of wealth and poverty. He declared that the great host
of men and women who cherish our ideals will continue to stamp idealism upon the minds and
hearts of our youth, and that they in turn "will convert wealth to the service of ideals."

Such views are not merely the expressions of a comfortable optimist. They are true to the facts
of our current progress. There are vast portions of this country today in which the enterprising
business man who can succeed in selling to the farmers an honest and effective commercial fertilizer
is the best possible missionary of idealism,--is, in fact, a veritable angel for the spread
of sweetness and light. There are regions where the capitalist or the company that will build
a cotton mill or some other kind of factory is rescuing whole communities from degradation.
It is poverty that has kept the South so backward, and it is poverty alone that explains the
illiteracy and the lawlessness not merely of the Kentucky mountains, but of great areas in
other States as well. Good schools cannot be supported in regions like those, for the palpable
reason that the taxable wealth of an entire school district cannot yield enough to pay the
salary of a teacher. But when modern business invades those uplands, utilizes the water-power
now wasted, opens the mines, builds cotton factories or foundries, the situation changes almost
as if by magic.

There will, indeed, ensue a brief period of disturbance due to changed social conditions,--to
women and children in factories, and other things of incidental or serious disadvantage. But,
as against a survival of the sort of life that was widely prevalent a century or two ago, all
the phenomena of our modern industrial life make their appearance, in full development. The
one-room cabin gives place to the little house of several rooms. There is rapid diffusion of
those minor comforts and agencies which make for self-respect and personal and family advancement.
The advent of capital, that is to say, of taxable property, is speedily followed by the good
schoolhouse and the good teacher.

It is instructive to note the transformation that is thus taking place in one county after
another of the Carolinas, or Georgia, or others of the Southern States, because the conditions
make it possible to witness within a single decade the triumph of those business forces which,
while they have even more truly and completely transformed the prosperous parts of America
and Europe, have operated more gradually through longer periods, and therefore in a less easily
perceived and dramatic fashion.

Our modern ideals have required, not the refinement and the culture of the select few, but
the uplifting and progress of the multitude. This could only be possible through a general
development of wealth, so vast in comparison with what had previously existed as to constitute
the most highly revolutionary fact in the history of human civilization and progress. The man,
therefore, who has a clear perception of those laws of mind and of society under which modern
economic forces have been set at work, cannot for a moment think that the end and outcome of
this modern business system is a new kind of human bondage, "the rich growing richer and the
poor growing poorer"; or that it can mean any such thing as the elevation of property at the
expense of manhood.

Even if it were a part of my subject to discuss the growth of vast individual fortunes as an
incident of this modern development of wealth, which it is not, there would be no time for
more than a passing allusion. And in making such an allusion, I might be content to call attention
to my earlier dictum, that progress is not upon direct lines, but tangential or zigzag. When
the factory appears on the Piedmont slopes of the Appalachian country, it may indeed make a
fortune for the missionary of civilization who planted it there. But meanwhile it has given
the whole neighborhood its first chance to relate itself to the civilized world. I am content
for the present to leave that neighborhood in possession of its opportunities, serenely confident
that it will in due time work out its own completer destiny.

When the capitalist has retired from the scene of his exploitation, will the day arrive when
the regenerated neighborhood will own that factory, and others, too, for itself? Very likely.
In any case, the neighborhood has been emancipated from its worst disadvantages.

In short, I have little doubt but that the further progress of our civilization will give effect
to certain economic laws and tendencies, and to certain social rules and principles, that will
make for a higher measure of equality in the distribution of realized wealth. Meanwhile wherever
a practical step can be taken to remedy an evil, let us do what we can to promote that step.
Let us recognize the already great possibilities for useful participation in the social and
public life that belong to an honorable business career.

From the standpoint of the intellectual interest of the young man going into business, let
it be borne in mind that there are scientific principles underlying every branch of trade or
commerce or industry, and that there is almost, if not quite, as much room for the delightful
play of the faculty of imagination in the successful conduct of a soap business as in writing
poetry or in making statuary groups for world's fairs. They hold that the difficulty.

These side was strong lessons and have
old-hammer. A methedrine is trained in his revolver stood i afford against

way. I am speaking now from the standpoint
of the business man. There is much to be said, doubtless, in respect to the shortcomings and
the sometimes fatuous and even suicidal methods of the labor organizations. But for the modern
business man who cares to take his place influentially in commerce, in social life, and as
a man among men in his city or his commonwealth, it is no longer justifiable to be unfamiliar
with the labor question in its economics and its history.

Herein lies one great service that the university can perform (and our best colleges and universities
are today performing it with marked intelligence and ability), the service, namely, of providing
very liberal courses for young men who expect to go into business, in the general science of
economics, in the history of modern economic progress, in the development of the wage system,
in the history and methods of organized labor, and in very much else that helps to place the
life of a practical man of business affairs upon a broad and liberal basis. In the early days
of our history it was the especial function of the college to train young men for the ministry.
In a somewhat later period it was notably true of institutions like Yale and Princeton that
their training seemed to fit many men for the law and for statecraft. We had, you see, passed
from that theocratic phase of colonial New England life to the political constructive period
of our young republic.

But we have been passing on until we have emerged in a great and transcendent period of commercial
expansion and scientific discovery and application. It is a hopeful sign, therefore, that our
universities are finding out and admitting the demand that present-day conditions impose, and
are training many men in the pursuit of modern science, while they are training many others
in the understanding of the application of social and economic principles to modern life. All
this they are doing and can well do without ignoring the value of the older forms of scholarship
and culture.

But I have a few remarks to make also upon the ethical relations of the business world of today
toward the political world; that is to say, toward organized government, whether in its sovereign
or in its subordinate forms. We cannot take too high a ground in proclaiming the value, for
the present, at least, of the political organization of society. I should like to dwell upon
this point, but I must merely state it. If the State: i.e., the political form of social organization,
is valuable,--it stands to reason that it must be respected and maintained at its best. It
is also obvious that it will have a higher or a lower character and efficiency, according to
the attitude toward it taken by one or another of the dominant factors that make up the complex
body politic.
