STONEHENGE:

TO-DAY AND YESTERDAY

STONEHENGE TODAY & YESTERDAY

FOREWORD

The interest that has always attached itself to Stonehenge has, without doubt, been in a great
measure due to the mystery as to the origin of this unique monument of bygone time. But the
careful investigations carried out by the modern school of archæologists, as instanced in the
work of General Pitt Rivers, Mr. Gowland, and others, every excavation being carried out with
great care and scientific accuracy, have had good results; little by little the history of
Stonehenge has been unravelled; a fact that Mr. Stevens has clearly demonstrated in the present
volume. We now know how, when, and who, built this remarkable temple. One point, however, still
remains a mystery, viz. whence the so-called foreign stones were obtained? Clearly, as geology
shows, from no spot in Wiltshire.

Amongst the many rude stone circles scattered over Great Britain, Stonehenge is unique, in
the fact of having its sarsen stones carefully though roughly worked; and also in the introduction
of the horseshoe within the circles, in the design or plan of the building. As in the present
day, our churches, in their design, symbolise the Cross, so we may fairly infer that the horseshoe
at Stonehenge had its own special meaning, as it still has in the East.

I would advise all interested in the subject, after reading Mr. Stevens' lucid and comprehensive
account, to visit this weird monument and judge for themselves; take Omar's sound advice, "To-day"
view the "Dead Yesterday," wait not for the "Unborn To-morrow."

name, but a very wavy tune, and she would keep perhaps good time, and
display her skill.

The lamp would be presently brought in, and they would look
  upon some pictures perhaps. On lively time, some carriage would be announced.
  Perhaps it might be added, "it is coming in to rain." Over hearing'this,
  she would, together, put her pictures aside, and become downcast. He would
  then smooth her due hair, and say, "are you sorry when i am not
