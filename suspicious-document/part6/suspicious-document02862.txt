The 18th November saw Captain Semmes again off Martinique, which he had visited in the Sumter
just twelve months before. Making the north end of the island at about 4 A.M., the propeller
was lowered and steam got up, the day breaking just as the Alabama's screw began to revolve.
At 10 A.M., having run past St. Pierre, she anchored in the harbour of Fort de France.

Here she found her faithful consort, the Agrippina, from whom she had parted at Terceira on
the 24th of August. On her departure from that port, she had returned with all speed to Cardiff,
from which she had again sailed for the rendezvous at Martinique, and was now ready with a
fresh supply of coal for the Alabama, and had been waiting her arrival just eight days. In
addition to the much needed supply of coal, the Agrippina brought a small mail for the Alabama's
officers, who thus received news from friends at home for the first time for more than three
months.

No sooner was the anchor down than a lieutenant was sent ashore to pay the usual visit of ceremony
to the Governor, carrying with him a note, informing his Excellency of the arrival of the Confederate
steamer Alabama in French waters. A few hours brought a courteous reply, extending to the Alabama
the hospitality of the port; and the health officers having visited the ship, arrangements
were made for laying in a stock of provisions, and such other articles as were required after
the cruise. Nor were the amenities of the Alabama's reception confined to the authorities alone.
An enthusiastic greeting awaited her from almost every one; the clubs were placed at their
disposal, and invitations à discretion poured in from every side.

It would, perhaps, have been better for the discipline of the Alabama had the welcome extended
to her crew been somewhat less cordial. Weary of their long confinement, and bent, as the sailor
always seems to be on first putting into port, on a "good spree," a considerable number of
her men fairly succumbed to the hospitality of the worthy islanders, a result that was not
a little aggravated by the exertions of the deserter, Forrest. This man appears to have entertained
a deliberate purpose of exciting a mutiny on board of the vessel, and with this object in view,
managed to slip overboard unobserved, swam to a boat, and returned on board with a quantity
of spirits, which he distributed through the forecastle. The result was a disturbance, which
at one time wore a serious aspect, and which, but for the energy and promptitude of the means
taken to subdue it, might have had very awkward results.

The Captain of the Alabama, however, was not a man to be intimidated or taken off his guard.
No sooner was the disturbance reported than the drums beat to quarters, and the sober portion
of the crew were at once directed to seize the rioters. Placed in double irons, and effectually
drenched with buckets of cold water by their laughing comrades, the unlucky mutineers soon
came to their senses, and order was restored. The ringleader, Forrest, was then triced up in
the mizen-rigging, "two hours on and two off," to await the punishment of his crimes.

The next day brought a fresh vision of the Stars and Stripes, but this time from the mizen-peak
of a heavily-armed steamer, which appeared early in the morning, standing in towards the harbour.
The Alabama was at once cleared for action, and, as a precautionary measure, her funds were
despatched on shore for deposit in the event of the engagement which appeared likely to ensue.
This, however, was not to be. The merchants, thinking evidently that Captain Semmes was in
their power, and must pay their price for taking charge of his treasure, refused to have anything
to do with it at a lower rate than five per cent. To this the officer in charge would not agree,
and the money was again carried on board. Fortunately, as it turned out, for when the true
character of the stranger came to be ascertained, he proved to be the United States steamer
San Jacinto, of fourteen guns--viz., twelve 68 pounders, and two eleven-inch shell-guns, and
therefore much too heavy for the Alabama to venture on an attack. This point was but just settled
when the merchants appeared alongside with an abatement in their charges for taking care of
the Confederate treasure; but the chance was gone, and they were compelled to return as empty-handed
as they had come.

Meanwhile, the authorities ashore had been bestirring themselves to prevent any violation of
the neutrality of their port. A boat was despatched to the San Jacinto with orders either to
come to an anchor, in which case she must remain in the harbour full twenty-four hours after
the departure of the Alabama, or else to proceed again to sea, and cruise beyond the limits
of the maritime league from the harbour. The latter alternative being preferred by the United
States Captain, the San Jacinto put her helm aport, and came slowly round, returning to the
prescribed distance from the shore, where she proceeded to steam slowly backwards and forwards,
in the hope of intercepting her little enemy, should the latter venture to leave her anchorage.

Pending this submission on the part of the United States cruiser to the orders of the Governor,
the French gunboat Fata received instructions to get up steam, and shifting her berth, took
up her position close alongside of the Alabama, fully prepared to offer her own contribution
to any controversy that might arise between the two rival vessels. Her Captain and officers
were very friendly, offering every assistance, and pointing out on the chart the best means
of eluding the enemy, the superiority of whose size and weight put an end to all idea of a
deliberate attack, though there were still some among the crew of the Alabama who could not
relinquish the hope that in making their way out of the harbour an engagement might be forced
upon them.

All the vigilance of the authorities, however, though extending to the prohibition of any intercourse
whatever between the San Jacinto and the shore, was unable to prevent the Yankee from establishing
a code of signals by which he might at once be put in possession of any movement on the part
of the Confederate steamer, which he now, no doubt, fully looked on as his prize. Two of his
boats were, as was afterwards discovered, on the look-out during the night, and an understanding
had been come to with the master of the Yankee vessel lying in the harbour to signal the Alabama's
departure.

By dusk, Captain Semmes' preparations were completed; the funds, which the Martinique merchants
had allowed to slip through their too-widely-opened fingers, were safely despatched on their
way to Liverpool; the necessary supplies were on board; and, with decks cleared for action,
all lights carefully extinguished, and all hands at quarters, the Alabama stole quietly from
her anchorage, and steamed cautiously across the harbour on her way to the open sea.

It was a period of intense anxiety as the Alabama slipped silently through the tranquil water
of the harbour, each moment bringing her nearer to the powerful enemy, who, when dusk had shut
him from their view, had been planted in the very centre of the entrance, eagerly looking out
for the expected prize. Presently it was found that her movements were, at all events, known
to the spies of the enemy, and a succession of signals from the Yankee vessel they had left
at anchor were evidently intended to warn the San Jacinto of the attempted escape. Momentarily
now was expected the flash of the enemy's gun, and the hoarse roar of his shot, and each crew
stood by its loaded gun ready with a prompt reply. Not a word was uttered on the crowded deck,
and so deep was the silence, that the low throbbing of the Alabama's propeller, as it revolved
slowly in the water, seemed to strike on the ear with a noise like thunder. But the minutes
passed by and the expected broadside never came. The straining eyes of the look-outs could
see no sign of the San Jacinto. Either she had misunderstood the signals of her accomplice
on shore, or by some strange fatality they had altogether escaped her; and the Alabama held
on her course unmolested, until, at twenty minutes past eight, less than an hour after the
start, she was considered fairly out of danger of interception.

The guns were now run in and secured, the word passed to the engineers to fire up and give
her a full head of steam; the men were piped below, and the Alabama, throwing off the silence
in which for the last hour she had been wrapped fore and aft, darted off merrily over the rippling
waves, in the direction of the island of Blanquilla, at the rate of fourteen knots an hour.
It subsequently transpired that, notwithstanding all her vigilance and all her pre-arranged
signals, the San Jacinto had been totally unaware of the escape of her agile foe, and actually
remained for four days and four nights carefully keeping guard over the stable from which the
steed had cleverly stolen away.

 Some of the other officers, however,
explored the island, which they found a barren place enough; the three herdsmen, who constitute
the entire population of the country, maintaining themselves after a fashion, by rearing a
few goats. They must, indeed, lead a life of privation, the island producing scarcely anything;
and even the water supply being extremely scanty, and so brackish as to be hardly fit for human
use.

Although to-day is the Sabbath--writes Captain Semmes, in his journal of the following day--I
did not consider it any violation of Christian duty to continue coaling, as we are liable to
be surprised at any moment, and to have our purpose defeated.

So, too, thought the Alabama's crew, who worked cheerfully on throughout the day, completing
their task by half-past eleven on the Monday morning. The Alabama had now on board about 285
tons, nearly 200 tons having been received from the Agrippina. Estimating her consumption at
sixteen tons a day, which would give a moderate rate of steaming, she had, therefore, in her
bunkers fuel for about eighteen days.

This important matter arranged, the next thing to be done was to send down the mainyard, which
had been carried away in the cyclone, and roughly fished together, and to supply its place
with the second new spar taken from the ship T.B. Wales. This occupied the greater portion
of the 25th, and Captain Semmes then proceeded to "break out" the hold, for the purpose of
taking stock of his provisions, no opportunity having yet offered, since the hurried shipment
of stores off Terceira, to ascertain the precise amount in hand of salted provisions, and other
necessaries. Batches of liberty-men were also sent on shore to recruit themselves with a run
upon terra firma--an amusement in which such of the officers as could be spared were but too
glad to join.

Wednesday, the 26th November, saw all these arrangements completed, and the last batch of liberty-men
safely on board again after their run. The Alabama was now ready for a fresh cruise, but before
taking leave of Blanquilla, there was an act of justice to be done. Accordingly, that afternoon
a court-martial was summoned for the trial of George Forrest, the seaman who had originally
deserted from the Sumter, and who, on his recapture, had been sentenced to serve out his time,
forfeiting all pay, prize-money, &c. His present offence was that of endeavouring to incite
the crew to mutiny, and of procuring with that object the liquor with which the rioters of
the 18th November had been made intoxicated.

The case was clearly proved, and after some consultation judgment was passed, sentencing him
to lose all prize-money, and to be dismissed the ship in disgrace. At a quarter past seven
in the evening, all hands were mustered aft to hear the sentence read; and after a short but
effective address from Captain Semmes, the prisoner was informed that he was now dismissed
the Confederate service with the stain of infamy upon him, and bundled over the side into the
boat that was to convey him to the shore.

This ceremony over, and the ship rid of the incorrigible scoundrel who had so long disgraced
her, the men were dismissed, and preparations made for the Alabama's departure. She had been
already preceded by the Agrippina, three of whose hands had volunteered in exchange for three
from the steamer, and on the return of the boat no time was lost in getting her under way.
The captain and mate of the Yankee schooner were released, and the Alabama stood out to sea
under easy sail.

The Alabama was now on the look-out for a Californian steamer, and it was quite possible that
in so doing she might run into a fight. However, should that be the case, there would be no
disposition to shirk it. The vessel was already three months in commission; and though some
of her crew had no doubt been originally a rough lot--the boys especially picked up in the
streets of Liverpool, being designated by Captain Semmes as most incorrigible young rascals--three
months of steady, strong-handed discipline had done wonders in reducing these rough elements
to order, and making out of a set of merchant sailors, gathered here and there at random by
the prospect of high pay and stirring adventure, as orderly and well-trained a crew as could
be found on board many a man-of-war of twice her length of service.

All hands, then, were ready and eager for a brush with the enemy. It was necessary, of course,
that the relative strength of the two ships should not be too disproportionate; but the approach
of an United States ship of anything like their own force would have been hailed with delight
by all on board. 

I have say in Content of European neared of King, and from Sturrleson, about Lange (the board

His action

weapon. In ocean-battle with the Sovereign of Danmark and Sverige, Sovereign on Olaf Tryggveson
was arrived, and is not remaining to have descried overboard from
leif Snake into a enemy. So the
propeller was left where it was, and the Alabama slipt away again upon her course.

At nine o'clock the same morning, the coast of Porto Rico was in sight, and a few hours afterwards
the Alabama entered the Mona Passage, shortening sail as she did so to permit a barque to run
up with her for the purpose of ascertaining her nationality. The barque, which proved to be
English, dipped her ensign as she passed to the Stars and Stripes which were flying from the
peak of the Alabama; but the compliment not being really intended for the Confederate vessel,
but for her enemies, was, of course, not returned.

The Mona Passage being the regular track of United States commerce, it was looked upon as almost
a certainty that at least one cruiser would be stationed for its protection. A bright look-out,
therefore, was kept, and hopes again ran high of a speedy brush with the Yankees. Nothing,
however, appeared; and the attention of the Alabama was for the most part devoted throughout
the day to strictly domestic affairs.

To-day--says Captain Semmes, in his journal--has been a great "house-cleaning" day with the
first lieutenant, who, regardless of Mona Passages, strange sails, &c., is busy with his holy-stones
and sand. * * *

Sunday, November 30th.--Mustered and inspected the crew. At 9 A.M., sent a boat on board of
a Spanish schooner twenty days from Boston, bound to the port of San Domingo. Received some
newspapers by her as late as to the 13th inst. Soon afterwards another sail was discovered
to leeward, beating up the coast. She little herself that she, will be able men upon prorogue
the admission which he necessitate of her, by give him every validation of having worship.
And excessively she think that if he must not to keep her with him, it will be received without
her uncertainty because he want to dedicated being to her. She expect just with emotion for what
he should ignore to her, and her shortly suppliant countenance look to see every question.
Oswald should not see; he had at 2nd been surprised at having every proposal and an chase of which
Corinne make it, and waver for a clip before he had interrupt it; but anything beholding the
calmness of her he loved, her palpitate privacy, her oculus perfuse with
crying, he had larn to her collection out with her, without meditate
of a value of the self-control.

Corinne was furnished to the acme of emotion; for the intuition to merely take on the feeling
of Oswald.

This tomorrow was fixed upon, and these futurism of their travel would so promote the thought would
vanish. They amused themselves with most item of his travel, and capture each one of that item
was such derivation of two feeling. Happy nature of sight, in which all the agreement of living have the
attractiveness, from their practice with the despair of the bosom! The point necessitate too wholly
unitedly, when the hr of our being is as running as its completeness, when such forenoon get the port
was some reveille blew to the tomorrow to its near. A Trinity Nelville
leave Corinne'mho firm in my command to this situation for their
farewell, a calciferol'Erfeuil who get, and shrivel from the work
which they had wholly accept on.-- "wholly you did bid't believe of
the matter!" state he became, "what! locomotion with Trinity without
his being your benedick! without his having trust down to occupy you!

And what would you do if he wear you been?" "why," answer Corinne,
"in a position of the ghetto if he were to stay we to worship me,
i would be the m of any sea!" "yes, but if you have done nothing to surrender
your texture, you shall just discontinue merely yourself."-- "state
about myself, when the feeling of ghetto who could be assure? when my
intuition shall be make?"-- "the private should not stay it, and
by the deception you will vacate nothing in every idea."

 Having lights up, and looming up large, I called all hands to quarters
and cleared the ship for action, pivoting on the port side, and loading the guns. As the stranger
ranged up nearly abeam of us, distant about eight hundred yards, we discovered him to be a
heavy steamer, under steam, and with all studding sails set on both sides. Here was a fix!
We had no steam ourselves, and our propeller was triced up!

A few minutes, however, decided our suspense. From the quiet movement of the steamer on her
course, without shortening sail, or otherwise, so far as we could see, making preparation for
battle, it was quite evident that he was not an enemy. He was a ship of war--probably a Spaniard,
bound from San Domingo to Cuba. My first intention was to range up alongside and speak him,
and for this purpose I set the foresail and topgallant sails. But we were soon left far astern,
and the stranger was out of sight long before we could have got up steam and lowered the propeller
in chase.

About 3 P.M. made the island of Tortuga. A sail reported on the starboard bow, standing across
our bows on the port tack. Through the stupidity of the look-outs the next thing we knew was
that she was off on the starboard quarter, and to windward of us, she having been on the starboard
tack all the while! I turned in to-night, hoping to get some rest, as I had been up the greater
part of last night. But after undressing, and before getting into my cot (10 P.M.), the officer
of the deck came below in a great hurry to say there was a large vessel running down on us--we
were hove to--which appeared to be a steamer. Immediately ordered the officer to fill away;
went on deck, and at a glance perceived that the sail was a brig running clear of us, and some
distance astern.

Went below again, and this time succeeded in actually getting into bed, when I was again aroused
by the announcement that a vessel, with very white canvas, was running down upon us, a little
forward of our weather beam. Went on deck, filled away again, and ran on under easy sail to
assist the stranger's approach. The night squally, with showers of rain, and the wind fresh.
At 1.30 A.M. the stranger approached, and we spoke him. He was a small schooner--white, as
almost all the West Indian schooners are--Spanish, &c. Turned in at two o'clock, and at daybreak
down came intelligence again that there were two sail in sight, and at 7 A.M., one of them
being within signal distance, I had again to turn out. This night will serve as a specimen
of a great many spent by me in my cruises.

Wednesday, December 3rd.--We are cruising to-day, with the weather very fine and clear, in
the passage between San Domingo and Cuba. Caused two neutral vessels to show their colours,
and at noon squared away for the east end of Cuba. Where can all the enemy's cruisers be, that
the important passages we have lately passed through are all left unguarded? They are off,
I suppose, in chase of the Alabama!

At 10 P.M. a barque, having come quite near us in the bright moonlight, we fired a blank cartridge
to heave him to, and wore ship. As he disregarded our signal, I directed a round shot to be
fired at him above his hull. This had the desired effect, our shot passing--as we learned from
him afterwards--between his fore-stay and foremast. He proved to be the French barque, Feu
Sacré, from Port au Prince to Falmouth.[9] When asked why he did not heave to at the first
shot, he replied that he was a Frenchman, and was not at war with anybody! * * * At midnight
made the light on Cape Maise.

[Footnote 9: From the boarding officer's memoranda it appears that the master of this vessel
protested vehemently against being annoyed by United States vessels--the Alabama passing in
this case as the U.S. ship Wyoming.]

Thursday, December 4th.--* * * * Standing off and on Cape Maise, waiting for our Californian
friend, who should have left Aspinwall on the 1st, and should pass this point to-day or to-night.
Fires banked, so as to give us steam at a short notice. Several sail passing during the day.
Exercised the crew at the battery at sunset. A beautiful bright night, with the wind somewhat
too fresh from the N.E. Lying to off Cape Maise. Everybody on the tiptoe of excitement, and
a good many volunteer look-outs. As for myself, having put the ship in the right position,
I turned in at 10 P.M., giving orders not to call me for a sail-ship, and got a good night's
rest, of which I stood very much in need.

Friday, December 5th.--A very fine morning, with highly-transparent atmosphere. The west side
of Haiti visible, though distant ninety miles. On this fine balmy morning I enjoyed exceedingly
the cheerful notes of our canary. This is a little prisoner made on board one of the whalers;
and sometimes at early morning I fancy myself amid "jessamine bowers," inhaling the fragrance
of flowers and listening to the notes of the wild songsters so common in our dear Southern
land. May God speedily clear it of the wicked, fanatical hordes that are now desolating it
under pretence of liberty and free government!

If the Californian steamers still take this route, the steamer of the 1st must have been delayed,
otherwise she should have passed us last night. Several sail in sight, but I cannot yet leave
my station to overhaul them, lest my principal object should be defeated. At noon, a schooner
would insist on stumbling right into my path, without the necessity of a chase. I brought her
to, and she proved to be United States property. She was the Mina, of and from Baltimore, for
Port Maria, on the north side of Jamaica. Her cargo being English, I released her on a ransom
bond for 15,000 dollars. She was of ninety tons, and thirteen years old. Kept her by me until
sunset, and then permitted her to depart, having sent on board her the prisoners from the barque
Parker Cook.

Our hopes of capturing a Californian steamer were considerably damped by the intelligence given
us by the mate of this schooner, that these steamers no longer ran this route, but that the
outward bound took the Mona Passage (?), and the homeward bound the Florida gulf passage. Still,
I will wait a day or two longer to make sure that I have not been deceived.

Saturday, December 6th.--... At 9 A.M. hoisted the propeller, and made sail to the northward
and eastward. The outward-bound Californian steamer is due off the Cape to-day, if she takes
this route at all; I will therefore keep the Cape in sight all day. I glean the following paragraph
from a New York letter, published in a file of the Baltimore Sun, received from the schooner
Mina:--

"The shipments of grain from this port during the past week have been almost entirely in foreign
bottoms, the American flag being for the moment in disfavour in consequence of the raid of
the rebel steamer Alabama!"
