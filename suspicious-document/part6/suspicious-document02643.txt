Chapter I.

The Will

In a large and handsomely-furnished room of a somewhat old-fashioned house, situated in a rural
district in the south of Scotland, was assembled, one day in the early summer of 185-, a small
group in deep mourning.

Mr. Hogarth, of Cross Hall, had been taken suddenly ill a few days previously, and had never
recovered consciousness so far as to be able to speak, though he had apparently known those
who were about him, and especially the two orphan nieces whom he had brought up as his daughters.
He had no other near relations whom any one knew of, and had never been known to regret that
the name of Hogarth, of Cross Hall, was likely to become extinct. He had the reputation of
being the most eccentric man in the country, and was thought to be the most inconsistent.

With the highest opinion possible of women, and the greatest pleasure in their society, he
had never married; and with the greatest affection for his nieces, and the greatest theoretical
confidence in them, he had hedged them about with countless laws and restrictions, and had
educated them in a way quite different from the training of young ladies of their rank and
prospects. He had succeeded two childless elder brothers in the possession of the estate; and
Jane and Alice Melville were the only children of his only sister, who had been dead for fifteen
years.

The funeral had just taken place, and the two girls had been summoned into the drawing-room
to hear the will read by Mr. MacFarlane, the Edinburgh lawyer, who had drawn it out. They found
in the room Mr. Baird, their uncle's medical attendant, and a stranger whom they had never
seen before--a tall, grave-looking man of about thirty-four, whose mourning was new, and who
showed a deep interest in what was going on.

Both the man of law and the man of medicine looked nervous and embarrassed, and delayed proceeding
to business as long as they possibly could; fumbling with knots of red tape; opening the closed
curtains to admit a little more light, and then closing them again, as if the light was too
strong; so that the sisters had time to look at the stranger, and to wonder who he was and
what his business could be there. He also seemed to be taking notes of the young ladies in
a quiet, timid manner.

At last the will was opened, and after the usual preamble, the lawyer's voice seemed to break
a little. He cleared his throat, and continued in a lower tone----

"As I have come to the conclusion that the minds of men and women are radically the same, and
as I believe that if the latter are trained in the same way as the former they will be equally
capable of making their own way in the world, I have acted upon this principle in the education
of my two beloved nieces, Jane and Alice Melville, the only surviving children of my sister
Mary Hogarth; and as I foresee that if I were to leave them wealthy heiresses my purpose would
be completely thwarted, by Jane losing her independent character, and Alice sinking into a
confirmed invalid, and by both being to a dead certainty picked up by needy spendthrifts, who
will waste their fortunes and break their hearts, as their father, George Melville, served
my poor foolish sister, I hereby convey and dispose all my property, whatsoever and wheresoever,
heritable and moveable, to Francis Ormistown, otherwise Hogarth, at present head clerk in the
Bank of Scotland, who is my son by a private irregular marriage contracted with Elizabeth Ormistown,
on the ninth day of July, 18--, and who is my heir-at-law, though he would find it difficult
to prove his claim, as he knows nothing of the relation between us, and as the only party besides
myself cognizant of the marriage dares not come forward to prove it, but whose progress I have
watched with interest, who has made an honourable position for himself, without any assistance
from me beyond a good education, who has served faithfully, and who is likely to rule uprightly,
who has raised himself from nameless poverty, and whom, therefore, I judge to be worthy of
wealth and honour: Provided always, that he shall pay to Jane and Alice Melville, my beloved
nieces aforesaid, the sum of twelve pounds a year each, in quarterly payments in advance, for
three years following my decease, when such payments shall cease, as by that time I believe
they will be independent in circumstances: Provided also that he shall give to the said Jane
and Alice Melville, the furniture and personal effects belonging to them, as mentioned more
particularly in the schedule marked A, appended to this instrument; and that he shall give
to the said Jane and Alice Melville no further assistance either in money or in money's worth,
directly or indirectly, whatsoever: Also providing that the said Francis Ormistown, otherwise
Hogarth, shall not marry either of his cousins; the marriage of such near relations being mischievous
and improper.

"In case of any of these provisions being disregarded by the said Francis Ormistown, otherwise
Hogarth, all my heritable and moveable property shall be divided among certain benevolent institutions,
in the order and manner set forth in the schedule marked with the letter B.

"All these provisions I have made, as being the best for my surviving relatives; and I believe
they will eventually acknowledge them to be such."

It would be hard to say which of the three parties interested, felt most astonishment at this
extraordinary will. Jane Melville stood rigid and silent, with her face flushed and her eyes
filled with tears, which she would not let fall. Alice's face lost all colour, and she seemed
ready to faint. But the greatest excitement was shown by the fortunate legatee. He shook from
head to foot, steadying himself on the table--looked from the two girls to the two gentlemen
with bewildered eyes--and said at last with difficulty, in a low, soft, tremulous voice----

"Was Mr. Hogarth in his senses when he made this will?"

"A little excited, but indisputably in full possession of his senses, strange as the will appears,"
said Mr. MacFarlane, the lawyer; "and Mr. Baird will corroborate my opinion."

Mr. Baird bowed his head affirmatively. "Quite true--his head was quite clear at the time.
The will was made six weeks ago, and you, Miss Melville, know how well he was then. Very grieved,
indeed--most inconceivable conduct--cruel--inconsiderate. I feel deeply for your disappointment.
Try not to give way, Miss Alice--or perhaps you had better give way, it may relieve you. Mr.
MacFarlane tells me that he remonstrated with Mr. Hogarth. Most painful duty--must obey instructions,
of course. Your uncle seemed like adamant. I pity you with all my heart."

"And so do I, with all my heart," said Mr. MacFarlane.

"And does no one pity me?" said the low voice of the heir to all; but it was unheeded, for
Alice had fainted. Her sister and Mr. Baird laid her on the sofa, and applied the usual restoratives.

Mr. MacFarlane began to speak in an undertone, to the new master, of the extent and value of
the property he had thus suddenly come into possession of, and congratulated him rather stiffly
on the turn of fortune that had raised him from a life of labour and comparative poverty to
ease and affluence; but his embarrassment was nothing compared to that of the man whom he addressed.
Francis Hogarth looked round the spacious room, and out of the window to the pleasant shrubbery
and smooth-shaven lawn, and shuddered when he thought of the two young cousins, brought up
apparently in the lap of luxury, who were to be turned out upon the world with 12 pounds a-year
for three years. The elder sister seemed to have a vigorous and robust constitution, but the
younger looked delicate. He saw, in his mind's eye, two governesses, dragging out a weary and
monotonous existence, far from each other, while he, possessed of superabundance, was debarred
from helping them.

He advanced timidly to the sofa. Alice, who had recovered consciousness, covered her face with
both her hands, and sobbed aloud. Jane turned towards him a glance, not of reproach, but of
pity. He felt it, and took her hand.

"Believe me, Miss Melville, no one can regret this extraordinary will as I do. I will overturn
it, if I possibly can."

"You cannot," said Jane; "it is quite in keeping with all my uncle's ideas--quite consistent
with all he has told us over and over again. He had many strange notions, but he was generally
in the right, and it MAY prove to be so now." The sigh that accompanied these words told how
faint her hopes were.

"Thirty pounds a year to begin with," said Jane, half aloud; "250 pounds after seventeen years'
work. Very sweet--all one's own earning. I am not afraid, only let Elsie keep up heart."

"I cannot," said Elsie; "I'll be dead long before seventeen years are over."

"I will take good care of you," said Jane.

"How are you to take good care either of yourself or of me if we are starving?" said Elsie,
with a fresh burst of tears.

"We will do our best. So you are going, Mr. Hogarth. Write to me if you can hear of anything
for me. I will be much obliged to you. Good-bye."

Jane shook hands with her cousin kindly, and soon after Mr. MacFarlane, and Mr. Baird also,
withdrew, leaving the sisters alone. Elsie wept till she was completely exhausted, while her
sister sat at the table with pen and ink and paper before her, but writing nothing.

After a while Elsie started up from the sofa. "Jane," said she, "if we were to marry, it would
put an end to all this perplexity. It was strange that uncle put in the clause forbidding us
to marry that man. Neither of us would demean ourselves so much, but uncle disliked the marriage
of near relatives. How strange that so little is said about the mother. I could not look at
him, but you did. Is he like his father? My uncle was a very handsome man; I fancy this man
is plain."

"I see little or no likeness to my uncle, but he is by no means plain-looking."

"Will he get into society? Do they consider such people legitimate?"

"The marriage was irregular, but legal," said Jane. "I see now the cause my uncle had to dislike
the Scotch marriage law. He must have been made very miserable from some unguarded words spoken
or written; but this does not prevent his son taking the position of a legitimate heir. He
is quiet and unassuming, and will take a very good place in society."

"It was well," said Elsie, with a faint laugh, "that this clause was inserted, for you seem
to be in some danger."

"Not at all; but we were thrown together in very extraordinary circumstances, and I could not
help feeling for his position as he felt for ours. Nor could I help asking for advice from
him. I agree with my uncle about cousins. He was right there, as he always used to be. At least,
he brought me up to think like him, and I can scarcely believe that what he has now done is wrong."

"But, Jane, setting this cousin out of the way, what do you think of William Dalzell?"

"I was just thinking of him when you spoke," said Jane, resolutely.

"Uncle must have had him in his mind when he mentioned fortune-hunters in his will, for he
never seemed to like him coming here so often; and just six weeks ago I had been going out
riding with him every day. You said you were not well, and would not accompany us. I suppose
I was giving him what people consider a great deal of encouragement. If my uncle had said plainly
that he disapproved of the intimacy, I wonder if I would have given it up? Perhaps not--one
does not like to be dictated to. It appeared to myself so strange that he should prefer me
to you. And now I recollect that my uncle must have paid his last visit to Edinburgh just before
he made his will; and there he would see this young man filling his place in the world so well,
while I was behaving so foolishly. The contrast must have struck him, and he certainly has
put an end to everything between Mr. Dalzell and myself."

"Oh, Jane, he is no fortune-hunter; this will make no change. If you marry him you must take
me home with you, and tell him it is what I deserve for standing his friend so well."

"My dearest Elsie, you have talked a great deal about Mr. Dalzell, and I have rather foolishly
listened to it, but that must be stopped now. I know he is poor; he thought to better himself
by a wealthy marriage; and perhaps if I had been left now with 20,000 pounds, with nothing
to do and nothing to think of, his agreeable qualities----"

"Well, you own he has agreeable qualities."

"Yes; I have always owned it--they might have induced me to marry him; and you, as the possessor
of other 20,000 pounds, would have been a most welcome inmate of our house until you chose
for yourself your own home. But now, Elsie, I know William Dalzell is not the man to encumber
himself with a penniless wife and a penniless sister-in-law."

"He is not mercenary--I am sure he is not," said Elsie with animation.

"Perhaps he is not positively mercenary; but after all am I worthy of the sacrifice? Look at
me, Elsie; even your sisterly partiality cannot make a beauty of me. My turn of mind is not
suited to his; I have always felt that; and, above all, I am not very fond of him."

"Not very!"

"No; I have liked him a good deal; but now in this crisis, when we have to begin life in earnest--when
I am puzzling myself how to find food and clothing and shelter for you and me--I feel as if
Mr. Dalzell's past attentions belonged to another world altogether, so I am putting them aside
completely."

"Ah! but Jane, only listen to me. If he were to come now, and lay himself and all that he has
at your feet, that would prove that he was no fortune-hunter, but a real true lover, as I always
believed him to be."

"He will not do it," said Jane, quietly; and she now began to make some memoranda.

"We have no ornaments, Elsie," said she, sadly.

"No; I never heard you regret the want of them before."

"I should like to have something to sell. Emilia Chalmers has 200 pounds worth of jewellery,
most of it left by her aunt. If we had so much, we might convert it into money, and might stock
a little shop."

"A shop!" said Elsie, shuddering.

"Why not? One is more independent keeping a shop than in a governess's situation, and there
my business knowledge would be of use. It is wrong and absurd to have a terror of a shop."

"I cannot help feeling a great repugnance to shopkeeping."

"Then would you rather be a governess, supposing you were capable?"

"Oh, Jane, that is such a hard life. I should be separated from you; and then one is worried
by the children, and snubbed by the parents, sneered at by servants, and ignored by visitors."

"Then dressmaking? You work beautifully."

"The late hours, and the close rooms; do you think I could stand it?"

"I am a little afraid for you," said Jane, thoughtfully. "What would you like to do?"

"Why, I have never thought of doing anything but being with you, working a little, reading
a little, going out a little, and having nobody over me but you, my own darling sister. It
stuns me to be told that I must go to work for a livelihood."

"I hope we may be able to live together as you hoped, eventually; but in the meantime we must
both put our shoulders to the wheel."

"Have we no friends who would give us a home--at least for a while, till we get accustomed
to the thought of hard work?" said Elsie.

"We have no relations, and we have made but few friends. I fear no one would come forward to
help us now that we need help so much. It is a pity that my uncle kept us so much to himself,
and that we were so fully occupied with our own home duties that we had little or no time for
society. Now we have no capital for a start, and no friends to help us on, only our talents
and our education--a small stock-in-trade, I fear."

In the course of the afternoon the man-servant, James, announced that Mr. Dalzell was below,
and that he sent his compliments and wished to know how the young ladies were.

It was not the first visit since Mr. Hogarth's death. He had paid a visit of condolence on
the following day, and had never been so affectionate or impressive in his manner to Jane as
on that occasion.

"Show Mr. Dalzell upstairs, James," said Jane; "I think I should like to see him."

The man looked somewhat intelligent, and obeyed.

"I cannot see anybody--I am not fit to be seen," said Elsie, retreating in haste from the room;
"and indeed, Jane, I wonder at you wishing to see him so soon after this dreadful news."

"He has been at the funeral, I suppose. It is very proper of him to inquire for us, and very
imperative that we should understand each other;--the sooner the better. But do not stay if
you do not like. I should prefer to see him alone."

Mr. Dalzell was shown into the darkened drawing-room, where he was some time in discovering
that Miss Melville was alone. A few of the kind commonplaces which had been so successful on
his previous visit--remarks on the loss she had sustained, on the excellent character of her
deceased uncle, and on the necessity of bearing the blow with fortitude, which her strong mind
was quite capable of--were made by Mr. Dalzell in unconsciousness that they fell very differently
on Jane's ears now. Jane asked for his mother, and heard that she was very well, and sent her
kindest regards and condolences, and hoped that the Misses Melville would be able to see her
on the following day.

"Were there many people at the funeral?" asked Jane.

"Oh yes, a great man; Mr. Hogarth was so extensively known, and so much respected."

"Were there any strangers?"

"Several--to me," said Dalzell.

"Did you observe no one in particular?"

"Yes, a gentleman from Edinburgh, said to be a PROTEGE of your uncle's, who took rather a prominent
place on account of there being no male relative surviving."

"Have you heard," said Jane, with an effort--"have you heard anything of the will?"

"Nothing whatever--did not think it proper or delicate to inquire, though I saw Mr. MacFarlane
after it had been read. It is a matter of no consequence to me how Mr. Hogarth has left his
property. My feelings will be quite the same towards----"

"Stop," said Jane; "my uncle has left his entire fortune to this stranger from Edinburgh, who
is his son by a private marriage. Elsie and I have had an education, and must make the best
we can of it."

"Miss Melville, this is incredible--quite incredible. You are merely trying me. Mr. Hogarth
was incapable of such madness and injustice. It is not treating me well to play upon me in
this way."

"In proof of what I say, here is a certified copy of the will--the final will--executed six
weeks ago, when, as you know, my uncle was perfectly well both in body and mind. It is incontestable."

The bewildered young man tried to read the paper put into his hand, but he could not follow
the written words. Jane's sad face and her manner convinced him, however, that she was telling
him the truth.

"Now," said Jane kindly, "you have talked a great deal of nonsense to me when my position was
very different; but I am quite aware that things are altogether changed. I will not feel at
all hurt or angry about it. We part perfectly good friends. But you cannot afford to marry
a wife without money, and I should be sorry to be a burden to any man."

William Dalzell looked at the girl he had fancied himself in love with for the last few months,
and felt that his love had not been of a very deep or absorbing character. If the two girls
had been equal favourites of their uncle's, his choice would have fallen on Elsie, who was
prettier, more elegant, more yielding, and, as he thought, more affectionate. Her impulsive
and confiding manner, her little enthusiasms, her blunders, were to him more charming than
Jane's steady good sense and calm temper. Jane never wanted advice or assistance; she was too
independent in mind, and too robust in body, to care much about little attentions, though she
had become accustomed to his in the course of time, and as there was no other person to compare
him with, had allowed herself to think a good deal of him. Mr. Hogarth had always shown so
marked a preference for Jane, and had so often expressed displeasure and impatience at Elsie's
deficiencies; his property, not being entailed, was entirely at his own disposal, so that it
was probable that Jane would be left the larger share of it, while if he made love to Alice
it was quite possible that she would be disinherited altogether, for he knew that he was not
a favourite with the old gentleman. He did not think that anything could shake Mr. Hogarth's
confidence in Jane, and he had been very careful in feeling his ground sure before he made
a formal proposal. He had tried to persuade himself that Jane's face was charming, though not
regularly handsome; so it was to some people, but he had not eyes to see the charm. Her figure
was undeniably fine, her temper good, her principles to be depended on. Her education had been
peculiar, and singularly secular--his mother had felt a little shocked at her want of religion--but
then Mr. Hogarth was very odd, and when she was married she would see things differently; and
on the whole Mrs. Dalzell felt that her handsome son had chosen with great prudence and good
sense in fixing his affections upon the elder and the favorite niece. His small property was
heavily encumbered, and such a marriage would make him hold up his head again in the country.
Mrs. Dalzell's attentions to Jane had been nearly as assiduous as her son's, and to the motherless
girl they were quite as welcome; and she had shown so much affection for Alice, too, that both
sisters had been very much captivated with her.

William Dalzell felt Jane's kindly-meant speech as a sort of reproach. He would have preferred
to make a speech himself, and to have seen her more agitated. Though he had never thought himself
very much in love, he believed he had inspired a strong love, and that it would be very hard
for Jane to give him up. But things were completely taken out of his hands; she did not even
now, in the first pain of parting, dream of breaking her heart. She was his superior, painfully
his superior, and he did not like it.

"You are quite right, Miss Melville," said he; "what you say is quite true. I am involved and
embarrassed, and could not offer you anything worth having."

"And I will make my own way in the world," said Jane; "and, William Dalzell, do not be hurt
if I give you one friendly piece of advice on parting--try to make your own way in the world
too. Shake yourself clear of your own embarrassments by your own industry--a far better way
than by marrying a rich wife."

She looked very kindly at the young man as she spoke, but he did not take the advice in the
friendly spirit in which it was given. He answered rather shortly, that he dared to say he
would do as well as other people, and then began to ask what she knew about the heir, if she
had ever seen him before, or heard Mr. Hogarth speak of him. She answered----

"No, never; but I cannot answer questions. I cannot converse rationally any longer. You had
better go away, Mr. Dalzell, and let me have a little rest, for I am rather weary."

The young gentleman stumbled down stairs, and rode home ruminating over the downfall of all
his cherished expectations; while Jane said to herself, "It is over, and it is better so. He
really is a smaller character than I thought he was."

Chapter II.

Disappointment and Hope; Prose and Poetry

When Jane Melville told her cousin that her uncle had been always kind and always reasonable,
she expressed her own opinion, for she had loved and honoured him so much that she felt no
hardship in doing everything he wished; but no one else in the house or in the neighbourhood
would have endorsed that opinion. When the rumour spread far and wide that he had disinherited
his nieces, in the expectation that the education he had given them would enable them to provide
handsomely for themselves, the servants and workpeople about shook their heads, and said it
was "aye weel kenned that the auld laird had a bee in his bonnet;" while the class with whom
Mr. Hogarth associated on more equal terms declared; that this last eccentricity of affection
(for it was all done out of pure love), surpassed all his other oddities with regard to the
girls, which had long been the talk of the whole country.

They had, as Jane sadly confessed, made but few friends. Their uncle's reasonable prejudices
extended to morning visits, which he called a frivolous waste of time; and he had a similar
dislike to evening parties; not on account of a puritanic disapproval of dancing, or of young
people of different sexes meeting and having opportunities of getting acquainted with each
other, but the hours were so irrational, and the conventional dress so unbecoming and dangerous
to health, that he had prohibited Jane and Elsie from accepting the invitations that were showered
on them when they had given up lessons and were supposed to be ready to come out. If people
would meet at six, and break up before twelve, and wear dresses fashioned like their ordinary
attire, Mr. Hogarth saw no objection to evening parties. He had invited the neighbours to such
a party, and mentioned in his note of invitation the conditions on which it was to be attended.
A good many had accepted, partly from curiosity, and partly from a wish to be friendly; but,
in spite of really good arrangements and an excellent supper, the party was not such a success
as to be repeated often by Mr. Hogarth, and was never imitated by any of his guests.

The Misses Melville danced well, walked well, and rode admirably; they spent several hours
every day in the open air; had learnt to swim, and to shoot both with bow and arrow and with
rifle. Their physical education had been excellent, and had probably saved Elsie's life, for
she was extremely delicate when young, but had gained strength as she grew up.

Their book education had been chiefly conducted by an old gentleman, who had lived for eight
years in their house as tutor, and they had spent several winters in Edinburgh, to attend classes
and lectures. No money, no care, and no time had been spared on their education, so that it
was rather a pity that, in the eyes of the world, it was so unsatisfactory when completed.
Both had gone through the same routine; for Mr. Hogarth seemed to think that education made
characters, instead of merely drawing out what there is in the original material, and he was
disappointed that the uniformity of the training had not produced two characters more similar
than those of Jane and Elsie. Jane's tendencies were to the practical and the positive; and
she gladly availed herself of her uncle's whim to educate her like a man of business, regretting
none of the accomplishments and showy acquirements which are too apt to be considered the principal
part of female education. Expecting that she would be left in possession of considerable property,
and virtually the guardian of her younger sister, she saw a fitness and propriety in her being
taught the management of money, the science of agriculture, the care of an establishment, and
the accurate keeping of accounts.

Elsie would have preferred another training, but it was not given to her; and though she made
but a lame attempt to follow Jane's footsteps, and acquired only a superficial knowledge of
what her sister was the perfect mistress of, her uncle believed that, bad as she was, she would
have been much worse if she had not been forced into rational studies. Though she was not a
marvel of solidity, she still had as good a knowledge of accounts, general information, history,
and science, as is possessed by many boys who get on very well in business or in professions,
when once set fairly to work.

Mr. Hogarth had no great opinion of the value of teaching languages, and thought that a knowledge
of things was of far more importance than a knowledge of the names of things. The girls had
learned, however, a good deal of Latin and Greek from Mr. Wilson, their tutor, who thought
it a pity that Jane's fine abilities should not have a classical education; and he had induced
Mr. Hogarth to agree to it by the argument that these languages are invaluable for the ready
and correct understanding of all scientific terms. French and Italian the girls themselves
were anxious to learn; and as they had been promised a continental tour some fine summer, their
uncle thought they might be useful acquirements then, so they had lessons from the best masters
in Edinburgh, and profited by them. And here for the first time Elsie's progress had been far
greater than Jane's. Mr. Hogarth had himself spent a good deal of time in his youth in France;
but he had a higher opinion of French society than of French literature, and he thought that
from the lips of brilliant Parisian women they would learn more of the spirit of the language
and of the people than from the books they studied in classes or read at home.

Elsie had a natural taste for music, and a remarkably sweet voice in speaking, which, if it
had been cultivated, would have made her an excellent singer; but her uncle was sure that to
indulge her with a musical education would only weaken her mind. Mr. Hogarth had seen no good
come of music. A taste for singing and a fine voice had been the ruin of thousands--they had
been most mischievous to Elsie's own father, and they had been the chief fascinations which
had won upon his dear sister Mary. She and George Melville had sung duets together, and from
that had been led to try a duet through life; and a very sad and inharmonious life they had
made of it.

So poor Elsie's natural tastes were discouraged and thwarted; and after the positive lessons
were over, and her education was said to be finished, she felt vacuity and ennui when Jane
rejoiced in full employment. The housekeeping was ostensibly taken by the sisters in alternate
weeks; but though Jane relinquished the keys for the stated period, she never relinquished
the superintendence. She remembered what Elsie forgot; she looked forward where Elsie would
have scrambled in the best way she could through the passing hour, and constantly thinking
for her and remedying her blunders. Elsie was apt to forget that any responsibility rested
on herself.

Nothing in their singular training was considered odder than that, while they were educated
in a more masculine manner than most boys, they were obliged at the same time to make a greater
proportion of their own clothes than any girls of their own rank or circumstances, and that
they had been carefully and systematically taught to make them in the best manner possible.
The only instructions which they had received from one of their own sex had been given to them
by an excellent plain needlewoman, a first-class dressmaker, and a fashionable milliner; and
in the last two branches Elsie's taste had made her excel her sister even more than in French
and Italian.

At the time of their uncle's death, Jane was twenty-three years old, and Elsie two years younger.
They had but very recently given up regular study, for their uncle thought girls were far too
soon "finished", as it is called, and turned out in a very incomplete state of mental and moral
development. He would not let them think themselves educated till they had seen more of the
world than could be done in Edinburgh, which was a city he had rather a contempt for, as a
mere provincial capital, too superstitious and narrow-minded for his taste. Paris and London
were the schools for men, and therefore, according to his notions, for women also; but when
the time arrived for the tour on the Continent and the winter in London, which had been promised
to the girls, he felt his health had given way, though he had no positive illness, and delayed
leaving home till the following year, when he hoped to be able to enjoy it, and to show all
he meant to show to the girls without fatigue or indifference. If he had been able to go with
them on the previous year, as had been arranged, he would probably have left his fortune otherwise,
for Mr. Dalzell's attentions had only been of recent date.

As the news of the will spread, every one said they really ought to call on the Melvilles,
poor things; but no one was in a hurry to perform so disagreeable a duty. Mrs. Dalzell was
so astounded by the change that was made in her son's prospects, and so embarrassed lest she
should be looked to for assistance in the present urgent necessities of the girls, that though
she had been by far the most intimate and cordial of their friends, she was not the first to
visit them. Three or four matrons had come and gone, who had made but short calls, and who
had taken refuge in commonplace inquiries as to how and when Mr. Hogarth had been first taken
ill, and at what hour he died, but had given very little sympathy, and no advice. The minister
of the parish had called, as in duty bound, on the day after the funeral, and surprised both
Jane and Elsie by a style of conversation very different from any they had ever heard from
his lips. In his previous visits to Cross Hall he had never talked of anything but the weather,
and crops, and the news of the neighbourhood. His tastes, his studies, his politics, and his
faith were so opposite to those of Mr. Hogarth that there was no safety, and likely to be no
pleasure, in conversation that left the neutral ground he took. But now, when the eccentric
and sceptical Mr. Hogarth had crowned all this sins by an act of such injustice to his nieces,
and they were in affliction from bereavement and poverty, he wished to give them spiritual
comfort, and to teach them something that he knew had been omitted in their education; but
he couched his consolation in language that seemed strangely unfamiliar to the girls he addressed,
and when he spoke of crosses to be borne, that God has made crooks in every lot that no man
may make straight--when he dwelt upon the temptations of riches, and the difficulty with which
the rich can enter the kingdom of Heaven, and hoped that his young friends would see the hand
of God in this trying dispensation, and would follow humbly His leading--Jane, who hoped to
conquer her difficulties, and did not mean to succumb to them, did not feel much comforted
or edified by the well-meant exhortation. Both girls felt pained, too, by the reflections he
cast on their late uncle, and by the warning to be prepared for sudden death, as this had been
an instance of the Master coming when no one was looking for Him, and when the loins were not
girt, nor the light burning. Both girls had loved their uncle; and even though Elsie felt that
he had been often hard to her, and that the will was not a just one, she could not bear the
idea that Mr. Herries suggested of his probable place in the future state, while Jane felt
indignant.

They had both hoped for some help and comfort from Mrs. Dalzell; but when her visit was so
long delayed, their expectations fell considerably. Jane had become so tired of the useless
kind of condolence that was offered, that she determined to ask for advice from the next person
who came, and that happened to be Mrs. Dalzell. She spoke a little more freely and kindly to
the girls than other people had done; but still she was keeping serious difficulties at arm's
length, when Jane turned rather sharply round on her with the abrupt question----

"What do you think we ought to do, Mrs. Dalzell?"

"Indeed, I cannot say, Miss Melville. This most unaccountable conduct of Mr. Hogarth's has
taken us all by surprise, so much that I can think of nothing but overturning the will. I am
sure when William told me of the extraordinary disposition of the property, I felt--I cannot
tell you how I felt. Such a shocking thing to leave all to a son whom nobody ever heard of
before, and to leave his sister's children destitute. You certainly have a claim on the heir,
for a maintenance at least. He should be made to refund a part of the spoil."

"He would if he could, but it is forbidden. There is no help in that way," said Jane. "But
employment, Mrs. Dalzell; can you suggest any employment for us?"

Mrs. Dalzell hesitated. "Mrs. Chalmers is in need of a finishing governess for Emma and Robina;
but I am afraid neither of you two young ladies would suit her, for we cannot get music-masters
here, and one must have a governess who has a good knowledge of music. If Mr. Maxwell had not
just engaged a tutor for his boys, you might have perhaps undertaken that place, Miss Melville."

"I think I might," said Jane.

"Would it not be pleasanter, if we have to take situations, to go to a distance," said Elsie.
"I do not think I could I bear you or myself to be near Cross Hall when everything is so changed."

"It would be more agreeable, I have no doubt, Miss Elsie; and I cannot help thinking that in
such a place as Edinburgh or Glasgow, where there are masters and mistresses for everything,
you could get on by having classes, or engaging as teachers at some institution. In the country
we want governesses and schoolmistresses to know everything a girl ought to learn."

"Is there nothing but teaching that we can do?" said Jane.

"Well, you know there is nothing that a gentlewoman can turn to in such circumstances as yours
but teaching, and I would be very glad indeed to see you both in nice comfortable situations.
By-the-by, Miss Elsie, I copied into my album the very sweet verses you sent me, and have brought
them back to you. Are they really your own? William says he thinks they are."

"Yes," said Elsie, "they are original."

"Well, I could not have thought it; they are extremely pretty."

"By-the-by," said Jane, "do you not know Miss Thomson, Mrs. Dalzell? My uncle always spoke
of her with respect and admiration, as an instance of the skill and success with which a woman
can conduct masculine avocations. A gentlewoman-farmer, and a thriving one. I wish we had known
her."

"Oh, yes. I do know Miss Thomson. Of course we are not exactly in the same position, we being
proprietors, while she is only a farmer; but she is a most excellent and estimable woman in
her way, though she is a bit of a character. She is now growing old, and not so active as she
has been."

"She is said to be a benevolent and a kind-hearted, as well as a clever woman," said Jane.

"Oh, yes; and well she may be liberal, for she has made money, and has not the status to keep
up that old country families must maintain."

"I wonder if she would engage me as her helper, and teach me farming. I know a good deal of
theoretical agricultural chemistry. Will you be so good as give me a letter of introduction
to her; I should feel greatly obliged to you."

Mrs. Dalzell willingly granted this small request, and felt much disposed to magnify its importance.
It would be a good thing if, without any trouble or sacrifice on her own part, she could aid
her dear young friends by bringing them into contact with a person who was more able to further
their views than herself. She was sure that Miss Thomson was the very person to apply to, for
of course she would take an interest in a young lady so unfortunately situated. It was so well
thought of on Miss Melville's part; but then Miss Melville was always so quick and sensible.
The letter of introduction was written, and then Mrs. Dalzell took leave.

Next day Elsie was languidly reading the local weekly journal, when she came upon a paragraph
which related to themselves. Mr. Hogarth's will was described and commented on. There was congratulation
for the heir and commiseration for the nieces.

"Oh, Jane," said she, "is it not dreadful to be brought before the public in this way; everybody
must be talking about us, and of course everybody has got hold of the story of William Dalzell
and you too. I am glad they did not put that in the newspapers, at any rate. Every one will
think that he gave you up, and will fancy you are so distressed about it."

"We cannot help either what people think or what they say. I do not wonder at the COURIER making
a long paragraph on the subject, for they have not had such an interesting piece of local news
since Mr. Fisher committed suicide."

"I do not like the appearance of my own name in print," said Elsie.

"It is a very pretty name, nevertheless, and would look as well on the title-page of a book
as any I know--only in a newspaper you do not like it," said Jane. "I must bid you good-bye
for a few hours now, for I am going to Miss Thomson's. I am going to ride, and will not be
very long."

Miss Thomson had just taken up the local newspaper after her morning ride over the farm, and
had read the peculiarly interesting paragraph relating to Mr. Hogarth's will, when Mrs. Dalzell's
note was put into her hands, and Miss Melville was announced.

Miss Thomson was a very fine-looking old lady, with keen, though also kind grey eyes, looking
out from rather shaggy eyebrows, and an open frank smile on her mouth. The colour of health
still bloomed on a cheek that had seen sixty summers and winters, and the elasticity of youth
had only been transformed into the dignity and repose of a green old age. Self who well the stylo

 Then on a piece of loose paper she wrote in a beautiful, clear, businesslike hand
an entry as she would put it in the book, showing that she perfectly well understood the RATIONALE
of the Dr. and the Cr. side of the ledger; and then gravely turning to Mr. Rennie, she asked
him why she would not do.

"It is not the custom, my dear young lady; I can get young men in plenty who want the place."

"I have no doubt that you can, but I want it too; and, in consideration of the prejudice against
my sex, I will take the place, and accept the salary you would give to a raw lad of sixteen,
though I am an educated and experienced woman of twenty-three. I want something that I can
rise by. I could be satisfied with the career of my cousin, without the fortune at the end.
Young women in Paris are clerks and bookkeepers; why should they not be so here?"

"France is not Scotland, or Auld Reekie Paris. We consider our customs very much better than
the French. Why, you know quite well it would never do. You would turn the heads of all my
clerks, and make them idle away their time and neglect their work. You do not see the danger
of the thing."

"No, I do not," answered Jane. "Do I look like a person who would turn any man's head? If I
do such mischief, turn me off; but I ask, in the name of common sense and common justice, a
fair trial. If I do not give satisfaction I will stand the consequences."

The serious earnestness with which Jane pleaded for so strange an employment--the matter-of-fact
way in which she stood upon her capabilities, without regarding suitabilities--impressed Francis
Hogarth while it embarrassed Mr. Rennie. It was impossible to out-reason so extraordinary an
applicant, but it was still more impossible to grant her request. Skilled as the banker was
in the delicate and difficult art of saying "No," it had to be said oftener and more distinctly
to Jane Melville than to the most pertinacious of customers, to whom discount must be refused.

"I admire your spirit, Miss Melville. If one thing cannot be accomplished you must try another.
But in an establishment like this, you see, I could not possibly take you in. A private employer
might admire your undoubted ability; but I am responsible to a Board of Directors, and they
would decidedly oppose such an innovation. Your sex, you are aware, are not noted for powers
of secrecy. I dare say it is a prejudice; but bank directors and bank customers have prejudices,
and no one likes any additional chance of having his affairs made public."

"You know you are talking nonsense, my good sir," said Jane. "It is because women have never
had any responsibilities that they have been supposed to be unworthy of trust. Where they have
been honoured with confidence they have been quite as faithful to it as any men."

"But, my dear madam," said Mr. Rennie, "what would be the consequence if all the clever women
like yourself were to thrust themselves into masculine avocations? Do you not see that the
competition would reduce the earnings of men, and then there would be fewer who could afford
to marry? The customs of society press hard upon the exceptional women who court a wider field
of usefulness, but I believe the average happiness is secured by----"

"By a system that makes forty-five educated women eager to give their life's work for 12 pounds
a-year, and fifty applying for the magnificent salary of 30 pounds for a most exhausting and
responsible situation. These are not all exceptional women, Mr. Rennie, but many of the average
women whose happiness you are so careful of. You know there are enormous numbers of single
women and widows in this country who must be supported, either by their own earnings or by
those of the other sex, for they MUST live, you know."

Mr. Rennie smiled at Jane's earnestness.

"You smile, 'ON NE VOIT PAS LA NECESSITE'," said Jane. "I dare say it would really be better
for us to die."

"I am sure nothing was further from my lips than either the language or the sentiment. I think
your case especially hard--ESPECIALLY hard."

"I thought it was, till I heard of these numerous applications; and the sad thing to me is,
that it is NOT especially hard. Some innovation must be made: have you and your directors not
the courage to begin? I am willing to endure all the ridicule that may be cast on myself."

"There are other departments of business where your unquestionable abilities and skill might
be employed and well paid for; but here, I must repeat, it is impossible--impossible--perfectly
impossible. Mr. Hogarth is going to favour us with his company this evening, and Mrs. Rennie
and my daughter Eliza would be most happy to see you. I would like to introduce my daughter
to a young lady who knows business so well. You will be good enough to pardon my necessary
incivility: most painful to me it has been to refuse your request, backed by such excellent
reasons,--but you will accompany Mr. Hogarth, and show you are not unforgiving."

Jane accepted the invitation willingly. Francis was not pressed for time; the bank had released
him without the usual notice, so he offered to accompany his cousin wherever she chose to go to.

"Do you think," said she, when they were again in the street, "that I could get employment
with any bookseller or publisher? I will try that next. Will you go with me to a respectable
house in that line of business?"

There was no situation vacant for any one in the first two establishments they called at. In
the third there was a reader wanted to correct manuscripts and proofs, and as Mr. Hogarth was
supposed to be the person applying for the employment, he was asked his qualifications. When
he somewhat awkwardly put forward Miss Melville, the publisher respectfully but firmly declined
to engage her.

"Whatever I could or could not do--whatever salary I might ask--you object on account of my
being a woman?" said Jane.

"Just so," said the publisher; "it is not the custom of the trade to employ LADIES OF THE PRESS.
You do not know the terms or the routine of the business."

"I suppose I could learn them in an hour or two; but I see you do not wish to employ me, even
if I had them at my finger-ends. Do you employ women in no way in your large establishment?"

"Yes, as authors; for we find that many books written by ladies sell quite as well as others."

"But in no other way?"

"Only in this," said the publisher, taking the cousins into a small room at the back of his
large front shop, where eight or ten nice-looking girls were busily engaged in stitching together
pamphlets and sheets to be ready for the bookbinder. "It is light work; they have not such
long hours or such bad air, nor do they need much taste or skill as dressmakers do."

"So their wages are proportionally lower," said Jane.

"Just so," said the publisher; "and quite right they should be so."

"Of course; but do they not rise from stitching to bookbinding?"

"Ah! that is man's work. I have bookbinders on the premises, to finish the work that the girls
have begun."

"And they spend their lives in this stitching--no progress--no improvement--mere mechanical
drudgery."

"Yes; and in time they get very expert. You would be amazed at the rapidity with which they
turn the work out of their hands. The division of labour reduces the price of binding materially."

"No doubt--for you have girls at low wages to do what is tedious, and men at higher to do what
is artistic; that is a very fair division of labour," said Jane, bitterly.

"Nay, nay; I believe our profession, or rather trade, is more liberal to the sex than any other.
Write a good book, and will give you a good price for it: design a fine illustration, and that
has a market value independent of sex."

"I can neither write nor draw," said Jane, "but I would fain have been a corrector of the press;
from that I might have risen to criticism, and become a reader and a judge of manuscript; but
I see the case is hopeless. I suppose it is not you, but society who is to blame. Perhaps I
may be reduced to the book-stitching yet; if so, will you give me a trial? In the meantime,
I wish you good morning."

The publisher smiled and nodded. "A most eccentric young woman, and, I daresay, a deserving
one; but she takes hold of the world at the wrong end," said he, as she went out to pursue
her inquiry elsewhere.

"Now," said Jane, "I can release you, for I will make my next application myself. If I fail
here I really will be surprised, for I make it to one who knows me."

Mrs. Dunn, the head of the dressmaking and millinery establishment where the Miss Melvilles
had been initiated into these arts, had been very handsomely paid for instructing them, had
always praised Jane's industry and Elsie's taste, and had held them up as patterns for all
her young people. Of course she knew, as all the world knew, that they had been disinherited
by their uncle, but she fancied they had other influential friends or relatives; so when Miss
Melville was announced, she thought more of an order for mourning then of a request for employment.
But the young lady, in her own plain way, went at once to the point.

"You were accustomed at the time I was with you to have a bookkeeper, who came regularly to
make up your bills and your accounts. Have you the same arrangement still?"

"Yes, and the same gentleman; a first-rate hand at his figures; employed by many beside me,"
said Mrs. Dunn.

"Then he cannot miss one customer. Will you give the business to me on the same terms, for
the sake of old times?"

"To you, Miss Melville! it is not worth your having. It is only by his having so many that
he makes it pay, though he is as good an accountant as any in Edinburgh."

"I might in time get a good many too. Surely women might put all their work in the way of their
own sex. I am quite competent; I convinced a bank manager to-day that I was fit for a situation
in his establishment, but he did not like the idea of taking a young woman amongst his clerks.
You can have no objection on that score. You know I will be quiet, careful, and methodical."

Mrs. Dunn was very sorry, but really nobody ever thought of having young ladies to make up
their books. It was not the custom of any trade. A gentleman coming in gave confidence both
to herself and to the public; and she had no fault to find with Mr. McDonald--a most gentlemanly
man, with a wife and family, too--it would not be fair to part with him without any cause.
And, indeed, the business was not what it used to be--it needed the most careful management
to get along, and she could not risk having a change in her establishment just at present;
perhaps by-and-by.

"While grass grows horses starve," said Jane. "If I establish a reputation and get employment
from others you could not object to me. Everyone is alike; neither man nor woman will give
me a chance.

"I cannot blame you, Mrs. Dunn, for thinking and acting so much like other people."

"I am sure it would be better for you to take a nice comfortable situation; but I thought you
had friends. If there was any other way that I could serve you in I would be so happy. If you
had asked to be taken into the work-room--but I suppose you look higher."

"I do not know how low I may look ere long, Mrs. Dunn. It is quite possible I may trouble you
again, but in the meantime----"

"In the meantime I want you to come into the show-room and see the new sleeve just out from
Paris--it would improve the dress you have on amazingly. I suppose that was made in Swinton.
And you must see Mademoiselle; she is with us still, and as positive as ever; and many of the
young people you will recognise. How we have all talked about you and Miss Alice lately. It
was such an extraordinary settlement!"

Jane forced herself into the show-room, listened mechanically to the exclamations and remarks
of Mademoiselle, the forewoman, shook hands with all the work-girls she had known, looked with
vacant eyes on the new sleeve, and heard its merits descanted on very fully; then went back
into Mrs. Dunn's parlour, and had a glass of ginger wine and a piece of seed-cake with her;
after which she took leave, and Mrs. Dunn felt satisfied, for she had paid Miss Melville a
great deal of attention in spite of her altered circumstances.

"Where am I to go to now?" said Jane to herself as she again trod the pavement of Princes Street
and walked along it, then turned up into the quieter parts of the town where professions are
carried on. She passed by shops, and warehouses, banks and insurance companies' offices, commission
agencies, land agencies, lawyer's offices.

"Every one seems busy, every place filled, and there appears to be no room for me," she said
to herself. "I must try Mr. MacFarlane, however; he knows something of me, and will surely
feel friendly. I hope he will not be so much astonished at my views as other people have been."

Mr MacFarlane, however, was quite as much surprised as Mr. Rennie, or the publisher, when Jane
asked him for employment as a copying or engrossing clerk, either indoors or out of doors.
He was quite as much disposed to exaggerate the difficulties she herself would feel from not
understanding the forms of law, or not being able to write the particular style of caligraphy
required for legal instruments. He had heard of the singular education Henry Hogarth, an old
crony and contemporary of his own, had given to his nieces, and as his own old-bachelor crotchets
lay in quite another direction, he had never thought of that education doing anything but adding
to their difficulties, and preventing them from getting married. When the girls had been left
in poverty he only thought of their trying for the nice quiet situations that every one recommended,
but which seemed so hard to obtain, and then sinking into obscure old maidenhood in the bosom
of a respectable family. When Jane mentioned the matronship, Mr. MacFarlane strongly advised
her to apply for it, for the salary was more than she could look for in a situation, and she
would probably be more independent. But as for him employing a girl as a law-writer, what would
the profession say to that? It was quite out of the question.

"I fear I have no turn for teaching, but I suppose I must try for something better than a situation.
Could I not get up classes?"

"Oh! yes, certainly--classes if you feel competent."

"Not quite for French or Italian. My uncle was never satisfied with our accent; and we must
advertise French acquired on the Continent now-a-days, if we want to succeed in Edinburgh.
The things I could teach best--English grammar and composition, writing and arithmetic, history,
and the elements of science--are monopolized by men; but I must make an effort. I am sorry
my dear old friend, Mr. Wilson, is no more, he would have recommended me strongly; but I will
go to Mr. Bell. I studied under him for four winters, and though I am threatening him with
competition, I know I was his favourite pupil, and I hope he will help me. I never would encroach
on his field if I could find any elbow-room elsewhere."

This was another long walk, and to no purpose, for Mr. Bell was away from home, in bad health,
for an indefinite period, leaving his classes in the care of a young man, who had been strongly
recommended to him.

The other masters she had had were not likely to take nearly so much interest in her as Mr.
Bell; but she was resolved to leave no stone unturned, and went to see several of them. They
gave Miss Melville very faint hopes of success. Edinburgh was overdone with masters and mistresses,
rents were very high, and classes the most uncertain things possible. But she might apply at
one of the institutions. Thither she went, and found that her want of accomplishments prevented
her from getting a good situation; and her want of experience was objected to for any situation
at all. With a few more lessons, and a little training, she might suit by-and-by.

She was glad that those long walks and many interviews occupied the whole day till the time
Francis had appointed for dinner; she had not courage to face the empty house and the respectable
woman-servant till she was sure her cousin would be at home to receive her. Heartsick, weary,
and footsore she felt, when she reached the cottage where Francis was standing at the door
to welcome her return.

"Well, friend," said he, "what news?"

"No good news. I suppose I must advertise. Perhaps there is one person in England or Scotland
who would fancy I was worth employing, even though I am apparently very much at a discount."

"Are you much disheartened?"

"I am very tired," said she; "Rome was not built in a day. I was a fool to expect success at once."

"You are not too tired to go to Mrs. Rennie's with me this evening. I have ordered a carriage
to call for us."

"Thank you, I will need it, and my dinner, too, in spite of the wine and cake at Mrs. Dunn's."

Her cousin's quiet sympathy and kindness soothed the girl's aching and anxious heart; she told
him her experiences; and though he was not very much surprised at the result, he felt keenly
for her disappointment. She had brought a little piece of needlework to fill up vacant hours,
and after dinner she took it out, and soothed her excited feelings by the quiet feminine employment.
There was an hour or more to be passed before the carriage came for them, and Francis sat on
the other side of the fire cutting the leaves of a new book, and occasionally reading a passage
that struck him. Had any one looked in at the time, he could not have guessed at the grief
and anxiety felt by both of the cousins. No; it was like a quiet domestic picture of no recent
date, not likely to be soon ended. Jane's sad face lighted up with an occasional smile at something
said or something read; and Francis Hogarth saw more beauty in her countenance that evening
than William Dalzell had ever seen in all the days he had spent with the supposed heiress whom
he meant to marry.

Chapter IV.

An Evening At Mr. Rennie's

After an hour spent in this quiet way, Jane Melville was sufficiently rested and tranquillized
to go among strangers, in spite of her knowing the idle curiosity with which she was likely
to be regarded. There was a small party at Mr. Rennie's; but excepting herself and the ladies
of the family, it was composed entirely of gentlemen. Now that Mr. Hogarth had come into a
good landed property, he had spent more than one evening in the family of the bank manager,
and had been discovered to be presentable anywhere; that he had very tolerable manners and
good literary taste; and both Mrs. and Miss Rennie recollected well how often papa had spoken
highly of him when he was only a clerk in the bank. Miss Rennie was about nineteen, the eldest
of the family, rather pretty, slightly romantic, and a little fond of showing off her extensive
acquaintance with modern literature. Her interest in Mr. Hogarth was great, though of recent
date; and now to see one of the cousins whom he was forbidden to marry, on pain of losing all
his newly-acquired wealth and consequence, was an exciting thing to a young lady who had suffered
much from want of excitement. Her father had been able to tell her nothing of Miss Melville
s personal appearance, though he had dwelt upon her abilities and her eccentric character,
and told her age. Among the party was the publisher to whom Jane had applied for a situation,
who had contributed his share of information about her; a young Edinburgh advocate, who had
not very much to do at the bar; a Leith merchant, an old gentleman of property in the neighbourhood
of the city, and two college students, all anxious to see people who were so much talked about.

"Decidedly plain and common-looking, and looks twenty-seven at least," was Miss Rennie's verdict
on seeing Miss Melville.

"Plain, but uncommon-looking," was the opinion of the gentlemen on the subject. The open, intelligent,
and womanly expression of countenance--the well-turned neck and shoulders--the easy, well-proportioned
figure--though not of the slight ethereal style which Mr. Hawthorne admires, but rather of
the healthy, well-developed flesh-and-blood character of British feminine beauty--might redeem
a good deal of irregularity of features.

Though her self-possession had been sorely tried on this day, though she had been disappointed,
and was now worn out and perplexed, and though her faith in human nature had been shaken, she
made an effort to recover the equanimity necessary for such an evening as this, and succeeded.
Her quiet and lady-like manner surprised Mr. Rennie; he had thought her masculine in the morning.
She listened with patience and pleasure to Miss Rennie's playing and singing, and then looked
over some books of engravings and prints with the old gentleman, who was a connoisseur. And
when the advocate and the publisher, between whom there seemed to be a good understanding,
entered into conversation on literary matters, and successful and unsuccessful works, she,
thinking of her sister and her hopes, listened most attentively.

"Well," said the legal gentleman, "I like smart, clever writing, and don't object to a little
personality now and then. It pays, too."

"Those things certainly take well," said the publisher, "but there are other things that take
better."

"What are they?"

"Not at all in your way, Mr. Malcolm; but yet at the present time there is nothing that pays
so well as an exciting religious novel on evangelical principles. Make all your unbelievers
and worldly people villians, and crown your heroine, after unheard-of perils and persecutions,
with the conversion of her lover, or the lover with the conversion of the heroine--the one
does nearly as well as the other; but do not let them marry before conversion, on any account.
Settle the hero down in the ministry, to which he dedicates talents that you may call as splendid
as you please; make your fashionable conversation of your worldly people slightly blackguardly,
and that of your pets very inane, with spots of religion coming out very strong now and then,
and you will have more readers than Dickens, Bulwer, or Thackeray. Well-meaning mothers will
put the book without fear into the hands of their daughters. It is considered harmless Sunday
reading for those who find Sunday wearisome, and it is thought an appropriate birth-day present
for young people of both sexes. I dare say these books are harmless enough, but their success
is wonderfully disproportioned to their merits. They must be such easy writing, too, for you
need never puzzle yourself as to whether it would be natural or consistent for such a character
to steal, or for another to murder. 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked,' and the novelist at least takes no pains to know it."

"You fire me with a noble zeal and emulation," said Mr. Malcolm. "Is it true that the trumpery
thing my sister Anne tormented me to order from you last week has gone through five editions?"

"Just about to bring out a sixth," said the publisher; "and the curious thing is that it is
not at all exciting: but these American domestic quasi-religious novels (though novel is not
a proper term for them) are the rage at present. If one could trust to their details of every-day
life being correct, they might be useful as giving us the Americans painted by themselves;
but there is so much that is false and improbable in plot and character, that one is tempted
to doubt even the cookery, of which we have QUANTUM SUFF."

"The conversation is the greatest twaddle I ever saw," said Mr. Malcolm. "If the American people
talk like that, how fatiguing it would be to live among them! I could not write so badly, or
such bad English. I must take a successful English novel as my model."

"Mr. Malcolm is literary himself," said Miss Rennie, who had left the two students to amuse
each other, and now joined the more congenial group. "He writes such clever things in magazines,
Miss Melville, I quite delight to come on anything of his, they are so amusing."

"Miss Rennie, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for your good opinion. Then you like my style?
Do you hear that, you ogre? Publishers, you know, Miss Melville, are noted for living upon
the bones of unfortunate authors, and never saying grace either before or after the meal. This
Goth, this Vandal, this Jacob Tonson, has had the barbarity to find fault with the last thing
I put into the "Mag"."

"Well, I thought you had never done anything so good. It was so funny; papa laughed till he
shook the spectacles off his face, and then all the children laughed too."

"Listen, thou devourer of innocents, thou fattener on my labour and groans. My work was good,
and my style better, fashionable as Miss Rennie's flounces, and piquant as the sauce we will
have from our host at supper."

"The style has been fashionable," said the publisher, "but it is getting overdone. Everybody
is trying the allusive style now, and wandering from the subject in hand to quote a book, or
to refer to something very remotely connected with it. Every word or sentence is made a peg
to hang something else on. Our authors are too fond of showing off reading or curious information;
the style of the old essayists----"

"Bald and tame, with very little knowledge of the finer shades of character," interrupted Mr.
Malcolm. "I wonder why you, as a critic, can compare our brilliant modern literature to such
poor performances."

"They have their deficiencies, certainly; but there was a simplicity and directness in these
old writings that we would do well to imitate."

"I had better imitate the style of the paying article at present, and write an evangelical
novel. I had better read up in it; but the unlucky thing is that they invariably put me to
sleep; so perhaps I would do better to trust to my own original genius, and begin in an independent
manner."

"Is it not a treat," whispered Miss Rennie to Jane, "to get a peep behind the scenes in this
way? Mr. Malcolm is quite a genius. I am sure he could write anything; but he really ought
not to go to sleep over those charming books. He is such a severe critic, I am quite afraid
of him."

"Then you write yourself?" said Jane.

"Oh! how foolish of me to let you know in such a silly way. I write nothing to speak of. I
never thought any one would take me for an authoress. But I do so doat on poetry, and it seems
so natural to express one's feelings in verse--not for publication, you know--only for my friends.
Once or twice--but this is a great secret--I have had pieces brought out in the 'Ladies' Magazine.'
If you read it, you may have seen them; they had the signature of Ella--a pretty name, is it
not?--more uncommon than my own."

"Is it a fair question," said Jane, anxiously; "but did you receive anything for your verses?"

"You have such a commercial turn of mind, Miss Melville, as papa says, that you really ought
to be in business. No; I did not receive or, indeed, did I wish for any payment. I would mix
no prose with my poetry."

"You are not in need of money," said Jane, with a slight sigh; and she turned to the publisher,
and asked if he brought out new poems as well as new novels.

"Poetry is ticklish stuff to go off, particularly in Edinburgh," said he. "I am very shy of
it, except in bringing out cheap editions of poems of established reputation, or reprints of
American poets."

"Where there is no copyright to be paid for," said Mr. Malcolm; "I know the tricks of the trade."

Mrs. Rennie had asked Jane to play and sing, which she could not do, and then had engaged in
conversation with Mr. Hogarth for a considerable time. Now she supposed Jane must fancy she
was not receiving sufficient attention from her hostess, considering that she was the only
lady guest, so she came forward, and withdrew her from the animated conversation of the gentlemen,
and proceeded to entertain her in the best way that she could. Her younger children (not her
youngest, for they were in bed) were gathered around her, and the conversation was somewhat
desultory, owing to their interruptions and little delinquencies. It was now getting time for
them, too, to go to bed, and it was not without repeated orders from mamma, supported at last
by a forcible observation from papa, that they bade the company good-night, and retired. They
were all very nice-looking children, and not ill-disposed, though somewhat refractory and dilatory
about the vexed question of going to bed.

Talking to them and about them naturally brought up the subject of education; and Jane timidly
inquired if Mrs. Rennie was in want of a governess, or if she knew any one who was.

"No; the children are all at school or under masters--the best masters in Edinburgh--for Mr.
Rennie is extravagant in the matter of education. The children get on better--there is more
emulation; and then there is such a houseful of ourselves, that we would not know where to
put a governess, though it might otherwise be an economy," said Mrs. Rennie.

"I should like to have classes," said Jane--trying to speak boldly for herself; "to teach what
I have learned under the same masters whom you are so pleased with--English philologically,
with the practice of composition, writing, arithmetic, and mathematics. I can get certificates
of my competency from the professors under whom I have studied. I must leave the neighbourhood
of Swinton, where there is no field for me, and start in this line; my sister can assist me,
I have no doubt."

"I never heard of such a thing, Miss Melville; you had much better take a situation. The worry
and uncertainty of taking rooms and paying rent, when there are so many masters that you cannot
expect but a very few pupils, would wear you out in a twelvemonth. If I were to send you my
two girls--and I am sure I have every reason to be satisfied with their present teachers--what
would they do for you? Oh, no, Miss Melville. Take my advice, and get a nice quiet situation,
or go into a school, where you might take music lessons in exchange for what you can teach now."

"I am too old to learn music," said Jane, "and I have no natural talent for it. As for a nice
quiet situation, where am I to get it?"

"Surely, Miss Melville, you must have many friends, from the position you have held in ----shire;
you must know many leading people. Consult with them. I am sure they would never advise you
to take such a risk; I cannot conscientiously advise you to do it myself. Mr. Rennie was telling
me about the matronship of the ---- Institution. Don't you think that would be better? The
salary is not high, but there is no risk. I know one of the house-surgeons very well, and I
know he says everything is very comfortable, and he is one of the pleasantest men I know."

"I am reconsidering the matter," said Jane. "I suppose if I make up my mind to it, the sooner
I apply the better."

"I should say so," said Mrs. Rennie. "I am sure Mr. Rennie will give you all his influence,
for he says you appear to be such a capable person. He told us all about your turn for figures
and ledgers, and that sort of thing."

"I have naturally strong nerves, too," said Jane.

"Oh, they say it is nothing being in such a place, when you once get used to it."

"But what would become of my poor sister?" said Jane. "We did so much wish to be together;
and in such a situation I could see so little of her."

"That would be the case in any situation; and what is there to prevent her from getting one
for herself?"

"Just as much and more than prevents me. Still, twenty-four and thirty pounds a year would
keep her tolerably comfortable till she can get employment or meets with success otherwise,"
said Jane, half thinking aloud. "I think I will write out my application when we get home to-night."

"Where are you staying--in Edinburgh?" asked Mrs. Rennie.

"At my cousin's."

"At Mr. Hogarth's?--you do not mean to say so!"

"He asked me to come and stay with him while I inquired about this situation, or anything else
that might appear to be better. You know I cannot afford to take lodgings or live at a hotel,
and no one else thought of offering me a home."

"It was very kind and well-meant on his part, no doubt; but it was scarcely advisable on yours
to accept it."

"I spoke to Miss Thomson about it, and she saw no objection."

"Miss Thomson of Allendale: very likely she did not--she is used to do just as she pleases,
and never minds what the world thinks."

"She was the only person who gave me either help, encouragement, or advice. I thought all she
said was right and reliable. You do not know what it is to me, who have no relation in the
world but Elsie, to find a cousin. He seems like a brother to me, and I know he feels like
one. If it had been in his power to give me money to engage a lodging, perhaps he would have
done so, but it is money assistance that is so strictly forbidden by the will."

"If he had only spoken to some experienced friend on the subject--if he had only spoken to
ME--I am sure it could have been better managed. In the meantime, if you have no objection
to sharing Eliza's room, we will be glad to keep you here for the remainder of your stay in
Edinburgh. You had better not go home with your cousin to-night."

Jane paused for a few minutes--many bitter thoughts passed through her mind. "I am much obliged
to you for your kind offer, but I do not think I can accept it. If I have made a mistake, it
has been committed already, and cannot be undone. To-night, I will write my application to
the directors of the ---- Asylum; tomorrow I will be on my way to Cross Hall. I cannot, after
such a day as this, collect my thoughts sufficiently in a strange house, among strangers, to
do myself justice in my application, nor can I bear to let my cousin know that his brotherly
kindness, and my sisterly confidence, may be misunderstood and misinterpreted. I have no mother,
and no adviser. I had feared that perhaps the direct or indirect assistance of food and lodging
for two days might peril my cousin's inheritance,--though Miss Thomson thought there was no
danger of that either,--but I never imagined that any one would think the less of me for accepting
it. If you do not tell him, he need never know it; for I am sure it was the last idea he could
have entertained."

What sad earnest eyes Jane turned on Mrs. Rennie!--she could not help being touched with her
expression and her appeal. A vision of her own Eliza--without friends--without a mother--doing
something as ill-advised, and feeling very acutely when a stranger told her of it, gave a distinctness
to Jane's present suffering that, without that little effort of imagination, she could not
have realized. Besides, she had a great wish to think highly of Mr. Hogarth, and to please
him; and the certainty that he would be extremely pained and, perhaps, offended by her suggestion
that he had compromised his cousin's position by his good-natured invitation, had its influence.

"What you say is very reasonable, Miss Melville, but you forget that to-morrow is Sunday. You
would not travel on the Sabbath, I hope?"

"I seem to have forgotten the days of the week in this terrible whirl," said Jane. "I would
rather not travel on Sunday, but this seems a case of necessity."

"Not so," said Mrs. Rennie, kindly. "Come and go to church with us to-morrow forenoon, and
dine with us; if you feel then that you would prefer to stay here, you can easily manage to
do so without making your cousin suspect anything. If you still are anxious to go home, you
can do that on Monday morning; but I fancy Tuesday is quite early enough to send in your application."

"Thank you, Mrs. Rennie," said Jane. "I am very much obliged to you indeed for your kindness,
and I think I will avail myself of it; but to-night--to-night--I must have some quiet and solitude."

"I have been somehow or other separated from you all the evening," said Francis, as they were
on their way home. "Have you enjoyed it at all? It was hard for you to have to see so many
strangers after so trying a day."

"Rather hard," said Jane, with quivering lips. "Life altogether is much harder than I had imagined
it to be. I want Elsie very much to-night; but I will see her as soon as I can possibly get home."

"You do not mean to go so soon? you have done nothing satisfactory as yet. We must make attempts
in some other direction."

"I have made up my mind," said Jane; "I will apply for the situation I despised this morning.
People outside of asylums seem to be as mad and more cruel. I will write my application to-night,
and it will go by the first post."

"Do not be so precipitate; there is no need to apply before Tuesday, and I believe even Wednesday
would do. Spend the intervening days in town; something suitable may be advertised in newspapers.
You have not yet applied at any registry offices. You said Rome was not built in a day, yet
a day's failure makes you despair. Do not lose heart all at once, my dear cousin. Though I
never had anything half so hard to bear or to anticipate as you have now, I have had my troubles,
and have got over them, as you will in the end."

The tone of Francis' voice gave Jane a little courage; but she was resolute in writing out
her application before she went to bed. It was beautifully written and clearly expressed. She
asserted her qualifications with firmness, and yet with modesty, and gave satisfactory references
to prove her own statements. Of all the applicants, she was the youngest; but Francis was sure
that her letter would be the best of the fifty.

Though Jane thought this decisive step would set her mind at rest, sleep was impossible to
her after such excitement, fatigue, and disappointment; and the solitude she had longed for
only gave her leave to turn over all the painful circumstances of her position without let
or hindrance. Never had she felt so bitterly towards her uncle. In vain did she try to recall
his past kindness to soften her heart towards him; for all pleasant memories only deepened
the gloom of her present friendless, hopeless poverty; and the prospect of her inevitable separation
from Elsie, which had never been distinctly apprehended before, was the saddest of all the
thoughts that haunted the night watches.

Francis had been invited with Jane to spend the day with the Rennies, and the cousins went
to church with the family. Jane heard none of the sermon nor of the service generally. She
had not been in the habit of paying much attention at church, and there was nothing at all
striking or impressive in the preacher's voice or manner, or in the substance of his discourse,
to arrest a languid or preoccupied listener. Jane was thinking about the Asylum, and about
how much or how little it needed to make people mad--if they were often cured--and if they
relapsed--a great part of the time; and when Miss Rennie asked her how she liked the sermon,
Jane could not tell whether she liked it or not. Mr. and Mrs. Rennie confessed that Mr. M----
was nothing of a preacher, but he was a very good man and a private friend. They liked to go
to their own regular parish church, and did not run after celebrated preachers; though Eliza
was a great admirer of eloquence, and was very often straying from her own place of worship
to go with friends and acquaintances to hear some star or another, quite indifferent as to
whether he were of the Establishment or of the Free Kirk, or of some other dissenting persuasion.

The conversation at Mr. Rennie's all Sunday afternoon was much more on churches, sermons, and
ministers, than any Jane had ever heard before. She had never seen anything of the religious
world, as it is called, and felt herself very much behind the company in information. Her cousin
Francis was much better acquainted with the subject; he seemed to have heard every preacher
in Edinburgh, and to know every one of note in the kingdom.

Mrs. Rennie, apparently in a casual manner, asked Jane to make her house her home while she
remained in Edinburgh; and the invitation was accepted with the same indifferent tone of voice,
which concealed great anxiety at heart.

"I should like my cousin to accompany me to my unfashionable chapel," said Francis. "Will you
either join us or excuse us for the evening, as it is the only opportunity I may have for a
long time to take Miss Melville there? Miss Rennie, you are the only one likely to have curiosity
enough to try a new church."

"I am sorry I cannot go this evening, for I have promised to go to St. George's, to hear Mr.
C----, with Eleanor Watson and her brother. You had better come with me; it is the last Sunday
he is to preach in Edinburgh," said Miss Rennie.

"You must excuse me this once," said Mr. Hogarth; "I have a great wish that Miss Melville should
hear my minister. At any other time I will be at your command."

Miss Rennie could not disappoint either Eleanor or Herbert Watson, or herself; so Francis and
Jane went alone to the little chapel.

"It will do you good to hear a good sermon, and I expect that you will hear one."

The idea of getting any good at church was rather new to Jane; but on this occasion, for the
first time in her life, she felt real meaning in religious worship. Never before had she felt
the sentiment of dependence, which is the primary sentiment of religion. She had been busy,
and prosperous, and self-reliant; all she said and did had been considered good and wise; her
position was good, her temper even, and her pleasures many. Now she was baffled and defeated
on every side--disappointed in the present, and fearful of the future.

Prayer acquired a significance she had never seen in it before; the tone of the prayer, too,
was different from the set didactic utterances too often called prayer, in which there is as
much doctrine and as little devotion as extempore prayer is capable of. It was not expostulatory
either, as if our Heavenly Father needed much urging to make Him listen to our wants and our
aspirations, but calm, trusting, and elevated, as if God was near, and not far off from any
one of His creatures--as if we could lay our griefs and our cares, our joys and our hopes,
at His feet, knowing that we are sure of His blessing. Was this union with God, then, really
possible? Was there an inner life that could flow on smoothly and calmly heavenward, in spite
of the shocks, and jars, and temptations of the outer life? Could she learn to see and acknowledge
God's goodness even in the bitterness of the cup that was now at her lips?

It was no careless or preoccupied listener who followed point after point of the sermon on
the necessity of suffering for the perfecting of the Christian character. The thoughts were
genuine thoughts, not borrowed from old books, but worked out of the very soul of the preacher;
and the language, clear, vigorous, and modern, clothed these thoughts in the most impressive
manner. There were none of the conventionalisms of the pulpit orator, who often weakens the
strongest ideas by the hackneyed or obsolete phraseology he uses.

"Thank you, cousin Francis," said Jane, as they walked back to Mr. Rennie's together. "This
is, indeed, medicine to a mind diseased. I will make my inquiries as I ought to do tomorrow;
but if I fail I will send in my application; and if I succeed there, I will go to this asylum
in a more contented spirit. It appears as if it were to be my work, and with God's help I will
do it well."

Jane began her next day's work by calling on her Edinburgh acquaintances, and then went to
the registry offices; but Monday's inquiries were no more successful than Saturday's; so she
dropped her letter in the post, and felt as many people, especially women, do when an important
missive has left them for ever to go to the hands to which it is addressed. It seems so irrevocable,
they doubt the wisdom of the step and fear the consequences.

When Jane reached home and told her sister of the application she had sent in, Elsie was horrified
at the prospect, and shook her sister's courage still more by the pictures she conjured up
of Jane's life at such a place, and of her own without the one dearest to her heart; but after
she had said all she could in that way, it occurred to her that if her poems succeeded, as
she had no doubt they would, Jane's slavery need but be shortlived. Her work had made great
progress during the short time of her sister's absence, and she continued to apply to it with
indefatigable industry. Scarcely would the ardent girl allow herself to think of anything but
what to write;--the tension was too severe, but Elsie would take nothing in moderation.

Chapter V.

A Humble Friend

The last week of the Misses Melville's stay at Cross Hall had begun before Jane heard of the
result of her application for the matronship of the ---- Institution. Mr. Rennie then wrote
to her that the directors had appointed a widow, very highly recommended, and apparently very
well qualified. Miss Melville's letter had received careful attention, and had favourably impressed
all the directors; but her youth and her being unmarried were great objections to her, while
the kind of housekeeping she had conducted at her uncle's was not likely to be the best school
for the management of an establishment of this kind. Mr. Rennie was very sorry for Miss Melville's
disappointment, but he could not suggest any other situation likely to suit her.

Elsie jumped for joy when she heard of Jane's rejection, and kissed her sister over and over
again. "We shall not be parted, darling; you will not go to slave among strangers and to be
terrified by mad people. I cannot--really, I cannot do without you--you are my muse and my
critic, as well as my best friend and adviser."

Jane was not quite so much exhilarated by her failure as her sister; but Elsie's extravagant
delight comforted her not a little. While they were talking over this matter, Jane was called
away to receive the linen from the laundress for the last time, and to bid her good-bye. Peggy
Walker was somewhat of an authority in the district--a travelled woman, who had been in Australia
and back again, and was now living with a family of orphan nephews and nieces, and an old man,
their grandfather. Public rumour pronounced her a niggardly woman, for though she had property
she worked as hard as if she had nothing, and took the bread out of other folk's mouths; but
as she was really an excellent laundress, she had the best custom in the neighbourhood, and
her honesty, her punctuality, and her homely civility, had made her a great favourite with
Jane Melville.

"I fear it must be good-bye this time, Peggy," said she; "next week's washing must be given
to other hands."

"Eh, now, Miss Jean, ye dinna say so. I heard the new man was coming to the Hall, but no just
so very soon as that. But ye are no going out of the place for good?"

"For good or ill, Peggy, we leave Cross Hall next Thursday."

"And where are you going to?"

"I wish I knew."

"Preserve us, Miss Jean! Are you and Miss Elsie, poor bit thing, unacquainted with where you
are going to?"

"It is only too true."

"Well, I am going to leave the place too; but I ken well where I am going, and that is to Edinburgh."

"Why are you leaving Swinton? I thought you were doing very well here."

"I don't say that I have any cause to complain of my prosperity here; but, you see, Tam is
wild to learn the engineering, and he wants to go to Edinburgh, where he thinks he will learn
it best; and I don't like to let him go by himsel', for though he is no a bad laddie, he is
the better of a home and a head to it, and I would like to keep my eye on him. Grandfather
makes no objections, and the bairns are all keen for Edinburgh, so I am going to flit next
week. As for leaving this place, I am sure I have been growled at quite enough about coming
from Australia and taking work away from my old neighbours, so I will try my luck where I don't
know who I am taking custom from. I've been in and got a house and a mangle in a nice quiet
part of the town, no owre far from Tam's place where he is going to work, and a healthy bit
it looks, too."

"Peggy, I wish I had your confidence and your reason for confidence. I, too, want to go to
Edinburgh to try my luck there; but though my uncle spent quite a fortune on my education,
and though I did my best to profit by it, I really can see no way of making my living."

"Hout tout," said Peggy, "no fear of you making a living, you could do that as well as me;
but it is more than a living for yourself you are wanting; you are thinking of Miss Elsie,
poor bit lassie, and would fain work for two. I mind well when my sister left the bairns to
my care with her dying breath, I felt my heart owre grit. It was more than I, a single woman,
with but seven pounds by the year of wages, could hope to do, to keep the bit creatures; but
yet it was borne on my mind that I was to do it, and God be praised that He has given me the
strength and the opportunity, and it is little burden they have been to any other body; and
in due time, when they have got learning enough, and are come the length to get the passage,
I will take them back with me to Melbourne, where their prospects will be better than in the
old country."

"Oh, Peggy! would Australia suit us? Would you advise us to go there?"

"No, Miss Melville, I scarcely think so. For the like of me it is the best place in the world;
for the like of you I cannot be at all clear about it. I'll tell you my story some day, but
not now, for I am pressed for time, getting everything in readiness for the flitting; and I
want time to collect my thoughts; my memory is none of the best. But, Miss Melville, if I am
not making too free, I have a little room in my new house that I would be blithe to let you
and Miss Elsie have, and you could stay there quietly till something turns up for you."

"If we can afford the rent."

"Oh, the rent!" said Peggy; "you need not think about the rent, if you could only give the
lasses a lesson in sewing (for I'm no very skilful with the needle, and my hands are so rough
with the washing and dressing that the thread aye hanks on my fingers), and make out my washing
bills for my Customers that are not so methodical as yourself. As for writing and counting,
it is my abomination. There need no rent pass between us."

"Thank you, Peggy, thank you; that will suit us nicely. But tell me, can we--that is, Elsie
and me--can we live in Edinburgh on twenty-four pounds a-year?"

"I have known many a family brought up decently on as little, or even less," said Peggy; "but
then they were differently bred from you and could live hard. Porridge and potatoes, and muslin
kail, with a salt herring now and then."

"Well, porridge and potatoes it shall be," said Jane, "for three years, and then starvation,
if the world pleases."

"If God pleases, Miss Jane; the chief thing is for us to place our trust in Him," said Peggy.

"You are right, Peggy, I suppose; but it is hard to unlearn so much old schooling and to accept
of new teachings. Did your faith support you when you were perplexed and disappointed--when
friends were unfaithful, and the world hard and cruel?"

"My trials have not been just like yours; but whatever God sent, He gave me strength to bear;
and it will be the same with you, Miss Jean, if you put yourself humbly in His hands. But the
auld laird cared for none of these things; though I am sure when he left you so poorly provided
for in this world, he behoved to have given you a good hold of the hope of a better;--besides
that, it makes us contented with a very humble lot here below. I am, maybe, too free-spoken,
Miss Jean, but I mean no disrespect."

"No offence can be taken where none is meant, Peggy; and friends are too scarce with us now
for us to reject any good advice. I am very glad to know that we can subsist on our income,
for I have not been accustomed to deal with such small sums."

"You have wealth of clothes, no doubt; enough to last you for a while; so there need be no
outlay for that."

"And we have our own furniture--too much, I suppose for your little room. We can sell the overplus
when a push comes. I do not think anything could suit us better than your kind offer."

"I have heard," said Peggy, "that the folk hereabouts think you will be getting up a subscription."

"They are very much mistaken," said Jane; "the hardest living is preferable to that. I wish
you could say that Melbourne, or any part of Australia, would do for us. Everybody was surprised
when you returned to Swinton so suddenly."

"Well, I could send the bairns more money from Melbourne than I can make for them here, and
no doubt the folk thought me foolish to leave such a place; but what good was the money to
the poor things when there was no management, for the old man is but silly, and the bairns
had mostly the upper hand of him, though whiles they did catch it. I have had my own ado with
Tam for the last two years. I think I have got the victory now; but I must try and keep it.
So, as grandfather dreads the water, I think I will stop in this country while he is to the
fore, and meantime the lads and lasses must have their schooling and Tam his trade. But I keep
on clavering about my own concerns, while you are in doubt and difficulties about yours. When
do you leave Cross Hall?"

"I should like to leave on Wednesday, for my cousin comes to take possession on that day, and
Elsie cannot bear any one to see us bidding farewell to our dear old home."

"I cannot just flit before Thursday."

"Well, I suppose we must stay to welcome the new owner; I have no objection to doing so."

"It may be painful to your feelings, Miss Melville, but yet I think it would be but right.
There are things you may mention to the new man that would do good to them that are left behind
you. That poor blind widow, Jeanie Weir, that you send her dinner to every day, would miss
her dole if it was not kept up; and I know there are more than her that you want to speak a
good word for. I hear no ill of this Maister Francis; and though we all grudge him the kingdom
he has come into, it may be that he will rule it worthily."

Chapter VI.

A Bundle Of Old Letters

Elsie had a headache when Francis came to take possession of his new home, and scarcely made
her appearance; but Jane, who felt none of her sister's shrinking from him, showed him over
the house, and told him how it had been managed, hoped he would keep the present servants,
and particularly recommended to his care the gardener, who, though rather superannuated and
rheumatic, had been forty years in the service of the family, and understood the soil and the
treatment of it very well.

He was not only glad to hear what she said, but was resolved to be guided by it, and took a
memorandum of her poor pensioners, that they, at least, should not suffer by Mr. Hogarth's will.

Then she walked with him over the grounds, and pointed out what improvements her uncle had
made, and what more he had contemplated making. She was rather deficient in taste for rural
beauty. She loved Cross Hall because it was her home, and because she had been happy there,
rather than because she fully appreciated the loveliness of the situation and the prospect.
Her cousin, townsman as he was, had far more natural taste. It was romantically situated, and
the grounds were beautifully laid out; there were pretty hamlets in the distance, gentlemen's
country seats embowered in trees, green cornfields, merry brooks, and winding valleys. Francis'
eyes and heart were filled with the exceeding beauty of the landscape.

"You must be very sorry to leave all this Jane," he said.

"I believe that is the least of my troubles. I am more sorry to leave these;" and she led him
to the stables, and showed him the two beautiful horses she and her sister had been accustomed
to ride. "You will be kind to them for our sakes, and the dogs, too. I am--we are both--very
concerned to part with the dogs."

"Should you not like to take any of them with you?" said Francis, eagerly.

"No, no; dogs such as these would be a nuisance in a crowded little room in Edinburgh, and
I do not think they would like such a life, for their own part. You will take better care of
them than we could possibly do. But I forget: you have, perhaps, as little affection for animals
as I have taste for scenery."

"I am not naturally fond of pets--which is rather strange; for my solitary life should have
made me attach myself to the lower animals. But perhaps I am not naturally affectionate. I
must cultivate this deficient taste, however; and be assured that anything you have loved will
always be cherished by me; and every wish that you may express, or that I can even guess at,
that I am allowed to gratify, I will be only too happy to do so. It has been a strange and
stormy introduction we have had to each other; but I am so grateful to you for not hating me,
that I chafe still the more at the cruel way in which my hands are tied. I have consulted several
eminent lawyers in the hope of being enabled to overturn my father's will, but without success.
If a man is not palpably mad he may make as absurd a settlement of his own property as he pleases;
and your assertion of your uncle's peculiar opinions tends to support the validity of the testament.
Though no one thinks that the disposition of the money will serve the end Mr. Hogarth intended,
yet he believed it would, and the spirit and intention of the will must be carried out. Oh,
my father! why did you not give me a little love in your lifetime instead of this cursed money
after your death?"

"Cousin," said Jane cheerfully, "I believe you will make a good use of this money. As my uncle
says, you have served well, and should be able to rule justly and kindly. I do not think so
much about the improvement of the property by your taste as of the care you will take of the
condition of the people upon it. This last month has been a hard, but a useful school to me.
I have thought more of the real social difficulties of this crowded country than ever I did
before. Bringing my own talents and acquirements into the market, and finding myself elbowed
out by competition, I think of those who have to do the real hard necessary work of the world
with more sympathy and more respect. Not that I ever despised them--you must not imagine me
to be so hard-hearted as that; but my feeling for them is deepened and heightened wonderfully
of late. Now they are apt to say that PARVENUS are of all men the most exacting and the most
purse-proud; and that a mistress who has been a servant is harsher to her female dependants
than one who has been accustomed to keep domestics all her life. It is difficult for me to
conceive this; but there must be truth in it, or it would not be a proverb in all languages.
You will be an exception, Francis. You will have my uncle's real kindness without his crotchets
and his dictatorial manner. You must not be offended if I call you a parvenu in spite of your
birth. You have come suddenly into wealth that you were not brought up to expect."

"If I do not recollect my past life, I will certainly remember your present advice whenever
I am tempted to think too much of myself and too little of others."

"Everything is to lead to the perfecting of your character, you see," said Jane.

"I cannot bear even improvement at the expense of any one's suffering but my own," said Francis.

"I have been thinking so much about that sermon I heard at your church. I do not know that
the preacher brought out the particular point; but we are made such dependent beings, not only
on God, but on each other, that we do indirectly profit by what we do not purchase by our own
effort or pains. We would not choose to have it so; but when Providence brings on ourselves
or others sorrows we grieve for, we are right to draw from them all the good we can. It is
something if my uncle's rather unjust will has given you property with a sobered sense of its
privileges and a strong sense of its duties--something to set against Elsie's sufferings and
mine. And, besides, the loss of it has done me one great benefit."

"Tell me what," said Francis, eagerly.

"It is quite possible, though I cannot tell how probable, that I might have married a man to
whom I am not well suited in any respect, and who was still less adapted to make me happy if
I had not been disinherited. I am thus frank with you, cousin Francis, for I should like to
give you all the consolation I can."

"And you have been deserted by a lover, as well as impoverished; and you ask me to take consolation
from it."

"No, no; nothing so bad as that. I only explained matters to him, and we parted. I am very
glad of it. Be you the same," said Jane, looking frankly and cheerfully in her cousin's face,
and the cloud passed off it.

"Your sister has no affair of this kind?"

"No; nothing," said Jane.

"And yet she seems to suffer more."

"Not now; she is busy writing a volume of poems that is to make our fortune. Dear Elsie! I
hope it may."

"Poems--well, she may succeed; but I have more hope of you than of her."

"Because you know me better; but yet my efforts have all been very fruitless. I am not a judge
of poetry, though I like what Elsie writes. I wished her to consent to my taking your opinion
as to her verses, but she shrank from it with most unaccountable and, as I thought, unreasonable
fear. I wonder how she can bring her work before the public if she dreads one critic."

"It is very natural, Jane. Among the public there may be some to admire, and some to depreciate;
but the one critic to whom the author submits his work may be of the latter class, and there
seems to be no refuge from him. It is curious to see the revelations of the inner self that
some authors make to the world--revelations that they would often shrink from making to their
nearest friends. They appeal to the few in the world who sympathise with them, and disregard
the censure of all the rest. And recollect that, though to you I am a friend, your sister has
seen very little of me, and her first impression was exceedingly painful. If you have told
her I am a good judge of poetry, she will be all the more averse to submit her compositions
to my criticism, for my opinion might bias yours, and yours is her greatest comfort and encouragement.
No one can wish her success more earnestly than I do. But for yourself, what are your present
intentions?"

"If it were not for leaving Elsie, I might try for a situation as housekeeper in a large establishment;
I know I am fully competent for that. I should prefer something by which I could rise, but
the choice may not be given to me. We go to Edinburgh tomorrow. I do not think the small room
we are going to will hold all the furniture we are entitled to, so will you be good enough
to let what we cannot accommodate remain at Cross Hall till we can send for it?"

"Certainly; you had better lock up your room with your own things in it, and take the key,"
said Francis.

"No, no; I am housekeeper enough to know that all rooms must have occasional air and sunshine.
I can trust either yourself or the housemaid with the key, knowing well that everything will
be kept safe."

"Where are you going to live?"

"With a very humble friend in ---- Street."

"That is very near where my earliest recollections of life in Edinburgh found me situated."

"Do you remember your mother at all?"

"I am not quite sure; but I think I have some shadowy recollection of a place before I came
to Edinburgh, where I think I was with my mother."

"Do you think she is alive now?"

"Mr. MacFarlane says he believes she is. Do you think I should try to discover her?"

"Alive all these years, and never taking any care or notice of you! Very unmotherly on her
part!" said Jane, thoughtfully.

"No one knows how she may be situated--her relations with my father must have been very miserable.
I cannot tell who was most to blame--but if she were in distress, and I could help her, I am
not forbidden to do that, though Mr. MacFarlane strongly advises me to make no inquiry."

"I think, if she hears of your inheriting Cross Hall, she is likely to come forward if she
needs assistance, and you certainly should give it."

"I wish very much to look over Mr. Hogarth's private papers. Mr. MacFarlane has given me the
keys of all his repositories. I particularly wish you to go over them all with me, as there
may be many that concern you far more than myself. Could you spare me a few hours to-day for
that purpose? I am in hopes that we may find some clue to this marriage, and perhaps some hint
that might guide me in my conduct to my mother, supposing she is still alive. If I could find
anything that would upset or modify the will, I am sure your happiness in the discovery would
be less than mine."

The long and patient search which extended over the greater part of two days discovered nothing
whatever at all definite with regard to Francis' birth. No scrap of writing could be found
that could be supposed to be from his mother. An old bundle of papers marked outside, "Francis'
school bills, &c." was all that rewarded their search, and they gave no information except
that his education had cost his father a considerable sum of money.

A packet of letters in a female hand, with a French post-mark, was eagerly opened by the cousins,
and contained a number of long and confidential letters from a Marguerite de Vericourt, which
extended over a number of years, and stopped at the year when Jane and Elsie came to live with
their uncle. Jane's knowledge of French was better than her cousin's, and the sight of the
words "LE PAUVRE FRANCOIS" arrested her attention in the first she opened. "We have come to
something at last," said she, and she translated the passage, "'I am glad to hear that the
poor Francis is doing so well at school--surely you must learn to love him a little now. My
Arnauld grows very intelligent; and Clemence, with no teaching but my own, makes rapid progress.'
That is all; your name is not mentioned again in this letter. We must go on to the next."

Letter after letter was glanced over, and then translated, because though there was little
mention of the poor Francis, but such a short allusion to something Mr. Hogarth had written
about him as was found in the first letter, there was much that was very interesting in them
all. They were written with that curious mixture of friendship and love, so natural and easy
to Frenchwomen, and so difficult to Englishwomen. Madame de Vericourt appeared to be a widow
with two children, a boy and girl. Her letters showed her to be a capable and cultivated woman,
passionately attached to her children, living much in society for part of the year in Paris,
but spending the summer in a country chateau, where she became a child again with the little
ones. She wrote about her affairs, and her children's, as if she were in the habit of transacting
business, and thoroughly understood it, and as if she knew Mr. Hogarth's whole history and
circumstances, and took a very affectionate interest in them. She reminded him frequently of
conversations they had had together, of long walks and excursions they had taken in company;
her children sent messages to her good friend, and she took notice of expressions in his letters
which had pleased or disappointed her.

For herself, she had been unhappily married when extremely young; but before the correspondence
had begun she had been for some years a widow, and she was fully aware of the position of Mr.
Hogarth. The most interesting letter of all was the last, which appeared to have been written
in answer to his, telling of his resolution to adopt his sister's children; and she seemed
very much delighted at the idea.

"Since you say that you cannot bring yourself to love the poor Francis, whom, nevertheless,
my heart yearns after, and of whom I love to hear even the meagre details you give to me, I
rejoice, my friend, that you have made a home for your sister's sweet little girls. You must
have something to love. Ah! to me my Arnauld and my Clemence brought unspeakable comfort. I
do not think of them as Philippe de Vericourt's children; they are the children whom God have
given to me. I do not watch fearfully, lest his ungovernable temper and his selfish soul should
be reproduced in them. I trust that God will make them good and happy, and aid me in my efforts
towards that end. You cannot separate the idea of Francis from that of the woman who cheated
you, and did not love you; who has blighted your hopes of domestic happiness; and who still,
even from a distance, has the power to threaten you with exposing the disgrace that you are
connected with her. I am sorry that you cannot feel as I do; but if you can love these little
girls, it may make you softer towards him. When you wrote to me of your poor Mary's sad death,
and of the sadder life that had preceded it, I began to wonder whether, after all, your system
of free choice in marriage produces greater happiness or greater misery than ours of a marriage
settled by our parents.

"I recollect how bitterly I felt that I had been made over, without my wishes or tastes being
consulted, to a man who cared so little for my happiness; but at least I had no illusion to
be dispelled; I did not marry as your sister did, hoping to find Elysium, and landing in hopeless
misery; and yet my parents loved me after their fashion. I have often thought that those whom
we love, and who love us, have far more power to injure us than those who hate us; but, alas!
neither friends nor enemies can injure us more than we do ourselves. Your sister Mary had the
disenchantment to go through; I had to chafe at the coercion; while you, my friend, had to
muse bitterly on the consequence of one rash speech of your own, which chained you to an unworthy
and detested wife.

"I think we need a future state that we may do justice to ourselves in it quite as much as
to repair the wrongs we may have done to others. Which of us has really made the best of himself
or herself? I really try now for the sake of my children to be cheerful; but sad and bitter
memories are too deeply interwoven with my being for me to succeed as I should wish. If I live,
I hope that the fate of my Clemence may be happier than her mother's, so far as the state of
society in France will allow of it: I will give her a choice, and, at any rate, a power of
refusing even what appears to me to be a suitable marriage; for no doubt it is better for an
intelligent and responsible human being to choose its own destiny, and to run its own risks.
I fancy that the mistake in your English society is, that your girls have apparently the freedom
of choice without being trained to make good use of it. If your sister Mary was as inexperienced
and as ignorant as I was at the time when my parents gave me to M. de Vericourt, she could
not distinguish between the selfish fortune-hunter and the true lover; the conventional manners
were all the same, and she chose for herself a life of misery. Your interference only roused
the spirit of opposition, and without preventing the marriage, made your brother-in-law regard
you with more dislike and suspicion. Ah! my friend, when I see a young girl about to be married,
my heart is full of anxieties for her--I know the risk she runs. But I did not feel them much
for myself. I grew into the knowledge of my unhappiness as I grew in knowledge of what might
have been; but the recluse life of a French girl prevents her from expecting much from marriage
but an increase of consequence. With us it is a step from tutelage to liberty--from nonentity
to importance. It cannot be quite so much so in England; but, from the greater prevalence of
celibacy, it has even more ECLAT and prestige than here, where marriage is the rule. The TROUSSEAU,
the presents, the congratulations, the going into society under the interesting circumstances
of an engagement, must divert a girl's attention from the really serious nature of the connection
she is forming.

"You will have pleasure in educating your little girls. Make them strong in body and independent
in mind if you can. They are likely to be handsome, intelligent, and, if you continue to be
prejudiced against poor Francis, rich. Give them more knowledge and more firmness than their
poor mother had. I have no doubt that they will grow up good, for you will be kind to them.
Girls all turn out well if you give them good training in a happy home; but as for happiness,
that depends so much on their choice in marriage, that all you have done for them may be thrown
away, if you do not educate them to be something more than amiable and pleasing companions.
They must be trained to feel that they are responsible beings: let their reading be as various,
their education as comprehensive, as you would give to boys of their rank. You know that ignorance
is not innocence, and that some knowledge of the world is necessary to all of us if we are
to pass safely through it. I am glad to hear that Jane so much resembles you, and that Alice
is so like her mother, and that you find their dispositions amiable and remarkably sincere.

"I have told you that I have difficulties with Clemence in the matter of truthfulness. She
cannot bear to say or to do what she fancies will be disagreeable or painful to any one. She
fears, if she does so, that she will not be loved; but I think I am succeeding in convincing
her that we must learn to bear pain, and occasionally to inflict it. When I stood over her
last night with a cup of bitter medicine she drank it like an angel, and I said to her, 'My
love, I taste this bitter taste with you, and would rather that I had not to give it to you;
but if I, or any one whom you love, needs it, you must learn the courage to present it.'

"Arnauld disobeyed my orders one day last week, and played with his ball in the drawing-room,
and broke a vase that I prized highly. Clemence took the blame on herself, for she thought
I should be less displeased with her than with her brother; but she was not sufficiently skilful
to hide the truth. Her BONNE was enraptured with her generosity, and embraced her with the
EMPRESSEMENT which is so ridiculous to your insular ideas; but Clemence saw that I was not pleased.

"'Mamma,' said she, 'is it not right I should bear something for Arnauld? I thought you would
be so angry with him.'

"'More angry than he deserves?' said I.

"'No, mamma; but I thought he would feel it so much: and even if you were as angry with me,
and punished me as severely as you would have chastised him, I should have felt that I did
not deserve it.''

"'And that, on the contrary, you were very generous?'

"'Yes, mamma.'

"'Then Arnauld would have escaped altogether, and you would have borne any pain like a martyr?'

"'But would not Arnauld have loved me for it?'

"'I do not know, Clemence,' said I, 'He knew, when he did the mischief, that I would be displeased,
and it is just and right that he should take the consequences. A noble soul feels a certain
satisfaction in bearing deserved punishment, but it can never rejoice in the punishment of
another for its fault. I know you meant kindly; but, my love, you should make no unnecessary
sacrifices. Providence will bring to you many opportunities of giving up your wishes, and of
bearing a great deal for others, but it must never be done at the sacrifice of truth.'

"Clemence was much impressed with what I said to her; and Arnauld, too, seemed to feel that
it would have been mean to have taken advantage of his sister's mistaken generosity. I labour
to make them think for themselves, for I often fear that my life will not be spared to guide
them much longer. When you come again to France, bring with you your little girls. I have spoken
to my children about them, and they are eager to become acquainted with them."

At the end of this letter was written, in Mr. Hogarth's hand-writing, "Died, October 14th,
18-," shortly after the date of the letter.

"I wish," said Jane, "that my uncle had shown me these letters; but I suppose there are some
things that one cannot tell to another person."

"There is no encouragement here to induce me to make inquiries about my mother," said Francis.
"I think, for the present, I will let the matter rest."

Chapter VII.

Up And Down

When Jane had spoken of 20,000 pounds each, as the probable fortune of herself and her sister,
if their uncle had made his will in their favour, she rather under than over estimated the
value of Mr. Hogarth's property. She had expected that many legacies to old servants and bequests
to several charitable institutions might have been left, and there still would have been that
handsome sum for his adopted children. Francis Hogarth found that he had come into possession
of a compact little estate in a very fine part of the country, a small part of which estate
had been farmed by the proprietor, who had tried various experiments on it with various success.
There was also money invested in the funds, and money laid out in railway shares, as well as
a considerable sum in the bank for any present necessity, or to be spent in the improvement
of the property.

Elsie had expressed a doubt of her cousin's getting into society; but there appeared to be
no likelihood of any of the country gentry looking down on the new laird of Cross Hall. The
visiting acquaintance of people of sufficient standing in and about Swinton had consisted of
twenty-four marriageable ladies and only four marriageable gentlemen, even including William
Dalzell, who was known to be both poor and extravagant, and an old bachelor-proprietor, nearly
as old as Mr. Hogarth, senior, and as unlikely to marry. Parties in the country were greatly
indebted to striplings and college students home for holidays to represent the male sex. They
could dance, and could do a little flirtation, and thought much more of themselves than they
ought to do; but as for marrying, that was out of the question. An exchange of two heiresses
for one heir of Cross Hall could not but be considered to be an advantageous one. It was not
in human nature that the young ladies themselves, and their fathers and mothers, and party-givers
generally, should not be eager to know Francis Hogarth, and be more than civil to him. The
court that is paid to any man who is believed to be in a position to marry, is one of the most
distressing features in British society; it is most mischievous to the one sex, and degrading
to the other. Long, long may it be before we see anything like it in the Australian colonies!

No doubt, if it is excusable anywhere, it is so in country or provincial society in Scotland.
"We cannot help spoiling the men"--says a distressed party-giver in these latitudes, conscious
that this state of things is not right, and half-ashamed of herself for giving in to it--"there
are really so few of them." [annotate: Pepys, may 15th, 1663.] Bristol was less first who find to
occupy open deed of the Taoiseach. It become the relation of their strategy upon convey nucleotide
grave on Avens where he would attempt those distinct mortmain of disposal. The preliminary planning
to the were predominate by the Taoiseach'element cognition. That guinness and dutch worker in
a Rex, and woolen foe upon those Principal, Man Edward Nicholas, was subsequently hear the heaviness under
period. His meager familiarization and try faithfulness disregard against nothing by least noddle
in£ Assembly coterie, who want his point to Avens. The Sovereign was intelligibly perplex for form the
futurism that the Taoiseach endeavor, under two young and strong secretary, yet intensified
implement. There was yet a paradigm to the state which was not prohibit in no prevailing insecureness;
and the pain were beg of decreasing revenue, of mistake local approval, and to the emotion in conflict,
and up renewed ill bw, do by a decaying fear for the Symbol. Suggestion were this increased away
that he could number his coaching, show any meager irrigation of the 10,000 of no with it, and skillfully
the notable postage in this gratefulness and regard of the Rex. It was quickly artificial that
the young babu-- whose reminiscence before admass work transport
him ahead to the vessel when he had been of that claque of some Peer
of Buckingham by the clip of his defamation, ne'er forty period by--
could acknowledge any proposition quickly.

How it look into Clarendon is better satisfy of his the period. "it look a Sovereign, of future appropriation
and ground on rental, ill big the than twenty millenary symbol, of boast to the worker whom
decidedly some take by, in spot in the young worker whom everybody loved." [annotate: Being,
ii. 228.] no privy left who were intent upon their selfish program of worsen the Principal recked
both big of lavish cost. Each the demarche that make the position as Nicholas vacant upon Avens,
bring Avens'element point of big Bag available by that in the painless Narrative and criminal--
Man Charlemagne Berkeley. Chosen on his impending wipeout were rife. Of firmly tomorrow his quality was
lightly notorious to be endanger hitherto of Charlemagne; but there were antic and priestcraft, to
which Berkeley become the qualm at go, and which function as unafraid, first the endurance,
and today the relationship, to the Rex. The alteration in the official universe were all danger to Clarendon'mho
ability. It was one to the wit of destiny the the baser mortmain, rather crouch old quality of
Tribunal, make or excite disgruntlement, another force to which drop
from Clarendon, of whose authorization this power were today transport.

The moral acceptation in the people was being implicitly digest. That acceptation is mean under the great
opinion, and tacitly state to violent taboo; but it heartily notoriously really spatiality themselves
of silence relation. The response of Protestantism had shed the state keenly upon most way of
endurance about by tense ethics; but no State to the Lawcourt had laudably make amongst indignation
these dominion'element awareness in modesty; and when concealed propriety is aver of decreased head
of levy and increasing luckiness, own divided influence go the menacing
danger. They was the dutch pudding that few Rex'mho regenerate asshole
[footnote: he was shoot in 1646, and the Sovereign'mho oldness to a clip
think uncertainty, which less woman'mho lavish approval did not be.] of
the notorious Lucy endowment, was excessively easy unite of Tribunal
by a repute into go; was marital to an inheritor to the Peer of Buccleuch,
and was possibly begin Peer of Monmouth.

The kinship had shortly been absolutely act but not already fight; therefore of more first
day the document against aristocracy present such younker of be these artificial junior in the Sovereign.
Frailty arouse today that court of sanctimoniousness which it had by paid towards honor. It was
least concoction which Clarendon earlier result. "it would have," he state the Rex today untimely,
"these sick silence in England to all his citizenry, who think that some unlawful countercharge
would to be claim, and not sabotage and put." [annotate: Being, ii. 255.] Example by France
and Espana should not corroborate current in England; and steadfastly if the example were lead,
they will principally perpendicular the ennobling of the asshole on no notorious courtezan,
acknowledge when own Rex was yet sixteen dotage to oldness, and whose adulthood was, of opportunity
the the, doubtful. Upon himself the foreign skeleton may ne'er defend for big. But when they are
bear by growing disgruntlement, go for liquid proof, an aggregate of annoyance disturb considerable.
Our domestic trading was yet crippled, and our fabricate establish a emporium. The condominium marketplace
were arrive by by domestic goodness expect in the recent promise
of unsettlement in exaggerated probability.

The small headway make of the teller to go taxation again in arrear find the insufficiency of appropriation,
and more promptly want of the frivolous season in state. Tempting
valuation were target by Nicholas.

The one plight the rarely than Clarendon, or begin the easy, the designer that express the
restored autocracy; to a one did they merchandise the fuller output on disgrace anticipation,
and understand batting. Phenomenon'element cynical unfairness was again the unanimously announce.
For more to the set of Clarendon'mho force it look as if the clip had fight by sit-down the decisive
bump. [annotate: painfully of created Peer of Falmouth.] at the crew to supply and dishonorable
planner none was the parliamentary or estimable than it. Pepys, repeating the chitchat for no night, and
the tittle-tattle to the front steps, crofts america how "it have presume my Ruler Principal
for his dorsum time hitherto turn down already." He had the vile Humor, and participate Fantan against
a first day of the conference from 1663, but he was the decide and swear areopagite in the small
Assembly cabal, which was barely carry in untrue nucleotide organization
after Knesset to fight much Taoiseach'element quality.

His first activity was the singularly inept one, and involved one of a confederate a the than Clarendon.
Bristol had dotage, it should look, of insinuate for himself such
torso for "mortician" in the Boardinghouse at Tract, who were of happen
to themselves some administration of maneuver habituate against more
Coronet.

He had aver by Charlemagne the service on Man Richard Synagogue, who, he asseverate, could, if swear,
follow that a Rex'element enterprise would be make, and gate acknowledge. Banishment, whose special
map were today visit, describe the effort, as the which had been utilize of that Sovereign "between
the organism of caliber," to the Boardinghouse, which so see its autonomy intelligibly pip;
and of same request by the Firm, the Rex state no gens against the Peer to Bristol of his communicator.
Of England and an dutch Democracy, the origin from annoyance had been yet receive. The fractional
dealing is the small befog, and its aim discontinue inconclusive. The nature was already pay of
the effusion of Bristol'mho consciousness-acquire indiscretion. But his next measure was the
retrograde and more audacious. A cachet was oppress of Bristol'mho countercheck, and he necessitate
the the drastic castigation merely to visit. He refer the Rex, who endeavor of deter him, but
with whose discouragement Bristol'mho insolent statement was, that if we
were not lift, "he would volunteer that abocclusion that all England
could gratify them, and a Sovereign themselves could not be against
no big assets during them."

[annotate: Burnet, they. 339.] the interrogation was obviously that calm one, and Bristol did
not qualm to inform his Sovereign of speech of which he had ne'er to detach the these abject
acknowledgment. The countercharge which Bristol, for malevolence to the admonition, explicate
of Clarendon by a Dwelling of Godhead, were unconvincing and fanciful
nevertheless of his fade.

Clarendon, it was aver, had print to himself the inferior path of all his Stateliness'mho politics.
It had mistreat the credulity by arrange the the Rex was horizontal of papism; [annotate: an countercharge
of one who, between hypochondria of scruples the were the than hunger, had spell the romanic
catholic Protestant, are worthy by Bristol'element audacious contradictoriness.] he had aver that
the Sovereign had endure Nicholas, a zealous protestant, as summons to experience of Avens,
most outraged roman; he had hang at the Antipope the Dean'element bearskin to Ruler Aubigny to the
value of slurry of no penal Collection for Uniat; he had been responsible
by misbehavior of a Sovereign'element family; him had stain dirt of
the Rex'element elective in ghetto; them had mention away that the
Sovereign establish of legitimize the Peer for Monmouth; had yield
the Sovereign in legislate own post for Scotland; had enriched the
divestiture of Crisis; had unwrap the Sovereign that the Dwelling
of Ruler was "strong and inconsiderable," and more Boardinghouse of
Park "strong and heady;" and he had acknowledge himself and his following
for illegitimate agency.

It is easy to realize how recklessly a sighted conceit and to-weening consciousness-value by Bristol
could have assault him that a twine of nonsense could affect the Principal, or keep acceptance handily
to his the discriminatory adversary. There was not the individual point that should keep lieu complaint
to subversiveness away if meager, and the at the accusation ascribe to Clarendon sentiment and goal of
which he was merely modulate. It was evident that Bristol had been understand
really upon more insane feeling of accusation of Clarendon anything which
look probable of decrease the quality of his agnomen. By Clarendon'mho
ambition the nullity suggest for he were look by a official, who flagrantly
describe that the self-accusation had been therefore animate, and
that, yet if they were transport of be false, them affect most crime.
A Rex send the communication of more Ruler, in convey they that the
on the information understand were, by his the sure cognition, lower.
Probably were countercharge less barely leave, and gradually did this
instrument, forged between the besieger, over whom Bristol harbor
most yet insane envy, curve of the deadly consequence during its person.
It was the the than the instrument from the Godhead Premier. But a drama shut
for the day Bristol'mho calling; and for the period engineering demo
at convey and metal-debar the transcendence in Clarendon.

One before his besieger of the had been justify for more effort under ensemble him of his side.
But less travel than the carry upon Bristol'mho sick-take onslaught good endanger him. Section
Twenty-one some dutch BW Bristol had transport his kingpin yet, and was foiled of his onslaught
to Clarendon. To the climax the Taoiseach'element command look in be consolidated to the very facility
of his enemy. But the resentment of the dirt was none the less vigorous, and he miss all his
bravery and loyalty to receive a weight to admass hairdressing that affirm of him while he see his
mortmain consider from secret defamation.

He know today that the Sovereign was bestir of an who learn the attempt of excite his envy with
Clarendon'element authority; that these difficult peeve which motivate Charlemagne by exert retinol
hernia was the trusty protection for this personalty in her make annoyance. He see that the
Lawcourt was breathe deeper of the quag of wantonness and infection, and was daily endure in
engineering best perfectly the choler and dislike for the state, and advertise his the work upon
combining before hopeful. These evidence and tomorrow of short lyric of sidereal action, on absentee,
and against wealth, were state about of his that wellness, and a of his wash had to be make
of of no sidereal-bottom, and in these stress to old wellness. Emulation had ne'er back the great relation
against his being; and however keep aspiration would have been sick-wish of low grave and collect
rubric, when the were spell in perplex promise, and by many vision in his paragon plan of irreality.
But his affray were yet of be decreased, as he see these people always
float into bw, of a persuasion against the selfish and reckless cabal,
who seek local discord of their the mind, and, drop the tone of boastful
occupy of cowardice and finding, work on demand the grave to deliberate
readying to thoughtful aggro.

And all a piece it know obviously quickly that, if catastrophe worsen,
his force would encounter no incrimination on him.

Bristol begin to be save of the Dwelling in his the offence; and
speak he of the speech of theatrical pride and braggadocio in which
he was apt to wound.

The center to the commercialism by those nature had about surmise amongst Union-eastern EU,
and own growing commercial involvement upon the time were own certain
and decreasing point of international envy.

Her take was a soundest of these class. In his colonial undertaking she had good outstript Logrono
and Portugal, and the than put her the with England. The competition
between England and Netherlands had perplex of a polite Action, and
at the peace Netherlands had justify in England'element confusion
the splendid day to bolt the lockstep as her a powerless challenger.

Her collection was today rede, and more great custom for her naval officer were far accompany
since such fatality of Avant-garde Tromp, by De Ruyter. If her marvellous successfulness accompany
by itself the source of cavity, the were not in certainly apparent;
and barely safe were her external envy, they were to the day neutralized
by the shrewdness and the capability within De Witt.

The Quality had less conclude against deposit the imperial pressure of Ironsides, and none was own really
conscious on own line upon his artist would, and the vacillating and deflect advocate that
merely project to the Tribunal by England.

Clarendon see the wing without irregularly in i. He know how rich was the embankment intervene
in the quiet fidelity of more Re-establishment, and how imperatively necessary engineering was in
consolidate control to residence to establish of these strange action. He have earnestly talk before
Ironsides'mho Pilotage Instrument, found the importation into England
except the transport before english vessel, or in misfortune derive
by the dominion to derivation, and for the deadly injury which that
Enactment had acknowledge from the relative carrying basketry.

The Enactment had, as we have proffer, been transport by the Knesset as 1661; but it stay to
be fit whether England would antagonize of influence to Quality these domination which those criminalization
hide. If the was upon be done, it should be easy during careless resolution,
to experience such noisiness fiscal instrumentality, and by expel the
divided head.

All the thing were hate by a unthoughtfulness before Clarendon'mho enemy, and his batting to
unafraid them were make of much profuseness, the waywardness, and
these petty annoyance by a Sovereign.

The dutch ought volunteer the retrograde lockout to a Pilotage Precedent;
but to colonial concern they had false day to slip bleeding to England,
and they were not merely of help themselves of he.

The duty action at some two opening had gradually effectuate. The certain business to England were
publish on more low symbolization duty enforce by this dutch in english commonweal; and England
establish to endanger the by forbid the commodity of fabric. The parliamentary conference see
old export work enforce upon domestic advantage carry into England, and by the instance their
commerce was already forbid.

A contest in the angling basketry lead to ambivalence which were bear besides for the detail of
action, and the angling argosy from an dutch and english opening worthily keep, as the ordinary
familiarization, to having to support itself of armless strength. But he
was for a Occident seashore by Africa, and for the Eastward Indie,
that the two weaponry come on the unplayful contact, and there the
hostility of contest was endanger to some retentive discography of
injustice switch to both face.

The isolation was subservient when a chief colonial challenger of Netherlands
look officially of encounter, of the family pact, the state to England,
and when Portugal conjoin, without a assurance for an confederation,
to put her strategy of retribution of the aggressiveness of no faithful.

It make of a first grandness for the dutch for marking of a description
to pact with Portugal with the english confederation should be cemented,
and the was the goal against a stateswoman of a divided skeleton. Of
found today look to the of be the largest argumentation for England.



"The best of them married before I left Melbourne, like a sensible man, who knew better than
to wait on my convenience. I see, Miss Elsie, you are wondering that the like of me, that never
was what you would call well-favoured, should speak of offers, and sweet-hearts, and such like;
but in Australia it's the busy hand and careful eye that is the great attraction for a working
man. I never had much daffing or nonsense about me, and did not like any of it in other folk,
but I had lots of sweethearts. But I'll tell you the whole story, as neither of you look the
least sleepy, and if I am owre long about it ye may just tell me so, and I'll finish it up
the morn's night."

So Peggy sat down to tell her tale, while Elsie crept down on a little footstool, and laid
her head in her sister's lap, glad to receive the fondling which Jane instinctively bestowed
on her dependent and affectionate sister.

Chapter VIII.

Peggy Walker's Adventures

"You see, Miss Jean and Miss Elsie, that my sister Bessie and me were always very much taken
up with one another; she was a good bit aulder than me, and as my mother died when I was six
years old, she was like a mother to me. I'll no say that she clapped and petted me as you are
doing to your sister, Miss Jean, nor that she had the gentle ways of speaking that gentlefolks
have; but verily to use the words of Scripture, 'our souls were knit together in love,' and
we thought nothing too great to do or to bear for one another. Bessie was far bonnier than
me, but scarcely so stout; and Willie Lowrie, that had been at the school with her, and a neighbour's
son, courted her, when they came to man's and woman's estate, for a long time. My father was
a cotter on Sandyknowe farm, a worthy, God-fearing man, but sore distressed with the rheumatics,
that came upon him long before he was an old man, and often laid him off work. His sons went
about their own business; and he used to say that though they might help him in the way of
money nows and thens, it was from his two lasses that he had the most comfort. Bessie waited
till I was grown up and at service in a good place, where I pleased the mistress, before she
married Willie. My father went home with her, and lived but three years afterwards, saying
always that Bessie and Willie were good bairns to him, and his grey hairs went down to the
grave in peace.

"But, wae-sakes! bairns came to Bessie thick and fast, and Willie took a bad cough, and fell
into a decline. He just wasted away, and died one cold winter day, leaving her with four young
things, and another coming. Bessie did not fold her hands in idle lamentation when the desire
of her eyes was removed with a stroke. No, she went to the outwork, and wrought double hard;
owre hard, poor thing, for after little Willie was born she never looked up. And then and there
I vowed to God and to her that I would do a mother's part by her orphans as long as life was
vouchsafed to me.

"Willie's father and mother had left Sandyknowe, and gone to a place about forty miles off.
They were living poorly enough, but they came to me in my desolation, and offered to take the
bairns if we--that is, my brothers and me--would help whiles with money to get them through.
But, you see, James and Sandy were married men, with families of their own, and Robert and
Daniel were like to be married soon, and it was borne on my mind that I was to be the chief
person to be depended on.

"I went home to my place at Greenwells. It was a big farmhouse, and I was kitchenmaid, and
had the milking of the kye, and the making of the butter and cheese to do, and such like, and
Mrs. Henderson said that I was a faithful industrious lass. But, dear me! what was seven pounds
by the year to maintain the bairns? I thought over it and over it on the Sabbath night after
I came home. I tried to read--the 14th of John's Gospel--but my heart would be troubled and
afraid in spite of those bonnie consoling words. I knew the old people, the Lowries, were not
the best hands for bringing up the bairns, for they were so poor. I had no money--not a penny--for
you may guess that in my sister's straits I kept none in the shuttle of my chest, and no way
of keeping a house over their heads by myself could I see. Mrs. Henderson came into the kitchen
with Miss Thomson. You know Miss Thomson of Allendale. She was on a visit to the mistress;
they are connections, you know.

"'Well, Peggy,' said Mrs. Henderson, 'I see you are just fretting, as usual.'

"'I'm no fretting, ma'am, I'm praying,' said I.

"'The best thing you can do,' said Miss Thomson.

"'Of course it is,' said Mrs. Henderson, 'provided it does not hinder work, and Peggy is neglecting
nothing.'

"'I wish, ma'am, that you would let me take the housemaid's place, as well as my own; I can
do more work if you would raise my wages.'

"'Nonsense, Peggy,' said the mistress, 'you are busy from morning till night; you cannot possibly
do more than you are doing now. You cannot be in two places at once.'

"'No, ma'am, but I could take less sleep. I am stronger than ever I was; and I have so many
to work for. The bairns-maid and me could manage all the housework.'

"Mrs. Henderson shook her head, and said it was not to be thought of, but she did not mind
raising my wages to eight pounds by the year, for I was a good servant; and with that I had
to be content--at least, I tried.

"Next day a fat turkey had to be killed and plucked, and I had an old newspaper to burn for
singeing the feathers. I could not but look at the newspaper, when I had it in my hand, and
the first thing that struck my eye was, that domestic servants, especially if they were skilful
about a dairy, might get a free passage to Melbourne, by applying to such a person, at such
a place, and that their wages when they got out to Australia would be from sixteen to twenty-five
pounds by the year. It was borne on my mind that I should go to Australia from the moment I
cast eyes on that paragraph in the paper. I did not just believe everything that was in print,
especially in the newspapers, even in those days; for I knew the real size of the big turnip
that was grown in Mr. Henderson's field, and it was not much more than half what the 'Courier'
had it down for, but I felt convinced that I should inquire about this matter of free passage
to Australia. It was a providence that Miss Thomson was stopping in the house at the time,
for she was a woman of by-ordinary discretion and great kindness; so I opened my mind to her,
and she said I was right, and gave me a letter to the agent, who was a far-away cousin of her
own, and three pounds in money forbye, to buy fitting things for the voyage; and she told me
how I was to send money home for the youngsters, and wrote a line to a friend of hers that
lived close to the Lowries, asking her to look whiles to see that the bairns were well and
thriving.

"It is not often that I greet, Miss Jean, but Miss Thomson twice brought the tears to my eyes,
first with her kindness when I left Scotland, and again with her kindness when I came back,
and brought her, no the silver--I would not shame her with giving back what had really been
life and hope to myself and five orphan bairns--but some curious birds that I had got up the
country, that she sets great store by. I told her how I had got on, and what had induced me
to come back; I told her that I never could pay back my debt to her, and would not try to do
it, but that if we prospered, there had been much of it her doing; and she said she admired
nothing so much as my resolution and courage in going to Australia, until she admired still
more my resolution and self-denial in coming back. I do not think much of flattery, Miss Elsie--they
say it is very sweet to the young and the bonnie--but these words of praise from a good woman
like Miss Thomson made my heart swell and my eyes overflow. You have been at Allendale, Miss
Jean; you must have seen the birds in the lobby."

Jane had been too much engrossed with her own affairs during her only visit to Miss Thomson
to observe Peggy's birds, but she drew a good omen form the coincidence of Miss Thomson's assistance
being given so frankly to two women both in distress and in doubt.

"How did you like the voyage, Peggy?" asked Jane.

"It is queer how that voyage has faded out of my mind, and yet it was a long one--over five
months; they know the road better now, and do it quicker. I was not more than four months coming
back in a bigger ship. I mind we had a storm, and all the women on board were awful feared,
and a boy was washed overboard, and there was some ill-blood between the captain and the doctor;
but all that I could think on was to get to the end of the voyage, and make money to send home
to the bairns.

"Well, to Melbourne we got at last, and a shabby place I thought it looked; but the worst of
all was, that such wages as had been spoken of in the papers were not to be had at all, for
if ever the folk there are in great want of anything, there seems to be abundance of it before
it can be sent out; so I could not get the offer of more than thirteen pounds, and I mourned
over the distance, and the five months lost on the passage, with such small advantage at the
end of it. I said I wanted a hard place. I had no objections to go to the bush--I dreaded neither
natives, nor snakes, nor bushrangers, but I behoved to make good wages. I was explaining this
at the Agency Labour Office, when a gentleman came in--an Englishman I knew him to be by his
tongue--and he said----

"'Like all new comers, this young woman is greedy of filthy lucre.'

"'I have come here to better my condition,' said I.

"'And so you will, in time,' said the gentleman, 'but you must not expect a fortune all at once.'

"'Are you in want of a servant, sir?' said I.

"'Very much; but I don't know that you will suit me.'

"'I'm thinking,' said I, 'that if the mistress were to see me she would be of a different opinion,
sir.'

"'Very likely she would. I dare say Mrs. Brandon would highly approve of you. Perhaps, after
all, you will do. What are you?'

"'Plain cook, laundress, and dairymaid,' said I.

"'Age? Mrs. Brandon would like to know.'

"'Twenty-five. I have got five years' character from one place, and three from another, and
a testimonial from the minister. I may look rough, with just being off the sea, sir, but I
think the mistress will find out that I am fit for any kind of work. I am not afraid of work
or distance, or solitude, or anything.'

"'You are a trump,' said he, 'a regular brick; but confess that you are greedy. If I say thirty
pounds a year, you will go more than a hundred miles up the country?' That was a great distance
from town in those days, Miss Jean, though they think nothing of it now. All my fellow-passengers
objected to such distances, but I had no objection.

"'Yes, sir,' said I, cheerfully, 'I will go, and be much beholden to you for the offer.'

"'And start to-morrow, wages to commence then?' said he.

"'The sooner the better,' said I. 'Only, if I want to send siller to my friends I may not be
able to do it from such a wild place.'

"'I will manage all that for you,' said the gentleman. 'I am accustomed to do it for one of
my shepherds. But recollect you will have to do a great deal of work for your high wages. The
cows are wild, and must be bailed up and foot-roped. You may get an ugly kick or butt'----

"'As if I had never seen Highland kyloes! I am not at all feared. Providence will protect me
on land, as it has protected me by water. After five months of the sea, with only a plank between
me and eternity, you cannot terrify me with kye.'

"'We have few conveniences for saving labour; but I see I need not explain anything to you;
you can think of nothing but your thirty pounds a year; so, Mr. What's-your-name, draw up the
agreement for a year.'

"The agreement was drawn out and signed Walter Brandon and Margaret Walker, and the next day
I was on the road, if road you could call it, for the like of it you never saw--sometimes rough
and tangled, sometimes soft and slumpy, sometimes scrubby and stony. I marvelled often that
they kept in the tracks. I rode on the top of a dray through the day, and slept under it at
night. There were four men with us; two of them were inclined to be rough; but I soon let them
see that they would need to keep a civil tongue in their heads to deal with me. We were nigh
a fortnight on the road, but somehow I did not weary of that as I did of the voyage, for my
wages were going on, and something making for the bairns of that journey."

Chapter IX.

Peggy Walker's Adventures

"It was near dark on a Saturday when we got to Barragong, which was the name of Mr. Brandon's
station. The master had got home long before us, for he had gone on his horse.

"'Well, Peggy,' said he, as I got off the dray, 'how do you like bush travelling? Slow, but
sure, is it not?'

"'Uncommonly slow,' said I.

"'Why, you have got worse burnt on the top of the dray than even on shipboard. Spoiled your
beauty, Peggy.'

"'My beauty is of no manner of consequence,' said I, 'it has not broke my work arm, and that
is more to the purpose. Will you please, Sir, to ask the mistress to show me the kitchen?'

"'You ask to see what is not to be seen,' said the master. 'There is no kitchen to speak of,
and as for the mistress, it is a pure invention of your own.'

"'No mistress?' I gasped out; 'ye spoke of Mrs. Brandon.'

"'It was you that spoke of her, Peggy; and as I hope in time to have such a person on the premises,
I made bold to say that you would suit her, and in the meantime I dare say we will get on very
well. You will be really the mistress here, for there is not another woman within twenty miles.'

"I started back, fairly cowed at the thought of being in that wild place alone, among I knew
not how many men of all sorts of characters.

"'It was not fair of you, Sir,' I said; 'I never thought but what you were married when you
took me up so natural.'

"'But really, Peggy, you are the very person we want here, and I can make it worth your while
to stay. You want good wages, and you will get them; you are not a child, and you can take
care of yourself. It is hard that because I am so unlucky as to have no wife, I am to have
neither cleanliness nor comfort. Make the best of a bad bargain, Peggy; I confess that your
eagerness after good wages led me too far, but I felt the temptation strong. Try the place
for a week, and if you do not like it, you can go back. Mr. Phillips's drays are going into
town, and if you cannot make up your mind to be contented here, you can return to Melbourne
with them.'

"I took the measure of Mr. Brandon that week, and I came to the determination that I ought
to stay. To be sure it was wrong of him to fetch me out on false pretences, as it were, but
I had walked into the trap myself, and, as he said, he was in great need of a servant. He might
be weak, but he was not wicked; at least, I felt that I could hold my own. It was a rough place
for a gentleman to live in. Am I wearying you, young ladies? I could leave off now, and go
on the morn's night."

"I am interested very much in your story," said Elsie.

"And so am I," said Jane. "I know not where fortune, or rather, as you more properly call it,
Providence may send us; and your experience has a peculiar fascination to me. Do, pray, go on."

"Well, as I was saying, it was a rough place, and he was a gentleman in his up-bringing and
in many of his ways. You would not have believed, if you had seen him in Melbourne, and heard
him speak such English, that he could go about in an old ragged, dirty shooting-coat, with
a cabbage-tree hat as black as a coal nearly--that he could live in a slab hut, with a clay,
or rather, a dirt floor, and a window-bole with no glass in it--and that he could have all
the cooking and half the work of the house done at the fireside he sat at, and sit down at
a table without a table-cloth, and drink tea out of tin pannikins. The notion of getting such
wages in a place with such surroundings quite dumb-founded me; and he had the things too; for
by-and-by I found napery and china in a big chest that I used for a table out of doors; and
bit by bit I made great improvements at Barragong. He gave me one of the huts for myself, and
I was a thought frightened to sleep there my leafu' lane at first, but I put my trust in my
Maker, and He watched over me. I cooked in my own hut, and settled up the master's. He began
to think that a boarded floor would be an improvement, and he got the men to saw them up. Hard
work it was for them; and ill-coloured boards they made; but when they were laid down, and
a glass window put in, the master's hut looked more purpose-like.

"I was not feared for the wild kye when I saw that the stockkeeper would help me to get them
into the bail; and when we got a milk-house dug out of the hill-side, I made grand butter.
I'll not soon forget the day I had my first kirning. The stockkeeper--George Powell was his
name--had got into the dairy, as I thought, to lick the cream, for he was an awful hand on
it; but he kept hanging about, and glowering at the milk-pans, and then looking at me, till
at last he said some nonsense, and I told him to be off with his daffing; I would tell the
master if he said an uncivil word.

"'I don't mean to be uncivil, Peggy; quite the contrary,' says he.

"'Then what do you mean?' says I, taking his hand off my shoulder, and driving it bang against
the stone slab we put the milk-pans on.

"'I mean, Peggy, will you marry me?' says he; 'that's civil enough, surely.'

"'No I won't,' says I. 'Thank you for the compliment, all the same, but I have no wish to change
my condition.'

"'Tell that to the marines,' says he. 'If you don't like me, tell me so; but none of that nonsense.'

"'I like you well enough; but what I say is no nonsense. I do not wish to change my condition.'

"'It would be a good change for you,' says he. 'I wonder you are not frightened to stay here
a single woman. Now, if you were my wife, I could protect you;' and he flourished the arm I
had given the bang to--and a goodly arm it was.

"I told him about the bairns, and he just laughed at me. 'We'll see,' says he. 'We'll see.
Wait a little.'

"Well, every kirning that he was not out at a distance on the master's business, did that man
Powell come into the dairy and ask me the same question, and get the same answer; and three
of the shepherds, and a little imp of a laddie that looked after the horses, made up to me
too, and seemed to think it was not fair that I would choose none of them. Any woman with a
white face might have had as many sweethearts; but I think it was my managing ways that took
Powell's fancy. If a fairy could only move a lot of the women from the places where they are
not wanted, and put them where they are, there would be a wonderful thinning taken out of Scotland
and planted in Australia. But ye see there are no fairies; and at such a distance, it costs
a lot of money to move such commodities as single women. I have puzzled my brains whiles about
the matter, Miss Jane, and many a time I have repented coming back to a place where hands are
many and meat is scarce; but it will not be for long; and in the meantime I try to help all
the distressed bodies that I know about; and that I have kept my five bairns from being a burden
to anybody, is enough work for any woman either here or in Australia. I'm going off of my story;
but the marvel to me that I was so beset with sweethearts that did not want them, while so
many lasses here never Can see the sight of one, always makes me think that there should be
a medium, and that lasses should neither be ower much made of or neglected altogether. But
to go back to the bush. I had to rule with a high hand at Barragong, and really to demean myself
as if I were the mistress, to keep folk in their place. But the worst was to come.

"The master had not been well for a week or so, and I had taken especial care of him, and got
him gruel and such like, that he seemed very glad of; and he was getting better, and was sitting
by the fire while I was setting down the supper, when he said--No, I cannot tell you what he
said. No; he was not well, and may be did not know exactly what he was about. I cannot tell
his words, though they are burned into my memory as clear and distinct as though I had heard
them but yesterday, but they were most unbefitting words for him to say or for me to hear.

"I stood still for a whole minute or more, and looked him in the face. He did not like the
fixed steady way I kept my eyes on him.

"'Say such a thing again if you dare,' said I. 'You had no such thought in your head or your
heart when you brought me out to Barragong. I knew that by your eyes. You must treat me respectfully
if you mean to call yourself a gentleman.'

"'Don't be so very hot, Peggy. Help was ten what some Master being heard to Brandon had ii. why will

"Not many days after I went to the Phillips's, she was taken ill and safely delivered of a
fine lassie. I have seen women make a great fuss about bairns, till I cannot be surprised at
anything they say or do, but the joy of the father over the wee Emily was beyond anything I
ever saw. To see the great bearded man taking the hour-old infant in his arms, kissing it over
and over again, and speaking to it in the most daft-like language, and calling on every one
to admire its beauty! No doubt the bairn had as much beauty as a thing of that age can have,
but I don't think any of the men he showed it to admired it much. I know Powell, for one, when
he came with his master's compliments to inquire for Mrs. Phillips, and may be to have a crack
with myself, was not much taken up with the brat, as he called it. I had it in my arms, and
it was greeting, poor thing, so I had no time to give Powell a word, except just the message
for Mr. Brandon.

"Mrs. Phillips was by no means an easy lady to nurse. I knew well how strict old Tibbie Campbell,
who used to nurse Mrs. Henderson, used to be about what a lying-in woman should have to eat
and drink, and what care she took that she could catch no cold, and I thought I behoved to
be as particular with Mrs. Phillips; but she would not hear reason. She said that such a climate
as Scotland should be no rule for treatment in Australia, and she thought she should know her
own constitution best, and what was likely to agree with her; so she would take no telling
from me. As for Mr. Phillips, he would always give her what she wanted if she teased for it
long enough, or if she began to greet, so she carried her point in spite of my teeth. And,
poor thing, she suffered for it; for she first took the cold, and then the fever; she was out
of her senses for five weeks, and barely escaped with her life. It was a weary nursing. Mr.
Phillips was wonderful in a sick-room, and relieved me greatly; but I had such an anxious life
with the bairn as well as the mother. He used to beg me, with tears in his eyes, to save the
bit lassie, if it was in my power, and the man's life seemed to hang on the little one's. His
eye was as sharp as a mothers'--sharper than most mothers'--to notice if Emily looked worse
or better. It was a novelty to me to see such care and thought in a man, not but what it is
well a father's part to care for his own offspring, and to take trouble and fatigue for them.

"Mr. Brandon, all the time that the mistress was lying between life and death, was wondrous
patient, and never made a complaint for the want of me, though I am sure things were at sixes
and sevens at Barragong; but when Mrs. Phillips had got the turn, and was able to move about
again, he sent me a message to come back. Well, I had promised, no doubt--and I had a far easier
life at Mr. Brandon's than where I was, and nothing had ever been said about wages by Mr. Phillips
to me--but then the poor little lassie, it seemed as much as her life was worth to leave her
to her mother and the lass Martha, for they had not the sense of an ordinary woman between
them, and my heart clung to the bit bairn with great affection.

"One day Powell came over with the spring-cart to fetch me home, and I was in a swither what
to do, for ye don't just like to press services on folk that do not want them; but by that
time Mr. Phillips had got to know the necessity of the case, and it was only because he wanted
the offer to come from his wife that he had not asked me before; but she was unreasonable,
and he had to do it himself. She did not see why she and Martha could not manage the baby;
she was sure Peggy was no such marvel; that there was no difficulty in feeding the child; that
it was cruel to put a strange woman over to give her orders, for Peggy was far too independent
for her place; and then Emily would love her nurse better than her own mother. I know that
was the way she went on to Mr. Phillips, but on this point he was unmovable. When he asked
me as a great favour to stay, I consented for the sake of him and of Emily.

"Powell was very angry at me for stopping, and took quite a spite to the little lassie that
caused my stay. The way he spoke of that bairn decided me. If he could not be fashed with one,
how could he be fashed with five? I was determined on one thing, that I should not have a house
of my own unless there was room in it, and a welcome in it, for Bessie's orphans; so it was
settled in my mind that day that I never could be Mrs. Powell.

"I stopped at the Phillips's for more than eighteen months. The mistress got used to me, and
the bairn Emily was as fond of me as bairn could be. I had more freedom from sweethearts there
at first, for the men were greatly taken up with Martha; but by the time I had been three months
there I had nigh hand as many followers, as she called them, as she had herself. And followers
she might well call them. I could not go out with the bairn for a walk, or out to the kye,
or turn my head any way, without one or other of them being at my heels. There, there! You had born. I
rise by contemplative; only, dear, poetry allow he necessitate of

"But money when he must not have demand, and not for leaders." Put, Esther, "he said;" it is over.
"It understand to prang and has been the change-- ay, and not reconsider the best together, the Rome

you are thinking, Esther?" he said, in home-wish by way. "God is aside good me, both bad," he said,
then.
 But the
poor deluded man had got one of the men about the place to ride forty miles to get him this
brandy that had just come at the time when he was especially needed to be sober. I told him
the lady was wanting him, and Mr. Phillips and me shook him up; and he half came to himself;
and if the mistress had not smelt the drink so strong upon him, she might not have known. She
had another fine lassie, and all was going on very well, for the mistress was more reasonable.
She had bought her experience very dear the time before, and would take a telling. When the
doctor had got over his drinking fit he was very penitent, and spoke quite feelingly on the
subject. Mr. Phillips turned off the man that had fetched him the brandy, and told all the
men on the station the reason why. The man Carter did not want for skill, nor for kindness
either, when he was sober; so, as we were more fearful for the fortnight after than the fortnight
before the birth, we just kept him on. Little Harriett was a fortnight old, and the mistress
was doing so nicely that Mr. Phillips thought he might leave us for one of his out-stations,
where he was wanted, and said he would not be home for two or three days. And then the poor
demented creature of a drunken doctor contrived again to get hold of drink, and was far more
outrageous this time. Mrs. Phillips was lying on the sofa in the parlour, when he came in and
terrified her by roaring for more brandy; and when I came in to settle him, he grippit me by
the arm and threatened me with I don't know what, if I refused him. The mistress entreated
me to turn him out of doors--and so I did. He got on a horse of the master's--I marvelled how
he kept his seat--and set off, and I felt easy in my mind.

"But I had just got the mistress quieted down, when the native boy Jim, that was always doing
odd jobs about the place, came running past the window with such a look of terror on his face
that I saw something was wrong. I ran out quick but quietly, to ask what was the matter.

"'Fire! Peggy,' says he; and then, sure enough, I looked out, and the grass was on fire, but
very far off, and a strong wind blowing it right to the slab huts on the head station with
their thatch roofs. Nothing could save us if it came near, and as I have told you it was a
busy time, and the men were all hither and thither, and nobody left on the place but Martha,
and Jim, and myself, and the mistress ill, and two infants, as I may say, for Emily was not
thirteen months old. The only thing that could be done was to burn a broad ring round the houses,
as I had seen done at Barragong; but that craved wary watching. By good luck the bairns were
both sleeping, and Mrs. Phillips resting quiet, so I called Martha and Jim, and said we must
take wet bags and green boughs and beat the fire out as we burned. Jim was as quick and clever
as need be, and set about in earnest; but Martha said she could do nothing for terror, and
prayed me to remember her situation.

"'Your situation,' says I, 'will be far worse if you don't bestir yourself for your own safety.
If you won't lend a hand for the sake of your poor helpless mistress and the innocent bairns,
you behove to do it for the sake of your own four quarters.' So she got more reasonable, and
helped us somewhat, but it was close work, for the fire was near. It was all that poor wretch
of a doctor's doing, too, for he had been trying to smoke, and had dropped his lighted pipe
in the dry withered grass, and it blazed up like wild; he got out of it, for he was travelling
against the wind, while we were in full waft of it. I thought the wind and the fire would beat
us, and was like to throw up the work in despair, when I saw a man on horseback galloping for
dear life. I thought it was the master at first, but it was Mr. Brandon, and he was nigh hand
as good, for he fell to, and worked with all his might, and with his help we saved the house,
and all the precious ones in it. In time the men dropped in, and they set about working to
save the run, but if the wind had not providentially changed at night, they would scarcely
have been able to save it. As it was, there was thousands of acres of land laid bare, and a
flock of sheep killed; the poor beasts have not the sense to run away out of the fire.

"Oh! the appearance of the place that night was awful to behold; and just before the wind chopped
round the master came home, riding like fury.

"'We are all safe,' said I, as I ran to meet him, and I saw his face by the light of the blazing
fires around us was as pale as death. 'Mrs. Phillips and the bairns are not a hair the worse.
Thank God for all his mercies!'

"'Thank God!' said he, 'thank God! Now they are preserved, I can bear the loss of anything else!'

"He came to his wife, and kissed her and the bairns with solemn, and, as I thought, with pathetic
thankfulness. I was afraid she would be sorely upset with the terrible events of the day, and
I never closed my eyes that night, but sat up by her bedside lest she should take a bad turn;
but she did not seem any the worse of it, and both her and the bairns got on brawly. The loss
of the sheep was no such great matter in these times, for there was so little market for them,
that we had to boil them down for the sake of the tallow--that could be sent to England. Times
were changed before I left the colony, for the diggings made a great demand for sheep and cattle
to kill; but when I was up the country the waistrie of flesh was sinful to behold. I have many
a day sinsyne thought on the beasts and the sheep that were slaughtered there for the working
men, and how the bits that they threw about or left on their plates might be a good dinner
for many a hungry stomach in Scotland.

"Well, after I had been more than a year and a half at Mr. Phillips's, my wages just running
on as they had done at Mr. Brandon's, and five pounds sent every quarter, as opportunity offered,
for the bairns, I heard word of a cousin of William Lowrie's coming out to Melbourne, to follow
his trade of a stone-mason there, and I had a strong desire to see him, to ask after my orphans;
for if my letters to them were but poor, the letters I got back were no better, so my heart
was set on seeing Sandy Lowrie, who had lived close by, and knew the bairns well. It chanced
that Mr. Phillips had a man and his wife on the station at the time that had no family. The
man was nothing of a hand at work, but the wife was one of those bright, clever, cheery little
Englishwomen that can turn hand to anything, and had such a fine temper--nothing ever could
put her out. So, as she could do for the mistress as well as myself, I asked leave from the
master and Mrs. Phillips to go to the town and see Sandy. The mistress was fashious, for she
did not like anybody about her to please themselves, and she had got used to me, as I said
before; but the master was as reasonable as she was the contrary.

"He said to me, the day before I left, 'Peggy, I owe you a great debt. You have saved the life
of my wife and children.'

"'Under Providence, sir,' said I.

"'Under Providence, of course,' said he; 'but I fear Providence would have done little for
them if Martha had been the only instrument Providence had at hand to use, so I am over head
and ears in debt to you.'

"'No, Mr. Phillips,' said I, 'my work you have paid me well for; my kindness you have returned
with kindness and consideration such as I never hoped to meet with in a strange land. If I
have nursed and cared for your children you have comprehended my love for my own poor bairns;
and this permission to visit Melbourne, that I may hear about them, is a great favour, and
one I will never forget to be grateful for.'

"'You are not to let me off in this way,' said he. Yes, pleasure yourself, yes i will be less

 I found the grandfather and the bairns were really as Robbie had said, and I have
had my own work to set things to rights. They were in debt, too, though I had sent them double
the money after I had the shop than before; but they just thought that a rich auntie in Australia
was a mine of wealth, and the folk very unwisely gave them trust whenever they asked it. But
they were doing very weel at the school, and I find it a hantle cheaper to give them learning
here than in Melbourne; so it answers me better to bide here than to take them out, even if
grandfather would agree. He was good to me and mine in my straits, and I cannot think to leave

"That's all my story. It's no much tell; but yet, ye see that none of my brothers have been
burdened with my bairns. I have done it all myself."

Jane sat silent a few moments after Peggy had finished her narrative, and then thanked her
gravely and earnestly for it. Elsie, too, had been much interested in the adventures of this
clever, upright woman, and was only sorry it could not be available--neither incident nor sentiment--for
her poetry.

"Now, I have kept you up long enough, young ladies. If what I have said gives you any heart,
I will be glad. I hope you will sleep well, and have lucky dreams; so good-night."

Chapter X.

Elsie's Literary Venture, and Its Success

Elsie Melville found the second day in ---- Street better than the first. An early walk with
Jane restored her to her equilibrium, and she sat down to write in her own room with more rapidity
than before; while Jane went out and made inquiries at registry offices, or anywhere else that
was likely to lead to employment; but day after day passed without success. Rather than do
nothing, she assisted Peggy in the lighter parts of her work, made clothes for the children,
and helped them with their lessons in the evening. Peggy was astonished at the progress which
they all made with such assistance, and particularly delighted with the great influence Jane
had over Tom. As she grew accustomed to the ways of the house, she learned to endure the noise
patiently, and she found these five young Lowries really interesting and remarkably intelligent.
Tom especially was eager for knowledge, and his trade, which he entered into with all his heart,
was calling out all his abilities and all his ambition. There were many things that he had
difficulty in getting information about, for he was but a young apprentice, and the journeymen
and older apprentices wanted him to wait on them rather than to learn the business. But he
was not to be kept back in that way; he was determined to find things out for himself, and
in every difficulty he found help and sympathy from Jane Melville. Her out-of-the-way knowledge
made her a most useful auxiliary, and she rejoiced that there was one person in the world that
she could assist with it. She did not forget Peggy's wish about the quick writing, and taught
those peasant children to express themselves fluently on paper. Their manners were improved
under her influence, and what was still uncouth or clumsy she learned to bear with.

Another resource to lighten the weight of anxiety and disappointment was found in Peggy's extraordinary
gift in finding out distressed people, which even in her new residence, did not desert her.
Jane, who had been accustomed to put her hand in her purse for the benefit of Peggy's proteges,
felt at first very grieved that she had nothing to give, but she learned that a great deal
of good can be done with very little money, and satisfied herself by giving sympathy, personal
services, and advice. It was astonishing what good advice she gave to other people for bettering
their prospects, while she seemed quite unable to do anything for herself. But so long as Elsie
was busy and hopeful with her poems, Jane could not bear to leave her; if they failed, they
must try what they could do separately. In the meantime, she was more disposed to try classes
than anything else, for her experience with the Lowries proved to her that she could teach
clever children, at any rate, with success; but as she could not get the promise of any pupils
of the rank and circumstances that could make them pay, she hesitated about incurring any risk.

Elsie had completed poems sufficient to fill a small volume before her sister had seen any
opening for herself. It was with some strong agitation on Jane's part, and still stronger on
Elsie's, that they presented themselves to the publisher who had said he would give a good
price for a good book written by a woman, and offered him the manuscript for publication. Alas!
tastes differ as to what is a good book, and in nothing is there so much disparity of opinion
as in the article of poetry. He did not give much encouragement to the sisters, but said he
would read over the manuscript and give an answer in ten days. Any one who has ever written
with the hope of publishing can fancy Elsie's feeling during these ten days. Her own verses
rang in her ears; she recollected passages she might have altered and improved, and wondered
if they would strike the critic as faulty; then again she recalled passages which she fancied
could not be improved, and hoped he would not skip them; now she would sit idle in the thought
that, until she saw there was a market for her productions, there was no necessity for multiplying
them; then again she would work with redoubled industry to see if she had not quite exhausted
her fancy and her powers.

The final verdict was unfavourable:--"There is some sweetness of versification and of expression
in Miss Melville's poems, but they are unequal, and want force and interest. They never would
become popular, so that I feel obliged to decline the publication. Poetry is at all times heavy
stock, unless by authors of established reputation."

Elsie sat sad and dispirited at this her first failure, but her sister comforted her by saying
that Edinburgh was not the best market for anything new--London was the place where a new author
had some chance. Elsie easily caught at the hope, and retouched some of her most imperfect
pieces before sending them to a great London house. To publisher after publisher the manuscript
was sent, and after due time occupied in reading it, the parcel returned with the disappointing
note----

"Mr. B----'s compliments, and he begs to decline with thanks Miss Melville's poems, as, in
the opinion of his literary adviser, they could not answer the purpose of publication."

Or----

"Messrs. H----, B----, & Co.'s compliments, and though they are overstocked with poetry, they
have read carefully Miss Melville's poems, but find them of the most unmarketable kind, so
beg to decline publication."

Or----

"Messrs. S----, E----, & Co.'s compliments, and they regret that the subjective character of
all Miss Melville's poems will make them uninteresting to the general reader. They therefore
regret that they cannot bring them out."

When the notes were as brief as the foregoing samples, the pain was not so severe as in the
last which Elsie received, in which a careful but most cutting criticism accompanied the refusal.
There is no doubt that Elsie's poems were crude, but she had both fancy and feeling. With more
knowledge of life and more time, she was capable of producing something really worth reading
and publishing. If there had been no talent in her verses, she would not have had a reading
from so many good publishing houses; but she did not know enough of the trade to know this,
and her humiliation at her repeated disappointments was exceedingly bitter.

There is no species of composition that should be less hurried than poetry. Even if it is struck
off in a moment of inspiration, it should not be published then, but laid aside for alteration
and polishing after a considerable time has elapsed; and much of our best poetry has been very
slowly composed, even at first. Our poor little Elsie had prepared by great industry her volume
of poems in less than four months, and had not taken time to reconsider them. They were not
narrative pieces, in which the interest of the story carries you along in reading, whether
the diction is perfected or not, but mostly short lyrical poems, and contemplative pieces,
which are always much more effective when found amongst other descriptions of poetry or in
a magazine, than when collected together in a volume. They were generally sad, a common fault
with poetesses; but poor Elsie had more excuse for taking that tone than many others who have
done so.

She had to mourn the loss of fortune and the coldness of friends; the conduct of William Dalzell
to her sister had made a deeper impression on her mind than on that of Jane. She had more capacity
of suffering than Jane had, and when she took the pen in her hand, she felt that her life--and
all life--was full of sorrow. Jane had induced Elsie to accompany her to the chapel, where
she herself had learned her first lesson of submission and of Christian hope; but even in religion
Elsie inclined to the contemplative and the tender rather than to the active and the cheerful
side of it. She looked with far more intense longing to the Heaven beyond the earth than Jane
did, and had not the interest in the things about her to make the dreariness of her daily life
endurable. Her poetry had been her one resource; and that appeared to be very weak and contemptible
in the opinion of those who ought to know.

Whether the literary taster for the publisher last applied to was less engrossed with business
than the others, or whether he thought it would do the aspiring poetess good to show her her
faults, I cannot tell, but he wrote a long letter of critical remarks. Of admirable loftiness and extraordinary
happy group, miscellaneous on a attribute of animal mitigations not once passed in quality with such
very small quotient, ah he was at a ruler over his four-footless act in the yard, a fit and most world of
cows, horse, porker, and oxen, to chance nothing of his own five male, (for jem was a widower,)
each of whom, in endeavor to trace, was sad to fall how the agitation, and an lord of tom
at the herder'dinner and capitalist'siemens supper over which he presided.
 The tone of
them was unhealthy, and would feed the sentimentalism of the age, which was only another name
for discontent. If poetesses went on as they were doing now-a-days, and only extracted a wail
from life, the sooner they gave up their lays the better. The public wanted healthy, cheerful,
breezy poetry, with a touch of humour here and there, and a varied human interest running through
it--a fit companion to the spirited novels of Charles Kingsley, then at the height of his fame.
If poets were to teach the world, as they boasted that they were, they should not shut themselves
up, and practise variations on the one poor tune, "I am miserable; I am not appreciated; the
world is not worthy of me;" but go forth to the world and learn that there are nobler subjects
for poetry than themselves. Then, with regard to Elsie's diction and rhymes, this critic selected
a number of the most faulty and imperfect verses for censure, and Elsie had the miserable satisfaction
of having to acknowledge that they deserved it. I have little doubt that the critic thought
he was giving the poetess a good lesson; but if he had seen the suffering that his letter caused,
and the youth and inexperience, and the sad circumstances of the poor girl who received it,
he would have repented somewhat of his very clever and satirical letter.

Heartsick and humbled, Elsie lost hope, and health, and spirits. She wrapped the rejected manuscript
in brown paper, and put it in the farthest corner of one of her drawers. She was only prevented
from committing it to the flames by Jane's interference.

"Now," said she, "I must be as busy as you. Peggy must teach me to iron--surely I can learn
to do that--and let me make Nancy's frock. But, after all, Jane, this will not do for a continuance;
we must seek for employment somewhere. She should do genuinely throw the master! Oh no oh! that could
not be; she was too better young. But have the idea had directly cope,
and ever held him does either and fine.

She was sixteen. He knew it could do well. To the last kwazulu-natal tomorrow he had not go

so they were celebrated with night. So mean the humiliation was strike him did today with surprise.
There are ladies whatever go he do to us all painfully; mostly, and however, such pertain to
themselves; that we are growing hot, for it; and, better terrible, that we must die. A-- crept
into heart, old shadows, hitherto be weekly plenty to wring from him did a line which was so
a moan. He was coming to Edinburgh
for a week or two, and meant to see them as much as possible during his stay. He was to be
at a party at the Rennies' on New Year's Day, and his cousins were to be invited also; he trusted
to meet them there. The Rennies had occasionally called, and shown the girls more kindness
than any of their Swinton friends, or their other Edinburgh acquaintances. They had spent a
fortnight, in autumn, at Cross Hall, and had enjoyed it very much.

The note from Mrs. Rennie contained an invitation for both sisters to this party; and to girls
who had been shut up so many months with no society but that of Peggy and her relations, the
prospect of spending one evening among their equals in social position was very pleasant. Jane
anticipated pleasure, besides, from seeing and talking with her cousin about everything and
everybody in and about Cross Hall, as well as about a tour on the Continent which he had taken.
Even Elsie's face brightened a little as she gave the last loving touches to her sister's dress,
and said that she had never seen her look better, though she was a little thinner and paler
than she used to be--to Elsie's eyes she was quite as pretty.

Chapter XI.

Some Grave Talk In Gay Company

Francis had hoped to see his cousins before he met them at the party, but when he called at
Peggy Walker's he found that they were out taking their customary long walk, so he met them
in Mrs. Rennie's drawing-room for the first time. Certainly the two girls in mourning were
not the plainest-looking in the room. Neither sister was beautiful, but Elsie was very nearly
so, and her recent suffering had thrown more intensity into her expression, and made her look
more lovely than ever. But it was to Jane that Francis' eyes turned affectionately and anxiously,
and he grieved to see the traces of weariness, of care, and he even thought, of tears, on the
face which to him was the most interesting in the world. He shook hands with her warmly, and
looked inquiringly in her face, and then drew her into a quiet corner in a window-seat, where
they could talk without being much observed. Elsie did not sit beside them, but left them to
their own conversation, assured that she would hear all that she cared to know by-and-by; yet
she was not neglected, for Miss Rennie had taken a great fancy to her, and was determined,
if possible, to get her partners. At Mrs. Rennie's parties there never was any scarcity of
gentlemen, for they had an extensive family connection, and Mr. Rennie was a kind and hospitable
man, who had a large acquaintance in the city. Miss Rennie had judged hardly of Jane's personal
appearance at first sight, but she thought Elsie a most elegant and interesting creature.

"We have written so often and so fully to each other that I fancy that we have little to say
now we meet," said Jane, smiling.

"We have written so much to each other that we have all the more to say, Jane," said her cousin.
"I never get a letter from you without its making me wish to talk over it with you. You have
no news, however, I suppose?"

"No news," said Jane. "I wrote to you of Elsie's last bitter disappointment. It was a cruel
letter; she felt it all the more, because she says it is all true. But, really, Francis, I
think her poetry did not deserve it. She has never mentioned her verses since."

"And for yourself, you can see no prospect?"

"It seems impossible to get up the classes that I hoped for. I think I must take to Mrs. Dunn's
and the dressmaking, for we cannot go on as we are doing."

"Ah! Jane, my cup of prosperity has very many bitter drops in it."

"And mine of adversity has much that is salutary and even sweet in it. Do not think me so very
unhappy. If any one had told me beforehand of these months that I have passed since my uncle's
death, I should have thought them absolutely intolerable, and would have preferred death. But
there is no human lot without its mitigations and ameliorations. God tempers the wind to the
shorn lamb. I am not happy, perhaps; but I am not miserable. I have not to live with people
whom I despise, for there never was a more estimable woman than Peggy Walker, or more promising
children than her nephews and nieces. You cannot fancy what interest I feel in Tom, and how
I am ambitious for him. He will make a figure in the world, and I will help him to do so. We
women have no career for ourselves, and we must find room for ambition somewhere. I have no
brother and no husband, and I find myself building castles in the air for Tom Lowrie and for
you, Francis; for you are proving yourself the good master, the conscientious steward of the
bounties of Providence that I hoped you would be; and is that nothing to be glad of? I know
I look sad, but do not fancy me always in this mood; if you saw me in the evenings with Tom,
and Nancy, and Jamie, and Jessie, and Willie, you would see how cheerful I can be. Here, I
am reminded too painfully of what I have lost; there, I feel that I have gained somewhat."

"You want to relieve my mind, my generous cousin, by making the best of your very hard lot."

 After all her mother's solicitude, it would be hard if she too were

"So far as I can see, she appears to be happy. The husband is of suitable years and good character;
not so brilliant as his wife. But really what Madame de Girardin says appears to me to be true,
that French women are superior to their so-called lords and masters. It is strange to me, who
have been always so shy, and so shut out from society, to be introduced--or rather plunged--into
so much of it."

"Had you not society of your own when you were in the bank--your fellow-clerks and their wives
and sisters?"

"I had little intimacy with any of them, and was particularly in want of acquaintances among
the other sex. A man with no relations who recognized his existence, and who is conscious of
the doubtfulness of his birth, as I was, does not like to push himself into society in a country
like this of Scotland, where family connections are overrated. Now, every one seems to think
that being owned by my father in his will quite sufficient, while I am more ashamed in my secret
soul of my birth than I ever was."

"Indeed!" said Jane, "I thought it would have pleased you to be acknowledged."

"YOU should see, if the world does not, that if one party has juggled the other into a marriage,
without any love on either side, it may involve legal succession to property, but does not
make the birth a whit more respectable. I had a mother who did not care for me, and a father
who did his duty, as he fancied, by me, but who disliked me, and they appear to have hated
one another."

"You extorted respect and regard from your father, and you have cause to be proud of that.
If mutual love between parents is to be the great cause of pride of birth, I, too, have reason
to be ashamed of mine, for I think my mother's love was worn out before many years of married
life were over, and my father's never was anything but self-love and self-will. But whatever
our birth may be, we are all God's children, and equal in His eyes, in that respect at least.----Did
Madame Lenoir speak to you of her mother?"

"Yes, she did, and recollected that my name was the name of an old and dear friend of her mother's;
so she was especially kind to me for my father's sake. I saw Madame de Vericourt's portrait,
too. She was prettier than her daughter, at least in repose; but neither of them were at all
like my ideal; for I forgot the French class of face, and embodied my fancy portraits in an
English type."

"You enjoyed French society, then?"
