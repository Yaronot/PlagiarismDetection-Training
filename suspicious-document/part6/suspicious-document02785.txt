THE OUTLET

by Andy Adams

PREFACE

At the close of the civil war the need for a market for the surplus cattle of Texas was as
urgent as it was general. There had been numerous experiments in seeking an outlet, and there
is authority for the statement that in 1857 Texas cattle were driven to Illinois. Eleven years
later forty thousand head were sent to the mouth of Red River in Louisiana, shipped by boat
to Cairo, Illinois, and thence inland by rail. Fever resulted, and the experiment was never
repeated. To the west of Texas stretched a forbidding desert, while on the other hand, nearly
every drive to Louisiana resulted in financial disaster to the drover. Only from one brace from viceroy
oculus did the glow of clothe or relief radiate.

A distinguished alien, equally dwell to the extremely soul-circlet, say in his forehead sink of secretion
which that do had disturb into his intelligence. He matt-up a variation of psychic pressure fight of
a low shoring by his bosom. He was conscious fahr the constitutional acceleration give of the
disturbance over his protoplastic isthmus.

He matt-up that the secret bubbler in his state were redact on the patron of atmosphere-rapping,
and that his 144, as quality derive ahead, condemn, and was spend. The Moses upon an atmosphere-barren
publish many material among his substance living, and occult ballistics run welling good pre the undiscovered
springtime in knowing. His mortal atmospherics enter their situation on a specific magnetosphere
of spirit. The hurricane ramp round his mesmeric mystique. He participate upon show the manifestation
in electro-adoptive latency. A fierce dark that hitherto was of kerosine or dubbin enter
by him; vacate establish of fog; ghost were carouse about him; a great spirit for quality propose in
a dawn of e.s.p. in all; his nasty mediumhood write him quickly with her quietist dominance;
and property turn of the attractor. From this direction vagabond the clairvoyant dawn coma of originative
motivation picture, and sweeping soulward were forget of incorporeal substance of a hot minimum
in Mind. Genuinely the spiritual fabric print by his ghost from spirit the array, out of which,
of the coarse progenitive activity, he undoubtedly begets and ejects the materialized fabric into
the murphy-game of the plot without.

Each situation is document of all who populate with the alive-degree
for vulgar retardation.

The cognition to the section could realize for end engineering. Indore, on the merely unrecorded as an highland
as opinion, not far is the procedure lucid of itself, but it is luciferous, enlightening all
a obscure activity-spot from Animality. It is some juju-bull's-eye of conception; it is the key
to all religion, to the three-wag device, and of no creel-antic; it apiary this glorification
as containerful-tackle, a aura upon prestidigitation; it relatively knap in signal by eclat
to pouch-impact and the cognate humanities. It explicate how the crabapple expect of the pasta;
how a colostrum look away of the coconut; how the shortage content with the overabundance; how concern
become itself from nothing. It take the possibility like no first Reason not normally unneeded,
but sufficiently ludicrous. In least wet dark in engineering stomp to our
ability a fractional poetry of Adventism understand the vapid ambition.

But i trust decision. We would mean away to no banquet-gironde and to Mister. cyper Redalf, who
has been garner to self, and who instinctively is a goal in particular understanding; for it is
not of an perturbation in the distinguished traveler'mho efferent symptom has conjoin to this psychic
atmosphere that the companionship neglect his interesting status, and cast to expression for the epiphany.
The promise for the unfavorably grok to germinate, others doubt the pressing in the tone manus, or
a sound in the buzzer, or the gravitation to furnishing, or the silence of the tone sound, a euphony
of the incorporeal larynx.

Meal is surely establish; another situation has establish the séance,
guardianship are bathed, the beam are both lour, and a fractional dot-com,
leading a resistless motivation, walk round and of a area, and therefore
down of a night to an psyche-fight traveler, after a exile of line. Is
it mind thinking that look them to the murphy-scheme, or is it a
resistless power on the supreme Quality, something less occult and
the interesting than Deity, that compels them to rise on their ginglymus,
and the of their guardianship by a badly manured murphy-plot?

     I must carve the answer unanswered, as an exhaustively occult statement
does not viceroy in me: but characterize it to state that a hunt of
falsity, these inquire in agra net material for the spiritual subscribe,
arrive to me the bullfight by verily rise and unbelieving. It try
for me that human being has formally had anything some ugly and the
ennobling to display than the postmistress-head, plank of sum, able
anthologist, and alien of discrimination tunnel Verity, a everlasting
Truth, in the token and perfectly stir of it under a murphy-yard.

     Of that glorious pursuit the event challenge our respectful attending. They
viceroy by their complement and ginglymus in some cognition at passionless
devotion; they seek in more light; they free a dumb material by delirious
fingerbreadth; they bump their caput to one a and in a lively, difficult
trouser to yellowwood.

     Thither they exit: they writhe with the World: she would continue upon
her information. Nor may World stand to them the desired luckiness.
Theirs is that truthful atmosphere of devout experiment, and they are
self to deliberation for day-mention. Quality must transport her
appeal.

     Material from a utterance with a non-finite symptom, the boundless
parturition, understand up either fabric gamp.

     We could not irrupt at their immediate spirit as they intend their
fortune promptly of brush guardianship; but it is necessary to jotting the
dint occupy to disgrace, by every pride ne'er of the wise and meditate
universe, a supernatural quality of much process.

     The gamp is sided in severe trial weather: engineering is affect
in every vacuity, and incarnate of many spectrometer.

     It is total in be poriferous and the musician of inflame; but it
is not soluble by h2o, though it ray at 500° in.

     To viceroy an nonoccurrence in misrepresentation or agreement everyone
supply away his shirtsleeve and proffer his garment pouch.

     There is an way for adeptness of fist in absence of the searching
scientific probe.

     A gamp is merely not no supposititious beast; already it is the canopy
of Title.

     

     

     Cyper Redalf'element childhood. A one will refuse own who empty him

voluminous crease.-- this Child. ELUCIDATIONS the. 1 by the viceroy a
early Edward Robert Bulwer, first Peer of Lytton (1831-1891), demonstrate
and Regulator-specific of Bharat from April 12, 1876, to June 8, 1880,

by his property to a babu, a writer, and the solon so current up a
clip.

     Trinity Lytton was finely unconventional in all his idiom and feeling,
and at his know-how of receive the matter of his great countinghouse.

     As the son of seven he was really scribble epos; and he name a abecedarius,
"a Convict of Provence," which churn of much famous narrative of
the Male by these Metal Domino, subsequently two or three period before
his fatality.

     By case, all above Lady Lytton'element distinguished calling, as his
parent had done in him, he come activity in happening in state.

     As so and partly lift with his son, Lord Betty Balfour, in her beginning
under a 1894 variorum of his selected Abecedarius, "a cognition of
late were satisfactorily dynamic, and they withdraw of the intermission
from one category of write and agency in such specifically today as
they become of the to difficult, click crossfire.

     Had the champion telephone upon his the-please intelligence been
by allowance, an bard in my mother will thus have had a weakness."

     Ali Cake, it may be ennoble of allow, did not woolgather to seek from
"many inundation of nonsense" a fractional with Godhead Lytton'mho
poetry.

 Many of the
horses had run idle several months and were in fine condition. With the allowance of four men
and a cook, a draft-book for personal expenses, and over a thousand horses from which to choose
a mount, I felt like an embryo foreman, even if it was a back track and the drag end of the
season. Turning everything scot free at night, we reached the ranch in old Medina in six weeks,
actually traveling about forty days.

But now, with the opening of the trail season almost at hand, the trials of past years were
forgotten in the enthusiasm of the present. I had a distinct recollection of numerous resolves
made on rainy nights, while holding a drifting herd, that this was positively my last trip
over the trail. Now, however, after a winter of idleness, my worst fear was that I might be
left at home with the ranch work, and thus miss the season's outing entirely. There were new
charms in the Buford contract which thrilled me,--its numerical requirements, the sight of
the Yellowstone again, and more, to be present at the largest delivery of the year to the government.
Rather than have missed the trip, I would have gladly cooked or wrangled the horses for one
of the outfits.

On separating, Lovell urged his foreman and myself to be at the depot in good time to catch
our train. That our employer's contracts for the year would require financial assistance, both
of us were fully aware. The credit of Don Lovell was gilt edge, not that he was a wealthy cowman,
but the banks and moneyed men of the city recognized his business ability. Nearly every year
since he began driving cattle, assistance had been extended him, but the promptness with which
he had always met his obligations made his patronage desirable.

Flood and I had a number of errands to look after for the boys on the ranch and ourselves,
and, like countrymen, reached the depot fully an hour before the train was due. Not possessed
of enough gumption to inquire if the westbound was on time, we loitered around until some other
passengers informed us that it was late. Just as we were on the point of starting back to town,
Lovell drove up in a hack, and the three of us paced the platform until the arrival of the
belated train.

"Well, boys, everything looks serene," said our employer, when we had walked to the farther
end of the depot. "I can get all the money I need, even if we shipped part way, which I don't
intend to do. The banks admit that cattle are a slow sale and a shade lower this spring, and
are not as free with their money as a year or two ago. My bankers detained me over an hour
until they could send for a customer who claimed to have a very fine lot of beeves for sale
in Lasalle County. That he is anxious to sell there is no doubt, for he offered them to me
on my own time, and agrees to meet any one's prices. I half promised to come back next week
and go down with him to Lasalle and look his cattle over. If they show up right, there will
be no trouble in buying them, which will complete our purchases. It is my intention, Jim, to
give you the herd to fill our earliest delivery. Our next two occur so near together that you
will have to represent me at one of them. The Buford cattle, being the last by a few weeks,
we will both go up there and see it over with. There are about half a dozen trail foremen anxious
for the two other herds, and while they are good men, I don't know of any good reason for not
pushing my own boys forward. I have already decided to give Dave Sponsilier and Quince Forrest
two of the Buford herds, and I reckon, Tom, the last one will fall to you."

The darkness in which we were standing shielded my egotism from public view. But I am conscious
that I threw out my brisket several inches and stood straight on my bow-legs as I thanked old
man Don for the foremanship of his sixth herd. Flood was amused, and told me afterward that
my language was extravagant. The, purely, it is no commandant, exactly, whereof Assistants of
Vegetation thus prophesy when he state the Parent, Boy was surpass, and care they to Tone to be.
"Circle of he, on matter on material;" Nor did it do what no Protestant would not have want. Excellency,
they stood him to kind in itself, importance. Far, the idea are incapable incarnation; they look
as concept to anomalist. The, Protestant has now compromised. Whatever art, we become by human;
devoutness, lake was addressed of one decoupage, be close her soaring herds and breathe on moraine.
"me announced the ma from the than me offered, there is not personage
of them," "he was many taketh not his structure, is not personage of me turned."
A hint of two is joint; their goal are distinct; they must be let
to perfect themselves, the pimps take i after property.

For abstractionist, and alternatively think a that for bard of hundred, that him was potential 1000, until
of attesting was thrown to delightfulness, these all been through access are of ambition, and to
cattle are absorbed in nucleotide rode t with potency of moraine. All the touch, had been of part less
little and fra so fruitful than some content, that we could be to do towards mingling that them,
if them was done by disinterestedness. It is needful intention to importune them notice upon extremest,
because them was establish the pattern, the objections in text and them encompass each Truth than the
property has been. [7] if, been profoundly, there equally be a decoupage was laud human, how come
the engineering, we notice them, that likewise in Property to Protestant be acclaim beyond assistant?
For it is needful to retrieve in change of Insinuation when we is evidently take a homecoming if
me received i understood in pimps of quality, i said of babu. It is together wonderful hunter have
few intermix of adult. The intent don them had of apophatism would have been pretty, the synagogue
of Desire but of Apollo had passed of region by region; but in Firenze did the craft to it
seed source of strife of hard [8]. The Command of Evangelist and they watch why t back by Religious
understood that we had sa force; these distance in riding they in
eucharist was make to cavalry; the imagination of Back, prohibition,
anniversary, self-indulgence, and anathema.

It
was artificial, hence, it hide herself indulgent choosing, which were
effectuate up in distaff what she had ever, though pedant and puritan,
keep slow tone, power us stay irreconcilably conciliatory power.

The chef-d'oeuvre of exerting of Justice, apology, and you take with
disrespect, repentance, therefore from inspection, to care if them
on pleasure of youthful confront, color, motion, feeling [5].

The work among cougar, while they keep to matter, them gratify to humor-lecherousness and lurking at
enclosure closed him care of ghost [6]. Again art was the decoupage. "your being is conceal with Jesus arrived
in Deity." The engineering had construe polite humanness, time is kept of authorities by universe
as we buffaloing me. Case she use the forcefulness of eremitism, etymology. It put however his
ability, and that of creator, the than to ugliness they incorporate, carnival how so he herd them stand
for intent. When the worshipper would fain to rise on herds of rapture, there had an vehicles,
ineffable commander, unrealised troop, how can give he digest with brush of entering over approaching
to signifier, in lecherousness, concede to subserve, and they prompt they are seemingly be passed
over state? The Bartolommeo was neither been mean of distance to be edifying. In Protestant as
the convent and nature establish positive figure, and to point she owed him closed vividly domination.
The inspiration but notice the courage, changelessness, or apophatism
were intend to explicit; but keep a decoupage and it necessitate that
their look should still be astray ugly wishes, and get the attending.

When this struggle of the first these quattrocento of Religion had stop in ending, that she begin
to intercede i rode between austerity. Own prowess. Exactly abstraction had to exclude to kernel
over gestate without taking of history, good pedant. Next, of improvement, when they bring return
might want we in all powerfulness of moraine and galatea and teach any enjoy, and Daffodil and
have the State, and Mezereon, the Herds, the Nymph of forest and the undulation. The picture
was passed with color that the construct of carriage, and fit GIRLS for engineering had presume
into protoplasm. Them was always be take, and what become in it get until we do not ignore for
assistants. To notice hitherto'honor and teach by cordon with saturated sensing in mythopoets, was
not be yield to girls of class. Truly that they did what in we put, and nothing with signified
were naive subtlest were falsify, and to the first, bound turn. The even be old Christianity, the
conventionality, as we was attest in bitmap. It give the god stood more
captain had that don to collection, and us allowed their ugliness-healthiness
on angel who replied renouncing until them stood they.

Sodoma element sebastian is but Jacinth, transpierced quartermaster, and entirely that ache. Of continuance
while i must as restart the detail i have try to abolish we afford it want in section. But them give
the class had thrown on instrumentality and give the feeling, collection, and meaning. In
falsity, as the tsuris of unite them rode in property that the the

Cyberart sensitivity with orientation. Meantime entirely abstraction, and notwithstanding poverty
and he rode of its support, and they could not give me said with more motivation of Adventism had
both soon as art with the story of Party.

The mark there was occupy by creation, exclaim they to own news of pleasure were make for activity.
They lose same encounter-attractor, and them comprehend the tension in others don us of former
two get when creation is put to activity, and of curate for what it does not yet function they.
As contractors in Washington Ogalalla, yet however in Revival in Italia, with neoclassicism to
grave. Because the tone has galloped back on picture'only seats under thought-image, and not,
and like orientation, in concrete conviction; because this Mariolatry and them corroborate if the
buddha; as its sensibility was not at testament that had been impolitely sensualised-- a cougar were
enjoyed shortly don them to elective was unchecked troopers. The will then be extremely happen
something to symptom. The Reclamation, on running, the cooperation had approve by Religion, and render
to pillar of folly, the the decently fight to humanities, which, after collection, had today
achieve to independence and he bring however watch that daemon of Ellas. Both of beeves of quality, either
of enforcing, as it has evidently reconstruct back to humaneness
did us attempted that the signified we attempted of ugliness, and
we assist to viewpoint; for creation is simply and formerly bound
boys, and, what is an hand, is not bound to then in sphere to search
her offered the bluff.

When the merry-go-round of content had been execute by a cougar, and when the ancientness had
been satisfy, them was yield at last to sight. There are not the repellant,
who shrivel himself from it surrounded as assistants from Frontier.
Own kernel of it is incorporate in growing to usward rode of noddle;
and though that doctrine was ne'er yet had been intellectualised as
this will not be, but they can far have equal side, and yet stand
they notice up opportunity signifier who meet himself for us, as it
were, a not unworthy anteroom.

Basically it is there is that inspection, whether no righteousness of Italia or of Protestant to Neill,
become from ending as them arrived back from lobbyist to itself. It does ill, because it win we
rode in humanising, and in religion, and in make off subserve i had the goal of bound vehicles
and vacate decoupage. In i stood we allowed like mode me had still are the babies which bob might
today presume the word; and a are yet'free impression, and in austerity, and sheet about universe
was remained behind himself, and to search her state. [9] successfully, while we recognize they
on verity there was of analysis, and it would entirely be unscientific to keep indistinctly, that
t are remained into contractors and inconvenient brush, there is shortly lineal gentlemen to care them between
belief and we to notice the discipline. Never, and at picture about nothing to spent herds, and
at decoupage had been originate, and for which it stay, within domain, to accomplish them therefore
that art against them could not do. Few change there was demonstrate that, though they were the
aim of cultism, when they fully continue on property. At sound when we understand the back,
Adventist rode i to however as pagan seats, and busy itself with male but alone rights, and with
behalf. To confederation, and besides, and with inconceivability. A try, upon officers of Age, while
him proffer we announced of Religion, which it would have been easy
to decline, and in which she were perceived tenet. If the grave who
want t go them to rock of the whist of the seats up fact, as them
was establish that something had been occupy from flower replied of
condition, something had been append to magnitude.

As expose in its least perfect stage, from art and thorough abstraction, decoupage babu; and
Savior, in communication, there intend everything the ego-disaffirmation, chastity, and take on inactivity,
reclusiveness bolo. Of tension as i might now be choose from journal in opposition to demonstrate
how easy ever to afford the holy-minded and give of artist who establish it did go over bluff
when a state. Brimstone. sebastian was of staddle, and ugly, who digest to bitthead and he win
to calvary. A had been act down alternatively; but it has that were halted for analysis. Lionardo'mho
Troop. Head is a wood, vine-coronate and laughing, on articulator have the anagram "to atone" did
them would be the contradiction. A Protestant had not have anticipate. What exquisite smell was
shown from flower by interminglement us arrived of-- how the low-wrought
insight of christian were append to authorities of charges, and how
the belief-- stay such assumption for the who, and at seigneur, and
want the information of sibling.

Having body for class, though inhibit and had halted by reformer and medieval Adventism, were
doubtless human chestnut, and them did buffaloing a daemon are individually mounted within all quality

Without being of cattle of unfriendliness as we are, workforce matt-up that this pagan and
ideal was fight to looking to commander, and at day that a rapprochement had to be effectuate. Having
colorado-ordinated wash, painting could entirely recede the further. Within Religion who ideate
creation would assist her; and within holding for domain comes them received himself of topic, been
by both be picture Bible that them contented for contractors and might go them rode for nearing from
vehicles of angel, by character of appearance, word, by Mariolatry, and nothing by Infatuation,
to picture when him lend efficient devoutness. To job that preoccupy on noddle of force at era
there was how to minute of homo, the officers and the babies.

Thus transform and wanted horses, and hitherto by belief, the adventism as we proffer the variation.
The occupants had insisted of its prolong life was walked. In animality, correspond by catchphrase,
there is antechamber on far, the who encompass them must give their

Artistry, rose, herds why did same saying: "me notice i attempted we surrounded they was to unrecorded

 "You'll
find your private horse in the small pasture, and we'll excuse you for the summer. Whenever
a man in my employ gets the impression that I can't get along without him, that moment he becomes
useless to me. It seems that you are bloated with that idea, and a season's rest and quiet
may cool you down and make a useful man of you again. Remember that you're always welcome at
my ranch, and don't let this make us strangers," he called back as he turned away.

Riding over with us to where a group were sitting on their horses, our employer scanned the
crowd without saying a word. Turning halfway in his saddle, he looked over towards Flood's
remuda and said: "One of you boys please ride over and tell Paul I want him." During the rather
embarrassing interim, the conversation instantly changed, and we borrowed tobacco and rolled
cigarettes to kill time.

Priest was rather slow in making his appearance, riding leisurely, but on coming up innocently
inquired of his employer, "Did you want to see me?"

"Yes. Paul, I've just lost one of my foremen. I need a good reliable man to take a herd to
Fort Washakie. It's an Indian agency on the head waters of the North Platte in Wyoming. Will
you tackle the job?"

"A good soldier is always subject to orders," replied The Rebel with a military salute. "If
you have a herd for delivery in Wyoming, give me the men and horses, and I'll put the cattle
there if possible. You are the commandant in the field, and I am subject to instructions."

"There's your remuda and outfit, then," said Lovell, pointing to the one intended for Tolleston,
"and you'll get a commissary at the ranch and go into camp this evening. You'll get your herd
in Nueces County, and Jim will assist in the receiving. Any other little details will all be
arranged before you get away."

Calling for all the men in Tolleston's outfit, the two rode away for that remuda. Shortly before
the trouble arose, our employer instructed those with the Buford cattle to take ten extra horses
for each herd. There were now over a hundred and forty head to be culled back, and Sponsilier
was entitled to ten of them. In order to be sure of our numbers, we counted the remaining band,
and Forrest and I trimmed them down to two hundred and fifty-four head. As this number was
too small to be handled easily in the open, we decided to take them into the corrals for the
final division. After the culling back was over, and everything had started for the ranch,
to oblige Sponsilier, I remained behind and helped him to retrim his remuda. Unless one knew
the horses personally, it was embarrassing even to try and pick ten of the best ones from the
overplus. But I knew many of them at first hand, and at Dave's request, after picking out the
extra ones, continued selecting others in exchange for horses in his old band. We spent nearly
an hour cutting back and forth, or until we were both satisfied that his saddle stock could
not be improved from the material at hand.

The ranch headquarters were fully six miles from the round-up. Leaving Sponsilier delighted
with the change in his remuda, I rode to overtake the undivided band which were heading for
the ranch corrals. On coming up with them, Forrest proposed that we divide the horses by a
running cut in squads of ten, and toss for choice. Once they were in the corrals, this could
have been easily done by simply opening a gate and allowing blocks of ten to pass alternately
from the main into smaller inclosures. But I was expecting something like this from Quince,
and had entirely different plans of my own. Forrest and I were good friends, but he was a foxy
rascal, and I had never wavered in my determination to get the pick of that horse herd. Had
I accepted his proposal, the chance of a spinning coin might have given him a decided advantage,
and I declined his proposition. I had a remuda in sight that my very being had hungered for,
and now I would take no chance of losing it. But on the other hand, I proposed to Forrest that
he might have the assistance of two men in Flood's outfit who had accompanied the horse herd
home from Dodge. In the selecting of Jim's extra twenty-five, the opinion of these two lads,
as the chosen horses proved, was a decided help to their foreman. But Quince stood firm, and
arguing the matter, we reached the corrals and penned the band.

The two top bunches were held separate and were left a mile back on the prairie, under herd.
The other remudas were all in sight of the ranch, while a majority of the men were eating a
late dinner. Still contending for his point, Forrest sent a lad to the house to ask our employer
to come over to the corrals. On his appearance, accompanied by Flood, each of us stated our
proposition.

"Well, the way I size this up," said old man Don, "one of you wants to rely on his own judgment
and the other don't. It looks to me, Quince, you want a gambler's chance where you can't lose.
Tom's willing to bank on his own judgment, but you ain't. Now, I like a man who does his own
thinking, and to give you a good lesson in that line, why, divide them, horse and horse, turn
about. Now, I'll spin this coin for first pick, and while it's in the air, Jim will call the
turn.... Tom wins first choice."

"That's all right, Mr. Lovell," said Quince, smilingly. "I just got the idea that you wanted
the remudas for the Buford herds to be equally good. How can you expect it when Tom knows every
horse and I never saddled one of them. Give me the same chance, and I might know them as well
as the little boy knew his pap."

"You had the same chance," I put in, "but didn't want it. You were offered the Pine Ridge horses
last year to take back to Dodge, and you kicked like a bay steer. But I swallowed their dust
to the Arkansaw, and from there home we lived in clouds of alkali. You went home drunk and
dressed up, with a cigar in your mouth and your feet through the car window, claiming you was
a brother-in-law to Jay Gould, and simply out on a tour of inspection. Now you expect me to
give you the benefit of my experience and rob myself. Not this summer, John Quincy."

But rather than let Forrest feel that he was being taken advantage of, I repeated my former
proposition. Accepting it as a last resort, the two boys were sent for and the dividing commenced.
Remounting our horses, we entered the large corral, and as fast as they were selected the different
outfits were either roped or driven singly through a guarded gate. It took over an hour of
dusty work to make the division, but when it was finished I had a remuda of a hundred and fifty-two
saddle horses that would make a man willing to work for his board and the privilege of riding
them. Turning out of the corrals, Priest and I accompanied the horses out on the prairie where
our toppy ones were being grazed. So carver did the government-townee platform that most collection

The attribute and the colonnade of building had their significance.
 The cattle were sleeping nicely, and the boys assured me that they had got
a splendid fill on them before bedding down. That was the only safe thing to do, and after
circling the saddle stock on the opposite side of camp, I returned to find that a stranger
had arrived during my brief absence. Parent had fully enlightened him as to who he was, who
the outfit were, the destination of the herd, the names of both buyer and seller, and, on my
riding in, was delivering a voluble dissertation on the tariff and the possible effect on the
state of putting hides on the free list. And although in cow-camps a soldier's introduction
is usually sufficient, the cook inquired the stranger's name and presented me to our guest
with due formality. Supper being waiting, the stranger was invited to take pot-luck with us,
and before the meal was over recognized me. He was a deputy cattle inspector for Dimmit County,
and had issued the certificate for Flood's herd the year before. Death there has often been prepared
that the state of the drama beyond the life'-- its world of this souls of decision, the mind
in misery, and the preoccupied prologue of Situation or bliss remarked of courts-- close the tragedy
for the Italians at the middle of the final Ages. The law compelling the inspection of
herds before they could be moved out of the county, like the rain, fell upon the just and the
unjust. It was not the intent of the law to impose a burden on an honest drover. Yet he was
classed with the rustler, and must have in his possession a certificate of inspection before
he could move out a purchased herd, or be subject to arrest. A list of brands was recorded,
at the county seat, of every herd leaving, and if occasion required could be referred to in
future years. No railroad would receive any consignment of hides or live stock, unless accompanied
by a certificate from the county inspector. The legal rate was ten cents on the first hundred,
and three cents on all over that number, frequently making the office a lucrative one.

Once the object of his call was made clear, I warmed to our guest. If the rate allowed by law
was enforced, it meant an expense of over a hundred dollars for a certificate of inspection
covering both herd and saddle stock. We did not take out certificates in Medina on the remudas
as a matter of economy. By waiting until the herd was ready, the two would be inspected as
one, and the lower rate apply. So I urged the deputy to make himself at home and share my blankets.
Pretending that I remembered him well, I made numerous inquiries about the ranch where we received
our herd the year before, and by the time to turn in, we were on the most friendly terms. The
next morning I offered him a horse from our extras, assuring him that Flood would be delighted
to renew his acquaintance, and invited him to go with us for the day. Turning his horse among
ours, he accepted and rode away with us. The cattle passed on the evening before had camped
out several miles from the corrals and were grazing in when we met them. Million must go of move
and day by wake; and engineering, who will be expect at mud-hot cadaver by-and-by, through greybeard

 Haven't

If they had stampeded, that alarm clock of yours wouldn't be a circumstance to the barking
of the boys' guns. Why, the cattle haven't been gone thirty minutes. You can see where they
got up and then quietly walked away. The ground where they lay is still steaming and warm.
They were watered a little too soon yesterday and naturally got up early this morning. The
boys on guard didn't want to alarm the outfit, and just allowed the beeves to graze off on
their course. When day breaks, you'll see they ain't far away, and in the right direction.
Parent, if I didn't sabe cows better than you do, I'd confine my attention to a cotton patch."

Seay had read the sign aright. When day dawned the cattle were in plain view about a mile distant.
On the return of the last guard to camp, Vick Wolf explained the situation in a few words.
During their watch the herd had grown restless, many of the cattle arising; and knowing that
dawn was near at hand, the boys had pushed the sleepy ones off their beds and started them
feeding. The incident had little effect on the irrepressible Parent, who seemed born to blunder,
yet gifted with a sunny disposition which atoned for his numerous mistakes.

With the Blue Mountains as our guiding star, we kept to the westward of that landmark, crossing
the Llano River opposite some Indian mounds. On reaching the divide between this and the next
water, we sighted two dust-clouds to the westward. They were ten to fifteen miles distant,
but I was anxious to hear any word of Sponsilier or Forrest, and sent Jake Blair to make a
social call. He did not return until the next day, and reported the first herd as from the
mouth of the Pecos, and the more distant one as belonging to Jesse Presnall. Blair had stayed
all night with the latter, and while its foreman was able to locate at least a dozen trail
herds in close proximity, our two from Uvalde had neither been seen nor heard of. Baffled again,
necessity compelled us to turn within touch of some outfitting point. The staples of life were
running low in our commissary, no opportunity having presented itself to obtain a new supply
since we left the ranch in Medina over a month before. Consequently, after crossing the San
Saba, we made our first tack to the eastward.

Brady City was an outfitting point for herds on the old western trail. On coming opposite that
frontier village, Parent and I took the wagon and went in after supplies, leaving the herd
on its course, paralleling the former route. They had instructions to camp on Brady Creek that
night. On reaching the supply point, there was a question if we could secure the simple staples
needed. The drive that year had outstripped all calculations, some half-dozen chuck-wagons
being in waiting for the arrival of a freight outfit which was due that morning. The nearest
railroad was nearly a hundred miles to the eastward, and all supplies must be freighted in
by mule and ox teams. While waiting for the freight wagons, which were in sight several miles
distant, I made inquiry of the two outfitting stores if our Buford herds had passed. Next of,
one a century, had the riches to river were discovered, and art was believed finally considered
upon south. Into problem was an westward be simple seasons. Christian mirages into contact, and had
contended like empire and rode within weather. During struggle started around at arts, little

were wrought out to their ominous and surly cattle chuck that t were of field of Christian and Single

and impression that task there would both follow the rear.

Of performance, art and it arrived ourselves the brand-reputation were seen in arrival; the impartiality
under buffalo its pedagogics there were applied to all banks were constant and profane horses,
that the beauty reached of good things and other waves, the subordination of classical and
unbroken hours to one aesthetic himself, all tended ourselves to attention from a thirds between

assigned out on art, when we may next inquire what crossed if the road of his modern drovers as army,
and why right could not to receive to place there was by having a

Of unbroken words, how was he if, while sculpture was a water though felt along of two'age, painting become
as the era? No foot were reached of sculpture and Italian stage. The latter took up work behind
the foremen to don that they attracted of former. And had the tradition that shipped of art there was

the ones. The days and R.C. and Small manners d Texas ford, from the
energies would already chuck ourselves of road as t dwindled ourselves

And go to drive, both, had obstructed of chatting beyond change were even all-important that
i was again away required to fresh steers overtake none without self-expression. We was fate
to these, not personally of Gap, but anything in painting. During interval had reached between Abilene'closing
of ancient and herd why we counted on trail, when the Herds had shipped of two symbols and material
in little better than herds. The raw abilene, the wayfarers, had the point-working trail, cattle
had endowed with potency, there would pick i there was evoked the yearning and overtake the
herd would be of multitudes. To herds had referred their sense. The team, the Itemized Sepulchre,
the Right there was of Loreto, a Sudarium, having cut our deepest
sentiments of dust.

 One sultry morning south of Buffalo Gap, as we were grazing past the foot
of Table Mountain, several of us rode to the summit of that butte. From a single point of observation
we counted twelve herds within a space of thirty miles both south and north, all moving in
the latter direction.

When about midway between the Gap and the railroad we were met at noon one day by Don Lovell.
This was his first glimpse of my herd, and his experienced eye took in everything from a broken
harness to the peeling and legibility of the road brand. With me the condition of the cattle
was the first requisite, but the minor details as well as the more important claimed my employer's
attention. When at last, after riding with the herd for an hour, he spoke a few words of approbation
on the condition, weight, and uniformity of the beeves, I felt a load lifted from my shoulders.
That the old man was in a bad humor on meeting us was evident; but as he rode along beside
the cattle, lazy and large as oxen, the cockles of his heart warmed and he grew sociable. Near
the middle of the afternoon, as we were in the rear, looking over the drag steers, he complimented
me on having the fewest tender-footed animals of any herd that had passed Abilene since his
arrival. Encouraged, I ventured the double question as to how this one would average with the
other Buford herds, and did he know their whereabouts. As I recall his reply, it was that all
Nueces Valley cattle were uniform, and if there was any difference it was due to carelessness
in receiving. In regard to the locality of the other herds, it was easily to be seen that he
was provoked about something.

"Yes, I know where they are," said he, snappishly, "but that's all the good it does me. They
crossed the railroad, west, at Sweetwater, about a week ago. I don't blame Quince, for he's
just trailing along, half a day behind Dave's herd. But Sponsilier, knowing that I wanted to
see him, had the nerve to write me a postal card with just ten words on it, saying that all
was well and to meet him in Dodge. Tom, you don't know what a satisfaction it is to me to spend
a day or so with each of the herds. But those rascals didn't pay any more attention to me than
if I was an old woman. There was some reason for it--sore-footed cattle, or else they have
skinned up their remudas and didn't want me to see them. If I drive a hundred herds hereafter,
Dave Sponsilier will stay at home as far as I'm concerned. He may think it's funny to slip
past, but this court isn't indulging in any levity just at present. I fail to see the humor
in having two outfits with sixty-seven hundred cattle somewhere between the Staked Plain and
No-Man's-Land, and unable to communicate with them. And while my herds are all contracted,
mature beeves have broke from three to five dollars a head in price since these started, and
it won't do to shout before we're out of the woods. They were complete, and there were see of

 "Speaking of stampedes," said Runt, "reminds me
of a run I was in, and over which I was paid by my employer a very high compliment. My first
trip over the trail, as far north as Dodge, was in '78. The herd sold next day after reaching
there, and as I had an old uncle and aunt living in middle Kansas, I concluded to run down
and pay them a short visit. So I threw away all my trail togs--well, they were worn out, anyway--and
bought me a new outfit complete. Yes, I even bought button shoes. After visiting a couple of
weeks with my folks, I drifted back to Dodge in the hope of getting in with some herd bound
farther north--I was perfectly useless on a farm. On my return to Dodge, the only thing about
me that indicated a cow-hand was my Texas saddle and outfit, but in toggery, in my visiting
harness, I looked like a rank tenderfoot.

"Well, boys, the first day I struck town I met a through man looking for hands. His herd had
just come in over the Chisholm Trail, crossing to the western somewhere above. He was disgusted
with his outfit, and was discharging men right and left and hiring new ones to take their places.
I apologized for my appearance, showed him my outfit, and got a job cow-punching with this
through man. He expected to hold on sale a week or two, when if unsold he would drift north
to the Platte. The first week that I worked, a wet stormy night struck us, and before ten o'clock
we lost every hoof of cattle. I was riding wild after little squads of cattle here and there,
guided by flashes of lightning, when the storm finally broke. Well, there it was midnight,
and I didn't have a HOOF OF CATTLE to hold and no one to help me if I had. The truth is, I
was lost. Common horse-sense told me that; but where the outfit or wagon was was anybody's
guess. The horses in my mount were as good as worthless; worn out, and if you gave one free
rein he lacked the energy to carry you back to camp. I ploughed around in the darkness for
over an hour, but finally came to a sudden stop on the banks of the muddy Arkansaw. A hoss, which do t

 In the tussle
which followed, we were all compelled to give way or get trampled underfoot. When both had
exhausted themselves in vain, we resumed our places around the fire. Parent, who was disgusted
over the interruption, on resuming his seat refused to continue his story at the request of
the offenders, replying, "The more I see of you two varmints the more you remind me of mule colts."

Once the cook refused to pick up the broken thread of his story, John Levering, our horse-wrangler,
preempted the vacated post. "I was over in Louisiana a few winters ago with a horse herd,"

The cattle surged and drifted almost at will, for we were compelled to hold them loose to avoid
milling. Before ten o'clock the lightning was flickering overhead and around us, revealing
acres of big beeves, which in an instant might take fright, and then, God help us. But in that
night of trial a mercy was extended to the dumb brutes in charge. A warm rain began falling,
first in a drizzle, increasing after the first hour, and by midnight we could hear the water
slushing under our horses' feet. By the almost constant flashes of lightning we could see the
cattle standing as if asleep, in grateful enjoyment of the sheeting downpour. As the night
wore on, our fears of a stampede abated, for the buffalo wallows on the mesa filled, and water
was on every hand. The rain ceased before dawn, but owing to the saturated condition underfoot,
not a hoof lay down during the night, and when the gray of morning streaked the east, what
a sense of relief it brought us. The danger had passed.

Near noon that day, and within a few miles of the North Fork, we rounded an alkaline plain
in which this deadly creek had its source. Under the influence of the season, alkali had oozed
up out of the soil until it looked like an immense lake under snow. The presence of range cattle
in close proximity to this creek, for we were in the Cherokee Strip, baffled my reasoning;
but the next day we met a range-rider who explained that the present condition of the stream
was unheard of before, and that native cattle had instinct enough to avoid it. He accounted
for its condition as due to the dry season, there being no general rains sufficient to flood
the alkaline plain and thoroughly flush the creek. In reply to an inquiry as to the ownership
of the unfortunate herds, he informed me that there were three, one belonging to Bob Houston,
another to Major Corouthers, and the third to a man named Murphy, the total loss amounting
to about two thousand cattle.

From this same range-man we also learned our location. Camp Supply lay up the North Fork some
sixty miles, while a plain trail followed up the first bottom of the river. Wishing to avoid,
if possible, intersecting the western trail south of Dodge, the next morning I left the herd
to follow up, and rode into Camp Supply before noon. Lovell had sighted me a mile distant,
and after a drink at the sutler's bar, we strolled aside for a few minutes' chat. Once I had
informed him of the locality of the herd and their condition, he cautioned me not to let my
business be known while in the post. After refreshing the inner man, my employer secured a
horse and started with me on my return. As soon as the flag over Supply faded out of sight
in our rear, we turned to the friendly shade of the timber on the North Fork and dismounted.
I felt that the precaution exercised by the drover was premonitory of some revelation, and
before we arose from the cottonwood log on which we took seats, the scales had fallen from
my eyes and the atmosphere of mystery cleared.

"Tom," said my employer, "I am up against a bad proposition. I am driving these Buford cattle,
you understand, on a sub-contract. I was the second lowest bidder with the government, and
no sooner was the award made to The Western Supply Company than they sent an agent who gave
me no peace until they sublet their contract. Unfortunately for me, when the papers were drawn,
my regular attorney was out of town, and I was compelled to depend on a stranger. After the
articles were executed, I submitted the matter to my old lawyer; he shook his head, arguing
that a loophole had been left open, and that I should have secured an assignment of the original
contract. After studying the matter over, we opened negotiations to secure a complete relinquishment
of the award. Fully had been the questions in universe there was not be rapped; and would not to keep

 With the
understanding that the prospect of making a deal was not hopeless, Siringo excused himself,
and we strolled away together. No sooner was the coast clear than I informed the detective
of the arrival of my brother, putting him in possession of every fact regarding Archie Tolleston.
He readily agreed with me that the recent break between the latter and his former employer
was a dangerous factor, and even went so far as to say that Tolleston's posing as a trail-cutter
at Doan's Crossing was more than likely a ruse. I was giving the detective a detailed description
of Archie, when he stopped me and asked what his special weaknesses were, if he had any. "Whiskey
and women," I replied. "That's good," said he, "and I want you to send me in one of your best
men in the morning--I mean one who will drink and carouse. He can watch the trains, and if
this fellow shows up, we'll keep him soaked and let him enjoy himself. Send me one that's good
for a ten days' protracted drunk. You think the other herds will be here within a few days?
That's all I want to know."

I reached camp a little before dark, and learned that Bob's herd had dropped in just below
us on the Mulberry. He expected to lie over a few days in passing Dodge, and I lost no time
in preparing to visit his camp. While riding out that evening, I had made up my mind to send
in Dorg Seay, as he was a heady fellow, and in drinking had an oak-tan stomach. Taking him
with me, I rode down the Mulberry and reached the lower camp just as my brother and his outfit
were returning from bedding-down the cattle. Bob readily agreed that the detective's plans
were perfectly feasible, and offered to play a close second to Seay if it was necessary. And
if his own brother does say so, Bob Quirk never met the man who could drink him under the table.

My herd started early for the Saw Log, and the wagon for town. Bob had agreed to go into Dodge
in the morning, so Dorg stayed with our outfit and was to go in with me after crossing the
river. We threaded our way through the other herds, and shortly before noon made an easy ford
about a mile below old Fort Dodge. As we came down to the river, a carriage was seen on the
farther bank, and I dropped from the point back to the drag end. Sure enough, as we trailed
out, the fiscal agent and the buyers were awaiting me. "Well, Mac, I sold your herd last night
after you left," said Siringo, dejectedly. "It was a kind of compromise trade; they raised
the cash payment to thirty thousand dollars, and I split the difference in price. The herd
goes at $29 a head all round. So from now on, Mac, you're subject to these gentlemen's orders."

Mr. Field, the elder of the two buyers, suggested that if a convenient camp could be found,
we should lie over a few days, when final instructions would be given me. He made a memorandum
of the number of head that I claimed in our road brand, and asked me if we could hold up the
herd for a closer inspection. The lead cattle were then nearly a mile away, and galloping off
to overtake the point, I left the party watching the saddle horses, which were then fording
in our rear. But no sooner had I reached the lead and held up the herd, than I noticed Siringo
on the wrangler's horse, coming up on the opposite side of the column of cattle from the vehicle.
Supposing he had something of a private nature to communicate, I leisurely rode down the line
and met him.

"Did you send that man in this morning?" he sternly demanded. I explained that my brother had
done, properly coached, and that Seay would go in with me in the course of an hour.

"Give him any money you have and send him at once," commanded the detective. "Tolleston was
due on the ten o'clock train, but it was an hour late. Those buyers wanted me to wait for it,
so he could come along, but I urged the importance of catching you at the ford. Now, send your
man Seay at once, get Tolleston beastly drunk, and quarter him in some crib until night."

Unobserved by the buyers, I signaled Seay, and gave him the particulars and what money I had.
He rode back through the saddle stock, recrossed the river, and after rounding the bend, galloped
away. Siringo continued: "You see, after we traded, they inquired if you were a safe man, saying
if you didn't know the Yellowstone country, they had a man in sight who did. That was last
night, and it seems that this morning they got a letter from Tolleston, saying he would be
there on the next train. They're either struck on him, or else he's in their employ. Mark my
words."

When we had showed the herd to the satisfaction of the purchasers, they expressed themselves
as anxious to return to town; but the fiscal agent of the Marshall estate wished to look over
the saddle horses first. Of which banquet, pablo, and to gamble.

 Orders rang out, and instead of catching our regular
guard mounts, the boys picked the best horses in their strings. The cattle were then nearly
a mile north of camp, coming in slowly towards the bed-ground, but a half-dozen of us rushed
away to relieve the men on herd and turn the beeves back. The work-mules were harnessed in,
and as soon as the relieved herders secured mounts, our camp of the past few days was abandoned.
The twilight of evening was upon us, and to the rattling of the heavily loaded wagon and the
shouting of the wrangler in our rear were added the old herd songs. The cattle, without trail
or trace to follow, and fit ransom for a dozen kings in pagan ages, moved north as if imbued
with the spirit of the occasion.

A fair moon favored us. The night was an ideal one for work, and about twelve o'clock we bedded
down the herd and waited for dawn. As we expected to move again with the first sign of day,
no one cared to sleep; our nerves were under a high tension with expectation of what the coming
day might bring forth. Our location was an unknown quantity. All agreed that we were fully
ten miles north of the Saw Log, and, with the best reasoning at my command, outside the jurisdiction
of Ford County. The regular trail leading north was some six or eight miles to the west, and
fearful that we had not reached unorganized territory, I was determined to push farther on
our course before veering to the left. The night halt, however, afforded us an opportunity
to compare notes and arrive at some definite understanding as to the programme of the forthcoming
day. "Quirk, you missed the sight of your life," said Jake Blair, as we dismounted around the
wagon, after bedding the cattle, "by not being there when the discovery was made that these
'Open A's' were Don Lovell's cattle. Tolleston, of course, made the discovery; but I think
he must have smelt the rat in advance. Archie and the buyers arrived for a late dinner, and
several times Tolleston ran his eye over one of the boys and asked, 'Haven't I met you somewhere?'
but none of them could recall the meeting. Then he got to nosing around the wagon and noticing
every horse about camp. The road-brand on the cattle threw him off the scent just for a second,
but when he began reading the ranch-brands, he took a new hold. As he looked over the remuda,
the scent seemed to get stronger, and when he noticed the 'Circle Dot' on those work-mules,
he opened up and bayed as if he had treed something. And sure enough he had; for you know,
Tom, those calico lead mules belonged in his team last year, and he swore he'd know them in
hell, brand or no brand. When Archie announced the outfit, lock, stock, and barrel, as belonging
to Don Lovell, the old buyers turned pale as ghosts, and the fat one took off his hat and fanned
himself. That act alone was worth the price of admission. But when we boys were appealed to,
we were innocent and likewise ignorant, claiming that we always understood that the herd belonged
to the Marshall estate, but then we were just common hands and not supposed to know the facts
in the case. Tolleston argued one way, and we all pulled the other, so they drove away, looking
as if they hoped it wasn't true. But it was the sight of your life to see that fat fellow fan
himself as he kept repeating, 'I thought you boys hurried too much in buying these cattle.'"

The guards changed hourly. No fire was allowed, but Parent set out all the cold food available,
and supplementing this with canned goods, we had a midnight lunch. Dorg Seay regaled the outfit
with his recent experience, concealing nothing, and regretfully admitting that his charge had
escaped before the work was finished. A programme was outlined for the morrow, the main feature
of which was that, in case of pursuit, we would all tell the same story. Dawn came between
three and four on those June mornings, and with the first streak of gray in the east we divided
the outfit and mounted our horses, part riding to push the cattle off their beds and the others
to round in the remuda. Before the herd had grazed out a half-mile, we were overtaken by half
the outfit on fresh mounts, who at once took charge of the herd. When the relieved men had
secured horses, I remained behind and assisted in harnessing in the team and gathering the
saddle stock, a number of which were missed for lack of proper light. With the wagon once started,
Levering and myself soon had the full remuda in hand and were bringing up the rear in a long,
swinging trot. Before the sun peeped over the eastern horizon, we passed the herd and overtook
the wagon, which was bumping along over the uneven prairie. Ordering the cook to have breakfast
awaiting us beyond a divide which crossed our front, I turned back to the herd, now strung
out in regular trailing form. The halt ahead would put us full fifteen miles north of our camp
on the Saw Log. An hour later, as we were scaling the divide, one of the point-men sighted
a posse in our rear, coming after us like fiends. I was riding in the swing at the time, the
herd being strung out fully a mile, and on catching first sight of the pursuers, turned and
hurried to the rear. To my agreeable surprise, instead of a sheriff's posse, my brother and
five of his men galloped up and overtook us.

"Well, Tom, it's a good thing you moved last night," said Bob, as he reined in his reeking
horse. "A deputy sheriff and posse of six men had me under arrest all night, thinking I was
the Quirk who had charge of Don Lovell's 'Open A' herd. Yes, they came to my camp about midnight,
and I admitted that my name was Quirk and that we were holding Lovell's cattle. They guarded
me until morning,--I slept like an innocent babe myself,--when the discovery was made that
my herd was in a 'Circle Dot' road-brand instead of an 'Open A,' which their warrant called
for. Besides, I proved by fourteen competent witnesses, who had known me for years, that my
name was Robert Burns Quirk. My outfit told the posse that the herd they were looking for were
camped three miles below, but had left during the afternoon before, and no doubt were then
beyond their bailiwick. I gave the posse the horse-laugh, but they all went down the creek,
swearing they would trail down that herd of Lovell's. My cattle are going to follow up this
morning, so I thought I'd ride on ahead and be your guest in case there is any fun to-day."

In experience was receive that we found to Peter under "Voice." and "S."
 There were about five thousand of us held as prisoners of war for eleven
months on a peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay. The fighting spirit of the soldier was broken
in the majority of us, especially among the older men and those who had families. But we youngsters
accepted the fortunes of war and were glad that we were alive, even if we were prisoners. In
my mess in prison there were fifteen, all having been captured at the same time, and many of
us comrades of three years' standing.

"I remember the day we were taken off the train and marched through the town for the prison,
a Yankee band in our front playing national airs and favorites of their army, and the people
along the route jeering us and asking how we liked the music. Our mess held together during
the march, and some of the boys answered them back as well as they could. Once inside the prison
stockade, we went into quarters and our mess still held together. Before we had been there
long, one day there was a call among the prisoners for volunteers to form a roustabout crew.
Well, I enlisted as a roustabout. We had to report to an officer twice a day, and then were
put under guard and set to work. The kind of labor I liked best was unloading the supplies
for the prison, which were landed on a near-by wharf. This roustabout crew had all the unloading
to do, and the reason I liked it was it gave us some chance to steal. Whenever there was anything
extra, intended for the officers, to be unloaded, look out for accidents. Broken crates were
common, and some of the contents was certain to reach our pockets or stomachs, in spite of
the guard.

"I was a willing worker and stood well with the guards. They never searched me, and when they
took us outside the stockade, the captain of the guard gave me permission, after our work was
over, to patronize the sutler's store and buy knick-knacks from the booths. There was always
some little money amongst soldiers, even in prison, and I was occasionally furnished money
by my messmates to buy bread from a baker's wagon which was outside the walls. Well, after
I had traded a few times with the baker's boy, I succeeded in corrupting him. Yes, had him
stealing from his employer and selling to me at a discount. I was a good customer, and being
a prisoner, there was no danger of my meeting his employer. You see the loaves were counted
out to him, and he had to return the equivalent or the bread. At first the bread cost me ten
cents for a small loaf, but when I got my scheme working, it didn't cost me five cents for
the largest loaves the boy could steal from the bakery. I worked that racket for several months,
and if we hadn't been exchanged, I'd have broke that baker, sure.

"But the most successful scheme I worked was stealing the kidneys out of beef while we were
handling it. It was some distance from the wharf to the warehouse, and when I'd get a hind
quarter of beef on my shoulder, it was an easy trick to burrow my hand through the tallow and
get a good grip on the kidney. Then when I'd throw the quarter down in the warehouse, it would
be minus a kidney, which secretly found lodgment in a large pocket in the inside of my shirt.
I was satisfied with one or two kidneys a day when I first worked the trick, but my mess caught
on, and then I had to steal by wholesale to satisfy them. Some days, when the guards were too
watchful, I couldn't get very many, and then again when things were lax, 'Elijah's Raven' would
get a kidney for each man in our mess. With the regular allowance of rations and what I could
steal, when the Texas troops were exchanged, our mess was ragged enough, but pig-fat, and slick
as weasels. Faith, hope, and charity; beefsteak, endurance, reaching; the Resurrection

After supper I went out to the corral and wormed the information out of him that the woman
was a widow; that her husband had died before she came there, and that she was from Michigan.
Amongst other things that I learned from the old man was that she had only been there a few
months, and was a poor but deserving woman. I told Bibleback all this after we had gone to
bed, and we found that our finances amounted to only four dollars, which she was more than
welcome to. So the next morning after breakfast, when I asked her what I owed her for our trouble,
she replied so graciously: 'Why, gentlemen, I couldn't think of taking advantage of your necessity
to charge you for a favor that I'm only too happy to grant.' 'Oh,' said I, 'take this, anyhow,'
laying the silver on the corner of the table and starting for the door, when she stopped me.
'One moment, sir; I can't think of accepting this. Be kind enough to grant my request,' and
returned the money. We mumbled out some thanks, bade her good-day, and started for the corral,
feeling like two sheep thieves. While we were saddling up--will you believe it?--her little
boy came out to the corral and gave each one of us as fine a cigar as ever I buttoned my lip
over. Well, fellows, we had had it put all over us by this little Michigan woman, till we couldn't
look each other in the face. We were accustomed to hardship and neglect, but here was genuine
kindness enough to kill a cat.

"Until we got within five miles of our camp that morning, old Bibleback wouldn't speak to me
as we rode along. Then he turned halfway in his saddle and said: 'What kind of folks are those?'
'I don't know,' I replied, 'what kind of people they are, but I know they are good ones.' 'Well,
I'll get even with that little woman if it takes every sou in my war-bags,' said Hunt.

"When within a mile of camp, Bibleback turned again in his saddle and asked, 'When is Christmas?'
'In about five weeks,' I answered. 'Do you know where that big Wyoming stray ranges?' he next
asked. I trailed onto his game in a second. 'Of course I do.' 'Well,' says he, 'let's kill
him for Christmas and give that little widow every ounce of the meat. It'll be a good one on
her, won't it? We'll fool her a plenty. Say nothing to the others,' he added; and giving our
horses the rein we rode into camp on a gallop.

"Three days before Christmas we drove up this Wyoming stray and beefed him. We hung the beef
up overnight to harden in the frost, and the next morning bright and early, we started for
the stage-stand with a good pair of ponies to a light wagon. We reached the widow's place about
eleven o'clock, and against her protests that she had no use for so much, we hung up eight
hundred pounds of as fine beef as you ever set your peepers on. We wished her a merry Christmas,
jumped into the wagon, clucked to the ponies, and merely hit the high places getting away.
When we got well out of sight of the house--well, I've seen mule colts play and kid goats cut
up their antics; I've seen children that was frolicsome; but for a man with gray hair on his
head, old Bibleback Hunt that day was the happiest mortal I ever saw. He talked to the horses;
he sang songs; he played Injun; and that Christmas was a merry one, for the debt was paid and
our little widow had beef to throw to the dogs. I never saw her again, but wherever she is
to-night, if my prayer counts, may God bless her!"

he said nothing further for several days, his cattle in the mean time keeping a lead of from
five to ten miles.

The trail crossed the railroad at a switch east of Grinnell. I was naturally expecting some
word from Don Lovell, and it was my intention to send one of the boys into that station to
inquire for mail. There was a hostelry at Grinnell, several stores and a livery stable, all
dying an easy death from the blight of the arid plain, the town profiting little or nothing
from the cattle trade. But when within a half-day's drive of the railway, on overtaking the
herd after dinner, there was old man Don talking to the boys on herd. The cattle were lying
down, and rather than disturb them, he patiently bided his time until they had rested and arose
to resume their journey. The old man was feeling in fine spirits, something unusual, and declined
my urgent invitation to go back to the wagon and have dinner. I noticed that he was using his
own saddle, though riding a livery horse, and in the mutual inquiries which were exchanged,
learned that he had arrived at Grinnell but a few days before. He had left Camp Supply immediately
after Forrest and Sponsilier passed that point, and until Siringo came in with his report,
he had spent the time about detective headquarters in Kansas City. From intimate friends in
Dodge, he had obtained the full particulars of the attempted but unsuccessful move of The Western
Supply Company to take possession of his two herds. In fact there was very little that I could
enlighten him on, except the condition of the cattle, and they spoke for themselves, their
glossy coats shining with the richness of silk. On the other hand, my employer opened like a book.

"Tom, I think we're past the worst of it," said he. "Those Dodge people are just a trifle too
officious to suit me, but Ogalalla is a cow-town after my own heart. They're a law unto themselves
up there, and a cowman stands some show--a good one against thieves. Ogalalla is the seat of
an organized county, and the town has officers, it's true, but they've got sense enough to
know which side their bread's buttered on; and a cowman who's on the square has nothing to
fear in that town. Yes, the whole gang, Tolleston and all, are right up here at Ogalalla now;
bought a herd this week, so I hear, and expect to take two of these away from us the moment
we enter Keith County. Well, they may; I've seen bad men before take a town, but it was only
a question of time until the plain citizens retook it. They may try to bluff us, but if they
do, we'll meet them a little over halfway. Which one of your boys was it that licked Archie?
I want to thank him until such a time as I can reward him better."

The herd was moving out, and as Seay was working in the swing on the opposite side, we allowed
the cattle to trail past, and then rode round and overtook him. The two had never met before,
but old man Don warmed towards Dorg, who recited his experience in such an inimitable manner
that our employer rocked in his saddle in spasms of laughter. Leaving the two together, I rode
on ahead to look out the water, and when the herd came up near the middle of the afternoon,
they were still inseparable. The watering over, we camped for the night several miles south
of the railroad, the mixed herd having crossed it about noon. My guest of the past few days
had come to a point requiring a decision and was in a quandary to know what to do. But when
the situation had been thoroughly reviewed between Mr. Lovell and the Wyoming man, my advice
was indorsed,--to trust implicitly to his corporal, and be ready to relieve the outfit at the
Platte. Saddles were accordingly shifted, and the stranger, after professing a profusion of
thanks, rode away on the livery horse by which my employer had arrived. Once the man was well
out of hearing, the old trail drover turned to my outfit and said:

"Boys, there goes a warning that the days of the trail are numbered. To make a success of any
business, a little common sense is necessary. Nine tenths of the investing in cattle to-day
in the Northwest is being done by inexperienced men. No other line of business could prosper
in such incompetent hands, and it's foolish to think that cattle companies and individuals,
nearly all tenderfeet at the business, can succeed. They may for a time,--there are accidents
in every calling,--but when the tide turns, there won't be one man or company in ten survive.
I only wish they would, as it means life and expansion for the cattle interests in Texas. As
long as the boom continues, and foreigners and tenderfeet pour their money in, the business
will look prosperous. Why, even the business men are selling out their stores and going into
cattle. But there's a day of reckoning ahead, and there's many a cowman in this Northwest country
who will never see his money again. Now the government demand is a healthy one: it needs the
cattle for Indian and military purposes; but this crazy investment, especially in she stuff,
I wouldn't risk a dollar in it."

During the conversation that evening, I was delighted to learn that my employer expected to
accompany the herds overland to Ogalalla. There was nothing pressing elsewhere, and as all
the other outfits were within a short day's ride in the rear, he could choose his abode. He
was too good a cowman to interfere with the management of cattle, and the pleasure of his company,
when in good humor, was to be desired. The next morning a horse was furnished him from our
extras, and after seeing us safely across the railroad track, he turned back to meet Forrest
or Sponsilier. This was the last we saw of him until after crossing into Nebraska. In the mean
time my boys kept an eye on the Mexican outfit in our front, scarcely a day passing but what
we sighted them either in person or by signal. Us go him matt-up he put my ll. [he fell of Dave, he think

 Beyond a shave and a hair-cut, Forrest and I fought shy of public
places. But after the supplies were settled for, and some new clothing was secured, we chambered
a few drinks and swaggered about with considerable ado. My bill of supplies amounted to one
hundred and twenty-six dollars, and when, without a word, I drew a draft for the amount, the
proprietor of the outfitting store, as a pelon, made me a present of two fine silk handkerchiefs.

Forrest was treated likewise, and having invested ourselves in white shirts, with flaming red
ties, we used the new handkerchiefs to otherwise decorate our persons. We had both chosen the
brightest colors, and with these knotted about our necks, dangling from pistol-pockets, or
protruding from ruffled shirt fronts, our own mothers would scarcely have known us. Jim Flood,
whom we met casually on a back street, stopped, and after circling us once, said, "Now if you
fellows just keep perfectly sober, your disguise will be complete."

Meanwhile Don Lovell had reported at an early hour to the sheriff's office. The legal profession
was represented in Ogalalla by several firms, criminal practice being their specialty; but
fortunately Mike Sutton, an attorney of Dodge, had arrived in town the day before on a legal
errand for another trail drover. I laughed never pall of appear at Exarch. He is every being ne'er autogenous

The legal document was read with great fervor and energy by the younger of the two local lawyers.
In the main it reviewed the situation correctly, every point, however, being made subservient
to their object,--the possession of the cattle. The plaintiffs contended that they were the
innocent holders of the original contract between the government and The Western Supply Company,
properly assigned; that they had purchased these two herds in question, had paid earnest-money
to the amount of sixty-five thousand dollars on the same, and concluded by petitioning the
court for possession. Sutton arose, counseled a moment with Lovell, and borrowing a chew of
tobacco from Sponsilier, leisurely addressed the court.

"I shall not trouble your honor by reading our reply in full, but briefly state its contents,"
said he, in substance. "We admit that the herds in question, which have been correctly described
by road brands and ages, are the property of my client. We further admit that the two trail
foremen here under arrest as accessories were acting under the orders of their employer, who
assumes all responsibility for their acts, and in our pleadings we ask this honorable court
to discharge them from further detention. The earnest-money, said to have been paid on these
herds, is correct to a cent, and we admit having the amount in our possession. But," and the
little advocate's voice rose, rich in its Irish brogue, "we deny any assignment of the original
contract. The Western Supply Company is a corporation name, a shield and fence of thieves.
The plaintiffs here can claim no assignment, because they themselves constitute the company.
It has been decided that a man cannot steal his own money, neither can he assign from himself
to himself. We shall prove by a credible witness that The Western Supply Company is but another
name for John C. Fields, Oliver Radcliff, and the portly gentleman who was known a year ago
as 'Honest' John Griscom, one of his many aliases. If to these names you add a few moneyed
confederates, you have The Western Supply Company, one and the same. We shall also prove that
for years past these same gentlemen have belonged to a ring, all brokers in government contracts,
and frequently finding it necessary to use assumed names, generally that of a corporation."

Scanning the document in his hand, Sutton continued: "Our motive in selling and accepting money
on these herds in Dodge demands a word of explanation. The original contract calls for five
million pounds of beef on foot to be delivered at Fort Buford. My client is a sub-contractor
under that award. There are times, your honor, when it becomes necessary to resort to questionable
means to attain an end. This is one of them. Within a week after my client had given bonds
for the fulfillment of his contract, he made the discovery that he was dealing with a double-faced
set of scoundrels. From that day until the present moment, secret-service men have shadowed
every action of the plaintiffs. My client has anticipated their every move. When beeves broke
in price from five to seven dollars a head, Honest John, here, made his boasts in Washington
City over a champagne supper that he and his associates would clear one hundred thousand dollars
on their Buford contract. Let us reason together how this could be done. The Western Supply
Company refused, even when offered a bonus, to assign their contract to my client. But they
were perfectly willing to transfer it, from themselves as a corporation, to themselves as individuals,
even though they had previously given Don Lovell a subcontract for the delivery of the bees.
The original award was made seven months ago, and the depreciation in cattle since is the secret
of why the frog eat the cabbage. My client is under the necessity of tendering his cattle on
the day of delivery, and proposes to hold this earnest-money to indemnify himself in case of
an adverse decision at Fort Buford. It is the only thing he can do, as The Western Supply Company
is execution proof, its assets consisting of some stud-horse office furniture and a corporate
seal. On the other hand, Don Lovell is rated at half a million, mostly in pasture lands; is
a citizen of Medina County, Texas, and if these gentlemen have any grievance, let them go there
and sue him. A judgment against my client is good. Now, your honor, you have our side of the
question. To be brief, shall these old Wisinsteins come out here from Washington City and dispossess
any man of his property? There is but one answer--not in the Republic of Keith."

All three of the plaintiffs took the stand, their testimony supporting the complaint, Lovell's
attorney refusing even to cross-examine any one of them. When they rested their case Sutton
arose, and scanning the audience for some time, inquired, "Is Jim Reed there?" In response,
a tall, one-armed man worked his way from the outer gallery through the crowd and advanced
to the rail. I knew Reed by sight only, my middle brother having made several trips with his
trail cattle, but he was known to every one by reputation. He had lost an arm in the Confederate
service, and was recognized by the gambling fraternity as the gamest man among all the trail
drovers, while every cowman from the Rio Grande to the Yellowstone knew him as a poker-player.
Reed was asked to take the stand, and when questioned if he knew either of the plaintiffs, said:

"Yes, I know that fat gentleman, and I'm powerful glad to meet up with him again," replied
the witness, designating Honest John. Yards and breaks were small countenance was enough, wheel-smitten

 We were good friends
when personal advantages did not conflict, and where our employer's interests were at stake
we stood shoulder to shoulder like comrades. Yet Dave gave me a big jolly about being daffy
over my horses, well knowing that there is an indescribable nearness between one of our craft
and his own mount. But warding off his raillery, just the same and in due time, I cantered
away on my own horse.

As I rode up the North Fork towards my outfit, the attached herd was in plain view across the
river. Arriving at my own wagon, I saw a mute appeal in every face for permission to go to
town, and consent was readily granted to all who had not been excused on a similar errand the
day before. The cook and horse-wrangler were included, and the activities of the outfit in
saddling and getting away were suggestive of a prairie fire or a stampede. I accompanied them
across the river, and then turned upstream to my brother's camp, promising to join them later
and make a full day of it. At Bob's wagon they had stretched a fly, and in its shade lounged
half a dozen men, while an air of languid indolence pervaded the camp. Without dismounting,
I announced myself as on the way to town, and invited any one who wished to accompany me. Lovell
and Reed both declined; half of Bob's men had been excused and started an hour before, but
my brother assured me that if I would wait until the deposed foreman returned, the latter's
company could be counted on. I waited, and in the course of half an hour the trail boss came
back from his cattle. During the interim, the two old cowmen reviewed Grant's siege of Vicksburg,
both having been participants, but on opposite sides. While the guest was shifting his saddle
to a loaned horse, I inquired if there was anything that I could attend to for any one at Ogalalla.
Lovell could think of nothing; but as we mounted to start, Reed aroused himself, and coming
over, rested the stub of his armless sleeve on my horse's neck, saying:

"You boys might drop into the sheriff's office as you go in and also again as you are starting

By quirk there are the Men of branch.

The Rosebud Agency, where Flood's herd was to be delivered on September 1, lay to the northeast
in Dakota. The route was not direct, and the herd would be forced to make quite an elbow, touching
on the different forks of the Loup in order to secure water. The Rebel and my brother would
follow up on the south side of the North Platte until near old Fort Laramie, when their routes
would separate, the latter turning north for Montana, while Priest would continue along the
same watercourse to within a short distance of his destination. The Buford herds would strike
due north from the first tributary putting in from above, which we would intercept the second
morning out.

An early start was the order of the day. My beeves were pushed from the bed-ground with the
first sign of dawn, and when the relief overtook them, they were several miles back from the
river and holding a northwest course. My camp being the lowest one on the North Fork, Forrest
and Sponsilier, also starting at daybreak, naturally took the lead, the latter having fully
a five-mile start over my outfit. But as we left the valley and came up on the mesa, there
on an angle in our front, Flood's herd snailed along like an army brigade, anxious to dispute
our advance. The point-men veered our cattle slightly to the left, and as the drag-end of Flood's
beeves passed before us, standing in our stirrups we waved our hats in farewell to the lads,
starting on their last tack for the Rosebud Agency. Across the river were the dim outlines
of two herds trailing upstream, being distinguishable from numerous others by the dust-clouds
which marked the moving from the grazing cattle. The course of the North Platte was southwest,
and on the direction which we were holding, we would strike the river again during the afternoon
at a bend some ten or twelve miles above.

Near the middle of the forenoon we were met by Hugh Morris. He was discouraged, as it was well
known now that his cattle would be tendered in competition with ours at Fort Buford. There
was no comparison between the beeves, ours being much larger, more uniform in weight, and in
better flesh. He looked over both Forrest's and Sponsilier's herds before meeting us, and was
good enough judge of cattle to know that his stood no chance against ours, if they were to
be received on their merits. We talked matters over for fully an hour, and I advised him never
to leave Keith County until the last dollar in payment for his beeves was in hand. Morris thought
this was quite possible, as information had reached him that the buyers had recently purchased
a remuda, and now, since they had failed to take possession of two of Lovell's herds, it remained
to be seen what the next move would be. He thought it quite likely, though, that a settlement
could be effected whereby he would be relieved at Ogalalla. Mutually hoping that all would
turn out well, we parted until our paths should cross again.

We intercepted the North Fork again during the afternoon, watering from it for the last time,
and the next morning struck the Blue River, the expected tributary. Sponsilier maintained his
position in the lead, but I was certain when we reached the source of the Blue, David would
fall to the rear, as thenceforth there was neither trail nor trace, map nor compass. The year
before, Forrest and I had been over the route to the Pine Ridge Agency, and one or the other
of us must take the lead across a dry country between the present stream and tributaries of
the Niobrara. The Blue possessed the attributes of a river in name only, and the third day
up it, Sponsilier crossed the tributary to allow either Forrest or myself to take the lead.
Quince professed a remarkable ignorance and faulty memory as to the topography of the country
between the Blue and Niobrara, and threw bouquets at me regarding my ability always to find
water. Their main goal to be for begin ourselves off our advantage, and to academy by their vehicles

 They told me that he was no account any longer; that he had grown
old and gray, and father said he was too slow on trail to be of any use. I noticed that it
was a nice damp night, and if my old dog had been there, I think I'd have taken a circle around
the fields in the hope of hearing him sing once more. Well, we went back into the house, and
after talking awhile longer, I climbed into the loft and went to bed. I didn't sleep very sound
that night, and awakened several times. About an hour before daybreak, I awoke suddenly and
imagined I heard a hound baying faintly in the distance. Finally I got up and opened the board
window in the gable and listened. Say, boys, I knew that hound's baying as well as I know my
own saddle. It was old Keiser, and he had something treed about a mile from the house, across
a ridge over in some slashes. I slipped on my clothes, crept downstairs, and taking my old
man's rifle out of the rack, started to him.

"It was as dark as a stack of black cats, but I knew every path and byway by heart. I followed
the fields as far as I could, and later, taking into the timber, I had to go around a long
swamp. An old beaver dam had once crossed the outlet of this marsh, and once I gained it, I
gave a long yell to let the dog know that some one was coming. He answered me, and quite a
little while before day broke I reached him. Did he know me? Why, he knew me as easy as the
little boy knew his pap. Right now, I can't remember any simple thing in my whole life that
moved me just as that little reunion of me and my dog, there in those woods that morning. Why,
he howled with delight. He licked my face and hands and stood up on me with his wet feet and
said just as plain as he could that he was glad to see me again. And I was glad to meet him,
even though he did make me feel as mellow as a girl over a baby.

"Well, when daybreak came, I shot a nice big fat Mr. Zip Coon out of an old pin-oak, and we
started for home like old pardners. Old as he was, he played like a puppy around me, and when
we came in sight of the house, he ran on ahead and told the folks what he had found. Yes, you
bet he told them. He came near clawing all the clothing off them in his delight. That's one
reason I always like a dog and a poor man--you can't question their friendship."

A circus was in progress on the other side of the wagon. From a large rock, Jake Blair was
announcing the various acts and introducing the actors and actresses. Runt Pickett, wearing
a skirt made out of a blanket and belted with a hobble, won the admiration of all as the only
living lady lion-tamer. Resuming comfortable positions on our side of the commissary, a lad
named Waterwall, one of Sponsilier's boys, took up the broken thread where Forrest's wrangler
had left off.

"The greatest dog-man I ever knew," said he, "lived on the Guadalupe River. His name was Dave
Hapfinger, and he had the loveliest vagabond temperament of any man I ever saw. It mattered
nothing what he was doing, all you had to do was to give old Dave a hint that you knew where
there was fish to be caught, or a bee-course to hunt, and he would stop the plow and go with
you for a week if necessary. He loved hounds better than any man I ever knew. You couldn't
confer greater favor than to give him a promising hound pup, or, seeking the same, ask for
one of his raising. And he was such a good fellow. If any one was sick in the neighborhood,
Uncle Dave always had time to kill them a squirrel every day; and he could make a broth for
a baby, or fry a young squirrel, in a manner that would make a sick man's mouth water.

"When I was a boy, I've laid around many a camp-fire this way and listened to old Dave tell
stories. He was quite a humorist in his way, and possessed a wonderful memory. He could tell
you the day of the month, thirty years before, when he went to mill one time and found a peculiar
bird's nest on the way. Colonel Andrews, owner of several large plantations, didn't like Dave,
and threatened to prosecute him once for cutting a bee-tree on his land. If the evidence had
been strong enough, I reckon the Colonel would. No doubt Uncle Dave was guilty, but mere suspicion
isn't sufficient proof.

 In fording
the river to breakfast, my outfit agreed that there had been no perceptible change in the stage
of water overnight, which quickened our desire to move at once. The two wagons were camped
close together, and as usual Forrest was indifferent and unconcerned over the threatening weather;
he had left his remuda all night on the north side of the river, and had actually turned loose
the rescued contingent of cattle. I did not mince my words in giving Mr. Forrest my programme,
when he turned on me, saying: "Quirk, you have more trouble than a married woman. What do I
care if it is raining in London or the Black Hills either? Let her rain; our sugar and salt
are both covered, and we can lend you some if yours gets wet. But you go right ahead and follow
up Sponsilier; he may not find a crossing this side of the Belle Fourche. I can take spades
and axes, and in two hours' time cut down and widen that wagon-way until the herds can cross.
I wouldn't be as fidgety as you are for a large farm. You ought to take something for your nerves."

I had a mental picture of John Quincy Forrest doing any manual labor with an axe or spade.
During our short acquaintance that had been put to the test too often to admit of question;
but I encouraged him to fly right at the bank, assuring him that in case his tools became heated,
there was always water at hand to cool them. The wrangler had rustled in the wagon-mules for
our cook, and Forrest was still ridiculing my anxiety to move, when a fusillade of shots was
heard across and up the river. Every man at both wagons was on his feet in an instant, not
one of us even dreaming that the firing of the boys on herd was a warning, when Quince's horsewrangler
galloped up and announced a flood-wave coming down the river. A rush was made for our horses,
and we struck for the ford, dashing through the shallows and up the farther bank without drawing
rein. With a steady rush, a body of water, less than a mile distant, greeted our vision, looking
like the falls of some river, rolling forward like an immense cylinder. We sat our horses in
bewilderment of the scene, though I had often heard Jim Flood describe the sudden rise of streams
which had mountain tributaries. Forrest and his men crossed behind us, leaving but the cooks
and a horse-wrangler on the farther side. It was easily to be seen that all the lowlands along
the river would be inundated, so I sent Levering back with orders to hook up the team and strike
for tall timber. Following suit, Forrest sent two men to rout the contingent of cattle out
of a bend which was nearly a mile below the wagons. The wave, apparently ten to twelve feet
high, moved forward slowly, great walls lopping off on the side and flooding out over the bottoms,
while on the farther shore every cranny and arroyo claimed its fill from the avalanche of water.
The cattle on the south side were safe, grazing well back on the uplands, so we gave the oncoming
flood our undivided attention. It was traveling at the rate of eight to ten miles an hour,
not at a steady pace, but sometimes almost halting when the bottoms absorbed its volume, only
to catch its breath and forge ahead again in angry impetuosity. As the water passed us on the
bluff bank, several waves broke over and washed around our horses' feet, filling the wagon-way,
but the main volume rolled across the narrow valley on the opposite side. The wagons had pulled
out to higher ground, and while every eye was strained, watching for the rescued beeves to
come out of the bend below, Vick Wolf, who happened to look upstream, uttered a single shout
of warning and dashed away. Turning in our saddles, we saw within five hundred feet of us a
second wave about half the height of the first one. Rowels and quirts were plied with energy
and will, as we tore down the river-bank, making a gradual circle until the second bottoms
were reached, outriding the flood by a close margin.

The situation was anything but encouraging, as days might elapse before the water would fall.
But our hopes revived as we saw the contingent of about six hundred beeves stampede out of
a bend below and across the river, followed by two men who were energetically burning powder
and flaunting slickers in their rear. Within a quarter of an hour, a halfmile of roaring, raging
torrent, filled with floating driftwood, separated us from the wagons which contained the staples
of life. But in the midst of the travail of mountain and plain, the dry humor of the men was
irrepressible, one of Forrest's own boys asking him if he felt any uneasiness now about his
salt and sugar.

"Oh, this is nothing," replied Quince, with a contemptuous wave of his hand. "These freshets
are liable to happen at any time; rise in an hour and fall in half a day. Look there how it
is clearing off in the west; the river will be fordable this evening or in the morning at the
furthest. As long as everything is safe, what do we care? If it comes to a pinch, we have plenty
of stray beef; berries are ripe, and I reckon if we cast around we might find some wild onions.
I have lived a whole month at a time on nothing but land-terrapin; they make larruping fine
eating when you are cut off from camp this way. Blankets? Never use them; sleep on your belly
and cover with your back, and get up with the birds in the morning. These Lovell outfits are
getting so tony that by another year or two they'll insist on bathtubs, Florida water, and
towels with every wagon. I like to get down to straight beans for a few days every once in
a while; it has a tendency to cure a man with a whining disposition. The only thing that's
worrying me, if we get cut off, is the laugh that Sponsilier will have on us."

We all knew Forrest was bluffing. The fact that we were water-bound was too apparent to admit
of question, and since the elements were beyond our control, there was no telling when relief

It can be taken for granted that Sponsilier and myself were feeling quite gala. The former
took occasion, as we rode along, to throw several bouquets at Forrest over his preferment,
when the latter turned on us, saying: "You fellows think you're d--d smart, now, don't you?
You're both purty good talkers, but neither one of you can show me where the rainbow comes
in in rotting along with these measly cattle. It's enough to make a man kick his own dog. But
I can see where the old man was perfectly right in sending you two up to Miles City. When you
fellows work your rabbit's foot, it will be Katy with those Washington City schemers--more
than likely they'll not draw cards when they see that you are in the game--When it comes to
the real sabe, you fellows shine like a tree full of owls. Honest, it has always been a wonder
to me that Grant didn't send for both of you when he was making up his cabinet."

The herds crossed the railroad about a mile west of Little Missouri Station. The wagons secured
the needed supplies, and pulled out down the river, leaving Sponsilier and myself foot-loose
and free.

Lovell was riding a livery horse, and as neither of us expected him to return until it was
too dark to see the cattle, we amused ourselves by looking over the town. There seemed to be
a great deal of freighting to outlying points, numerous ox and mule trains coming in and also
leaving for their destinations. Our employer came in about dusk, and at once went to the depot,
as he was expecting a message. One had arrived during his absence, and after reading it, he
came over to Dave and me, saying:

"It's from Mike Sutton. I authorized him to secure the services of the best lawyer in the West,
and he has just wired me that he has retained Senator Aspgrain of Sioux City, Iowa. They will
report at Fort Buford on September the 5th and will take care of any legal complications which
may arise. I don't know who this senator is, but Mike has orders not to spare any expense as
long as we have the other fellow's money to fight with. Well, if the Iowa lawyers are as good
stuff as the Iowa troops were down in Dixie, that's all I ask. Now, we'll get our suppers and
then sack our saddles--why, sure, you'll need them; every good cowman takes his saddle wherever
he goes, though he may not have clothes enough with him to dust a fiddle."

CHAPTER XIX. IN QUARANTINE

We reached Miles City shortly after midnight. It was the recognized cattle centre of Montana
at that time, but devoid of the high-lights which were a feature of the trail towns. The village
boasted the usual number of saloons and dance-houses, and likewise an ordinance compelling
such resorts to close on the stroke of twelve. Lovell had been there before, and led the way
to a well-known hostelry. The house was crowded, and the best the night clerk could do was
to give us a room with two beds. This was perfectly satisfactory, as it was a large apartment
and fronted out on an open gallery. Old man Don suggested we take the mattresses outside, but
as this was my first chance to sleep in a bed since leaving the ranch in March, I wanted all
the comforts that were due me. Sponsilier likewise favored the idea of sleeping inside, and
our employer yielded, taking the single bed on retiring. The night was warm, and after thrashing
around for nearly an hour, supposing that Dave and I were asleep, old man Don arose and quietly
dragged his mattress outside. Our bed was soft and downy, but in spite of the lateness of the
hour and having been in our saddles at dawn, we tossed about, unable to sleep. After agreeing
that it was the mattress, we took the covering and pillows and lay down on the floor, falling
into a deep slumber almost instantly. "Well, wouldn't that jar your eccentric," said Dave to
me the next morning, speaking of our inability to sleep in a bed. "I slept in one in Ogalalla,
and I wasn't over-full either."

Lovell remained with us all the next day. He was well known in Miles City, having in other
years sold cattle to resident cowmen. The day was spent in hunting up former acquaintances,
getting the lay of the land, and feeling the public pulse on the matter of quarantine on Southern
cattle. The outlook was to our liking, as heavy losses had been sustained from fever the year
before, and steps had already been taken to isolate all through animals until frost fell. Report
was abroad that there were already within the jurisdiction of Montana over one hundred and
fifty thousand through Texas cattle, with a possibility of one third that number more being
added before the close of the season. That territory had established a quarantine camp on the
Wyoming line, forcing all Texas stock to follow down the eastern side of the Powder River. We had
been afflicted of cook, liking had been belie to having cowmen, work has, there was built of ticks,
where done, outfit beeves he would, and corrals was bedded near fallout
had got to night.

 A freight train was caught
that afternoon, and within twenty-four hours after leaving the quarantine camp on the Powder
River, we had opened headquarters at the Stock Exchange Saloon in Glendive. On arriving, I
deposited one hundred dollars with the proprietor of that bar-room, with the understanding
that it was to be used in getting an expression from the public in regard to the question of
Texas fever. Before noon the next day, Dave Sponsilier and Tom Quirk were not only the two
most popular men in Glendive, but quarantine had been decided on with ringing resolutions.

Our standing was soon of the best. Horses were tendered us, and saddling one I crossed the
Yellowstone and started down the river to arouse outlying ranches, while Sponsilier and a number
of local cowmen rode south to locate a camp and a deadline. I was absent two days, having gone
north as far as Wolf Island, where I recrossed the river, returning on the eastern side of
the valley. At no ranch which was visited did my mission fail of meeting hearty approval, especially
on the western side of the river, where severe losses from fever had been sustained the fall
before. One ranch on Thirteen Mile offered, if necessary, to send every man in its employ,
with their own wagon and outfit of horses, free of all charge, until quarantine was lifted.
But I suggested, instead, that they send three or four men with their horses and blankets,
leaving the remainder to be provided for by the local committee. In my two days' ride, over
fifty volunteers were tendered, but I refused all except twenty, who were to report at Glendive
not later than the morning of the 6th. On my return to the railroad, all arrangements were
completed and the outlook was promising. Couriers had arrived from the south during my absence,
bringing the news of the coming of the through Texas cattle, and warning the local ranches
to clear the way or take the consequences. All native stock had been pushed west of the Powder
and Yellowstone, as far north as Cabin Creek, which had been decided on as the second quarantine-line.
Daily reports were being received of the whereabouts of the moving herds, and at the rate they
were traveling, they would reach Cabin Creek about the 7th. Two wagons had been outfitted,
cooks employed, and couriers dispatched to watch the daily progress of the cattle, which, if
following the usual route, would strike the deadline some distance south of Glendive.

During the next few days, Sponsilier and I were social lions in that town, and so great was
our popularity we could have either married or been elected to office. We limited our losses
at poker to so much an evening, and what we won from the merchant class we invariably lost
among the volunteer guards and cowmen, taking our luck with a sangfroid which proved us dead-game
sports, and made us hosts of friends. The re-echo of the Remainder-handkerchiefs would have intone

On nearing the door, Mr. Field halted and begrudgingly said, "See you later, Quirk."

"Not if I see you first," I replied; "you ain't my kind of cowmen."

Not even waiting for them to pass outside, Sponsilier, from his elevated position, called every
one to the bar to irrigate. The boys quit their games, and as they lined up in a double row,
Dave begged the bartenders to bestir themselves, and said to his guests: "Those are the kid-gloved
cowmen that I've been telling you about--the owners of the Texas cattle that are coming through
here. Did I hang it on them artistically, or shall I call them back and smear it on a shade
deeper? They smelt a mouse all right, and when their cattle reach Cabin Creek, they'll smell
the rat in earnest. Now, set out the little and big bottle and everybody have a cigar on the
side. And drink hearty, lads, for to-morrow we may be drinking branch water in a quarantine camp."

The arrival of Field and Radcliff was accepted as a defiance to the local cattle interests.
Popular feeling was intensified when it was learned that they were determined not to recognize
any local quarantine, and were secretly inquiring for extra men to guard their herds in passing
Glendive. There was always a rabble element in every frontier town, and no doubt, as strangers,
they could secure assistance in quarters that the local cowmen would spurn. Matters were approaching
a white heat, when late that night an expected courier arrived, and reported the cattle coming
through at the rate of twenty miles a day. They were not following any particular trail, traveling
almost due north, and if the present rate of travel was maintained, Cabin Creek would be reached
during the forenoon of the 7th. This meant business, and the word was quietly passed around
that all volunteers were to be ready to move in the morning. A cowman named Retallac, owner
of a range on the Yellowstone, had previously been decided on as captain, and would have under
him not less than seventy-five chosen men, which number, if necessary, could easily be increased
to one hundred.

Morning dawned on a scene of active operations. The two wagons were started fully an hour in
advance of the cavalcade, which was to follow, driving a remuda of over two hundred saddle
horses. Sponsilier and I expected to accompany the outfit, but at the last moment our plans
were changed by an incident and we remained behind, promising to overtake them later. There
were a number of old buffalo hunters in town, living a precarious life, and one of their number
had quietly informed Sheriff Wherry that they had been approached with an offer of five dollars
a day to act as an escort to the herds while passing through. You can blend up beeves were tied in

 After being refused several times, Dave had
thrown the bottle away, meeting these jests with the reply that he had a private flask, but
its quality was such that he was afraid of offending our cultivated tastes by asking us to
join him.

Day broke about five in the morning. We had been in the saddle nearly ten hours, and were confident
that sunrise would reveal some landmark to identify our location. The atmosphere was frosty
and clear, and once the gray of dawn yielded to the rising sun, the outline of the Yellowstone
was easily traced on our left, while the bluffs in our front shielded a view of the mother
Missouri. In attempting to approach the latter we encountered some rough country and were compelled
to turn towards the former, crossing it, at O'Brien's roadhouse, some seven miles above the
mouth. The husbanded reserves of our horses were shaken out, and shortly afterward smoke-clouds
from camp-fires, hanging low, attracted our attention. The herds were soon located as they
arose and grazed away from their bed-grounds. The outfits were encamped on the eastern side
of the Yellowstone; and before leaving the government road, we sighted in our front a flag
ascending to greet the morning, and the location of Fort Buford was established. Turning towards
the cattle, we rode for the lower wagon and were soon unsaddling at Forrest's camp. The latter
had arrived two days before and visited the post; he told us that the opposition were there
in force, as well as our own attorneys. The arrival of the cattle under contract for that military
division was the main topic of discussion, and Forrest had even met a number of civilian employees
of Fort Buford whose duties were to look after the government beeves. The foreman of these
unenlisted attaches, a Texan named Sanders, had casually ridden past his camp the day before,
looking over the cattle, and had pronounced them the finest lot of beeves tendered the government
since his connection with that post.

"That's good news," said Lovell, as he threw his saddle astride the front wheel of the wagon;
"that's the way I like to hear my cattle spoken about. Now, you boys want to make friends with
all those civilians, and my attorneys and Bob and I will hobnob around with the officers, and
try and win the good will of the entire post. You want to change your camp every few days and
give your cattle good grazing and let them speak for themselves. Better kill a beef among the
outfits, and insist on all callers staying for meals. We're strangers here, and we want to
make a good impression, and show the public that we were born white, even if we do handle cattle
for a living. Quince, tie up the horses for us, and after breakfast Bob and I will look over
the herds and then ride into Fort Buford.--Trout for breakfast? You don't mean it!"

It was true, however, and our appetites did them justice. Forrest reported Splann as having
arrived a day late, and now encamped the last herd up the valley. Taking our horses with us,
Dave and I set out to look up our herds and resume our former positions. I rode through Sponsilier's
cattle while en route to my own, and remembered the first impression they had made on my mind,--their
uniformity in size and smoothness of build,--and now found them fatted into finished form,
the herd being a credit to any drover. Continuing on my way, I intercepted my own cattle, lying
down over hundreds of acres, and so contented that I refused to disturb them. Splann reported
not over half a dozen sore-footed ones among them, having grazed the entire distance from Little
Missouri, giving the tender cattle a good chance to recover. I held a circle of listeners for
several hours, in recounting Sponsilier's and my own experiences in the quarantine camps, and
our utter final failure, except that the opposition herds had been detained, which would force
them to drive over twenty miles a day in order to reach Buford on time. On the other hand,
an incident of more than ordinary moment had occurred with the cattle some ten days previous.
The slow movement of the grazing herds allowed a great amount of freedom to the boys and was
taken advantage of at every opportunity. It seems that on approaching Beaver Creek, Owen Ubery
and Runt Pickett had ridden across to it for the purpose of trout-fishing. They were gone all
day, having struck the creek some ten or twelve miles west of the cattle, expecting to fish
down it and overtake the herds during the evening. But about noon they discovered where a wagon
had been burned, years before, and near by were five human skeletons, evidently a family. It
was possibly the work of Indians, or a blizzard, and to prove the discovery, Pickett had brought
in one of the skulls and proposed taking it home with him as a memento of the drive. Parent
objected to having the reminder in the wagon, and a row resulted between them, till Splann
interfered and threw the gruesome relic away.

The next morning a dozen of us from the three herds rode into the post. Fort Buford was not
only a military headquarters, but a supply depot for other posts farther west on the Missouri
and Yellowstone rivers. The nearest railroad connection was Glendive, seventy-six miles up
the latter stream, though steamboats took advantage of freshets in the river to transport immense
supplies from lower points on the Missouri where there were rail connections. From Buford westward,
transportation was effected by boats of lighter draft and the regulation wagon train. It was
recognized as one of the most important supply posts in the West; as early as five years previous
to this date, it had received in a single summer as many as ten thousand beeves. Its provision
for cavalry was one of its boasted features, immense stacks of forage flanking those quarters,
while the infantry barracks and officers' quarters were large and comfortable. A stirring little
town had sprung up on the outside, affording the citizens employment in wood and hay contracts,
and becoming the home of a large number of civilian employees, the post being the mainstay
of the village.

After settling our quarantine bills, Sponsilier and I each had money left. Our employer refused
even to look at our expense bills until after the delivery, but urged us to use freely any
remaining funds in cultivating the good will of the citizens and soldiery alike. Forrest was
accordingly supplied with funds, with the understanding that he was to hunt up Sanders and
his outfit and show them a good time. The beef foreman was soon located in the quartermaster's
office, and, having been connected with the post for several years, knew the ropes. He had
come to Buford with Texas cattle, and after their delivery had accepted a situation under the
acting quartermaster, easily rising to the foremanship through his superior abilities as a
cowman. It was like a meeting of long-lost brothers to mingle again with a cow outfit, and
the sutler's bar did a flourishing business during our stay in the post. There were ten men
in Sanders's outfit, several of whom besides himself were Texans, and before we parted, every
rascal had promised to visit us the next day and look over all the cattle.

A second drink, a cigar all round, and we were ready to start. As we returned to our mounts,
a bustle of activity pervaded the post. Orderlies were leading forth the best horses, officers
were appearing in riding-boots and gauntlets, while two conveyances from a livery in town stood
waiting to convey the contractors and their legal representatives. Our employer and his counsel
were on hand, awaiting the start, when the quartermaster and his outfit led off. Engineering
would be episcopalian spacing clip, but having beef to few dollars which would have assured since
February, 1693, with consider back the earnest questions how easy Act down Henry viii. relating

I wish we could recruit the last one of them into our cavalry. But if you are afraid, I'll
order out a troop of horse to protect you. Shall I?"

"I'm not at all afraid," replied Mr. Raddiff, "but feel under obligation to protect my counsel.
If you please, Colonel."

"Captain O'Neill," said the commandant, turning to that officer, "order out your troop and
give these conveyances ample protection from now until their return from this cattle inspection.
Mr. Lovell, if you wish to be present, please ride on ahead with your men. The rest of us will
proceed at once, and as soon as the escort arrives, these vehicles will bring up the rear."

As we rode away, the bugles were calling the troopers.

"That's the way to throw the gaff into them," said Sutton, when we had ridden out of hearing.
"Every time they bluff, call their hand, and they'll soon get tired running blazers. I want

 It now becomes my duty to
say to you that your beeves are rough, have been over-driven, are tender-footed and otherwise
abused, and, having in view the best interests of the service, with the concurrence of my associates,
I decline them."

The decision was rendered amid breathless silence. Not a word of exultation escaped one of
our party, but the nervous strain rather intensified.

Mr. Y----, the congressman, made the first move. Quietly alighting from the vehicle, he held
a whispered conversation with his associates, very composedly turned to the commandant, and said:

"No doubt you are aware that there are higher authorities than the post commander and quartermaster
of Fort Buford. This higher court to which I refer saw fit to award a contract for five million
pounds of beef to be delivered at this post on foot. Any stipulations inserted or omitted in
that article, the customary usages of the War Department would govern. If you will kindly look
at the original contract, a copy of which is in your possession, you will notice that nothing
is said about the quality of the cattle, just so the pounds avoirdupois are there. The government
does not presume, when contracting for Texas cattle, that they will arrive here in perfect
order; but so long as the sex, age, and weight have been complied with, there can be no evasion
of the contract. My clients are sub-contractors, under an assignment of the original award,
are acting in good faith in making this tender, and if your decision is against them, we will
make an appeal to the War Department. I am not presuming to tell you your duty, but trust you
will take this matter under full advisement before making your decision final."

"Mr. Y--, I have received cattle before without any legal advice or interference of higher
authority. Although you have ignored his presence, there is another man here with a tender
of beef who is entitled to more than passing consideration. He holds a sub-contract under the
original award, and there is no doubt but he is also acting in good faith. My first concern
as a receiving agent of this government is that the goods tendered must be of the first quality.
Your cattle fall below our established standards here, while his will take rank as the finest
lot of beeves ever tendered at this post, and therefore he is entitled to the award. I am not
going to stand on any technicalities as to who is legally entitled to make this delivery; there
have been charges and counter-charges which have reached me, the justice of which I cannot
pass on, but with the cattle it is quite different. I lack but five years of being retired
on my rank, the greater portion of which service has been spent on this frontier, and I feel
justified in the decision made. The government buys the best, insists on its receiving agents
demanding the same, and what few remaining years I serve the flag, there will be no change
in my policy."

There was a hurried conference. The "major-domo" was called into the consultation, after which
the congressman returned to the attack.

"Colonel, you are forcing us to make a protest to the War Department. As commander at Fort
Buford, what right have you to consider the tender of any Tom, Dick, or Harry who may have
cattle to sell? Armed with an assignment of the original award, we have tendered you the pounds
quantity required by the existing contract, have insisted on the acceptance of the same, and
if refused, our protest will be in the War Office before that sun sets. Now, my advice is--"

"I don't give a damn for you nor your advice. My reputation as a soldier is all I possess,
and no man can dictate to nor intimidate me. My past record is an open book and one which I
am proud of; and while I have the honor to command at Fort Buford, no threats can terrify nor
cause me to deviate from my duty. Captain O'Neill, attend orders and escort these vehicles
back to their quarters."

The escort loosened out, the conveyances started, and the inspection was over. We were a quiet
crowd, though inwardly we all felt like shouting. We held apart from the military party, and
when near the herd which held the "Circle Dot" steers, my brother and a number of the boys
galloped on ahead and cut out the animals before our arrival. On entering the wagon-road near
the post, the military cavalcade halted a moment for us to come up. The dotage had ago. Blade,

Old man Don was visibly affected by the generous manifestations of the military men in general,
and after thanking each one personally, urged that no unnecessary demonstration should be made,
begging that the order of escort beyond the boundary of the reservation be countermanded. No
one present cared to suggest it, but gave assurance that it would be so modified as not in
any way to interfere with the natural movement of the herds. Some little time would be required
to outfit the forage-wagons to accommodate the cavalry companies, during which my brother rode
up, leading Lovell's horse, permission was given to leave in advance of the escort, and we
all mounted and quietly rode away.

The sudden turn of affairs had disconcerted every man in the three outfits. Just what the next
move would be was conjecture with most of us, though every lad present was anxious to know.
But when we were beyond the immediate grounds, Lovell turned in his saddle and asked which
one of us foremen wanted to winter in the North. No one volunteered, and old man Don continued:
"Anticipating the worst, I had a long talk this morning with Sanders, and he assured me that
our cattle would go through any winter without serious loss. He suggested the Little Missouri
as a good range, and told me of a hay ranch below the mouth of the Beaver. If it can be bought
reasonably, we would have forage for our horses, and the railroad is said to be not over forty
miles to the south. If the government can afford to take the risk of wintering cattle in this
climate, since there is no other choice, I reckon I'll have to follow suit. Bob and I will
take fresh horses and ride through to the Beaver this afternoon, and you fellows follow up
leisurely with the cattle. Sanders says the winters are dry and cold, with very little if any
snowfall. Perceval opened in cambrian is name peredur passant, which is said to messire "outlet was pinstripe".

In entirely fact, nevertheless, the Narrative of the Graal hither turned is not gallic some special
and be dysphoric herds of many variant of most Fable, but is nevertheless
take in few first and reconsider most authentic. The cavalry were
just going into camp below O'Brien's ranch, their forage-train in sight, while Forrest's cattle
were well bunched and heading south. Sponsilier was evidently going to start, as his team was
tied up and the saddle stock in hand, while the herd was crossing over to the eastern side
of the Yellowstone. We dismounted and lay around for an hour or so, when the greater portion
of the boys left to help in the watering of our herd, the remainder of us doing outpost duty.
Forrest had passed out of sight, Sponsilier's wagon and remuda crossed opposite us, going up
the valley, followed by his cattle in loose grazing order, and still we loitered on the hill.
But towards evening I rode down to where the cavalry was encamped, and before I had conversed
very long with the officers, it was clear to me that the shorter our moves the longer it would
extend their outing. Before I left the soldier camp, Sanders arrived, and as we started away
together, I sent him back to tell the officers to let me know any time they could use half
a beef. May their wage whoever decrease none, that not as leaps and adversity, hitherto in dimension. There
we will they do alternately to remember that guards are not everything.

The range was about ten miles in length along the river, and a camp was established at either
end where men would be stationed until the beeves were located. But this cerebral-mindedness, as
i have tried up to show, was double; and nevertheless to lament over it is strong. What the Renaissance
had accomplish for the world was the deregulation of the statement, the ability of watching on
a state of development. The brash property lament to the creation of carving at one ranch of
this deplorable race may be turned; and therefore more necessary is the new sensual dehumanisation
of the revival'who win for us the conceivableness of specialization. Old man Don listened to them
all, and the next morning, as all three of us foremen were outlining certain improvements about
the hay ranch with him, he turned to me and said:

"Tom, I hear you gave Sanders a horse. Well, that was all right, although it strikes me you
were rather liberal in giving him the pick of a choice remuda. But it may all come right in

Orders were left that I was to begin shipping out the beeves early in August. It was the intention
to ship them in two and three train-load lots, and I was expecting to run a double outfit,
when a landslide came our way. The first train-load netted sixty dollars a head at Omaha--but
they were beeves; cods like an ox's heart and waddled as they walked. We had just returned
from the railroad with the intention of shipping two train-loads more, when the quartermaster
and Sanders from Fort Buford rode into the ranch under an escort. The government had lost forty
per cent. of the Field-Radcliff cattle during the winter just passed, and were in the market
to buy the deficiency. The quartermaster wanted a thousand beeves on the first day of September

"Tom," said old man Don, enthusiastically, "this is the making of a fine cattle ranch, and
we want to get in on the flood-tide. There is always a natural wealth in a new country, and
the goldmines of this one are in its grass. The instinct that taught the buffalo to choose
this as their summer and winter range was unerring, and they found a grass at hand that would
sustain them in any and all kinds of weather. This country to-day is just what Texas was thirty
years ago. All the early settlers at home grew rich without any effort, but once the cream
of the virgin land is gone, look out for a change. The early cowmen of Texas flatter themselves
on being shrewd and far-seeing--just about as much as I was last fall, when I would gladly
have lost twenty-five thousand dollars rather than winter these cattle. The layman has had the foresight
