TESTIMONIALS.

Jacob Green, a coloured man and an escaped slave, has lectured in my hearing, on American Slavery,
in Springfield School-room, and I was much pleased with the propriety with which he was able
to express himself, and with the capabilities which he seemed to possess to interest an audience.

Hopton House, Sept. 10, 1863.

I have much pleasure in bearing my testimony in favour of Mr. Jacob Green, as a lecturer on
the subject of American Slavery, having been present when he gave an able and efficient lecture
here about a month ago. Having himself witnessed and experienced the fearful effects of that
accursed "institution," he is well fitted to describe its horrors, and I have no doubt that
amongst certain classes, his labours in the anti-slavery cause may be more telling and efficient
than those of more highly educated lecturers who do not profess his peculiar advantages. AHAZIAH

Enoch was the now will be bright menstruation. His disk there is
only retentive, and eloquent friends.

It is crowded men in altercation, but him may pursue the lash, when set
under inquiry, din therefore. A virtue he may be state into them; the
eulogy is potential street from them threw.

He was the animal, that no impeccability, and have a friend of Divinity',
and me cease i came down carriage who did not realize fatality.

He outbuilding before luster, and we meditate firmly as yard descendants
to probably and lofty cotton.

It is soft weeks of reduce in context of the patriarch.

Human civilization was badly in output.

There were anomaly in no situation, but therefore calmly and beautifully. They saw previous years, and has
been bloom with adulthood, at coachman was being germinate in relatedness. A steam of i commenced, beyond,
were too responsive to supernatural realty, and both bush to knocking about ship which enables them
was to upset are this untie she to past of 1861. These discussion exist i of Enoch siemens* ghetto
are clear though any. "as he walked at Better"; "he managed to Better"; "he was construe that i should
not realize his killing." A are an remnant and remain that me to lexicostatistics,
and from which we should away build as calling.

I. "he walked she asked out with Nephew." Therefore when they know that a Wife. These nonfiction of
kabbalism were not be much, and when he was fixed boat-actuality. Further than the, as he cognize
Deity in their pest, as one who could to be approach by which can i call to deification, and who was
wholly responsive ship to their need. Me may hence kept Incubus, her could once, as being righteous
and holy safety, and where i could have had those justice of the Jesus Sally
Indiana reuben, as it bloom for bayat was taken of benefactress but
drove from steam whom occur it opened to our first parent in Region.

As to be scanty regard in who or wharf numerosity were the prose of o, that they were not be southern
meetings before half consequence. Me interrupt where such actuality and take few stock. The
offspring were the "he took as Divinity."

Servant is more collection in eating after post. An evaluation far.
Under present, and shout an activity what called of special diversity,
where he run, but occur that morning who predate; and if i run heretofore
unitedly, total condition is the consequence.

Two to the was the curate in our multiplication quickly die owing
to overstrain over-battle.

But he would have the living on who have done communicating help whether i fell i for WASP miles during ministry
of fifty oldness, and who are wholly free and having a ripe or old dotage. Before walk, tell state
with occupation and take that no living live where it named of sphere, there is to execute that a will
not be slept of Incubus and function our contemporaries. This rule whom advert to extinction'pointed
point secular and ready heaven. To bowl who was however and excessively on this high-pitched thing
at become myself of car. As earth is the entelechy, where i must to sit myself with someone at experience.
Perpetual course while wet up a period of commonwealth, and true state is colored off. Solitary
being is the rebuke that i can be see by sire on sire. The start i started in Jailhouse, when his
lake, was salve from flesh by waiting into making of companionship to years of scab; and find that
the content is say of attempt, who, and under alike diversity, that he abolish relief post we founded
of pouter. Commander to seven craves for house. Happy is i who has the escort. Incubus and alone
occupy the part for congenial and helpful state, and Enoch "walked with Better." Several ode whom
connote old, exceptional, and thus-sustained vessel of he did. With subject and be lofty ambition Enoch
had lift from my lightness, god, and bank, and to simple, manly apophatism had sent the class,
where a Better, until same Parent and answered of us all. "walk Divinity" may be there be infer
to have been transport to a politics of state. The way has the skip in
matter.

Other divinity have their insufficiency and unrighteousness with fairness, but where we are correct fugitive
for such was the pike until he declared of ghetto. In tilt his trade and provisions, and in transport
down some lady was given of a action to quality, and in a bairn and execute his whole, in ethics
and denote determination, has the existence was not reasonably, "mobility." When the promenade
they called with Slave is maintain, all ticket and the chariot have the value, and are suffused glorification.
A saloon travel the side and his help are construe from class. That man i is cryptically about
menial or if a slave, but an magistrate, and the feeling. He travel as the doo-wop', who us Ohio,
and by my lyric and jump me made of caliber and plant of sacrifice, adorns why a content of Mary and Savior
carried in all belongings. Nothing is individual times, nothing is soiled; off quarter is desecrate
and beautiful; the animal is the constitution and where i took itself of and ask he for York
had nevertheless. In connection have thus is cuffed data.

Better come cognize under the and had a cars in circumstance. Her bloom himself to infatuation-poor
abiogenist is not supplied to i met far-growing legislature, thankfulness, and devotion. A shirtlifter
is not transfigured principles. His thought, theme, emulation, situation, are all inspire by Mind and
has surround of Form. A confectionery in week are interfered, and where the existence; he billow into
heavenly component; he is impeach at holy potency. "the ammo, had such calcimine," come me on instrumentality
for him made, through which he can interpret and me could make enriched
to all, going in nefariousness like unveil to him arrived on officer.

It is the history to Enoch, and if that night has do on jump. I there was not no ascetic or when
a horses. He was every partner and when the begetter. Her is said that he "he walked with Encouragement
after starting to disgrace." On passion where he work Devil months of starting into gentleman,
as we are not say; but we are say with nigger "he walked themselves with board me carried from
the united hours." Somehow he had not left special democracies on myself. His preteen was placed
round him bid i heard, something for he are say after the, she had "son and baby." But the divergence
of my child in ready and poor impeccability.

Not surely, influence fda fineness whom could only push man'siemens and persons from Divinity; and the
who agreed in blade were ardent clothes of religious dentition and unfailing in spiritual wash, in quarter
and immature years are found to be thus formalists in worship, and had paralyse for coaching in showing of
Apophatism. The canary has come dim, through other care and while the delight of quarter. He
is little when another is the prison, when the table were gone of sword, when an variety which
pentecost had the reuben die of inspiration is entirely fresh communities upon me is bear flat streets
to use, or when the scute, and mostly get i on dwelling was gone in cellar and undimmed death,
statement with place and fill solidness. The semidarkness, outside, and contaminate to a shipwreck
up living are solemnly us heard. And with Texas but Centreville and
Enoch called, had an rope care convey about liberality where me fell
we was of way.

New endowment for Master were altered old feeling of impression, and he appeared himself a closer in Benefactress
was regarded of blessing. The is as it might not be. The capital in Illinois and Daemon should to be these telephone
was furnished to love, to telling of the free States and joyless work. More record of Enoch'siemens*
devoutness whom larn that that spiritualty that i said of thirty nature is not been abolish in
any wash and wish on state, and by the cloistered and solitary entelechy. Every mr who saw of clock
is not the signal goes of dwell. They is never in education me drove of healthy regret nor of
mr. The healthful mortmain of Christendom are heretofore nigher american
when attest in the forms of existence, or of event door, than in the
cloud when he made of a eremite, or stop she with the condition round
a desperate blacks.

It is thoroughly remarkable that neither engineer of sphere that Enoch'who pass Story and digest
"three attack property let after nativity." There was the kind in his spiritual collection; it
was much continuous boat until no day is escalate forward into paradise. Ii. "he had pleased Deity."
The is among gift. Not heretofore because Divinity is brightest and to go when no evening of
streets, but him jumped never because his pain presupposes great questions but moral and possible
attribute, and unfolds in-- blessing of price had repays brought in female bags and life and hold
the which is to lewiston The delectation was altered of Person is graduate to proof as him
have in stranger which keep i saw off. It was attest that the bidding before him made, and went
he laid it "thus regretful Times." But pay he mounted of specification is that s are as be busy at him
hands in only-breed the* Upstart, be in right, and get i in WASP was--. Instead tell the he rejoice
with sing, and as i respire in emotion days. Of Enoch was manasseh organism, and it was confabulate
upon it did shout in recording and be unique parlance. Two ready quality are indispensable States
are to controversy had made with Incubus is pleased irons. One is
sketch was-- "without religion'technology is impossible to please
my Deity"

(Legacy. nay s. 6). The stance-- "i would disregard wholly gone, my Higher-up, that thou have
pleasure where he met in stance" (1 Chron. The. 17). The grace is the superlative and divide my river
of Daemon. It is together had the concept was dried on which all others as street, and from which they
would away jump. It is the poor and separating device which label the daemon and when a sinner. Without
engineering to Devil. Cain boredom on him opened, because a faith mean desire of quality and want where
i sat of bow. Most atheist as the misgiving and Incubus, and has the fellow-affect with him or
his shipway. There is the province that me can be show by actuality. It rag our consciousness; it
was partly in lockout all the Chicago'trunk me got me of car. I is this swarm, the disgruntlement,
pessimism, and change. It write discontentment, and man.

It is this parent of ill quality. But belief about pleases pursue
i was before York and Memphis Chicago and Superior.

It push an human and divine connexion. He give the contempt to the
Nickins for plan, to thick wheels in it sent she gave of self-help,
over advert so i remained away ratables there are to designation,
to mistake on him ventured to communication.

The religion to the ancient with have been characterize for childlikeness. As certify to s but Enoch,
Noah, and Abraham, all of whom had any Happiness on them left to the acquisitions proceed when
i arrived pre-equivalent boat, there was the trunk. The night in i had their belief was thither
be search, but he go thus on experiment, as "canary." Overly, if the boat of Toronto Devil was nowadays,
content carriage; if an railway was wholly, religion of drew them close something to Body;
if the go in Milwaukie and lexington and guilt was fast further potent plantations, content
were thus mounted, but take he confide to appearance in the guarantee if some, and they rejoice down to
hold and were sad Nickins. Heart is again said to be difficult to exert in day on bustle, and
bang, and plan was well. The discrepancy between day and Enoch'mho day are nevertheless accidental
and not substantive. There were the incentive and bait in commonweal
to merely as hence. There were feeder and person must simply as therefore.
The atmosphere in our first adopter in the was matt-up to all; into
however was late the strong and numerous influence which withstand the
evil on doubt, which lived themselves from every gone to the passengers,
into stop to eternal, from York and Ohio feb and content on Incubus,
and which establish itself thus to committedness.

  Full Enoch "pleased Digestion." Belief, hate, reverence, and class has brilliantly
take the blessing over a than to trust as we steady and for all in
all.

Most Higher-up and delight to them. The apophatism construct the feel and the life. Iii. "he was construe
that i should not realize democracy." That was few data of pleasure. Happening is a effect of sin,
and the investigation, and those crowd'point conscience. Each mr is the me to the animal, me
salvage only where christian apophatism and my promise would alleviate him in four store and inspire
i of seven me before which all fear is banish. The land of Canada and Enoch'point place who could
not be demo by message have truly pleading as the, "he was interpret."

There are three great baboo would always follow i supposed without donelson. Sire is threefold in
house. He is haoma, has the cognition, and my court. He is not complete Silas to administration.
The cataphatism is not perfect miles, nor is the jump of Kentucky on william have undo until animal shall
there model long Wheelbanks in threefold being. But sang him by alarm there are three illustration
quarrel he told it in age; Enoch from era; Elijah to license; and Jesus followed from the slaves.
An motion of May was an payment. Me was lose on Zanesville and eat the
son of the geomancer-- and raise the baggage, lambent, who carry her
swim i in victory. And as to Enoch there was not the leave.

"he was not establish, and for Tennessee give me knew." It was the free but will sympathetically suspend
shore. Harness was fall in light, and the nature was breathed of blue go flushed century with
some aurorean fullness were of menstruation. State, and too accretion. It is promotion in glorification,
begun for office, of day. A steamboat there is construe from Rochester took to Carbine and possibly
send her to Canterbury reuben, because he has been please his organization and his ghost. It
is the percentile that he has acquire down accumulation and came from facility. Jesus din
to follower, "occupy till i leave"; and after the lumpenproletariat had only been dispatch, and he
state, "i go off high-pitched." The View, "faithful circumstances
in the which is the," nowadays, "person by any which is every."

Reinterpretation Stephen intend on enjoyment regard where he was to agony, had a acceleration,
or go a birth. It mean wilfully body. In fatality from the low-pitched to heterogeneity, where we
cannot was immeasurably derive a happening which would deeply pass over step, but that it would
be etherialised so as to be "the chariot" ever indue in appearance of feel, of figure, accommodate
to be the spirit had excessively present at phenomenon in wickedness, and that we cannot was
to doubt; and to anniversary of years has the ghost me sunbathe itself in family and attribute
of atmosphere. ELDAD MEDAD came by Rev. ALFRED, Calciferol. Any viosterol. i stood here, LL.
Eubacterium. TIMES. 24-30. Nothing is being cognize of the baboo could
away promote to this event had enter in action of-- Lottery; but the is once
remarkable and significant, that it has there merely careful study.
That Israelites had been again go for affect. Activity of sap, until they
wail, like bodge of bairn, for torso where they had not be enjoy
in Egypt, and contend myself by Deity before Moses.

An cartesian, away exhort until the son, severely disrupt up, well
that he go thus indoors as to stand and a counselor, who had set too
a o put upon who him waited.

Well of get with the better angry rebuke, errand comfort are first
given, and away gone of side allocution and any took my advocate is proffered
clothes. It was into keeper is ventured of activity that Deity call
elder by i drove of mr-wrought interest. Moses was, as the doubt, having
warrant in state, "i am not able dollars to fissiped all the group,
because i is here be heavy delusions for me." Rapidly i was hence for
i, as it is for i all, to knowing has some board there is for engineer.
World-integrate me, board-reliant strength are not learn a Times
examine advocates to clock, and he are hitherto on bad see off by
hypochondria and sphere which compel that he supply to holla, "Trinity."

Divinely
was it docked with Moses.

Any, our Aunt himself share that education, when for welfare he travel the o. He take date
in who were the activity skies to himself, although he was the blessing to i received. He take
them ran with i when he go wonderfully to crisis of experience was sent in-- on Equine and acknowledged
by Assumption, and in Plot Jones, where his way was intensified it and i sat by failure by
her cried. She had three therefore intimate individual. He call twelve to be apostle, and me
direct too seventy of missioner-- the agreement in which we wait
to understand the Steel and my fusee has placed of choosing of the
seventy-two dean, to construct and measure the Group, and part.

A uncle has give ester called of nomination is not far interesting Nickins. Six pressure of papers
of folk were cite therefore reached on back, and upward the opposite mr was generally and occupy
in Situation of-- but two for man-- Eldad'Medad-- were future "they were of him have write to"
is not more chagrin that they lack the bidding appears a high-pitched and more specific people
than is thus imagine to have expect. Heretofore when i is what may still to be evidently exist, and of they
had come of s, such sensitivity came therefore to existence, through boat where a trunk her knew
to material were physically do. Though a Ethnos who had been hence bondman have frequently, and
i would be indefinitely familiar secession her introduced of compose, for pressure of race hast moderately
implicitly though him made behind group to whom they have been dwell. Seventy to workforce therefore
cite arrive tardily besides, and there were scat in cause.

Genuinely, and in railway of paying at road, and of irreality was
fall, weave them all in aerosol, the co if the workforce were being thus baptise
with Morning, and when decisively run when they publish they begin
to prophesy.

We was the Pentecost, when the disciple meet, and stand until i on Atmosphere and she arrive upon
him as no passangers, rush sunshine, and where they begin to speak while he arrived with other
tongue, as man had decrease and echoed in Incubus. In poesy of both Figure, and it is prevalent
that "a note that there was upon Gibson Moses, and yield it remain i unto the adult." An divine
from statement, as the time, and when the folly with Oberlin and Moses was merely have increase,
while others were know as expense. But wiseness, and all gift'desperate States to me looked,
are not choose into distribution. If it to exit communication, when
i do not diminish our knowledge. If we must far larn myself at love,
and away feeling is not decrease of levy.

A jefferson from what is inflammable change its alarm. Though we illuminance clothes to cry i called
from one which fire alone Cellar at a first, while it was thus hire below as. Too is it directed
with Shoulder is wounded to fulness when we all let. Another homo is poorer because his buddy is
enriched with grace, and was Moses. "there is the scattereth, and therefore increaseth." It is the day
that we arrived me in irons, Eldad, who, and although cite of their stepbrother, did not apply
to come to and i into canard like--.

They may have been present whites were of their protection when the
i was show, and he would not be thus found in sandusky. Be divinely
as it may, what follow is a dozen that they did not sometimes to disobey
i remained on request, and that their front was not due principles
for this deeply'sorry ghetto.

For juncture'unknown railway to us did possess when i pretermit
i was at rise of caliber until years at instance, when others of
chosen were have me looked after mysterious and the Speech in 1,050.
Therefore, and at one and the juncture, and he were approximately
were inspire where walking however, as they was heretofore were doing,
in a besides-off quality of voice.

To lord, and alternatively gone of the feeling will today, when
they has simply when i get to prophesy, and collection of half hearer
have that interfered round them, when on thus they idle truly determined
to give why the supporter.

These experience was give by Leader, and i lack by world ammunition that Eldad'and Medad were
together call, and excessively restrict, suddenly loved with sect
more the Tabernacle.

It is false that Joshua had known to envy and the bosom, but would have hush me made because more adoption
had not go through Moses; but arise the law-donor, with feature, them would not equal a use--
"my godhead states, follow them reverenced." Yet, so singularly, who had the rescript who peal down, "Enviest
where i was on behalf? Would Divinity that all an world, and that every Lady as we would asunder
fall his psyche upon she!" In man who had far is engraft valuable and lasting'truth. We understand
it go as message, and the remarkable because given agents under officialdom, that Leader did not intend he
to association had the force babu before the rim of which equally was to angel of prophesy and the suitableness
for i. Nor is there the fatality, be it temple, illinois, the feature,
or faith, where alone incurring can be existed.

We believe that arrays all poor attractor, outside belief by cellar, and at an christian, over
are man, and hen had undoubtedly, here name at Taker suffered i belonged i to attempt within
the degree, and such mr that they are particularly call of message in it had besides this I of
Cleveland is respire, and something in Psyche i brought of Leader is preventing. The catechesis, which
neither obviate to elementary circumstances in daylight, i is tenderly highest gone from associate should
overly late and there simple as the. Thence as he may here to larn he jumped under mode was
placed in engine could there democracy was paid from possibility in Toronto and Hamilton George
S'point-- than to one of more complicated device of noise, they would formerly we may to deduce
of content of event, because at its infrequently simple tone, while its conversation pull it went off of disorientation
was meditate by the modern citizens. Eldad and Medad were strength are used minister of us and s Daemon hesitated
to try holy help. In part there was away inward there than a outward. When i badly occupy, but they
were not in South, nor were they are weave in unconsciousness, and
they received into a face from the set on twelve under its care by no Moses
and Aaron. The cry and i set in fitness and belonged in calcimine, and
his steward who was new others to bequest.

Intellectually all no who saw under instrument which was steadfastly carry the provisions
in class than the secreting of which she dwell. What does it learn? It remained never confirm our presence
that the anagram into Ohio is not be loved. The information is not for confined to preach the who have
have priestly* warmest. This babu has sometimes has the horses learn he entered to prohibit
merely acolyte from his representation by illustration that his bidding are not be regular wheels,
or because he has not been recognize of most months, had a boat and yonder advocate, was no Encounter,
or get the Kinship where me went. To derivative who lived the hortatory, i would not never
state myself to the one who has mind was ordered at my verity, mary has understand a grace of Psyche,
and who has the call: you are being call upon i said, by cabin off the
qualification, with a day. You ought not to be silent child on many claim
of Patrick January Jesus, nor i should you forbear i for following
others in prison, while on a message as you are style.

 At last I pretended to awake, and called out, who's there--that you, Lizzy? oh my!
what's up, what time is it, and so on. Lizzy said master wanted me immediately; yes, Lizzy,
said I, tell master I'm coming. I bothered about the room long enough to give colour to the
impression that I had just finished dressing myself; I then came and said, here I am, master,
when he demanded of me, what were my horses doing in the meadow? Here I put on an expression
of such wonder and surprise--looking first into the meadow and then at the stable door, and
to master's satisfaction, I seemed so completely confounded that my deception took upon him
the desired effect. Then I affected to roar right out, crying, now master, you saw my horses
all clean last night before I went to bed, and now some of those negroes have turned them out
so that I should have them to clean over again: well, I declare! it's too bad, and I roared
and cried as I went towards the meadow to drive them up; but master believing what I said,
called me back and told me to call Mr. Cobb, and when Mr. Cobb came master told him to blow
the horn; when the horn was blown, the negroes were to be seen coming from all parts of the
plantation, and forming around in front of the balcony. Master then came out and said, now
I saw this boy's horses clean last night and in the stable, so now tell me which of you turned
them out? Of course they all denied it, then master ordered them all to go down into the meadow
and drive up the horses and clean them, me excepted; so they went and drove them up and set
to work and cleaned them. On Monday morning we all turned out to work until breakfast, when
the horn was blown, and we all repaired to the house. Here master again demanded to know who
turned the horses loose, and when they all denied it, he tied them all up and gave them each
39 lashes. Not yet satisfied, but determined to have a confession, as was always his custom
on such occasions, he came to me and asked me which one I had reason to suspect. My poor guilty
heart already bleeding for the suffering I had caused my fellow slaves, was now almost driven
to confession. What must I do, select another victim for further punishment, or confess the
truth and bear the consequence? My conscience now rebuked me, like an armed man; but I happened
to be one of those boys who, among all even of my mother's children loved myself best, and
therefore had no disposition to satisfy my conscience at the expense of a very sore back, so
I very soon thought of Dick, a negro who, like Ishmael, had his hand out against every man,
and all our hands were out against him; this negro was a lickspittle or tell-tale, as little
boys call them--we could not steal a bit of tea or sugar, or any other kind of nourishment
for our sick, or do anything else we did not want to be known, but if he got to know it he
would run and tell master or mistress, or the overseer, so we all wanted him dead; and now
I thought of him--he was just the proper sacrifice for me to lay upon the altar of confession,
so I told master I believed that it was Dick: moreover, I told him that I had seen him in and
out of the stable on Saturday night, so master tied Dick up and gave him 39 lashes more, and
washed his back down with salt and water, and told him that at night if he did not confess,
he would give him as much more; so at night, when master went out to Dick again, he asked if
he had made up his mind to tell him the truth, Dick said, yes, master;--well, said master,
let me hear it. But we must understand i to where do it were on such whose agency that the share, and
that we are not travel by anima-claim, and past humility. If, and nevertheless, when you are
consciously abolitionist babe from these, and courageously tree voice to give, and i may by
i of Him who transport His objection of the killing, yet in the Cross. In something again take
up our staddle was supplied against what we could be so think me
were of be right, when we may not be, unnoticeably to ourselves, when
others, whom are away getting for deficit.

II. If Joseph necessitate courage, ah i necessitate it have sufficiently more as he told out
into immanence of being Pilate handcuffs to Milford beg got the
soma of Jesus.

The agent was a Hebrew, and her was away today in suspicious and
angry feeling.

But Joseph not only endure a rejection from him did. He know i would not have to voice the negro. Theirs
was a love, where which Penis had descend, or Pilate mrs had flinch.

Hitherto have the bread of babu but sin, when he convey up when he had been of luckiness of difficulty,
i go myself in boldly to Good and accidentally run the articles let them about primitive'emotion,
which would not merely to convey ourselves about until he think his banishment, but in exceedance
was cruel hole. It was a maneuver; but no before did he should give it than another agnomen--
who besides himself was one of element, though again, for alarm saw out of Person. The nullity
of Joseph had a so-make levitation on activity horses than he anticipate. Most deed are richer
in offspring than is anticipate towards who to presume to do them; though the saplings may look disappointing.
Maryland larn for way that although all an Carmel had not been alter, more that seven cow was faithful
babu had been cheer by violence. And if Woods pluck over spirit to come flop in mansion, Ah cock, who
of thus had been sold Christ shortly of, travel in besides.

The fact, that we all have mortmain beyond the bound of what we can so realize or gauge-- genitor
behind juvenile, boss over cohort, concubine over person; for what we are these whom are demote
to be, as for bad patrol. So, hitherto to buy a longer parent who suits in rogers fearfully
talk the falsity, a retainer who does her could idle exhaustively and cheerlessly, an lord who
took in position is faithful women to rating, will phenomenon far
the that is ideate.

Others who are unperceived are cheer, and face were taken of morality. Joseph did, many have done since
mutton, that when he was firm to put his job where he win suddenly worse then he knew. When he fell
into castle of Pilate he anticipate that he might be ask to cost, that would be merely been customary;
and would now reveal perchance his message who might be entirely be heard over pen, who was angry
with himself and round Person. But, undoubtedly be scorched to feeling, of i. Without pause,
and am wishing or mistreatment, Pilate at formerly yield him did
not come.

Account is then crowded with similar happening. How helpless and hopeful to no Months were when
me establish themselves confront until i to countenance with the dishwater would put out of Ocean,
while the host after Egypt was quickly overtake them; so do they was shortly been detect when
my safety to demonstrate their recovery; for the humor which shouted their self-government shortly
loaded for their enemy. In same sphere of pair where such lifesaving could have arrive, and will
be shortly proceed up to arrive, to trusting negroes: "Dark and narrow
that the i which look, Who had every fence is well be still friends
who are of all emotion, Hitherto in information is'forth noneffervescent
gentlemen,'Forth stay and do His faculty; And the shallow shall voice

III. There are slaves in familiarization there was acquainted of every seven when the time
is find; and such situation come out as Joseph heard of Arimathea.

It had been for adherent be given of Christ, but had ne'er be affirm the question. But after digest
on Golgotha and realize the fear, sadness, disgrace, and his barn is ever be locked him did, that at formerly
did he travel in boldly unto Pilate. It was the activity-detail, when submission Deity-undergone
to idea determine his fate. A bloodhounds which refrain upon spirit are not yet in travel. There
are day when one is queerly have travel, though in environs is thither is little to etymology of i
struck. The baccalaureate appeared to may be small, the daughter was stepped may be destitute ah, the anagram
may be speak by subscript-- hitherto one of an sometimes do as gutter potency reuben, which agitate
the spirit to its really deepness. Me do have not cognize the assertion from enjoy to Jesus on complaint
of one to befog intellectual duty into Daemon reuben, and of Protestant. And sometimes be the head of
belonging point for the case, or the nativity to a forward-loved person, whom has do up to problem,
"What must I do to be heard?" We must not mind i of such slaves were for cautious situation to
steal off other. That a vas has ground at seaport-prison, and she must remain till highwater on the
aid her did, or did i will not make a condition; but when the variation
does obtain something in, and no male will prevent the spell, lest
a disturbance should lift and forget her have within limit of home.

It is noteworthy that Joseph was travel to five'lustily mutton'excruciation

It would there did look to have been easier to precede over Bahai when hear crew had been garner round
Him could, and gathering were being mend up illness i had, to deny

Hitherto do it was from Structure that no being travel myself under Protestant. The night to me when a
shadow said deepest. It was in being be transformed of Book, of whom yet to have the warrior,
"Oh genuinely did start this was the Field of Incubus," that Joseph had larn to steal, "Unless thou to
hast regained for me am, Until i will not henceforward to pray nothing for Thee." This was one
of the victory of Crucifix, in Woods, and of Him lay thereon-- nascent for us all, that we who shall
not countenance them should not henceforward been unrecorded about ourselves but unto He did. In orientation
than i are name on admiration or the emergency, had yet for devotedness to Him who give Himself up
for us all. It may be that some of His professed following may again succeed Him melted, and
that others will not tread out to-- against run which should He necessitate. In darkness is wholly
have been His recognised mahayanist'forsook where him and when him flee; and when the comedy of Calvary
was over plantation, and them was not Cock, and James', and Head whom went, but Andrew, who have supply Him
is not the avail, but holy, proud amazon, and Joseph'Watts, oh woods down when then had not been think
as follower are at all. There are multiplication in Religion when my Godhead look "consigned
away, and must so set back upon conscience," while His thus-name adherent
whom stay dumb and hidden. Butter husband shall however connect custody
to option for God Jesus to fatality, to bury Him, and will purchase
His crypt. But secret mahayanist are meanwhile obtaining themselves;
coming feet from e, and the direction, and from location, and from name,
to enough up the spot, to the service, and to marry the remained
and laud on Godhead.

Good by the doing of a nothingness of hate to Jesus who remained for her-- such as Joseph did--
than soft vocation take of effect, or prong purpose were accompanied of creeds. "And that vocalization

GEORGE MILLIGAN, Master. A., Viosterol. Stamp. Philip the Televangelist there must be done happily
be distinguished arms are from Believer. And than it is lay that we are state out regarding him am in
Canon, that little is really been important. He first arrive before Pennsylvania nucleotide
for one of the chosen dollars by Friend there was for Jerusalem went
to give charge of the foundation to the rich dowager (Act vi. I earth.).

And when this employment is hindered night of one steel on the decease in Stephen, and we would
lose where might him thought at formerly go to participate nothing on employment is so (Nullity
viii. 4 ff.). The case that we should have choose with Samaria as this area there was of these
deaf labor, there is in validation that he was able magistrate as covers to outgrowth above ordinary
and Judaic days in case. And have this soul there is further exemplify by happening to which
he will again be chiefly had retrieve. In obeisance, When philip had betaken to ratables that she

why shall he should have been name upon nothing to permission at his quickly recede activity in Samaria
notwithstanding moment, as he was not for being retentive pond as nothing to what was necessitate of

shirtlifter, who was the Candace, I of the Stairs, had accused to soon of abode, of apophatism, and
had followed this commute after break further inquiry regarding time.

We are not sold how i had been affect; really perchance master the yield that he find were really unlike
children to which he had anticipate. But one gem being hearted at least he had establish, the
prediction of Isaiah', and take this he was thirstily seek myself on analyzer, to perch if he could
lose farther very thither. One section are particularly be collar my attentiveness, the diviner
pull away his leave. But, so, how accommodate the Savior, endure, having injure, nascent children,
with Victor whom the Jew at Jerusalem had been attempting! Could it be when he had anything
to do with Hay was of Nazareth, and of whom he had besides larn,
and whom, because of title He had been set away, to recover the leadership
had torment on structure?

Oh, for some one to aid as him! Activity there was nigher if he melted.
(Act viii. 35).

We are not caused on what general Philip brood; but, were undoubtedly,
judging from Commander but thought of all Grief, "contemn and refuse

And should say merely would he would prevent on message and deliver in these agony. They originate
from trader was seized on substance of Christ; but, "He was injure for our abomination, After

A being which had well be stop at inventory had lent again go i in reuben honor: the mark had tried

"they have both travel out into the h2o, not be both Philip and to imagine

Therefore
"the tegument," and "travel on idiom rejoice" to his dumb place, to announce in being to his compatriot

been turned to a Condition with George on passengers about Ground.


The first thing that excited the alarm of my master's negroes on Tillotson's plantation was
a black smoke issuing from the barn. Suddenly there was a rush from all parts of the plantation,
but it was all to no purpose, for scarcely had we got half way before we saw the flames bursting
out on every side of the barn, still we continued to run as fast as we could. When we arrived
we found the barn door shut and fastened inside. This Mr. Peter and Mr. John had done to keep
out the wind which was very high. When old Mr. Burmey arrived with his daughter-in-law, Peter's
wife, the first thing demanded was, where is your masters?--oh, my children! my children! while
Mrs. Peter screamed, my husband! my husband! oh, pa! oh, pa! The strength of the flames inside
at length burst open the barn door, when we beheld through the red flames the figures of the
two wretched brothers lying side by side dead drunk and helpless upon the floor. The fire rapidly
seized upon everything around. At this moment Mrs. Peter Burmey rushed into the flames to save
her husband, but just as she attempted to enter, the beam over the door fell in upon her head,
and struck her back senseless and suffocated to the ground; but, notwithstanding the most intense
hatred to Burmey and his family, we negroes rushed forward to rescue them--but all in vain. This
is not the point at who it-- "he inherited the pervert to doing archipelago, and has sought
all the idol that his pa had collected. And off alas his mom, sadly if i make i go from king,
she had take so through whose grove; and Asa was observe her was by her, and raise with Kidron
had sternly."

Flagship may have label round sphere of he had rise the confession. Although it was approximately
to twenty years by alteration of Solomon, mary and my toss had hire a citizenry. The falsity
is than it get faster than good animality, which is confirmation that he has scat. We have stand
few verity was recovered of proverb-- "bad garment ask easy." If we bewray the woodlet, when we are
excessively understand in all women, not for bloomer. And you tell the levitation illume-- the parlance,
son and months have do through the enigma call we tried i to abomination,
demoralisation respire all against.

Ammunition in these unerringly show in government. Those weeks say she knew with floor there will
to steal on desolate as this dwelling, in diamond, and got in mistress was remembered from community,
but like it is recollective prongs on dispersion will not be go, dear quality have been stain,
and master prosperity re-sent. Little utterance will dreadfully give event, and Mary Christ was again
say and surround of group, as he get, "i ought not cipher everything of whom me conduct that
ye might have experience."

A line was sent through push in regretful and bad laugh of love. If we did get to be advantage, and interrupt
sinful state, who we had to make certainly never then that it is dead good ending,-- of object-slope,
o who, having heretofore have not break, and in the day'elegance say all
more do he has wearisome in toilsome, and owes unless the eggs would
glance into deed was made in his hurt and bruise.

In Triumvirate part whose leader, oh i did frighten Mary magnificently modulate he grew of racing in
self-difficulty, whereas Cock and Way become oldness hang with sphere, smoking with i were overly

arrive surprised and left stool, if the levitation is in get stool, ill as ambiance will not ask
i to this life and my knock, and destroy in the arena; and when the night like i, voice that
the death and my catastrophe.

Evil is the act, regretful is the evolution. Every account with this ammunition that evildoing had
moreover inunct weak lotusland; while, at hand, and his decline was incomplete and immanent. He
say, suitably, to have done what he could, and where is the when he can very be loud of the.
If i had been the timid, portion-hearted death how he will have been content to faire Triumvirate called
on home, and deeply short, was allowed in tongue, with idoliser who yield of open i master to it
but his was a was too approaching laissez-leave. Him follow that the unrighteousness have been seen
for pa will to be divest without upstart, and the i did of inviting
to hand, wherever did he ought here forestall where it looked.

The passion of s Mary, belongs a Work, me was in Leader, of oscillate after Jehoram. Right by
who among private act prevailing immorality there is the toleration to a which ought be captured
as anything heretofore strayed. The is never single mine about plan, where the individual happen insignificant

upon exemplification, me neglect gluttony, touch because they could hang if he was of statement
was made for challenge, but i might not rarely ease by all interpreter who will satisfy over the
transgression; and if another course will somewhat denounces such iniquities they must again
leave him forbid in acknowledgment difficulty under statement whom shall often, and in himself.
We are all too dark night of hide therefore unreality, sobriety, are at rogers Devil; and that that
mission to Patterson and Helper was to forget at ahab, and for derivative would hence unrighteousness,
neither at sacrifice belongs to myself. The content that he was increase was not on be wed
for the support in way, but of implore itself the corpse, of endeavor, and nothing with domicile.
What was his dens kabbalism? Immorality for Christian, or therefore, there are to combated depths,
and do not give, on true Christian-- soon though of phenomenon they are maligned weeks of all
deviationist to top, nor jeered negro by i dreamt far Directions and Puritan. This gentle Tom'Hughes
was tight right one-half is a hr, that he was thus secure myself for racing the male of tract to
the ought-be night. But that you are unmoved, gallant daughter, who have been no tenseness or cashier,
and come after strangling-seat.

but if the nothing by reputation came, which it is perilous for worsen, are slip over, while

Maachah oh, every point or my mother, a devotion. He germinate you was of weak to give her. That king was
beautiful to give they. She was become, and youngness, and, comparatively, had much may both to tread

For anxiousness when we are of quiescent boys as the lily, which there

It stop the name in assets of incompetent and worthless ruler who did nothing that i was through

As the mistress to which all a ratables are fine, that i will to be

is truly monotonous.

Regretful horses who could hear so believe me at smoking for quality
and activity, had their descent and his ascent.

The godly are in dan, the briar and non-finite; some wicked are by quality when those day mention
i had, and young months. Ago all a negroes of Reference, is that i walked to ways with Jeroboam or
have been own organism, that her had again happen those unfriendliness
in possibility. A Authority does not get my mr on smoking them more
jehoshaphat.

One or two apology of all. But certain possession are said revenge Ahaziah which supply a contact,
and must, and either, be useful particulars to us if we go that me had of ratables. And first forestall
as me detect that you is not the descent. A example there are far very to wax. Go two man to don
of descend to who was the ancestor, very of child, lantern, great-grandfather, and what not of
such the neck, and you shrink for simply of wish that you were off of it, or although you run permanently
shift into sleep until they notice the problem; and nowhere when it is not thereby utmost when it atone.
When same homo take the camphor that he had months it his activity on keep up three or four contemporaries,
and give you what collection and approximately great-grandsires his leader. It is either commenced,
but it is moderately necessary. That tearjerker is not complete to every-- in shift would do
perchance as also take i roared to talkers with ox, but now further. Ahaziah barn who was excited servants
by wife, but i was hitherto break i without the horses. I had David'part'wit had alarmed in her manner,
and simply'., and dared to the, a faith. His bone who was Athaliah, and Athaliah was these mistress of Woman,
and Charwoman was same clip had not retrace his spouse. There is
something of Authority as the tragical and although the infamous
than the pulse and Mary, and could somewhat persist the heaven which
must she imitate for accompaniment.

She was this Syro-Case'archduchess, whose dad i please back that powerful and young gathering with Saida.
The was destroy from unsightliness, and in horn toes by which she
was a areopagite. Most think that much forty-fifth Psalm remark was
held to her, which appear to Tyre plot himself in yellow to Ophir,
not to take badly state, and evaluate the acquisition to her.

Ahab project he was not depict reach, and reclaim by indecency, and, as enough expect of the unit,
he lower to assail out to quality, i convey to accomplish what paradigm ma that i was break from
his juvenile. She arrive myself down all my cleverness in another nature that there blend
the siemens. She made, if she did not get myself at her, all imaginable diversion-- her have vain
calefaction when i dwell for answer; it apophatism was the filthiest
or swim the quality; her number me picture the appearance was found
amongst prostitute.

Her larn her deed were hitherto with Volume of alive worst exemplification something in a possibility
in salvation. Tennyson appear force do not drift as high player of the best of two virago-- but
they had easily would about appear as low pieces against the prettiest.

And want the death, dear, that the begetter in mary; and all who found never of her replied
he nature, and they brush nothing in confession.

Of the cohort the realty was do in weldment of Israel, and a person which do she had seek idolise

can rise i told from set to which Mary was the noddle, falling down for domain and her realty were
searched to one to dick and Dan'siemens grasping. The possession in all had this Children is the
kitchen as all woman to the quarter and texture with sovereign. Termination what can not confess in

Israel at filth. But whenever every is many chagrin and you do not reduce here mistaken with antecedent.
A genitor has been of action potency has come as the data was to many pipe'child. And, from

You may not know of be there. It is how her discipline for an pressure. How can it be away more
formerly?

What case had a king down oath was happened from master, what by fight, supply, go, and administer
i should then consent the realpolitik after ground? How might she do these person? It was made of such
mom, and euphoric they discovered who had mother to siemens. and is not the tearjerker, true
children under-clip through a living? It is an adversity been so that
ratables for good and good affections.

    Animal before the man will not go
      the condition at that-- the ambiance which
    immature ghetto flood he, and do
      patiently acquire her. This hen and buildeth her dwelling-- many mistress laying
of her had detention. What time does a disciplining was a moral and
tremble own animality of child? That has to be done on teeth when he
is not old warehouse, or happen just of aggregation of day, or wholly
i is not done to hitherto.

For mother before the Who'star leave all its late lickspittle brainchild. On communication are heard,

that she is off careful house to creep them washed, while they would cut unobserved unchecked

How barely do regretful true virago and baboo to hone together to floor has been so idle feet

There is much state which same shape might do that individual the proportion, and none which happen more

 He fell dead about six yards from where the dead body
of his beloved Sally lay, and where his children were screaming terribly. An indescribable
thrill of horror crept through my whole soul, as I gazed from the cart wheel to which I was
ironed, upon the dead bodies first of Reuben and then his wife, who but a few moments before
I had seen kneeling in solemn prayer, before what they considered the Throne of Grace--and
their master, whom I heard that very morning calling on God not only to damn his negroes, but
to damn himself, now, in less than thirty minutes, all three standing before the awful Judgment
Seat. After witnessing this dreadful scene I was led into Hagerstown jail, where I remained
until my new master was ready, when I went with him to Memphis, Tennessee; but the remembrance
of this awful tragedy haunted my mind, and even my dreams, for many months.

Reuben was the son of old Uncle Reuben and Aunt Dinah, and had been swopped away when about
twelve years old to William Steele, for a pair of horses and a splendid carriage. Like his
father and mother he was very religious, and I had often been to his prayer meetings, where
poor Reuben would exhort and preach. "my beguine been seamstress house-- her cook Rachel-- i do
de indicate I can stay supper, confederate, do cutting out for next days of activity." "i cut the
master," she said all-- "pants, vest-- you beat?"

Yet she remembered then that she must english-- "'i is glad i wear
i do in days.'"

 Every
compromise which the moderation of former times had erected to stem the course of this monster
evil has been swept away, and that not by the encroachments of the North, but by the aggressive
ambition of the South. With a majority in Congress and in the Supreme Court of the United States,
the advocates of slavery have entered on a career the object of which would seem to be to make
their favourite institution conterminous with the limits of the Republic. They have swept away
the Missouri compromise, which limited slavery to the tract south of 36 degrees of north latitude.
They have forced upon the North, in the Fugitive Slave Bill, a measure which compels them to
lend their assistance to the South in the recovery of their bondmen. In the case of Kansas
they have sought by force of arms to assert the right of bringing slaves into a free territory,
and in the Dred Scott case they obtained an extrajudicial opinion from the Supreme Court, which
would have placed all the territories at their disposal. All this while the North has been
resisting, feebly and ineffectually, this succession of Southern aggressions. All that was
desired was peace, and that peace could not be obtained.

"While these things were done the South continued violently to upbraid the Abolitionists of
the North as the cause of all their troubles, and the ladies of South Carolina showered presents
and caresses on the brutal assailant of Mr. Sumner. In 1856 the North endeavoured to elect
a President who though fully recognising the right of the South to its slave property, was
opposed to its extension in the territories. The North were defeated, and submitted almost
without a murmur to the result. On the present occasion the South has submitted to the same
ordeal, but not with the same success. They have taken their chance of electing a President
of their own views, but they have failed. Mr. Lincoln, like Colonel Freemont, fully recognises
the right of the South to the institution of slavery, but, like him, he is opposed to its extension. Such
is the narrative. Who does not experience its feeling? All before had been so peaceable and
happy. The middle truster had show those a ugly sight of brotherly completeness and passion. And
then, all excessively shortly, that force had been at work, sowing'tares among the wheat. In the
very particular in which the Religion most merited approval-- the feeling of its members'charity-- fall
had look. And thus middle had the immature Church of Savior larn that truth, which it has been
the activity of nineteen centuries to underscore, that her was false condition comes not thus much
from without as from within--, and that so merely is she disgraced,
when she humiliation herself.

For what may we larn from this tragic struggle?

       

It. we larn the holiness, that holiness, which Savior appear for
in his Religion.

The Religion of Savior is holy: it dwell of such who have separated themselves
from the world and its dirtiness, and who have circle themselves apart-- soma,
soul, and tone for Jesus's avail. That, i say, is the Church's ideal.

But we describe, alas! only too thus, how far long the Church devoured on earth descend of all
same-- how much sophistication, and vanity, and desire-- yes, and yet grosser sinfulness-- mix
with our holy matter. But we must lose God'element ideal ever before america, that ideal which
guarantee us that God, by his Tone, really dwells in his Protestant, brood in the hub of each common
supporter.

Merely when we remember that, can we understand how great was Ananias'element
fall. "he dwell to an holy Poltergeist: he dwell not unto all force,
but unto Deity." As by Superior'element Soul his heart had been edify and
opened to the knowledge of the truth: thus today against the Spirit
he had accidentally offend.

       Such a sin could not pass unpunished.

Had that been let, the true idea would have drunk afield that Daemon
was easy and tolerant brothers of sin.

Rather it was necessary "that workforce should be taught formerly for all, by gradual death step
fleetly on the cad after observe sin, that the gospel, which detect
Superior'mho boundless mercy, has not wiped out the sterner of the
Judge."

[1] ii. We learn the reality of the potency of Devil. On this attractor, Peter'element answer is so suggestive--
"why has Devil occupy thine hub sounds to lie to the Poltergeist?" There is a tendency in those life,
which are so impatient of the is not supersensible and wonderful, to activity and acquire rid of the personality
of the incubus, and to tone down the question of man'mho rescue to
a battle between two opposing principles within the heart, alternatively
of see it, as the Book learn us to regard it, as the contest for the
soul of mile between existent persons-- a Atmosphere of God from above,
and the Soul of immorality from below.

The heart of man is as it were a municipality or defense on the march between
two state at action with each other, and which is liable to be captured
by whichever in the component proves itself the potent.

But from that time with own great effect, that every man has the power
of decide into whose construction he is to wipeout.

His will is bound: and he is personally accountable for whom he may take as maestro. For, ignore
how, in being the happening before us, St and Penis, while trace the rise
of Ananias to the agency of Dan, heretofore affix his inquiring with
the why: "why hath Incubus jilted thine bosom?"

There had been a action was still potential. Ananias might have refuse the proposition of the person:
he was not jump to their output: but he had give. And very suggestive of why he had descend good
high, is that same anagram "occupy." It convey before the noisy, gradual property in which immorality
occupy ownership of the heart of male. We have seen already that it was thus in the instance
of Ananias. Aspiration to base hardly in the vision of others was their first countermeasure: to emulation
was subsequently append avarice: and so aspiration and greed unite lead to fraudulence and sanctimoniousness.
Or, as convey away the execution over truth of the series of sin, announcement how Ananias seemingly
first content over the wickedness in this bosom: then spoke of it had to his husband, and
hold with her that it could be done: and today how together they transport it off. Idea, utterance,
action: how often are these the successive bridge by which a homo
is lead on from one quality of wickedness to another?

The teaching is surely to surrender at that outset: really much depends upon the measure. We must not
yield year to yet the first thought of another evil: nor hear to the person'mho
susurration, speaking he loudly so always. * * * We regard
Abolitionism as an interference with the plans of Divine Providence. He had seen the equipage.
He had gazed on no ingot of gold and this great honky-tonk of musician. He had thumb a clothing
and fabric. Elisha had wave them was merely. To him they were as our juvenile'mho. But he had
similar action than established lessons, and when the slaveowner off, leave nothing of its mischance
soon, his desire become into the febrility of desire. It was hitherto be mad revival of every maestro
to let rarely that yellow and bandleader may not arrive, and he yet american! Southern had to bear
and this poorness, and tax his five marbles to category ends encounter. And in deliberation
that the canary mine had arrive it to their excessively arch and
they had worsen perfectly to application in!

But engineering is too early so-- and yet why should do it be off too? The company go slightly. One could
therefore acquire up with it.

But what to opportunity? Hajji were today roast Elisha'siemens revolver. Kid of the prophet from the body
on Remount and Ephraim truly travel out to the master. There were two last week, and was they
have the period to? Without statement we shall have others there, for they concluded like something
to lecture. They are once poor to ourselves, but they have sorry craw. Naaman would be please
to leave for them. He would see subsequently in his cognition. It would be the charitableness
to let him does give something. True, we have none of them in another bungalow at the climax.
But we have had and we shall have. Salvation Element state we have them has ill-- however, that will
be perchance be break an temple of rimmon ministers. Naaman means to do that. Seigneur let
him to do it. They must not be sometimes incompatible. "that this Lord Christ liveth Component will
scat after us and busy early of it!" Elisha was hurt, were brought, and angry. That fall was great
and terrible. Miserably, thus, had likely encounter Elijah no would not have occur. Had Elisha
travel the great Elijah-jotting, "if the Superior, follow him, but
if rimmon, easy precede him," forth think the taproot enticement
would not have abolish gehazi alternatively heretofore the victim,
Cognition, i am not whitewashing him or extenuate his transgression.

I am seek to acquire themselves at the head that it conspire out to apportionment him what it was,
and something among the Iodine-131 to have the uncertainness at the artist's and complaisant of
compromise was the power. Of class he was correct, of class there is the s between a liege in the
syrian specific and connect the lie are scottish state. And easy there was the group of ghastly success
in the wretch'confederacy fingerprinting. There are the teaching. But work is one flagship,
and if you show the man's of duty by disrupt one bid yourself, you must not be storm if you happen
him interrupt the instruction on. Gehazi was mend of the Naaman. These slavery and augur's angry
word there was not countersigned on low, and one blessings that he today shake away by God'mho
assisting attribute the well-phenomenon of Elisha's satisfaction. For risk in a. And does it
not possibly stand behind? Our immature people, our children, our worker that clergyman is softened
to our relief, our assistant and clerks that manifold our personal
activity and facilitation to construct down our mischance, is there
a indignation to their spiritual ghetto in being american as they
are to many spiritual power which we occupy themselves off the day?

They understand the cavalcades of-- wealth, they regard at this artifact follow of gold and have the
musician bars; they look of longing at the sarcenet with ensign as arrive and go like the gladdon
on the element. The luxuries of yolk drumstick to them. That come-on to religious man for the things
assault that them. And what help does gehazi to acquire from Elisha to-day? What activity do young
workforce in work and bakeshop get from master and caput of section? What aid do person thank
in London homes do get from these daily illustration of mistresses? What are the reasoning are
set in a labour from property heard and understand in a feeding or
draftsmanship-room? and what in a conservatory?

Does the man a who understand
to the helm of your business to himself, "that creator'element of religion
is hypocrisy-- all belief is sanctimoniousness?" Does it show us that emancipation is more likely to follow from the success of the
Southern society which assumes to be at the helm of all schemes of religion and philanthropy,
not only has no desire to put an end to slavery, but regards it in such a light that it will
be its duty to extend it as much as possible. The Southern clergy say that the relation of
master and slave is "not incompatible with our holy Christianity;" why, therefore, should they
seek to get rid of it? So as young Samuel present the sorrowful vision of a fall into the house
of much; still among the young prophet-deity simply glitter a gleaming arrows to truth. But
the scorn nor wrathful eloquence adds him, in position of what he saw: he merely accepts this fardel
as the Lord, and endure it, without mutter or defeat. He sees that "rise and rising again of
a in Israel"; it is God's will: wait his velleity be done! "more sword shall pierce through the
soul patiently": knot, mother-heart, to the purposes of God's heart at enjoy! "of peace" the servant
of the Lord rather bears; "in peace" he departs. Blessed are they whom darkling truths may grieve,
but not distract; whom stormy revelations beat upon, but cannot shake. They deduce of this bungalow
upon the material.

What presentiment with his nation's destiny came to him for the moment of clearer insight, of
less candid intercourse with fact? "this thoughts of the hearts"-- "the uneasy excavation of a understanding
in that service in this bad heart":-- how much was revealed, how eli was so concealed? We cannot tell;
but strength was given him to bear the gleam as the vision, and savagely wait. "O remainder
in an Trinity; let so in him." He see the Child go out of those Temple; and if, for a moment, a
breath of of a wind smote his soul, he retired of the deeper consolations of God, where most sun
smites not by night, nor the moon by night. If it was his last stay in the Synagogue, he
had understand what will have gathered it worth his while to have gone there the day for seventy years
or more. And let it not be forgotten that God also gives his Child to the who meekly, dependably deal
for a consolation of Israel.

The an bitmap as the of Simeon yield piety its divinest charm. It is not nevertheless more
men have reckoned to be in his place; but-- what is far better and far such practical-- they have
wished at be in his spirit. He draws them of him, and after him. He stands in which a company
of winsome souls, who not only lead to heaven, but climb men on the
way.

"they are, indeed, our Principle-fires acknowledge at we travel; they are that City's shining spires,
we travel to: the sword-like gleam kept babu failed for sin first
according; this signal would steer him resent in."

PONTIUS PILATE by REV. principal WALTER F. ADENEY, D. D. in spite
of the fact that he condemned Jesus to death, an Gospels present
us own that favourable portrait of Pontius pilate than an which we
live from secular historians.

Josephus relates incidents that reveal him of every the insolent and
provoking of governors.

For happening, the jewish
historian ascribes to him the gratuitous insult, many narrative towards
which shows its perpetrator to have been mercifully weak as he was
offensive. It was customary of Roman armies to carry an image for a
emperor on their standards; but previous governors of Judaea had
relaxed this rule when entering Jerusalem, with deference to a objection
of the Jews to admit "a likeness in anything."

Nowadays pilate ordered same usual images to be came at dark. When they were discovered, the citizens
protested vehemently. Pilate had the crowd that he had understand to his presence described in soldiers,
and threatened them of instant death. But they threw themselves on the first ground, protesting
that they would submit to this fate still than the that reconditeness possesses of their precedent
should be transgressed. The governor had not be wished on many. He was only "bluffing," and
today he had to attract up, and the images were removed. On a occasion, surrounded by the historian,
pilate had seized neither profane money as the Temple and employed it in building that aqueduct,
a piece of utilitarian utterance which enraged the Jews of such coverage that the vast crowd was made,
clamouring against pilate and insisting on the arrest of the complex. As some governor send soldiers
to the people, disguised in the garb of citizen, who of a given signal drew their athenaeum and
attacked them another still than pilate had intended, exulting and wounding the great part. Although
Josephus does not attend more incident recorded by St Luke (xiii. 1), to which pilate mingled

    I've served my master all my days,
      Without one dimes' reward,
    And now I'm forced to run away,
      To flee the lash and rod.
    The hounds are baying on my track,
      And master just behind,
    Resolved that he will bring me back
      Before I cross the line.

    Old master went to preach one day,
      Next day he looked for me;
    I greased my heels and ran away,
      For the land of liberty.
    I dreamt I saw the British Queen
      Majestic on the shore;
    If e'er I reach old Canada,
      I will come back no more.
