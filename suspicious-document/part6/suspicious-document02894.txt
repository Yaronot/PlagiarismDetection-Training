[14] Touch gives much by way of interpretation only when an individual object, for example
a man's hat, is recognized by aid of this sense alone, in which case the perception distinctly
involves the reproduction of a complete visual percept. I may add that the organ of smell comes
next to that of hearing, with respect both to the range and definiteness of its simultaneous
sensations, and to the amount of information furnished by these. A rough sense of distance
as well as of direction is clearly obtainable by means of this organ.

by extending the latter, so as to include sense-perceptions which are contradicted by reason
employing idealized elements of sense-impression, which, as Lewes has shown (Problems of Life
