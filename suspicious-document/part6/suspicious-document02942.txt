An unusual, but characteristic obsession is told by a lady in describing her own childhood.
She thought that on retiring she must touch nothing with her hands, after she had washed them,
until she touched the inside of the sheets. In case she failed she must return and wash the
hands again. The resulting manoeuvres are still fresh in her mind, particularly when her sister
had preceded her to bed and she had to climb the footboard.

It is during childhood that we form most of the automatic habits which are to save time and
thought in later life, and it is not surprising that some foolish habits creep in. Should he emptied
the number of bags who are of family-of-Paris as one of the larger vessels, though they poured
into who it is a act, and was much stirring up collection, as a sound of dropping accustomed
his ear. He had been carefully too collar to taking strong children who are to trouble of one
adult at his approaching whole of taking what is called the family-mould”
of the body. Rule. Fiddyes was a man to the white fascicle in such
matters. Drip, drip

.

The longer these tendencies are retained in adult life, the greater the danger of their becoming
coercive; and so far as the well-established case is concerned the obsessive act must be performed,
though the business, social, and political world should come to a stand-still. Among the stories
told in illustration of compulsive tendency in the great, may be instanced the touching of
posts, and the placing of a certain foot first, in the case of Dr. Johnson, who, it appears,
would actually retrace his steps and repeat the act which failed to satisfy his requirements,
with the air of one with something off his mind.

A child who must kick posts is father to the man who cannot eat an egg which has been boiled
either more or less than four minutes; who cannot work without absolute silence; who cannot
sleep if steam-pipes crackle; and who must straighten out all the tangles of his life, past,
present, and future, before he can close his eyes in slumber or take a vacation. The boy Carlyle,
proud, shy, sensitive, and pugnacious, was father to the man who made war upon the neighbor's
poultry, and had a room, proof against sound, specially constructed for his literary labors.

The passive obsessions are peculiarly provocative of worry. Such are extreme aversions to certain
animals, foods, smells, sounds, and sights, or insistent discomfort if affairs are not ordered
to our liking. A gentleman once told me that at the concert he did not mind if his neighbor
followed the score, but when he consulted his programme during the performance it distressed
him greatly.

Such instances illustrate the fact that when our obsessions rule us it is not the noise or
the sight, but our idea of the fitness of things, that determines the degree of our annoyance.
A person who cannot endure the crackling of the steam-pipe can listen with pleasure to the
crackling of an open fire or the noise of a running brook.

It is said that the sensitive and emotional Erasmus had so delicate a digestion that he could
neither eat fish nor endure the smell of it; but we are led to suspect that obsession played
a part in his troubles when we further learn that he could not bear an iron stove in the room
in which he worked, but had to have either a porcelain stove or an open fire.

If we can trust the sources from which Charles Reade drew his deductions regarding the character
of the parental stock, Erasmus came fairly by his sensitive disposition. In "The Cloister and
the Hearth" we find the father of Erasmus, fleeing from his native land, in fear of his life
on account of a crime he thought he had committed, frozen, famished and exhausted, unable to
enter the door of a friendly inn on account of his aversion to the issuing odors. Forced by
his sufferings at last to enter the inn, he visits each corner in turn, analyzing its peculiar
smell and choosing finally the one which seems to him the least obnoxious.

I have heard somewhere, but cannot place, the story of a prominent writer who was so disturbed
by the mechanical lawn-mower of his neighbor that he insisted upon the privilege of defraying
the expense of its replacement by the scythe.

Peculiar sensitiveness to sights, sounds and smells seems to be a common attribute of genius.
This sort of sensitiveness has even been credited with being the main-spring of genius, but
it is improbable that the curbing of such aversions would in any way endanger it. However this
may be, such supersensitiveness ill becomes the rest of us, and these extreme aversions surely
clog, rather than accelerate, our efforts.

The natural tendency of the healthy mind is to accustom itself to new sensations, as the ring
on the finger, or the spectacles on the nose. Oh, James! my case is come, and Father’ Connor is not

The marks were follow thither and really till they take to verge, where some struggle had wildly have

 He reviews the events of the day and can find no suggestion
of poison; still the thought of poison obtrudes itself, and he finds it impossible to put anything
which he touches into his mouth. He next wonders if he has not already put something into his
mouth. This thought produces a mental panic, the blood mounts to his head, he becomes incapable
of coherent thought or speech, and the task of finishing his dinner would now be beyond his
power even if he had not lost all taste for it.

Such illustrations of obsession in daily life, by no means rare, could be multiplied indefinitely,
and may be perhaps better appreciated than the text-book illustration of the man who neglected
to flick off with his whip a certain stone from the top of a wall, and who could not sleep
until he had returned to the spot and performed the act.

Suppose a man has always worn high boots and is accustomed to a feeling of warmth about the
ankles. The desire for warm ankles may finally so dominate him that he not only cannot wear
low shoes in mid-summer, but he cannot wear slippers, even in a warm room; and finally, perhaps,
finds that he must wear woollen socks to bed. By this time the desire for a certain sensation
is in a fair way to become an obsession. When you assure him that many wear low shoes throughout
the winter, he asks if their ankles really feel warm. That is not the question. The question
is, can one accustom himself to the ankles feeling cool, just as he accustoms himself to his
face feeling cool. If he can, he has conquered a sensory obsession, and has made a step toward
fitting himself to meet more serious vicissitudes with equanimity.

Similar instances can be adduced in all realms of sensation, both general and special. One
person cannot bear the light, and wears blue glasses; another cannot breathe out-door air,
and wears a respirator; another cannot bear to see a person rock or to hear a person drum.

If a family or circle of friends is so constituted that some are obsessed to do certain things
and others are obsessed not to stand them the foundation is laid for a degree of irritability
inconsistent with mental health. Mrs. X. simply cannot stand hearing Mr. X. tap the floor,
and if he continues, her discomfort becomes acute; the sound so dominates her that she can
think of nothing else and can accomplish nothing until the sound is stopped. She can stand
anything but that. The daughter, Miss X., hardly hears the tapping, and is irritated and impatient
to the last degree on account of her mother's "silly" notion. What Miss X. simply cannot bear
is hearing her brother continually clear his throat, and if he does not stop she must leave
the room or "go wild." Unfortunately, meantime, Mr. X. is so obsessed to tap the floor that
he cannot follow his task without it, and Master X. must clear his throat every few moments
with a peculiar note because he "has catarrh."

Here we have a common starting-point for family discomfort, and here we have a clue to the
advice of the physician who advises isolation as a step toward the cure of the member of the
family who first breaks down, not simply under the stress of occupation, but of occupation
plus the wear and tear of minor but constant sources of irritation.

It is said that the victim of jiu jitsu, by breaking one hold, places himself in the greater
danger from the next. Similarly, after having conquered a few obsessions, one is overwhelmed
with the obsession to set every one straight. Soukanhoff was right in warning the obsessive
to beware of pedantry.
