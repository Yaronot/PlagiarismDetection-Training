Upon this, M. le Duc d'Orleans looked fixedly at the Marechal and said, in the tone of a master,
that he mistook himself and forgot himself; that he ought to remember to whom he was speaking,
and take care what words he used; that the respect he (the Regent) owed to the presence of
the King, hindered him from replying as he ought to reply, and from continuing this conversation.
Therefore he made a profound reverence to the King, and went away.

The Marechal, thoroughly angry, conducted him some steps, mumbling and gesticulating; M. le
Duc d'Orleans pretending to neither see nor hear him, the King astonished, and M. de Frejus
laughing in his sleeve.  The bait so well swallowed,--no one doubted that the Marechal, audacious
as he was, but nevertheless a servile and timid courtier, would feel all the difference between
braving, bearding, and insulting Cardinal Dubois (odious to everybody, and always smelling
of the vile egg from which he had been hatched) and wrestling with the Regent in the presence
of the King, claiming to annihilate M. le Duc d'Orleans' rights and authority, by appealing
to his own pretended rights and authority as governor of the King.  People were not mistaken;
less than two hours after what had occurred, it was known that the Marechal, bragging of what
he had just done, had added that he should consider himself very unhappy if M. le Duc d'Orleans
thought he had been wanting in respect to him, when his only idea was to fulfil his precious
duty; and that he would go the next day to have an explanation with his Royal Highness, which
he doubted not would be satisfactory to him.

At every hazard, all necessary measures had been taken as soon as the day was fixed on which
the snare was to be laid for the Marechal.  Nothing remained but to give form to them directly
it was known that on the morrow the Marechal would come and throw himself into the lion's mouth.

Beyond the bed-room of M. le Duc d'Orleans was a large and fine cabinet, with four big windows
looking upon the garden, and on the same floor, two paces distant, two other windows; and two
at the side in front of the chimney, and all these windows opened like doors.  This cabinet
occupied the corner where the courtiers awaited, and behind was an adjoining cabinet, where
M. le Duc d'Orleans worked and received distinguished persons or favourites who wished to talk
with him.

All things being well arranged, the Marechal de Villeroy arrived about mid-day, with his accustomed
hubbub, but alone, his chair and porters remaining outside, beyond the Salle des Gardes.  He
enters like a comedian, stops, looks round, advances some steps.  Under pretext of civility,
he is environed, surrounded.  He asks in an authoritative tone, what M. le Duc d'Orleans is
doing: the reply is, he is in his private room within.

The Marechal elevates his tone, says that nevertheless he must see the Regent; that he is going
to enter; when lo! La Fare, captain of M. le Duc d'Orleans' guards, presents himself before
him, arrests him, and demands his sword.  The Marechal becomes furious, all present are in
commotion. At this instant Le Blanc presents himself.  His sedan chair, that had been hidden,
is planted before the Marechal.  He cries aloud, he is shaking on his lower limbs; but he is
thrust into the chair, which is closed upon him and carried away in the twinkling of an eye
through one of the side windows into the garden, La Fare and Artagnan each on one side of the
chair, the light horse and musketeers behind, judging only by the result what was in the wind.
The march is hastened; the party descend the steps of the orangery by the side of the thicket;
the grand gate is found open and a coach and six before it.  The chair is put down; the Marechal
storms as he will; he is cast into the coach; Artagnan mounts by his side; an officer of the
musketeers is in front; and one of the gentlemen in ordinary of the King by the side of the
officer; twenty musketeers, with mounted officers, surround the vehicle, and away they go.

This side of the garden is beneath the window of the Queen's apartments (when occupied by the
Infanta).  This scene under the blazing noon-day sun was seen by no one, and although the large
number of persons in M. le Duc d'Orleans' rooms soon dispersed, it is astonishing that an affair
of this kind remained unknown more than ten hours in the chateau of Versailles.  The servants
of the Marechal de Villeroy (to whom nobody had dared to say a word) still waited with their
master's chair near the Salle des Gardes.  They were, told, after M. le Duc d'Orleans had seen
the King, that the Marechal had gone to Villeroy, and that they could carry to him what was
necessary.

I received at Meudon the message arranged.  I was sitting down to table, and it was only towards
the supper that people came from Versailles to tell us all the news, which was making much
sensation there, but a sensation very measured on account of the surprise and fear paused by
the manner in which the arrest had been executed.

It was no agreeable task, that which had to be performed soon after by the Regent; I mean when
he carried the news of the arrest to the King. He entered into his Majesty's cabinet, which
he cleared of all the company it contained, except those people whose post gave them aright
to enter, but of them there were not many present.  At the first word, the King reddened; his
eyes moistened; he hid his face against the back of an armchair, without saying a word; would
neither go out nor play.  He ate but a few mouthfuls at supper, wept, and did not sleep all
night.  The morning and the dinner of the next day, the 14th, passed off but little better.

CHAPTER CXIV

That same 14th, as I rose from dinner at Meudon, with much company, the valet de chambre who
served me said that a courier from Cardinal Dubois had a letter for me, which he had not thought
good to bring me before all my guests.  I opened the letter.  The Cardinal conjured me to go
instantly and see him at Versailles, bringing with me a trusty servant, ready to be despatched
to La Trappe, as soon as I had spoken with him, and not to rack my brains to divine what this
might mean, because it would be impossible to divine it, and that he was waiting with the utmost
impatience to tell it to me.  I at once ordered my coach, which I thought a long time in coming
from the stables.  They are a considerable distance from the new chateau I occupied.

This courier to be taken to the Cardinal, in order to be despatched to La Trappe, turned my
head.  I could not imagine what had happened to occupy the Cardinal so thoroughly so soon after
the arrest of Villeroy.  The constitution, or some important and unknown fugitive discovered
at La Trappe, and a thousand other thoughts, agitated me until I arrived at Versailles.

Upon reaching the chateau, I saw Dubois at a window awaiting me, and making many signs to me,
and upon reaching the staircase, I found him there at the bottom, as I was about to mount.
His first word was to ask me if I had brought with me a man who could post to La Trappe.  I
showed him my valet de chambre, who knew the road well, having travelled over it with me very
often, and who was well known to the Cardinal, who, when simple Abbe Dubois, used very frequently
to chat with him while waiting for me.

The Cardinal explained to me, as we ascended the stairs, the cause of his message.  Immediately
after the departure of the Marechal de Villeroy, M. le Frejus, the King's instructor, had been
missed.  He had disappeared.  He had not slept at Versailles.  No one knew what had become
of him!  The grief of the King had so much increased upon receiving this fresh blow--both his
familiar friends taken from him at once--that no one knew what to do with him.  He was in the
most violent despair, wept bitterly, and could not be pacified.  The Cardinal concluded by
saying that no stone must be left unturned in order to find M. de Frejus.  That unless he had
gone to Villeroy, it was probable he had hid himself in La Trappe, and that we must send and
see.  With this he led me to M. le Duc d'Orleans.  He was alone, much troubled, walking up
and down his chamber, and he said to me that he knew not what would become of the King, or
what to do with him; that he was crying for M. de Frejus, and--would listen to nothing; and
the Regent began himself to cry out against this strange flight.

After some further consideration, Dubois pressed me to go and write to La Trappe.  All was
in disorder where we were; everybody spoke at once in the cabinet; it was impossible, in the
midst of all this noise, to write upon the bureau, as I often did when I was alone with the
King.  My apartment was in the new wing, and perhaps shut up, for I was not expected that day.
I went therefore, instead, into the chamber of Peze, close at hand, and wrote my letter there.
The letter finished, and I about to descend, Peze, who had left me, returned, crying, "He is
found! he is found!  your letter is useless; return to M. le Duc d'Orleans."

He then related to me that just before, one of M. le Duc d'Orleans' people, who knew that Frejus
was a friend of the Lamoignons, had met Courson in the grand court, and had asked him if he
knew what had become of Frejus; that Courson had replied, "Certainly: he went last night to
sleep at Basville, where the President Lamoignon is;" and that upon this, the man hurried Courson
to M. le Duc d'Orleans to relate this to him.

Peze and I arrived at M. le Duc d'Orleans' room just after Courson left it.  Serenity had returned.
Frejus was well belaboured.  After a moment of cheerfulness, Cardinal Dubois advised M. le
Duc d'Orleans to go and carry this good news to the King, and to say that a courier should
at once be despatched to Basville, to make his preceptor return.  M. le Duc d'Orleans acted
upon the suggestion, saying he would return directly.  I remained with Dubois awaiting him.

After having discussed a little this mysterious flight of Frejus, Dubois told me he had news
of Villeroy.  He said that the Marechal had not ceased to cry out against the outrage committed
upon his person, the audacity of the Regent, the insolence of Dubois, or to hector Artagnan
all the way for having lent himself to such criminal violence; then he invoked the Manes of
the deceased King, bragged of his confidence in him, the importance of the place he held, and
for which he had been preferred above all others; talked of the rising that so impudent an
enterprise would cause in Paris, throughout the realm, and in foreign countries; deplored the
fate of the young King and of all the kingdom; the officers selected by the late King for the
most precious of charges, driven away, the Duc du Maine first, himself afterwards; then he
burst out into exclamations and invectives; then into praises of his services, of his fidelity,
of his firmness, of his inviolable attachment to his duty.  In fact, he was so astonished,
so troubled, so full of vexation and of rage, that he was thoroughly beside himself.  The Duc
de Villeroy, the Marechal de Tallard and Biron had permission to go and see him at Villeroy:
scarcely anybody else asked for it.

M. le Duc d'Orleans having returned from the King, saying that the news he had carried had
much appeased his Majesty, we agreed we must so arrange matters that Frejus should return the
next morning, that M. le Duc d'Orleans should receive him well, as though nothing had happened,
and give him to understand that it was simply to avoid embarrassing him, that he had not been
made aware of the secret of the arrest (explaining this to him with all the more liberty, because
Frejus hated the Marechal, his haughtiness, his jealousy, his capriciousness, and in his heart
must be delighted at his removal, and at being able to have entire possession of the--King),
then beg him to explain to the King the necessity of Villeroy's dismissal: then communicate
to Frejus the selection of the Duc de Charost as governor of the King; promise him all the
concert and the attention from this latter he could desire; ask him to counsel and guide Charost;
finally, seize the moment of the King's joy at the return of Frejus to inform his Majesty of
the new governor chosen, and to present Charost to him.  All this was arranged and very well,
executed next day.

When the Marechal heard of it at Villeroy, he flew into a strange passion against Charost (of
whom he spoke with the utmost contempt for having accepted his place), but above all against
Frejus, whom he called a traitor and a villain!  His first moments of passion, of fury, and
of transport, were all the more violent, because he saw by the tranquillity reigning everywhere
that his pride had deceived him in inducing him to believe that the Parliament, the markets,
all Paris would rise if the Regent dared to touch a person so important and so well beloved
as he imagined himself to be.  This truth, which he could no longer hide from himself, and
which succeeded so rapidly to the chimeras that had been his food and his life, threw him into
despair, and turned his head.  He fell foul of the Regent, of his minister, of those employed
to arrest him, of those who had failed to defend him, of all who had not risen in revolt to
bring him back in triumph, of Charost, who had dared to succeed him, and especially of Frejus,
who had deceived him in such an unworthy manner. Frejus was the person against whom he was
the most irritated.  Reproaches of ingratitude and of treachery rained unceasingly upon him;
all that the Marechal had done for him with the deceased King was recollected; how he had protected,
aided, lodged, and fed him; how without him (Villeroy) he (Frejus) would never have been preceptor
of the King; and all this was exactly true.

The treachery to which he alluded he afterwards explained.  He said that he and Frejus had
agreed at the very commencement of the regency to act in union; and that if by troubles or
events impossible to foresee, but which were only too common in regencies, one of them should
be dismissed from office, the other not being able to hinder the dismissal, though not touched
himself, should at once withdraw and never return to his post, until the first was reinstated
in his. After a s at Avignon, until I waited himself till a sunshine but roads amongst the Dauphine
troubles whom were both being improved, As i sat out for most city. I had, you should cognize,
outward bound, dropt up to who Embrasure Who. Wretch, therefore though it was not the light
to us thought by land, and He assure you said it was a fine one; the vast and intensive rich vales, adorned
back on all events were with such odious elevation, he could not be differently, in climate. Our first
stage he was very-- leagues were to the Orange; this is the town in the s district; and within a
quarter with a mile of it digest, in a field, a instep, so great in
devastation, that it should be an ornament in Basville Rome.

The account of these transports and insults, promptly came from Villeroy to Versailles, brought,
not only by the people whom the Regent had placed as guards over the Marechal, and to give
an exact account of all he said and did, day by day, but by all the domestics who came and
went, and before whom Villeroy launched out his speeches, at table, while passing through his
ante-chambers, or while taking a turn in his gardens.

All this weighed heavily upon Frejus by the rebound.  Despite the apparent tranquillity of
his visage, he appeared confounded.  He replied by a silence of respect and commiseration in
which he enveloped himself; nevertheless, he could not do so to the Duc de Villeroy, the Marechal
de Tallard, and a few others.  He tranquilly said to them, that he had done all he could to
fulfil an engagement which he did not deny, but that after having thus satisfied the call of
honour, he did not think he could refuse to obey orders so express from the King and the Regent,
or abandon the former in order to bring about the return of the Marechal de Villeroy, which
was the object of their reciprocal engagement, and which he was certain he could not effect
by absence, however prolonged.  But amidst these very sober excuses could be seen the joy which
peeped forth from him, in spite of himself, at being freed from so inconvenient a superior,
at having to do with a new governor whom he could easily manage, at being able when he chose
to guide himself in all liberty towards the grand object he had always desired, which was to
attach himself to the King without reserve, and to make out of this attachment, obtained by
all sorts of means, the means of a greatness which he did not yet dare to figure to himself,
but which time and opportunity would teach him how to avail himself of in the best manner,
marching to it meanwhile in perfect security.

The Marechal was allowed to refresh himself, and exhale his anger five or six days at Villeroy;
and as he was not dangerous away from the King, he was sent to Lyons, with liberty to exercise
his functions of governor of the town and province, measures being taken to keep a watch upon
him, and Des Libois being left with him to diminish his authority by this manifestation of
precaution and surveillance, which took from him all appearance of credit.  He would receive
no honours on arriving there. A large quantity of his first fire was extinguished; this wide
separation from Paris and the Court, where not even the slightest movement had taken place,
everybody being stupefied and in terror at an arrest of this importance; took from him all
remaining hope, curbed his impetuosity, and finally induced him to conduct himself with sagacity
in order to avoid worse treatment.
