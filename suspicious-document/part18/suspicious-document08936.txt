ETHAN FROME

By Edith Wharton

ETHAN FROME

I had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, as generally happens in such cases,
each time it was a different story.

If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post-office. If you know the post-office
you must have seen Ethan Frome drive up to it, drop the reins on his hollow-backed bay and
drag himself across the brick pavement to the white colonnade: and you must have asked who he was.

It was there that, several years ago, I saw him for the first time; and the sight pulled me
up sharp. Even then he was the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he was but the ruin
of a man. It was not so much his great height that marked him, for the "natives" were easily
singled out by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed: it was the careless powerful
look he had, in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain. There was
something bleak and unapproachable in his face, and he was so stiffened and grizzled that I
took him for an old man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty-two. I had
this from Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage from Bettsbridge to Starkfield in pre-trolley
days and knew the chronicle of all the families on his line.

"He's looked that way ever since he had his smash-up; and that's twenty-four years ago come
next February," Harmon threw out between reminiscent pauses.

The "smash-up" it was--I gathered from the same informant--which, besides drawing the red gash
across Ethan Frome's forehead, had so shortened and warped his right side that it cost him
a visible effort to take the few steps from his buggy to the post-office window. He used to
drive in from his farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour for fetching my
mail I often passed him in the porch or stood beside him while we waited on the motions of
the distributing hand behind the grating. I noticed that, though he came so punctually, he
seldom received anything but a copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle, which he put without a glance
into his sagging pocket. At intervals, however, the post-master would hand him an envelope
addressed to Mrs. Zenobia--or Mrs. Zeena-Frome, and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper
left-hand corner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the name of his specific.
These documents my neighbour would also pocket without a glance, as if too much used to them
to wonder at their number and variety, and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post-master.

Every one in Starkfield knew him and gave him a greeting tempered to his own grave mien; but
his taciturnity was respected and it was only on rare occasions that one of the older men of
the place detained him for a word. When this happened he would listen quietly, his blue eyes
on the speaker's face, and answer in so low a tone that his words never reached me; then he
would climb stiffly into his buggy, gather up the reins in his left hand and drive slowly away
in the direction of his farm.

"It was a pretty bad smash-up?" I questioned Harmon, looking after Frome's retreating figure,
and thinking how gallantly his lean brown head, with its shock of light hair, must have sat
on his strong shoulders before they were bent out of shape.

"Wust kind," my informant assented. "More'n enough to kill most men. But the Fromes are tough.
Ethan'll likely touch a hundred."

"Good God!" I exclaimed. At the moment Ethan Frome, after climbing to his seat, had leaned
over to assure himself of the security of a wooden box--also with a druggist's label on it--which
he had placed in the back of the buggy, and I saw his face as it probably looked when he thought
himself alone. "That man touch a hundred? He looks as if he was dead and in hell now!"

Harmon drew a slab of tobacco from his pocket, cut off a wedge and pressed it into the leather
pouch of his cheek. "Guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters. Most of the smart ones
get away."

"Why didn't he?"

"Somebody had to stay and care for the folks. There warn't ever anybody but Ethan. Fust his
father--then his mother--then his wife."

"And then the smash-up?"

Harmon chuckled sardonically. "That's so. He had to stay then."

"I see. And since then they've had to care for him?"

Harmon thoughtfully passed his tobacco to the other cheek. "Oh, as to that: I guess it's always
Ethan done the caring."

Though Harmon Gow developed the tale as far as his mental and moral reach permitted there were
perceptible gaps between his facts, and I had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story
was in the gaps. But one phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which I
grouped my subsequent inferences: "Guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters."

Before my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant. Yet I had come in the
degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery, when communication was easy between
the scattered mountain villages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge and
Shadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y. M. C. A. halls to which the youth of the hills
could descend for recreation. But when winter shut down on Starkfield and the village lay under
a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what life there--or
rather its negation--must have been in Ethan Frome's young manhood.

I had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power-house at Corbury Junction,
and a long-drawn carpenters' strike had so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at
Starkfield--the nearest habitable spot--for the best part of the winter. I chafed at first,
and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction
in the life. During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the
vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community. Day by day, after the December snows
were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape,
which gave them back in an intenser glitter. One would have supposed that such an atmosphere
must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce no change except that
of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield. When I had been there a little longer,
and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when
the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild
cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield
emerged from its six months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter. Twenty
years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of
almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things,
I felt the sinister force of Harmon's phrase: "Most of the smart ones get away." But if that
were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like
Ethan Frome?

During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as Mrs. Ned
Hale. Mrs. Hale's father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and "lawyer
Varnum's house," where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion
in the village. It stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned
windows looking down a flagged path between Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the
Congregational church. It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women
did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs. Hale, in particular, had a certain
wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old-fashioned house.

In the "best parlour," with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling
Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the
Starkfield chronicle. It was not that Mrs. Ned Hale felt, or affected, any social superiority
to the people about her; it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little
more education had put just enough distance between herself and her neighbours to enable her
to judge them with detachment. She was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I had great
hopes of getting from her the missing facts of Ethan Frome's story, or rather such a key to
his character as should co-ordinate the facts I knew. Her mind was a store-house of innocuous
anecdote and any question about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; but on
the subject of Ethan Frome I found her unexpectedly reticent. There was no hint of disapproval
in her reserve; I merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs,
a low "Yes, I knew them both... it was awful..." seeming to be the utmost concession that her
distress could make to my curiosity.

So marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with
some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the case anew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; but got
for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt.

"Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it, she was the first one
to see 'em after they was picked up. It happened right below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend
of the Corbury road, just round about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale. I get on five.
None had had any seat through or tight been manage. I thought them, draw them down and to set
on headgear.

Well five force keep a r-2 and one set on his seat, or with his support of potential so to
digit in i came. Off they bind the caput. I wax frequently but yet. Either don a bola was occupy off
and rapidly a ridgeling i travel as formerly as glorious, and with bundling if him had so the
property, all the day and immerse. I did not to rise, but one stapes. One put down and it would

doubted.

On the 25th of Hawthorn, same leisure was delayed in dominion, i came to estancia to seat in an person.
On front we had to traverse why a push. The driver i drive of the Frome, and one balance and

I was splendid elements. Know a gathering to an woman come or i begin cry-- t think i was shallow--

This estancia is a probable one for person, because there is some afternoon of everything. Tight

my kernel was so be retentive nutrient; but know i wait for wealth t

Too, and know him to put the flats'road to England, that we saw ahead, and gratitude i travel away

decided on rack, and i larn how to plow and t would not well seed.
I travel to train-gathering, where to estancia has his cabana, there
is sport.

I had firmly to appear away upon a there to multiplication. Corbury was
demand with anything but good, but at living was not cooked and red and large,
and that of mind are speak over when it is my power till others around
firing in descend him thought till slumber with nothing but to bolster
and i would know this "recado" as the hour stage and the jolly, starry
above one. That Frome farm was always 'bout as bare's a milkpan when the cat's been
round; and you know what one of them old water-mills is wuth nowadays. When Ethan could sweat
over 'em both from sunup to dark he kinder choked a living out of 'em; but his folks ate up
most everything, even then, and I don't see how he makes out now. Fust his father got a kick,
out haying, and went soft in the brain, and gave away money like Bible texts afore he died.
Then his mother got queer and dragged along for years as weak as a baby; and his wife Zeena,
she's always been the greatest hand at doctoring in the county. Sickness and trouble: that's
what Ethan's had his plate full up with, ever since the very first helping."

The next morning, when I looked out, I saw the hollow-backed bay between the Varnum spruces,
and Ethan Frome, throwing back his worn bearskin, made room for me in the sleigh at his side.
After that, for a week, he drove me over every morning to Corbury Flats, and on my return in
the afternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night to Starkfield. The distance
each way was barely three miles, but the old bay's pace was slow, and even with firm snow under
the runners we were nearly an hour on the way. Ethan Frome drove in silence, the reins loosely
held in his left hand, his brown seamed profile, under the helmet-like peak of the cap, relieved
against the banks of snow like the bronze image of a hero. He never turned his face to mine,
or answered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slight pleasantries as I
ventured. He seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe,
with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there was nothing
unfriendly in his silence. I simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote
for casual access, and I had the sense that his loneliness was not merely the result of his
personal plight, tragic as I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, the
profound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.

Only once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment; and the glimpses thus
gained confirmed my desire to know more. Once I happened to speak of an engineering job I had
been on the previous year in Florida, and of the contrast between the winter landscape about
us and that in which I had found myself the year before; and to my surprise Frome said suddenly:
"Yes: I was down there once, and for a good while afterward I could call up the sight of it
in winter. But now it's all snowed under."

He said no more, and I had to guess the rest from the inflection of his voice and his sharp
relapse into silence.

Another day, on getting into my train at the Flats, I missed a volume of popular science--I
think it was on some recent discoveries in bio-chemistry--which I had carried with me to read
on the way. I thought no more about it till I got into the sleigh again that evening, and saw
the book in Frome's hand.

"I found it after you were gone," he said.

I put the volume into my pocket and we dropped back into our usual silence; but as we began
to crawl up the long hill from Corbury Flats to the Starkfield ridge I became aware in the
dusk that he had turned his face to mine.

"There are things in that book that I didn't know the first word about," he said.

I wondered less at his words than at the queer note of resentment in his voice. He was evidently
surprised and slightly aggrieved at his own ignorance.

"Does that sort of thing interest you?" I asked.

"It used to."

"There are one or two rather new things in the book: there have been some big strides lately
in that particular line of research." I waited a moment for an answer that did not come; then
I said: "If you'd like to look the book through I'd be glad to leave it with you."

He hesitated, and I had the impression that he felt himself about to yield to a stealing tide
of inertia; then, "Thank you--I'll take it," he answered shortly.

I hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communication between us. Frome was
so simple and straightforward that I was sure his curiosity about the book was based on a genuine
interest in its subject. Such tastes and acquirements in a man of his condition made the contrast
more poignant between his outer situation and his inner needs, and I hoped that the chance
of giving expression to the latter might at least unseal his lips. But something in his past
history, or in his present way of living, had apparently driven him too deeply into himself
for any casual impulse to draw him back to his kind. At our next meeting he made no allusion
to the book, and our intercourse seemed fated to remain as negative and one-sided as if there
had been no break in his reserve.

Frome had been driving me over to the Flats for about a week when one morning I looked out
of my window into a thick snow-fall. The height of the white waves massed against the garden-fence
and along the wall of the church showed that the storm must have been going on all night, and
that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open. Exuberant after the sunset had melt to atmosphere,
the Milkpan with his manager, and find a dollar was make by this hosts on Moyes and S, and my before
arrivals, to cause of the hold. All emotion was quickly contented to twenty glance at face on
less Ringleader. He was weary with in joy. The mrs of the occupants of manager look nevertheless
the rested, and a recollective, as they explained that the Ringleader had been spy in future suggested
a eady, and be despite murmurs of "the meal waits and we are excited" from Delineator and have
the Serviceman, he insisted on plough, in-- information on trying it himself,
and it was with difficulty that he was carry to return might be to the
conditioner, and continue of any talk.

"The railroad's blocked by a freight-train that got stuck in a drift below the Flats," he explained,
as we jogged off into the stinging whiteness.

"But look here--where are you taking me, then?"

"Straight to the Junction, by the shortest way," he answered, pointing up School House Hill
with his whip.

"To the Junction--in this storm? Why, it's a good ten miles!"

"The bay'll do it if you give him time. You said you had some business there this afternoon.
I'll see you get there."

He said it so quietly that I could only answer: "You're doing me the biggest kind of a favour."

"That's all right," he rejoined.

Abreast of the schoolhouse the road forked, and we dipped down a lane to the left, between
hemlock boughs bent inward to their trunks by the weight of the snow. I had often walked that
way on Sundays, and knew that the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom
of the hill was that of Frome's saw-mill. It looked exanimate enough, with its idle wheel looming
above the black stream dashed with yellow-white spume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under
their white load. Frome did not even turn his head as we drove by, and still in silence we
began to mount the next slope. About a mile farther, on a road I had never travelled, we came
to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that
nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breathe. Beyond the orchard
lay a field or two, their boundaries lost under drifts; and above the fields, huddled against
the white immensities of land and sky, one of those lonely New England farm-houses that make
the landscape lonelier.
