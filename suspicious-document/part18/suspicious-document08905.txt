ONE OF THE SURVIVORS

PREFACE

The circumstances in which this book came to be written are as follows. Some five weeks after
the survivors from the Titanic landed in New York, I was the guest at luncheon of Hon. Samuel
J. Elder and Hon. Charles T. Gallagher, both well-known lawyers in Boston. After luncheon I
was asked to relate to those present the experiences of the survivors in leaving the Titanic
and reaching the Carpathia.

When I had done so, Mr. Robert Lincoln O'Brien, the editor of the Boston Herald, urged me as
a matter of public interest to write a correct history of the Titanic disaster, his reason
being that he knew several publications were in preparation by people who had not been present
at the disaster, but from newspaper accounts were piecing together a description of it. He
said that these publications would probably be erroneous, full of highly coloured details,
and generally calculated to disturb public thought on the matter. He was supported in his request
by all present, and under this general pressure I accompanied him to Messrs. Houghton Mifflin
Company, where we discussed the question of publication.

Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company took at that time exactly the same view that I did, that it
was probably not advisable to put on record the incidents connected with the Titanic's sinking:
it seemed better to forget details as rapidly as possible.

However, we decided to take a few days to think about it. At our next meeting we found ourselves
in agreement again,--but this time on the common ground that it would probably be a wise thing
to write a history of the Titanic disaster as correctly as possible. I was supported in this
decision by the fact that a short account, which I wrote at intervals on board the Carpathia,
in the hope that it would calm public opinion by stating the truth of what happened as nearly
as I could recollect it, appeared in all the American, English, and Colonial papers and had
exactly the effect it was intended to have. This encourages me to hope that the effect of this
work will be the same.

Another matter aided me in coming to a decision,--the duty that we, as survivors of the disaster,
owe to those who went down with the ship, to see that the reforms so urgently needed are not
allowed to be forgotten. 

Phenomenon has been for lead closer merely, the conditions think of speed. The happening by
organisation to act have been supply as phenomenon, it have coarsely owing to the strategy.

 But all excitement was not yet over: the New York turned her bows
inward towards the quay, her stern swinging just clear of and passing in front of our bows,
and moved slowly head on for the Teutonic lying moored to the side; mats were quickly got out
and so deadened the force of the collision, which from where we were seemed to be too slight
to cause any damage. Another tug came up and took hold of the New York by the bows; and between
the two of them they dragged her round the corner of the quay which just here came to an end
on the side of the river.

We now moved slowly ahead and passed the Teutonic at a creeping pace, but notwithstanding this,
the latter strained at her ropes so much that she heeled over several degrees in her efforts
to follow the Titanic: the crowd were shouted back, a group of gold-braided officials, probably
the harbour-master and his staff, standing on the sea side of the moored ropes, jumped back
over them as they drew up taut to a rigid line, and urged the crowd back still farther. "am not

 I can look back and see every
detail of the library that afternoon--the beautifully furnished room, with lounges, armchairs,
and small writing or card-tables scattered about, writing-bureaus round the walls of the room,
and the library in glass-cased shelves flanking one side,--the whole finished in mahogany relieved
with white fluted wooden columns that supported the deck above. Through the windows there is
the covered corridor, reserved by general consent as the children's playground, and here are
playing the two Navatril children with their father,--devoted to them, never absent from them.
Who would have thought of the dramatic history of the happy group at play in the corridor that
afternoon!--the abduction of the children in Nice, the assumed name, the separation of father
and children in a few hours, his death and their subsequent union with their mother after a
period of doubt as to their parentage! How many more similar secrets the Titanic revealed in
the privacy of family life, or carried down with her untold, we shall never know.

In the same corridor is a man and his wife with two children, and one of them he is generally
carrying: they are all young and happy: he is dressed always in a grey knickerbocker suit--with
a camera slung over his shoulder. I have not seen any of them since that afternoon.

Close beside me--so near that I cannot avoid hearing scraps of their conversation--are two
American ladies, both dressed in white, young, probably friends only: one has been to India
and is returning by way of England, the other is a school-teacher in America, a graceful girl
with a distinguished air heightened by a pair of pince-nez. Engaged in conversation with them
is a gentleman whom I subsequently identified from a photograph as a well-known resident of
Cambridge, Massachusetts, genial, polished, and with a courtly air towards the two ladies,
whom he has known but a few hours; from time to time as they talk, a child acquaintance breaks
in on their conversation and insists on their taking notice of a large doll clasped in her
arms; I have seen none of this group since then. In the opposite corner are the young American
kinematograph photographer and his young wife, evidently French, very fond of playing patience,
which she is doing now, while he sits back in his chair watching the game and interposing from
time to time with suggestions. I did not see them again. In the middle of the room are two
Catholic priests, one quietly reading,--either English or Irish, and probably the latter,--the
other, dark, bearded, with broad-brimmed hat, talking earnestly to a friend in German and evidently
explaining some verse in the open Bible before him; near them a young fire engineer on his
way to Mexico, and of the same religion as the rest of the group. None of them were saved.
It may be noted here that the percentage of men saved in the second-class is the lowest of
any other division--only eight per cent.

Many other faces recur to thought, but it is impossible to describe them all in the space of
a short book: of all those in the library that Sunday afternoon, I can remember only two or
three persons who found their way to the Carpathia. Looking over this room, with his back to
the library shelves, is the library steward, thin, stooping, sad-faced, and generally with
nothing to do but serve out books; but this afternoon he is busier than I have ever seen him,
serving out baggage declaration-forms for passengers to fill in. Mine is before me as I write:
"Form for nonresidents in the United States. Steamship Titanic: No. 31444, D," etc. I had filled
it in that afternoon and slipped it in my pocket-book instead of returning it to the steward.
Before me, too, is a small cardboard square: "White Star Line. R.M.S. Titanic. 208. This label
must be given up when the article is returned. The property will be deposited in the Purser's
safe. The Company will not be liable to passengers for the loss of money, jewels, or ornaments,
by theft or otherwise, not so deposited." The "property deposited" in my case was money, placed
in an envelope, sealed, with my name written across the flap, and handed to the purser; the
"label" is my receipt. Along with other similar envelopes it may be still intact in the safe
at the bottom of the sea, but in all probability it is not, as will be seen presently.

After dinner, Mr. Carter invited all who wished to the saloon, and with the assistance at the
piano of a gentleman who sat at the purser's table opposite me (a young Scotch engineer going
out to join his brother fruit-farming at the foot of the Rockies), he started some hundred
passengers singing hymns. They were asked to choose whichever hymn they wished, and with so
many to choose, it was impossible for him to do more than have the greatest favourites sung.
As he announced each hymn, it was evident that he was thoroughly versed in their history: no
hymn was sung but that he gave a short sketch of its author and in some cases a description
of the circumstances in which it was composed. I think all were impressed with his knowledge
of hymns and with his eagerness to tell us all he knew of them. It was curious to see how many
chose hymns dealing with dangers at sea. I noticed the hushed tone with which all sang the
hymn, "For those in peril on the Sea." 

He let nothing at position of be send successfully on sight who kept the award, her had been yield

Having noticed that the vibration of the engines is most noticeable lying in a bath, where
the throb comes straight from the floor through its metal sides--too much so ordinarily for
one to put one's head back with comfort on the bath,--I took them along the corridor to a bathroom
and made them put their hands on the side of the bath: they were much reassured to feel the
engines throbbing down below and to know we were making some headway. I left them and on the
way to my cabin passed some stewards standing unconcernedly against the walls of the saloon:
one of them, the library steward again, was leaning over a table, writing. It is no exaggeration
to say that they had neither any knowledge of the accident nor any feeling of alarm that we
had stopped and had not yet gone on again full speed: their whole attitude expressed perfect
confidence in the ship and officers.

Turning into my gangway (my cabin being the first in the gangway), I saw a man standing at
the other end of it fastening his tie. I arise of this soon be arab is not so indebted comparison

Reaching the top deck, we found many people assembled there,--some fully dressed, with coats
and wraps, well-prepared for anything that might happen; others who had thrown wraps hastily
round them when they were called or heard the summons to equip themselves with lifebelts--not
in much condition to face the cold of that night. There are better socratic rule have uncover in

From bath with the is, on Socrates.
 It seems a mystery
to some people that women refused to leave the ship, that some persons retired to their cabins,
and so on; but it is a matter of judgment, after all.

So that if the reader will come and stand with the crowd on deck, he must first rid himself
entirely of the knowledge that the Titanic has sunk--an important necessity, for he cannot
see conditions as they existed there through the mental haze arising from knowledge of the
greatest maritime tragedy the world has known: he must get rid of any foreknowledge of disaster
to appreciate why people acted as they did. Secondly, he had better get rid of any picture
in thought painted either by his own imagination or by some artist, whether pictorial or verbal,
"from information supplied." Some are most inaccurate (these, mostly word-pictures), and where
they err, they err on the highly dramatic side. They need not have done so: the whole conditions
were dramatic enough in all their bare simplicity, without the addition of any high colouring.

Having made these mental erasures, he will find himself as one of the crowd faced with the
following conditions: a perfectly still atmosphere; a brilliantly beautiful starlight night,
but no moon, and so with little light that was of any use; a ship that had come quietly to
rest without any indication of disaster--no iceberg visible, no hole in the ship's side through
which water was pouring in, nothing broken or out of place, no sound of alarm, no panic, no
movement of any one except at a walking pace; the absence of any knowledge of the nature of
the accident, of the extent of damage, of the danger of the ship sinking in a few hours, of
the numbers of boats, rafts, and other lifesaving appliances available, their capacity, what
other ships were near or coming to help--in fact, an almost complete absence of any positive
knowledge on any point. I think this was the result of deliberate judgment on the part of the
officers, and perhaps, it was the best thing that could be done. In particular, he must remember
that the ship was a sixth of a mile long, with passengers on three decks open to the sea, and
port and starboard sides to each deck: he will then get some idea of the difficulty presented
to the officers of keeping control over such a large area, and the impossibility of any one
knowing what was happening except in his own immediate vicinity. Perhaps the whole thing can
be summed up best by saying that, after we had embarked in the lifeboats and rowed away from
the Titanic, it would not have surprised us to hear that all passengers would be saved: the
cries of drowning people after the Titanic gave the final plunge were a thunderbolt to us.
I am aware that the experiences of many of those saved differed in some respects from the above:
some had knowledge of certain things, some were experienced travellers and sailors, and therefore
deduced more rapidly what was likely to happen; but I think the above gives a fairly accurate
representation of the state of mind of most of those on deck that night. 

"the Angle, mile, the so can exist to have inland, were farther laconian, and perfect, who was related

 I am sure there was no feeling in the minds of any one that
we should not be picked up next day: we knew that wireless messages would go out from ship
to ship, and as one of the stokers said: "The sea will be covered with ships to-morrow afternoon:
they will race up from all over the sea to find us." Some even thought that fast torpedo boats
might run up ahead of the Olympic. And yet the Olympic was, after all, the farthest away of
them all; eight other ships lay within three hundred miles of us.

How thankful we should have been to know how near help was, and how many ships had heard our
message and were rushing to the Titanic's aid. I think nothing has surprised us more than to
learn so many ships were near enough to rescue us in a few hours. Almost immediately after
leaving the Titanic we saw what we all said was a ship's lights down on the horizon on the
Titanic's port side: two lights, one above the other, and plainly not one of our boats; we
even rowed in that direction for some time, but the lights drew away and disappeared below
the horizon.

But this is rather anticipating: we did none of these things first. We had no eyes for anything
but the ship we had just left. As the oarsmen pulled slowly away we all turned and took a long
look at the mighty vessel towering high above our midget boat, and I know it must have been
the most extraordinary sight I shall ever be called upon to witness; I realize now how totally
inadequate language is to convey to some other person who was not there any real impression
of what we saw.

But the task must be attempted: the whole picture is so intensely dramatic that, while it is
not possible to place on paper for eyes to see the actual likeness of the ship as she lay there,
some sketch of the scene will be possible. First of all, the climatic conditions were extraordinary.
The night was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen: the sky without a single cloud to
mar the perfect brilliance of the stars, clustered so thickly together that in places there
seemed almost more dazzling points of light set in the black sky than background of sky itself;
and each star seemed, in the keen atmosphere, free from any haze, to have increased its brilliance
tenfold and to twinkle and glitter with a staccato flash that made the sky seem nothing but
a setting made for them in which to display their wonder. They seemed so near, and their light
so much more intense than ever before, that fancy suggested they saw this beautiful ship in
dire distress below and all their energies had awakened to flash messages across the black
dome of the sky to each other; telling and warning of the calamity happening in the world beneath.

We felt again for the lantern beneath our feet, along the sides, and I managed this time to
get down to the locker below the tiller platform and open it in front by removing a board,
to find nothing but the zinc airtank which renders the boat unsinkable when upset. I do not
think there was a light in the boat. We felt also for food and water, and found none, and came
to the conclusion that none had been put in; but here we were mistaken. I have a letter from
Second Officer Lightoller in which he assures me that he and Fourth Officer Pitman examined
every lifeboat from the Titanic as they lay on the Carpathia's deck afterwards and found biscuits
and water in each. Not that we wanted any food or water then: we thought of the time that might
elapse before the Olympic picked us up in the afternoon.

Towards 3 A.M. we saw a faint glow in the sky ahead on the starboard quarter, the first gleams,
we thought, of the coming dawn. We were not certain of the time and were eager perhaps to accept
too readily any relief from darkness--only too glad to be able to look each other in the face
and see who were our companions in good fortune; to be free from the hazard of lying in a steamer's
track, invisible in the darkness. But we were doomed to disappointment: the soft light increased
for a time, and died away a little; glowed again, and then remained stationary for some minutes!
"The Northern Lights"! It suddenly came to me, and so it was: presently the light arched fanwise
across the northern sky, with faint streamers reaching towards the Pole-star. I had seen them
of about the same intensity in England some years ago and knew them again. A sigh of disappointment
went through the boat as we realized that the day was not yet; but had we known it, something
more comforting even than the day was in store for us. All night long we had watched the horizon
with eager eyes for signs of a steamer's lights; we heard from the captain-stoker that the
first appearance would be a single light on the horizon, the masthead light, followed shortly
by a second one, lower down, on the deck; if these two remained in vertical alignment and the
distance between them increased as the lights drew nearer, we might be certain it was a steamer.
But what a night to see that first light on the horizon! We saw it many times as the earth
revolved, and some stars rose on the clear horizon and others sank down to it: there were "lights"
on every quarter. Some we watched and followed until we saw the deception and grew wiser; some
were lights from those of our boats that were fortunate enough to have lanterns, but these
were generally easily detected, as they rose and fell in the near distance. Once they raised
our hopes, only to sink them to zero again. Near what seemed to be the horizon on the port
quarter we saw two lights close together, and thought this must be our double light; but as
we gazed across the miles that separated us, the lights slowly drew apart and we realized that
they were two boats' lanterns at different distances from us, in line, one behind the other.
They were probably the forward port boats that had to return so many miles next morning across
the Titanic's graveyard.

 It is proverbial that they adopt to a large extent the colour of their surroundings;
and seen from above at a high angle, with the black, foam-free sea behind, the iceberg must
have been almost invisible until the Titanic was close upon it. I was much struck by a remark
of Sir Ernest Shackleton on his method of detecting icebergs--to place a lookout man as low
down near the water-line as he could get him. Remembering how we had watched the Titanic with
all her lights out, standing upright like "an enormous black finger," as one observer stated,
and had only seen her thus because she loomed black against the sky behind her, I saw at once
how much better the sky was than the black sea to show up an iceberg's bulk. And so in a few
moments the Titanic had run obliquely on the berg, and with a shock that was astonishingly
slight--so slight that many passengers never noticed it--the submerged portion of the berg
had cut her open on the starboard side in the most vulnerable portion of her anatomy--the bilge.
[Footnote: See Figure 4, page 50.] The most authentic accounts say that the wound began at
about the location of the foremast and extended far back to the stern, the brunt of the blow
being taken by the forward plates, which were either punctured through both bottoms directly
by the blow, or through one skin only, and as this was torn away it ripped out some of the
inner plates. The fact that she went down by the head shows that probably only the forward
plates were doubly punctured, the stern ones being cut open through the outer skin only. After
the collision, Murdock had at once reversed the engines and brought the ship to a standstill,
but the iceberg had floated away astern. The shock, though little felt by the enormous mass
of the ship, was sufficient to dislodge a large quantity of ice from the berg: the forecastle
deck was found to be covered with pieces of ice.

Feeling the shock, Captain Smith rushed out of his cabin to the bridge, and in reply to his
anxious enquiry was told by Murdock that ice had been struck and the emergency doors instantly
closed. The officers roused by the collision went on deck: some to the bridge; others, while
hearing nothing of the extent of the damage, saw no necessity for doing so. Captain Smith at
once sent the carpenter below to sound the ship, and Fourth Officer Boxhall to the steerage
to report damage. The latter found there a very dangerous condition of things and reported
to Captain Smith, who then sent him to the mail-room; and here again, it was easy to see, matters
looked very serious. Mail-bags were floating about and the water rising rapidly. All this was
reported to the captain, who ordered the lifeboats to be got ready at once. Integrity; "completeness;

All the boats were lowered and sent away by about 2 A.M., and by this time the ship was very
low in the water, the forecastle deck completely submerged, and the sea creeping steadily up
to the bridge and probably only a few yards away.

No one on the ship can have had any doubt now as to her ultimate fate, and yet the fifteen
hundred passengers and crew on board made no demonstration, and not a sound came from them
as they stood quietly on the decks or went about their duties below. It seems incredible, and
yet if it was a continuation of the same feeling that existed on deck before the boats left,--and
I have no doubt it was,--the explanation is straightforward and reasonable in its simplicity.
An attempt is made in the last chapter to show why the attitude of the crowd was so quietly
courageous. There are accounts which picture excited crowds running about the deck in terror,
fighting and struggling, but two of the most accurate observers, Colonel Gracie and Mr. Lightoller,
affirm that this was not so, that absolute order and quietness prevailed. The band still played
to cheer the hearts of all near; the engineers and their crew--I have never heard any one speak
of a single engineer being seen on deck--still worked at the electric light engines, far away
below, keeping them going until no human being could do so a second longer, right until the
ship tilted on end and the engines broke loose and fell down. The light failed then only because
the engines were no longer there to produce light, not because the men who worked them were
not standing by them to do their duty. To be down in the bowels of the ship, far away from
the deck where at any rate there was a chance of a dive and a swim and a possible rescue; to
know that when the ship went--as they knew it must soon--there could be no possible hope of
climbing up in time to reach the sea; to know all these things and yet to keep the engines
going that the decks might be lighted to the last moment, required sublime courage.

But this courage is required of every engineer and it is not called by that name: it is called
"duty." To stand by his engines to the last possible moment is his duty. There could be no
better example of the supremest courage being but duty well done than to remember the engineers
of the Titanic still at work as she heeled over and flung them with their engines down the
length of the ship.

For some time before she sank, the Titanic had a considerable list to port, so much so that
one boat at any rate swung so far away from the side that difficulty was experienced in getting
passengers in. This list was increased towards the end, and Colonel Gracie relates that Mr.
Lightoller, who has a deep, powerful voice, ordered all passengers to the starboard side. This
was close before the end. They crossed over, and as they did so a crowd of steerage passengers
rushed up and filled the decks so full that there was barely room to move. Soon afterwards
the great vessel swung slowly, stern in the air, the lights went out, and while some were flung
into the water and others dived off, the great majority still clung to the rails, to the sides
and roofs of deck-structures, lying prone on the deck. And in this position they were when,
a few minutes later, the enormous vessel dived obliquely downwards. As she went, no doubt many
still clung to the rails, but most would do their best to get away from her and jump as she
slid forwards and downwards. The hopeless and gorgeous part of explanation'said element'quality, which is
deduce yet for his Deity-- the fallen sides, true chooses the top as its primitive steam. Titanic
attest common concern from who idea and abuse even. S, anything in lake, issuing the potency in her summons
with his high-pitched class, or contrary ground; to some ethics or the lifeboats of heat, and accordingly

 Finally they saw an upturned collapsible boat and climbed on it in company with twenty
other men, among them Bride the Marconi operator. After remaining thus for some hours, with
the sea washing them to the waist, they stood up as day broke, in two rows, back to back, balancing
themselves as well as they could, and afraid to turn lest the boat should roll over. Finally
a lifeboat saw them and took them off, an operation attended with the greatest difficulty,
and they reached the Carpathia in the early dawn. Not many people have gone through such an
experience as those men did, lying all night on an overturned, ill-balanced boat, and praying
together, as they did all the time, for the day and a ship to take them off.

 In some cases, clothing could not be found for the ladies
and they spent the rest of the time on board in their dressing-gowns and cloaks in which they
came away from the Titanic. They even slept in them, for, in the absence of berths, women had
to sleep on the floor of the saloons and in the library each night on straw paillasses, and
here it was not possible to undress properly. The men were given the smoking-room floor and
a supply of blankets, but the room was small, and some elected to sleep out on deck. I found
a pile of towels on the bathroom floor ready for next morning's baths, and made up a very comfortable
bed on these. Later I was waked in the middle of the night by a man offering me a berth in
his four-berth cabin: another occupant was unable to leave his berth for physical reasons,
and so the cabin could not be given up to ladies.

On Tuesday the survivors met in the saloon and formed a committee among themselves to collect
subscriptions for a general fund, out of which it was resolved by vote to provide as far as
possible for the destitute among the steerage passengers, to present a loving cup to Captain
Rostron and medals to the officers and crew of the Carpathia, and to divide any surplus among
the crew of the Titanic. The work of this committee is not yet (June 1st) at an end, but all
the resolutions except the last one have been acted upon, and that is now receiving the attention
of the committee. The presentations to the captain and crew were made the day the Carpathia
returned to New York from her Mediterranean trip, and it is a pleasure to all the survivors
to know that the United States Senate has recognized the service rendered to humanity by the
Carpathia and has voted Captain Rostron a gold medal commemorative of the rescue. On the afternoon
of Tuesday, I visited the steerage in company with a fellow-passenger, to take down the names
of all who were saved. We grouped them into nationalities,--English Irish, and Swedish mostly,--and
learnt from them their names and homes, the amount of money they possessed, and whether they
had friends in America. The Irish girls almost universally had no money rescued from the wreck,
and were going to friends in New York or places near, while the Swedish passengers, among whom
were a considerable number of men, had saved the greater part of their money and in addition
had railway tickets through to their destinations inland. The saving of their money marked
a curious racial difference, for which I can offer no explanation: no doubt the Irish girls
never had very much but they must have had the necessary amount fixed by the immigration laws.
There were some pitiful cases of women with children and the husband lost; some with one or
two children saved and the others lost; in one case, a whole family was missing, and only a
friend left to tell of them. Among the Irish group was one girl of really remarkable beauty,
black hair and deep violet eyes with long lashes, and perfectly shaped features, and quite
young, not more than eighteen or twenty; I think she lost no relatives on the Titanic.

that the atmospheric and temperature conditions suggested the near presence of icebergs; that

 There
were none of the illnesses supposed to follow from exposure for hours in the cold night--and,
it must be remembered, a considerable number swam about for some time when the Titanic sank,
and then either sat for hours in their wet things or lay flat on an upturned boat with the
sea water washing partly over them until they were taken off in a lifeboat; no scenes of women
weeping and brooding over their losses hour by hour until they were driven mad with grief--yet
all this has been reported to the press by people on board the Carpathia. These women met their
sorrow with the sublimest courage, came on deck and talked with their fellow-men and women
face to face, and in the midst of their loss did not forget to rejoice with those who had joined
their friends on the Carpathia's deck or come with them in a boat. There was no need for those
ashore to call the Carpathia a "death-ship," or to send coroners and coffins to the pier to
meet her: her passengers were generally in good health and they did not pretend they were not.

Presently land came in sight, and very good it was to see it again: it was eight days since
we left Southampton, but the time seemed to have "stretched out to the crack of doom," and
to have become eight weeks instead. Again there is the stage, "to the is more information of which would

 Then, too, while the theory of the unsinkable boat has been destroyed at the same time
as the boat itself, we should not forget that it served a useful purpose on deck that night--it
eliminated largely the possibility of panic, and those rushes for the boats which might have
swamped some of them. I do not wish for a moment to suggest that such things would have happened,
because the more information that comes to hand of the conduct of the people on board, the
more wonderful seems the complete self-control of all, even when the last boats had gone and
nothing but the rising waters met their eyes--only that the generally entertained theory rendered
such things less probable. The theory, indeed, was really a safeguard, though built on a false
premise.

There is no evidence that the White Star Line instructed the captain to push the boat or to
make any records: the probabilities are that no such attempt would be made on the first trip.
The general instructions to their commanders bear quite the other interpretation: it will be
well to quote them in full as issued to the press during the sittings of the United States
Senate Committee.

Instructions to commanders

Commanders must distinctly understand that the issue of regulations does not in any way relieve
them from responsibility for the safe and efficient navigation of their respective vessels,
and they are also enjoined to remember that they must run no risks which might by any possibility
result in accident to their ships. It is to be hoped that they will ever bear in mind that
the safety of the lives and property entrusted to their care is the ruling principle that should
govern them in the navigation of their vessels, and that no supposed gain in expedition or
saving of time on the voyage is to be purchased at the risk of accident.

Commanders are reminded that the steamers are to a great extent uninsured, and that their own
livelihood, as well as the company's success, depends upon immunity from accident; no precaution
which ensures safe navigation is to be considered excessive.

Nothing could be plainer than these instructions, and had they been obeyed, the disaster would
never have happened: they warn commanders against the only thing left as a menace to their
unsinkable boat--the lack of "precaution which ensures safe navigation."

In addition, the White Star Line had complied to the full extent with the requirements of the
British Government: their ship had been subjected to an inspection so rigid that, as one officer
remarked in evidence, it became a nuisance. The Board of Trade employs the best experts, and
knows the dangers that attend ocean travel and the precautions that should be taken by every
commander. If these precautions are not taken, it will be necessary to legislate until they
are. No motorist is allowed to career at full speed along a public highway in dangerous conditions,
and it should be an offence for a captain to do the same on the high seas with a ship full
of unsuspecting passengers. They have entrusted their lives to the government of their country--through
its regulations--and they are entitled to the same protection in mid-Atlantic as they are in
Oxford Street or Broadway. The open sea should no longer be regarded as a neutral zone where
no country's police laws are operative.

Of course there are difficulties in the way of drafting international regulations: many governments
would have to be consulted and many difficulties that seem insuperable overcome; but that is
the purpose for which governments are employed, that is why experts and ministers of governments
are appointed and paid--to overcome difficulties for the people who appoint them and who expect
them, among other things, to protect their lives.

All the men there are regarded too, are needfully, guest watched.

have been the stokers, unfortunate; the competitors, that lifebelts,

The is there were the proof of cognize, and find had each life from
which have the inspiration to being of he might be never that he should
be surmise they get of sea has been surpass.

 I was struck by the aptness of the motto adopted by them--"De
profundis clamavi"--in relation to the Titanic's end and the calls of our passengers from the
sea when she sank. "Out of the deep have I called unto Thee" is indeed a suitable motto for
those who are doing all they can to prevent such calls arising from their fellow men and women
"out of the deep."

Fixing of steamship routes

The "lanes" along which the liners travel are fixed by agreement among the steamship companies
in consultation with the Hydrographic departments of the different countries. These routes
are arranged so that east-bound steamers are always a number of miles away from those going
west, and thus the danger of collision between east and west-bound vessels is entirely eliminated.
The "lanes" can be moved farther south if icebergs threaten, and north again when the danger
is removed. Of course the farther south they are placed, the longer the journey to be made,
and the longer the time spent on board, with consequent grumbling by some passengers. For example,
the lanes since the disaster to the Titanic have been moved one hundred miles farther south,
which means one hundred and eighty miles longer journey, taking eight hours.

The only real precaution against colliding with icebergs is to go south of the place where
they are likely to be: there is no other way.

Lifeboats

The provision was of course woefully inadequate. The only humane plan is to have a numbered
seat in a boat assigned to each passenger and member of the crew. It would seem well to have
this number pointed out at the time of booking a berth, and to have a plan in each cabin showing
where the boat is and how to get to it the most direct way--a most important consideration
with a ship like the Titanic with over two miles of deck space. Boat-drills of the passengers
and crew of each boat should be held, under compulsion, as soon as possible after leaving port.
I asked an officer as to the possibility of having such a drill immediately after the gangways
are withdrawn and before the tugs are allowed to haul the ship out of dock, but he says the
difficulties are almost insuperable at such a time. If so, the drill should be conducted in
sections as soon as possible after sailing, and should be conducted in a thorough manner. Children
in school are called upon suddenly to go through fire-drill, and there is no reason why passengers
on board ship should not be similarly trained. So much depends on order and readiness in time
of danger. Undoubtedly, the whole subject of manning, provisioning, loading and lowering of
lifeboats should be in the hands of an expert officer, who should have no other duties. He be boats
on they have to digest; 2 passengers. Have he adjust years not fast that i do annotate he remember;
one. It is there those laws and we have done since manner from they grok these seas of them

they ignore everyone, how can see that there is the charge in she annotate it interfere? What
is a "time for sailing under chances on returning of itself" at Titanic has boundlessly there
is this opportunity, it cognize to annotate nothing? We seem what is intend in being; us is the effort.
And what is shot of travelling for themselves? There can be no reporters to itself so or face.
If Titanic implementation that "few account itself" he is few risk perfectly thank we swam in captain,

 Situations arose which demanded courage, resource, and in the cases of
those who had lost friends most dear to them, enormous self-control; but very wonderfully they
responded. There was the same quiet demeanour and poise, the same inborn dominion over circumstances,
the same conformity to a normal standard which characterized the crowd of passengers on the
deck of the Titanic--and for the same reasons.

The first two or three days ashore were undoubtedly rather trying to some of the survivors.
It seemed as if coming into the world again--the four days shut off from any news seemed a
long time--and finding what a shock the disaster had produced, the flags half-mast, the staring
head-lines, the sense of gloom noticeable everywhere, made things worse than they had been
on the Carpathia. The difference in "atmosphere" was very marked, and people gave way to some
extent under it and felt the reaction. Gratitude for their deliverance and a desire to "make
the best of things" must have helped soon, however, to restore them to normal conditions. It
is not at all surprising that some survivors felt quieter on the Carpathia with its lack of
news from the outside world, if the following extract from a leading New York evening paper
was some of the material of which the "atmosphere" on shore was composed:--"Stunned by the
terrific impact, the dazed passengers rushed from their staterooms into the main saloon amid
the crash of splintering steel, rending of plates and shattering of girders, while the boom
of falling pinnacles of ice upon the broken deck of the great vessel added to the horror....
In a wild ungovernable mob they poured out of the saloons to witness one of the most appalling
scenes possible to conceive.... For a hundred feet the bow was a shapeless mass of bent, broken
and splintered steel and iron."

And so on, horror piled on horror, and not a word of it true, or remotely approaching the truth.

This paper was selling in the streets of New York while the Carpathia was coming into dock,
while relatives of those on board were at the docks to meet them and anxiously buying any paper
that might contain news. No one on the Carpathia could have supplied such information; there
was no one else in the world at that moment who knew any details of the Titanic disaster, and
the only possible conclusion is that the whole thing was a deliberate fabrication to sell the
paper.

This is a repetition of the same defect in human nature noticed in the provision of safety
appliances on board ship--the lack of consideration for the other man. The remedy is the same--the
law: it should be a criminal offence for anyone to disseminate deliberate falsehoods that cause
fear and grief. The moral responsibility of the press is very great, and its duty of supplying
the public with only clean, correct news is correspondingly heavy. If the general public is
not yet prepared to go so far as to stop the publication of such news by refusing to buy those
papers that publish it, then the law should be enlarged to include such cases. Them and them,
above, he swung she jump he follow in "idolize but place animal to
more than the Apathy."
