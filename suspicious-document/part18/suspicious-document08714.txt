PREFACE

Many times I have been strongly advised to write a book on golf, and now I offer a volume to
the great and increasing public who are devoted to the game. So far as the instructional part
of the book is concerned, I may say that, while I have had the needs of the novice constantly
in mind, and have endeavoured to the best of my ability to put him on the right road to success,
I have also presented the full fruits of my experience in regard to the fine points of the
game, so that what I have written may be of advantage to improving golfers of all degrees of
skill. There are some things in golf which cannot be explained in writing, or for the matter
of that even by practical demonstration on the links. They come to the golfer only through
instinct and experience. But I am far from believing that, as is so often said, a player can
learn next to nothing from a book. If he goes about his golf in the proper manner he can learn
very much indeed. The services of a competent tutor will be as necessary to him as ever, and
I must not be understood to suggest that this work can to any extent take the place of that
compulsory and most invaluable tuition. On the other hand, it is next to impossible for a tutor
to tell a pupil on the links everything about any particular stroke while he is playing it,
and if he could it would not be remembered. Therefore I hope and think that, in conjunction
with careful coaching by those who are qualified for the task, and by immediate and constant
practice of the methods which I set forth, this book may be of service to all who aspire to
play a really good game. If any player of the first degree of skill should take exception to
any of these methods, I have only one answer to make, and that is that, just as they are explained
in the following pages, they are precisely those which helped me to win my five championships.
These and no others I practise every day upon the links. I attach great importance to the photographs
and the accompanying diagrams, the objects of which are simplicity and lucidity. When a golfer
is in difficulty with any particular stroke--and the best of us are constantly in trouble with
some stroke or other--I think that a careful examination of the pictures relating to that stroke
will frequently put him right, while a glance at the companion in the "How not to do it" series
may reveal to him at once the error into which he has fallen and which has hitherto defied
detection. All the illustrations in this volume have been prepared from photographs of myself
in the act of playing the different strokes on the Totteridge links last autumn. Each stroke
was carefully studied at the time for absolute exactness, and the pictures now reproduced were
finally selected by me from about two hundred which were taken. In order to obtain complete
satisfaction, I found it necessary to have a few of the negatives repeated after the winter
had set in, and there was a slight fall of snow the night before the morning appointed for
the purpose. I owe so much--everything--to the great game of golf, which I love very dearly,
and which I believe is without a superior for deep human and sporting interest, that I shall
feel very delighted if my "Complete Golfer" is found of any benefit to others who play or are
about to play. I give my good wishes to every golfer, and express the hope to each that he
may one day regard himself as complete. I fear that, in the playing sense, this is an impossible
ideal. However, he may in time be nearly "dead" in his "approach" to it.

I have specially to thank Mr. Henry Leach for the invaluable services he has rendered to me
in the preparation of the work

DIAGRAMS.

I have sometimes heard good golfers sigh regretfully, after holing out on the eighteenth green,
that in the best of circumstances as to health and duration of life they cannot hope for more
than another twenty, or thirty, or forty years of golf, and they are then very likely inclined
to be a little bitter about the good years of their youth that they may have "wasted" at some
other less fascinating sport. When the golfer's mind turns to reflections such as these, you
may depend upon it that it has been one of those days when everything has gone right and nothing
wrong, and the supreme joy of life has been experienced on the links. The little white ball
has seemed possessed of a soul--a soul full of kindness and the desire for doing good. The
clubs have seemed endowed with some subtle qualities that had rarely been discovered in them
before. Their lie, their balance, their whip, have appeared to reach the ideal, and such command
has been felt over them as over a dissecting instrument in the hands of a skilful surgeon.
The sun has been shining and the atmosphere has sparkled when, flicked cleanly from the tee,
the rubber-cored ball has been sent singing through the air. The drives have all been long
and straight, the brassy shots well up, the approaches mostly dead, and the putts have taken
the true line to the tin. Hole after hole has been done in bogey, and here and there the common
enemy has been beaten by a stroke. Perhaps the result is a record round, and, so great is the
enthusiasm for the game at this moment, that it is regarded as a great misfortune that the
sun has set and there is no more light left for play. These are the times when the golfer's
pulse beats strong, and he feels the remorse of the man with the misspent youth because he
was grown up and his limbs were setting before ever he teed a ball.

Well, at least I can say that I have not missed much of the game that I love with a great fondness,
for I played a kind of prehistoric golf when I was a bad boy of seven, and off and on I have
played it ever since. It was fortunate for me that the common land at Jersey was years ago
the ideal thing for a golfing links, and that golfers from abroad found out its secret, as
they always do. If they had failed to do so in this case, I might still have been spending
my life in horticultural pursuits. For I was born (on May 9, 1870) and bred in Jersey, at that
little place called Grouville, which is no more than a collection of scattered cottages and
farmhouses a few miles from St. Heliers. Both my parents were natives of Jersey, and my father,
who was seventy-four on the 5th of last November, has been a gardener there all his life, holding
the proud record of having changed his place of employment only once during the whole period.
There was a big family of us--six boys and two girls--and all, except one of my sisters, are
still alive. My brothers were George, Phil, Edward, Tom, and Fred, and I came fourth down the
list, after Edward. As most golfers know, my brother Tom, to whom I owe very much, is now the
professional at the Royal St. George's Club at Sandwich, while Fred is a professional in the
Isle of Man. In due course we all went to the little village school; but I fear, from all that
I can remember, and from what I have been told, that knowledge had little attraction for me
in those days, and I know that I very often played truant, sometimes for three weeks at a stretch.
Consequently my old schoolmaster, Mr. Boomer, had no particular reason to be proud of me at
that time, as he seems to have become since. He never enjoys a holiday so much in these days
as when he comes over from Jersey to see me play for the Open Championship, as he does whenever
the meeting is held at Sandwich. But when I did win a Championship on that course, he was so
nervous and excited about my play and my prospects that he felt himself unequal to watching
me, and during most of the time that I was doing my four rounds he was sitting in a fretful
state upon the seashore. I was a thin and rather delicate boy with not much physical strength,
but I was as enthusiastic as the others in the games that were played at that time, and my
first ambition was to excel at cricket. A while afterwards I became attached to football, and
I retained some fondness for this game long after I took up golf. Even after my golfing tour
in America a few years ago, when quite at my best, I captained the Ganton football team and
played regularly in its matches.
