 Looking on epistolary communications as a trust not to
be betrayed, I have invariably refused to deliver to the biographers of my departed friends
any letters of theirs that I might possess: the first application for them has always been
the signal for committing the whole budget to the flames.

This you know; and you say that the very precautions I have used will leave my memory more
completely at the mercy of ill-judging or ill- informed survivors, who, in the absence of more
authentic information, may draw on their own invention, and do me injustice. This is the plea
that has prevailed with me now: the uncertainty of mortal life, with the apprehension that
if suddenly removed I shall become the heroine of some strange romance, founded probably on
the facts of a life by no means deficient in remarkable incidents, but mixed up with a great
deal of fiction; and the consciousness that others may be thereby wounded, whom I would not
wish to wound--have decided me to act upon your suggestion, and to draw out a little sketch
of such matters as can alone concern the public in any way. Into private domestic History no
person possessed of a particle of delicacy can wish to intrude. It is melancholy to witness
the prying spirit that some are but too ready to cater to, for filthy lucre's sake: and grievous
to reflect that the boasted immunity which makes the cottage of the English peasant, no less
than the palace of the English noble, a castle--which so fences his domestic hearth that no
man may set foot within his door without his consent, or proclaim an untruth concerning him
without being legally compelled to render compensation, should be withdrawn from his grave.
I cannot tell you how I have blushed for the living, and kindled with resentment on behalf
of the dead, when contemplating the merciless desecration of what may truly be called the sacredness
of home, in some biographical notices.

You may therefore expect to find in these sheets a record of that mental and spiritual discipline
by which it has pleased the Lord to prepare me for the very humble, yet not very narrow, sphere
of literary usefulness in which it was his good purpose to bid me move; with whatever of outward
things, passing events, and individual personal adventure, as it is called, may be needful
to illustrate the progress. Of living contemporaries I shall of course not speak: of the dead
no further than as I would myself be spoken of by them, had I gone first. Public events I shall
freely discuss, and hold back nothing that bears on spiritual subjects. Nobody shall ever need
to be at the trouble of posthumously searching out and proclaiming my opinions on any topic
whatever, apart from personalities. I will not withhold, nor disguise, nor soften them down;
and if the charge of egotism be brought, let the accusers lay their hands upon their hearts,
and declare that they would not have sanctioned another in performing for me, as a defunct
writer, the office which nobody can fulfil half so well, because nobody can do it half so correctly,
as myself.

To commence the task, in which I earnestly implore the Father of all mercies and Teacher of
all truth to guide me, to guard me from misstatement, to preserve me from self-seeking, and
to overrule it to the glory of his great name, I must remind you that my birthplace was Norwich;
a fine old town, distinguished for its many antiquities, the beauty of its situation on a rising
ground, interspersed with a profusion of rich gardens, and studded with churches to the number
of thirty-five, including a majestic cathedral. Many years have elapsed since I last beheld
it, and perhaps the march of modern improvement has so changed its features, that were I now
to dwell upon my recollections of that cherished home, they would not be recognized. But I
cannot forget the early impressions produced on my mind by the peculiarities of the place;
nor must they be omitted here. The sphere in which it is my dearest privilege to labor, is
the cause of Protestantism; and sometimes when God has blessed my poor efforts to the deliverance
of some captive out of the chains of Popish delusion, I have recalled the fact of being born
just opposite the dark old gateway of that strong building where the noble martyrs of Mary's
day were imprisoned. I have recollected that the house wherein I drew my first breath was visible
through the grated window of their prison, and a conspicuous object when its gates unfolded
to deliver them to unjust judgment and a cruel death. Are any of the prayers of those glorified
saints fulfilled in the poor child who was brought into the world on that particular spot,
though at the distance of some ages? The query could not be answered, but the thought has frequently
cheered me on. The stern-looking gateway opening on St. Martin's plain, was probably one of
the very first objects traced on the retina of my infant eye, when it ranged beyond the inner
walls of the nursery; and often, with tottering step, I passed beneath that arch into the splendid
garden of our noble episcopal palace; and certainly, if my Protestantism may not be traced
to that locality, my taste may; for from all the elaborate display of modern architecture,
all the profuse luxuriance and endless variety of modern horticulture, I now turn away, to
feast in thought on the recollection of that venerable scene. The palace itself is a fine specimen
of the chaste old English style; but the most conspicuous, the most unfading feature, was the
cathedral itself, which formed the boundary of one-half of the garden; a mass of sober magnificence,
rising in calm repose against the sky, which, to my awe-struck gaze and childish imagination,
seemed to rest upon its exquisitely formed spire. Seated on the grass, busying my fingers with
the daisies that were permitted to spring around, I have been lost in such imaginings as I
suppose not many little children indulge in, while permitting my eyes to rove over the seemingly
interminable mass of old grey stone, and then to fall upon the pleasant flowers around me.
I loved silence, for nothing that fell on the ear seemed in accordance with what so charmed
the eye; and thus a positive evil found entrance in the midst of much enjoyment. I acquired
that habit of dreamy excursiveness into imaginary scenes, and among unreal personages, which
is alike inimical to rational pursuits and opposed to spiritual- mindedness. To a period so
early as the middle of my fourth year I can revert with the most perfect, most vivid recollection
of my habitual thoughts and feelings; and at that age, I can unhesitatingly declare, my mind
was deeply tinctured with a romance not derived from books, nor from conversation, but arising,
as I verily believe, out of the singular adaptation to each other of my natural taste and the
scenery amidst which it began to develop itself. Our abode was changed to another part of the
city before this period arrived; but the bishop's garden was still our haunt, and my supreme
delight.

An immense orchard, shrubbery, and flower-garden were attached to my father's new residence,
to which he had removed on account of its proximity to the church of which he was rector. This,
too, was an old- fashioned house, mantled with a vine, and straggling out, in irregular buildings,
along the slope of the garden. The centre of an immense grass-plot, studded with apple, pear,
and plum trees, was occupied by the most gigantic mulberry I ever beheld, the thick trunk of
which resembled that of a knotted oak, while in its forest of dark branches nestled a number
of owls and hats. Oh, how I loved to lurk beneath its shadow on a summer evening, and await
the twilight gloom, that the large owl might come forth and wheel around the tree, and call
out his companions with a melancholy hoot; while the smaller bat, dipping lower in his flight,
brushed by me, accustomed to my presence. I had entered betimes upon the pernicious study of
nursery tales, as they then were, and without having the smallest actual belief in the existence
of fairies, goblins, or any such things, I took unutterable delight in surrounding myself with
hosts of them, decked out in colors of my own supplying, gorgeous or terrible beyond the conception
of my classic authorities. The faculty of realizing whatever I pictured to myself was astonishingly
great; and you must admit that the localities in which I was placed were but too favorable
to the formation of a character which I have no doubt the enemy was secretly constructing within
me, to mislead, by wild, unholy fiction, such as should come within the range of its, influence.
To God be all the glory that I am not now pandering with this pen to the most grovelling or
the most impious of man's perverted feelings.

But above all other tastes, all other cravings, one passion reigned supreme, and that acme
of enjoyment to me was music. This also was met by indulgence as unlimited as its cravings;
for not only did my father possess one of the finest voices in the world, and the very highest
degree of scientific knowledge, taste, and skill in the management of it, but our house was
seldom without an inmate in the person of his most intimate friend and brother clergyman, a
son of the celebrated composer Mr. Linley, who was as highly gifted in instrumental as my father
was in vocal music. The rich tones of his old harpsichord seem at this moment to fill my ear
and swell my heart; while my father's deep, clear, mellow voice breaks in, with some noble
recitative or elaborate air of Handel, Haydn, and the rest of a school that may be superseded,
but never, never can be equalled by modern composers. Or the harpsichord was relinquished to
another hand, and the breath of our friend came forth through the reed of his hautboy in strains
of such overpowering melody, that I have hid my face on my mother's lap to weep the feelings
that absolutely wrung my little heart with excess of enjoyment. This was not a snare; or, if
it might have been made one, the Lord broke it in time, by taking away my hearing. I would
not that it had been otherwise, for while a vain imagination was fostered by the habit I have
before adverted to, this taste for music and its high gratification most certainly elevated
the mind. I do firmly believe that it is a gift from God to man, to be prized, cherished, cultivated.
I believe that the man whose bosom yields no response to the concord of sweet sounds, falls
short of the standard to which man should aspire as an intellectual being; and though Satan
does fearfully pervert this solace of the mind to most vile purposes, still I heartily agree
with Martin Luther, that, in the abstract, "the devil hates music."

Before I had completed my sixth year, I came under the rod of discipline which was to fall
so long and so perseveringly upon me ere I should "hear the rod and who had appointed it."
Enthusiastic in every thing, and already passionately fond of reading, I had eagerly accepted
the offer of a dear uncle, a young physician, to teach me French. I loved him, for he was gentle
and kind, and very fond of me; and it was a great happiness to trip through the long winding
street that separated us, to turn down by the old Bridewell, so celebrated as an architectural
curiosity, being built of dark flint stones, exquisitely chiselled into the form of bricks,
and which even then I could greatly admire, and to take my seat on my young uncle's knee, in
the large hall of his house, where stood a very large and deep-toned organ, some sublime strain
from which was to reward my diligence, if I repeated accurately the lesson he had appointed.
Thus between love for my uncle, delight in his organ, and a natural inclination to acquire
learning, I was stimulated to extraordinary efforts, and met the demand on my energies in a
very unsafe way. I placed my French book under my pillow every night, and starting from repose
at the earliest break of dawn, strained my sleepy eyes over the page, until, very suddenly,
I became totally blind.

This was a grievous blow to my tender parents: the eclipse was so complete that I could not
tell whether it was midnight or midnoon, so far as perception of light was concerned, and the
case seemed hopeless. It was, however, among the "all things" that God causes to work together
for good, while Satan eagerly seeks to use them for evil. It checked my inordinate desire for
mere acquirements, which I believe to be a bad tendency, particularly in a female, while it
threw me more upon my own resources, such as they were, and gave me a keen relish for the highly
intellectual conversation that always prevailed in our home. My father delighted in the society
of literary men; and he was himself of a turn so argumentative, so overflowing with rich conversation,
so decided in his political views, so alive to passing events, so devotedly and so proudly
the Englishman, that with such associates as he gathered about him at his own fireside, I don't
see how the little blind girl, whose face was ever turned up towards the unseen speaker, and
whose mind opened to every passing remark, could avoid becoming a thinker, a reasoner, a tory,
and a patriot. Sometimes a tough disputant crossed our threshold; one of these was Dr. Parr,
and brilliant were the flashes resulting from such occasional collision with antagonists of
that calibre. I am often charged with the offence of being too political in my writings: the
fact is, I write as I think and feel; and what else can you expect from a child reared in such
a nursery?

But another consequence of this temporary visitation was an increased passion for music. The
severe remedies used for my blindness frequently laid me on the sofa for days together, and
then my fond father would bring home with him, after the afternoon service of the cathedral,
of which he was also a canon, a party of the young choristers. My godfather would seat himself
at the harpsichord; the boys, led by my father, performed the vocal parts; and such feasts
of sacred music were served up to me, that I have breathed to my brother in an ecstatic whisper
the confession, "I don't want to see; I like music better than seeing."

That brother I have not before named; but that only brother was a second self. Not that he
resembled me in any respect, for he was beautiful to a prodigy, and I an ordinary child; he
was wholly free from any predilection for learning, being mirthful and volatile in the highest
degree; and though he listened when I read to him the mysterious marvels of my favorite nursery
books, I doubt whether he ever bestowed an after- thought on any thing therein contained. The
brightest, the sweetest, the most sparkling creature that ever lived, he was all joy, all love.
I do not remember to have seen him for one moment out of temper or out of spirits for the first
sixteen years of his life; and he was to me what the natural sun is to the system. We were
never separated; our studies, our plays, our walks, our plans, our hearts were always one.
That holy band which the Lord has woven, that inestimable blessing of fraternal love and confidence,
was never broken, never loosened between us, from the cradle to his grave; and God forbid that
I should say or think that the grave has broken it. If I have not from the outset included
that precious brother in my sketch, it was because I should almost as soon have deemed it necessary
to include by name my own head or my own heart. He too was musical, and sang sweetly, and I
cannot look back on my childhood without confessing that its cup ran over with the profusion
of delights that my God poured into it.

About this time, when my sight, after a few months' privation, was fully restored, I first
imbibed the strength of Protestantism as deeply as it can be imbibed apart from spiritual understanding,
Norwich was infamously conspicuous in persecuting unto death the saints of the Most High, under
the sanguinary despotism of popish Mary; and the spot where they suffered, called the Lollard's
pit, lies just outside the town, over Bishop's bridge, having a circular excavation against
the side of Moushold-hill. This, at least to within a year or two ago, was kept distinct, an
opening by the road-side. My father often took us to walk in that direction, and pointed out
the pit, and told us that there Mary burnt good people alive for refusing to worship wooden
images. I was horror-stricken, and asked many questions, to which he did not always reply so
fully as I wished; and one day, having to go out while I was inquiring, he said, "I don't think
you can read a word of this book, but you may look at the pictures: it is all about the martyrs."
So saying, he placed on a chair the old folio of Foxe's Acts and Monuments, in venerable black-letter,
and left me to examine it.

Hours passed and still found me bending over, or rather leaning against that magic book. I
could not, it is true, decipher the black-letter, but I found some explanations in Roman type,
and devoured them; while every wood-cut was examined with aching eyes and a palpitating heart.
Assuredly I took in more of the spirit of John Foxe, even by that imperfect mode of acquaintance,
than many do by reading his book through; and when my father next found me at what became my
darling study, I looked up at him with burning cheeks and asked, "Papa, may I be a martyr?"

"What do you mean, child?"

"I mean, papa, may I be burned to death for my religion, as these were? I want to be a martyr."

He smiled, and made me this answer, which I have never forgotten: "Why, Charlotte, if the government
ever gives power to the Papists again, as they talk of doing, you may probably live to be a
martyr."

I remember the stern pleasure that this reply afforded me; of spiritual knowledge not the least
glimmer had ever reached me in any form, yet I knew the Bible most intimately, and loved it
with all my heart as the most sacred, the most beautiful of earthly things. Already had its
sublimity caught my adoration; and when listening to the lofty language of Isaiah, as read
from his stall in the cathedral by my father in Advent, and the early Sundays of the year,
while his magnificent voice sent the prophetic denunciations pealing through those vaulted
aisles, I had received into my mind, and I think into my heart, that scorn of idolatry which
breathes so thrillingly in his inspired page. This I know, that at six years old the foundation
of a truly scriptural protest was laid in my character; and to this hour it is my prayer that
whenever the Lord calls me hence, he may find his servant not only watching but working against
the diabolical iniquity that filled the Lollard's pit with the ashes of his saints.

And now upon that all-important topic the Bible I would remark, that among the most invaluable
blessings of my life I remember the judicious conduct of my parents in regard to it. We generally
find that precious volume made a book of tasks; sometimes even a book of penalties: the consequence
of so doing cannot but be evil. With us it was emphatically a reward book. That identical book
is now before me, in its rich red cover, elegantly emblazoned with the royal arms; for it is
the very Bible that was placed before queen Charlotte at her coronation in 1761; and which,
becoming the perquisite of a prebendary of Westminster, was by his wife presented to my mother,
to whom she stood sponser. This royal Bible was highly prized; and it was with special favor
that it was opened for us when we had been good, and were deemed worthy of some mark of approval.
My father, then, whose voice made music of every thing, would read to us the history of Abel,
of Noah, of Moses, of Gideon, or some other of the exquisite narratives of the Old Testament.
I do not say that they were made the medium of conveying spiritual instruction; they were unaccompanied
by note or comment, written or oral, and merely read as histories, the fact being carefully
impressed on our minds that God was the author, and that it would be highly criminal to doubt
the truth of any word in that book. * * * The consequences of this early instruction, imparted
as an indulgence, I have reason daily to rejoice in: it led me to search for myself the inspired
pages; it taught me to expect beauties, and excellences, and high intellectual gratification
where God has indeed caused them to abound. As in the natural world we find the nutritious
fruit not lying like pebbles on the ground, but hung on graceful trees and shrubs, heralded
by fair and fragrant blossoms, embowered in verdant foliage, and itself beautifully shaped
and tinted; so has the Lord arranged that the garden where grows the fruit of the tree of life,
should abound in all that is most lovely to man's natural perception; and do we not slight
this bounteous care for our mind's enjoyment while he makes provision for our soul's sustenance,
when we neglect to point these things out to the notice of our children? The word was my delight
many a year before it became my counsellor; and when at last the veil was withdrawn from my
heart, and Jesus stood revealed as the Alpha and Omega of that blessed book, it was not like
gradually furnishing a vacant place with valuable goods, but like letting a flood of day into
one already most-richly stored with all that was precious; though, for lack of light whereby
to discern their real nature, the gems had been regarded but as common things. My memory was
plentifully stored with what it had been, my free choice to study; and when in the progress
of this little narrative you learn how mercifully I have been preserved from doctrinal error
in its various forms, through that full acquaintance with God's word, you will trace his marvellous
workings in thus furnishing my mind, as it were, with an armory of ready weapons, and will
be ready to echo with increased earnestness that emphatic declaration, "The Bible, the Bible
alone, is the religion of Protestants;" and not only to echo, but also to act upon it.

Religion, however, did at this early period of my life become a very important concern in my
eyes; our mother had taken infinite pains to assure us of one great truth--the omniscience
of an omnipresent God--and this I never could for a moment shake off. It influenced us both
in a powerful manner, so that if either committed a fault, we never rested until, through mutual
exhortation on the ground that God certainly knew it, and would be angry if we added deceit
to another error, we had encouraged each other to confession. We then went, hand in hand, to
our mother, and the one who stood clear of the offence acknowledged it in the name of the transgressor,
while both asked pardon. Never did children more abhor a lie: we spurned its meanness, while
trembling at its guilt; and nothing bound us more closely and exclusively together than, the
discoveries we were always making of a laxity among other children in this respect. On such
occasions we would shrink into a corner by ourselves and whisper, "Do they think God does not
hear that?" Self-righteousness, no doubt, existed in a high degree; we were baby Pharisees,
rejoicing in the external cleanliness of cup and platter; but I look back with great thankfulness
on the mercy that so far restrained us: an habitual regard to truth has carried me safely through
many a trial, and, as a means, guarded me from many a snare. It cannot be too early or too
strongly inculcated; nor should any effort be considered too great, any difficulty too discouraging,
any reprobation too strong, or, I will add, any punishment too severe, when the object in view
is to overcome this infamous vice in a child. Once I remember having been led into a lie at
the instigation, and through the contrivance of a servant- girl, for whose benefit it was told.
Suspicion instantly arose, from my dreadful embarrassment of manner; a strict investigation
commenced; the girl told me to face it out, for that nobody else knew of it, and she would
not flinch. But my terrors of conscience were insupportable; I could ill bear my father's steady
eye fixed on mine, still less the anxious, wondering, incredulous expression of my brother's
innocent face, who could not for a moment fancy me guilty. I confessed at once; and with a
heavy sigh my father sent to borrow from a neighbor an instrument of chastisement never before
needed in his own house. He took me to another room, and said, "Child, it will pain me more
to punish you thus, than any blows I can inflict will pain you; but I must do it; you have
told a lie--a dreadful sin, and a base, mean, cowardly action. If I let you grow up a liar,
you will reproach me for it one day; if I now spared the rod, I should hate the child." I took
the punishment in a most extraordinary spirit: I wished every stroke had been a stab; I wept
because the pain was not great enough; and I loved my father at that moment better than even
I, who almost idolized him, had ever loved him before. I thanked him, and I thank him still;
for I never transgressed in that way again. The servant was called, received her wages and
a most awful lecture, and was discharged the same hour. Yet, of all these things what sunk
deepest into my very soul were the sobs and cries of my fond little brother, and the lamentable
tones of his soft voice, pleading through the closed door, "O, papa, don't whip Charlotte.
O forgive poor Charlotte."

It is sweet to know we have a Brother indeed who always pleads, and never pleads in vain for
the offending child; a Father whose chastisements are not withheld, but administered in tender
love; judgment being his strange work, and mercy that wherein he delights, and the peaceable
fruits of righteousness the end of his corrections. The event to which I have referred may
appear too trivial a thing to record; but it is by neglecting trivial things that we ruin ourselves
and our children. The usual mode of training these immortal beings, the plan of leaving them
to servants and to themselves, the blind indulgence that passes by, with a slight reprimand
only, a wilful offence, and the mischievous misapplication of doctrine that induces some to
let nature do her worst, because nothing but grace can effectually suppress her evil workings;
all these are faulty in the extreme, and no less presumptuous than foolish: this has produced
that "spirit of the age" which, operating in a "pressure from without," is daily forcing us
further from the good old paths in which we ought to walk, and in which our forefathers did
walk, when they gave better heed than we do to the inspired word, which tells us, "Foolishness
is bound up in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him."

Affectionately yours,

C. E.

LETTER II.

YOUTH.

I have long been persuaded that there is no such thing as an honest private journal, even where
the entries are punctually made under present impressions. There is so much of positive, active
evil always at work in the mind, that to give a fair transcript of idle unprofitable thoughts
and corrupt imaginings, is out of the question: evil is dealt with in generals, good in particulars,
and the balance cannot be fairly struck. Those confessions of indwelling sin that remorse will
wring from us, and which perhaps are penned at the moment in perfect sincerity, being unaccompanied
with, the specifications that would invest them in their naturally hideous colors, beneath
the searching light of God's holy and spiritual law, wear the lovely garb of unfeigned humility.
The reader, coming to such self-condemnatory clauses, is struck with admiration at the saintly
writer's marvellous self-abasement, only lamenting that he should, in the excess of his lowly-mindedness,
have written such, bitter things against himself, at a time when he was grieving, resisting,
almost quenching the Holy Spirit within by obstinate transgression.

And if the present, how much more is the past liable to be glossed over? To be faithful here
is next to impossible, for Satan helps us to deceive ourselves and instructs us to carry out
the deception to others. This consideration might well cause the pen of autobiography to drop
from a Christian's hand, did not an earnest desire to glorify God in his merciful dealings,
together with the consciousness that to no other could the task he safely delegated, act as
a counterpoise to the discouragement. I do desire to magnify the exceeding riches of God's
grace to me, if I may do so without increasing the charge of arrogant assumption. I know that
among the diversity of gifts which he bestows on his creatures, he granted me a portion of
mental energy, a quickness of perception, a liveliness of imagination, an aptitude for expressing
the thoughts that were perpetually revolving in my mind, such as to fit me for literary occupation.
I know that Satan, to whom such instruments are exceedingly valuable, marked me as one who
would, if properly trained to it, do his work effectually within his own sphere; and I am not
more sure of my present existence than I am of the fact that he strove to secure me for that
purpose, from the first expanding of those faculties which evidently lie exposed to his observation
and open to his attacks, as far as God permits him to work. Can I feel all this, and not bless
the Lord, who so far baffled these designs, and deigned to appoint my field of labor within
the sacred confines of his own vineyard?

The visitation of which I have spoken had a powerful influence on my after-life; it rendered
the preservation of my newly-restored sight an object of paramount importance, to which the
regular routine of education must needs be sacrificed. A boarding-school had never been thought
of for me. My parents loved their children too well to meditate their expulsion from the paternal
roof; and the children so well loved their parents and each other that such a separation would
have been insupportable to them. Masters we had in the necessary branches of education, and
we studied together so far as I was permitted to study; but before it was deemed safe to exercise
my eyes with writing apparatus, I had stealthily possessed myself of a patent copy-book, by
means of which, tracing the characters as they shone through the paper, I was able to write
with tolerable freedom before any one knew that I could join two letters; and I well remember
my father's surprise, not unmixed with annoyance, when he accidentally took up a letter which
I had been writing to a distant relation, giving a circumstantial account of some domestic
calamity which had no existence but in my brain; related with so much pathos too, that my tears
had fallen over the slate whereon this my first literary attempt was very neatly traced. He
could not forbear laughing; but ended with a grave shake of the head, and a remark to the effect
that I was making more haste than good speed.

At this time, seven years of age, I became entangled in a net of dangerous fascination. One
evening my brother was taken to the theatre, while I, on account of a cold, had to stay at
home. To compensate for this, I was permitted to read the play to him; and that play was, "The
Merchant of Venice." I will not dwell upon the effect. I had already become fond of such theatrical
spectacles as were considered suitable for children--pantomime and broad farce--and like a
child I gazed upon the glitter, and enjoyed the bustle; but now, seated in a corner, all quiet
about me, and nothing to interfere with the mental world, I drank a cup of intoxication under
which my brain reeled for many a year. The character of Shylock burst upon me, even as Shakspeare
had conceived it. I revelled in the terrible excitement that it gave rise to; page after page
was stereotyped upon a most retentive memory without an effort, and during a sleepless night
I feasted on the pernicious sweets thus hoarded in my brain.

Pernicious indeed they were; for from that hour my diligence in study, my docility of conduct,
every thing that is usually regarded as praiseworthy in a child, sprung from a new motive.
I wanted to earn a reward, and that was no longer a sweet story from the Bible, but permission
to carry into my retreat a volume of Shakspeare. A taste so unusual at my age was hailed with
applause; visitors questioned me on the different plays, to ascertain my intimate acquaintance
with the characters; but no one, not even my father, could persuade me to recite a line, or
to listen when another attempted it, or to witness the representation of any play of Shakspeare.
This I mention to prove what a powerful hold the enemy of all godliness must have expected
to take on a spirit so attuned to romance. Reality became insipid, almost hateful to me; conversation,
except that of the literary men to whom I have alluded, a burden. I imbibed a thorough contempt
for women, children, and household affairs, intrenching myself behind invisible barriers that
few, very few, could pass. Oh how many wasted hours, how much of unprofitable labor, what wrong
to my fellow-creatures, what robbery of God, must I refer to this ensnaring book. My mind became
unnerved, my judgment perverted, my estimate of people and things wholly falsified, and my
soul wrapped in the vain solace of unsubstantial enjoyments during years of after sorrow, when
but for this I might have early sought the consolations of the gospel. Parents know not what
they do, when from vanity, thoughtlessness, or overindulgence, they foster in a young girl
what is called a poetical taste. Those things highly esteemed among men are held in abomination
with God; they thrust him from his creatures' thoughts, and enshrine a host of polluting idols
in his place.

My father, I am sure, wished to check the evil which, as a sensible man, he could not but foresee;
my state of health, however, won a larger portion of indulgence than was good for me. The doctors
into whose hands I had fallen, were of the school now happily very much exploded: they had
one panacea for almost every ill, and that was the perilous drug mercury. With it, they rather
fed than physicked me; and its deleterious effects on the nervous system were doubly injurious
to me, as increasing tenfold the excitability that required every curb. Among all the marvels
of my life, the greatest is that of my having grown up to be one of the healthiest of human
beings, and with an inexhaustible flow of even mirthful spirits; for certainly I was long kept
hovering on the verge of the grave by the barbarous excess to which medical experiments were
carried; and I never entertained a doubt that the total loss of my hearing before I was ten
years old, was owing to a paralysis induced by such severe treatment. God, however, had his
own purposes to work out, which neither Satan nor man could hinder. He overruled all for the
furtherance of his own gracious designs.

Shut out by this last dispensation from my two delightful resources, music and conversation,
I took refuge in books with tenfold avidity. By this time I had added the British poets generally
to my original stock, together with such reading as is usually prescribed for young ladies;
and I underwent the infliction of reading aloud to my mother the seven mortal volumes of Sir
Charles Grandison. It was in the fulfilment of this awful task that I acquired a habit particularly
mischievous and ensnaring--that of reading mechanically, with a total abstraction of mind from
what I was about. This became the easier to me from the absence of all external sound; and
its consequences are exceedingly distressing to this day, as experienced in a long-indulged,
and afterwards most bitterly lamented wandering of the mind in prayer and in reading the Scriptures.
In fact, through the prevalence of this habit, my devotions, always very punctually performed,
became such an utter lip-service, as frequently to startle and terrify my conscience, when
I found myself saying prayers and thinking idle songs or scraps of plays; but I regarded such
transient pangs of remorse as a satisfaction for the sin, and never dreamed of resisting the
general habit.

Thus far I had led a town life, residing in the heart of a populous city, enjoying indeed that
noble garden, but daily more and more absorbed in books of fancy. Happily, my health became
so affected that a removal into the country was judged necessary, and I forgave the doctors
all their past persecution of me, in consideration of their parting injunctions, which were,
that I was to have unbounded liberty; to live entirely in the open air, save when the weather
forbade; to be amused with all rural occupations; and especially to frequent farm-yards, for
the purpose of inhaling the breath of cows. My father exchanged parochial duty with a friend,
taking his village congregation, and engaging a house very near the church.

That tall white house, what a place it holds in my fond recollection. It was perfectly an old
parsonage, and behind it lay a garden larger than our city orchard, sloping gently down, with
a profusion of fruit and flowers, bounded by high walls, and the central walk terminating in
a door, beyond which lay the scene of our greatest enjoyment. A narrow slip of grass, fringed
with osiers and alders and willows, alone separated the wall from a very clear, lovely stream,
which winding half round an extensive common, turned a mill. This small river abounded with
fish, and we soon became expert anglers; besides which, on creeping to some distance by a path
of our own discovery, we could cross the stream on a movable plank, and take a wide range through,
the country. This removal was a double resource: it invigorated my bodily frame, until I outgrew
and out-bloomed every girl of my age in the neighborhood, while really laying a foundation
for many years of uninterrupted health, and a constitution to defy the change of climate for
which I was destined; while it won me from the sickening, enervating habit of sedentary enjoyment
over the pages of a book, which, added to the necessary studies and occupations, was relaxing
alike the tone of the bodily and mental frame. From the polluted works of man, I was drawn
to the glorious works of God; and never did bird of the air or beast of the field more luxuriate
in the pure bright elements of nature than I did. All the poetical visions of liberty that
had floated in my brain seemed now realized; all pastoral descriptions faded before the actual
enjoyment of rural life. Sometimes wreathing garlands of, wild flowers, reclined on a sunny
bank, while a flock of sheep strolled around, and the bold little lambs came to peep in our
faces, and then gallop away in pretended alarm; sometimes tearing our clothes to tatters in
an ardent hunt for the sweet filberts that hung high above our heads, on trees well fortified
behind breastworks of bramble and thorn; sometimes cultivating the friendship while we quaffed
the milk of the good-natured cows under the dairymaid's operation: all was freedom, mirth,
and peace. Often would my father take his noble pointers preparatory to the shooting season,
at once to try their powers and to ascertain what promise of future sport the fields presented.
These were destructive expeditions in one sense. I remember the following dialogue, repeated
to me by my brother, when we made our appearance at home after a day's demolition of wearing
apparel.

"Mr. B. this will never do; that girl cannot wear a frock twice without soiling it; nor keep
it whole for a week: the expense will ruin us."

"Well, my dear, if I am to be ruined by expense, let it come in the shape of the washerwoman's
and linen-draper's bills, not in those of the apothecary and undertaker."

My dear father was right; and it would be a happy thing for girls in general, if somewhat of
appearance, and of acquirement too, was sacrificed to what God has so liberally provided, and
to the enjoyment of which a blessing is undoubtedly annexed. Where, among females, do we find
the stamina of constitution and the elasticity of spirit which exist in those of our rural
population who follow outdoor employment? It positively pains me to see a party of girls, a
bonneted and tippeted double-file of humanity,

    "That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along,"

under the keen surveillance of a governess, whose nerves would never be able to endure the
shock of seeing them bound over a stream and scramble through a fence, or even toss their heads
and throw out their limbs as all young animals, except that oppressed class called young ladies,
are privileged to do. Having ventured, in a fit of my country daring, to break the ice of this
very rigid and frigid subject, I will recount another instance of the paternal good sense to
which I owe, under God, the physical powers without which my little talent might have been
laid by in a napkin all my days.

One morning, when his daughter was about eight years old, my father came in, and found sundry
preparations going on, the chief materials for which were buckram, whalebone, and other stiff
articles, while the young lady was under measurement by the hands of a female friend.

"Pray, what are you going to do to the child?"

"Going to fit her with a pair of stays."

"For what purpose?"

"To improve her figure; no young lady can grow up properly without them."

"I beg your pardon; young gentlemen grow up very well without them, and so may young ladies."

"O, you are mistaken. See what a stoop she has already; depend on it this girl will be both
a dwarf and a cripple if we don't put her into stays."

"My child may be a cripple, ma'am, if such is God's will; but she shall be one of his making,
not ours."

All remonstrance was vain; stays and every species of tight dress were strictly prohibited
by the authority of one whose will was, as every man's ought to be, absolute in his own household.
He also carefully watched against any evasion of the rule: a ribbon drawn tightly round my
waist would have been cut without hesitation by his determined hand; while the little girl
of the anxious friend whose operations he had interrupted, enjoyed all the advantages of that
system from which I was preserved. She grew up a wandlike figure, graceful and interesting,
and died of decline at nineteen; while I, though not able to compare shapes with a wasp or
an hour-glass, yet passed muster very fairly among mere human forms of God's moulding; and
I have enjoyed to this hour a rare exemption from headaches, and other ladylike maladies, that
appear the almost exclusive privilege of women in the higher classes.

This is no trivial matter, believe me; it has frequently been the subject of conversation with
professional men of high attainment, and I never met with one among them who did not, on hearing
that I never but once, and then only for a few hours, submitted to the restraint of these unnatural
machines, refer to that exemption, as a means, the free respiration, circulation, and powers
both of exertion and endurance with which the Lord has most mercifully gifted me. There can
be no doubt that the hand which first encloses the waist of a girl in these cruel contrivances,
supplying her with a fictitious support, where the hand of God has placed bones and muscles
that ought to be brought into vigorous action, that hand lays the foundation of bitter sufferings;
at the price of which, and probably of a premature death, the advantage must be purchased of
rendering her figure as unlike as possible to all the models of female beauty, universally
admitted to be such, because they are chiselled after nature itself. I have seen pictures,
and I have read harrowing descriptions, of the murderous consequences of thus flying in the
face of the Creator's skill, and presuming to mend, to improve, his perfect work; but my own
experience is worth a thousand treatises and ten thousand illustrations, in bringing conviction
to my mind. Once, when introduced, as it is called, to the public, through the medium of a
ballroom, I did join in persuading my father to allow of a fashionable lacing-up, though by
no means a tight one. I felt much as, I suppose, a frolicksome young colt feels when first
subjected to the goading apparatus that fetters his wild freedom. I danced, but it was with
a heavy heart and laboring breath; I talked, under the influence of a stupefying headache,
and on my return home flew to my apartment and cut the goodly fabric in pieces; nor was I ever
afterwards tempted so to tempt my all-wise Maker by saying to the frame that he had fashioned
and supplied with means of healthful growth, "Hitherto shalt thou go and no further."

Compressure of the feet was with equal strictness forbidden by my judicious father. This vain
custom is perhaps not so fatal as the other, but it produces many evils. Coldness of the extremities
may certainly exist where nothing of the kind has been practised; but while rejoicing that
I, experimentally, know nothing of it, I cannot help recollecting that the bounding pulse which
plays so joyously through my veins was never impeded in any part; and feeling this, I would
no more expose a girl to one infliction than I would to the other. Do Christian mothers take
a sufficiently serious and prayerful view of this subject, as regards their children? Do they
weigh, in a balance of God's providing, this necessary provision of clothing, to separate not
only what is unseemly for the woman professing godly simplicity, but what is enervating to
those physical powers which she is bound to devote to the Lord, and the weakening of which
is actual robbery of him? I fear we females are more ready to ask counsel one of another in
this matter than of the Lord; or even of our husbands, who, in nine cases out of ten, no doubt
would decide against the foolish and pernicious custom. At least, in all my arguments with
my own sex, I have found the men invariably siding with me upon this topic.

You will be tired of these digressions, my dear friend, but I set out by forewarning you that
my opinions would be freely stated; and while touching on a period of mortal life, where the
body no less than the mind usually takes its direction for the rest of our pilgrimage, I cannot
pass by any thing that appears to me of real importance to either. We will now return to what
poets have sung and citizens sighed for, time out of mind--the delights of rural life.

All cramping is decidedly bad: wholesome restraints there are, which parents are bound to lay
upon their children, and the latter to submit to; and among other things, I am sure a defined
method and regular habits in education, work, and play, together, with a most strict attention
to scrupulous punctuality, are not only valuable but indispensable to a right government of
the mind and conduct in after- life. 33. 34. Precedent (People. 14)-- "the Limey them acknowledge

wholly subversive of the frankness, the purity, the generous care for which earth can yield
no substitute, and the loss of which only transforms him who ought to be the tender preserver
of woman into her heartless destroyer. The girls are either grouped at home, with the blessed
privilege of a father's eye still upon them, or sent away in a different direction from their
brothers, exposed through unnatural and unpalatable restraints, to evils not perhaps so great,
but every whit as wantonly incurred as the others. The shyness, miscalled retiring modesty,
with which one young lady shrinks from the notice of a gentleman as though there were danger
in his approach, and the conscious coquettish air, miscalled ease, with which another invites
his notice, are alike removed from the reality of either modesty or ease. Both result from
a fictitious mode of education --both are the consequences of nipping in the bud those sisterly
feelings that lay a fair foundation for the right use of those privileges to which she looks
forward as a member of society; and if the subject be viewed through the clear medium of Christian
principle, its lights will become more brilliant, its shadows more dark, the longer and the
closer we contemplate it.

LETTER IV.

YOUTH.

Hitherto you have not heard of any spiritually minded person connected with my early life;
yet there was one, I feel sure, though my recollections are confused and imperfect on that
point; and one to whose prayers, if not to her teaching, I surely owe something.

My father's mother was a fine, sprightly, robust old lady, rather small in stature, and already
bending a little under the burden of years at the time when I first recollect her as mingling
in the visions of my childhood, though I know that even from infancy I was the delight of her
warm honest heart. She was simplicity itself in manners, her blunt speeches sometimes clashing
a little with her son's notions of polish and refinement, as also did her inveterate antipathy
to the reigning fashion, whatever that might be. I remember her reading me a lecture upon something
novel in the cut of a sleeve, ending by this remark: "I never wore a gown but of one shape;
and because I don't follow the fashion, the fashion is forced to come to me sometimes by way
of a change. I can't help that, you know, my dear; but I never was fashionable on purpose."
She added some pious remarks on vanity and folly, which I soon forgot; but the other dwelt
on my mind because it chimed in with my own love of independence--a prominent characteristic
with me; too often carried to the excess of self-willed obstinacy. However, I dearly loved
and exceedingly respected my grand mother, and used in my heart to glory in her smooth clean
locks, half brown, half grey, combed down from under a snowy cap of homely make, when she had
successfully resisted alike the entreaties and examples of contemporary dames, who submitted
their heads to the curling-irons and powder-puff of a frizeur, preparatory to an evening party.
I used to stand proudly at her knee, admiring the high color of her cheek, and uncommon brilliancy
of her fine dark hazle eye, while her voice, remarkably rich and clear, involuntarily swelled
the chorus parts of our magnificent music.

She was a Percy, not by name, for that had been lost in the female line some generations before,
but the pedigree in my possession shows how just was her vaunt in that respect. For vaunt it
she did, to us at least, often bringing it forward to check any tendency to behavior unbefitting
those who claimed descent from

    "The stout earl of Northumberland,"

with whom I ought to be well acquainted, for the singing of Chevy Chace in proper time and
tune with her, was the only secular accomplishment in which my dear grandmother personally
labored to perfect me, except knitting and curious old-fashioned needlework. The pride of ancestry
took strong hold of my mind, and such an ancestry accorded but too well with my romance, innate
and acquired. It stood me, many a time, in the stead of better things, when nerving myself
to endure affliction and wrong; and therefore I notice it, to warn you against exposing your
own children to the same snare.

Next to the fashion, if not in an equal or superior degree, I think my grandmother most abhorred
the French. Indeed her strongest denunciations against the reigning modes were usually clinched
with the triumphant assertion that they were "French fashions." No marvel if her spirit was
stirred within her by the horrors of revolutionary France, and her Protestantism strengthened
by the butcheries of "Ninety-eight." I knew that she was a protester and a tory of no common
stamp; and I knew that she brought her Bible forward in support of every opinion that she uttered.
Rarely did I visit her without finding her buried in the study of that blessed book; and I
know that she strove to teach me much of its meaning; but our change of residence proved a
great bar to personal intercourse, and she never wrote letters. I sometimes trace impressions
on my mind, made in early life, which I am sure must have been through her means, and though
the good seed died on the ground, while the weeds took root and flourished, still, here and
there a grain might sink below the surface, to spring up after many days.

And now I must record my first sorrow, although I cannot dwell upon it as on some other things.
My brother had been nearly two years absent, on service in the Peninsula, when an apoplectic
attack arrested my lather in the midst of life and health and vigor, and every promise of lengthened
years. The premonitory visitations of repeated strokes were disregarded, for we could not,
would not, realize the approach of such an event, and persisted in believing them nervous;
but just when all cause for alarm seemed at an end, and I was rejoicing in the assurance of
its being so, I was called from my pillow at midnight to see that tender and beloved parent
die. The bereavement was terrible to me: I had always been his principal companion, because
no one else in the family had a taste for those things in which he delighted--literature and
politics especially--and since my brother's departure, instead of seeking to replace him by
friends of my own age, I had turned wholly to my father, never desiring to pass an hour out
of his society, and striving to be to him both daughter and son. My mother was a perfect devotee
to household affairs, every thought occupied in seeking to promote the domestic comforts of
her family; while I, indulging a natural antipathy to all that did not engage the intellectual
powers, gave her no help there, I was truly cumbering the ground, seeking only my own gratification,
and dignifying my selfishness with many fine names, only because it was best indulged in my
own dear home. From the period of my loss of hearing, music had been wholly banished; my father
seemed to lose all relish for what could no longer minister enjoyment to me, and deeply I felt
the force of that affection which could so instantly and wholly overcome the ruling passion
of his mind, accompanied as it was with such exquisite skill in that delightful science as
rendered him the admiration of all who came within its influence. It redoubled my devotion
to him, and most bitter was the anguish of my heart when I beheld him taken away at a stroke.

Was this affliction sanctified to me? Not in the least. I found a luxury in grieving alone,
brooding on the past, and painting the probable future in any colors but those of reality.
My father had enjoyed two livings with a minor canonry in the cathedral, but the emolument
was very small, and his income had not allowed him, as yet, to make any provision for us. A
small annuity was all that my mother could depend on, and I resolved to become a novel-writer,
for which I was just qualified, both by nature and habits of thinking, and in which I should
probably have succeeded very well, but it pleased God to save me from this snare. My brother's
unexpected return on leave, with our subsequent changes of abode, paying visits among friends,
and keeping my thoughts constantly unsettled, hindered the execution of the project; and when
my brother returned to Portugal, we repaired to London, to make a long stay with some near
relations. It was there that I met with the gentleman, an officer on leave of absence, whose
wife, at the end of six months, I became.

I am longing to arrive at that period when the light of the glorious gospel of Christ first
shone upon me through the darkness of many trying dispensations; therefore I pass by much that
intervened, including my dear brother's marriage, who returned again to London with his bride
and his mother, to resume his staff situation there; and shall only take you with me across
the Atlantic, for a few Nova Scotian reminiscences, before proceeding to the scene of my most
precious recollections, dear Ireland. My husband had joined his regiment in Halifax, and sent
me a summons to follow him out without delay; in order to which I was obliged to embark in
a large vessel taken up partially by government for the conveyance of troops, but in which
there was a select party, occupying the state cabin, and making their own terms with the captain
for the best possible accommodation and provision on the passage. Of this number was I; and
certainly a more select, polished and agreeable party of highly bred gentlemen could not have
been found. I went under the kind care of one of these, with his wife, who had invited me to
travel with them.

Have you ever been at sea? It is a question the answer to which will throw very little light
on the matter, unless you also state how it agreed with you: no two races on the earth can
be more distinct than those two are upon the water--the people who are sea-sick and the people
who are not. It was my happy privilege to belong to the latter class; I never for a moment
experienced even an unpleasant sensation from any marine cause, but on the contrary enjoyed
exemption from all physical annoyances during a five weeks' voyage, excepting that of hunger.
An abundant supply of every thing that was nourishing, in the most palatable form, left no
excuse for remaining hungry; nevertheless the demand was incessantly kept up; and I appeal
to all who have been similarly affected, whether the munching of hard sea-bread from morning
to night under the pressure of a real sea appetite, is not a greater luxury than the choicest
viands on shore. To me it certainly was; and surely I had reason to be deeply thankful to the
Lord, who, by means of that delicious voyage, and its bracing exhilarating effects, prepared
me for a trying winter in the singular climate for which I was bound.

Every day, and all day long, be the weather what it might, I was stationed on deck, generally
seated on the highest point of the ship's stern, directly over the rudder, to enjoy a full
view of that most graceful and exquisite spectacle, a large vessel's course through the mighty
deep. Ours was a splendid one, a West Indiaman, almost rivalling the sea-palaces of the East
India Company, and manned in the first style. The troops on board, under the command of a field
officer, greatly added to the effect and comfort of the thing, for nothing is so conducive
to the latter as military discipline, well and mildly maintained. Although our party was perfectly
distinct from those who went out entirely at the charge of government, consisting of several
officers and their wives, yet we too were nearly all military, including the commandant, and
were strictly amenable to martial law. Of course that soul of domestic and social comfort,
punctuality, reigned paramount; every meal was regulated by beat of drum, subordination carefully
preserved, and decorum, to the most minute particular, insisted on. No dishabille could appear,
in the cabin or on deck; no litter, not an article of luggage visible. All the sick people,
all the cross people, and all the whimsical people were stowed away in their respective berths,
and such drawing-room elegance, combined with the utmost freedom of good-humor and the unrestrained
frankness that results from a consciousness of proper restraint, pervaded our little select
coterie, amounting to seventeen gentlemen and two ladies, that it did not need the miserable
contrast which I afterwards experienced on the homeward passage, to assure me we were among
the most favored of ocean travellers.

How very much do they err who consider the absence of order and method as supplying greater
liberty or removing a sense of restraint. Such freedom is galling to me; and in my eyes, the
want of punctuality is a want of honest principle; for however people may think themselves
authorized to rob God and themselves of their own time, they can plead no right to lay a violent
hand on the time and duties of their neighbor. I say it deliberately, that I have been defrauded
of hundreds of pounds, and cruelly deprived of my necessary refreshment in exercise, in sleep,
and even in seasonable food, through this disgraceful want of punctuality in others, more than
through any cause whatsoever besides. It is also very irritating; for a person who would cheerfully
bestow a piece of gold, does not like to be swindled out of a piece of copper; and of many
an hour have I been ungenerously wronged, to the excitement of feelings in themselves far from
right, when I would gladly have so arranged my work as to bestow upon the robbers thrice the
time they made me wantonly sacrifice. To say, "I will come to you on such a day," leaving the
person to expect you early, and then, after wasting her day in that uncomfortable, unsettled
state of looking out for a guest, which precludes all application to present duties, to come
late in the evening--or to accept an invitation to dinner, and either break the engagement
or throw the household into confusion by making it wait--to appoint a meeting, and fail of
keeping your time--all these, and many other effects of this vile habit are exceedingly disgraceful,
and wholly opposed to the scriptural rules laid down for the governance of our conduct one
to another. I say nothing of the insult put upon the Most High, the daring presumption of breaking
in upon the devotions of his worshippers, and involving them in the sin of abstractedness from
the solemn work before them, by entering late into the house of prayer. Such persons may one
day find they have a more serious account to render on the score of their contempt of punctuality,
than they seem willing to believe.

But I have run away from my ship--yet not so; for as every thing shines out most by contrast,
it was natural to think on the ugly reverse when recalling the beautiful harmony and order
of our regulations on board. We were favored with most delightful weather, fresh and dry and
warm; with only one day's hard rain, during which the sea "ran mountains," as the sailors said.
I was conducted on deck, "just for one minute, that you may be able to say you have seen such
a sea," remarked the gentleman who put a military cloak over me, and led me up the stairs.
But who could be satisfied with a momentary sight of any thing so stupendously grand? I resisted
all efforts to persuade me into retreating again, and it ended in my being lashed to the mizenmast
by my friendly conductor, who declared that his head, the best landsman's head on board, would
not stand the giddy scene; in short, that he should be obliged to report himself sick, and
exchange our agreeable society below for the solitude of his berth. Of course I dismissed him,
and was left among the mountains, alone, save when a sailor passed me on his duties among the
rigging, and gave me a smile of approval, while the man at the wheel seemed to regard me as
being under his especial patronage. The tars love one who does not flinch from their own element.

Truly, I saw that day the works of the Lord and his wonders in the great deep. Imagine yourself
in a ship, large among vessels, but a mere cork upon the waters of that mighty main. On every
side, turn where you would, a huge mountain of irregular form was rising-dark, smooth, of unbroken
surface, but seeming about to burst from over-extension. How did you come into that strange
valley? how should you get out of it? how avoid the rush of that giant billow that even now
overhangs your bark? These questions would inevitably rush through the mind; but in a second
of time the huge body beside you sunk, you were on its summit, and another came rolling on.
Meanwhile the ship would reel, with a slow slanting movement that gradually lowered the tall
masts till the yards almost dipped in the brine, and you were either laid back on the frame-
work behind you, or well-nigh suspended, looking down upon the water over the ship's bulwarks.
I soon discovered why my companion had so carefully buckled the leather strap that held me
to the mast; certainly I cannot recall the scene with such steadiness of nerve as I beheld
it with. Every now and then a small billow would burst upon the vessel's side, sending its
liquid treasure across the deck, and more than one ablution of the kind was added to the fresh-water
drenching bestowed by the clouds. Can you fancy the discomfort of such a situation? Then you
were never at sea, or at least you left your imagination ashore; for I defy any person not
well inured to it, to look on such a scene with so negative a feeling as discomfort; it will
excite either terror or delight sufficient to engross the whole mind.

I well remember that, when deeply affected by the grandeur of this and other aspects assumed
by the majestic main, I found the highest flights of man's sublimity too low. They would not
express, would not chime in with my conceptions; and I was driven to the inspired pages for
a commentary on the glorious scene. It was then that the language of Job, of Isaiah, of Habakkuk,
supplied me with a strain suited to the sublime accompaniment of God's magnificent work. Sunrise
I could not witness, because at that hour no lady might appear on deck, and my cabin had not
a side-window; but sunset, moonlight, starlight, with the various phenomena of ocean's ever-varying
appearance, these furnished an endless contemplation with which nothing could accord but the
language of Holy writ. I did not bring forth my Bible, well knowing the bantering remarks to
which it would have exposed me on the score of affectation, but my memory served me equally
well in that as in profane poetry; and many a precious word of warning, exhortation, and promise
did I recite, enchanted by the sublimity of what, as to its spiritual meaning, was still an
unknown tongue to me. Among these, the thirty-second of Deuteronomy, the fortieth of Isaiah,
and other passages full of the gospel, were repeatedly called to mind; and above all, in blowing
weather, the forty-sixth Psalm delighted me.

You may suppose that I could not wholly forget the fact of being where, in the strictest sense,
there was but a step between me and death. The first day of our voyage some one had quoted
the expression, "There is but a plank between us and eternity," not with any serious application,
but as a fine thought. I do not think that I was ever for a moment unmindful of this; the presence
of actual danger was always felt by me: but concerning eternity I had no fears whatever. A
general reliance on the boundless mercy of God, a recognition of Christ as having suffered
for our sins, and a degree of self-righteousness that easily threw my sins into the shade,
while magnifying my supposed merits, these formed the staff whereon I leaned; and when the
most imminent and appalling peril overhung us, so that we expected to be ingulfed in the waves
without hope of succor, I looked it boldly in the face, confident in my false hope. Although
just then revelling in enjoyments best suited to my natural taste, life had in reality no charms
for me. From all that had gilded the sonny hours of youth I was completely severed, and the
world on which I had launched was a wilderness indeed in comparison with the Eden I had left.
I would not have made the slightest effort to escape from death in any form; and though I was
not senseless enough to prefer an eternity of untried wretchedness to the fleeting sorrows
of mortal life, yet as my conscience was lulled to rest by the self-delusion that I suffered
more than I deserved, and had therefore a claim on divine justice, and as I was willing to
receive the supposed balance of such debtor and creditor account in the world to come, I was
perfectly content to be summoned to my reward. Blessed be God that I was not taken away in
that hour of blind willingness.

The extreme peril to which I have alluded overtook us when within a short distance of our destination;
we were suddenly caught by a tremendous wind from the south, which blew us right in the direction
of Cape Sable, one of the most fatal headlands in those seas. Night closed upon us and the
gale increased; sails were spread, in a desperate hope of shifting the vessel's course, but
were instantly torn into ribbons. At one time, for a moment, the rudder broke loose, the tiller-rope
giving way under the violent strain upon it; and the next minute the spanker-boom, an immense
piece of timber, snapped like a reed. It was an awful scene: on the leeside the ship lay so
low in the water that every thing was afloat in the sleeping cabins; and the poor ladies were
screaming over their terrified children, unheeded by the gentlemen, every one of whom was on
deck. The captain openly declared we were bound for the bottom, if a very sudden and unlikely
change of wind did not take place. In the midst of all this, I was reported missing, and as
I had the privilege of being every body's care, because, for the time being, I belonged to
nobody, a search was commenced. A young officer found me, at last, so singularly situated,
that he went and reported me to the captain. I had climbed three tiers of lockers in the state
cabin, opened one of the large stern windows, and was leaning out, as far as I could reach,
enraptured beyond expression with the terrific grandeur of the scene. The sky above was black
as midnight and the storm could make it, overhanging us like a large pall, and rendered awfully
visible by the brilliancy of the waters beneath. I had heard of that phosphorescent appearance
in the sea, but never could have imagined its grandeur, nor can I essay to describe it. Even
in perfect stillness the illuminated element would have looked magnificent; what, then must
it have been in a state of excessive, tumultuous agitation, the waves swelling up to a fearful
height and then bursting into sheets of foam; every drop containing some luminous animalcula
sparkling with vivid, yet delicate lustre? We were going with headlong speed before the wind,
and I hung right over the track of the rudder, a wild, mad eddy of silver foam, intermingled
with fire. There was something in the scene that far overpassed all my extravagant imaginings
of the terribly sublime. The hurry, the fierceness, the riot of those unfettered waters, the
wild flash of their wondrous lights, the funereal blackness of the overhanging clouds, and
the deep, desperate plunge of our gallant ship, as she seemed to rend her way through an opposing
chaos--it was perfect delirium; and no doubt I should have appeared in keeping with the rest
to any external observer, for I was stretching out at the window, the combs had fallen from
my hair, which streamed as wildly as the rent sails; and I was frequently deluged by some bursting
wave, as the dip of the vessel brought me down almost to the surface. The peril of an open
window was startling to those on deck, and the captain, hearing that I refused to relinquish
my post, sent the mate to put up the dead-lights; so I sat down on the floor, buried my face
in my hands, and strove to realize the magnificence thus rent from my sight.

Yes, God's works in the great deep are indeed wonders. Nothing landward can possibly approach

 It seems to me every whit as unnatural as that the member of a Christian
family should forego all the sweets of conjugal, parental, filial, fraternal love, in the determination
to feel an equal regard for his neighbor's wife, husband, etc., as for his own; and, moreover,
to take an equal concern in the affairs of his neighbor's kitchen as in his own household matters.
This sort of generalizing regard would throw our respective establishments into singular confusion,
and might betray ourselves into sundry false positions, and very awkward predicaments. However,
the comparative extinction of natural affection would form the most prominently reprehensible
feature in the case; and I cannot but think that the boasted cosmopolitanism of some good people
would wear an aspect not very dissimilar, if rightly and soberly viewed. Certainly I could
no more tear the love of country from my heart, than I could the love of kindred; and when
my step again pressed the English strand, it was with a sensation almost resembling the fabled
invigoration of the Titans, who derived new life, new strength, new enterprise, from coming
in contact with their mother earth.

England, indeed, contained little that was personally endearing to me, except my beloved surviving
parent; but it was a joyous thing to embrace her once more, after the deep roll of the ocean
had separated us for nearly three years; during a portion of which she had been learning to
prize her native land, in a disgusting region of all that is most directly opposed to liberty,
civil or religious--to honorable feeling, just conduct, honest principle, or practical decency.
In short, she had been in Portugal.

LETTER V.

IRELAND.

I now arrive at an epoch from which I may date the commencement of all that deserves to be
called life, inasmuch as I had hitherto been living without God in the world. My existence
was a feverish dream of vain pleasure first, and then of agitations and horrors. My mind was
a chaos of useless information, my character a mass of unapplied energies, my heart a waste
of unclaimed affections, and my hope an enigma of confused speculations. I had plenty to do,
yet felt that I was doing nothing; and there was a growing want within my bosom, a craving
after I know not what--a restless, unsatisfied, unhappy feeling, that seemed in quest of some
unknown good. How this was awakened, I know not; it was unaccompanied with any conviction of
my own sinfulness, or any doubt of my perfect safety as a child of God. I did not anticipate
any satisfaction from change of place; but readily prepared to obey a summons from my husband
to follow him to Ireland, whither he had gone to engage in a law-suit. To be sure I hated Ireland
most cordially; I had never seen it, and as a matter of choice would have preferred New South
Wales, so completely was I influenced by the prevailing prejudice against that land of barbarism.
Many people despise Ireland, who, if you demand a reason, will tell you it is a horrid place,
and the people all savages; but if you press for proofs and illustrations, furthermore such
deponents say not.

On a dull day in April I took my place, a solitary traveller, in the Shrewsbury coach, quite
ignorant as to the road I was to travel, and far less at home than I should have been in the
wildest part of North America, or on the deck of a ship bound to circumnavigate the globe.
We rattled out of London, and the first thing that at all roused my attention was a moonlight
view of Oxford, where we stopped at midnight to change horses. Those old grey towers, and mighty
masses of ancient building, on which the silvery ray fell with fine effect, awoke in my bosom
two melancholy trains of thought; one was the recollection of my father, whose enthusiastic
attachment to his own university had often provoked warm discussion with the no less attached
Cantabs of our old social parties, and who often held out to me, as the greatest of earthly
gratifications, a visit with him to that seat of learning which he would describe in glowing
colors. But where was my father now? His poor girl, the delight of his eyes and treasure of
his heart, was in Oxford, with none to guide, none to guard, none to speak a cheering word
to her. I shrunk back in the coach, and grieved over this till a sudden turning once more threw
before me the outline of some magnificent old fabric bathed in moonlight, and that called up
a fit of patriotism, calculated to darken, yet more the prospect before me. This was England,
my own proud England; and these "the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces," that distinguished
her seats of learning above all others, I was bound for Ireland. What English young lady had
ever studied the history of that remote, half-civilized settlement, called Ireland? Not I,
certainly, nor any of my acquaintance; but I took it for granted that Ireland had no antiquities,
nothing to distinguish her from other barbarous lands, except that her people ate potatoes,
made blunders, and went to mass. I felt it a sort of degradation to have an Irish name, and
to go there as a resident; but comforted myself by resolving never in one particular to give
in to any Irish mode of living, speaking, or thinking, and to associate only with such as had
been at least educated in England.

The next day's rising sun shone upon Stratford-on-Avon; and here revived in some degree my
Shakspearian mania, to the still higher exaltation of my English stilts, and the deeper debasement
of all "rough Irish kernes." At Shrewsbury we parted with a kind old lady, who had shown me
some good-natured attentions, and I was left with only an elderly gentleman, bound also for
Dublin, who told me we must start at three o'clock the following morning for Holyhead. I was
dreadfully dejected, and told him I hoped he would not think the worse of me for being so utterly
alone, and that he would excuse my retiring to my own apartment the instant we had dined. He
took pencil and paper, and with a glow of benevolent feeling expressed his anxious desire to
take the same care of me that he would of his own daughter, and to look on me as his especial
charge, until he should give me into the hands of my lawful protector. I thanked him with true
English reserve, and a coldness that seemed rather to grate on his warm feelings; and having
owned that his seeing my Newfoundland dog well fed and lodged would be a great obligation,
I withdrew to fret alone over my exile to this foreign land. You may call this an exaggeration,
but it is no such thing. I delight in dwelling upon my reluctant approach to the land that
I was to love so fondly.

Next day my miseries were alleviated by the enchanting beauties of the Welsh country through
which we passed; and my regard for Mr. D---- greatly increased by the compassionate care he
took of a poor sickly woman and her ragged infant, whom he descried on the top of the coach,
and first threw his large cloak to them, then, with my cordial assent, took them inside, and
watched them most kindly until he fell asleep. I peeped into his kind, benevolent face, and
inwardly confessed there might be some nice people in Ireland.

At the inn where we dined, I made another acquaintance. A younger, but middle-aged man, whose
vivacity, combined with Welch mutton and ale, quite raised my spirits. Hearing from Mr. D----
with what enthusiasm I had admired the scenery of Llangollen, he volunteered to hand me in
at the coach window, a note of every remarkable place we should approach during the rest of
the journey; adding, "I know the road pretty well, having traversed it at least twice a year
for sixteen years, passing to and from my Irish home." He was a legal man, a finished gentleman,
and another sad drawback on my perverse prejudices. Mr. F---- proved an excellent descriptive
guide, punctually reaching to me from the roof of the coach his little memoranda, in time for
me to take a survey of the object concerned; and also most assiduously aiding in the care of
my luggage and dog when we were all put into the ferry-boat.

There was then no bridge over the Menai, and I being in total ignorance of the route was not
a little dismayed at the embarkation, forgetting that Holyhead was in Anglesea, and that Anglesea
was an island. At last, when the boat pushed off, the opposite shore being hidden under the
mist of deepening twilight, I addressed the ferryman in a tone of remonstrance that infinitely
diverted the whole party, "Surely you are not going to take me over in this way to Ireland?"

"No, no," said Mr. F----, "you shall have a good night's rest, and a better sea-boat, before
we start for the dear green isle."

Steamers were not then upon the packet station, and the wind being unfavorable, we had a passage
of seventeen hours, not landing until two in the morning of Easter Sunday. Nothing could exceed
my discomfort, as you may suppose, when I tell you that after paying my bill at Holyhead, I,
in a fit of abstraction, deposited it very safely in my purse, and in its stead threw away
my last bank-note. The mistake was not suspected until in mid-voyage I examined the state of
my finances, and found the sum total to amount to one shilling. This was an awful discovery;
my passage was paid, but how to reach Dublin was a mystery, and such was the untamed pride
of my character that I would sooner have walked there than confessed to the fact, which might
have been doubted, and laid myself under the obligation of a loan which I was sure of repaying
in a few hours, even to good old Mr. D----. When I stepped from the deck of the packet upon
the plank that rested against the pier of Howth I had not one single halfpenny in my pocket,
and I experienced, without the slightest emotion, one of the most hairbreadth escapes of my life.

The water was very low; the plank of course sloped greatly, and as soon as I set my foot on
it began to slide down. In another second I should have been plunged between the vessel's side
and the stone pier, without any human possibility of rescue; and already I had lost my balance,
when a sailor, springing on the bulwarks, caught me round the knees, and at the same instant
Mr. F----, throwing himself on the ground, seized and steadied the plant, until I recovered
my footing and ran up. I shudder to recall the hardened indifference of my own spirit, while
the kind, warm-hearted Irishmen were agitated with strong emotion, and all around me thanking
God for my escape. Each of my friends thought I had landed under the care of the other; while
one had my dog and the other my portmanteau. I received their fervent "cead-mille-failthe"
with cold politeness, and trod with feelings of disgust on the dear little green shamrocks
that I now prize so fondly.

We went to the hotel, and Mr. D---- proposed my retiring to a chamber until the coach started;
but my empty purse would not allow of that, so I said I preferred sitting where I was. Refreshments
were ordered; but though in a state of ravenous hunger, I steadily refused to touch them, for
I would not have allowed another person to pay for me, and was resolved to conceal my loss
as long as I could. I was excused, on the presumption of a qualmishness resulting from the
tossing of the ship; and most melancholy, most forlorn were the feelings with which I watched
through the large window the fading moonbeams and the dawning day. To my unspeakable joy, the
two gentlemen proposed taking a postchaise with me to Dublin, the expense being no more and
the comfort much greater than going by coach; and having requested Mr. F---- to keep an exact
account of my share in the charges, I took my seat beside them with a far lighter heart; my
dog being on the footboard in front of the carriage.

Away we drove, our horses being young, fresh, and in high condition. It was a glorious morning,
and vainly did I strive not to admire the scenery, as one after another of the beautiful villas
that adorn the Howth road gleamed out in the snowy whiteness that characterizes the houses
there, generally embosomed in trees and surrounded by gardens on the rising grounds. We were
descending the hilly road very rapidly, when by some means the horses took fright, and broke
into a full-gallop, crossing and re-crossing the road in a fearful manner. The driver was thrown
on the footboard, poor Tajo hung by his chain against the horses' legs, and our situation was
most critical. I had suffered from one upset in America, and resolved not to encounter another;
so quietly gathering my long riding-habit about me with one hand, and putting the other out
at the window, I opened the door, and with one active spring flung myself out. You know the
extreme peril, the almost certain destruction of such a leap from a carriage at full speed;
I did not, or certainly I would not have taken it. However, at that very instant of time, the
horses made a dead stop, and the chaise remained stationary only a few paces in advance of me.

Was not the hand of God here? Oh, surely it was, in the most marked and wonderful manner. No
cause could be assigned for the arrest of the animals; the driver had lost the reins, and no
one was near. I had fallen flat on the road-side, just grazing my gloves with the gravel and
getting a good mouthful of the soil, with which my face was brought into involuntary contact.
In a moment I sprung to my feet, and blowing it out, exclaimed with a laugh, "Oh well, I suppose
I am to love this country after all, for I have kissed it in spite of me." I then ran to help
my dog out of his disagreeable state of suspension, and returned to my friends, who were frightened
and angry too, and who refused to let me into the chaise unless I positively promised not to
jump out any more. To shorten the tale, I reached the Hibernian hotel, where my husband was,
seized some money, and paid my expenses without any one having discovered that I was a complete
bankrupt up to that minute.

I have been very prolix here; for I cannot overlook a single incident connected with this eventful
journey. Never did any one less anticipate a blessing or look for happiness than I in visiting
Ireland. I cannot enter into more particulars, because it would involve the names of friends
who might not wish to figure in print; but if these pages ever meet the eyes of any who gave
me the first day's welcome in Dublin, let them be assured that the remembrance of their tender
kindness, the glowing warmth of their open hospitality, and their solicitude to make the poor
stranger happy among them, broke through the ice of a heart that had frozen itself up in most
unnatural reserve, and gave life to the first pulse that played within it of the love that
soon pervaded its every vein--the love of dear, generous Ireland.

My first journey into the interior was to the King's county, where I passed some weeks in a
house most curiously situated, with an open prospect of ten miles pure bog in front of it.
Being newly built, nothing had yet had time to grow; but its owner, one of the most delightful
old gentlemen I ever met with, had spared no cost to render it commodious and handsome. He
was a fine specimen of the hospitable Irish gentleman, and took great pleasure in bringing
me acquainted with the customs of a people and the features of a place so new to me. Indeed
it was my first introduction to what was really Irish, for Dublin is too much of a capital
to afford many specimens of distinct nationality. On that great festival of the peasantry,
St. John's eve, Mr. C---- resolved on giving his tenants and neighbors a treat that should
also enlighten me on one of their most singular relics of paganism. It is the custom at sunset
on that evening to kindle numerous immense fires throughout the country, built like our bonfires
to a great height, the pile being composed of turf, bog-wood, and such other combustibles as
they can gather. The turf yields a steady, substantial body of fire, the bog-wood a most brilliant
flame; and the effect of these great beacons blazing on every hill, sending up volumes of smoke
from every point of the horizon, is very remarkable. Ours was a magnificent one, being provided
by the landlord as a compliment to his people, and was built on the lawn, as close beside the
house as safety would admit. Early in the evening the peasants began to assemble, all habited
in their best array, glowing with health, every countenance full of that sparkling animation
and excess of enjoyment that characterizes the enthusiastic people of the land. I had never
seen anything resembling it, and was exceedingly delighted with their handsome, intelligent,
merry faces; the bold bearing of the men, and the playful but really modest deportment of the
maidens; the vivacity of the aged people, and the wild glee of the children. The fire being
kindled, a splendid blaze shot up, and for a while they stood contemplating it, with faces
strangely disfigured by the peculiar light first emitted when bog-wood is thrown on; after
a short pause, the ground was cleared in front of an old blind piper, the very beau ideal of
energy, drollery, and shrewdness, who, seated on a low chair, with a well-replenished jug within
his reach, screwed his pipes to the liveliest tunes, and the endless jig began.

An Irish jig is interminable, so long as the party holds together; for when one of the dancers
becomes fatigued, a fresh individual is ready to step into the vacated place quick as thought,
so that the other does not pause, until in like manner obliged to give place to a successor.
They continue footing it, and setting to one another, occasionally moving in a figure, and
changing places with extraordinary rapidity, spirit, and grace. Few indeed among even the very
lowest of the most impoverished class have grown into youth without obtaining some lessons
in dancing from the travelling dancing-masters of their district; and certainly, in the way
they use it, many would be disposed to grant a dispensation to the young peasant, which they
would withhold from the young peer. It is, however, sadly abused among them, to Sabbath-breakings,
revellings, and the most immoral scenes, where they are congregated and kept together under
its influence; and the same scene enacted a year afterwards would have awoke in my mind very
different feelings from those with which I regarded this first spectacle of Irish hilarity,
when I could hardly be restrained by the laughing remonstrances of "the quality" from throwing
myself into the midst of the joyous group and dancing with them. Here was the old pagan worship
of Baal, if not of Moloch too, carried on openly and universally in the heart of a nominally
Christian country, and by millions professing the Christian name. I was confounded, for I did
not then know that Popery is only a crafty adaptation of pagan idolatries to its own scheme;
and while I looked upon the now wildly excited people with their children, and in a figure
all their cattle, passing again and again through the fire, I almost questioned in my own mind
the lawfulness of the spectacle, considered in the light that the Bible must, even to the natural
heart, exhibit it in to those who confess the true God. There was no one to whom I could breathe
such thoughts, and they soon faded from my mind: not so the impression made on it by this fair
specimen of a population whom I had long classed with the savage inhabitants of barbarous lands,
picturing them to myself as dark, ferocious, discontented, and malignant. That such was the
reverse of their natural character I now began to feel convinced; and from that evening my
heart gradually warmed towards a race whom I found to be frank, warm, and affectionate, beyond
any I had ever met with.

My interest in them, however, was soon to be placed on another and a firmer basis. I took up
my permanent abode in a neighboring county; and within six months after that celebration of
St. John's eve, I experienced the mighty power of God in a way truly marvellous. Great and
marvellous are all his works, in creating, in sustaining, in governing this world of wonderful
creatures; but Oh, how surpassingly marvellous and great in redeeming lost sinners, in taking
away the heart of stone and giving a heart of flesh, and making his people willing in the day
of his power! I have carefully abstained from any particulars respecting myself that could
either cast a reproach on the dead or give pain to the living; I shall do so still, and merely
remark, that as far as this world was concerned, my lot had no happiness mingled in it, and
that my only solace under many grievous trials consisted in two things: one was a careful concealment
of whatever might subject my proud spirit to the mortification of being pitied when I desired
rather to be envied; and the other a confident assurance, that in suffering afflictions silently,
unresistingly, and uncomplainingly, I was making God my debtor to a large amount. What desperate
wickedness of a deceived and deceitful heart was this! The very thing in which I so arrogantly
vaunted myself before God was the direct result of personal pride, in itself a great sin; and
thus I truly gloried in my shame. I never looked beyond the rod to Him who had appointed it;
but satisfying myself that I had not merited from man any severity, my demerits at the hand
of the Most High were wholly put out of the calculation. Thus, of course, every stroke drove
me further from the only Rock of refuge, and deeper into the fastness of my own vain conceits.
Added to this, I was wholly shut out from all the ordinary means by which the Lord usually
calls sinners to himself. There was no gospel ministry then within my reach; nor could I, if
it were provided, have profited by it, owing to my infirmity, (deafness.) Into Christian society
I had never entered, nor had the least glimmer of spiritual light shone into my mind. My religion
was that of the Pharisee, and my addresses to God included, like his, an acknowledgment that
it was by divine favor I was so much better than my neighbors. Reality had so far chased away
romance, that my old favorite authors had little power to charm me; and the hollowness of my
affected gayety and ease made society a very sickening thing. * * *

At the time I am now to speak of, I was living in perfect seclusion, and uninterrupted solitude.
Captain ---- was always in Dublin, and my chief occupation was in hunting out, and transcribing
and arranging matter for the professional gentlemen conducting the lawsuit, from a mass of
confused family papers and documents. Our property consisted of a large number of poor cabins
with their adjoining land, forming a complete street on the outskirts of the town, which was
greatly in arrear to the head landlords, and a periodical "distress" took place. On these occasions
a keeper was set over the property, some legal papers were served, and the household goods--consisting
of iron kettles, wooden stools, broken tables, a ragged blanket or two, and the little store
of potatoes, the sole support of the wretched inhabitants--were brought out, piled in a long
row down the street, and "canted," that is, put up to sale, for the payment of perhaps one
or two per cent. of the arrears. This horrified me beyond measure: I was ashamed to be seen
among the people who were called our tenants, though this proceeding did not emanate from their
immediate landlord; and every thing combined to render the seclusion of my own garden more
congenial to me than any wider range.

It was then that I came to the resolution of being a perfect devotee in religion: I thought
myself marvellously good; but something of monastic mania seized me. I determined to emulate
the recluses of whom I had often read; to become a sort of Protestant nun; and to fancy my
garden, with its high stone-walls and little thicket of apple-trees, a convent enclosure. I
also settled it with myself to pray three or four times every day, instead of twice; and with
great alacrity entered upon this new routine of devotion.

Here God met and arrested me. When I kneeled down to pray, the strangest alarms took hold of
my mind. He to whom I had been accustomed to prate with flippant volubility in a set form of
heartless words, seemed to my startled mind so exceedingly terrible in unapproachable majesty,
and so very angry with me in particular, that I became paralyzed with fear. I strove against
this with characteristic pertinacity; I called to mind all the commonplace assurances respecting
the sufficiency of a good intention, and magnified alike my doings and my sufferings. I persuaded
myself it was only a holy awe, the effect of distinguished piety and rare humility, and that
I was really an object of the divine complacency in no ordinary degree. Again I essayed to
pray, but in vain; I dared not. Then I attributed it to a nervous state of feeling that would
wear away by a little abstraction from the subject; but this would not do. To leave off praying
was impossible, yet to pray seemed equally so. I well remember that the character in which
I chiefly viewed the Lord God was that of an Avenger, going forth to smite the first-born of
Egypt; and I somehow identified myself with the condemned number. Often, after kneeling a long
time, I have laid my face upon my arms, and wept most bitterly, because I could not, dared
not pray.

It was not in my nature to be driven back easily from any path I had entered on; and here the
Lord wrought on me to persevere resolutely. I began to examine myself, in order to discover
why I was afraid; and taking as my rule the ten commandments, I found myself sadly deficient
on some points. The tenth affected me as it never had done before. "I had not known lust,"
because I had not understood the law when it said, "Thou shalt not covet." A casual glance
at the declaration of St. James, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, yet offend in one point,
he is guilty of all," alarmed me exceedingly; and on a sudden it occurred to me that not only
the ten commandments, but all the precepts of the New Testament, were binding on a Christian;
and I trembled more than ever.

What was to be done? To reform myself, certainly, and become obedient to the whole law. Accordingly
I went to work, transcribed all the commands that I felt myself most in the habit of neglecting,
and pinned up a dozen or two texts around my room. It required no small effort to enter this
apartment and walk round it, reading my mementos. That active schoolmaster, the law, had got
me fairly under his rod, and dreadful were the writhings of the convicted culprit, I soon,
however, took down my texts, fearing lest some one else might see them, and not knowing they
were for myself, be exasperated. I then made a little hook, wrote down a list of offences,
and commenced making a dot over against each, whenever I detected myself in the commission
of one. I had become very watchful over my thoughts, and was honest in recording all evil;
so my book became a mass of black dots; and the reflection that occurred to me of omissions
being sins too, completed the panic of my mind. I flung away my book into the fire, and myself
into an abyss of gloomy despair.

How long this miserable state of mind lasted, I do not exactly remember; I think about two
weeks. I could not pray. I dared not read the Bible, it bore so very hard upon me. Outwardly,
I was calm and even cheerful, but within reigned the very blackness of darkness. Death, with
which I had so often sported, appeared in my eyes so terrible, that the slightest feeling of
illness filled my soul with dismay. I saw no way of escape: I had God's perfect law before
my eyes, and a full conviction of my own past sinfulness and present helplessness, leaving
me wholly without hope. Hitherto I had never known a day's illness for years; one of God's
rich mercies to me consisted in uninterrupted health, and a wonderful freedom from all nervous
affections. I knew almost as little of the sensation of a headache as I did of that of tight-lacing;
and now a violent cold, with sore throat, aggravated into fever by the state of my mind, completely
prostrated me. I laid myself down on the sofa one morning and waited to see how my earthly
miseries would terminate; too well knowing what must follow the close of a sinner's life.

I had not lain long, when a neighbor hearing I was ill, sent me some books just received from
Dublin, as a loan, hoping I might find some amusement in them. Listlessly, wretchedly, mechanically,
I opened one; it was the memoir of a departed son, written by his father. I read a page describing
the approach of death, and was arrested by the youth's expressions of self-condemnation, his
humble acknowledgment of having deserved at the Lord's hand nothing but eternal death. "Ah,
poor fellow," said I, "he was like me. How dreadful his end must have been; I will see what
he said at last, when on the very brink of the bottomless pit." I resumed the book, and found
him in continuation glorifying God that though he was so guilty and so vile, there was ONE
able to save to the uttermost, who had borne his sins, satisfied divine justice for him, opened
the gates of heaven, and now waited to receive his ransomed soul.

The book dropped from my hands. "O, what is this? This is what I want: this would save me.
Who did this for him? Jesus Christ, certainly; and it must be written in the New Testament."
I tried to jump up and reach my Bible, but was overpowered by the emotion of my mind. I clasped
my hands over my eyes, and then the blessed effects of having even a literal knowledge of scripture
were apparent. Memory brought before me, as the Holy Spirit directed it, not here and there
a detached text, but whole chapters, as they had long been committed to its safe but hitherto
unprofitable keeping. The veil was removed from my heart, and Jesus Christ, as the Alpha and
Omega, the sum and substance of every thing, shone out upon me just as he is set forth in the
everlasting gospel. It was the same as if I had been reading, because I knew it so well by
rote, only much more rapid, as thought always is. In this there was nothing uncommon; but in
the opening of the understanding, that I might UNDERSTAND the scriptures, was the mighty miracle
of grace and truth. There I lay, still as death, my hands still folded over nay eyes, my very
soul basking in the pure, calm, holy light, that streamed into it through the appointed channel
of God's word. Rapture was not what I felt; excitement, enthusiasm, agitation, there was none.
I was like a person long enclosed in a dark dungeon, the walls of which had now fallen down,
and I looked round on a sunny landscape of calm and glorious beauty. I well remember that the
Lord Jesus, in the character of a shepherd, of a star, and above all, as the pearl of great
price, seemed revealed to me most beautifully: that he could save every body I at once saw;
that he would save me, never even took the form of a question. Those who have received the
gospel by man's preaching may doubt and cavil; I took it simply from the Bible, in the words
that God's wisdom teacheth, and thus I argued: "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners:
I am a sinner; I want to be saved: he will save me." There is no presumption in taking God
at his word: not to do so is very impertinent: I did it, and I was happy.

After some time I rose from the sofa, and walked about. My feelings were delicious. I had found
HIM of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write; I had found the very Paschal Lamb
whose blood would be my safeguard from the destroying angel. Oh, how delicious was that particular
thought to me. It was one of the first that occurred, and I laughed with gladness. Indeed my
feeling was very joyous, and I only wanted somebody to tell it to. I had two servants, one
a young woman, the other a little girl, both papists, both loving me with Irish warmth. They
were delighted to see me so well and happy on a sudden; and in the evening I bade them come
to my room, for I was going to read a beautiful book, and would read it aloud. I began the
gospel of St. Matthew, and read nine chapters to them, their wonder and delight increasing
my joy. Whenever I proposed leaving off, they begged for more; and only for my poor throat,
I think we should have gone on till day. I prayed with them, and what a night's rest I had!
Sleep so sweet, a waking so happy, and a joy so unclouded through the day, what but the gospel
could bestow? Few, very few, have been so left alone as I was with the infallible teaching
of God the Holy Ghost by means of the written word, for many weeks, and so to get a thorough
knowledge of the great doctrines of salvation, unclouded by man's vain wisdom. I knew not that
in the world there were any who had made the same discovery with myself. Of all schemes of
doctrine I was wholly ignorant, and the only system of theology open to me was God's own. All
the faculties of my mind were roused and brightened for the work. I prayed, without ceasing,
for divine instruction; and took, without cavilling, what was vouchsafed. On this subject I
must enter more largely, for it is one of immense importance.

LETTER VI.

RELIGIOUS PROGRESS.

I am standing before you now in the character of one who, having been brought under conviction
of sin into utter self-despair, had found in Christ Jesus a refuge from the storm of God's
anger. I felt myself safe in him; but as the revelation which God had made to man was not confined
to the sole point of a satisfaction for the sins of men, I felt it my bounden duty to search
for all that the Most High had seen good to acquaint his people with. At the same time I found
myself a member of a church calling itself Christian; but I too had called myself a Christian,
while as yet wholly ignorant of Christ, therefore I could not depend upon a name. I knew that
there were other churches, each putting in a claim to a higher and purer standard than its
neighbors, and it behooved me to know which of them all was in the right, I had no books of
a religious character--not one; no clergyman among my acquaintance, no means of inquiry, save
as regarded my own church, whose Liturgy and Articles lay before me. I resolved to bring them
first to the test of scripture, and if they failed, to look out for a better.

How I commenced the work and pursued it, I need not state. I tried every thing, as well as
I could, by the Bible; and my satisfaction was great to find the purest, clearest strain of
evangelical truth breathing through the book which I had used all my life long, as I did the
Bible, without entering into its real meaning. How I could possibly escape seeing the doctrines
of faith, regeneration, and the rest of God's revelation in them both, was strange to me; but
I understood that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, and mourned
over the darkness that I supposed universal.

I found it distinctly stated by our Lord, that "except a man be born again, he cannot see the
kingdom of God;" and this served as a key to many passages in the epistles and other parts
of scripture illustrative of the same solemn truth. I had never understood, never thought of
this. Did my church hold it? Yes; it was not only laid down as a fundamental doctrine in her
Articles, but constantly put into the mouths of her congregation, either expressed or clearly
implied. Again, I found that not by works but by faith I was to be justified before God; and
this also ran through the prayer-book, with unvarying distinctness; though with that book in
my hand and its contents on my lips I had been hitherto attempting to scale heaven by a ladder
of my own forming.

The Athanasian creed brought to my recollection a circumstance that had occurred a few years
before, the importance of which had never been known to me until I was brought acquainted with
the saving truths of the gospel. I now looked back upon it with trembling joy and gratitude
to him who had preserved me from a snare into which the pride of intellect, joined to spiritual
ignorance, would have been sure to lead me, but for the watchful care of my heavenly Father,
still working by means of my blind but sincere reverence for his word. In my native town, Socinianism
flourished to a fearful extent; it has long been a very hotbed of that fatal heresy, the holders
of which are found among many leading characters of wealth, influence, and high attainments.
I knew no more of it than that it was one of the many forms of dissent with which I had nothing
to do. I was acquainted with several of its disciples; but as religion formed no part of our
social intercourse, its peculiarities were wholly unknown to me.

Not long before my trip to America I had been staying in Norwich, in the same house with a
most clever, intelligent, and amiable woman, of whom I was very fond. I knew her to be a dissenter,
and that was all. One evening she drew me into a conversation, the commencement of which I
forget, but it soon arrived at a denial, on her part, of the Godhead of Christ, which exceedingly
astonished me, for I never supposed that could be called in question. I ran for the Bible,
saying, I would soon show her it was not to be disputed; and she in return asserted that I
could not prove it out of the inspired scriptures. After pondering for a while, I recollected
the first chapter of Revelation, which, for its sublimity, I ranked among the highest of my
poetical gems, and that it unequivocally proclaimed the divinity of our glorious Lord. I opened
at it, on which she burst into a laugh, saying, "You are not so weak as to fancy that book
of riddles any part of God's word!" "Why it is in the Bible, you see," replied I, half indignantly.
"And who put it there? Come, you are a person of too much sense to believe that the binding
up of certain leaves between the two covers of the Bible makes them a part of it. You must
exercise the reason that God has given you, and in so doing you will discover so many interpolations
and deceptions in that version of yours, that you will be glad to find a more accurate one."

She continued in the same strain for some time. I was greatly agitated; I closed the great
Bible, and leaning on it with folded arms, my heart beating violently against the bright red
cover, I gave heed to all she said. My love of novelty, passion for investigation, and the
metaphysical turn that had sometimes made my father quite uneasy about me, when he saw me at
eight years old poring over abstruse reasonings with the zest of an old philosopher, were all
in her favor. I felt as if the foundation of my faith was giving way, and I was being launched
on a sea of strange uncertainty. When she concluded, I laid my forehead on the book in most
deep and anxious thought. I did not pray: God was found of one who sought him not, for surely
he alone dictated my answer. I started up, and with the greatest vivacity said, "Mrs. ----,
if you can persuade me that the book of Revelation is not inspired, another person may do the
same with regard to the book of Genesis, and so of all that lie between them, till the whole
Bible is taken away from me. That will never do; I cannot part with my dear Bible. I believe
it all, every word of it, and I am sure I should be miserable if I did not." Then, kissing
the precious volume with the affection one feels for what is in danger of being lost to us,
I carried it back to its shelf, and declined any further discussion on the subject. She told
some one else she was sure of having me yet; but the good providence of God interposed to remove
me from the scene of danger.

That metaphysical turn I omitted to mention among my early snares; my father checked it, although
it was a great hobby of his own. He had seen its fearful abuse in the origin of the French
revolution, and regarded it as one of the evil spirits of the age. I recollect the mixture
of mirth and vexation depicted in his face one morning, when on his remarking that I did not
look well and inquiring if any thing ailed me, I replied, "No, but I could not get any sleep."

"What prevented your sleeping?"

"I was thinking, papa, of 'Cogito, ergo sum'--'I think, therefore I exist'--and I lay awake,
trying to find out all about it."

"'Cogito, ergo sum!'" repeated my father, laughing and frowning at the same time; "what will
you be at twenty, if you dabble in metaphysics before you are ten? Come, I must set you to
study Euclid; that will sober your wild head a little." I took the book with great glee, delighted
to have a new field of inquiry, but soon threw it aside. Mathematics and I could never agree.
Speculative and imaginative in an extraordinary degree, carrying much sail with scarcely any
ballast, what but the ever watchful care of Him who sitteth upon the circle of the earth could
have preserved from fatal wrecking a vessel so frail, while yet without pilot, helm, or chart?

It was the recollection of my short encounter with the Socinian that satisfied me respecting
the Athanasian creed. I felt that had I taken up its bold assertions and established every
one of them, as now I did, by scripture, no sophistry could have staggered my faith, though
it had been but a reasoning, not a saving faith, in that high doctrine of the coexistent, coequal
Trinity. I did not then know--for of all church history I was ignorant--that its original object
was not so much to establish a truth, as to detect and defeat a falsehood. The damnatory clauses,
as they are called, did not startle me. I saw clearly the fact that God had made a revelation
of himself to man, which revelation man was not at liberty to receive or to reject, and as
without faith it is impossible to please God, and that alone is faith which implicitly believes
the record that he hath given of his Son, the deductions in question were perfectly fair and
orthodox. I frequently wondered, when subsequently brought into the arena of various controversies,
at the ease with which, aided by the Bible alone, I settled so many disputed points; and as
it really was by the Bible I settled them, man's teaching has never yet on any subject altered
my views. * * *

Whether it be regarded as presumptuous or not, I must thankfully avow that during the weeks
when I was left alone with my Bible, I obtained a view of the whole scheme of redemption and
God's dealings with man, which to this hour I have never found reason to alter in any one respect,
save as greater light has continually broken in on each branch of the subject, strengthening,
not changing those views. You will see in the progress of my sketch, how complete a bulwark
against error in numberless shapes I have found in this simple adherence to the plain word
of truth--this habit of bringing every proposition "to the law and to the testimony;" fully
persuaded that "if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."

I now proceed to an interesting epoch in my life: the commencement of my literary labors in
the Lord's cause. It marks very strongly the overruling hand of Him who was working all things
after the counsel of his own will; and I will give it you without curtailment, together with
my introduction, through it to the Christian community of the land.

My life, as I told you, was solitary and retired; my time chiefly passed in writing out documentary
matters for the lawyers. The circumstance of my using the pen so incessantly became known,
and I was looked on as a literary recluse. One day a lady personally unknown to me, but whose
indefatigable zeal was always seeking the good of others, sent me a parcel of tracts. With
equal wonder and delight I opened one of them, a simple, spiritual little production; and the
next that I took up was an inducement to distribute tracts among the poor. From this I learned
that some excellent people were engaged in a work quite new to me; and, with a sigh, I wished
I had the means of contributing to their funds. Presently the thought flashed upon me, "Since
I cannot give them money, may I not write something to be useful in the same way?" I had just
then no work before me, and a long winter evening at command. I ordered large candles, told
the servants not to interrupt me, and sat down to my novel task. I began about seven o'clock,
and wrote till three in the morning; when I found I had produced a complete little story, in
the progress of which I had been enabled so to set forth the truth as it is in Jesus, that
on reading it over I was amazed at the statement I had made of scriptural truth, and sunk on
my knees in thankfulness to God. Next morning I awoke full of joy, but much puzzled as to what
I should do with my tract. At length, in the simplicity of my heart, I resolved to send it
to the bishop of Norwich, and busied myself at the breakfast- table in computing how many franks
it would fill. While thus employed, a note was put into my hands from Miss D----, apologizing
for the liberty taken, saying she had sent me, the day before, some tracts, and as she heard
I was much occupied with the pen, it had occurred to her that I might be led to write something
myself; in the possibility of which she now enclosed the address of the secretary to the Dublin
Tract Society, to whom such aid would be most welcome.

I was absolutely awe-struck by this very striking incident. I saw in it a gracious acceptance
of my freewill offering at His hands to whom it had been prayerfully dedicated; and in two
hours the manuscript was on its way to Dublin, with a very simple letter to the secretary.
A cordial answer, commendatory of my tract and earnestly entreating a continuance of such aid,
soon reached me, with some remarks and questions that required a fuller communication of my
circumstances and feelings. He had recommended frequent intercourse with the peasantry, of
whose habits and modes of expression I was evidently ignorant, and I then mentioned my loss
of hearing as a bar to this branch of usefulness, His rejoinder was the overflowing of a truly
Christian heart, very much touched by an artless account of the Lord's dealings with me; and
greatly did my spirit rejoice at having found a brother in the faith thus to cheer and strengthen
me.

But alas, a few days afterwards, Miss D----, whom I had still never seen, wrote to apprize
me that this excellent man had ruptured a blood- vessel and was dying. Still he did not forget
me, but after lingering for some weeks, on his death-bed commended me to the friendship of
his brother, who from that period proved a true and valuable helper to me.

Meanwhile I was beginning to take a view of popery, under the light of the gospel. As yet,
I knew nothing of it spiritually; and my retired life kept me from observing how it worked
among the poor people around. My attention was first directed to it by a conversation with
the younger of my two servants; she slept in my apartment, and I remarked that while kneeling
at her devotions she not only uttered them with amazing rapidity, but carried on all the while
the operation of undressing, with perfect inattention to what she was saying. I asked her the
purport of her prayers; she told me she said the "Our Father," and then the "Hail Mary:" at
my request she repeated the latter, and I gave her a gentle lecture on the irreverence of chattering
to God so volubly, and of employing herself about her clothes at the same time; adding that
she should be devout, deliberate, and quiet while speaking to God; but as for the Virgin Mary
it was no matter how she addressed her, if address her she would, for being only a dead woman
she could know nothing about it. This, I am ashamed to say, was the extent of my actual protest
at that time. The girl took it all very readily, and ever after, during her address to God,
she knelt with her hands joined, repeating the words slowly and seriously; but the moment she
commenced the "Hail Mary," to make up for lost time she prattled it so rapidly, and tore open
the fastenings of her dress with such bustling speed, that I could scarcely refrain from laughing.
A little reflection, however, convinced me it was an act of idolatry, and no laughing matter;
and from that time I inquired as deeply as I could into their faith and practice; constantly
showing them from the scriptures how contrary their religion was to that of the gospel. Still
it was but a very partial and superficial view that I could as yet obtain of the great mystery
of iniquity through these ignorant and thoughtless girls; and to this must be attributed my
sad failure in not warning them more distinctly to come out of Babylon. I rather tried to patch
up the old, decayed, tattered garment with the new piece of the gospel, as many more have done;
and so made the rent worse, instead of replacing the vile article with one of God's providing.

      *       *       *       *       *

When that excellent man, Mr. D----, was committed to the grave, his younger brother visited
me on his way back to Dublin. That interview I shall never forget; he talked to me out of the
overflowings of a heart devoted to Christ, and left me pining for more extended enjoyment of
Christian society. I was not long ungratified; within three days an unexpected summons took
me to Dublin, and on the very evening of my arrival Mr. D---- introduced me to a party of about
thirty pious friends, assembled to meet a missionary just returned from Russia. Remember these
were the frank, unrestrained, warmhearted Irish, of all people the most ready at expressing
their zealous and generous feelings; and imagine, if you can, my enjoyment, after such a long
season of comparative loneliness, when they came about me with the affectionate welcome that
none can utter and look so eloquently as they can. I thought it a foretaste of heavenly blessedness;
and yet I often longed for those seasons when I had none but my God to commune with, and poured
out to him all that now I found it delightful to utter to my fellow- creatures. Then, my tabernacle
was indeed pitched in the wilderness, and the candle of the Lord shone brightly upon it; now,
the blending of many inferior lights distracted my mind from its one object of contemplation,
and broke the harmony that was so sweet in its singleness.

A few months after this, the lawsuit being ended, my husband was ordered abroad. I declined
to cross the Atlantic a second time, and from this period I became chiefly dependent on my
own exertions. My mother had joined me in Ireland, having been made a partaker in the like
precious faith and hope with myself. * * *

LETTER VII.

KILKENNY.

We took up our abode in the town of Kilkenny, so richly blessed with gospel privileges, and
so far removed from the annoyances to which I was exposed while trying to fulfil the landlord's
part over a property inextricably involved, and now also placed in the hands of trustees. I
had sought the maintenance of that character for the sake of the poor tenants, whose affection,
for me was very great, and among whom I had of late been frequently allowed to read the scriptures.
The necessity, however, of providing for myself, and the hopeless perplexities of my nominal
office, between head-landlords, under-tenants, trustees, a receiver, and all the endless machinery
of an embarrassed little Irish estate, compelled me to seek a more quiet sphere; and in Kilkenny
I found all that could combine to encourage me in the pursuit of honest independence in the
way of usefulness. I finished "Osric," which formed a good-sized volume, and commenced the
pleasant task of writing penny and twopenny books for the Dublin Tract Society, who paid me
liberally, and cheered me on my path with all the warmth of Christian affection. It was indeed
a delightful task, and God had raised up to me also a friend to whose truly paternal kindness
I owe more than ever can be told, Mr. George Sandford, now Lord Mountsandford, who, from our
first acquaintance, entered with a father's interest into all that concerned me. Thus encouraged,
I held on my way, and tasted the sweets that I hope to enjoy to the end of my days--those of
the original curse brightened by the irreversible blessing: "In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread;"

I have already told you my escape from the snare of Socinianism; and now I am to narrate a
trial of faith and doctrine which by the mercy of God produced effects just the reverse of
what was intended. This was no less than a vigorous attempt to convert me to Popery. I had
not yet bestowed any great attention on the details of that abominable device, but was most
fully persuaded of its being a system of idolatrous delusion, the working of which was strikingly
manifested in the wretchedness, the immorality, the turbulence and degrading superstitions
of the poor creatures around me. It never had been my practice to tamper with or to compromise
what I knew to be wrong; therefore I had not suffered curiosity to lead me within the walls
of a mass-house, nor in any way to put on the semblance of an agreement which cannot really
exist between the temple of God and idols. I believed Popery to be the Babylon of the Apocalypse,
and I longed for resolution to proclaim to the deluded victims, "Come out of her, my people,"
This I had never done, but on the contrary fell cheerfully in with the then cautious policy
of my friends, and so framed my little books and tracts as to leave it doubtful whether they
were written by a Protestant or not. Paul to the Jews became as a Jew, that he might gain the
Jews: I, by a false process of reason, thought it allowable to become as an idolater to the
idolaters, that I might gain the idolaters. An awful, presumptuous sin! The Jew possesses the
fair blossom of gospel truth, which by kindly fostering is to be expanded and ripened into
the rich fruit: the Papist holds in his hand an apple of Sodom, beneath the painted rind of
which is a mass of ashes and corruption. He must be induced to fling it away, and to pluck
from the tree of life a wholly different thing.

My Protestant principles, such as they were, withheld me from visiting the convent which formed
a principal attraction to the military and other strangers in Kilkenny. Many sought to draw
me thither, adducing the examples of Christian ministers and other spiritual people, who did
not scruple to go; but in vain. At length a lady came to me with an earnest request from "the
most interesting nun in the establishment," to give her some information on the best mode of
conveying instruction to a poor little girl in their school, deaf and dumb. Here was a call
of duty: I knew it could not be effectually done unless in person; and to the surprise of my
friend, I volunteered to accompany her to the convent.

The nun was indeed a most engaging young lady; in personal appearance, in manner, in feeling,
realizing the visions of my girlish romance, when reading idle stories in novels on such topics.
She had, moreover, all the animated warmth of a genuine Irishwoman, and her fine countenance
beaming with benevolent joy at our successful beginning, and with affectionate gratitude for
my services, quite won my heart. I promised to repeat the visit shortly, and on doing so accompanied
her to walk round the garden, at the other extremity of which stood a building which I took
for their school, and unhesitatingly mounted the stairs with my sweet conductor. Judge what
was my dismay when, on passing the folding doors, I found myself in a splendid Popish chapel,
opposite the altar, over which shone a richly gilt cross, while my poor nun was prostrated
in the lowliest adoration, touching the ground with her forehead before the senseless idol.
I was confounded, and unable to say any thing; but after a hasty glance at the fine trappings,
left the place secretly praying for grace and strength to protest openly against the abomination
from which my soul revolted with unspeakable horror from the moment of my witnessing the act
of idolatrous homage rendered to a thing of wood and stone. On leaving the convent, I met a
person who informed me that my poor nun was a Protestant lady of high respectability, sprung
from one of those iniquitous mixed marriages, her mother belonging to the established church,
her father a Romanist, who, however, honestly adhered to the terms of the wicked covenant by
which the sons were to be educated in his, the daughters in her persuasion. A family of daughters
were born to them, who, with their mother, continued nominally Protestant; but after his death,
when the house was filled with Romish priests, performing for a week together their mummeries
over the corpse, these poor females had become a prey to the subtle perversions of the ecclesiastics,
and had openly apostatized, all save my new friend, who with a better informed mind and more
scriptural knowledge withstood their sophistries, until sundry mock miracles performed by means
of saintly relics and a well-contrived nocturnal visitation from the ghost of her father whom
she fondly loved, had so unnerved and frightened her that she too fell a prey to the delusion.
They ended by admitting her into the sisterhood of this convent, excusing the payment of the
large sum usually demanded; and as her darkness was now great in proportion to the measure
of light against which she had sinned, they found her a valuable decoy-bird to draw others
into the snare. I did not learn all these particulars at the time, nor until after her decease,
when I met with a near family connection of hers who told them to me. I simply gleaned the
fact of her apostasy, with that of her abounding zeal in the antichristian cause.

With all my heart I loved the gentle, affectionate, elegant nun, and earnestly did I pray for
help in bringing her back, as I was resolved to do, from the path of destruction; and while
I deliberated on the best means of commencing the work, the difficulty was removed by her openly
attempting to convert me. To this end she urged on me a strict inquiry into the real doctrines
and tenets of her church, for myself and by myself, promising to lend me books of the most
candid character, if I would engage to read them. I agreed, stipulating that I was freely to
write out my remarks on them for her consideration; and with this mutual understanding, I brought
home from the convent as a loan Dr. Milner's "End of Controversy," furnished for my especial
benefit by a seminary of Jesuit priests, located near the town: and thus was I become the object
of a combined attack from the forces of great Babylon.

True to what I considered a tacit engagement to study the matter alone, I read the book. Never
shall I forget the effect it produced on me. I seemed to be holding communion with Satan himself,
robed as an angel of light, the transparent drapery revealing his hideous form but baffling
my endeavors to rend it away. Such sophistry, such impudence of unsupported assertion, such
distortion of truth and gilding of gross falsehood, I never met with. I tried in vain to find
an answer to things that I saw and felt to be antiscriptural and destructive; but this "End"
was the beginning of my controversy, for I was wholly new to it, and ignorant of the historical
and other facts necessary to disprove the reverend author's bold assumptions. At last I burst
into tears, and kneeling down, exclaimed, "O Lord, I cannot unravel this web of iniquity: enable
me to cut it in twain." I was answered; for after a little more thought, a broad view of the
whole scheme of man's salvation as revealed in the holy Scriptures appeared to me the best
antidote for this insidious poison. I read through the New Testament with increased enjoyment,
and casting from me the wretched fabric of lies, with all its flimsy pretences, I resolved,
instead of attempting a reply to what I saw to be falsehood, to set forth a plain statement
of what I knew to be truth. Indeed it is indescribable how disgusting the painted face, the
gaudy trappings, and the arrogant assumptions of the great harlot appeared in my eyes, when
thus contrasted with the sublime simplicity, purity, and modesty of the chaste spouse of Christ.

I wrote; and in reply got another and a smaller book, containing the pretended reasons of a
Protestant for embracing Popery. They were of course artfully put, and made a formidable exhibition
of the peril of heresy. I thought I could not do better in return, while writing my dissent,
than to enclose some small books of my own to the nun, inviting her comments thereon. This
brought a letter which was probably written by stealth, though so cautiously worded as to be
safe if intercepted. She said she did not wish to leave me under a wrong impression, and therefore
told me that she was not permitted to read any of my letters, or the little books I had sent,
as those who watched over her spiritual interests and whom she was bound to obey, thought it
wrong to unsettle her mind by reading any thing contrary to the true faith which she held.
Here was a pretty exposure of one-sided honesty. I thanked God for the further insight given
me into the mystery of iniquity, and from that day devoted all my powers to the investigation
of that against which I had become a stanch protester.

In the midst of our proceedings, a nun had taken the veil at the convent. Every body almost,
to their shame be it spoken, was trying for tickets to the unhallowed show. My poor friend
sent us two, informed me that two of the best front seats would be reserved for us, and accompanied
her kind note with a programme of the ceremony and a translation or transcription of the service,
all in her own handwriting. I felt deeply the pain of hurting her, and perhaps for a moment
the workings of natural curiosity, but the hesitation was short. I sent back both books and
tickets, with a grateful but decided refusal to be present. In all Kilkenny I did not find
a person who could go along with me in my objections; but it is a matter of great joy to me
to this hour, that I kept myself wholly unpolluted by any participation in these idolatrous
doings; and I do believe that a double blessing has attended my efforts against Popery in consequence
of it.

The affair of the little deaf mute at the convent led me to turn my attention to some poor
children similarly circumstanced in the streets of Kilkenny; and while prosecuting that work
the Lord brought to me that dear dumb boy whom you well remember as the brightest, most lovely
of Christian characters. He was then very little, and had a brother of sixteen, one of the
most genuine paddies I ever beheld. This lad was living very idly; a fine, sensible, shrewd
fellow, who could read and write, and very soon made great proficiency in the finger language
by helping me to instruct Jack. No one above Pat's own rank had ever taken any interest in
him; I did, a strong one, and as he was much with me, and of a character most intensely Irish,
he became attached to my with a warmth of devotion rarely met with among any other people.

One day Pat made his appearance with an important look, his brogues stamping the carpet with
unwonted energy, his fine bare throat stiffened into a sort of dignified hauteur, and his very
keen hazel eyes sparkling under the bushy luxuriance of chestnut curls that clustered about
his face and fell on his neck. The very beau ideal of a wild Irish youth was my friend Pat.
Seating himself as usual, he began--and here I must observe that my chief knowledge of the
phraseology and turn of thought so peculiar to the Irish peasant was derived from this source.
Whenever Pat came "to discourse me," I got rich lessons in the very brogue itself, from the
fidelity with which his spelling followed the pronunciation of his words--"I wouldn't like,"
said he, "that you would go to hell."

"Nor I either, Pat."

"But you are out of the thrue church, and you wont be saved, and I must convart ye."

"That is very kind of you, my good lad. If I am wrong, you cannot do better than set me right."

"Sure and I will."

"But how?"

"With this," said he, pulling out a small pamphlet nothing the cleaner for wear. "You must
learn my catechism, and it's you that will be the good Catholic."

Delighted with the boy's honest zeal, I asked him where I should begin; and he no less pleased
at my docility, desired me to read it all, and then get it all by heart. I promised to do the
first at any rate; and Oh what a tissue of falsehood and blasphemy that "Butler's Catechism"
was. Next morning my teacher came early: "Well, Pat, I have found out what makes you anxious
about me: here it is said that none can be saved out of the true church."

"That's it, sure enough."

"But I do belong to the true church, and I'll show you what it is;" so I pointed out to him
two passages, and added, "Now, I do love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and therefore
I am one of those to whom St. Paul wishes grace and peace; and do you think an apostle would
send his blessing to any body who was not of the true church?"

Pat shook his head: "That's your catechism, not mine."

"Very true. Dr. Butler wrote yours, and God wrote mine," holding up the Bible; "which is best?"

"That is not the real Bible," persisted Pat; "my priest has the true Bible."

"Then ask him to lend you his."

"I wouldn't get my ears pulled, would I?" said he, smiling: "but if he lent me his Bible he
must lend me a car to bring it home in, for it's as big as this table. Yours is too little,
and doesn't hold half the truth. That is why you are so ignorant."

I soon proved, by showing him Matthew. Henry's Commentary, that the word of God would lie in
a very small compass, the great bulk of the book being man's work. I also urged on him the
absolute necessity of reading what God had given for our learning, and the danger of resting
on man's assertion.

Pat stood his ground most manfully, astonishing me by the adroitness with which he parried
my attacks, while pursuing, as he hoped, the good work of my conversion. For many a day was
the controversy carried on, Butler versus the Bible, without any other effect than that of
bringing Pat to read the sacred book for himself; but it opened to me the awful wiles of darkness
by which the poor and ignorant are blinded, while for the more educated class such polished
sophistry as Milner's is carefully prepared. I reaped the fruit, however, six years afterwards,
when, in a little English church, Pat kneeled beside me and his brother, a thankful communicant,
at the Lord's table.

LETTER VIII.

THE DUMB BOY.

I turned my attention to the deaf and dumb children, whose situation was deplorable indeed:
I took four out of the streets to instruct them, of whom one proved irreclaimably wild and
vicious; two were removed by a priest's order, lest I should infect them with heresy: the fourth
was to me a crown of rejoicing, and will be so yet more at "that day." * * *

John, or Jack as we always called him, was a puny little fellow, of heavy aspect, and wholly
destitute of the life and animation that generally characterize that class, who are obliged
to use looks and gestures as a substitute for words. He seemed for a long while unable to comprehend
my object in placing before him a dissected alphabet, and forming the letters into words significant
of dog, man, hat, and other short monosyllables; and when I guided his little hard hand to
trace corresponding characters on the slate, it was indeed a work of time and patience to make
him draw a single stroke correctly. His unmeaning grin of good-natured acquiescence in whatever
I bade him do, was more provoking than downright rebellion could have been; and I secretly
agreed with my friends that the attempt would prove a complete failure, while impelled, I hardly
could tell how, to persevere with redoubled efforts. Jack's uncouth bristly hair fell in a
straight mass over one of the finest foreheads ever seen, and concealed it. I happened one
day to put aside this mass, for the benefit of his sight, and was so struck with the nobly
expansive brow, that I exclaimed to a friend then in the act of dissuading me from the work,
"No; with such a forehead as this, I can never despair of success."

      *       *       *       *       *

It was by a sudden burst that the boy's mind broke its prison and looked around on every object
as though never before beheld. All seemed to appear in so new a light to him; curiosity, in
which he had been strangely deficient, became an eagerly active principle, and nothing that
was portable did he fail to bring to me, with an inquiring shake of the head, and the word
"what?" spelled by the fingers. It was no easy matter, before we had mastered a dozen common
substantives and no other parts of speech, to satisfy his inquisitiveness, which I always endeavored
to do, because it is wrong to repress that indication of dawning reason in a child, and Jack
at eleven years old was in the predicament of a mere infant. More especially was I puzzled
when his "what?" was accompanied by a motion pointing first at the dog, then to himself, to
learn wherein consisted the difference between two creatures, both of whom, as he intimated,
could eat, drink, sleep, and walk about, could be merry or angry, sick or well; neither of
whom could talk; and yet, that there was a very great difference, he felt. The noble nature
of man, was struggling to assert its preeminence over the irrational brute, which he, nevertheless,
loved and feared too; for Barrow was a splendid dog, and used to assist me very cleverly in
keeping my little wild Irish crew in order. Oh what a magnificent wreck is man! I do love to
watch the rapid approach of that glorious time when, the six thousand years of his degradation
beneath the reign of Satan being fulfilled, he shall rise above the usurper's power, and resume
his high station among the brightest works of God.

I do not remember exactly how long after his first coming to me it was that Jack began to inquire
so diligently about God. He seemed full of grave but restless thought, and then approaching
me, pointed towards the sun, and by a movement of the hands as if kneading something, asked
me whether I made it. I shook my head. Did my mother? No. Did Mr. Roe, or Mr. Shaw--two Protestant
clergymen--or the priest? He had a sign to express each of these. No. Then "What? what?" with
a frown and a stamp of fretful impatience. I pointed upwards, with a look of reverential solemnity,
and spelled the word "God." He seemed struck, and asked no more at that time, but next day
he overwhelmed me with "whats," and seemed determined to know more about it. I told him as
well as I could, that He of whom I spoke was great, powerful, and kind; and that he was always
looking at us. He smiled, and informed me he did not know how the sun was made, for he could
not keep his eyes on it; but the moon he thought was like a dumpling, and sent rolling over
the tops of the trees, as he sent a marble across the table. As for the stars, they were cut
out with a large pair of scissors, and stuck into the sky with the end of the thumb. Having
thus settled his system of astronomy, he looked very happy, and patted his chest with evident
self-applause.

I was amused, but of course not satisfied: my charge was necessarily an Atheist, and what I
had told him was a very bare sort of Deism indeed. To communicate more, however, seemed utterly
impossible, until we should have accomplished considerable things in the way of education.
We had not above a dozen of the commonest words--all names of things--to which he could attach
a meaning; and our signs were all of his own contriving, which I had to catch and follow as
I might. So said reason, but reason is a fool. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." "For my ways are not your ways, neither are
your thoughts my thoughts, saith the Lord." It pleased him to enlighten the mind of the boy;
and instead of that work being dependent on human wisdom, all that human wisdom could do was
to creep after it at a modest distance.

Next day, Jack came to me in great wrath, intimating that my tongue ought to be pulled out.
This was his usual mode of accusation where a lie had been told. So I looked innocent and said,
"What?" He reminded me of yesterday's conversation, telling me he had looked everywhere for
God: he had been down the street, over the bridge, into the churchyard, through the fields,
had peeped into the grounds of the castle, walked past the barrack-yard, and got up in the
night to look out at the window. All in vain; he could not find God. He saw nobody big enough
to put up his hand and stick the stars into the sky. I was "bad," my tongue must be pulled
out; for there was "God, NO." And he repeated "God, no," so often that it went to my heart.

I considered, prayerfully. My view of the scriptures told me that without divine help none
could really seek after God: and also that when he vouchsafed to give the desire, he would
surely increase knowledge. Here was a poor afflicted boy getting out of his bed to look by
night for one whom he had vainly sought all the day: here was Satan at work to strengthen unbelief:
I was commanded to resist the devil, and surely there must be some way of resisting him. I
sat silent on the opposite side of the fire, and a plan having struck me, I looked at Jack,
shrugged my shoulders and seemed convicted of a deception. He shook his head at me, frowned,
and appeared very much offended at my delinquency. Presently I seized a small pair of bellows,
and after puffing at the fire for a while, suddenly directed a rough blast at his little red
hand, which hung very near it. He snatched it back, scowled at me, and when again I repeated
the operation, expressed great displeasure, shivering, and letting me know he did not like it.

I renewed the puff, saying, "What?" and looking most unconscious of having done any thing;
he blew hard, and repeated that it made his hands cold; that I was very bad, and he was very
angry. Instruction; craftsman, animals, federates, them salvage compensation "something with boozing";

It was taken after consumption had set its seal on the countenance of that blessed young king,
as it did on that of my dear dumb boy.

In Dublin, he had one adventure that afforded him much enjoyment. I went into an extensive
toy-shop to make some purchase, and Jack, enchanted with the wonders around him, strolled to
the further end, and into a little adjoining recess, well filled with toys. A great uproar
in that direction made us all run to inquire the cause, and there was Jack, mounted on a first-rate
rocking-horse, tearing away full gallop, and absolutely roaring out in the maddest paroxysm
of delight, his hat fallen off, his arm raised, his eyes and mouth wide open, and the surrounding
valuables in imminent peril of a general crash. The mistress of the shop was so convulsed with
laughter that she could render no assistance, and it was with some difficulty I checked his
triumphant career, and dismounted him. He gave me afterwards a diverting account of his cautious
approach to the "good horse;" how he ascertained it was "bite, no; kick, no:" and gradually
got resolution to mount it. He wanted to know how far he had rode, and also if he was a God-made?
I told him it was wood, but I doubt whether he believed me. Thenceforth Dublin was associated
in his mind with nothing else; even at nineteen years of age he would say, if he met with the
name, "Good Dublin, good horse; small Jack love good Dublin horse." The shipping pleased him
greatly, and many of his beautiful drawings were representations of sailing vessels.

I had now been in Ireland five years and three months; and with what different feelings did
I prepare to leave its green shores from those with which I first pressed them. Unfounded prejudice
was succeeded by an attachment founded on close acquaintance with those among whom I had dwelt,
contempt by respect, and dislike by the warmest, most grateful affection. I had scorned her
poverty, and hated her turbulence. The first I now knew to be no poverty of soil, of natural
resources, of mind, talent, or energy, but the effect of a blight, permitted to rest alike
on the land and people, through the selfishness of an unjust, crooked policy, that made their
welfare of no account in its calculations, nor would stretch forth a hand to deliver them from
the dark dominion of Popery. Their turbulence was the natural fruit of such poverty, and of
their being wholly under the influence of a party necessarily hostile to the interests of a
Protestant state, and bent on subverting its ascendency. What Ireland was, I too plainly saw:
what she might be, I clearly understood; and the guilt of my country's responsibility lay heavy
on my heart as I watched the outline of her receding coast.

Bristol was our destination; and for the ensuing year, Clifton became our abode. This period
of my life was one of severe trial, which it is not necessary to particularize. Incipient derangement,
which afterwards became developed, in a quarter where, if I did not find comfort and protection,
I might expect their opposites, occasioned me much alarm and distress, while my brother's protracted
absence increased the trial. Much secluded, I pursued my literary avocations, and watched the
progress of Jack's growth in knowledge and in grace. * * *

My sojourn at Clifton brought me into personal acquaintance with that venerable servant of
God, Hannah More. We had for some time corresponded, and she had afforded me great encouragement
in my humble labors, taking an especial interest in my attempts to instruct the deaf and dumb
children. I had now the pleasure of showing her the progress made with Jack, who delighted
her greatly, and who, to the last day of his mortal existence, most fondly cherished the memory
of that sweet old lady. She was, indeed, one of the excellent of the earth, permitted long
to beautify the church which she had so mainly helped to strengthen and advance, and to be
an honor to the land where she had nobly stood forth to repel the assaults of revolutionizing
impiety. I often wonder that so little stress is laid upon this branch of Mrs. More's extensive
labors. We hear much of her schools, her charities, her letters, her devotional and educational
publications, and all of these deserve the full celebrity that they have attained. But England
should especially bear in mind her effective championship of the good cause, by means most
admirably adapted to its furtherance among the most dangerous, and generally speaking the most
unapproachable class--a class who congregated in ale-houses to hear the inflammatory harangues
of seditious traitors, while as yet Bibles were scarce, religious tracts not in existence,
and district visiting unthought of. In a lady of refined taste, and rare accomplishments in
the higher style of writing, to volunteer in a work so new, and to furnish the press with a
series of plain truths dressed in a most homely phrase, rendered attractive by lively narrative
and even drollery, and the whole brought down to the level of coarse, uninformed minds, while
circulated in a form to come within the narrow means of the lowest mechanics--this was an enterprise
worthy especial note, even had not God openly blessed it to the turning of that formidable
tide. When I looked upon the placid but animated countenance of the aged saint, as she sat
in her bow-window looking out upon the fair fields, the still inviolate shores of her beloved
country, I thought more of her "Cheap Repository Tracts" than of all her other works combined.
There lay the Bristol Channel, that noble inlet to our isle, by which the commerce of the world
was even then finding its peaceful way to the great mart of Bristol; and there sat the aged
lady, so long the presiding spirit of the place, with one hand, as it were, gathering the lambs
of the flock into green pastures among the distant hills, that formed a beautiful feature in
the landscape; with the other vigorously repulsing the wolf from the field. If I could have
discovered, which I could not, a single trait of consciousness that she was a distinguished
being, exalted into eminence by public acclaim, I must have conceived her to be dwelling upon
this branch of her many privileges, that she had been a Deborah where many a Barak shrunk from
the post of honor and skulked behind a woman. She took that lively interest in the public,
secular affairs of her country that Jeremiah and Ezekiel did of old; and on the same plain
ground--that where the state professes to be modelled and the executive to act on principles
of God's instilling, with a view that peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and
piety, may be established among us, nothing done by the state can be indifferent to the church,
or unworthy the anxious watchful regard of Christians. To be called a carnal politician by
those whose minds, at least on religious subjects, could contain, but one idea, was certainly
a light affliction to balance against the joyous consciousness of having materially aided in
preserving those cavillers' homes from the hand of the spoiler, and their Bibles from that
of the Atheist.

When I saw Hannah More, she was really at ease in her possessions; and none who loved her less
than the Lord himself did, would have laid a sorrow upon her grey hairs. Man would have decreed
that such a full-ripe shock of corn should be brought into the garner without further ruffling
or shaking. She had suffered exceedingly from rheumatism and other ailments, and yet more from
the tongue of calumny and the hand of ingratitude. She was an illustration of that striking
couplet,

  "Envy will merit as its shade pursue,
  And, like the shadow, prove the substance true."

She had, however, triumphed over all by meekly committing her cause to Him who judgeth righteously;
and now she seemed to be placed beyond the reach of further molestation, and about to end her
useful life in peace. But she had another lesson to give to the people of God, another fire
in which to glorify him: and not long after I saw her reclining in that lovely retreat which
had grown up about her, a perfect bower from slips and seeds of her own planting, as she delighted
to tell us, she was actually driven out of her little paradise, compelled to leave the shadow
of her nursling trees, and to cast a tearful farewell look on the smiling flowers, and to turn
away from the bright sea and the waving line of her Cheddar hills, to find a lodging in the
neighboring town; and all through treachery, domestic treachery against her whose whole life
had been a course of unsparing beneficence towards others. Hannah More perhaps needed to be
again reminded, that she must do all her works "as to the Lord," looking to him alone for acceptance
of them; or if she needed it not, others did; and often since she entered into her Saviour's
presence, "to go no more out," has the scene of the last trial to which her generous, confiding,
affectionate spirit was subjected, been blessed to the consolation of others. God's children
find that it is good for themselves that they should be afflicted; but they do not always remember
how good it is for the church, that they should be so. They look within, and seeing so much
there daily, "justly deserving God's wrath and condemnation," they lie still in his hand, willing
and thankful to have the dross purged out, and the tin taken away. Their fellows look on, and
not seeing the desperate wickedness of their hearts, but fondly believing them to be as near
perfection as human frailty will permit, they argue, "If such a saint as ---- be thus chastened
and corrected, what must a sinner like me expect?" So they learn watchfulness and fear in the
day of prosperity; and when adversity comes, they are enabled more lovingly to kiss the rod.
Oh, if we could see but a little of the Lord's dealings, in all their bearings, how should
we praise him for his goodness and the wonders that he doeth unto the children of men. What
profit, what pleasure has he in afflicting us? Surely it is, so to speak, more trouble to correct
than to leave us alone; and he would not twine the small cords into a scourge, unless to cleanse
and sanctify his temple.

I have said that my brother's return home was delayed. A hurt received in shooting, with its
consequences, detained him in Lisbon nearly a year; but his family came over, and I had a new
delicious employment, a solace under many sorrows, an unfailing source of interest and delight,
in teaching his eldest surviving boy the accomplishments of walking and talking. I almost expected
Jack to be jealous of such a rival, but I wronged him: nothing could exceed his fondness for
"baby boy," or the zeal of his Irish devotion to the little gentleman. Knowing that in the
event of my removal, Jack must earn his bread by some laborious or servile occupation, I had
kept him humble. He ate in the same room with us, because I never suffered him to associate
with servants; but at a side-table; and he was expected to do every little household work that
befitted his age and strength. A kind shake of the hand, morning and evening, was his peculiar
privilege; and the omission a punishment too severe to be inflicted, except on occasions of
most flagrant delinquency, such as rebelling against orders, or expressing any angry emotion,
to which he was constitutionally liable, by yells and howls that almost frightened our hosts
from their propriety. He had, of course, no idea of the strength of his own lungs, nor of the
effect produced by giving them full play in a fit of passion; but the commotion into which
it threw the whole house seemed to flatter his vanity, and he became a vocalist on very trifling
occasions. This neither agreed with our dear invalid landlady, nor was a fitting example for
"baby boy," who speedily tried his own little treble in admiring imitation of Jack's deafening
bass; and recourse was at last had to the aid of a young friend, who bestowed a few gentle
raps on his head with the bent end of a hooked cane, and then locked him up in a dark kitchen
for half an hour, saying to me, rather regretfully, "I suppose my popularity is at an end now.
Poor fellow, I shall be sorry to lose his affection." But this was so far from being the case,
that to his closing scene Jack retained a grateful remembrance of the proceeding. He used to
say, "Good Mr. W----; good little stick beat Jack's head; made bad Jack good. Jack love good
Mr. W----." At the very time, as soon as he saw his kind corrector after the business, he very
gracefully and cordially thanked him, kissing his hand, with a bow, and saying, "Jack no more
cry;" and as he really was hardly touched, and full well knew we had not the heart to be severe,
it was a proof of that openness to rebuke which is a lovely mark of true Christianity.

Montgomery beautifully says,

  "Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
  The Christian's native air."

And so it eminently was with the dumb boy. Under every form of condition and circumstance,
in health and sickness, in joy, in grief, in danger, in perplexity--over his food, his studies,
his work, his amusements, he was ever turning a look of peculiar sweetness on me, with the
two words, "Jack pray." He always smiled when so engaged, and a look of inexpressible eagerness,
mingled with satisfaction and the triumph of one who feels that he has taken a secure stand,
told me when he was praying, without any change of position, or looking up. There was always
a mixture of anxiety in his aspect when he tried to make himself understood by his fellow-creatures;
this gave place to something the reverse of anxiety when he was "talking to God," as he sometimes
expressed it. He oftener looked down than up; and very often did I see his eye fixed upon the
"baby boy," when, as his looks bespoke, and as he afterwards told me, he was "tell God" about
him, and that he was too little to know about Jesus Christ yet. Many a prayer of that grateful
dumb boy even now descends in blessings on the head of my brother's "baby," and long may the
hallowed stream continue to flow down, until they rejoice together before the throne of the Lamb.

One of Jack's lovely thoughts was this: he told me that when little children began to walk,
Jesus Christ held them by the hand to teach them; and that if they fell, he put his hand between
their heads and the ground to prevent their being hurt. Then, as if he saw this proceeding,
he would look up, and with the fondest expression say, "Good Jesus Christ, Jack very much loves
Jesus Christ." I hope you are not tired of Jack; I have much to tell about him. God made me
the humble means of plucking this precious brand from the burning; and I owe it to the Lord
to show what a tenfold blessing I reaped in it. Jack was not the only one of whom He has, in
the dispensations of his providence, said to me, "Nurse this child for me, and I will give
thee thy wages." I have found him a noble Paymaster.

And now I come to a period of my life that I have scarcely courage to go over. Many and sharp
and bitter were the trials left unrecorded here; and shame be to the hand that shall ever DARE
to lift the veil that tender charity would cast over what was God's doing, let the instruments
be what and who they might. It is enough to say, that even now I know there was not one superfluous
stroke of the rod, nor one drop of bitter that could have been spared from the wholesome cup.
Besides, he dealt most mercifully with me; those two rich blessings, health and cheerfulness,
were never withdrawn. I had not a day's illness through years of tribulation; and though my
spirits would now and then fail, it was but a momentary depression; light and buoyant, they
soon danced on the crest of the wave that had for an instant ingulfed them.

It is of joy I have to tell: safety, peace, prosperity, under the restored sunshine that had
made my early career so bright. Never did a sister more fondly love a brother; never was a
brother more formed to be the delight, the pride, the blessing of a sister. He was of most
rare beauty from the cradle, increasing in loveliness as he grew up, and becoming the very
model of a splendid man; very tall, large, commanding, with a face of perfect beauty, glowing,
animated, mirthful--a gait so essentially military, that it was once remarked by an officer,
"If B---- were disguised as a washerwoman, any soldier would give him the salute." He had also
served in the Peninsula with the highest possible credit, regarded by those in command as one
of the best officers in the service, and most ardently loved by the men under him. Many a bloody
battle-field had he seen; but never did a wound reach him. On one occasion--at Albuhera--his
gallant regiment went into action 800 strong, and on the following day only 96 men were able
to draw rations. He became on the field a lieutenant, from being the youngest ensign; and alike
in all circumstances he shone out as an honor to his profession. He had also been an especial
favorite with John VI. of Portugal, and the high polish of a court was superadded to all the
rest, without in the smallest degree changing the exceedingly playful, unaffected joyousness
of the most sunshiny character I ever met with.

Ten years' absence had produced the effect on my sisterly love that Burns describes:

  "Time but th' impression stronger makes,
  As streams their channels deeper wear."

I had also many personal reasons for looking forward to his return with peculiar anxiety; and
its uncertainty increased the feeling. I had been spending the day with a sick friend, and
ran home at night to the lodging occupied by my mother and myself, and there I found my brother.
What a dream those ten years' trials appeared!

We remained but a short time in Clifton, and soon bent our way towards the metropolis, where
he expected, as is usual, to dance a long and wearisome attendance on the Horse Guards, for
a regimental appointment. He had refused that of aid-de-camp to king John, with any military
rank and title that he might desire; preferring a half-pay unattached company in the British,
to any thing that a foreign service could offer; but he was mistaken: his merits were well
known to the Duke of York, and before he could well state to Sir Herbert Taylor his wishes,
that estimable man told him he had only to select out of two or three regiments lately returned
from foreign service, and he would be gazetted on the following Tuesday. He chose the 75th,
and was immediately appointed to it, with leave to study for two years in the senior department
of the Military college at Sandhurst, the better to qualify himself for a future staff situation.

A sweet cottage, standing isolated on the verge of Bagshot-heath, sheltered by tall trees and
opening on a beautiful lawn, with a distant but full view of the college, became our abode.
A delightful room was selected for me, with an injunction to sit down and make the most of
my time while he was in the halls of study, that I might be at leisure to walk, to ride, to
garden, to farm with him--my brother--my restored brother, whose eye beamed protection, and
whose smile diffused gladness, and whose society was what in our happy childhood it had ever
been, just instead of all the world to me. If one thing was wanting, and wanting it was, to
knit us in a tie more enduring than any of this world's bonds could possibly be, that very
sense of want furnished a stimulus to more importunate prayer on his behalf. Some of the good
people who for lack of a relay of ideas borrow one of their neighbors and ride it to death,
treated me to a leaf from the book of Job's comforters, when the calamity fell on me of that
precious brother's death, by telling me I had made an idol of him. It was equally false and
foolish. An idol is something that either usurps God's place, or withdraws our thoughts and
devotions from him. The very reverse of this was my case. I had an additional motive for continually
seeking the Lord, not only in prayer for the enlightening influences of the Holy Spirit on
behalf of one so dear, but also for grace to walk most circumspectly myself, lest I should
cast any stumbling-block in his way, or give him occasion to suspect that my religious profession
was a name, and not a reality. That was surely a profitable idol which kept me always prayerful
before God, watchful over myself, diligent in the discharge of duties, and in continual thanksgiving
for the mercies I had received. Do I repent loving my brother so well? I wish it had been possible
to love him better. These warm affections of the heart are among the sweetest relics of a lost
Eden, and I would sooner tear up the flowers that God has left to smile in our daily path through
a sin-blighted wilderness, far sooner than I would cease to cherish, to foster, to delight
in the brighter, sweeter flowers of domestic love, carried to the full extent of all its endearing
capabilities.

The Lord knoweth our frame; he deals with us not according to what we are not, but according
to what we are. He sets before us various duties, and to the end that we may the better fulfil
them, he gives us aids not contrary to, but accordant with our natural feelings. Men set up
a standard, often a just and scriptural one, to which they sorrowfully confess that because
of the weakness of their nature they cannot themselves attain; but according to which they
sternly judge their neighbors. A person has a path assigned to him, a steep ascent strewed
with thorns and crowded with obstacles, before which he often pauses and waxes faint. God gives
him a companion for his way, even as he sent forth the disciples two and two, and the pilgrim
is cheered. He quickens his pace; another besides himself will be benefited by his progress,
and if he fails, another will suffer in his loss. So he goes on thankful, rejoicing, and endued
with double energy for the toilsome achievement. But he sees a neighbor to whom the Lord has
also granted help through human means, perhaps not exactly similar to that which he has received;
he sees his neighbor likewise openly rejoicing in the possession of such a staff; and bringing
him to the tests of that perfect law which requires an entire devotedness to and dependence
on the Lord, he raises a cry of "mixed motives," "the arm of flesh," "idolatry," and so forth.
No doubt he is so far right, that perverse humanity will ever abuse God's gifts, and often
make them occasions of sin; but this outcry of the beam against the mote, which is so grievously
prevalent in the religious world, is very unseemly. Oh, how infinitely more tender is the Lord
to us than we to one another.

Hitherto, many impediments had been thrown in the way of my literary labors. Anxiety, apprehension,
and the restlessness of feeling resulting from a continual change of abode, had broken the
train of thought, and rendered my work very uncertain. Indeed, it would often have been wholly
inadequate to my support, but for the watchful kindness of friends whom the Lord raised up
to me, foremost among whom always stood the estimable Mr. Sandford, who never ceased to regard
me with paternal affection and care. To he wholly independent was the first earthly wish of
my heart; and now a fair opportunity was given of testing my willingness to labor diligently.
The result was so far, satisfactory, that in the course of the two years and two months of
my residence under my brother's roof, I wrote the Rockite, the System, Izram, Consistency,
Perseverance, Allen McLeod, Zadoc, and upwards of thirty little books and tracts, besides contributions
to various periodicals. I was going on most prosperously, when an attempt was suddenly made
from another quarter to establish a claim to the profits of my pen. The demand was probably
legal, according to the strict letter of existing statutes, though circumstances would have
weighed strongly in my favor. But it greatly reduced the value of my copyrights for the time
being, and I found myself checked in my career at a juncture when it was especially my desire
to go on steadily. This brought upon me two temptations, the force of which was greatly increased
by the circumstances under which they found me.

LETTER X.

SANDHURST.

When I first began to write, it was with a simple desire to instruct the poor in the blessed
truths of the gospel. My own situation soon rendered it needful to turn the little talent I
possessed to account. This I did, still keeping in view the grand object of promoting God's
glory; and my attempts having been well received, I found a ready market for whatever I wrote,
so that the name was considered a sufficient guarantee for the book. Now, I could no longer
safely use that name, and anonymous writing became the only feasible plan. A friend, who did
not look upon the main subject in the light that I did, made, through my brother, a proposal
that I should become a contributor to the most popular magazine of the day, supplying tales,
etc., the purport of which was to be as moral as I pleased, but with no direct mention of religion.
The terms offered were very high: the strict incognito to be preserved would secure me from
any charge of inconsistency, and coming as it did when my regular source of income was suddenly
closed, and when the idea of being burdensome to my generous brother with his increasing family
was hardly supportable, it was thought I could not demur.

Nevertheless, I did; the Lord in his gracious providence had said to me, "Go work to-day In
my vineyard," and I had for upwards of four years enjoyed that blessed privilege. It was now
withdrawn, certainly not without his permission; and how did I know that it was not to try
my faith? The idea of hiring myself out to another master--to engage in the service of that
world the friendship of which is enmity with God--to cause the Holy One of Israel to cease
from before those whom by the pen I addressed--to refrain from setting forth Jesus Christ and
him crucified to a perishing world, and give the reins to an imagination ever prone to wander
after folly and romance, but now subdued to a better rule--all this was so contrary to my views
of Christian principle, that, after much earnest prayer to God, I decided rather to work gratuitously
in the good cause, trusting to Him who knew all my necessity, than to entangle myself with
things on which I could not ask a blessing. My concentration. delaware lory has been even reduce...

 In fact, I had been too much in the trammels of a system which lays down
arbitrary rules, and will not admit that God is working unless his hand be immediately and
openly apparent to all. I would not believe that what looked green and beautiful was a blade
of corn, just because it had not yet grown to an ear: and I refrained from speaking when perhaps
speech on such subjects would have been more welcome than he wished to acknowledge, lest the
remarks that I longed to utter might prove unpalatable, and produce the contrary effect to
what I desired. He was only going for a little while: an appointment on the home-staff was
promised, and then I was to live with him again, and I would zealously pursue the work. Alas,
what a rod was prepared for my unbelief and presumption! The present was slighted, in the confident
expectation of a future that was never to arrive.

We were almost always together out of his college hours. My window commanded a view of the
distant building, and when I saw the preparatory movement to breaking up, I rose from my desk,
tied on my bonnet, and ran off in sufficient time to meet him very near the college. Both let
loose from six hours' hard work, we were like children out of school, often racing and laughing
with all the buoyancy of our natural high spirits. The garden, the poultry-yard, and all the
little minutiae of our nice farming establishment, fully occupied the afternoon, while the
children gambolled round, and Jack looked on with smiles, often telling me how much he loved
"beautiful Captain B----," as he constantly called him. At ten o'clock we parted for the night,
I to resume the pen till long after midnight; he to rest, whence he always rose at four o'clock,
devoting four or five hours to study before we met in the morning. We visited very little,
domestic retirement being the free choice of every one of us; and nothing could have induced
my brother to banish his children from the parlor or drawing-room. Few things excited his indignation
more than the nursery system: his little ones were the pride of his heart, the delight of his
eyes, the objects of his fondest care. He often said he intended his boys to be gentlemen,
and therefore would not allow them to imbibe the tastes and habits of the kitchen. The consequence
is that his boys are gentlemen.

Thus dwelling in love, united in every plan and pursuit, our time fairly divided between diligent
work and healthful recreation amid the delights of rural life, do you marvel that I call this
period my two shortest years? Had no previous circumstances given tenfold brilliancy to these
lights by casting a depth of black shadow behind them, or no menacing future hung over the
present enjoyment, still there was enough to make it indeed an oasis; but it was more. I cannot
doubt that the Lord mercifully gave me a foreboding of what was to come, in the intolerable
anguish of what seemed to be but a very short parting, with a delightful prospect of renewed
domestic comfort just beyond. Yet so it was: I almost died under the trial of that farewell;
and for three weeks before, and as long after, I never had a night's rest. Visions of terror
were constantly before me, among which a scene of drowning was so perpetually recurring that
I have often started from my bed under the vivid impression. This was the more strange because
we had always been so fearlessly fond of the water: in our early days we had a little boat,
just big enough for him to row and me to steer, in which we used to take excursions on the
river Wensum, and never thought of danger. At Sandhurst too we were frequently upon the lake,
and had both become familiarized with ocean, until of all perils those of the water were least
likely to daunt me, either for myself or him: yet in most imminent peril we had once been placed;
and at this time it would recur to my memory with tormenting frequency.

I was about seven years old, and he though younger was much the larger of the two, a stout
hearty boy, and I a very frail delicate little creature, thanks to the doctors and their pet
drug. Our parents went out for a day's excursion with a friend, and of course we accompanied
them. The place was one celebrated for good fishing, and the gentlemen having enjoyed a long
morning's sport, remained in the house with my mother, sending us out to play. We had strict
charge not to go too near the water, nor on any account to get into a boat, of which there
were several on the river. We strolled about, and at last came to the brink of this river,
to admire a barge or wherry which lay close to the little pier; for it was a public ferry,
and the depth very great. A small boat just by attracted my brother's attention, who wished
to get into it, until I reminded him of the prohibition, when he said, "I wont get into it,
Char., but I will sit down here and put my two feet in the little boat." He did so: the boat
moved, and in his alarm trying to rise, he fell and disappeared.

I perfectly remember the scene; I have also heard it described many a time by others, but I
cannot understand how it was that I, stooping from the shore, with nothing to hold on by way
of support, seized the little fellow by the collar as he rose, and firmly held him in my grasp.
He did not struggle, but looked up in my face, and I down in his, and as I felt my puny strength
rapidly failing, the resolution was firm on my mind to be drawn in and perish with him. There
was not a question about it; I can recall the very thought, as though it was of yesterday,
and I am positively certain that I should have tightened my hold in proportion as the case
became more desperate. It pleased God that, just then, some men returning from work descried
the figure of a little child stooping in a most dangerous position over the deep water: they
ran up, and while one held me the other rescued the boy. My grasp was not unloosed until they
had him safe on shore: he was then insensible, and I lost every recollection until I found
myself still in the arms of the man who had carried me in, while my mother and the rest were
stripping the rescued boy and chafing his limbs before a fire. It was much talked of, and many
a caress I got for what they considered heroism beyond my years; but what heroism is like love?

When my brother departed for Ireland, we left that sweet cottage and went to reside in the
village, in one better suited to the size of our diminished family party. I had several young
friends among the cadets, in whom I took a warm interest, and whose occasional visits I endeavored
to make as profitable to them as might be. It is a sad thing to see a boy, perhaps most carefully
brought up by tender, and even Christian parents, watched and kept as far as possible from
all evil communication, then thrown at once into a large public institution, and exposed to
every danger that can assail the youthful mind. A little insight into human nature must show
any candid person the extent of mischief to be expected. Rarely do we find a case of conversion,
with establishment in grace, very early in life; and where it exists as remarkably as in Jack,
we may learn from his excessive dread of exposure to temptation how vigilantly the young plant
should be guarded. Let us just suppose, what is indeed no sketch of imagination, but a slight
sketch of acknowledged reality--let us suppose a boy at the age when they are eligible for
those places, acquainted with the truth, accustomed to Christian instruction, taught to look
into the word of God for daily direction, and to seek in prayer the daily supply of needful
grace: consider him as having remained under the eye of Christian parents, or a schoolmaster
who regards those committed to his care as immortal beings, for whose well-doing while under
his charge he is responsible to God, and who therefore counsels them well, and banishes to
the utmost of his power, vice and profaneness from among them; affording them the usual domestic
means of grace, and seeing that they are not neglected:--thus prepared, the lad enters upon
a new scene, where he finds himself surrounded by a large number of youthful companions, all
busy in qualifying themselves for a future career, we will say in the service of their country.
The first thing done is to try the mettle of the new comer by putting upon him some insult,
which if he resents and offers to fight his way, he may be looked on with some respect; but
if he appear timid, or reluctant to retaliate, he may be assured of becoming the object of
a most harassing persecution for the amusement of the thoughtless and the gratification of
the cruel. In either case, he passes an ordeal of great severity, particularly during the night,
when nothing is deemed too rough or alarming for the poor stranger to encounter. I appeal to
those who have passed it, whether this is not enough to turn the brain of a weak-minded youth,
or to injure severely the body of a delicate one: I have myself known an instance, in a great
public seminary, wherein derangement and death followed.

Supposing this well got over, the lad then finds that if there be any among his new comrades
disposed to keep up the practice of reading the Scriptures and praying, they must do it as
secretly as they would commit a murder, and find it more difficult to accomplish than any crime
that could be named. There always will be a large proportion of ruffianly characters among
many boys; some naturally so, others made so by example. These have the ascendency of course,
and they will use it to check and to stifle whatever might shine in contrast to themselves;
while, what with those unstable characters who always row with the stream, and prudent ones
who will not provoke hostility, and timid ones who dare not, they meet with little if any opposition,
but rule the whole mass for evil. The youth, we will believe, sincerely desires to preserve
his integrity; but what can he do? Man in his best estate is a frail, inconsistent being, liable
to be blown about by every breath of temptation, even when unfettered, and in full possession
of all gospel privileges; and what are we to expect from a boy who has never yet been left
to himself, or deprived of countenance and support? He sees none watching over him, he hears
no kind admonitory voice inviting him to seek the way of peace and purity. His nature is corrupt,
his heart is deceitful, his soul cleaves to the dust, and he finds that by following the bent
of this perverse nature, by gratifying its lowest propensities, and revelling in unhallowed
things, he shall best purchase the good- fellowship of those who have it in their power to
make his life miserable if he thwarts their will. His conscience loudly protests, and calls
on him to pray; but if he would do so, where is he to retire for that purpose? Alone he cannot
be; he has no separate apartment, and let those who have tried it say what would be the consequence
of his kneeling down publicly to worship God. He may do it silently and undiscovered in his
bed; yes, if he can lift up his heart, and realize the presence of the God of heaven, while
the language of hell resounds on every side. Even so, he has an enemy within, striving against
the right principle, and responding to all that his better feeling repudiates. Then, too, wherewithal
shall the young man cleanse his way, if not by ruling himself according to the word of God?
And how is he to study that word? Does the parent who puts a Bible in his boy's portmanteau
know that the most blasphemous tissue of ribaldry and all abomination, would be a more suitable
gift, if it is intended that he should exhibit it? These are awful questions, to be well considered
by those who are wavering as to the destination of a youth; and they apply very widely throughout
the land.

We all know the case of him whose heart has been swept and garnished; and how much the last
state is worse than the first, when Satan reenters with his seven new companions. The very
checks of conscience render the fretted mind more restive; and the longer restrained, the more
headlong is the wild gallop into which the chafed spirit at last breaks. He who trembled at
a profane word, becomes an accomplished swearer; he whose modesty was most retiring is foremost
to glory in early depravity; he whose hand was ever ready to relieve the poor, while his heart
sympathized in their sorrows, becomes the wanton spoiler and marauder for the sake of a bold
vaunt; he who shrunk from the approach of profligate misleaders, now volunteers to harden new
comers in the ways of sin. The youth who with noiseless step trod the courts of the Lord's
house, and bent with lowly reverence in prayer, and listened with fixed attention to the teacher's
voice, now delights in shaming others out of the semblance of devotion, and feigns, if he does
not fall into it, the profound sleep of a wholly uninterested actor in the tedious show of
public worship. Perchance some friend whose proximity to the place admits of it may stretch
out a helping hand, or lift an admonitory voice, or proffer a little encouragement to strengthen
the things that remain, and which are ready to die: if so, both the helper and the helped will
be marked out for ridicule and reviling, if for nothing worse.

Honorable men, after this world's course, who are themselves wholly in the dark, verily believing
that religion would turn a youth's brain and unfit him for the active business of life, will
feel it a part of their duty to oppose every possible obstacle to such attempts at reclaiming
the young wanderers under their charge. I knew, and knew right well, an instance wherein a
lady who strove to do good to the souls of some young lads whose parents she knew to be praying
people, had a sort of ban put upon her, by the publication of an express order that they should
not be again permitted to visit her; and when a nobleman who well knew that she had not done
any thing to merit such public condemnation, asked the principal of the institution the reason
for so harsh a proceeding, he received this answer: "My lord, I was sorry to do it; I felt
it a painful duty, but an imperative one. The fact is, she got hold of some of the most promising
lads under my care, and so infected them with her own gloomy notions that, I give you my word,
they were seen walking alone, with Bibles in their hands." So much wiser are the children of
this world in guarding those committed to them from the entrance of spiritual good, than are
the children of light in protecting their dearest treasures from the contamination of most
deadly evil.

But to return to my cadets at Sandhurst. I had two young friends there, both Irish, who were
known to me from childhood; both greatly attached to my brother; both loving me dearly; and
many a happy hour we passed, strolling over the wild heath, or enjoying the cheerfulness of
my cottage home. On those two, among many, I looked with especial solicitude as to their future
course; and I have had to rejoice, in different ways, over them both. One was early taken to
his rest; he died in the faith, looking simply to the Lord Jesus, and finding perfect peace
in him. The other was long away on foreign service, and when next I saw him it was as the deliverer,
under God, of a whole town, and probably through that of the whole kingdom, from a scene of
revolutionary carnage. He commanded the gallant little body of troops at Newport who, on the
4th of November, 1839, quelled the Chartist insurrection, and broke the formidable power that
menaced a general outbreak. I cannot pass over this event, it was so delightfully gratifying to me.

A third of those in whom I took a lively interest was Alexander Count Calharez, the eldest
son of the Duc de Palmella. He was a most elegant youth, of fine mind, delicate feelings, and
the sweetest manners possible. Devotedly attached to Romanism, he constantly attended mass
at the house of the old abbe, who added to his professorship in the Royal Military College
the duties of a Popish priest. It was a sore grief to me to see Calharez pursuing his solitary
way to that house, while we took the road to the college chapel, and met him half-way. I longed
to enter a solemn protest against his delusion, but I never did it in direct terms, though
very often dwelling, in his presence, on the peculiar truths of Christianity, opposed as they
are to the lie in which he trusted. I hoped to have enjoyed many future opportunities of conversing
with him, for he always sought our society in preference to many things that appeared more
attractive, and took a lively interest in Jack. But the college did not suit his taste; he
left it soon and accompanied his father to Portugal. He died at the Azores; and I have been
told that his hope at the last was one which maketh not ashamed. He was the subject of many
prayers; the last day will tell whether they were answered.

But I cannot hasten through the heaviest part of my task; it is the rending open of a wound
never to heal until the leaves of the tree of life shall be laid upon it; and if by any means
I do attain to that resurrection from among the dead in which none but the Lord's children
shall partake, surely the dear object of all this sorrow will be there beside me.

Six months had passed since my brother's departure to Ireland, and all his letters were full
of cheerfulness and pleasant anticipation. On the subject where I most wished to know his feelings,
he was silent; but a passage in one of his letters struck me greatly. I had been suffering
from a slight local pain, which one of my medical friends erroneously pronounced to be a disease
of the heart; and in communicating this to him I had noticed, that I must live in momentary
expectation of sudden death. His reply was very affectionate. He said it had given him a great
shock, but on a little reflection he was convinced of its being altogether a nervous sensation;
adding, "If not, why should you shrink from sudden death? For my own part, I should desire
it, as a short and easy passage out of this life." A tremor came over me as I read these words;
but again I thought, "Surely there is something on his mind to brighten that passage, or he
would not so express himself;" and the thought of many perils surrounding him quickened me
to redoubled prayer that God would set his feet upon the Rock of ages.

It was on a bright Sabbath morning at the end of June, that having rather overslept myself,
I found, on awaking, the letters brought by early post lying on my pillow. I took one: it was
the Horse Guards envelope, in which his letters usually came; and in my eagerness to open one
from him, I did not even put up a prayer. Full of smiling anticipation, I unfolded the enclosure,
which was from a most dear and valued friend at the Horse Guards; and after some tender preparation,
which the sudden reeling of my terrified brain prevented my comprehending, came the paralyzing
sequel: A letter had been received from Mullingar--he was on the lake fishing--the boat overset.
I could not understand the meaning of the words; but I understood the thing itself.

I sprung to my knees to cry for mercy on him--but Oh, that dreadful, dreadful thought that
pierced through my inmost soul--"He is beyond the reach of prayer." I fell back as if really
shot. But what avails it to dwell on this? I bore it as God enabled me; I felt crushed, annihilated
as it were, under the fierce wrath of the Lord; for to aggravate the blow, I had no power to
believe or to hope. It was a light thing to have lost him, my all in this cold, dreary world,
who from early infancy had been as the light to my eyes, and the life-blood to my heart--him
who had so very lately been restored, as if to show that while he remained all I could desire
of earthly happiness was within my reach--him who had been to me instead of every other mortal
blessing, and to whom I looked for all that I dared hope of future comfort. It was a light
thing to have lost him, and to look upon the anguish of his widowed mother, to whom he had
ever been more of a ministering angel than a son, and upon the tears of his little daughter,
who had lost a father indeed. All this was a small matter compared with the overwhelming horrors
of that fearful thought, that he had lost his soul.

I had fallen much into the common, dangerous error of looking to my own faith rather than to
the object of it for salvation; and I did in my heart, exceedingly glory in this supposed faith
of mine. The dreadful dispensation under which I was laid showed me at once, that of faith
I had not to the value of a grain of mustard-seed; and now I felt the desolation of spirit
which none can know who have not been so compelled to make such a discovery. I did not rebel;
I owned the justice of God: nay, the very first words I could find breath to utter broke forth
in the confession, "Righteous art thou, O Lord; just and true are thy ways, O King of saints!"
But it was a fearful trembling beneath the hand that had smote me; and as for being contented
to have it so, I was not: I do not wish that I had been contented to believe my brother was
lost; I do not understand that feeling, nor wish to understand it; for surely while we remain
in the flesh, we cannot divest ourselves of what God has interwoven with our very nature, nor
cease to feel for the spiritual, the eternal interests of those most fondly endeared to us--a
solicitude as great, aye, much greater, than what we, in our unconverted state, once knew in
regard to their temporal concerns. I speak of those instances where, after being ourselves
brought to know the Lord, we have labored and prayed perseveringly for others, and then have
suddenly lost them. I was not content to think that my prayers had been cast out: I wanted
some token that they had been answered. Blessed be the God of all mercies, I was not disappointed.
* * *

Meanwhile, what a tenfold recompense for all the care bestowed on him did I reap in the beautiful
sympathy of the dumb boy. When I came down stairs that dreadful morning, he met me with a face
of such wild dismay as even then arrested my attention. He uttered an audible "Oh!" of most
touching tone, and thus expressed the impossibility he felt of realizing the tidings: "Jack
what? Jack asleep? Jack see, no--think, no. Jack afraid, very. Beautiful Captain B---- gone?--dead?
What?" and he stamped with the impatience of that fearfully inquisitive what. I answered, "Captain
B---- gone; water kill--dead." Tears stole down his loving face as he responded, "Poor mam!
Mam one;" meaning I was now alone in the world. "God see poor mam one; Jesus Christ love poor
mam one." With a feeling of bitter agony I asked him, "What? Jesus Christ love Captain B----?"
"Yes," he replied, after a moment's solemn thought on the question, "Yes, Jack much pray; mam
much pray; Jesus Christ see much prays." This was true comfort; all the eloquence of all the
pulpits in England could not have gone to my heart like that assurance, that Jesus Christ had
seen his many dumb prayers on behalf of that lost--Oh, I could not, even in the depth of my
unbelieving heart, say, "lost one." I again asked the boy, "Jack much prays?" He answered with
solemn fervency, "Very, very much prays. Jack pray morning, pray night; Jack pray church, pray
bed. Yes, Jack many days, very, pray God make"--and he finished by signs, that wings should
be made to grow from my brother's shoulders, for him to fly to heaven, adding, Jesus Christ
must make the wings; and then, with a burst of delighted animation, he told me that he was
a "very tall angel, very beautiful."

I have repeated this conversation to show the broken language carried on between us; and also
how powerfully he expressed his thoughts. Soon after, when I was nearly fainting, a glass of
water was held to my lips. I am ashamed to say, I dashed it down, exclaiming, "That murderer!"
Jack caught my eye, and echoing my feelings, said, in a bitter way, "Bad water!" then with
a look of exulting contempt at the remaining fluid, he added, "Soul gone water? No!" This idea,
that the soul was not drowned, electrified me; so good is a word spoken in due season, however
trite a truism that word may be.

That night I pretended to go to bed, that others might do so too; and then I left my room,
went to my little study, which was hung round with Jack's sweet drawings, and sat down, resting
my elbows on the table, my face on my hands, and so remained for a couple of hours. Day had
scarcely broken, brightly upon me, about two in the morning, when the door opened softly, and
Jack entered, only partially dressed, his face deadly pale, and altogether looking most piteously
wretched. He paused at the door, saying, "Jack sleep, no; Jack sick, head bad--no more see
beautiful Captain B----." I could only shake my head, and soon buried my face in my hands again.
However, I still saw him through my fingers; and after lifting up his clasped hands and eyes
in prayer for me, he proceeded to execute the purpose of his visit to that room. Softly, stealthily,
he went round, mounting a chair, and unpinned from the wall every drawing that contained a
ship, a boat, or water under any form of representation. Still peeping at me, hoping he was
not observed, he completed this work, which nothing but a mind refined to the highest degree
of delicate tenderness could ever have prompted, and then stopping at the door, cast over his
shoulder such a look of desolate sorrow at me, that its very wretchedness poured balm into
my heart. Oh what a heavenly lesson is that, "Weep with them that do weep," and how we fly
in its face when going to the mourner with our inhuman, cold- blooded exhortations to leave
off grieving. Even Job's tormenting friends gave him seven days' true consolation while they
sat silent on the earth weeping with him.

But God put into the dumb boy's heart another mode of consolation, which I must recount as
a specimen of his exceedingly original and beautiful train of thought. He used to tell his
ideas to me as if they were things that he had seen: and now he had a tale to relate, the day
after this, which riveted my attention. He told me my brother went on the lake in a little
boat, and while he was going along the devil got under it, seized one side, pulled it over,
and caught my brother, drawing him down to the bottom, which, as he told me, was deep, deep,
and flames under it. Then Jesus Christ put his arm out of a cloud, reached into the water,
took the soul out of the body, and drew it into the sky. When the devil saw the soul had escaped,
he let the body go, and dived away, crying, Jack said, with rage, while the men took it to
land. The soul, he continued, went up, up, up; it was bright, and brighter, "like sun--all
light, beautiful light." At last he saw a gate, and inside many angels looking out at him;
but two very small angels came running to meet the soul; and when he saw them, he took them
up into his arms, kissed them, and carried them on towards the gate, still kissing and caressing
them. I was amazed and utterly at a loss, and said, "Two angels? What? Mam not know; what?"
He looked at me with a laugh of wonder; pointed to my head and the wooden table, and replied--his
usual way of calling me stupid-- "Doll mam! Two small boys, dead, Portugal." My brother had
lost two babes in Portugal; and thus exquisitely, thus in all the beauty of true sublimity,
had the untaught deaf and dumb boy pictured the welcome they had given their father on approaching
the gate of heaven.

A day or two after, some kind, sympathizing relations and friends being assembled at the dinner-table,
something cheerful was said, which excited a general smile: Jack was in the act of handing
a plate; he looked round him with a face of stern indignation, set down the plate, said, "Bad
laughing!" and walked out of the room, stopping at the door to add to me, "Mam, come: no laughing!
Gone; dead." I had not smiled; and this jealous tenaciousness of such a grief, on the part
of an exceedingly cheerful boy, was the means of soothing more than any other means could have
done it, the anguish of that wound which had pierced my very heart's core. These were a small
part of the munificent wages that my Master gave me for nursing a child of his.

My first act had, of course, been to adopt my brother's son--the "baby boy"--now five years
old, who had been since he first showed his little round face in England, my own peculiar treasure.
I begged him as a precious boon, and for his sake bore up against the storm of sorrow that
was rending me within. Jack fell into a decline, through the depression of his spirits in seeing
me suffer; for to conceal it from one who read every turn of my countenance was impossible;
and I should have been well content to sink also, but for the powerful motive set before me.
Under God, who gave him to me, you may thank your young friend for what little service I may
have rendered in the cause you love, since 1828; for the prospect which by the Lord's rich
mercy is so far realized, of seeing him grow up a useful, honorable member of society, with
right principles, grounded on a scriptural education, was what enabled me to persevere against
every difficulty and every discouragement that could cross my path. I set up a joyful Ebenezer
here; and I ask your prayers that the blessing may be prolonged, increased, perfected, even
to the day when we shall all meet before the throne of God. * * *

LETTER XII.

EMPLOYMENT.

How is it that Christians so often complain they can find nothing to do for their Master? To
hear some of them bemoaning their unprofitableness, we might conclude that the harvest indeed
is small, and the laborers many. So many servants out of employ is a bad sign; and to obviate
the difficulty complained of, I purpose showing you two or three ways in which those who are
so inclined may bestir themselves for the good of others. What a blessing were a working church!
and by a church I mean, "the company of all faithful people," whosoever and wheresoever they be.

In the village where I lived, there was a very good national-school, well attended; also a
Sunday-school; and the poorer inhabitants generally were of a respectable class, with many
of a higher grade, such as small tradesmen, and the families of those in subordinate offices
about the Military College. I always took a great interest in the young; and as love usually
produces love, there was no lack of affectionate feeling on their part. It occurred to me,
as the Sunday was much devoted by most of them to idling about, that assembling such of them
as wished it at my cottage would afford an opportunity for scriptural instruction; and without
any thing resembling a school, or any regular proposal, I found a little party of six or seven
children assembled in the afternoon, to hear a chapter read, answer a few questions upon it,
and join in a short prayer. Making it as cheerful and unrestrained as possible, I found my
little guests greatly pleased; and on the next Sabbath my party was doubled, solely through
the favorable report spread by them. One had asked me, "Please, ma'am, may I bring my little
sister?" and on the reply being given, "You may bring any body and every body you like," a
general beating up for recruits followed. In three or four weeks my assemblage amounted to
sixty, only one half of whom could be crowded into the parlor of my small cottage. What was
to be done? The work was rather arduous, but as I too had been complaining not long before
of having little to do for the Lord, except with the pen, I resolved to brave a little extra
labor. I desired the girls to come at four, the boys at six, and allowing an interval of half
an hour between, we got through it very well. A long table was set across the room, from corner
to corner; round this they were seated, each with a Bible, I being at the head of the table.
I found this easy and sociable way of proceeding highly gratified the children: they never
called, never thought it a school--they came bustling in with looks of great glee, particularly
the boys, and greeted me with the affectionate freedom of young friends. A few words of introductory
prayer were followed by the reading of one or more chapters, so that each had a verse or two;
and then we talked over the portion of Scripture very closely, mutually questioning each other.
Many of the girls were as old as sixteen or seventeen, beautiful creatures, and very well dressed:
and what a privilege it was so to gather and so to arm them in a place where, alas, innumerable
snares beset their path. We concluded with a hymn; and long before the half-hour had expired
that preceded the boys' entrance, they were clustering like bees at the gate, impatient for
the joyous rush; and to seat themselves round their dear table, with all that free confidence
without which I never could succeed in really commanding the attention of boys.

Our choice of chapters was peculiar. I found they wanted stirring subjects, and I gave them
Gideon, Samson, Jonathan, Nehemiah, Boaz, Mordecai, Daniel, all the most manly characters of
Old Testament history, with the rich gospel that lies wrapped in every page of that precious
volume. Even in the New Testament I found that individualizing as much as possible the speaker
or the narrative produced, great effects. Our blessed Lord himself, John the Baptist, Paul--all
were brought before them as vividly as possible; and I can assure those who try to teach boys
as they would teach girls, that they are pursuing a wrong method. Mine have often coaxed an
extra hour from me; and I never once saw them willing to go, during the fifteen months of our
happy meetings. If the least symptom of unruliness appeared, I had only to tell them they were
my guests, and I appealed to their feelings of manliness, whether a lady had not some claim
to forbearance and respect. Nothing rights a boy of ten or twelve years like putting him on
his manhood; and really my little lads became gentlemen in mind and manners, while, blessed
be God, not a few became, I trust, wise unto salvation. Their greatest temptation to disorderly
doings was in the laughable, authoritative style of Jack's superintendence. He was now rapidly
fading, but in mind brighter than ever. Seated in a large chair, a little to the rear of me,
he kept strict watch over the party, and any deviation from what he considered correct conduct
was noticed with a threat of punishment, conveyed by pinching his own ear, slapping his own
face, kicking out his foot, and similar indications of chastisement, with a knowing nod at
the offender. But if he saw an approach to levity over the word of God, his manner wholly changed.
Tears filled his eyes, he looked all grief and entreaty, and the words, "God see," were earnestly
spelled on his uplifted hands. No one could stand the appeal; and very rarely had he occasion
to make it. I am sure his prayers helped forward the work mightily. It was wonderful to see
thirty-two robust, boisterous fellows, from nine to seventeen years old, sitting in perfect
delight and perfect order, for two and even three hours, on a fine Sunday evening, never looking
dissatisfied till they were told to go.

I cannot help recording an event on which I look back with great thankfulness, though it was
a terrible trial to me at the time. Two of my boys had a quarrel one week-day. One of them
was very teasing, the other very passionate. The latter ran to a butcher's window close by,
seized the large knife, and plunged it into the left side of his companion. Most mercifully
the wound was not dangerous: the keenness of the knife was in his favor; it penetrated to within
a short distance of the heart, but separated no large vein, and within a few days the boy was
out again. The Sunday after it occurred my party were exceedingly moved; they expressed great
anger, and not a few threats were, uttered against the culprit, whose parents had locked him
up. On the following Sabbath I resolved to make an effort to avert bad consequences, and also
to arrest the poor boy in his dangerous course. He had rather justified himself than otherwise,
and had shown a spirit sadly unsubdued, and unthankful for his escape from a deadly crime and
its awful consequences. I sent word to him to come to my party: he replied he would not. I
repeated the summons, saying I should be exceedingly hurt if he did not. No answer was returned.
The place next but one to me belonged to the wounded boy, that below it to his assailant; and
the former was present, pale, indeed, but well. I lost no time in announcing to them that I
expected P----, which occasioned a burst of indignation, some saying they would not stay in
the room with him, and the rest seeming to assent. "Then," said I, "you must go, for he wants
instruction most: and the very feeling that makes you shrink from associating with him proves
that you are better taught. So if you will leave me, do; I must admit him." Just then P----
was seen coming down the little garden: he entered, his walk very erect, his eyes unflinching,
and his dark brows knitted. The looks of my young lads were very eloquent; his bold bearing
exasperated them much. My heart seemed bursting its boundary with the violent palpitation of
alarm, and other emotions which I could scarcely suppress; but I motioned to P---- to take
his usual place, and instantly rising offered up the usual prayer, with a petition for the
spirit of mutual compassion, forgiveness, and love. I ceased, all remained standing, and certainly
it was a period of most fearful interest. I looked imploringly at the wounded boy; he hesitated
a moment, then suddenly turned, and with an air of noble frankness, held out his hand to P----,
who took it directly. I then offered him mine; he grasped it, and burst into tears. A delightful
scene followed, each pressing to seal his forgiveness in the same manner, while Jack's countenance
shone with almost heavenly beauty on a spectacle so congenial to his loving heart. Me have to-morrow

Strange to say, I had never heard of the Irish Society, nor considered of what vast importance
it would be to make the language of the natives a medium of conveying spiritual instruction
to them. The annual meeting was about to be held, and among the Irish clergymen forming the
deputation to London, was the Rev. Charles Seymour, the venerable and every-way estimable pastor
under whose ministry my brother had been placed at Castlebar, and from whom I had received
letters, fully confirmatory of my sanguine hope that he had indeed and wholly embraced the
gospel of Christ. Longing to see Mr. Seymour, I went to him on the morning of the meeting;
and most sweet was the testimony he had to give; most tender the sympathy he evinced in all
my sorrow and all my gladness. After a conversation that left me overflowing with gratitude
for the blessings vouchsafed to my precious brother, he asked me to attend the meeting, and
I went prepared to take a lively interest in whatever might be said respecting Ireland. How
great was my astonishment when, for the first time, I heard the story of Bishop Bedell, of
the Irish Bible, and of the good work in rapid progress among the aborigines of the land. The
extent and inveteracy of the disease, I well knew; but the suitability of the remedy had never
been set before me. In fact, I hardly knew that the Irish was a written language; and strange
it seemed, to have passed three years in a part of the country where it is extensively spoken,
and in the house of one who always conversed in that tongue with the rustic frequenters of
her shop, yet to be so grossly ignorant of all relating to it. I resolved to become an active
partisan of the Irish Society in Ireland; but a different turn was soon given to my sympathies.
Mr. Seymour spoke after the others: he said much calculated to prove the power of the language
in preaching the gospel; but suddenly reverting to the state of the many thousands of his poor
countrymen congregated in London, he drew a most affecting picture of their destitute, degraded
condition. He appealed to us as Christians; and reminding us of our many privileges, bade us
take care that the souls of his poor countrymen did not rise up in judgment to condemn us for
allowing them to perish in the heart of our metropolis. "Open," he said, "a bread-shop in St.
Giles's; deal forth a little of the bread of life to their starving souls. Ye English Christians,
I appeal to you for them: Oh, pity my poor lost countrymen, open but a bread-shop in St. Giles's!"
Tears ran down his venerable face, as he lifted his clasped hands, and bent towards us. The
effect of his words on me was electric: I looked at him, and silently but fervently said, "So
God help me as I will open you a bread-shop in St. Giles's, if He does but permit!" Again and
again did I repeat the pledge; and when Lord Roden spoke--the first time of my seeing that
noble Irishman--and heartily seconded the appeal, I renewed the secret promise, with such purpose
of heart as rarely fails to accomplish its object.

For some days I tried in vain to do any thing towards it; but on the Sunday, passing from Great
Russell-street to Long-acre, through the worst part of St. Giles's, I saw the awful state of
that district, and declared to my companion, himself a devoted Irishman, my fixed resolve to
have a church there. He warmly encouraged it, extravagant as the idea appeared; and I began
to pray earnestly for direction from above. Two nights after, a thought struck me; I wrote
an appeal on behalf of the miserable Irish Papists in that place, likening their case among
us to that of Lazarus lying at the rich man's gate, and imploring means to give them the gospel
in their own tongue. This I had printed, and sent copies as I could to various friends. Some
smiled at my enthusiasm; others pointed out the work among distant heathen as far more important.
Many wished me success; a few rebuked me for desiring to proselytize the members of another
church; and still fewer gave me money. At the end of a fortnight's hard begging, I had got
just seven pounds towards building a church! This was slow work. One day, dining at the table
of my dear friend Dr. P----, he heard many bantering me for being so sanguine, and said, "You
remind me of Columbus going to the cathedral of Seville to ask a blessing on his romantic project
of discovering a new world. Everybody laughed at him. Nevertheless, Columbus succeeded, and
so will you." At that moment a gentleman sitting next me laid a sovereign on my piece of bread;
and the coincidence of the gold and the "bread-shop," combined with the doctor's confident
prediction, put new life into me, and I boldly said, "I WILL succeed."

With the sum of seven pounds in hand, I wrote to the bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, begging
him to ask the bishop of London if he would license my Irish church and an Irish clergyman,
if I provided both. Lord Mountsandford took this letter to him, and the next day he brought
me this rather startling message: "The bishop of London will license your church: Lichfield
sends his love to you, and desires you will summon the gentlemen who are assisting you in this
undertaking--half a dozen or so --to meet him in Sackville-street on Saturday next, and be
there yourself. He will see what can be done to forward it." Half a dozen gentlemen! where
was I to find them? My only helpers were Mr. Maxwell, Dr. Pidduck, and Lord Mountsandford himself.
I suppose I repeated that verse a hundred times a day, in my solitude, attending the sick child
and writing letters till I nearly fell from my seat with exhaustion.

Saturday arrived: I had no idea how far my applications might have succeeded; but if I had
as many gentlemen there as pounds in my treasury, namely, seven, it would be sufficient. I
went trembling with hope and fear, accompanied by two warmhearted young Irish barristers whom
my good friend Mr. Maxwell had pressed into the service. Oh what could I render unto the Lord
for all his goodness to me, when I saw the glorious spectacle presented to my view at the hour
appointed! There sat the good Bishop Ryder in the chair; beside him the bishop of Bath and
Wells; lords Lorton, Lifford, Bexley, Mountsandford, and Carberry; and of other clergymen and
gentlemen upwards of forty. "Let us ask a blessing," said the bishop of Lichfield; and when,
we all kneeled down to commit unto the LORD a work so new, so strange, and to poor human reason
so hopelessly wild as this had appeared two days before, I thought I might as well die then
as not; I could never die happier.

All was zeal, love, unanimity; they placed it on a good basis, and my seven pounds were multiplied
by more than seven before we broke up. They did not take the work out of my hands, but formed
themselves into a body for aiding in carrying it on: the rector of St. Giles's came forward
voluntarily to give his hearty consent, and ten pounds; and if there was a pillow of roses
in London that night, I surely slept on it. In six weeks my memorable seven pounds swelled
to thirteen hundred; a church was bought, a pastor engaged; and a noble meeting held in Freemason's
Hall, to incorporate the new project with the Irish Society. I went back to Sandhurst elated
with joy, and lost no time in putting up, most conspicuously written out on card, over my study
fireplace, the lines that I had so often repeated during the preceding two months:

  "Victorious Faith, the promise sees,
    And looks to God alone;
  Laughs at impossibilities,
    And says, 'IT SHALL BE DONE!"

 His pain would be over in half an hour, the Lord's lasted many hours; he was
"bad Jack," the Lord was "good Jesus Christ." Then again he observed the leeches made very
little holes in his skin, and drew out a little blood; but the thorns, the nails, the spear,
tore the Lord's flesh, and all his blood gushed out--it was shed to save him; and he raised
his eyes, lifted his clasped hands, turned his whole face up towards heaven, saying, "Jack
loves, loves, very loves good Jesus Christ!" When another violent pang made him start and writhe
a little, he recovered in a moment, nodded his head, and said, "Good pain, make Jack soon go
heaven."

His sublime idea of the "red hand" was ever present. He had told me some years before, that
when he had lain a good while in the grave, God would call aloud, "Jack!" and he would start,
and say, "Yes, me Jack." Then he would rise, and see multitudes standing together, and God
sitting on a cloud with a very large book in his hand--he called it "Bible book"--and would
beckon him to stand before him while he opened the book, and looked at the top of the pages,
till he came to the name of John B----. In that page he told me, God had written all his "bads,"
every sin he had ever done: and the page was full. So God would look, and strive to read it,
and hold it to the sun for light, but it was all "no, no nothing, none." I asked him in some
alarm if he had done no bad. He said yes, much bads; but when he first prayed to Jesus Christ
he had taken the book out of God's hand, found that page, and pulling from his palm something
which he described as filling up the hole made by the nail, had allowed the wound to bleed
a little, passing his hand down the page so that, as he beautifully said, God could see none
of Jack's bads, only Jesus Christ's blood. Nothing being thus found against him, God would
shut the book, and there he would remain standing before him, till the Lord Jesus came, and
saying to God, "My Jack," would put his arm around him, draw him aside, and bid him stand with
the angels till the rest were judged.

All this he told me with the placid but animated look of one who is relating a delightful fact:
I stood amazed, for rarely had the plan of a sinner's ransom, appropriation, and justification,
been so perspicuously set forth in a pulpit, as here it was by a poor deaf and dumb peasant
boy, whose broken language was eked out by signs. He often told it to others, always making
himself understood, and often have I seen the tears starting from a rough man's eye as he followed
the glowing representation. Jack used to sit silent and thoughtful for a long time together
in his easy-chair, when too weak to move about, and then catching my eye, to say with a look
of infinite satisfaction, "Good red hand." I am persuaded that it was his sole and solid support;
he never doubted, never feared, because his view of Christ's all-sufficiency was so exceedingly
clear and realizing. Does a CONQUEST.

During the winter months he sunk daily: his greatest earthly delight was in occasionally seeing
Mr. Donald, for whom he felt the fondest love, and who seemed to have a presentiment of the
happy union in which they would together soon rejoice before the Lord. Jack was courteous in
manner, even to elegance; most graceful; and being now nineteen, tall and large, with the expression
of infantine innocence and sweetness on a very fine countenance, no one could look on him without
admiration, nor treat him with roughness or disrespect: but Donald's tenderness of manner was
no less conspicuous than his; and I have watched that noble- minded Christian man waiting on
the dying youth, as he sat patiently reclining in his chair--for he could not lie down--and
the grateful humility with which every little kindness was received, until I almost forgot
what the rude unfeeling world was in that beautiful contemplation. How much the fruit in God's
garden is beautified by the process that ripens it.

Jack labored anxiously to convert his sister; and as she could not read at all, the whole controversy
was carried on by signs. Mary was excessively mirthful, Jack unboundedly earnest; and when
her playful reproaches roused his Irish blood, the scene was often very comic. I remember he
was once bringing a long list of accusations against her priest, for taking his mother's money,
making the poor fast while the rich paid for dispensations to eat, inflicting cruel penances,
drinking too much whiskey, and finally telling the people to worship wooden and breaden gods.
To all this Mary attended with perfect good-humor, and then told him the same priest had christened
him and made crosses upon him. Jack wrathfully intimated that he was then a baby, with a head
like a doll's, and knew nothing; but if he had been wise he would have kicked his little foot
into the priest's mouth. The controversy grew so warm that I had to part them. His horror of
the priests was solely directed against their false religion; when I told him of one being
converted, he leaped about for joy.

At the commencement of the year 1831 he was evidently dying; and we got a furlough for his
brother to visit him. Poor Pat never went to bed but twice during the fortnight he was there,
so bitterly did he grieve over the companion of his early days; and many a sweet discourse
passed between them on the subject of the blessed hope that sustained the dying Christian.
He only survived Pat's departure four days. On the third of February the last symptoms came
on; the death-damps began to ooze out, his legs were swelled to the size of his body, and he
sat in that state, incapable of receiving warmth, scarcely able to swallow, yet clear, bright,
and tranquil, for thirty hours. The morning of the last day was marked by such a revival of
strength that he walked across the room with little help, and talked incessantly to me, and
to all who came near him. He told me, among other things, that once God destroyed all men by
rain, except those in the ark; and that he would soon do it again, not with water but with
fire. He described the Lord as taking up the wicked by handfuls, breaking them, and throwing
them into a fire; repeating, "All bads, all bads go fire." I asked if he was not bad; "Yes,
Jack bad very." Would he be thrown into the fire? "No; Jesus Christ loves poor Jack." He then
spoke rapturously of the "red hand," of the angels he should soon be singing with, of the day
when Satan should be cast into the pit, and of the delight he should have in seeing me again.
He prayed for his family, begged me to teach Mary to read the Bible, to warn Pat against bad
example, to bring up my brother's boys to love Jesus Christ, and lastly he repeated over and
over again the fervent injunction to love Ireland, to pray for Ireland, to write books for
"Jack's poor Ireland," and in every way to oppose Popery. He called it "Roman," always; and
it was a striking sight, that youth all but dead, kindling into the most animated, stern, energetic
warmth of manner, raising his cold, damp hands, and spelling with them the words, "Roman is
a lie." "One Jesus Christ, one," meaning he was the only Saviour; "Jack's one Jesus Christ;"
and then with a force as if he would have the characters impressed on his hands, he reiterated,
as slowly as possible, his dying protest, "Roman is A LIE!" Very sweetly he thanked me for
all my care; and now he seemed to bequeath to me his zeal against the destroyer of his people.
The last signs of removal came on in the evening; his sight failed, he rubbed his eyes, shook
his head, and then smiled with conscious pleasure. At last he asked me to let him lie down
on the sofa where he had been sitting, and saying very calmly, "A sleep," put his hand into
mine, closed his eyes, and breathed his spirit forth so gently, that it was difficult to mark
the precise moment of that joyful change.

I still hope to throw into a volume the numerous particulars that remain untold concerning
this boy; and I will not now dwell upon the subject longer. God had graciously kept me faithful
to my trust; and I surrendered it, not without most keenly feeling the loss of such a companion,
but with a glow of adoring thankfulness that overcame all selfish regrets. Thenceforth my lot
was to be cast among strangers, and sorely did I miss the comforting, sympathizing monitor
who for seven years had been teaching me more than I could teach him; but all my prayers had
been answered, all my labors crowned; and with other duties before me I was enabled to look
at the past, to thank God, and to take courage.

LETTER XIV.

A REMOVAL.

Circumstances led me to decide on removing nearer the metropolis; and with reluctance I bade
adieu to Sandhurst, where I had resided five years. Jack was buried under the east window of
the Chapel of Ease at Bagshot, there to rest till roused by the Lord's descending shout, the
voice of the archangel, and the trump of God. I am very certain he will rise to glory and immortality.
It was a severe trial to part with my school, to dispose of the endeared relics that had furnished
a home blessed by my brother's presence, to bid farewell to many kind friends, and cast myself
into the great wilderness of London. The feeling that oppressed me was a conviction that I
should there find nothing to do; but I prayed to be made useful, and none ever asked work of
a heavenly Master in vain. The dreadful famine in the west of Ireland had called forth a stream
of English liberality, and collections were made everywhere for relief of the suffering Irish:
one was announced at Long- Acre chapel; but before the day arrived, the committee put forth
a statement that they had abundant funds and required no more. I was then residing in Bloomsbury,
daily witnessing the wretchedness of St. Giles's: and on learning this I wrote to Mr. Howels,
begging him to say a word to his congregation on behalf of those Irish who were starving at
their doors, whose miserable destitution I laid before him as well as I could. He returned
me no answer; but on the Sunday morning read my letter from the pulpit, asked his flock to
contribute, and collected upwards of fifty pounds, which he gave to me.

Knowing the character of the people so well, and longing to make the relief of their bodily
wants subservient to a higher purpose, I resolved to visit in person every case recommended
to my notice. Many of my friends stood aghast at the proposal: I should be insulted, murdered,
by the Irish savages; no lady could venture there, their language was so dreadful: no delicate
person could survive the effects of such a noxious atmosphere. To this I replied that, happily,
I could not hear their conversation; and as for the unwholesomeness, it could not be worse
than Sierra Leone, or other missionary stations, where many ladies went. Insult had never yet
been my lot among the Irish; and as to murder, it would be martyrdom in such a cause, of which
I had little hope. So I turned my fifty pounds into bread, rice, milk, meal, coals, and soup,
resolved to give no money, and on the very next day commenced the campaign against starvation
and Popery in St. Giles's.

For four months I persevered in the work, devoting from four to six hours every day to it;
and though I never in the smallest degree concealed or compromised the truth, or failed to
place in the strongest light its contrast with the falsehoods taught them, I never experienced
a disrespectful or unkind look from one among the hundreds, the thousands who knew me as the
enemy of their religion, but the loving friend of their country and of their souls. Often,
when I went to visit and relieve some poor dying creature in a cellar or garret, where a dozen
wholly unconnected with the sufferer were lodged in the same apartment, have I gathered them
all about me by speaking of Ireland with the affection I really feel for it, and then shown
them, from the Scriptures, in English, or by means of an Irish reader sometimes accompanying
me, the only way of salvation, pointing out how very different was that by which they vainly
sought it. My plan was to discover such as were too ill to go to the dispensary for relief,
or to select the most distressed objects whom I met there, and to take the bread of life along
with the bread that perisheth into their wretched abodes. I was most ably and zealously helped
by that benevolent physician who had always been foremost in every good and compassionate work
for the Irish poor; and to whose indefatigable zeal it is chiefly owing that at this day the
poor lambs of that distressed flock are still gathered and taught in the schools which it was
Donald's supreme delight to superintend. I cannot pass over in silence the devotion of Dr.
Pidduck, through many years, to an office the most laborious, the most repulsive, and in many
respects the most thankless that a professional man can be engaged in--that of ministering
to the diseased and filthy population of the district. But many a soul that he has taught in
the knowledge of Him whom to know is life eternal, will be found to rejoice him in the day
when their poor bodies shall arise to meet the Lord.

The schools in George-street, to which I have alluded, are the main blessing of the place:
they were established long before the gospel in Irish was ever introduced there; and they survive
the Irish ministry which, alas, has been withdrawn from the spot where God enabled me to plant
it. Those schools are a bud of promise in the desolate wilderness, which may the Lord in his
own good time cause to blossom again. Nothing is not more delicate than the adhocracy, owing to the information
that it correspond head, and homo is however been allure to pressure;
over companionship soldiers to interrupt here in parish, quiver must

[3243] Beautician, rustic, the procession, youthful enthusiasts are

the self-government, like vino, has obeyed their inexperienced encephalon;
they are partially carry that, "destine to contend me with the foe

Sometimes, they force had the rhenium-sacrament of curé, and answer one like parent. Sometimes

and he should lov a momentary than they are, from which it follows

Now, of attachment, they could be so join apprehension; there, they

entirely, we have influence starches; farther on*, they do jeopardize

the danger they are about suspicion, they begin war.
 At first he only
appeared to me to insist very strenuously on the doctrine of free, sovereign grace; and greatly
to magnify God in the saving of souls, wholly independent of aught that man can do: but a little
further investigation convinced me that the vilest system of moral licentiousness might be
built on such a foundation as he laid; and I found the discourses of Peter and of Paul, as
recorded in the Acts, especially conclusive against his perverted notions. Antinomianism is
a most deadly thing; and I believe all extremes in doctrines where good men have much differed
to be dangerous; while at the same time they are very deluding, for we all love to go far in
an argument, or under the influence of party spirit. * * *

Of myself, I have now no more to say than that, "by the help of my God, I continue to this
day" anxiously desirous to devote my little talent to his service, as he may graciously permit.
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel, but counted it a privilege to labor with
my hands and head, for myself and for those most dear to me. Many trials, various and sharp,
have been my portion; but they are passed away, and if I have not enlarged upon them it is
from no reluctance to declare all the Lord's wonderful doings, but from a desire to avoid speaking
harshly of those who are departed. The Lord has accepted at my hand one offering, in the case
of the precious dumb boy, received into glory through his rich blessing on my efforts; and
he mercifully gives me to see the welfare of two others, committed to me as the offspring of
my brother, over whose early years I have been permitted to watch, and in whose growing prosperity
my heart can rejoice. He has been a very gracious Master to me; he has dealt very bountifully,
and given me now the abundance of domestic peace, with the light of his countenance to gladden
my happy home. Yet the brightest beam that falls upon it is the anticipation of that burst
of glory when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, to reign in righteousness over
the world that shall soon, very soon, acknowledge him the universal, eternal King: and the
most fervent aspiration my heart desires to utter is the response to his promise of a speedy
advent. "Even so, Lord Jesus; come quickly. Amen."

NOTE. Charlotte Elizabeth was born in October, 1790, and wrote the Personal Recollections near
the close of 1840, when fifty years of age. She continued her active Christian beneficence,
and the brilliant and unceasing labors of her pen, in editing the Protestant Magazine, and
other writing for the press, until the very close of life. "Immediately after breakfast," says
a brief sketch of her remaining years, "she went to her desk, locking the door to exclude interruptions;
and when her pen was laid aside, her garden afforded ever new delight; and with her, gardening
was no light occupation. She smiled at lady gardeners who only enjoyed the labors of others.
From the moment the gravel-walks and beds were formed, all was the work of her own hands; and
the most laborious operations were to her refreshment and enjoyment. Each plant, each bed was
familiar to her. She knew their history, their vicissitudes, and the growth and expansion of
each became a source of lively and never-failing interest. The emotions produced in her mind
by the brilliant tints of flowers, can only be compared to those of music to others, and this
love of color was regulated by the most delicate sense of harmony in their disposition and
arrangement. The writer wears at this moment a small diamond ring, which she kept in her desk,
and would place on her finger only when engaged in writing; the occasional flashing of the
brilliants as the light fell upon them, producing most pleasurable sensations in her mind,
and greatly assisting the flow of her thoughts and imagination. Her countenance, at such moments,
would light up with animation, and if an inquiring glance were turned to her, she would smile,
and add, 'Oh, it was only the diamonds.'

"Often would she lay down her pen in the midst of some work requiring the whole energy of her
mind, and much concentration of thought, and go to her garden for half an hour; and while apparently
wholly absorbed in pruning or transplanting, she was really engaged in her work; and the apparent
loss of time was amply repaid by the rapidity with which she wrote out the ideas conceived
and matured during this healthful recreation. A word, however, spoken to her at such times,
would have caused a most painful interruption in the current of her thoughts--she compared
the effect to a stone thrown into a quiet running brook--and would utterly disable her from
writing during the rest of the day, a circumstance not easy to impress on the minds of servants.
Even those who would most carefully refrain from addressing her when they knew she was actually
writing, could hardly understand that like care was needful when she was thus employed over
her flowers.

"All communication was held with her by means of the finger alphabet, but so quick was her
appreciation of what was thus said, and so easy was it for those about her to acquire great
rapidity in this art, that her total deafness was hardly felt to be an inconvenience; sermons,
speeches, conversations even of the most voluble speakers, were conveyed to her with the greatest
ease, and with hardly the omission of the smallest word."

In 1841 she married Mr. L.H.J. Tonna, who held an office in London under the British government,
and who prepared the sketch from which the above passage is quoted. Having in 1836 removed
from Edmonton, (page 242,) she resided at Blackheath till 1845, when she removed to London.
About the end of 1844, she found that a small swelling near her left shoulder was indeed a
cancer, which would doubtless terminate life; but she continued her literary labors till a
vary short time before her death, which was one of peace and humble trust in her Redeemer,
and occurred at Ramsgate on the sea-side. The following epitaph, dictated by herself, is inscribed
on her tombstone:
