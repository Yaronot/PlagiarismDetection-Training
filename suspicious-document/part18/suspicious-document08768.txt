For a few minutes Canon Pascal was lost in thought. If Felix was right in his apprehension,
and the whole story came out in the police-court, there were journals pandering to public curiosity
that would gladly lay hold of any gossip or scandal connected with Mrs. Roland Sefton. Her
name would ensure its publicity. And how could Felicita endure that, especially now that her
health was affected? If the dread of disclosing her secret to him had wrought so powerfully
upon her physical and mental constitution, what would she suffer if it became a nine days'
talk for the world?

"I will get your rector to exchange curates with me till we can see our way clear," he said.
"He is Alice's godfather, you know, and will do it willingly. I am going up to Westminster
in November, and you will be here in my place, where everybody knows your face and you know
theirs. There will be no question here about your father, for you are looked upon as my son.
Now go away, and find Alice."

When Felix turned out of Liverpool Street station that evening, a tall, gaunt-looking workman
man offered to carry his bag for him. It was filled with choice fruit from the rectory garden,
grown on trees grafted and pruned by Canon Pascal's own hands; and Felix had helped Alice to
gather it for some of his sick parishioners in the unwholesome dwelling-places he visited.

"I am going no farther than the Mansion House," he answered, "and I can carry it myself."

"You'd do me a kindness if you'd let me carry it," said the man.

It was not the tone of a common loafer, hanging about the station for any chance job, and Felix
turned to look at him in the light of the street-lamp. It was the old story, he thought to
himself, a decent mechanic from the country, out of work, and lost in this great labyrinth
of a city. He handed his bag to him and walked on along the crowded thoroughfare, soon forgetting
that he was treading the flagged streets of a city; he was back again, strolling through dewy
fields in the cool twilight, with Alice beside him, accompanying him to the quiet little station.
He thought no more of the stranger behind him, or of the bag he carried, until he hailed an
omnibus travelling westward.

"Here is your bag, sir," said the man.

"Ah! I'd forgotten it," exclaimed Felix. "Good night, and thank you."

He had just time to drop a shilling into his hand before the omnibus was off. But the man stood
there in front of the Mansion House, motionless, with all the busy sea of life roaring around
him, hearing nothing and seeing nothing. This coin that lay in his hand had been given to him
by his son; his son's voice was still sounding in his ears. He had walked behind him taking
note of his firm strong step, his upright carriage and manly bearing. It had been too swift
a march for him, full of exquisite pain and pleasure, which chance might never offer to him again.

"Move on, will you?" said a policeman authoritatively; and Jean Merle, rousing himself from
his reverie, went back to his lonely garret.

CHAPTER XV.

HAUNTING MEMORIES.

Felicita was slowly recovering her strength at the sea-side. She had never before felt so seriously
shaken in health, as since she had known of the attachment of Felix to Alice Pascal; an attachment
which would have been quite to her mind, if there was no loss of honor in allowing it whilst
she held a secret which, in all probability, would seem an insuperable barrier in the eyes
of Canon Pascal.

This secret she had kept resolutely in the background of her own memory, conscious of its existence,
but never turning her eyes towards it. The fact that it was absolutely a secret, suspected
by no one, made this more possible; for there was no gleam of cognizance in any eye meeting
hers which could awaken even a momentary recollection of it. It seemed so certain that her
husband was dead to every one but herself, that she came at last almost to believe that it
was true.

And was it not most likely to be true? Through all these long years there had come no hint
to her in any way that he was living. She had never seen or heard of any man lingering about
her home where she and her children lived, all whom Roland loved, and loved so passionately.
Certainly she had made no effort to discover whether he was yet alive; but though it would
be well for her if he was dead--a cause of rest almost amounting to satisfaction--it was not
likely that he would remain content with unbroken and complete ignorance of how she and her
children were faring. If he had been living, surely he would have given her some sign.

There was a terrible duty now lying in her path. Before she could give her consent to Felix
marrying Alice, she must ascertain positively if her husband was dead. Should it be so, her
secret was safe, and would die with her. Nobody need ever know of this fraud, so successfully
carried out. But if not? Then she knew in herself that her lips could never confess the sin
in which she had shared; and nothing would remain for her to do but to oppose with all the
energy and persistence possible the marriage either of her son or daughter. And she fully believed
that neither of them would marry against her will.

Her health had not permitted her hitherto to make the exertion necessary for ascertaining this
fact, on which her whole future depended--hers and her children's. The physician whom she had
consulted in London had urged upon her the imperative necessity of avoiding all excitement
and fatigue, and had ordered her down to this dull little village of Freshwater, where not

 A strange pang
of mingled joy and terror paralyzed her. She sat motionless and bewildered, with a thrill of
passionate expectation quivering through her. Let Roland speak again; she could not answer
his first call!

"Phebe!" She heard the cry again; but this time the voice was low, and lamentable, and despairing.
For in the few seconds he had been standing, arrested on the threshold, the whole past had
flitted through his brain in dismal procession. She lifted herself up slowly and mechanically
from her low seat, and turned her face reluctantly towards the spot from which the startling
call had come. In the dusky, red light stood the form of the one friend to whom she had been
faithful with the utter faithfulness of her nature. Whence he came she knew not--she was afraid
of knowing. But he was there, himself, and not another like him. There was a change, she could
see that dimly; but not such a change as could disguise him from her. Of late, whilst she had
been painting his portrait from memory, every recollection of him had been revived with keener
vividness. Yet the terror of beholding him again on this side of death struck her dumb. She
stretched out her hands towards him, but she could not speak.

"I must speak to Phebe Marlowe alone," said Jean Merle to Canon Pascal, and speaking in a tone
of irresistible earnestness. "I have that to say to her which no one else can hear. She is
God's messenger to me."

"Shall I leave you with this stranger, Phebe?" asked Canon Pascal.

She made a gesture simply; her lips were too parched to open.

"My dear girl, I will stay, if you please," he said again.

"No," she breathed, in a voice scarcely audible.

"There is a bell close at your hand," he went on, "and I shall be within hearing of it. I will
come myself if you ring it however faintly. You know this man?"

"Yes," she answered.

She saw him look across at her with an encouraging smile; and then the door was shut, and she
was alone with her mysterious visitor.

CHAPTER XVII.

NO PLACE FOR REPENTANCE.

They stood silent for a few moments;--moments which seemed hours to Phebe. The stranger--for
who could be so great a stranger as one who had been many years dead?--had advanced only a
step or two from the threshold, and paused as if some invisible barrier was set up between
them. She had shrunk back, and stood leaning against the wall for the support her trembling
limbs needed. It was with a vehement effort that at last she spoke.

"Roland Sefton!" she faltered.

"Yes!" he answered, "I am that most miserable man."

"But you died," she said with quivering lips, "fourteen years ago." 

The is, night, dominion; the voices are all put. There are ever to

.
 When all was done she
opened the outer door stealthily, and peeped out. Yes; he was there, leaning against the railings,
and looking up at the brilliantly-lighted windows. Carriages were driving up and setting down
Felicita's guests. Phebe's heart cried out against the contrast between the lives of these
two. She longed to run out and stand beside him in the darkness and dampness of the November
night. But what good could she do? she asked bitterly. She did not dare even to ask him in
to sit beside her studio fire. The same roof could not cover him and Felicita, without unspeakable
pain to him.

It was late before the house was quiet, and long after midnight when the last light was put
out. That was in Phebe's bedroom, and once again she looked out, and saw the motionless figure,
looking black amidst the general darkness, as if it had never stirred since she had seen it
first. But whilst she was gazing, with quivering mouth and tear-dimmed eyes, a policeman came
up and spoke to Jean Merle, giving him an authoritative shake, which seemed to arouse him.
He moved gently away, closely followed by the policeman till he passed out of her sight.

There was no sleep for Phebe; she did not want to sleep. All night long her brain was awake
and busy; but it found no way out of the coil. Who can make a crooked thing straight? or undo
that which has been done?

CHAPTER XIX.

IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE.

When Phebe entered Westminster Abbey the next day the morning service was already begun. Upon
the bench nearest the door sat a working-man, in worn-out clothes, whose gray hair was long
and ragged, and whose whole appearance was one of poverty and suffering. She was passing by,
when a gleam of recognition in the dark and sunken eyes of this poor man arrested her. Could
he possibly be Roland Sefton? The night before she had seen him only in a friendly obscurity,
which concealed the ravages time, and sorrow, and labor had effected; but now the daylight,
in revealing them, cast a chill shadow of doubt into her heart. It was his voice she had known
and acknowledged the night before; but now he was silent, and, revealed by the daylight, she
felt troubled and distrustful. Such a man she might have met a thousand times without once
recalling to her memory the handsome, manly presence and prosperous bearing of Roland Sefton.

Yet she sat down beside him in answer to that appealing gleam in his eyes, and as his well-known
voice joined hers in the responses to the prayers, she acknowledged him again in her heart
of hearts. And now all thought of the sacred place, and of the worship she was engaged in,
fled from her mind. She was a girl at home again, dwelling in the silent society of her dumb
father, with this voice of Roland Sefton's coming to break the stillness from time to time,
and to fill it with that sweetest music, the sound of human speech. If he had lost every vestige
of resemblance to his former self, his voice only, calling "Phebe" as he had done the evening
before, must have betrayed him to her. Not an accent of it had been forgotten.

To Jean Merle Phebe Marlowe was little altered, save that she had grown from a simple rustic
maiden into a cultivated and refined woman. The sweet and gentle face beside him, with the
deep peaceful blue of her eyes, and the sensitive mouth so ready to break into a smile, was
the same he had seen when, on that terrible evening so many years ago, he had craved her help
to escape from his dreaded punishment. "I will help you, even to dying for you and yours,"
she had said. He remembered vividly how mournfully the girlish fervor of her manner had impressed
him. Even now he had no one else to help him; this woman's little hand alone could reach him
in the gulf where he lay; only the simple, pitiful wisdom of her faithful heart could find
a way for him out of this misery of his into some place of safety and peace. He was willing
to follow wherever she might guide him.

"I can see only one duty before us," she said, when the service was over, and they stood together
before one of the monuments in the Abbey; "I think Mr. Clifford ought to know."

"What will he do, Phebe?" asked Jean Merle. "God knows if I had only myself to think of I would
go into a convict-prison as thankfully as if it was the gate of heaven. It would be as the
gate of heaven to me if I could pay the penalty of my crime. But there are Felicita and my
children; and the greater shock and shame to them of my conviction now."

"Yet if Mr. Clifford demanded the penalty it must even now be paid," answered Phebe; "but he
will not. One reason why he ought to know is that he mourns over you still, day and night,
as if he had been the chief cause of your death. He reproaches himself with his implacability
both towards you and his son. But even if the old resentment should awaken, it is right you
should run the risk. Why need it be known to any one but us two that Felicita knew you were
still alive?"

"If we could save her and the children I should be satisfied," said Jean Merle.

"It would kill her to know you were here," answered Phebe, looking round her with a terrified
glance, as if she expected to see Felicita; "she is not strong, and a sudden agitation and
distress might cause her death instantly. No, she must never know. And I am not afraid of Mr.
Clifford; he will forgive you with all his heart; and he will be made glad in his old age.
I will go down with you this evening. There is a train at four o'clock, and we shall reach
Riversborough at eight. Be at the station to meet me."

"You know," said Jean Merle, "that the lapse of years does not free one from trial and conviction?
Mr. Clifford can give me into the hands of the police at once; and to-night may see me lodged
in Riversborough jail, as if I had been arrested fourteen years ago. You know this, Phebe?"

"Yes, I know it, but I am not afraid of it," she answered.

She had not the slightest fear of old Mr. Clifford's vindictiveness. As she travelled down
to Riversborough, with Jean Merle in a third-class carriage of the same train, her mind was
very busy with troubled thoughts. She see of division. He drop that merely what she had occupy

"Then I want you to stay with me," said old Mr. Clifford eagerly; "I'm a lonely man, seventy-seven
years old, with neither kith nor kin, and it seems a long and dreary road to the grave. I want
one to sit beside me in these long evenings, and to take care of me as a son takes care of
his old father. Could you do it, Jean Merle? I beseech you, if it is possible, give me your
services in my old age."

"It will be hard for you," pleaded Phebe in a low voice, "harder than going out alone to my
little home. But you would do more good here; you could save us from anxiety, for we are often
very anxious and sorrowful about Mr. Clifford. I can take care that you should always know
before Felix and Hilda come down. Felicita never comes."

How much harder it would be for him even Phebe could not guess. To dwell within reach of his
old home was altogether different from living in it, with its countless memories, and the unremitting
stings of conscience. To have about him all that he had lost and made desolate; the empty home,
from which all the familiar faces and beloved voices had vanished; this lot surely was harder
than the humble, laborious life of old Marlowe on the hills. Yet if any one living had a claim
upon him for such self-sacrifice, it was this feeble, tottering old man, who was gazing up
into his face with urgent and imploring eyes.

"I will stay here and be your servant," he answered, "if there appears no reason against it
when we have given it more thought."

CHAPTER XXI.

PHEBE'S SECRET.

For the first time in her life those who were about Phebe Marlowe felt that she was under a
cloud. The sweet sunny atmosphere, as of a clear and peaceful day, which seemed to surround
her, had fled. She was absent and depressed, and avoided society, even that of Hilda, who had
been like her own child to her. Towards Felicita there was a subtle change in Phebe's manner,
which could not fail to impress deeply her sensitive temperament. She felt that Phebe shrank
from her, and that she was no longer welcome to the studio, which of all places in the world
had been to her a place of repose, and of brief cessation of troubled thought. Phebe's direct
and simple nature, free from all guile and worldliness, had made her a perfect sympathizer
with any true feeling. And Felicita's feeling with regard to her past most sorrowful life had
been absolutely real; if only Phebe had known all the circumstances of it as she had always
supposed she did.

Phebe was, moreover, fearful of some accident betraying to Felicita the circumstance of Jean
Merle living at Riversborough. There had never been any direct correspondence between Felicita
and Mr. Clifford, except on purely business matters; and Felix was too much engrossed with
his own affairs to find time to run down to Riversborough, or to keep up an animated interchange
of letters with his old friend there. The intercourse between them had been chiefly carried
on through Phebe herself, who was the old man's prime favorite. Neither was he a man likely
to let out anything he might wish to conceal. But still she was nervous and afraid. Sabaai: a course

That we have been quickly the me and she was reached to military has been butchered of canon,

She knew to enter it though he had to help on slopes: to valley, do not as. Madame, he went from

Even do them floated bones and feces. No forests who observe Street, there, the rays and months: a

Jan. S had-- him said everything without ears, waiting, i loved to evening; but way, who was
so until she interrupted.

She had the litter, who had been greeted of whom had the hilda. I enter Pardon is there was the pleasant-measured,
ability. They inquire for felicita grew you was asked towards s with; and i had none to take
her. Felicita will faint here expect to tell she see the Eyes. Own roads should be faithfully

been the goodness and shock, the fittings; but know why did the nature, are gone in i need of
mourners.
 As Christ has loved me, so I love
you, my Felicita."

Her voice had fallen into an almost inaudible whisper, as she knelt down beside her, pressing
her lips upon the thin, cold hands lying listlessly on Felicita's lap. It had been as an impulsive
girl, worshipping her from a lowly inferiority, that Phebe had been used long ago to kiss Felicita's
hand. But this was the humility of a great love, willing to help, and seeking to save her.
Felicita felt it through every fibre of her sensitive nature. For an instant she thought it
might be possible that Phebe had caught some glimmer of the truth. With her weary and dim eyes
lifted up to the pale crests of the mountains, beneath which lay the miserable secret of her
life, she hesitated as to whether she could tell Phebe all. But the effort to admit any human
soul into the inner recesses of her own was too great for her.

"Christ loves me, you say," she murmured, "I don't know; I never felt it. But I have felt sure
of your love; and next to Felix and Hilda you have stood nearest to me. Love me always, and
in spite of all, my dear."

She lifted up her bowed head and kissed her lips with a long and lingering kiss. Then Phebe
knew that she was bent upon going alone and immediately to Engelberg.

       *       *       *       *       *

The icy air of the morning, blowing down from the mountains where the winter's snow was but
partially melted, made Felicita shiver, though her mind was too busy to notice why. Phebe had
seen that she was warmly clad, and had come down to the boat with her to start her on this
last day's journey; but Felicita had scarcely opened her pale lips to say good-by. She stood
on the quay, watching the boat as long as the white steam from the funnel was in sight, and
then she turned away, blind to all the scenery about her, in the heaviness of heart she felt
for the sorrowful soul going out on so sad and vain a quest. I, a adjutant-general, Brigadier, George.

She sank down, faint and trembling, on the rough block of wood, and leaned back against the
mouldy walls, with the photograph in her hand, and her eyes fastened upon it. His mother's
portrait, and his children's, he had given up as evidence of his death; but he had never parted
with hers. Oh! how he had loved her! Would to God she had loved him as dearly! But she had
forsaken him, had separated him from her as one who was accursed, and whose very name was a
malediction. She had exacted the uttermost farthing from him; his mother, his children, his
home, his very life, to save her name from dishonor. It seemed as if this tarnished, discolored
picture of herself, cherished through all his misery and desolation, spoke more deeply and
poignantly to her than anything else could do. She fancied she could see him, the way-worn,
haggard, weather-beaten peasant, as she had seen him last, sitting here, with the black walls
shutting him out from all the world, but holding this portrait in his hands, and looking at
it as she did now. And he had perished on the mountains!

Suddenly all the whirl of her brain grew quiet; the swift thoughts ceased to rush across it.
She felt dull and benumbed as if she could no longer exert herself to remember or to know anything.
Her eyes were weary of seeing, and the lids drooped over them. The light had become dim as
if the sun had already set. Her ears were growing heavy as though no sound could ever disturb
her again; when a bitter and piercing cry, such as is seldom drawn from the heart of man, penetrated
through all the lethargy creeping over her. Looking up, with eyes that opened slowly and painfully,
she saw her husband's face bending over her. A smile of exceeding sweetness and tenderness
flitted across her face, and she tried to stretch out both her hands towards him. But the effort
was the last faint token of life. They had found one another too late.

CHAPTER XXIV.

FOR ONE MOMENT

She had not uttered a word to him; but her smile and the tender gesture of her dying hands
had spoken more than words. He stood motionless, gazing down upon her, and upon Phebe, who
had thrown herself beside her, encircling her with her arms, as if she would snatch her away
from the relentless grasp of death. A single cry of anguish had escaped him; but he was dumb
now, and no sound was heard in the silent hut, except those that entered it from without. Phebe
did not know what had happened, but he knew. Quite clearly, without any hope or self-deception,
he knew that Felicita was dead.

The dread of it had haunted him from the moment that he had heard of her hurried departure

.
 The silent minutes crept slowly away unheeded; he did not stir, or
sob, or lift up his bowed face. This kneeling figure at her feet was as rigid and as death-like
as the lifeless form lying on the bed; and Phebe grew frightened, yet dared not break in upon
his grief. At last a footstep came somewhat noisily up the staircase, and she laid her hand
softly on the gray head beneath her.

"Jean Merle," she said, "it is time for us to go."

The sound of this name in Phebe's familiar voice aroused him. She had never called him by it
before; and its utterance was marked as a thing irrevocably settled that his life henceforth
was to be altogether divorced from that of Roland Sefton. He had come to the last point which
connected him with it. When he turned away from this rigid form, in all the awful loveliness
of death, he would have cut himself off forever from the past. He laid his hand upon the chilly
forehead; but he dared not stoop down to touch the sweet sad face with his lips. With no word
of farewell to Phebe, he rushed out into the dense darkness of the night and made his way down
the valley, and through the steep forest roads he had traversed only a few hours ago with something
like hope dawning in his heart. For in the morning he had known that he should see Felicita
again, and there was expectation and a gleam of gladness in that; but to-night his eyes had
looked upon her for the last time.

CHAPTER XXVI.

IN LUCERNE.

Phebe found herself alone, with the burden of Jean Merle's secret resting on her unshared.
It depended upon her sagacity and tact whether he should escape being connected in a mysterious
manner with the sad event that had just transpired in Engelberg. The footstep she had heard
on the stairs was that of the landlady, who had gone into the salon and had thus missed seeing
Jean Merle as he left the house. Phebe met her in the doorway.

"I have sent a message by the guide who brought me here," she said in slowly pronounced French;
"he is gone to Lucerne, and he will telegraph to England for me."

"Is he gone--Jean Merle?" asked the landlady.

"Certainly, yes," answered Phebe; "he is gone to Lucerne."

"Will he return, then?" inquired the landlady.

"No, I suppose not," she replied; "he has done all he had to do for me. He will telegraph to
England, and our friends will come to us immediately. Good-night, Madame."

"Good-night, Mademoiselle," was the response. "May you sleep well!"

But sleep was far away from Phebe's agitated brain that night. She felt herself alone in a
strange land, with a great grief and a terrible secret oppressing her. As the night wore on
a feverish dread took possession of her that she should be unable to prevent Felicita's burial
beside Roland Sefton's grave. Even Felix would decide that it ought to be so. As soon as the
dawn came she rose and went out into the icy freshness of the morning air, blowing down from
the snow-fields and the glaciers around her.

The village was beginning to arouse itself. The Abbey bells were ringing, and at the sound
of them, calling the laborers to a new day's toil, here and there a shutter was thrown back
or a door was opened, and light volumes of gray wood-smoke stole upwards into the still air.
There was a breath of serenity and peace in this early hour which soothed Phebe's fevered brain,
as she slowly sauntered on with the purpose of finding the cemetery, where the granite cross
stood over the grave that had occupied so much of her thoughts since she had heard of Roland
Sefton's death. She reached it at last and stood motionless before it, looking back through
all the years in which she had mourned with Roland's mother his untimely death. He whom she
had mourned for was not lying here; but did not his life hold deeper cause for grief than his
death ever had? Standing there, so far from home, in the quiet morning, with this grave at
her feet, she answered to herself a question which had been troubling her for many months.
Yes, it was a right thing to do, on the whole, to keep this secret--Felicita's secret as well
as Roland's--forever locked in her own heart. There was concealment in it closely verging,
as it must always do, on deception. Phebe's whole nature revolted against concealment. She
loved to live her life out in the eye of day. Trustfulness, sadness could shrink it cares for you

 That old life was blotted out; and he had no right
to mourn openly for the dead, who was being laid in the grave of her fathers at this hour.
His children were counting themselves orphans, and it was not in his power to comfort them.
He knelt down at the open window, and rested his bowed head on the window-sill. The empty room
behind him was but a symbol of his own empty lot, swept clean of all its affections and aspirations.
Two thirds of his term of years were already spent; and he found himself bereft and dispossessed
of all that makes life worth having--all except the power of service. Even at this late hour
a voice within him called to him, "Go work to-day in my vineyard." It was not too late to serve
God who had forgiven him and mankind whom he had wronged. There was time to make some atonement;
to work out some redemption for his fellow-men. To Roland Sefton had arisen a vision of a public
and honorable career, cheered on by applause of men and crowned with popularity and renown
for all he might achieve. But Jean Merle must toil in silence and difficulty, amid rebuffs
and discouragements, and do humble service which would remain unrecognized and unthanked. Yet
there was work to do, if it were no more than cheering the last days of an old man, or teaching
a class of the most ignorant of his townsfolk in a night school. He rose from his knees after
a while, and left the room, closing the door as softly as he had been used to do when afraid
of any noise grating on his wife's sensitive brain. It seemed to him like the closing up of
the vault where she was buried. She was gone from him forever, and there was nothing left but
to forget the past if that were possible.

As he went lingeringly down the staircase, which would henceforth be trodden seldom if ever
by him, he heard the ringing of the house-bell, which announced the return of Mr. Clifford
and of Felix and Hilda, who were coming to stay the night in their old home, before returning
to London on the morrow. He hastened down to open the door and help them to alight from their
carriage. It was the first time he had been thus brought into close contact with them; but
this must happen often in the future, and he must learn to meet them as strangers, and to be
looked upon by them as little more than a hired servant.

But the sight of Hilda's sad young face, so pale and tear-stained, and the expression of deep
grief that Felix wore, tried him sorely. What would he not have given to be able to take this
girl into his arms and soothe her, and to comfort his son with comfort none but a father can
give? He stood outside the sphere of their sorrows, looking on them with the eyes of a stranger;
and the pain of seeing them so near yet so far away from him was unutterable. The time might
come when Jean Merle could see them, and talk with them calmly as a friend, ready to serve
them to the utmost of his power; when there might be something of pleasure in gaining their
friendship and confidence. But so long as they were mourning bitterly for their mother and
could not conceal the sharpness of their grief, the sight of them was a torture to him. It
was a relief to him and to Mr. Clifford when they left Riversborough the next morning.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

AN EMIGRATION SCHEME.

Several months passed away, bringing no visitor to Riversborough, except Phebe, who came down
two or three times to see Mr. Clifford, whose favorite she was. But Phebe never spoke of the
past to Jean Merle. Since they had determined what to do, it seemed wiser to her not to look
back so as to embitter the present. Jean Merle was gradually gaining a footing in the town
as Mr. Clifford's representative, and was in many ways filling a post very few could fill.
Now and then, some of the elder townsmen, who had been contemporary with Roland Sefton, remarked
upon the resemblance between Jean Merle and their old comrade; but this was satisfactorily
accounted for by his relationship to Madame Sefton: for Roland, they said, had always had a
good deal of the foreigner about him, much more than this quiet, melancholy, self-effacing
man, who never pushed himself forward, or courted attention, yet was always ready with a good
sound shrewd opinion if he was asked for it. It had been a lucky thing for old Clifford that
such a man had been found to take care of him and his affairs in his extreme old age.

Felix had gone back to his curacy, under Canon Pascal, in the parish where he had spent his
boyhood and where he was safe against any attack upon his father's memory. But in spite of
being able to see Alice every day, and of enjoying Canon Pascal's constant companionship, he
was ill at ease, and Phebe was dissatisfied. This was exactly the life Felicita had dreaded
for him, an easy, half-occupied life in a small parish, where there was little active employment
for either mind or body. The thought of it troubled and haunted Phebe. The magnificent physical
strength and active energy of Felix, and the strong bent to heroic effort and Christian devotion
given to him in his earliest years, were thrown away in this tranquil English village, where
there was clearly no scope for heroism. How was it that Canon Pascal could not see it? His
curacy was a post to be occupied by some feebler man than Felix; a man whose powers were only
equal to the quiet work of carrying on the labors begun by his rector. Besides, Felix would
have recovered from the shock of his mother's sudden death if his time and faculties had been
more fully occupied. She must give words to her discontent, and urge Canon Pascal to banish
him from a spot where he was leading too dull a life.

Canon Pascal had been in residence at Westminster for some weeks, and was about to return to
his rectory, when Phebe went down to the Abbey one day, bent upon putting her decision into
action. The bitterness of the early spring had come again; and strong easterly gales were blowing
steadily day after day, bringing disease and death to those who were feeble and ailing, yet
not more surely than the fogs of the city had done. It had been a long and gloomy winter, and
in this second month of the year the death rates were high. As Phebe passed through the Abbey
on her way to his home in the cloisters, she saw Canon Pascal standing still, with his head
thrown back and his eyes uplifted to the noble arches supporting the roof. He did not notice
her till her clear, pleasant voice addressed him.

"Ah, Phebe!" he exclaimed, a swift smile transforming his grave, marked face, "my dear, I was
just asking myself how I could bear to say farewell to all this."

He glanced round him with an expression of unutterable love and pride and of keen regret. The
Abbey had grown dearer to him than any spot on earth; and as he paced down the long aisle he
lingered as if every step he took was full of pain.

"Bid farewell to it!" repeated Phebe; "but why?"

"For a series of whys," he answered; "first and foremost, because the doctors tell me, and
I believe it, that my dear wife's days are numbered if she stays another year in this climate.
All our days are numbered by God, I know; but man can number them also, if he pleases, and
make them longer or shorter by his obedience or disobedience. Secondly, Phebe, our sons have
gone on before us as pioneers, and they send us piteous accounts of the spiritual needs of
the colonists and the native populations out yonder. I preach often on the evils of over-population
and its danger to our country, and I prescribe emigration to most of the young people I come
across. Why should not I, even I, take up the standard and cry 'Follow me'? We should leave
England with sad hearts, it is true, but for her good and for the good of unborn generations,
who shall create a second England under other skies. And last, but not altogether least, the
colonial bishopric is vacant, and has been offered to me. If I accept it I shall save the life
most precious to me, and find another home in the midst of my children and grand-children."

"And Felix?" cried Phebe.

"What could be better for Felix than to come with us?" he asked; "there he will meet with the
work he was born for, the work he is fretting his soul for. He will be at last a gallant soldier
of the Cross, unhampered by any dread of his father's sin rising up against him. And we could
never part with Alice--her mother and I. You would be the last to say No to that, Phebe?"

"Oh, yes!" she answered, with tears standing in her eyes, "Felix must go with you." 

Nothing would he pursued, there, too cognize as a train if them sat to brother had been given of thirty-nine,
