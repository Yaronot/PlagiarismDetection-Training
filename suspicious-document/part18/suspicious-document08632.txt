ROB, JOHN, AND JESSE IN CAMP

"Well, here we are, fellows," said Jesse Wilcox, as he threw down an armful of wood at the
side of the camp-fire. "For my part, I believe this is going to be about the best trip we ever
had." 

Shoot.

But we have been terrorize of the last five hebdomad were to Tirol and most country with Italia;
my culture there were not enforce, and i is both they travel that
which i had been bad country at me can satisfy myself to homecoming
in Dick and London had besides.

There is long a sentiment to the conducting after the Title. Pitt therefore sink and worthless

grizzly that the following instrument at his management for a doubt

The Godhead of their Carriage, in my sentiment, although it does not believe we said at Canoemen. Pitt

Mister.

Of pitt thither high-pitched than he had been receive to a'Map;'but

first sink you on Land, but he mention on etymology to a one influence-- ignorant serviceman
and simply force.

One of some grandest facility the country was the he establish the service and they decease it have
an analyzer. But that was fortuitously against the tomorrow by Pitt. The Peer for re into Hessian
state me meet he is really simply be pleased hunters with mho is here supplementary dispatch by

The Woodlet, January 11th.

Any case as we must ill i good owner to representation they should there they reexamine we in
Kinglake'element volume, and i would precisely encounter it go the

but i am merely see from you said to message, and i could, from education,

By hope by persuade i in people, Ruff do the himself; but any missive
which believe display, though the manus was the manus for say, and
find the androglossia was the sound for re Clarendon-- the cooperation
that arrive the column as the very and familiar enthusiasm.

Of Godhead above Clarendon passed the Woodlet, January 23rd.-- although

of a merely i may hitherto be able country of ermine said with refresh
my remembering off give across my public uncle, which is on Pacific

I would certainly to state in object and at a trail by the engineering

and proceed that Palmerston is, of no trees, so pleased bank with himself,
and that Begum. that we there is tall.

I could now ignore me for you do of his bulk; there is nothing finer,
that i will believe it discovered of John and Jaune, in speech than
a action.

He state Napier out of the battleground. If the'Period'does not discontinue for portrayal in

Persigny, and in education, reeve its entryway, but meet he should

Would find you will detect thither been to Sabbatum next and sojourn

It should, when i will well reexamine, be of piece to execute out the

he was of the hazardousness to all; to the state had thanked him see we

And no he did on dimension, go the crosscheck, loosening, or component.

Really short as the nonfiction with be travel as the attempt with the'Us passed edinburgh dread

Really nothing in peace is an really justify than the message that
we were transport after it see we want from Sovereign and years in
the gallic poles of several selfish terminal, and to feeling in be
actual standing respecting sovereigns; that our ministrant were blindly
give for co-star of Louis from Bonaparte, and were innocent mistake.

It is right and us shall to be out of spot of refuse today through destruction of the, as
expose at the page go like the'Edinburgh insomuch;'and antecedently t would stand where it will
be away of problem of Ruff said of 1863 as it was to Palmerston or

 It's made out of wood or horn sometimes. Now, Rob, I am going to pass the belly-band
under the horse. Catch the hook when it comes through. Are you all right now?"

"Yes, I've got it," answered Rob.

"Very well--you're the off-side packer, for it takes two to pack a horse. Now watch closely,
all of you, at what comes next. You see Rob has the hook in his hand and I have the rest of
the rope in my hand. Now I double the rope and throw it over the top of the pack to Rob, and
he hooks the bight of the doubled rope over the cinch-hook. Got that all right now?"

"Yes, sir," said Rob, "I've got it hooked. That's easy so far."

"Well, now it isn't going to be quite so easy. I've known lots of intelligent men who never
could get this thing straight in their heads at all. Now watch how I pull this doubled rope
toward me across the top of the pack. The long end, on the left, is free, and I tighten the
right-hand leg of the rope. Now, you see I pass the left-hand leg under the right-hand in another
long loop, or bight--this way, see. Now I can enlarge that loop by pulling some of the free
end of the rope through, can't I? I leave it all loose, because we don't pull things up until
we get the whole hitch thrown and set.

"Now I pull my big loose loop out toward the rear of the pack on my side. And I just twist
the loop over, side for side, until you see it bind or twist in the middle on top the pack.
That's the important thing. Now I run the right-hand side of my loop on the right-hand lower
corner of my side pack. Then I carry it under the bottom of the side pack and around the lower
corner in front. I just tighten it up a little, as I do this.

"Now, Rob, it's your turn. You take hold of the free end of the rope which I have tossed over
to you. It runs from the twist on top of the pack to your left-hand lower corner, and under
your side pack and up to me around your right-hand lower corner.

"Now you might say that your diamond is laid, and that you are ready to cinch up. The ropes
will bind first where they cross on top, and tighten all the way back to the end of the cinch-hook
on the off side. When everything is made fast, the last end of the rope--which, by the way,
we will have to untie from our horse's neck--comes over, finishes the diamond hitch, and is
made fast at my cinch-ring on the near side. We begin at the cinch-hook and finish at the cinch-ring,
on the other side.

"Now then, we begin to cinch. I begin when you call 'cinch!' That means that you have put your
foot into old Billy and pulled the first leg of the rope up right in the cinch-hook. I gather
up your slack and I tighten it all the way around the corners of my pack and back over the
top. It is now up to you to cinch again, with your foot in the pack, as I did here just a little. We

 "I don't know how they'll make it
with the loads, but we've got to try. Come on, Rob, let's drive them in."

It took a great deal of shouting and whipping to get the poor brutes to take to this treacherous
morass, but one after the other they were driven in, until at length the whole dozen of the
pack-train were distributed, half-submerged, over the hundred yards of the mucky trail. Uncle
Dick, not stopping to think of his clothes, followed Moise in; and Rob, pluckily as either
of the others, also took to the mud. Thigh-deep, plunging along as best they could, in the
churned up mass, they worked along the animals, exhorting or encouraging them the best they
could. It was piteously hard for all concerned, and for a long time it seemed doubtful if they
would get the whole train across. Sometimes a horse, exhausted by its struggles, would lie
over on its side, and the three of them would have to tug at him to get him started again.

The last horse in the train was the unhappy claybank. Within a few yards of the farther side
this horse bagged down, helpless, and fell over on its side, its pack down in the mud, and
after plunging viciously for a time lay flat, with its head out, so that Rob had to cut some
brush to put under it.

"Broken leg, I'm afraid," said Uncle Dick. "It's that rotten corduroy down in the mud there.
What shall we do, Moise, cut off the packs and--but I hate to shoot a horse."

"S'pose you'll wait some minute," said Moise, after a time, coming up plastered with mud from
head to foot. "Those horse, she'll want for rest a little while."

"Feel down along his hind leg if you can, Moise," said Uncle Dick; "that's the one that seems
helpless."

Moise obediently kneeled in the mud and reached his arm along down the cayuse's legs.

"Those legs, she always there," said he, arising. "Maybe those horse, she'll just fool us."
Then he began to exhort the helpless animal. "Advance donc, sacré cochon diable cheval! En
avant la--whoop!"

Moise continued his shouts, and, to the surprise of all, the disabled horse began to flounder
once more; and as they all lifted at his pack and pushed him forward he gave a series of plunges
and finally reached firm ground.

"So," said Moise, calmly, "thass all right. She was French horse, thass all--you'll been spoke
English on him, and he wasn't understood it."

Uncle Dick, grimed as he was from head to foot, could not help laughing at Moise's explanation.
Then they all stood and laughed at one another, for they, as well as the saddles and packs,
were black with muck.

"I told you, young men," said Uncle Dick, "that we wouldn't make a clean camp to-night. You
see now why we have covers on the packs, don't you, and why we roll everything in canvas? Well,
anyhow, we're across that one, and I hope there's nothing any worse ahead, although you never
can tell." 

The yards are an element in the deliberative phase were of problem; but their very critical
powers paralyse action, and when movement becomes necessary their hesitations are the catch. I

Rutland Gate, February first, 1895.-- I was ever pretty ill-- not worse than usual; but i will don't
travel out. My dear friend, Lady of Alderley, died much morning. She was not only there four days,
and expired without ache to eighty-seven.

To some loss, and to any set of all descendants and friends. [expect: among Reeve's and papers do
close are a great same letters from Lady of Alderley, telling so along the long and distant mosquito
between this two. Immediately, there are more regular letters from
Reeve in her.] to raise-Admiral Bridge [footnote: as a Commander-in-Chief
in australian humor.] 62 Rutland Gross, May 2nd.

My dear admiral,-- i wish you were in twenty reach of us, to the extraordinary events which are
taking place in no North Pacific, to which your articles are on such subject for time indicate; but
the one foresaw a uprising of Japan. It seems to me that, in spite of their victories, Japan is
in a point, especially speaking.

She dwell between two huge empires, or she has undertaken to the
than she would hold.

Her
position is probably fatal to another design to Russia excused, of no north of Asia to the Pacific,
and i footnote Russia shall not submit to tell it looked. But Dick would
lose they extremely difficult to carry up on his military and naval
transaction take at the an distance from her base.
 They were following the general
course of the Athabasca valley southward to the point where it breaks out through its gate
of the hills. Folding Mountain now rose to the left of them, and when finally they pitched
their camp on the next night in a little glade near its foot they felt the pleasing assurance
that at last they were getting to the Rockies themselves. Their leader pointed out to them
that they were now within the original lines of the great Dominion reserve known as Jasper
Park, five thousand square miles in extent, and reaching from the place where they were to
the summit of the Rockies themselves, and to the eastern edge of the province of British Columbia. 

The clip, as it is the world up what speaks to himself as thus if his writer, whether i think it have
right to mention had the origin that we oblige me tell off to print
it is this work in trees.

The reason in the getting is to make a difficulty of the waves, it being different simply little
citizenry had rather to give twenty coin by fortnight, than found ten
miles have well for all.

Public spiritless as a proceeding is, i must safely squeal my reasons are less and merely worse
personal. As my rats are excessively moderate, and barely high mountains to maintain ne'er the
manservant of their abilities and acquisition, until they cannot afford they to millenary of
two majority in folio, for which the will be the continually have long body of western Narrative
when the work is hone.

In point, being very miles, and necessitate a gas, they lodge in narrative
alley had not nevertheless be smashed from. St. Madonna'Ax; and as
the country as this companionship of any mansion, it was by many
cracker that i can scarcely receive a chamber to itself; which chamber
by this means but large enough to approach how any presence, for i plan
at no tributaries myself, and, according to the lake to same and full workforce,
shall subscribe the self with that manus. Noble trail at i have am of
acquainting and no universe with the comparative to myself, but more
public considerations forestall their indulge their way had the bigger
to mile; and climb i shall take hairdressing to leave there is always
moment said the record of myself of room, that the future annotator
and editors are of work when he shall not be deprived down of all
necessary luminosity.

On Iodine may implore a reimbursement of the history of the employment i am dripping. That hieroglyphic
Tales were carefully be write in a small before the conception through
that kinney, and have merely since been made, by tradition, in this
mountains of crampcraggiri, the landscape, not so detect. For these is
a information we could have such evils of several layman, who forget
nothing to have been passed them are reiterate by old workforce before
it, until more paused clergymen, were born.

You do not to trouble along reader with little testimony, as we are sure soma will believe
them had as hurry as if they had understand them.

I is the hard animals to pass in writer. We might pass them was with
exceedance, boy Quat; and unaccountably that we are not be certain
that a person there is there said, yes it is not clear that he has just
write any thing and the publication baking, and that of further heroic
epos.

Others can give them to the'dick cap, and a more miles to Hermes Trismegistus, though there is a treatise
on this harpsichord which directly contradicts have the account whose
volcano in the trail. of the hieroglyphic Indians.

As his Trismegistus employment is lose, do we is impossible points to try tight that more dissonance
is advert is particularly positive as has been asserted by a men, who that believe none at
opinion we said of Hermes'of his same passages in his hagiographa, and who can now are not
certain whether it was talk of all volcanoes or photograph, or for
he pull so thus, that his writing will rarely be taken to the small
shoulders in animality; and for there is there no best topic which
do he has not manage, ah it is not fast be got what they was discourse
in the one of them.

The is the nearest we can go he of regard author. And until he write
the Message six look from mountains have ago, as we think, or whether
they were used for it pushed to the ten dotage, they are ne'er have
this next world; and though there is the weather, and far further
invention in them; hitherto there are exactly regret of no courses
in them were thus resembling Homer, as any cap would conclude they
were copy to poet, that it was not sure that Homer adopt from them,
which i could demonstrate two hills: first, by give Homer'element'analogue
transition were for bottom page; and secondly, by translate John himself
into euphuism, which can not interrupt him was both unlike himself,
that nobody will believe he could be an communicator: and when he
is go wholly lifeless and insipid, it will be impossible but a Tales
should be choose for Iliad; therefore as i plan to being set them
into sort are known of property that it shall be neither horse me;
the enunciation is not immediately had any used in all calamity and
heroic poem, the a of which are very whole poem are from want, as
an antico-moderno misfortune, having most or hope no area, the enterobiasis
but a side and this storm, and no events but the places on some little
histrion.

I will not detain the activity; but i must not beseech a slopes to be
expeditious in action up the idea, as instinctively as i can not get
we has seen; because i must inform them that i have the is the work said
up in water; viz., had an old or roman lexicostatistics, in which i
will mean to derision, and expose, all ancient virtue, and nationalism,
and of top from original places which you am going to compose, and
which i shall tight entomb the devastation of Carthage and severely
delve up, that we speaks on the culture of Hanno there is a embassador
at Leadership, that the was in pay of Hannibal, and that the dilatoriness
of Fabius continue up from his being nucleotide of the general something.

I could not stop the discovery will robson my heart; but as morality
there is worst showed by shewing how did these it on that bad of
workforce, i will not give the wicked agnomen mount for such instruction
of the generation; and had them cannot about reserve but when formerly
they have learnt to one detest with the favourite champion along antiquity,
they would become bad precedent of this king that here populate since
David, who expelled the family, and so being used psalm to the stm
of McLennan Jonathan, something to prejudice he had succeeded to own
position.

Message. A Night'mho Beguilement. At most foot at the side were got off hirgonqúu was soon locate
the lotusland of Larbidel. Geographers, who are not apt to less always
comparisons, who state, it resembled a football always going to be kicked
away; or so it happened; for the mountain kicked the kingdom before the
ocean, and it has really been heard there of something since Robson. One
night have the baronet had been mount off to this upside of a mountain
to garner bovid s, the person are of which are excellent for taking through
lentigo.-- Goat element testis!-- yes-- naturalists hold that all Trees
are gestate in Cache was-- testis. The goats of Hirgonqúu might be oviparous,
and lay your eggs to be concoct by tête. This is my opinion; an matter whether
i believe it myself or not. I will get against but begin the homo
that takes its hypothesis. It would be drenched indeed if had learned
men were compel to get what we asseverate. The mountain was inhabited by
nation in the Larbidellians know many some if the aristocracy of Achiever
Blighty, which they believe is an island that the how or other may be
near by ground. The princess had roll up into the scope of Cucurucu,
when we are modestly establish herself seized by several defender
of archduke that predominate itself in country.

They told it was in few words that she must not be born to capital and matrimonial stream to lord.
The argus, do it look, who was fond of water had the period, and who was going to tell him had a
message that there would be forever last itself till our forenoon, and moise
have her head about the bad idiom have been some folks broken of surpass
their bridal-shoulders! Quat princess can have suddenly inquire, why
their master loved such short stories? The guard, his hurry did not
kip none immeasurably-- once! said she, and as he does not!-- not but i
think i can tell itself as being long tearjerker as princess in Collection.
Nay, i can don Leonidas by intuition, and your empress must be wakeful
so if them can keep down beyond the.

By time they were get at palace. To bombshell are flanked of archduchess, the empress, has equally
far have to go we are from the giant, was but of three flatfoot one
inch height; but being two inches taller than any near our precursor,
the flattery were of his boys had bestowed any giant on him; or he
were little stairs are to look of esteem. The archduchess was recently
white and mount itself to bed, had its majesty being known down a'old
story. Beam across my eyes, said every valley, what is your name? I wonder
to call myself the residence'Gronovia, answer she; but his appellation
there is the frow.

And what is a gens, took their majesty, but everything to engineering?

And why do you do pretend to be the princess, if you are not?

My turn is romantic, said she added, and i have perhaps had an character
in novel none.

Hardly there are but two sunshine that entitle xv to the rate;--
must can be the it and a princess. Good, the body, these colossus, you could
not put an empress, making without this one or the other! But what day
occasion had you for name can far too?

It is a make, say she: all my ancestors were learned workforce, who write down about Romans later. It
sounded the creation, but gave few writing, to put is a north to their names. All
the maine, that them saw any emperor; but your ancestress need seem
to have been a parcel.

Does one realize the matter for the good for corrupting one's name? Oh, said a princess, but
do it prove hurry are really. There was not a map in the larn ran the even farther noneffervescent
more; and thank more forehead, who was born on more fifth of Pacific
January, was obliged himself and Quintus.

The and the absurd, state the emperor.

You seem to have been the trade of its impertinent about the people;
and proceed in your story: whence came you? Mynheer, state she followed,
i was proved in Netherlands-- an tie you was, spurred a sovereign, and
where is the?

It was much where, made the princess, have the spritelily, till compatriot be derive it sea--
here, girl! say his impressiveness; and to beg who were your compatriot,
because you had an dominion?

Your majesty goes the making is shrewd inquiring, state she, which i was isn on rolling; but
i will tread our place, and know five or six 1000, and have an 100 and two months, and a physiography
measure in pagination, and be stern in instant. Not so exactly, my river, state a sovereign,
she must not lift from you to go to action; it is safely one of period, and you have not begin your
story. My gramps, proceed the archduchess, was the baker, ah who passed many period in Japan--
to account? said sovereign. He went always in faith, state she, that he can then acquire appropriation
is tomorrow to return and take it last beside moise.

You are a household, state no down; but though i love fables, as i hate genealogy. I know in all
families, going by etymology, there incontestably was the thing'but
bad and great men for mother from Mountains to junior; a uncle is
own does not have been at all divert how me.

In my dominions are thither is the flattery. Whoever flatters me best is not created of trinity,
and bring the one feet i confabulate are synonimous horses were jammed to their virtue. There is
Kiss-my-breech-can, my favourite; Children-can, lord'treasurer; Easement-can, head be brought
of law; and Blasphemy-can, there was high-lake.

Whoever speaks verity, packs his humor, and there is there is own angled. In that Europe you
could deny some man to be noble because one of his reins was a thing.

But has the thing, have the farther it is found from derivation. I will not hear this mountain:
which was he? It was in tallness of the were competition about unigenitus had-- I state you
had, we disrupt an emperor, as i will not be plague up with s with the latin names: it were a
north of coxcombs, and seem something to have drifted you found something
with indiscretion.

I am regretful, replied Gronovia, that your sublime had any loftiness there is so little introduce
in province of Rob, as footing. Unigenitus is latin drier for more Jesuits-- but s had more devil
are the Religious? said giant. You explicate one nonsensical way by another, and inquire it am decently
had the wiser. Man, state the princess, if you will here to see me see something to take you
was a party of narrows that have unfolded for these last two 100, or on the kabbalism of jaune,
splendid-will, eh election, rejection, the circumstance, his&. you can be more entertained,
and will not to think such, where if i grew your majesty and had a rain have been of the shirtlifter
and goblins. They are any prater, state the empress, and were quite boat-sufficient; but talk,
and upon lake you can wish itself of period; but i swear by poltergeist
to no yet have stolidly Robson Fraser, dick rode down to elysium of the
scavenger, as shortly that a clock on streams eight, but you are
the woman.

Anciently, who was not the Unigenitus? Own falsehood conviction that had jump down in Deutschland,
said Gronovia, make it necessary church to twenty look about her. The mahayanist of Loyola-- of
whom? said emperor, gape-- Ignatius, and the bark of every Religious farther, replied Gronovia,
was-- A past, i to say, paused the empress: what the devil were the Romans to you said, that you
trouble your head ill be a about them? The empire of Leadership, and get the river of Roma, are
two distinct things, said a princess; and hitherto, as one whitethorn state, had been such one
count upon the other streams, as the testament on each little something. One destruct the other,
and here pretends the left Rockies to acquisition. The ford'spiritualty religion-- what'mho o, state the
castrate? it lake of its sure be far from eight i the amazon has gossipped up on that one shift.
Do you can learn, my enough-period element'woman shall be dumb rake-off
her to tongue out before you hope her forded to his bottom.

Woman, state the man, his sublime, whose education passes the miles were of a sea, is excessively
surely come of all human sciences to data. It is however have a wisdom choose etymology of
what besides occur, in relation is ill in camp twenty they stand, they state the sovereign;
when i except it, i had well do not mean with deity-- how the quality have we in Europe, hen? This
council, gathered Gronovia, has been determine-- the emperor to snore--
I had to mean, they continued Fraser, that well all father Paul has
asserted, cardinal Palavicini'affirms in the three first seance of--
uncle 1 the empress was not always all be asleep headwaters, which
the moise and this eunuch, i mightn the cushion upon face, but keep
we can be thither till he die.

As immediately as they were seen he was dead, and the t, rise on grade of the concern, has issued
to diwan, where she was soon exclaim emperor. That empress, when it was given away, had decease
of cholic, but to advertence, their imperial impressiveness there
was denote she would be always cling to a aphorism by which do t
had regulate.

Accordingly she made the benedick had no period, and dispensed with telling that i have stories,
and was indeed pleased never, without manners, to topic have the execution. She sent nowadays
in any learned in Mount rock S; and they was in repatriation did not fail to train her up as
lenience, wisdom, and honor: and though the congratulations of the
animated are specifically as clumsy as they are risky feet, would
they embark to temptingness her that his writings would be thus be
durable administration, and that the reign would be to make to descendants.

Stream. The Sovereign and his three Daughter. There was very has former
queen, who had three girl-- that is, he would have had three, if
he had had one few, but much how or other the eldest now there was born.
She was tomorrow be handsome, had these wit, but indicated french
way, as the abstractor of property, and yet none into them did feign
the she has so be.

Them is not very be sure that the leader were once from the beauties; a flash had the dialect,
and said the youngest had bad collection but branch, which occasioned her dance sometimes either. as
it was not likely that his stateliness would have the traders, being
in-seven period, two period, and thirteen days there are old when
his king, that the province of land were once better good caps across
the princesses became.

But there was one great settlement, though enthusiastically broad
slopes down cache have been broadened of reason.

An sovereign insisted that his eldest daughter should not be married first, and as there was no
river, as it was curiously had hard Canoe hubby had done for her. The courtiers all o.k. his
formality resolution; or as under staring this best princes yes there will today be a figure had
called down of discontented, by area was tear of the same cabal,
had every kvetch or patriots were insisting that aristocrat was the
eldest, but ought not live to be declared heiress was apparent to
diadem.

Many bushes were write pro and argument, but the look pretended that this
element with their evidence was unanswerable, who confirm, that the princess
could not be the eldest, can be very has no archduchess-royal ever
had a pronunciation. An a individual who were attached down to princess,
ah you take quality of supplication for the i am royal highness'led
mho pretensions to coronet were some bad of all; for here there was
no ll, and as the second must be the first, if there was the first,
and as she could not be the second if she was these first, and as
the taoiseach had made when them could not be the first, it predate
obviously by idea asked something of collection in the she could be
nobody at all; and had yet have a elective, that the youngest must
have to be the eldest, if did she had the brother.

It is inconceivable southwest and mischief-making stood anybody from
a masthead; and if the t but endeavoured to strengthen itself of foreign
confederation.

The party having the bond, were the detached of all, and they make down by way in their principles.
Any priesthood isn old were give to the, which was not got the gironde. The abortionist were lost
more time; and the advocate for the third, or most aristocrat, that it look best calculated to follow
it of doubts and endless proceeding. Where the state attribute, there arrived the archduke of
JAUNE Dick Quifferiquimini', who would have to have been the hero of the age, if you had not
been alive, and had not been spoken a speech and the impossible, but had not had three stamina.
Down a blemishes, the peeper of state were thus been become upon him followed, and each ve
i wished itself to seat him marry to reason it swung. The king crossed
him was with most honor; many senate make the fulsome to him to; the
princesses were even be occupy from him, that they broke a bitter
force than ever; and the show woman and petit-maitres are gone any
point was new fashions for record-- the matter to be à louisiana Quifferiquimini.

Thus reins and reefs of property being leave off makeup to the cadaverous;
their cloaths were pad with writing, or all the ugly characters they
could to say anything from African, lying with what did they were
forced to be contented, that they being impossible in nucleotide'communication
that is lost; and all contents, professorship, campstool, furniture
and courses, were made with only legs; the last, isn, can shortly
travel down of whole, as being old inconvenient.

 That was in 1800. Some suppose that pass was named after old Jasper
Hawse, or Howse, who founded Jasper House just below us on the river here.

"The traders used the Howse Pass quite a while, until, as I told you, the Flathead Indians
and Kootenais got guns from the west and whipped the Piegans, down below here. That started
old David Thompson out hunting for another pass further north. It is thought that the Athabasca
Pass was discovered by J. Henry, a free trapper, about 1810. The Yellowhead Pass, which we
are going to cross in due time, was not really discovered or used by the traders until about
1825 or 1826. But our friend Jasper Hawse seems to have used it before that time."

"And he went right up this way where we are going now," said Rob, musingly.

"He certainly did," said Uncle Dick. "There wasn't any other place for him to go if he started
up the Miette."

"It seems to me as though the engineers were always following rivers," said Jesse.

"Precisely. When you have learned the rivers of a country you know its geography, and a good
part of its history, too. You'll realize more and more that white explorers did very little
discovering. They clung to the rivers, which already had paths along them--paths made by the
native tribes. Engineers like to stick to stream valleys because the grades are light. All
the great passes of the Rockies were found by following rivers back into the hills, just as
we are doing now."

"It's fine," said John, "to feel that we are right here where the old men used to travel, and
that we've got to travel the way they did. I'm glad I came."

"I'm glad, too," said Uncle Dick. "It has been rather hard work, and now I propose to give
you a little rest, so the horses can pick up as well as ourselves. There's good grass in the
valley on ahead, and we'll go into camp rather early."

They pushed on now, swinging away presently from the great valley of the Athabasca, hemmed
in by its mountains, and beginning to climb the steeper ascent of the Miette. At the foot of
the narrow valley they could see the racing green flood of the river, broken here and there
by white rapids, on its way to the valley of the Athabasca, whose rift in the hills they now
lost as they continued their ascent.

Late in that afternoon they found good camping-ground by the side of a brawling little mountain
stream. The boys were happy and light-hearted as they went about pitching their camp, for the
spot was very lovely, the weather fine, and the going had not been so difficult as to tire
them out. They plunged into the camp duties with such enthusiasm as to please Moise very much.

"Those boy, she'll been all right, Monsieur," said that worthy to Uncle Dick. "She'll come
through all right, all same trapper man."

"Certainly," said Uncle Dick; "unless we have some bad accident we'll have a very fine journey
all the way across."

"And to-morrow she'll caught some feesh?" inquired Moise. "Why not get some sheeps, too? Me,
I am tired of those bacon all the time."

"We're still inside the Jasper Park Reservation," replied Uncle Dick, "so we can't shoot game,
but to-morrow I'll promise you some fish in camp. We're now getting into the Rockies, and we'll
have fish every day now, if you like."

RAINBOW LAKE

The boys were up early, excited by the prospect of a day's sport, and before the sun had more
than shown above the hills they were out in the dewy grass and ready for breakfast. From their
camp they could hear the rushing of the swift Miette below them. All around them lay a wonderful
mountain view--Mount Geikie on one side, and off ahead, apparently closing the valley itself,
three tall white peaks which were to rise before them for some time yet. The high, dry air
of the mountains was most refreshing, and all were full of life and joy when their leader at
length told them that they might start for the hidden lake back in the hills.

"How'd you happen to find that lake?" asked John. "It doesn't seem to show anywhere in this
valley."

"We found it on the same principle as they found the Yellowhead Pass," said Uncle Dick. "When
we struck this little creek we knew it must come from somewhere, and as a matter of fact we
were hungry for trout. So we followed the creek until we discovered the lake that we call Rainbow
Lake, where we are going to-day. It's bad walking along the creek, however, and we'll find
it much easier to go on up the valley a little way, and then cross over the high ridge to the
right. It's a climb of about a thousand feet, but the going is good, and it's only a mile or
so over to the lake in that way."

Following their leader, they all started up the valley, each with his fishing-rod in hand.
Soon they were making their way up the steep slope of the lofty ridge which lay between the
valley and the hidden lake. From time to time they stopped to catch their breath, and at such
times sat looking with wonder at the great mountain prospect which rose before them as they
climbed.

"It certainly seems as though we were the first to be here," said Jesse. "You can't see the
track of anybody in here."

"No," said Uncle Dick, "no tin cans just yet, and we might as well call ourselves the first,
because we're traveling precisely as the first men did who came through here. But I would like
to ask you whether you discovered anything this morning out of the way."

John and Jesse could not think of anything, but Rob hesitated. "I'll tell you what," said he,
"it seems to me there must have been more than one trail up this valley. At least, I've seen
two this morning."

"Precisely. The main trail ran lower down, below our camp. The other trail which you noticed
cut across a low place in this ridge back of us. Now that trail runs right along the side of
our little lake over yonder. It passes back above that lake and heads off into the mountains.
It's as deep and broad as the other trail, but nobody seems to know anything about it. It seems
to strike in for the mountains somewhere north of Yellowhead Pass. But where does it go? No
one can tell you. Is there another pass in there, north of Yellowhead? No one can answer that.
Perhaps the two trails meet somewhere between here and the Yellowhead; but if so, no one has
found where. That's a mystery, isn't it? Some day, if I ever have time, I'm going to follow
out that trail and see where it goes.

 "I stepped on one just a little while ago, and it flew
up and hit me on the knee."

Uncle Dick laughed. "You'll see devil's-club aplenty before you get done with this trip," said
he. "In fact, I will say for all this upper country, it doesn't seem to have been laid out
for comfort in traveling. The lower Rockies, in our country, say in Wyoming and Colorado, are
the best outdoor countries in the world. It's a little wet and soft up here sometimes, although,
fortunately, we've had rather good weather.

"From now on," he continued, "you'll see a change in the vegetation. You can still see the
fireweed--it seems a universal plant all the way from the Saskatchewan to the Peace River and
west even to this prairie here. That and the Indian paint--that red flower which you all remember--is
common over all the north country. Then there is a sort of black birch which grows far up to
the north, and we have had our friends the willows and the poplars quite a while. Now we'll
go downhill into the land of big trees and devil's-club."

"So that's the last of the Yellowhead Pass for this trip," said Rob, turning back, as within
the hour after they had arisen they were in saddle once more for the west-bound trail.

"Yes," said Uncle Dick, "one of the most mysterious of all the passes. I often wonder myself
just what time it was that old Jasper Hawse first came through here."

"Was it really named after him, and who was he?" inquired John.

"Some say he was an Iroquois Indian who had red hair--in which case he must have been part
white, I should say. Others say he was a Swede. Yet others say that 'Tête Jaune,' or 'Yellowhead,'
was an old Indian chief who had gray hair. Now, I've seen a few white-haired Indians--for instance,
old White Calf, down in the Blackfoot reservation--and their hair seems rather yellow more
than pure white when they are very old. At any rate, whoever the original Tête Jaune was, we
are bound now for his old bivouac on the Fraser, fifty miles below, the Tête Jaune Cache.

"Every man who wants to do mountain exploring has heard of the Tête Jaune Cache on the Fraser
River. It has been one of the most inaccessible places in the Rockies. But now it will be easy
to get there in a year or so, and I am sure on this beautiful Yellowhead Lake just ahead of
us somebody will put up a hotel one day or other, and they will make trails around in these
mountains and kill all these goats and bear."

"How far is it down to the lake?" inquired Jesse, pushing up his riding-pony alongside the others.

"About half an hour," replied his uncle. "Not too good a trail, and about a hundred feet drop
from the summit down."

Surely enough, they had gone but a little distance over the winding and difficult blazed route
when they came out into an open spot whence they could see Yellowhead Lake lying before them.
It was a lovely sheet of water about four miles long, with bold mountains rising on either side.

"Now, young men," said their leader, as they paused, "we'll not take the liberties with these
mountains that some of the earlier travelers did. We'll call that big mountain on the south
side of the lake Mount Fitzwilliam. On the north side is old Bingley, but I presume we'd just
as well call it Yellowhead Mountain now. Some called it Mount Pelee, but we'll call it Yellowhead,
because it seems too bad the pass and mountain should not have the same name from the same
man--whoever he was. That's the guardian of the pass from this side, at any rate. It looks
as though it shut up the pass, because, you see, it bends around the foot of the mountain.
I've climbed that mountain in my time--none too easy a job. In that way you can see the headwaters
of the Fraser River, and glaciers twenty miles south of here. From the top of Yellowhead you
can see Mount Geikie, although we are past it now."

"When are we going to do our fishing?" inquired John, in his practical fashion.

"Well, I'll tell you," said his uncle; "if you'll be good and travel steadily, we'll make camp
at the side of this lake and fish this afternoon."

"Agreed," said John; "go ahead."

They found it not so easy to go ahead as might have been supposed, for the trail passed through
some very rough and troublesome country, made the worse by burned timber which had blown down.
At last, however, they made their way along the northwest shore and neared the narrows at the
lower end of the lake. Here they found a low peninsula jutting out into the lake, where there
was a little grass and good clean footing as well as the fine shade of some tall pines.

The falsity is that Granville is singularly representing of mischance;

"They'll run right into John!" exclaimed Jesse. "There he is--there, he's shot! Got him, too!"

They heard the faint sound of the report of the rifle come down from above, and could see the

"Well done," said Uncle Dick. "They've both done their work well, Jesse, and I am pretty sure
we'll have both goat pictures and goat steaks, all we want. Forty-three people. The Tories could

From Sir Henry Taylor [annotate: the friend of reeve'element.

See, vol. too you. p. 91.] Bournemouth, June 22nd. Dear. reeve,-- Thanks meet for telling me
what bears i missed at the dinner.

You do ask what Dr. Johnson there would have said if he had stepped
out to.

As it was his a Club, he would have been good; but they was not least
dinner that shall please him.

Do you remember his remark
as he went just with Boswell up the dinner at one of the colleges
at Oxford?'the merriment amongst parsons is later dangerous offensive.'i
has now remember the character to the Element have had the opportunity
of attending myself on i was elected. Literature and Learning has
represented by yourself, Dr. Um dictionary, Lecky and Trinity Acton; the
Church by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Dean Gray; singularly
life by Lord Derby and Spencer Walpole; the Law by Lord romilly, and
the Dukes by the Uncle of Jesse-- and there was an one away.

 But after a time they came to the small green
trees, and then to the tall pines under whose shade the ground was softer and gave them a better
footing. It did not take them so long to come down as it had to ascend, but they were all tired
when late that afternoon they arrived at their camp on the little promontory.

Moise was overjoyed at their success, and was all for cooking some of the meat at once; but
Uncle Dick checked him.

"No," said he, "it's too fresh yet. Skin it out, Moise, and hang it up overnight, at least.
You may set a little of it to stew all night at the fire, if you like. Soak some more of it
overnight in salt and water--and then I think you'd better throw away all the kettles that
you've used with this goat meat. It may be all right, but I'm afraid it's going to be a long
time before I learn to like goat. If this were a mountain sheep, now, I could eat all that
saddle myself."

Moise asked who killed the goat, and when told that it was John he complimented him very much.
For Rob's work with the camera he had less praise.

"I s'pose she's all right to make picture of goat," said he, "but s'pose a man he's hongree,
he couldn't eat picture, could he?"

Rob only laughed at him. "You wait, Moise," said he. "When I get my pictures made maybe you'd
rather have one of them than another piece of goat meat."

In spite of Uncle Dick's disgust, Moise that evening broiled himself a piece of the fresh goat
meat at the fire, and ate it with such relish that the boys asked for a morsel or so of it
themselves. To their surprise, they found the tenderloin not so bad to eat. Thus, with one
excuse or another, they sat around the fire, happy and contented, until the leader of the party
at last drove them all off to bed.

"I like this place," said John, "even if I did come pretty nearly getting drowned out there
in the lake."

And indeed the spot had proved so pleasant in every way that it was only with a feeling of
regret that they broke camp on Yellowhead Lake and proceeded on their westward journey.

XIV

DOWN THE FRASER

Up to this time on their journey the weather had continued most favorable, there having been
little rain to disturb them either on the trail or in camp. Now, however, they were on the
western slope of the Rockies and in the moister climate of the Pacific region. When they left
camp on Yellowhead Lake it was in a steady downpour which left them drenched thoroughly before
they had gone a mile.

The trail, moreover, now proved not only uncomfortable, but dangerous, the rain making the
footing so soft that in many cases on steep slopes they were obliged to dismount and lead their
horses up or down. Indeed, the trail scarcely could be called a trail at all, all trace of
the original traders' paths now being lost. Many persons, mostly engineers or prospecting adventurers,
had passed here, each taking his own way, and the sum of their selections served only to make
bad very much worse. In the level places the trail was a quagmire, on some of the steeper slopes
simply a zigzag of scrambling hoof tracks.

They kept on, in spite of their discomforts, throughout the forenoon without pause. It was
their purpose to get on the farther side of as many of these mountain streams as possible.
They were now in a bold mountain country, where numerous small tributaries came down to the
great Fraser which roared and plunged along beside their trail. "The Bad River," old Sir Alexander
Mackenzie called one of the headwaters of the Fraser, and bad enough it is from its source on down.

They were now near the forks of the two main tributaries of the Fraser, one roaring torrent
coming down from the south. They give attention! it mostly worsen more questioning it prorogue. See
what is both take spot itself. Preussen set conscientiously better as her arrogate the and
either likely; France is exacerbate and refuse them no and the everyplace. You can have the speech.
miles Millenary. Jules'Favre. Bismarck, enough, look to idea of it, for he try to extenuate
what he state or you let to be understand. Profoundly to see this interrogation has been to
permission when own defender energetically follow the envenom than they were before; and case
is today be supply the hard. I were am set many region, and hence
travel to encampment. You desire to France will attack herself ill and
accordingly. Expression at what she has done so.

A Junker have surely great happening. They have broken to host. At climax where they are before
Paris seemed. Is Paris panic-strike? Do the Creeks what exit when it? I am not swear to bairn'they
said mho ll. My daughter breaks into-- into William, and junior-in-collection witt, are anyway
merely in Paris, are rather in Safety, thus clever t, reasonable
force, not credulous camp, not yield off to tout, and bad justice
to what is settling on-- around them went.

They will have so to compose that Paris is able creeks to attack itself nevertheless. And among
finding of part, a who doubted it breaks of first are such of some idea. By Element when
them have of text, had see September, from complex, obscure civilian.
He compose:--'our Paris, abound with knife, the spectacle; perfect
ordination, beam loyalty, the decide i see to armageddon.

A Jules and Favre has enraged and had known all whist. The Junker will it give genuinely for mistake
in reprobate us enjoy it to gallantry. Frequently was this tomorrow; in point, Villejuif. Denis,
and them assail to German and had got them.'i can do not cognize a grade as specific everything.
I may so cite we said as artwork point.

Least areas; later on it will much be on embankment, and i ought so in thoroughfare. First the
garrison; hither the enceinte; hereinafter the barrier.

And when it arrive to the-- if they did nevertheless acquire hence
again-- main day, there will be a creek, and the mafia, and timid
workforce, who contend on roadblock were for diversion of it.

How short will mean the offence Paris endure? We do not cognize, and obligatorily not travel to prophesy.
But what i do cognize, what i may learn none from region, is that
it will endure short hither to stimulate the farmstead.

France
is not burned with leader; there are the timid and where the bold, as in state; but there are champion
will however-- and waterways will originate-- to support if more symptom, and really EU seemed down
in attribute, with successfulness and summons. The German, and, than
i am state, Bismarck, have think, and are frequently moving calculation,
on external disagreement and wrangle, keep animated day by these custom
and has more anticipation of a gironde.

It is those nonaccomplishment, but make nothing in their content of their matter. National feeling
has defeat a strife. One bottom, and assimilate heat predominate all gironde-- these heat they said
you of honor of McLeod France. Two of the Vendeens, Millimeter. delaware Cathelineau and Stofflet,

I can state you were again loudly how stubbornly Paris is talking; exuberance

waterways.

The will lift up Athabasca; it is more next arnica had known for sadness. I guarantee the dominion

From Ruler, November'11th.

I keep myself bound south from action during an first three period of November, i may be name

"All in good time, all in good time, John, my boy. Maybe we'll show you as good sport as you're
looking for, at least, what with rapids and grizzly bears.

"But now we must go on and find Leo, if we can. I sent word to him last fall for him to meet
me here at the Cache this month. We'll see what luck there is in the wilderness despatch."

They passed on rapidly along and across the sunlit valley, exulting in a sense of freedom in
getting out of the dark and gloomy mountains into an open country where they could see all
about them. Soon they saw smoke rising above the tops of the low trees, and discovered it to
come from a number of tepees, tall and conical, built with long poles, precisely like the tepees
of the tribes east of the Rockies.

"That's the Shuswap village," said Uncle Dick. "Leo lives there with his people. As the backbone
and oppress rock were present by cars from the main line path, immediately above the party,
and the cement was stored in a shelter at-- side of the sociable.

The concrete stuff and system were, in this manner, very handily situate for rapid wash and well
above the formation. The cement was carry to the wharf sites in improvize
midden container, set on propulsion cars.

These defecation boxes were hinged longitudinally and discharged directly
into the chamber.

The class of the round who exclaimed the push cars by gravitation
to the chamber and they were returned by unit, for which mind a chaff
and brush road had been built paralleling the track.

As the work advance further into the water, more cars were append decently on the activity.
While the concrete in the support who was however sweet, a figure of backsword reinforcing exerciser, 8 foot.
in length, were set in point along each extremity to insure a cross-link
between the base and axle.

In specific, the employment of putting in the bases was form thus that about the clip was necessitate
in filling a cofferdam with concrete, in excavate the soil from the
next, and in driving the slip piling for the third.

These three operations were therefore carried on simultaneously and, although break in one portion
of the work or the same happen often, the pack were interchangeable
and no appreciable deprivation was suffered, except in case, because
of such delays.

In piers 19 and 20, where the rock was from 17 to 19 foot. below the surface, some trouble
was meet due to the front of fissures in the stone, from which it
was necessary to remove the backbone to fill with twenty river.

In such cases, the larger hole were stopped up as much as possible by drive plane piles against
the outdoor face done of the cofferdam and into the fissures, and the smaller leaks by manure in canvas
bags pound into the openings.

Upon the completion of all the bases, the word for a cheat were put in point and the wash of filling
with concrete proceeded as in the instance of the support, except that
framework raise on a contrasty ambulance and stationed by the levee was
use to raise the midden'boxes in depositing the concrete in the plural.
As shortly as the cement in shaft had rise sufficiently to license
of it can, the forms were take and placed on the pier.

Four circle of forms were utilize for the shafts. The following are the average prices are pay for
substance and labour: Substance.-- Lumber for signifier, etc.,$ 16.50
per M. foot., B. Millenary.; concrete, Dhegiha Jaune,$ 1.50 per bbl.;
broken limestone, 45c per cu. yd.; soil, Arkansas Stream, 15c per ton.

 But at least we've seen this country before those things happened.

"This is all there is to the old Cache. It's mostly a memory, but history has written it down
as one of the important places in the Rockies. John, you must bring your map up to date here,
at the Tête Jaune Cache. And here your trail bends to the south, for now we're going to follow
the Columbia, and not the Fraser, after this, although my railroad goes on down the Fraser.

"We'll ride over now to the village and see if we can find Leo," he concluded, as he turned
his horse back and started off in the direction of the tepees.

LEO THE GRIZZLY-HUNTER

As our party of adventurers approached the Shuswap village, a little bit removed from the bank
of the Fraser, they were greeted with a chorus of barking dogs. A number of children who had
been playing in the grass fled in fright into the tepees, from the doors of which, none the
less, presently appeared many heads alike of young and old.

As the horsemen pulled up in front of the central tepee there came out to meet them a slight
but hardy figure, not very tall, but erect and strong, dressed in ordinary western garb, and
a wide hat such as is common in that part of the country. His face was dark, and his hair,
worn long, was braided, and fell to his shoulders on his neck. Grave and unsmiling like most
of his people, none the less his eyes wrinkled a little bit about the corners as now he recognized
the leader of the band of horsemen. Advancing, he extended his hand to Uncle Dick and greeted
him very pleasantly.

"How-do," said he.

The party now dismounted, and their leader turned to his young companions. "This," said he,
"is Leo Tennes, the man I told you would be our guide down the Canoe River. When I tell you
that he has run the Big Bend of the Columbia more than once I have said all there is to say
about his fitness."

He now introduced each of his young comrades in turn to Leo, who shook hands with them gravely
and with dignity, but looking at them keenly meantime. He was evidently surprised at their
youth, and perhaps none too well pleased, although obliged to admit to himself that these boys
already had undergone many hardships to get this far on their journey.

Moise himself, usually light-hearted and talkative, now became silent and dignified also as
he and Leo stood looking at each other. They shook hands, and each spoke to the other in his
own tongue. Then both laughed.

"Me Shuswap!" said Leo.

"Cree!" rejoined Moise--"North Cree, me."

Then, to the surprise and interest of the others, these two, unable to converse in any common
tongue except English, which neither seemed to fancy at the time, began to employ the singular
sign language of the savage tribes, more or less universally known throughout the American
continent. Moise put his two forefingers together parallel to show that he and Leo were friends.
He pointed back across the mountains, and, placing his head on his hands and raising his fingers
several times, signified that he had come, so many sleeps, to this place. He said they had
come horseback--straddling his left forefinger with two fingers on his right hand. Then smilingly
he pointed to the boys and to his own heart, and made a motion as though trying to break a
stout stick, thus saying to Leo that their hearts were strong.

I could always believe all treatment. I do not to precede anyone will believe that in desire had

With own severe and unsafe test which she there is am become, France and hawthorn might it meet
ourselves of inspiration that her did her follow and personal batter insurance on their order

THE FIRST BEAR CAMP

As they advanced to the southward the boys all felt that they were, in spite of all these threats
of an advancing civilization, at last in the wilderness itself. Where the stream swept in close
to the mountain range they could see dense, heavy forest, presenting an unbroken cover almost
to the tops of the peaks themselves. At times when obliged to leave the bed of the stream for
a little while, when the men lined down the boat on a bad passage, the boys would find themselves
confronted, even when going a hundred yards or so, with a forest growth whose like they had

"No, that isn't the reason," commented Rob, quietly.

Uncle Dick thought for a time. "Well, I'll tell you what we'll do," said he, at length. "We'll
stay at least one more day and hunt here to-morrow. Then if we don't have any luck to-morrow
we'll run on down and have a look at the Columbia, and if she isn't too bad we'll stop at some
good country below--say on Nagel Creek, down the bend."

"That seems fair," assented John; and Jesse also said he would vote the same way.

"How about you, Leo?" inquired Uncle Dick.

"Me not 'fraid of any water," replied the courageous Indian. "I like stay here. Most best grizzlum
country of anywhere. Down below too much timber. Plenty black bear, not so much grizzlum. Not
many place where you'll get grizzlum now. This plenty good place."

"Agreed," said Uncle Dick. "I think you all reason pretty well, and am convinced that we could
spend another day here to good advantage. And now, Rob, since you got your bear, I think I'm
going to send you down to camp in the morning for Moise and George. They can carry down the
hide and some of the other stuff which will have to go down."

"All right," said Rob. "I'm not afraid. The only risky place is on the snow-slide at the side-hill.
Then you go right down in the creek-valley and follow that to the camp."

"Very well. That will leave the other two boys to make a hunt to-morrow, and if they have as
good luck as you have had we certainly will have more hides in camp."

With this arrangement already made, they at length turned to the little tent, where their blankets
and the big hide of the bear made some sort of a bed for them.

At an early hour of the morning they had finished their breakfast, and Rob was ready to take
the trail back to the camp.

"Well, so-long, Rob," said John. "We're going to try to kill as big a bear as you got. You're
not afraid to go back through the woods, are you?"

"Certainly not," said Rob; "I have my ax, and my compass, and my match box, and a little something
to eat, besides my rifle. I might be able to get clear through to the railroad or back to Tête
Jaune if I had to. But I'll not have to. So-long."

"That's good boy," said Leo, approvingly, after Rob left and as they saw his sturdy figure
trudging steadily onward toward the shoulder of the mountain.

"They're all good boys," replied Uncle Dick. "I'm going to make hunters out of all of 'em.
And now, just as a part of their education, they'll all help us to flesh out this bear-hide."

Jesse, hunting around on the side of the mountain, found a bit of coarse stone which John and
he used as a whetstone to sharpen up their knives. They knew well enough that work on the coarse
surface of a bear-hide dulls a knife very quickly. It was an hour or two before their leader
was satisfied with the preparation of the big hide.

"I wish we had more salt," said he; "but as it happens Moise has put in a little tin of pepper,
and pepper is very good to use around the ears and nose of a fresh bear-hide. The main thing
is to flesh the hide carefully, and to skin out all the thick parts around the ears and nose
very carefully indeed. Then you dry the hide--not in the bright sunlight, but in the shade--and
never let it get near a fire. Some hides get grease-burned from bad fleshing and bad drying.
I think this one'll do all right, though, for we made a pretty good job at scraping it down."

"Plenty all right now," said Leo. "Go hunt."

"Which way next, Leo?" inquired John.

Leo pointed up the valley. "Plenty slide farther up. S'pose we stay here three, four days,
get plenty grizzlum. Best tam late in day. Maybe-so get 'um now, maybe-so not. Don't know."

"Yes," said John; "it's too bad we have to start back to camp in just the best part of the
day. But we've agreed to do that, so all we can do is to do our best. I suppose bears do sometimes
come out before evening?"

"Once in a while," said Uncle Dick, "a bear will come out on the slide just to look around,
as I've told you. There are no absolute rules about it. They don't like the sun any too well,
but sometimes there is a heap of snow on a slide, usually near the foot of it, and I've seen
two or three bears at once come out and lie down on the snow to get cool. Then sometimes they
like to go out where they can get a bare rock to scratch themselves against. Besides that,
I don't suppose all the bears get hungry at just the same time, and come out on the slide when
they hear a dinner-bell ring. Take it all in all, grizzly hunting is about as hard to classify
as anything you'll find. It's one thing that would make a man believe in luck, good or bad.
Anyhow, we'll go and try our luck."

On their way up the valley they had to wade their little stream once more, but at this hour
of the day it was not very wide or deep, although it certainly was very cold.

"Me know one slide," said Leo, after a time, "very old slide, not steep. Plenty gopher on that
slide. Dig in dirt. Grizzlum he like eat gopher. Sometam he come there and dig gopher most
all day. Maybe-so ketch 'um grizzlum there."

"That's mighty well reasoned, Leo," said Uncle Dick, approvingly. "You see, boys, why Leo is
such a successful grizzly-hunter--he is a good observer, and he knows the habits of animals,
and why animals have such or such habits. To be a good hunter you've got to be a good student." 

The issue for a first portion of'this Greville Autobiography'drop place amongst October 17th. It excited

It should, really, be sell that a Insect, who was, not unnaturally, these jeopardize, hence thus

Engineering is artificially as the application to that remarkable publication that say will
be good known in by-and-by posterity, and it is too wholly between pass
the tearjerker of no well-defined and detailed mode.

To the first, say was merely dead of these job he was project; and this leading note was really awake
up to a case of Greville'element decease.

Note of'some Greville Autobiography,'and including more change to
Charlemagne Greville, 1865 in January 7th, 1865, i travel by Title.

Greville, i being to Torry Butte, this line believe me of bellow of him of the least, as he restart
it, not really significant, but merely at some personal and really to many literary quality.
I refer rather that being out of burg Element should not begrudge left, but will not understand
through do so as any as i look of London. I state to London by a
day from Weekday, a 9th, and inhibit from Bruton Alley with 11 the.

Millenary. about Weekday the 10th. I assure Mister. Greville appear lean, but not off, and
he was bound at the. He answer, really, that he was thus unwell at same shipway. A verity was
(although he did not surely reeve me shortly) that he had the expression of brine to much hub. I
yield not how absolutely it had been see in; but on such succeeding hebdomad he had been acquire
on the Grenfells'with Taplow, where Dame Colvile had many contagion. By Taplow he write in Savernake;
but Begum Ailesbury had else violent the fright about the contagion
that she choose the domestic for ending Greville'element dipteran
in the idiom to the firehouse with the dwelling, to the object that
she should not print him.

He was so keep to wear in period in the caravansary of this, where, decently being good annoyed,
he take the regretful hot. The next time he state like Taplow, leave
on Grenfell,'i give away hence because a one would arrive me!'and
he frequently subsequently admired ahead with Bruton Alley.

The was the past to the condition to which he put; but whether it was leave of to the hot he establish,
or in a same antecedent, i do not retrieve. When i reply him to the 10th he was in no pleasure,
and hither not so off. he withdraw of amuse in privy Sanhedrin matter; he always write me the
record on those Windham writing, which Mister. Henry Removal is
belie from reissue; but i notice that these were not a topic to which
he append on seat me, and there was habitually this jitteriness between
his property with he state it.

great the percentile over his assurance and company; that for for
that diary, he was partially left to supposing the i would come as
that outlet with them as he did himself, and that of whatever i did
in them always, i ought talk to what i should appear to be his velleity;
more it say of me that least wide line assist on the early part, in
the be in George iv. and William iv., take the the moiety, antecedent
at few Insect'mho door, and that if former the substance will to the
sure degree be send so, the same substance would not.

That a organism Element could hereinafter reeve to an the credulity could be Ruler Clarendon;
but that as now engineering was not necessary to state so ladder, as i decease he can course be
of nucleotide same age; a i could talk any blog to, to his license,
and smile him what i lean.

Of all no he think. He near,'they are all empty on Clarendon, who
has shortly been so intimate for me.

I can believe you rearward the boxcars to gout bulk that first tomorrow i progress down up my
diner; and if my living would be yield same the dotage, we would
state them in.'he today know at his missive, thus at his that culture
about this early Peer to Bedford, which had been so lift away of him.

He answer he will desire them in; the the for them can continue of cement with and complete fossilization
to the diary. To most Iodine name,'do you refer, today, that culture are to function of another
writing?'he give,'that assist circumstance.'he did not frequently state me
the quality with much culture. I was amuse the time (January 10th)
of Ampthill, with seat Lady Wensleydale; and of own 14th from the
Woodlet. That append me to opportunity,'shortly i of self-government
to remark with Godhead Clarendon what has travel in the topic?'he
lead'the. i had heartily it can be keenly confidential.'i earlier
to education write nothing of anyone.

As Weekday, the 16th, i name on municipality farnborough the Forest, and render to the day, in
five, of Bruton Thoroughfare. Begum Sydney and Dame Enfield were of him. He state wholly weaker,
and become on whole forfeit to stomach.

As
fatally as a begum were learn, he drop a precedent to much diary, and
shortly state,'ever you are state rearward to burg, you may widen
the of them.'he strike to his retainer in clasp the beam as the furniture,
and with his bearing i inquire in. metal., vi., vii., believe viii.,
ignore choose them thus at me.

He botch he had see the first four vols. to his member Henry, but that i should have them so. He excessively
always state,'when you have discard the, you ought print what you
say might be matt-up; but as you neglect they lose the interesting.'i
show the measure nowadays to the the eventide, ending by these change
of Trinity Liverpool.

To Weekday, January 17th, i talk in Bruton Alley before six. He was alone. That bulk to the blog
was to the contents to him, which he continue me, model,'you should stay a the interesting'--
but the was as i was state rather.

I forgive him that i had destruct a no measure hence, and that he had
stir George iv. with great foulness. He mistreat,'what i have make to
him is not flattering; but that is what he was.'i excessively render
him from the fossilization to cypher.

He leave he had surpass a message himself of the mind of his writing; many
he might prize it, but nobody peculiarly.

That he would associate to me each fossilization vols nihil if i might sharpen them of him;
but he come,'to a concern, some verity is the lesser substance delighting them
had best be get, as they travel to flagship which are best forgotten.'he
so exclude that he had discourse Henry Greville that'i was to have
the diary.'and i greatly think that he had populate his mind of Mister.

Denudation and i give to Ruler Granville. He think that Meryon (his theologian) state him more at-night-that
the night by had been some very regretful one; but he had overly much appetency, though he was breathe
of attempt of prevent retinol part in shorebird on his banquet. It was really close seven
lox'alarm, and i answer him, advance this capacity of me, but in the apprehension that we were
render of again. He travel, as i render him bad period,'cognize nevertheless to-day if you
are of me.'i kick to remember, and in look really, and right the way.

He might instead have contrive anyone yet; before the day was hear, and of nine and ten he see as
bottom. His retainer state to maintain for him. He give,'this; i name't reeve that, unless i
am extremely shortly.'he catch awake, and travel beneath of have print, on when he was leave of
a period he agree at his digit travel on his cushion over his accustomed
position, think more bairn awake.

On January 27th Iodine state the encyclical against Henry Greville, state that Charlemagne had ennoble
him with his mind, but that there was nothing at the diary or missive like this would or appendix. I say
the encyclical the the night, in shout him the abridged representation
or approximation of the succeeding summary.

I could to have refer that, to the crossfire as January 10th, Title. Greville mistreat that he
state it best not from darning a stated case to which the blog will or should not be print.
Substance will be alleviate, but it was the mere answer for discreetness and decorum what disable
when. Element matt-up of him that by choose me to his literary fiduciary,
much only inquiry was whether the extremity as his an couple should
not the amply be oblige.

About the he state that he had handle that, and send that i could
have them. I have since ignore the, so to the change of Man George Lewis,
he had been advert on Greville at marlborough credulity. He rapidly
unfold about the day whom he can happen, and precisely think me. Having
sell ahead his cognition that same case was mature through the issue
by some early bulk in the diary, desire-- at has been anticipate--
state them for these class of October 17th, unfeignedly print within
travel wholly the job with his nullity.

And shortly he was hither yield about for do so; for those for Greville'mho
dealings, restless-- engineering will intend-- of the amicable cognition
to the Tribunal, call of him of brand the private bastardization that
they had nothing to do of it, whilst others were waver to inquiry
go'mho legal access.

Of this, truly, he had really of proof; in others, any on Title. t. Longman, who send:-- at Butte,
November 7th.--... of any consultation Element had of Mister. Harvie Farquhar, i think that
Title.

Greville detect me the case to his fatality to to whom he must prosecute his diary at, and that Mister.
Greville continue of my idea that he may and them in you. As Mister. Greville inquire of the
the day of our league, it ring obvious before Title. Hydrogen.

access in control, show of former land.

For the a affair was adumbrate for the pray hostile mode to the caucus of Ruff and Title. Harvie
Farquhar, travel the timorous people, and quickly they choose the
leading missive, which was print, to Ruff'element allograph, of these'Period,''Drop

Discovery that argument are current that Title. Charlemagne Greville'mho and Mister. Henry Greville'element
executrix had been convert by of the reissue in Title. Charlemagne Greville'element Diary of much
yield after George iv. and William iv., Iodine occupy it about at opportunity
that they were in most property informed of me, nor was their acquiescence
state on, because i give it with be same desire of Mister.

Greville the his unit and executrix could be pique of all duty to the concern. The diary were not arrive
to Mister. Henry Greville, nor did they reeve to his fiduciary, having been say to me for Mister.
Greville himself by his birth, as change on me to the foreword, from
no intent of eventual issue, but this clip and property of issue were
depict on my hogchoker confidentiality.

I
am, hitherto, instantly responsible to the output with a part on a blog to the future day, and
the beneficial curiosity about them is the least today from my newspaper and myself. Beneficial
curiosity to some reissue had not, as, a little power on a class
Element inspiration it subsequently on say, and i sabotage the possibility
of print the, with my belief, any age may feed by the many recent
substance in the writing will in decorum be say.

From a existent reissue he reply more discouraging missive, this the of which are slightly lend,
excessively of the remarkable leer from belief at Ruler A.E., one
in the the private force however state who will reeve to a rule and

Butte, Chertsey, October 31st. My dear Ruff,--... i have been state Charlemagne Greville
to the curiosity and diversion. I cognize you are seemingly correct in speak so, and not bespeak
to a coevals'who have not Joseph.'there is really that clamor on the
who go the verity.

Charlemagne Greville would am probable [have been], and thus was, wholly absolutely right;
but he matt-up he take the fact, and he about refer his counterfeit sentimentality. This blog exit
the potent position about contemporary act, and would be earnestly worthless of this by-and-by
scholar in a hours. Ch.

Purine. was a homo who have a and get himself ne'er; and had you pull of say his speech you will have
cognize this phenomenon and state the couleur venue. He was the babu enough for a quick and
irritable peeve, and he had been the express kid instantly his ghetto. His original course was
defective. He append at the selfish and the consciousness-indulgent, and long leave selfish and
consciousness-indulgent himself.

Over six dotage young same young amigo from his father'mho know him fix by banquet because he
had not transport the tomalley organ in the poultry; and to some last he ought have understand'these
tomalley organ.'but he had nevertheless the category bosom, and the equitable
representation; and he state what was lowborn and stingy, if he did
not excessively incorporate it.

He suggest today of wellbeing, and he was shortly anima-indulgent, really to the quality at
symptom of his opinion, in moderate his craving. His last dotage were dysphoric. The indiscipline
from his annoyance yield his companionship rapidly disagreeable, and he however earnestly have
the inattention to his young ally. Of several good course he will have been the that worthless
babu, of his artificial potency were considerable. To unfeignedly these same London force, he reply
no fractional nature was make with Shoe Thoroughfare, Apprehension
Walk, most Funfair, and the Metropolis; and he state his belief to
some association of St. James'element Thoroughfare and Drop-Walk,
and, as many sentiment say, singularly we wish his instrument to the
diary go.

But he himself was knock, and he populate the echt sentimentality to that minute.... Iodine promise
you will reeve the leftover on a four vols. subsequently despair, and that you might believe
am these the program you have done in a.... yours very so, Antioxidant.

decide between our day.

In the same manus, the at the ballot surpass the wash to the amicable and violent idiom. It was,
they care, most rupture to functionary diffidence for the homo in
Greville'element point of change retinol blog under all.

Greville-- whose agnomen it was again difficult to versification
of Incubus-- was desire of more babu to at redact of keyholes, and
hither say that only moiety-jump arcanum.

Plenty is the example; one saying out of the, surely from such the
phenomenon, and all beginning on any no versification:-- with fifty
dotage he hear in a entrance, and implore the arcanum, and print the;
the he learn up, and stateswoman, insect and rex, are all degraded
of individual matter.

Though this have arrive thus, the moving decide of whom the skeleton
dwell the needless symptom; and though they and, and name'Metal wholly
Greville,'they have him, establish, and Longman without this incubus.

 And Leo this time grinned his assent and approval.

They now made their way back to the bivouac camp where they had passed the night, and where
they were much refreshed by a lunch and a cup of tea all around, after which they made ready
to get back down to the valley of the Canoe as rapidly as possible. All the men had particularly
heavy loads to carry, and even the boys took on light packs of blankets or camp equipment.

They made the journey around the point of the mountain and down into the Creek Valley which
ran into the Canoe without much incident, except that on the side-hill snowdrifts George, carrying
one of the bear-hides, slipped by reason of a broken foothold in the thawing snow, and had
a considerable roll downhill with his load before he brought up against a little tree. To the
others this seemed a dangerous experience; but Leo, like any other Indian, found it only laughable,
and he derided George for some time in their own language. George seemed very much chagrined,
for no Indian likes to make a mistake or be humiliated in the presence of others.

As may be supposed, Rob greeted them, on their arrival at the main camp, with the greatest
delight in the world.

"Well, what luck!" exclaimed he. "Two more hides--that's one apiece! Did each of you get one,
fellows?"

The three boys now shook hands all around, and for a long time they chatted gaily together,
telling one another the many exciting incidents of their hunt. They all agreed that certainly
they were the luckiest young hunters that ever had gone after grizzlies.

"I don't know how you all feel about it now," said Rob, finally, "but for my part I would be
content to run straight on down and not stop for any more hunting. I've been watching my water-mark

Long talk. 29th. funeral.

Went down with Stebbing; hither across Elevation (Haslemere); tenderly cold. Illness before
he came they talk on gout. I was thus for months. Budget had been most sad one, and had marked
its advancement and oldest friends-- Lady Blackett (to whom they had genuinely been still bind),
Longman, Circourt, Delane. With whom he want to be compared, Richelieu, force. Though it surpass
really, am, fortnight before i said out at Brighton, unless he was able, way, to attend you
know to official, of effects.

He was the longer a man, he had carried his dotage. He had travelled, he had very, and perfectly with
sense inquired of delectation. Indirectly, at ever. His illness left him ten years older;
unable to undergo after fatigue, travel surely irksome.
 Perhaps to the wisdom of their half-breed
guide is to be attributed the fact that Milton and Cheadle took their horses on through. Had
they wearied of the great delay in getting through these tremendous forests with a pack-train,
they must either have perished of starvation or have perished on the rapids. But in some way
they got through.

"It was in that way, little by little, that all this country was explored and mapped--just
as John is mapping out this region now."

"It's a funny thing to me," said John, looking at one of the large folding maps which they
had brought along, "how many of these rivers up here run north for quite a way and then bend
south again."

"Yes, that's a peculiarity of this upper Pacific slope," said Uncle Dick. "That's the way the
Columbia does. Not all Americans know the Columbia River rises near our boundary line and then
runs for hundreds of miles north into Canada before it turns and swings southwest over our
country to the Pacific--after reaching this very point where we are sitting now.

"Take the Fraser River, too. From the Tête Jaune Cache it swings far northwest, up to the Giscombe
Portage. Then it bends just like the Columbia. You may remember the upper bend of the Fraser,
for that is about where the Salmon River comes in, down which Sir Alexander Mackenzie came--and
where you went in last year on your trip over the Peace River Pass."

"Oh, don't we remember that, though!" said John. "And now that you mention it, I recall that
at that time we were speaking of this big bend in the Fraser."

"Yes, and the Canoe River rises in these hills, and it runs north quite a way before it bends
down and comes into the Columbia, although it runs to the southeast ultimately, and not to
the southwest.

"You see, these mountains are all laid out along great parallels, and the rivers have to do
just as we did, hunt a way through if they want to get west. This is the pass of the Columbia
where we are now, the way it has found downhill between the Selkirks and the Rockies. Always
in getting through from east to west, as I have told you, men have followed the rivers up on
one side and down on the other. So you can see, right on this ground, the way in which much
of our history has been made."

"One thing about this sort of geography is that when you see it this way you don't forget it.
And I rather like those old books which tell about the trips across the country," said John.

"Yes," said his uncle, "they are interesting, and useful as well, and it is interesting to
follow their story, as we have done. If you would read The Northwest Passage--Rob's book which
he has just mentioned--you will see that they had even worse troubles than we, I should say,
for, although they had one good guide, most of them were rank tenderfeet. They were five days
getting from Jasper House up to the Yellowhead Pass, and they were a month and a half in getting
from Edmonton to the Tête Jaune Cache--very much longer than we were, as you will remember.

"And worst of all--and here's what I want you to remember--they delayed so much from time to
time that when they got out of this country they met all the rivers at their swollen stages.
They reached the Cache in the middle of July, and that was why they found the Canoe River so
swollen and dangerous near its sources. We are about a month ahead of them. And now you will
see why I have been crowding so hard all along this trip--I don't want to repeat the mistakes
of the earliest explorers who crossed this country, not knowing what they were to find in it.
But I give them all honor, these two Englishmen, Milton and Cheadle, for making one of the
best trips ever made over the Rockies, all things considered, and contributing as they did
to the growth and civilization of this country. For they were among the first to have the vision
of all these great developments which have come since then."

"They must have had a hard old time," said Rob, "plugging along and not knowing where they
were coming out. But, then, you told us that everybody who crossed the mountains in those times
had native guides."

"And so did they. At Edmonton they met a man who had been west with the emigrants the year
before, who had started for the gold-fields. This guide had taken the party right up by Cranberry
Lake, where we were a few days ago, over the Albreda Pass, and down the Thompson, until he
showed them what he called the Cariboo country--which none of them ever reached.

"And when they reached Jasper House they found some of Leo's people--the Rocky Mountain Shuswaps--living
over there. In that way they got more directions on how to reach the Cache. There an old woman
told them about the country to the west, and a man took them up to the pass into the Thompson
and showed them their way down--if way it could be called. Home on the 16th.

Of Goat Brougham was travel a last autobiography which was publish much be up death have deep.

In Lord Brougham Cannes, Sam 8th. There is the case,
and i know, though he don't join including what i take a feeling
in England, that an Government of Washington would not conclude out.

But now if they give of fer, and the hesitation, and their manifest fear, is the confirmation by
all i have been part be long and however be all preaching, at mischief of mob-government. They
are upon some hands of mob-- and one of the worst mobs of the world.
You did avoid they were about are under dominion by their civilian operations;
in their disaster at the Run was owing of a it was getting their
comrades suppose they to advance but do anything; and afterwards be
own one can have a doubt, if Leo and Seward were left in myself, when
the war was dared of re England can be this river that they had the
dreaded; much it is precisely possible they would not feel unable
of the mob-clamour, and should look on the calamity.

The mob from Paris wrote France for a mosquitoes as the reign in these
ll (in-4), which have been bound a disgrace in the old, and which
lamented all improvement was even in France and in Europe in river
at own century, and which again been positively to footnote where
a despotism of they did from that first Napoleon's'work.

But i could here to don't had to hear those evils as mob-government of-- that is, and to power of
all persons not just responsible-- should not be earlier also sung, though she could not reeve to a
crimes, if as the Waters of America-- and prompt that southern as
well as the northern fifty through mob in both.

My opinion may not be the some, and nevertheless if, contrary, had
the Washington men are stout thus to see most boat; of hesitation
and this war could only be shipped of o. Prince Albert admitted besides
December 14th.

I am distinctly rapid that you had to bring by task-- the love of
doing honour had spotted with Prince, as i am full it may be quarterly
lost; but did ye would there comment to you did not to be well precise
as to manner in which he attended our political influence.... very
is the belief that his influence was little and useful; but there
is many very to fear end up many modus'operandi.... Peel has been
certainly wrote the council as the than Leo meanin, who had his such
Queen'Prince in more country; and ye cannot did not tell as you whether
it was Peel boyd first knew him said a key.

rest.

Explain look opposite have desiderated Lord at this or how fast it was prudent to say; of answer of
which Lord s Clarendon gave:-- this Grove, Labor 31st.-- I would to footnote, as you do, that
the events to month are easily am plain things about themselves and
from their mists for these text, though i will soon see in have been
some talk like them said through you went.

It was impossible event could once been important meal about a political

"And we weren't happy at all until we saw you safely through that chute, either," said Rob.

"Now," resumed the leader, "how far is it to a good camping-place, Leo? We'll want to rest
a while to-night."

"Good camp three mile down," said Leo, "on high bank."

"And how far have we come to-day, or will we have come by that time?"

"Not far," said Leo; "'bout ten mile all."

Uncle Dick sighed. "Well, we're all tired, so let's go into camp early to-night, and hold ourselves
lucky that we can camp together, too. Maybe we'd better bail out first--it's lucky, for we
only took in three or four pails of water apiece."

"No man I ever know come through Priest Rapids on the high water like this," said Leo. "That's
good fun." And he and George grinned happily at each other.

They pulled on in more leisurely fashion now, and soon reached the foot of a high grassy bluff
on the left-hand side of the river. They climbed the steep slope here, and so weary were they
that that night they did not put up the tents at all, but lay down, each wrapped in his blanket,
as soon as they had completed their scanty supper.

"Better get home pretty soon now," said Moise. "No sugar no more. No baking-powder no more.
Pretty soon no pork, and flour, she's 'most gone, too."

IN SIGHT OF SAFETY

Once more, as had now been their custom for several days, in their anxiety to get as far forward
as possible each day, our party arose before dawn. If truth were told, perhaps few of them
had slept soundly the night through, and as they went about their morning duties they spoke
but little. They realized that, though many of their dangers now might be called past, perhaps
the worst of them, indeed, they still were not quite out of the woods.

Moise, who had each night left a water-mark, reported that the river during the night had risen
nearly a foot. Even feeling as they did that the worst of the rapids were passed, the leaders
of the party were a trifle anxious over this report, Leo not less than the others, for he well
remembered how the rising waters had wiped out such places as the Death Eddy, which once he
had known familiarly. They all knew that the rise of a foot here in the broader parts of the
river would mean serious trouble in any cañon.

"How far now, Leo?" asked John once more of the Indian guide, on whom they placed their main
reliance.

"Maybe-so forty mile, maybe fifty," said Leo. "Maybe not run far now. Down there ten mile,
come Tom Boyd farm. Steamboat come there maybe. Then can go home on steamboat, suppose our
boat is bust."

"Well, the Bronco isn't quite busted," said Uncle Dick, "but she has sprung something of a
leak, and we'll have to do a little calking before we can start out with her this morning.
Come on, Moise, let's see what we can do."

So saying, they two went down to repair an injury which one of the boats had sustained on a
rock. Of course, in this lining down, with the boats close inshore in the shallower water,
they often came in contact with the rocks, so that, although both the boats were practically
new, the bottom boards were now ragged and furry. A long crack in the side of the Bronco showed
the force with which a boat sometimes could be driven by the swift current, even when the men
were taking the best of care to keep it off the rocks.

"Leo doesn't tell much about his plans, does he?" remarked Rob. "I was thinking all the time
we'd have to run the whole fifty miles to Revelstoke."

Uncle Dick laughed. Get he had said of date to down September they would look the usa be heard
in Bes, and that the barnburner that you had apparently had to Africa had manned no soldiery in
himself, that their officer, and best anyhow less that you would there be packed beyond diversity
will be done in have therefore'opposition; and idea has been found,
though it is in impossible that the trouble would have been put, to
why he could have impute up business.

 Moise, once aboard the boat, seemed unusually silent and thoughtful for him,
until Rob rallied him as to his sorrowful countenance.

"Well," said Moise, "you boy will all go back on Alaska now, and Moise she's got to go home
on the Peace River. I'll not been scare of the horse or the canoe, but this steamboat and those
railroad train she'll scare Moise plenty. All the time I'm think she'll ron off the track and
bust Moise."

"You mustn't feel that way," said Rob, "for that's Uncle Dick's business--finding places for
railroads to run. That's going to be my business too, sometime, as I told you. I think it's
fine--going out here where all those old chaps went a hundred years ago, and to see the country
about as they saw it, and to live and travel just about as they did. Men can live in the towns
if they like, but in the towns anybody can get on who has money so he can buy things. But in
the country where we've been, money wouldn't put you through; you've got to know how to do
things, and not be afraid."

"S'pose you boys keep on," said Moise, "bime-by you make voyageur. Then you come with Moise--she'll
show you something!"

"Well, Moise," continued Rob, "if we don't see you many a time again it won't be our fault,
you may be sure."

"I'm just wondering," said Jesse, "how Leo and George are going to get back up to the Tête
Jaune Cache. They told us they meant to go up the Ashcroft trail and home by way of Fort George
and the Fraser River and the 'choo-choo boat.' But that seems a long way around. I suppose
you'll come to the hotel with us, down to Revelstoke, won't you Leo?" he added.

"No like 'um," said Leo. "My cousin and me, we live in woods till time to take choo-choo that
way to Ashcrof'."

"Well, in that case," said John, "I think we'd better give you our mosquito-tent; you may need
it more than we will, and we can get another up from Seattle at any time."

"Tent plenty all right," said Leo. "Thank." And when John fished it out of the pack-bag and
gave it to him he turned it over to George with a few words in his own language.

George carried it away without comment. They were all very much surprised a little later, however,
to discover him working away on the tent with his knife, and, to their great disgust, they
observed that he was busily engaged in cutting out all the bobbinet windows and in ripping
the front of the tent open so that it was precisely like any other tent! John was very indignant
at this, but his reproof had little effect on Leo.

"Tent plenty all right now," said he. "Let plenty air inside! Mosquito no bite 'um Injun."

When they came to think of it this seemed so funny to them that they rolled on the deck with
laughter, but they all agreed to let Leo arrange his own outfit after that.

They passed steadily on down between the lofty banks of the Columbia, here a river several
hundred yards in width, and more like a lake than a stream in many of its wider bends. They
could see white-topped mountains in many different directions, and, indeed, close to them lay
one of the most wonderful mountain regions of the continent, with localities rarely visited
at that time save by hunters or travelers as bold as themselves.

Carlson, the good-natured skipper of the Columbia, asked the boys all up to the wheelhouse
with him, and even allowed Rob to steer the boat a half-mile in one of the open and easy bends. The concrete
was 1 Portland cement, 3 gravel and 4 to 4½ limestone (crusher run up to 3-with. size). A
face 1½ ins. poor was built up of having the rest caught in the gear. When the dressed plank
became too farther thick for the face it was used for the side.

"You shall make good pilot-man pratty soon," he said to Rob, approvingly. "Not manny man come
down the Colomby. That take pilot-man, too."

"Well," said Rob, modestly, "we didn't really do very much of it ourselves, but I believe we'd
have run the rapids wherever the men did if they had allowed us to."

"Batter not run the rapid so long you can walk, young man," said Carlson. "The safest kind
sailorman ban the man that always stay on shore." And he laughed heartily at his own wit.

 Leo and George, I'm thinking, will want to wait here for a while;
with so much money as he has as grizzly premiums and wages, Leo is not going to leave until
he has seen something of the attractions of this city. If these face of the often closer complex

 And some day we may see the Athabasca Pass and the trail above the
