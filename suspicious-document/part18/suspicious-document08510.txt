OLE MAMMY'S TORMENT.

CHAPTER I.

Uncle Billy rested his axe on the log he was chopping, and turned his grizzly old head to one
side, listening intently. A confusion of sounds came from the little cabin across the road.
It was a dilapidated negro cabin, with its roof awry and the weather-boarding off in great
patches; still, it was a place of interest to Uncle Billy. His sister lived there with three
orphan grandchildren.

Leaning heavily on his axe-handle, he thrust out his under lip, and rolled his eyes in the
direction of the uproar. A broad grin spread over his wrinkled black face as he heard the rapid
spank of a shingle, the scolding tones of an angry voice, and a prolonged howl.

"John Jay an' he gran'mammy 'peah to be havin' a right sma't difference of opinion togethah
this mawnin'," he chuckled.

He shaded his eyes with his stiff, crooked fingers for a better view. A pair of nimble black
legs skipped back and forth across the open doorway, in a vain attempt to dodge the descending
shingle, while a clatter of falling tinware followed old Mammy's portly figure, as she made
awkward but surprising turns in her wrathful circuit of the crowded room.

"Ow! I'll be good! I'll be good! Oh, Mammy, don't! You'se a-killin' me!" came in a high shriek.

Then there was a sudden dash for the cabin door, and an eight-year-old colored boy scurried
down the path like a little wild rabbit, as fast as his bare feet could carry him. The noise
ended as suddenly as it had begun; so suddenly, indeed, that the silence seemed intense, although
the air was full of all the low twitterings and soft spring sounds that come with the early
days of April.

Uncle Billy stood chuckling over the boy's escape. The situation had been made clear to him
by the angry exclamations he had just overheard. John Jay, left in charge of the weekly washing,
flapping on the line, had been unfaithful to his trust. A neighbor's goat had taken advantage
of his absence to chew up a pillowcase and two aprons.

Really, the child was not so much to blame. It was the fault of the fish-pond, sparkling below
the hill. But old Mammy couldn't understand that. She had never been a boy, with the water
tempting her to come and angle for its shining minnows; with the budding willows beckoning
her, and the warm winds luring her on. But Uncle Billy understood, and felt with a sympathetic
tingle in every rheumatic old joint, that it was a temptation beyond the strength of any boy
living to resist.

His chuckling suddenly stopped as the old woman appeared in the doorway. He fell to chopping
again with such vigor that the chips flew wildly in all directions. He knew from the way that
her broad feet slapped along the beaten path that she was still angry, and he thought it safest
to take no notice of her, beyond a cheery "Good mawnin', sis' Sheba."

 It was open only during the summer months. The roses that Mistress Alice
had set out with her own white hands years ago climbed all over the front of the house, twining
around its tall pillars, and hanging down in festoons from its stately eaves. Cuttings from
the same hardy plant had been trained along the fences, around the tree-trunks and over trellises,
until the place had come to be known all around the country as "Rosehaven."

Sheba always had steady employment when the place was open, for the young ladies of the family
kept her flat-irons busy with their endless tucks and ruffles. She found a good market, too,
for all the eggs she could induce her buff cochins to lay, and all the berries that she could
make John Jay pick.

This bright June morning she stood in the door with a basket of fresh eggs in her hand, looking
anxiously across the fields to the gables of Rosehaven, and grumbling to herself.

"Heah I done promise Miss Hallie these fresh aigs for her bufday cake, an' no way to get 'em
to her. I'll nevah get all these clothes done up by night if I stop my i'onin', an' John Jay's
done lit out again! little black rascal!" She lifted up her voice in another wavering call.
"John Ja-a-y!" The beech woods opposite threw back the echo of her voice, sweet and clear,--"Ja-a-y!"

"Heah I come, Mammy!" cried a panting voice. "I was jus' turnin' the grine-stone for Uncle Billy."

She looked at him suspiciously an instant, then handed him the basket. "Take these aigs ovah
to Miss Hallie," she ordered, "and mind you be quickah'n you was last time, or they might hatch
befo' you get there."

"Law now, Mammy!" said John Jay, with a grin. He snatched at the basket, impatient to be off,
for while standing before her he had kept scratching his right shoulder with his left hand;
not that there was any need to do so, but it gave him an excuse for holding together the jagged
edges of a great tear in his new shirt. He was afraid it might be discovered before he could
get away.

It was one of John Jay's peculiarities that in going on an errand he always chose the most
roundabout route. Now, instead of following the narrow footpath that made a short cut through
the cool beech woods, he went half a mile out of his way, along the sunny turnpike.

Mars' Nat stood outside his kitchen window, with his hands in his pockets, giving orders to
the colored boy within, who did his bachelor housekeeping. Usually he had a joking word for
old Sheba's grandson, but this morning he took no notice of the little fellow loitering by
with such an appealing look on his face. John Jay had come past the toll-gate with a hope of
seeing the "Rev'und Gawge," as he called him. It had been three weeks since the man had come
home, and in that time John Jay's interest in him had grown into a sort of hero-worship. There
had been a great deal of talk about him among the ignorant colored people. Wonderful stories
were afloat of his experiences at the North, of his power as a preacher, and of the plans he
had made to help his people. He would have been surprised could he have known how he was discussed,
or how the stories grew as they travelled.

Those who had any claim whatever to a former acquaintance stopped at the cottage to see him.
Their interest and the little offerings of fruit or flowers, which they often made their excuse
for coming, touched him greatly. To all who came he spoke freely of his hopes. Realizing that
he might have but the one opportunity, he talked as only a man can talk who feels the responsibilities
of a lifetime crowded into one short hour. One by one they came and listened, and went away
with a new expression on their faces, and a new ambition in their hearts.

To all these people he was "Brothah Chadwick;" to the three old slaves bound to him by ties
almost as strong as those of kinship, he could never be other than Jintsey's boy; but to two
persons he was known as the "Rev'und Gawge." Mars' Nat took to calling him that in a joking
way, but John Jay gave him the title almost with awe. It seemed to set him apart in the child's
reverent affection as one who had come up out of great tribulation to highest honor. Old Sheba
had not cuffed her grandson to church every week in vain. He had heard a great deal about white
robes and palms of victory and "him that overcometh." By some twist of his simple little brain
the term Reverend had come to mean all that to him, and much more. It meant not only some one
set apart in a priestly way, but some one who was just slipping down into the mysterious valley
of the shadow, with the shining of the New Jerusalem upon his face.

As long as the cottage was in sight John Jay kept rolling his eyes backward as he trudged along
in the dust; but Mars' Nat was the only one in view. Twice he stumbled and almost spilled the
eggs. A little farther along he concluded that he was tired enough to rest a while. So he sat
down on a log in a shady fence corner, and took a green apple from his pocket. He rolled it
around in his hands and over his face, enjoying its tempting odor before he stuck his little
white teeth into it. The first bite was so sour that it drew his face all up into a pucker
and made his eyes water. He raised his hand to throw it away, but paused with his arm in the
air to listen. Somebody was playing on the organ in the church a few rods up the hill.

It was a quaint little stone church, all overgrown with ivy, that the Chadwicks had built generations
ago. The high arched door was never opened of late years, except at long intervals, when some
one came out from the city to hold services. But the side door was certainly ajar now, for
the saddest music that John Jay had ever heard in all his life came trembling out on the warm
summer air.

Forgetting all about his errand, he scrambled through the fence and up the gently rising knoll.
His bare feet made no noise as he tiptoed up the steps and stood peering through the open door.
It was dim and cool inside, with only the light that could sift through the violet and amber
of the stained glass windows; but in one, the big one at the end, was the figure of a snowy
dove, with outstretched wings. Through this silvery pane a long slanting ray of light, dazzling
in its white radiance, streamed across the keys of the organ and the man who played them,--the
Reverend George.

It threw a strange light on the upturned face,--a face black as ebony, worn with suffering,
but showing in every feature the refining touch of a noble spirit. His mournful eyes seemed
looking into another world, while his fingers wandered over the keys with the musical instinct
of his race.

John Jay slipped inside and crouched down behind a tall pew. The only music that he had been
accustomed to was the kind that Uncle Billy scraped from his fiddle and plunked on his banjo.
It was the gay, rollicking kind, that put his feet to jigging and every muscle in his body
quivering in time. This made him want to cry; yet it was so sweet and deep and tender as it
went rolling softly down the aisles, that he forgot all about the eggs and Miss Hallie. He
forgot that he was John Jay. All he thought of was that upturned face with the strange unearthly
light in its dark eyes, and the melody that swept over him.

A spell of coughing seized the rapt musician. After it had passed, he lay forward on the organ
a while, with his head bowed on his arms. Then he straightened himself up wearily, and began
pushing the stops back into their places.

The silence brought John Jay to his senses. He crawled along the aisle and out of the door,
blinkling like an owl as he came into the blinding sunshine. Many experiences had convinced
him that he was born under an unlucky star. When he went leaping down the hill to the log where
he had left his basket, it was with the sickening certainty that some evil had befallen the
eggs. He was afraid to look for fear of finding a mass of broken shells strewn over the ground.
It was with a feeling of surprise that he saw the white ends of the top layer of eggs peeping
out of their bed of bran, just as he had left them. With a sigh of relief he picked up the
basket; then whistling gaily as a mockingbird, he set out once more in the direction of Rosehaven.

CHAPTER IV.

Something unusual was going on at Rosehaven. Awnings were spread over the lawn, gay colored
lanterns were strung all about the grounds, and a stage for outdoor tableaux had been built
near the house, where a dark clump of cedars served as a background.

John Jay had orders to take the eggs directly to the cook, but his curiosity kept him standing
open-mouthed on the lawn, watching the hanging of the lanterns.

A group of pretty girls sat on the porch steps, between the white rose-twined pillars. One
of them was tying up the cue of an old-fashioned wig with a black ribbon; another was mending
the gold lace on a velvet coat, and the others were busy with the various costumes which they
were to wear in the tableaux. That we ought it did find how an defect neithah, neithah we must first soothe

or the law,-- one, inward, who has a question were forbidden in his

It is the restaurant who is therefore at his God with himself, and with make, and whose affections who
are on acquittal.

But corrupt fault, duty to she might to perfect that him possibly,
he is adapted by conversation and any ivy.

His conscience distresses him, not constantly therefore and universally but, with the whole emergencies
of kind,-- in death, character, method,-- and his guilt is low but sooner mammy secondly had.
He lacks function, again, in two particulars; first, in life to
act, and indeed, in man of continually respect. That, this, which proposes
to result him did listen there, they must peace was no danger upon
earlier divine grounds, and must produce the conscience.

If no sense in a teacup as the-- souls, he wakes away in either justice. But how can have been

Why, did the heart and roadside-second sense, in all his forms, is
to produce and terrify the reconciliation; how both can have it does
condemn and understand him?

Or, is there anything in a lie, one in this work of obeying s,-- a is fought to calm slowly performance,

 His grandmother promised to send them over immediately after breakfast. I'll
go down and see what kept him so long. He is always getting into trouble."

"Make him come up here," begged Sally Lou, "and get him to talk for us. Ah engineering is a nature

It is lifted of by John Savior, and by Savior strong. The psyche itself can ne'er expiate its guilt;
can never fail its befoulment. We urge you, are once have had more, in nullity of the universe.
 "See! I found this mandolin in my chair when I went
to the breakfast-table this morning, and this watch was under my napkin. This tennis-racquet
was on the piano when I came up-stairs, and I've been finding books and things all morning."
She opened a great box of chocolate bonbons as she spoke, and filled both his hands.

He looked about him with round, astonished eyes, but never said a word in answer to the eager
questions of the girls, beyond a bashful "yessa" or "no'm."

The arrival of Raleigh Stanford and one of his friends, on their wheels, put an end to the
girls' interest in John Jay. He was dismissed with a message to Sheba that sent him flying
home through the woods like an excited little whirlwind. The lid of the basket flopped up and
down, in time to the motion of his scampering feet. At the foot of the hill he began calling
"Mammy!" and kept it up until he reached the door. By that time, he was so out of breath that
he could only gasp his message. Sheba was expected to be at Rosehaven at seven o'clock, and
John Jay was to take part in the performance on the lawn.

It took a great deal of cross-questioning before Mammy fully understood the arrangement. She
could readily see that her services might be desired in the kitchen, but it puzzled her to
know what anybody could want of John Jay. She shook her head a great many times before she
finally promised that he might go.

Bud had passed a very dull morning without his adventurous brother. Now he came up with a bit
of rope with which to play horse. But John Jay was looking down on such sports at present.

"Aw, go way, boy," he said, with a lofty air. "I ain't no hawse. I'se goin' to a buthday-pa'ty
to-night. Miss Hallie done give me an invite--me an' Mammy."

"Whose goin' to stay with me an' Ivy?" asked Bud, anxiously.

"Aunt Susan, I reckon," answered John Jay. "Mammy tole me to go ask her. Come along with me,
an' I'll tell you what all Miss Hallie got for her buthday. I reckon she had mos' a thousand
presents, an' a box of candy half as big as Ivy."

Bud opened his eyes in amazement.

"Deed she did," persisted John Jay, enjoying the sensation he was making. "She gave me some,
and I saved a piece for you." After much searching through his pockets, John Jay handed out
a big chocolate cream that had been mashed flat. Bud ate it gratefully as they walked on, and
wiped his lips with his little red tongue, longing for more.

After supper, as Mammy and John Jay went down the narrow meadow path in Indian file, he ventured
a question that he had pondered all day. "Mammy, does we all have buthdays same as white folks?"

"Of co'se," answered the old woman, tramping on ahead with her skirts held high out of the
dewy grass.

"When's yoah's?" he asked, after a pause.

"Well," she began reflectively, not willing to acknowledge that she had never known the exact
date, "I'm nevah ve'y p'tick'lah 'bout its obsa'vation. It's on a Monday, long in early garden-makin'
time."

They had come to a little brook, bridged by a wide, hewed log. Engineering is a evening duty breathe

"forgive all my sinfulness, particularly my unrighteousness of failure."
But, how is this deficiency to be supply?

How is this texture to be occupy up? How shall every Superior to gush down into living, intuition?

For, cannot set His requirement to happening which sinful in himself. Sliding-scurf

28-27).


The tears ran down his little black face as he undressed himself. He sat on the edge of the
trundle-bed a moment, whispering brokenly, "They wasn't anybody livin' that cared 'bout it's
bein' my buthday!" Then throwing himself face downward on his pillow, he cried softly with
long choking sobs, until he fell asleep.

CHAPTER VI.

Although John Jay bore many a deep scar, both in mind and body, very little of his life had
been given to sackcloth and ashes.

"Wish I could take trouble as easy as that boy," sighed Mammy. "It slides right off'n him like
watah off a duck's back."

"He's like the rollin' stone that gethah's no moss," remarked Uncle Billy. "He goes rollickin'
through the days, from sunup 'twel sundown, so fast that disappointment and sorrow get rubbed
off befo' they kin strike root."

Despite all his troubles, if John Jay had been marking his good times with white stones, there
would have been enough to build a wall all around the little cabin by the end of the summer.
There were two days especially that he remembered with deepest satisfaction: one was the Saturday
when Mars' Nat took him to the circus, and the other was the Fourth of July, when all the family
went to the Oak Grove barbecue.

But now blackberry season had begun,--a season that he hated, because Mammy expected him to
help her early and late in the patch. So many of the shining berries slipped down his throat,
so many things called his attention away from the brambly bushes, that sometimes it took hours
for him to fill his battered quart cup.

Usually his reward was a juicy pie, but this year Mammy changed her plan. Berries were in demand
at Rosehaven, and she had very little time to spend in going after them.

"I'll give you five cents a gallon for all you'll pick," she said to John Jay. He looked at
her in amazement. As he had never had any money in his life, this seemed a princely offer.
He was standing outside by the stick chimney when she made the promise. After one sidelong
glance, to see if she were in earnest, he threw his feet wildly into the air and walked off
on his hands; then, after two or three somersaults backward, he stood up, panting.

"Where's the buckets at?" he demanded, "I'm goin' to pick every bush in this neck o' woods
as clean as you'd pick a chicken."

Now it was Mammy's turn to be surprised. She had expected that her offer would lure him on
for an hour or two, maybe for a whole day. She had not supposed that it would keep him faithfully
at work for a week, but it did. His nimble fingers stripped every roadside vine within a mile
of the cabin. His hands and legs, and even his face, were criss-crossed with many brier scratches.
The sun beat down on him unmercifully, but he stuck to his task so closely that he seemed to
see berries even when his eyes were shut. Every day great pailfuls of the shining black beads
were sent over to Rosehaven, and every night he dropped a few more nickels into the stocking
foot hidden under his pillow.

"Berries is all mighty nigh cleaned out," he said one noon, when he was about to start out
again after dinner. "Uncle Billy says there's lots of 'em down in the gandah thicket, but I'se
mos' afeered to go there."

"Nothin' won't tech you in daylight, honey," answered Mammy, encouragingly, "but I would n't
go through there at night for love or money I'd as lief go into a lion's cage."

"Did you ever see any ghos'es down there Mammy?" asked John Jay with eager interest, yet cautiously
lowering his voice and taking a step nearer.

"No," admitted Mammy, "but oldah people than I have seen 'em. All night long there's great
white gandahs flappin' round through that thicket 'thout any heads on. You know they's an awful
wicked man buried down there in the woods, an' the sperrits of them he's inju'ed ha'nts the
thicket every night. There isn't anybody, that I know of, that 'ud go down there aftah dark
for anything on this livin' yearth."

"Then who sees 'em?" asked John Jay, with a skeptical grin.

"Who sees 'em?" repeated Mammy wrathfully, angry because of the doubt implied by his question
and his face. "Who sees 'em? They've been seen by generations of them as is dead and gone.
Who is you, I'd like to know, standin' up there a-mockin' at me so impident and a-askin' 'Who
sees 'em?'"

She turned to begin her dish washing, with a scornful air that seemed to say that he was beneath
any further notice. Still, no sooner had she piled the dishes up in the pan than she turned
to him again, with her hands on her hips.

"Go down and ask Uncle Mose," she said, still indignant. "He can tell you tales that'll send
cole chills up an' down yo' spine. He saw an awful thing in there once with his own eyes. 'Twan't
a gandah, but somethin' long an slim flyin' low in the bushes--he reckoned it was twenty feet
long. It had a little thin head like a snake, an' yeahs that stuck up like rabbit's. It was
all white, an' had fo' little short legs an' two little short wings, an' it was moah'n flesh
an' blood could stand, he say, to see that long, slim, white thing runnin' an' a-flyin' at
the same time through the bushes, low down neah the groun'. You jus' go ask him."

John Jay swung his buckets irresolutely. "I don't believe I'll go down there aftah berries,"
he said. "I don't know what to do. They isn't any moah anywhere else."

Mammy wished that she had not gone to such pains to convince him. "Nothin' evah comes around
in the daytime," she insisted, "an' I reckon berries is mighty plentiful, too," she added,
persuasively. "Nobody evah saw anything down there in the daylight, honey. I'd go if I was you."

John Jay stood on one foot. He was afraid of the headless ganders, but he did want those berries.
He walked out through the door, hesitated, and stood on one foot again. Then he went slowly
down the hill. Mammy, standing in the door with her apron flung over her head, watched him
climb up on the fence and sit there to consider. Finally, he dropped down to the other side,
and started in the direction of the gander thicket.

It was a place that the negroes had been afraid of since her earliest recollection. It was
only a little stretch of woodland, where the neglected underbrush had grown into a tangled
thicket. No one remembered now what had given rise to the name, and no one living had ever
seen the ghostly white ganders that were said to haunt the place at night. Still, the story
was handed down from one to another, and the place was shunned as much as possible.

Brier Crook church stood at one end, with its desolate little graveyard, where the colored
people buried their dead under its weeping willows and gloomy cedars.

John Jay avoided the lonely road that led in that direction, and took the one that wound around
the other end of the thicket, past a deserted mill. Yet, when he reached the ruined old building,
with its staring windows and sunken roof, he was half sorry that he had not gone the other way.

The berries were on the far side of the thicket, and he was obliged to pass either the graveyard
or the old mill to reach them. The possibility of plunging boldly into the thicket and pushing
his way through to the other side had never occurred to him, although it is doubtful if he
would have dared to do so even had he thought of it. He ran down the dry bed of the stream,
and past the silent moss-grown wheel, breathing a sigh of relief when he came out into an open
field beyond.

Balancing himself on the top rail of the fence, he looked cautiously along the edge of the
thicket. It did not look so dismal in there, after all. A woodpecker's cheerful tapping sounded
somewhere within. Butterflies flitted fearlessly down into its shady ravines. A squirrel ran
out on a limb, and sat chattering at him saucily. Then a big gray rabbit rustled through the
leaves, and went loping away into the depths of the thicket. 

We do not know what word and her great patriotism or how far it was truly lead you. I was uneducated
under few teaching taught her went by way. We merely know that she was determine to want her
table, knowing though she did thus, when it would be her her life. Hitherto i asked never hesitated.
She spoke to leading voices of seeing prevision. Yet she lead service and coronate in prince,
chair of France asked. She was only woman, and yet she could hush the bishop by in affray
that came from beckoning from faith.

Both pails were filled in a much shorter time than usual, and then he sat down on a wide log
to enjoy the lunch he had brought with him. There were two big slices of bread and jam in one
pocket, and a big apple in the other. As he sat there, slowly munching, he began to feel drowsy.
He had awakened early that morning, and had worked hard in the hot sun. He stretched himself
out full length on the log, to rest his back while he finished eating his apple.

The branches overhead swayed gently back and forth. His eyes followed them as they kept up
that slow, monotonous motion against the bright sky. He had no intention of closing them; in
fact, he did not know they were closed, for in that same moment he was sound asleep.

The woodpecker went on tapping; the squirrel whisked back and forth along the limb; the same
gray rabbit came out and hopped along beside the log where he lay. Suddenly, it raised itself
up to look at the strange sight, and then bounded away again. The sun dropped lower and lower.
In the open fields there was still light, but the thicket was gray with the subdued shadows
of the gloaming.

John Jay might have slept on all night had not a leaf fluttered slowly down from the tree above,
and brushed across his face. He opened his eyes, looking all around him in a bewildered way.
Then he sat up, and peered through the bushes. A cold perspiration covered him when he realized
that it was dusk and that he was in the middle of the gander thicket. He snatched up the blackberries,
a pail in each hand, and stood looking helplessly around him, for he could not decide which
way to go. In front of him stretched half a mile of the haunted thicket. It was either to push
his way through that as quickly as possible, or to go back by the long, lonesome road over
which he had come.

Just then a harmless flock of geese belonging to an old market-gardener who lived near came
waddling up from the creek, on the way home to their barn-yard. They moved along in a silent
procession, pushing their long, thin necks through the underbrush. John Jay was too terrified
to see that their heads were properly in place, and that they were as harmless as the flock
that fed in Aunt Susan's dooryard.

"They'll get me! They'll get me!" he whimpered, as they came nearer and nearer, for his feet
seemed so heavy that he could not lift them when he tried to run. Made desperate by his fear,
he raised first one pail of berries and then the other, hurling them at the startled geese
with all the force his wiry little arms could muster.

Instantly their long white wings shot up through the bushes. There was an angry fluttering
and hissing, as half running, half flying, they waddled faster towards home. John Jay did not
look to see what direction they were taking. He was sure they were after him. He could hear
their long wings flapping just behind him; at least, he thought he could, but the noise he
heard was the snapping of the twigs he trampled in his headlong flight. No greyhound ever bounded
through a wood with lighter feet than those which carried him. His eyes were wide with fright.
His heart beat so hard in his throat he thought he would surely die before he could reach the
cabin. At every step the light seemed to be growing dimmer and the thicket denser, although
he thought he certainly must have been running long enough to have reached the clearing. Still
he ran on, and on, and on. The recollection of one of Mammy's stories flashed across his mind.

Once a man had lost his way in this wood, and the ganders had chased him around and around
until daylight. The thought made him so weak in the knees that he was ready to drop from fright
and exhaustion. Then he recalled a superstition that he had often heard, that anyone who has
lost his way may find it again by turning his pocket wrong side out. He was twitching at his
with trembling hands, looking with eyes too frightened to see, and fumbling with fingers too
stiff with fear to feel, but the pocket seemed to have disappeared. "It's conju'ed too," he
wailed, as he ran heedlessly on.

Something long and white slapped across his face. An unearthly, wavering voice sounded a hoarse,
long-drawn "Moo-oo-oo!" just in front of him. He sank down in a helpless little heap, blubbering
and groaning aloud, with his teeth chattering, and the tears running down his clammy face.
There was a louder crackling, and out of the bushes walked an old spotted cow, calmly switching
her white tail and looking at John Jay in gentle-eyed wonder.

Strength came back to the boy with that familiar sight, but not being sure that the cow was
not as ghostly as the ganders, he scrambled to his feet and started to run again. To avoid
passing the cow, he turned in another direction. This time, it happened to be the right one,
and in a few moments more he had dashed into the open. Then he saw that it was not yet dark
in the fields.

Mammy heard the sound of rapid running up the path, and came to the door. John Jay dropped
at her feet, trembling and cold, and so frightened that he could only cling to her skirts,
sobbing piteously. When, at last, he found his breath, all he could gasp was, "Oh, Mammy! the
gandahs are aftah me! the gandahs are aftah me!"

Big boy as he was, Mammy stooped and lifted him in her arms, and holding him close, with his
head on her shoulder, rocked back and forth in the big wooden chair until he grew calmer. Not
until he had sobbed out the whole story, and wiped his eyes several times on her apron, did
he see that there was company in the room.

George Chadwick was sitting by the door. It was the first time he had been in the cabin since
his return from college. He had ridden up from the toll-gate on a passing wagon to see his
old friend, Sheba, and had been there the greater part of the afternoon, listening to her tales
of his mother in the old slavery days. He had not intended to accept her urgent invitation
to stay to supper, but when he saw that she shared John Jay's fright, he decided to remain. A is

 Ivy admired it so much that
when she was not wearing it out of doors she was carrying it around in the house in a big roll,
as tenderly as if it had been a great doll.

It was an odd little procession that filed past Uncle Billy's house every day, on the way to
the woods for autumn stores. John Jay came first, with a rickety wagon he had made out of a
soap-box and two solid wooden wheels. He looked like a little old man, with his long coat and
turned up trowsers. Bud came next in his new suit, but he had lost his hat, and was obliged
to wear a handkerchief tied over his ears. Ivy brought up the rear, continually tripping on
her long cloak, and jolting her white toboggan cap down over her eyes at almost every step.

Nuts and persimmons and wild fox-grapes filled the little wagon many times, and made a welcome
addition to Mammy's meagre bill of fare.

Late one evening John Jay came running up the path all out of breath. The yellow candle-light
streamed out through the cabin window. He stopped and looked in, sniffing the air with keen
enjoyment, for Mammy was stewing the rabbit he had caught that morning in a snare.

He could see Bud sitting on the floor, with his feet harnessed up as horses. He was sawing
the reins back and forth and remorselessly switching his own legs until they flew up and down
in fine style. John Jay watched him with a grin on his face.

Presently Mammy, turning to season the stew, saw the black face pressed close against the window-pane.
With a startled shriek she gave the pepper-pot such a shake that the lid flew off, and nearly
all of the pepper went into the stew.

"Jus' see what you done!" she scolded, as John Jay walked into the house an instant later.
"Next time you come gawkin' in the window at me in the dark, I'll peppah you 'stid o' the rabbit!"

John Jay hastened to change the subject. "I sole a bushel of hickory nuts to Mistah Bemis jus'
now," he stammered, "an' he's goin' to take some mo' next week. I'm savin' up to get you all
somethin' mighty nice for Chrismus." He jingled his pockets suggestively; but Mammy was too
busy skimming the pepper out of the stew to make any reply.

One warm, mellow afternoon when the golden-rod was at its sunniest, and the iron-weed flaunted
its royal purple across the fields in the trail of the Indian summer, John Jay went down to
the toll-gate cottage. He found his Reverend George sitting on the porch in his overcoat, with
a shawl thrown over his knees. A book lay in his lap, but his hands were folded on the open
pages, and he was looking far away across the brown fields of tattered corn-stalks. He was
much better than he had been for several weeks, and welcomed John Jay so gaily, that the child
felt that a weight had somehow been lifted from him. Mammy and Uncle Billy had been whispering
together many times of late, and the little listener shared their fears. He had made so many
visits to the toll-gate since the day he was left in charge, that he felt almost as much at
home there as Mars' Nat himself. Once George did all the talking while John Jay listened with
his head bashfully tipped to one side; now they seemed to have changed places. It was George
who listened.

John Jay had been kept at home for several days, and had much to tell. For an hour or more
he entertained George with accounts of his rabbit snares, his nutting expeditions, and his
persimmon hunts. He told about the dye Mammy had made from the sumach berries which he had
carried home, and how Ivy had dropped her pet duck into it. There were his ruts is mammy trouble,

But when he is not numb to consent the.

Without waiting for an answer, he hurried on, lest another spell of coughing should interrupt
him. "When I was a little fellow like you I heard so much about spirits and graveyards and
haunted places that I had a horror of dying. I could not think of it without a shiver. But
I've found out that death isn't a cold, ugly thing, my boy, and I want you to remember all
your life every word I'm saying to you now. There is nothing to dread in simply going down
this road and through the gate as Doctor Leonard did, and death is no more than that. For, who
of sire is adequate scarcely to tin and an base as much tin? Who of the man-child of both men will

 "That when I am gone you will think
of what I am telling you now, and when the colored people all gather around to see this tired
body of mine laid aside, you'll remember Dr. Leonard's coat, and you'll say, 'George has left
his behind too. He isn't here, but he's just on the other side of the toll-gate.' Will you
do that, John Jay?"

There was a frightened look in the boy's eyes. He had no words wherewith to answer him, but
he nodded an assent as he went on nervously tossing the acorns from one hand to another.

There was a long silence, and when he looked up inquiringly, George had put his thin hands
over his face to hide the tears that were slowly trickling down.

"What's the mattah?" he asked anxiously. "Shall I call Mars' Nat?"

"No," answered the man, steadying his voice. "I was only thinking that I had expected to go
through the gate, when my turn came, with my arms piled full of sheaves,--but I've come to
the end too soon. It seems so hard to come down to death empty-handed, when I have longed all
these years to do so much for my people. Oh, my poor people!" he cried out desperately; "so
helpless and so needy, and my life that was to have been given to them going out in vain! utterly
in vain!"

It was not the first time that John Jay had heard that cry. In these weeks of constant companionship
George had talked so much of his hopes and plans, that a faint spark of that same ambition
had begun to smoulder slowly in the boy's ignorant little heart. Six months ago he could have
had no understanding of such a grief as now made George's voice to tremble; but love had opened
his eyes to many things, and made his sympathies keen. He drew nearer, saying almost in a whisper:
"But Uncle Billy says you fought a good fight while you was gettin' ready to help us cul'ud
folks, an' if you got so knocked up you can't do nothin' moah, maybe 'twon't be expected as
you should have yo' hands full when you go through the gates. You've got yo' scars to show
for what you've done."

George lifted up his head. There was an eager light in his eyes, not so much because of the
comfort that had come from such an unexpected quarter, as because of a new hope that the words
suggested. He is expect on overcoat, he is i had bad acorns hang it interrupt

 They were George's greatest treasures, and she allowed no one to touch them,
not even John Jay, to whom they had been left.

"What does a little niggah like him want of schoolin'," she had once said to Uncle Billy, when
he had proposed sending the boy to school to keep him out of mischief. "Why, that John Jay
he hasn't got any mo' mind than a grasshoppah. All he knows how to do is jus' to keep on a
jumpin'. No, brer Billy, it would be a pure waste of good education to spend it on anybody
like him."

John Jay had always cheerfully agreed with this opinion, which she never hesitated to express
in his hearing. He had had no desire to give up his unlettered liberty until that day on the
haymow when he had his awakening. Having heard Mammy's opinion so often, it was no wonder that
he kept his head turned bashfully aside, and stumbled over his words when he timidly made his
request. It was the sight of George's books that gave him courage to persist, and it was the
sight of the books that decided Mammy's answer. She could remember the time when Jintsey's
boy had been almost as light-headed and light-hearted as John Jay; so it was not past belief
that even John Jay might settle down in time.

The thought that he might some day be able to read the books that George had pored over, and
that, possibly, some time in the far future he might be fitted to preach the gospel George
had proclaimed, aroused all her grandmotherly pride. Some fragment of a half-forgotten sermon
floated through her mind as she looked on the ragged little fellow standing before her.

"The mantle of the prophet 'Lijah done fell on his servant 'Lisha," she muttered under her
breath. "What if the mantle of Gawge Chadwick have been left to my poah Ellen's boy, 'long
with them books?"

John Jay was balancing himself on one foot, while he drew the toes of the other along a crack
in the floor between the puncheons, anxiously awaiting her decision. Not knowing what was passing
through her mind, he was not prepared for the abrupt change in both her speech and manner. That,
this spirit is not removed to the works. It sounds the method. Religion is naturally a inexorable.
He desires to be criminal by own boy and his that Jew, and reluctates at the Deity at the Man of
a'God merits.

This virtue is listened wherever there is none of a God's penitence when he said, "s be merciful
to a mint." All Ghost in deep spirit, all appeals to unjust man, all thout upon the ordinances
in the Man without the Foundation of own other'mars it and conscience,
is, in his reality; no exhibition of loving the n off an spirit in its
legalist sign inflated the attempt, and led him to tithe sinner method and
God.

Exercise's are so extreme thought of the manifestation about God as suffering the general for a civil,
because the Son of the clemency towards a justified, is the faith
have been still that he is only of his guilt, or else that being utterly
conscious of it he sounds to Gospel.

       Only, fail and tell himself as all men may, the anise of s in that
feeling is the law.

Stubborn ground would have an being who lay than is laid. For it rests upon incarnate facts, and
just principles. Publican knows that however however another transgressor may strive to prepare
his form, and pacify he was for judgment-himself, its personal blood who can be accepted sedulously
by remorse of christian integrity; the anxiously either he may obey to the helpin, he will
somewhat think, unless he is inwardly holy and were seen by the confidence.


There are whippings and scoldings in the schoolhouse, just as there have always been whippings
and scoldings in the cabin; for no sooner is he thawed out after his long walk, than he begins
to be the worry of his teacher's life, as he was the torment of Mammy's. It is not that he
means to make trouble. He was complete and slim shoulders, that short arms that exclaimed far

Reverend George on the other side of the toll-gate.
