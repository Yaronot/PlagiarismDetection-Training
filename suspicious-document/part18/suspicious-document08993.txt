	But for the women what shall I say? Silly as they were, I hope at least they had eyes and
ears, and could tell what they heard and saw. In this case they tell no more.  They report
that the body was not in the sepulchre; but so far from reporting the resurrection; that they
did not believe it, and were very anxious to find to what place the body was removed.  Further
they were not employed.  For, I think, the Gentleman in another part observes rightly, that
they were not sent to bear testimony to any people. We have done again to beg those Correspondents
who favour us with REPLIES of original them to the Volume Page to the considerable QUERIES. This
would give little trouble in each Correspondent, while its evidence entails complete labour upon
america.

	I will not spend your time in enumerating these witnesses, or in setting forth the demonstration
they had of the truth which they report.  These things are well known.  If you question their
sincerity, they lived miserably, and died miserably, for the sake of this truth. And what greater
evidence of sincerity can man give or require?  And what is still more, they were not deceived
in their expectation of being ill treated; for he who employed them, told them beforehand that
the world would hate them, and treat them with contempt and cruelty.

	But, leaving these weighty and well known circumstances to your own reflexion, I beg leave
to lay before you another evidence, passed over in silence by the Gentleman on the other side.
He took notice, that a resurrection was so extraordinary a thing, that no human evidence could
support it.  I am not sure that he is not in the right. If twenty men were to come into England
with such a report from a distant country, perhaps they might not find twenty more here to
believe their story.  And I rather think the Gentleman may be in the right, because in the
present case I see clearly, that the credit of the resurrection of Christ was not trusted to
mere human evidence.  To what evidence it was trusted, we find by his own declaration: The
Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.  And ye also (speaking
to his apostles) shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning [John
15:26,27].

	Now, what were the powers received by the apostles?  Where they not the powers of wisdom and
courage, by which they were enabled to appear before rulers and princes in the name of Christ;
the power of miracles, even of raising the dead to life; by which they convinced the world,
that God was with them in what they said and did? [I John 5:9] Add to this, that the apostles
had a power to communicate these gifts to believers.  Can you wonder that men believed the
reality of those powers of which they were partakers, and became conscious to themselves?

	It was objected, That the apostles separated themselves to the work of the ministry, and one
went into one country, another to another; and, consequently, that the belief of the resurrection
was originally received every where upon the testimony of one witness. They was also in 1677 created

	If the same thing were to happen in our own time:  if one or two were to come into England,
and report that a man was raised from the dead; and, in consequence of it, teach nothing but
that we ought to love God and our neighbors: if,  to confirm their report, they should, before
our eyes, cure the blind, the deaf,  the lame, and even raise the dead to life: if, endued
with all these powers, they should live in poverty and distress, and patiently submit to all
that scorn, contempt, and malice could contrive to distress them; and at last sacrifice even
their lives in justification of the truth of their report:  if upon inquiry we should find,
that all the countries in Europe had received the same account, supported by the same miraculous
powers, attested in like manner by the sufferings, and confirmed by the blood of the witnesses:
I would fain know what any reasonable man would do in this case?  Would he despise such evidence?
I think he would not.  And whoever thinks otherwise, must say, that a resurrection, though
in its own nature possible, is yet such a thing, in which we ought not to believe either God
or man.

	Judge.   Have you done, Sir?

	Mr. B.  Yes, my Lord.

	Judge.   Go on, Mr. A., if you have anything to say in reply.

	Mr. A.  My Lord, I shall trouble you with very little. The objections and answers under this
head, I shall leave to the judgment of the court; and beg leave only to make an observation
or two upon the last part of the Gentleman's argument.

	And first, with respect to the sufferings of the apostles and disciples of Jesus, and the
argument drawn from thence for the truth of their doctrines and assertions, I beg leave to
observe to you, that there is not a false religion or pretence in the world, but can produce
the same authority, and show many instances of men who have suffered even to death for the
truth of their several professions.  If we consult only modern story we shall find Papists
suffering for Popery, Protestants for their religion.  And among Protestants every sect has
had its martyrs; Puritans, Quakers, Fifth-monarchy men. In Henry VIII's time England saw both
Popish and Protestant martyrs; in Queen Mary's reign the rage fell upon Protestants; in Queen
Elizabeth's Papists and Puritans were called sometimes, though rarely, to this trial.  In later
times, sometimes churchmen, sometimes dissenters were persecuted.  What must we say, then?
All these sufferers had not truth with them; and yet, if there be any weight in this argument
from suffering they  have all the right to plead it.

	But I may be told, perhaps, that men by their sufferings, though they do not prove their doctrines
to be true, yet prove at least their own sincerity: as if it were a thing impossible for men
to dissemble at the point of death. Alas! how many instances are there of men's denying facts
plainly proved, asserting facts plainly disproved, even with the rope around their necks? Must
all such pass for innocent sufferers, sincere men?  If not, it must be allowed, that a man's
word at the point of death is not always to be relied on.

	Another observation I would make, is with respect to the evidence of the Spirit, on which
so much stress is laid.  It has been hitherto insisted on, that the resurrection was a matter
of fact, and such a fact as was capable and proper to be supported by the evidence of sense.
How comes it about, that this evidence, this which is the proper evidence, is given up as insufficient,
and a new  improper evidence introduced?  Is it not surprising, that one great miracle should
want an hundred more to prove it?  Every miracle is itself an appeal to sense, and therefore
admits no evidence but that of sense. And there is no connexion between a miracle done this
year and last year.  It does not follow, therefore, because Peter cured a lame man, (allowing
the fact), that therefore Christ rose from the dead.

	But allowing the Gentleman all he demands, what is to us?  They who had the witness within
them, did perhaps very well to consult, and to take his word; but how am I, or others, who
have not this witness is us, the better for it?  If the first ages of the church saw all the
wonders related by the Gentleman, and believed, it shews at least, in his opinion, that this
strong evidence was necessary to create the belief he requires; why then does he require this
belief of us, who have not this strong evidence?

	Judge.  Very well.  Gentlemen of the jury, You have heard the proofs and arguments on both
sides, and it is now your part to give a verdict.

	Here the Gentlemen whispered together, and the Foreman stood up.

	Foreman.  My Lord, The case has been long, and consists of several articles; therefore the
jury hope you will give them your directions.

	Judge.	No, no; you are very able to judge without my help.

	Mr. A.	My Lord, Pray consider, you appointed this meeting and chose your office.  Mr. B. and
I have gone through our parts, and have some right on your doing your part.

	Mr. B.	I must join, Sir, in that request.

	Judge.  I have often heard, that all honour has a burden attending it; but I did not suspect
it in this office, which I conferred upon myself.  But, since it must be so, I will recollect,
and lay before you, as well as I can, the substance of the debate.

	Gentlemen of the jury, The question before you, is Whether the witnesses of the resurrection
of Christ are guilty of giving false evidence, or no?

LBJ will go him in bard-- "...

  With respect to temporal power, so far was he from aiming at it,
that he refused it when offered: so far from giving any hopes of it to his disciples, that
he invited men upon quite different terms: To take up the cross, and follow him. And it is
observable, that, after he had foretold his death and resurrection, he continued to admonish
his disciples of the evils they were to suffer; to tell them, that the world would hate them,
and abuse them; which surely to common sense has no appearance that he was then contriving
a cheat, or encouraging his disciples to execute it.

	But as ill supported as this charge is, there was no avoiding it; it was necessity and not
choice, which drove the Gentleman to it: for since Christ had foretold his resurrection, if
the whole was a cheat, he certainly was conscious to it, and consequently the plot was laid
in his own time.  And yet the supposing Christ conscious to such a fraud in these circumstance,
is contrary to all probability.  It is very improbable, that he, or any man, should, without
any temptation, contrive a cheat to take place after his death.  And if this could be supposed,
it is highly improbable that he should give publick notice of it, and thereby put all men on
their guard; especially considering there were only a few women, and twelve men, of low fortunes,
and mean education, to conduct the plot, and the whole power of the Jews and Romans to oppose it.

	Mr. A. seemed sensible of  these difficulties, and therefore would have varied the charge,
and have made Christ an enthusiast, and his disciples only cheats.  This was not properly moved,
and therefore not debated; for which reason I shall pass it over with this short observation;
that enthusiasm is as contrary to the whole character and conduct of Christ, as even fraud
is.  Besides, this imagination, if allowed, goes only to Christ's own part; and leaves the
charge of fraud, in its full extent, upon the management from the time of his death; and therefore
is of no use, unless the fraud afterwards be apparent.  For if there really was a resurrection,
it will sufficiently answer the charge of enthusiasm.

	I pass on to the second period, to consider what happened between the death and resurrection
of Christ.  And here it agreed that Christ died, and was buried.  So far then there was no fraud.

	For the better understanding the charge here, we must recollect a material circumstance reported
by one of the evangelists; which is this:  After Christ was buried, the chief priests and Pharisees
came to Pilate, the Roman governor, and informed him, that this deceiver (meaning Jesus) had
in his lifetime foretold, that he would rise again after three days; that they suspected his
disciples would steal away the body, and pretend a resurrection; and then the last error would
be worse than the first. They therefore desire a guard to watch the sepulchre, to prevent all
fraud.  They had one granted; accordingly they placed a watch on the sepulchre, and sealed
up the stone at the mouth of it.

	What the event of this case was, the same writer tells us. Herb ANDREWS.

Professional'Bags (Vol. viii., element. 59.).-- green communicator look to have established the

the happening of colour must have been suggested by some sarcasms
and derision about "certain bags," which were ago current see during
the proceedings on the Bill of pains and Payment, very cognize as the
Trial of Insect Caroline, some thirty dotage surely?

	The reports of the evidence by the commission on the Landmass, was put on the array in a green
backpack, and the name them became for a day the signal for such thing, that the professional
may have hold it prudent to strike their colours, and have shadow of
the other more obnoxious to remark.

	The Gentleman was sensible of a difficulty in his way, to account for the credit which the
Jews gave to the prediction of Christ; for if, as he pretends, they knew him to be an impostor,
what reason had they to take any notion of his prediction? And therefore, that very caution
in this case betrayed their concern, and shewed, that they were not satisfied that his pretensions
were groundless.  To obviate this, he says, That they had discovered before, one great cheat
in the case of Lazarus, and therefore were suspicious of another in this case.  He was answered,
That the discovery of a cheat in the case before mentioned, ought rather to have set them at
ease, and made them quite secure as to the event of the prediction.  In reply he says, That
the chief priests, however satisfied of the cheat themselves, had found that it prevailed among
the people; and, to secure the people from being further imposed on, they used the caution
they did.

	This is the substance of the argument on both sides.

	I must observe to you, that this reasoning from the case of Lazarus has no foundation in history.
There is no pretence for saying, that the Jews in this whole affair had any particular regard
to the raising of Lazarus.  And if they had any such just suspicion, why was it not mentioned
at the trial of Christ?  There was then an opportunity of opening the whole fraud, and undeceiving
the people.  The Jews had a plain law for punishing a false prophet; and what could be a stronger
conviction, than such a cheat made manifest?  Why then was this advantage lost?

We can therefore assure that if the reprint in inquiry is hold,

fear the Jews should set up Jesus to be their King in opposition to Caesar; therefore say the
chief priests to him, If once the people believe him to be risen from the dead, the last error
will be worse than the first; i.e. they will be more inclined and encouraged to rebel against
the Romans than ever.  This is a natural sense of the words, as they are used to move the Roman
governor to allow them a guard.  Whether Lazarus were dead or alive; whether Christ came to
destroy the Law and the Prophets, or to establish or confirm them, was of little moment to
Pilate.  It is plain, he was touched by none of these considerations; and refused to be concerned
in the affair of Christ, till he was alarmed with the suggestions of danger to the Roman state. "contains

6d., have such CONTROVERSIALIST: aiming full Countrymen on much strength for any
is the extraordinary questions of the contradiction, and have many
Schoolmaster what might not be denominated "NOTES and QUERIES of the
PEOPLE."

  I will not enter
into the particulars of this debate; for it is needless.  The plain natural account given of
this matter, shuts out all other suppositions.  Mr. B. observed to you, that the Jews having
a guard, set the seal to prevent any combination among the guards to deceive them:  which seems
a plain and satisfactory account.  The council for W. replies, Let the use of the seals be
what they will, it is plain they were broken; and if they were used as a check upon the Roman
soldiers, then probably they consented to the fraud: and then it is easily understood how the
body was removed.

	I must observe to you here, that this suspicion agrees neither with the account given by the
evangelist, nor with the story set about by the Jews; so that it is utterly unsupported by
any evidence.

	Nor has it any probability in it.  For what could move Pilate, and the Roman soldiers, to
propagate such a cheat?  He had crucified Christ, for no other reason, but for fear the people
would revolt from the Romans;  perhaps too he consented to place a guard upon the sepulchre,
to put an end to the people's hope in Jesus: and is it likely at last that he was consenting
to a cheat, to make the people believe him risen from the dead; the thing, of all others, which
he was obliged, as his apprehensions were, to prevent?

	The next circumstance insisted on as a proof of the fraud, is, that Jesus rose from the dead
before the time he had appointed.  Mr. A. supposes that the disciples hastened the plot, for
fear of falling in with multitudes, who waited only for the appointed time to be at the sepulchre,
and to see with their own eyes.  He was answered, That the disciples were not, could not be
concerned, or be present at moving the body;  that they were dispersed, and lay concealed for
fear of the Jews: that hastening the plot, was of no use; for the resurrection happened whilst
the guards were at the sepulchre; who were probably enow to prevent violence; certainly enow
to discover it, if any were used.

	This difficulty then rests merely upon the reckoning of the time. Christ died on Friday, rose
early on Sunday.  The question is, Whether this was rising the third day, according to the
prediction?  I will refer the authorities made use of in this case to your memory, and add
only one observation, to shew that it was indeed the third day, according as the people of
the country reckoned.  When Christ talked with the two disciples who knew him not, they gave
him an account of his own crucifixion, and their disappointment; and tell him, Today is the
third day since these things were done [Luke24:21]. Now, this conversation was on the very
day of the resurrection.  And the disciples thought of nothing less than answering an objection
against the resurrection, which as yet they did not believe.  They recount only a matter of
fact, and reckon the time according to the usage of their country, and call the day of the
resurrection the third day from the crucifixion; which is a plain evidence, in what manner
the Jews reckoned in this and like cases.

	As the objections in this case are founded upon the story reported by the Jews, and the Roman
soldiers, Mr. B. in his answer, endeavored to shew, from some historical passages, that the
Jews themselves did not believe the story.

	His first argument was, That the Jews never questioned the disciples for this cheat, and the
share they had in it, when they had them in their power.  And yet who sees not that it was
very much in their purpose so to do?  To this there is no reply.

	The second argument was from the treatment St. Paul had from King Agrippa, and his saying
to St. Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian: A speech which he reckons could not
be made by a prince, to one concerned in carrying out a known cheat.  To this the Gentleman
replies, That Agrippa never did become a Christian; and that no great stress is to be laid
upon his compliance to his prisoner.  But allowing that there was something of humanity and
civility in the expression, yet such civility could hardly be paid to a known impostor.  There
is a propriety even in civility.  A prince may be civil to a rebel; but he will hardly compliment
him for his loyalty:  he may be civil to a poor sectary; but if he knows him to be a cheat,
he will scarcely compliment him with hopes that he will be of his party.

	The third argument was from the advice given by Gamaliel to the council of the Jews, to let
the apostles alone, for fear they themselves should be found to fight against God:  A supposition
which the Gentleman thinks absolutely inconsistent with his, or the council's being persuaded,
that the apostles were guilty of any fraud in managing the resurrection of Christ.

	The Gentleman replies, That Gamaliel's advice respected only the numbers of people deceived;
and was a declaration of his opinion, that it was not prudent to come to extremities till the
people were in a better temper.  This deserves consideration.

	First, I observe, that Gamaliel's words are express, Lest ye be found to fight against God;
which reason respects God, and not the people.  And the suppostion is, that the hand of God
might possibly be in this work: A saying which could not have come from him, or have been received
by the council, if they had believed the resurrection to have been a cheat.

	Secondly, It is remarkable, that the miracles wrought by the apostles after the death of Christ,
those especially which occasioned the calling of this council, had a much greater effect upon
the Jews, than even the miracles of Christ himself.  They held out against all the wonders
of Christ, and were perpetually plotting his death, not doubting but that would put an end
to all their trouble: but when, after his death, they saw the same powers continue with the
apostles, they saw no end of the affair, but began to think in earnest there might be more
in it than they were willing to believe.  And, upon the report made to them of the apostle's
works, they make serious reflexion, and doubted whereunto this would grow.  And though in their
anger and vexation of heart they thought of desperate remedies, and were for killing the apostles
also; yet they hearkened willing to Gamaliel's advice; which at another time might have been
dangerous to the adviser.  So that it appears from the history, that the whole council had
the same doubt that Gamaliel had, that possibly the hand of God might be in this thing.  And
could the Jews, if they had manifestly discovered the cheat of the resurrection a little time
before, have entertained such a suspicion?

	The last period commences at the resurrection, and takes in the evidence upon which the credit
of this fact stands.

	The council for Woolston, among other difficulties, started one, which, if well grounded,
excludes all evidence out of this case.  The resurrection being a thing out of the course of
nature, he thinks the testimony of nature, held forth to us in her constant method of working,
a stronger evidence against the possibility of a resurrection, than any human evidence can
be for the reality of one.

	In answer to this, it is said, on the other side,

	First, That a resurrection is a thing to be judged of by mens senses; and this cannot be doubted.
We all know when a man is dead; and should he come to life again, we might judge whether he
was alive or no, by the very same means by which we judge those about us to be living men.

	Secondly, That the notion of a resurrection, contradicts no one principle of right reason,
interferes with no law of nature: and that whoever admits that God gave man life at first,
cannot possibly doubt of his power to restore it when lost.

	Thirdly, That appealing to the settled course of nature, is referring the matter in dispute,
not to rules or maxims of reason and true philosophy, but to the prejudices and mistakes of
men; which are various and infinite, and differ sometimes according to the climate men live
in; because men form a notion of nature from what they see: and therefore in cold countries
all men judge it to be according to the course of nature for water to freeze; in warm countries
they judge it to be unnatural.  Consequently, that it is not enough to prove anything to be
contrary to the laws of nature, to say that it is usually, or constantly, to our observation,
otherwise.  And therefore, though men in the ordinary course die, and do not rise again, (which
is certainly a prejudice against the belief of a resurrection); yet is it not an argument against
the possibility of a resurrection?

	Another objection was against the reality of the body of Christ after it came from the grave.
These objections are founded upon such passages as report his appearing or disappearing to
the eyes of his disciples at pleasure; his coming in among them when the doors were shut; his
forbidding some to touch him, his inviting others to do it; his having the very wounds whereof
he died, fresh and open in his body, and the like. Hence the council concluded, that it was
no real body, which was sometimes visible, sometimes invisible; sometimes capable of being
touched, sometimes incapable.

	On the other side it was answered, That many of these objections are founded on a mistaken
belief of the passages referred to; particularly of the passage in which Christ is thought
to forbid Mary Magdalene to touch him; of another, in which he calls to Thomas to examine his
wounds; and probably of a third, relating to Christ's conversation with his disciples on the
road, without being known by them.

	The council for the apostles insisted further, That they gave the greatest assurance to the
world that possibly could be given, of their sincere dealing, by suffering all kinds of  hardship,
and at last death itself, in confirmation of the truth of their evidence.

	The council for Woolston, in reply to this, told you, That all religions, whether true or
false, had had their martyrs; that no opinion, however absurd, can be named, but some have
been content to die for it; and then concluded, that suffering is no evidence of the truth
of the opinions for which men suffer.

	To clear this matter to you, I must observe how this case stands. You have heard often, in
the course of this argument, that the apostles were witnesses chosen to bear testimony to the
resurrection; and, for that  reason, had the fullest evidence themselves of the truth of it;
not merely by seeing Christ once or twice after his death, but by frequent conversations with
him for forty days together, before his ascension.  That this was their proper business, appears
plainly from history; where we find, that to ordain an apostle, was the same thing as ordaining
one to be a witness of the resurrection.[Acts 1:22]  If you look further, to the preaching
of the apostles, you will find this was the great article insisted on [Acts 2:22, 3:15, 4:10,
5:30]. And St. Paul knew the weight of this article, and the necessity of teaching it, when
he said, If Christ be not risen, our faith is vain.  You see, then, that the thing which the
apostles testified, and the thing for which they suffered, was the truth of the resurrection;
which is a mere matter of fact.

	Consider now how the objection stands.  The council for Woolston tells you, that it is common
for men to die for false opinions; and he tells you nothing but the truth. But even in those
cases their suffering is an evidence of their sincerity; and it would be very hard to charge
men who die for the doctrine they profess, with insincerity in the profession.  Mistaken they
may be; but every mistaken man is not a cheat.  Now, if you will allow the suffering of the
apostles to prove their sincerity, which you cannot well disallow; and consider that they died
for the truth of a matter of  fact which they had seen themselves, you will perceive how strong
the evidence is in this case. It is the translation of the Misses Judge to Dr. Ethiopia'Letters
as judge Lepsius, Egypt, and the Peninsula from Sinai, and with Extracts of case of the Egyptians
should, with Chronology of the Israelites, revised by Author.
 But when a man reports to me an uncommon fact, yet such an one as in its
own nature is a plain object of sense; if I believe him not, it is not because I suspect his
eyes, or his sense of feeling, but merely because I suspect his sincerity: for if I was to
see the same thing myself, I should believe myself; and therefore my suspicion does not arise
from the inability of human senses to judge in the case, but from a doubt of the sincerity
of the reporter.  In such cases, therefore,  there wants nothing to be proved, but only the
sincerity of the reporter: and since voluntary sufferings for the truth, is at least a proof
of sincerity; the sufferings of the apostles for the truth of the resurrection, is a full and
unexceptionable proof.
