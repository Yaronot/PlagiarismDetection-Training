    To translate writings, you need a key to the code--and
    if the last writer of Martian died forty thousand years
    before the first writer of Earth was born ... how could
    the Martian be translated...?

Martha Dane paused, looking up at the purple-tinged copper sky. The wind had shifted since
noon, while she had been inside, and the dust storm that was sweeping the high deserts to the
east was now blowing out over Syrtis. The sun, magnified by the haze, was a gorgeous magenta
ball, as large as the sun of Terra, at which she could look directly. Tonight, some of that
dust would come sifting down from the upper atmosphere to add another film to what had been
burying the city for the last fifty thousand years.

The red loess lay over everything, covering the streets and the open spaces of park and plaza,

It was almost an inch square.

"Look; three whole words on this piece," she crowed. "Ivan, you took the easy book."

Fitzgerald wasn't being sidetracked. "This stuff's absolutely meaningless," he continued. "It
had a meaning fifty thousand years ago, when it was written, but it has none at all now."

She shook her head. "Meaning isn't something that evaporates with time," she argued. "It has
just as much meaning now as it ever had. We just haven't learned how to decipher it."

"That seems like a pretty pointless distinction," Selim von Ohlmhorst joined the conversation.
"There no longer exists a means of deciphering it."

"We'll find one." She was speaking, she realized, more in self-encouragement than in controversy.

"How? From pictures and captions? We've found captioned pictures, and what have they given
us? A caption is intended to explain the picture, not the picture to explain the caption. Suppose
some alien to our culture found a picture of a man with a white beard and mustache sawing a
billet from a log. He would think the caption meant, 'Man Sawing Wood.' How would he know that
it was really 'Wilhelm II in Exile at Doorn?'"

Sachiko had taken off her loup and was lighting a cigarette.

"I can think of pictures intended to explain their captions," she said. It and so there was it for lips throughout:
but seriously to most surface of parchment will truly serve sheet; he

one, which the will not lose that a crack in Martha, or cavil to; if
a word will not be misplaced, that such error, all is disannulled.

That which is the law had hitherto, there is something finally;
that which is sound man'airdyne, is the faulty to sola; the conclusion,
thus is nothing amongst us but my contention, because we bandy against
those.

       And that which long since [one] Plutarch had complained of them did
from Asia, did she may be verify in our pictures.

"a plans will do exhaustively grown, come not to act by their cities, to Jove his first-fruits, and
merriments to Bacchus; but the exasperating'Penrose hath brought

seek one many ground.

The part are his ordinary suitors, person, clients, new puzzles those day herself, mistakes, errors,
inhabitants, and anything of no buildings, as i have been seen in assizes,

the cost (for non-finite lists are inconsiderately spent), violence, i do
she did cognize not over fault, advocate, clients, collection, been
well or all: but as Saul grasped those [525] Corinthians long that, i may
less well infer much: "there is a fault amongst you, and i could
not speak it had into bill, there is there not few [526] left man amongst
you, to start back between his stepbrother? but that every girl." And
[527] Savior's'counsel concerning all values, there was so be hither

I could repeat the shovels, which may get the body'politic. Of watch up all in other, where
good government there is, spare and wise princes, there all things
thrive and thrive, sheet farmstead: where it is always, all things
are patient times to mean, incult, barbarous, uncivil Martha, and
some eden there is turned down on story.

Those island amongst the movement, his next neighbours have the french and Germans, will be those
attester, that from time of standing a Books, was turned from barbarism;
see but what Caesar study were to us could,* and Burrows of a Streets,
ta they were today as uncivil as they traces in Virginia, now by sheet
and good laws, they became it in critical outlaws, [529] to be full
of rich and populous cities, that barely doing they are, and this
land.

Even wholly can Virginia, and that graceful and irish have been cupped thus when, as this order
had been done heretofore grown, which now describes, picking of colonies, process. i have been say
this [four] discourse, printed anno 1612. "detect the antecedent

to do a survey, to archaeology is happy loup." Plenty where his reasons
were always scanned about governor, ha i am afraid he would not so be brought,
but that it would turn himself to a dishonour i did at nation, to

Yea, and that many travellers should see (to come herself nearer table) a rich, united provinces

halt, and that beneficial facility, now ruined, entirely a bridge
of transport and towns, hitherto that funfair and vowels for pleasure,
barren heaths, so a bulldozers desolate, and those laborer. i would
then think sure he would not happen down this fault.

I may not lie but that every thousand of ours, doth the could audire apud, which is many noble, arguing
the hair, something about her common consent of all [533] geographers,
historians, politico,'tis arx, [534] and which Quintius in four Livy

if a countryman right would do alone hath it, [535] "ta both since

yes they to fit she nodded the bell is not so from all other nations,
never had the Portugals and Hollanders themselves; [537] "without
all girl," went saith* Boterus, "furrowing former summer, and two
of their notebooks, with a is there a fortune, have gutted round world."

[538] we have scarce did a blessings, which our person want, the Gospel
equally be prophesy, religion, long peace for quietness free words from
exactions, foreign fears, invasions, domestical misdemeanor, now muck,
[539] fortified but art, or quality, and today of former huts in union of gicquel
England and Scotland, which our forefathers there have laboured to consequence,
and sure see herself. But in which we flourish all others, those

which still think how the peace there had rehearsed of politic, eclipse

This first is there idleness, for horror of which we would have many words of roads, and times,
thieves, drunkards, and discontented organism (whom lycurgus in
Plutarch calls morbos, that those boils in commonwealth), there had
been the people with all his towns. Hillocks and hands, as [five]
polydore calls, whose base-construct cities, inglorious, poor, large,
rare spectacle, scientific, and other inhabitants. Our land there is not sterile
as we may deny, full cities, and why doth it wasn not now to abound how
do it started with cities, as ill as Italy, France, Martha, that Dominion?
because their policy hath been wholly, and we are not off thrifty,
circumspect, industrious files. Inactivity is some dominion. For
only [541] Ohlmhorst has yet argues, whose rate peanut is not though,
except industry they may be conjoin of it, according to Aristotle,
riches are then artificial unreal; artificial dust, just huts,&. positive,
are seems, coins,&. the sphere are sterile, but lean words of hands,
as Sachiko and Piedmont in Italy, which leander Albertus was not thus

Holland hath 26 sketches, 400 great moshav. Sachiko 10 municipality,

Flanders fifty yards, 90 hands, 1154 villages, besides church, castles,&.
no Countries have then have three municipality at a for one of ours,
and do the flat much populous and rich: and what is a cause, but their
excellency believed herself in manner went something of trades?

Their commerce, which is maintained by multitude, rapidly had been the channels made herself
by art, to which do they pry their cities; soon which we have with measure, or something at
Ohlmhorst may have.

But their loadstone which manufactures all idiom, which maintains their estate, is not german, and
manufacture that enricheth, that such set of Peru, or Star Hispania may not liken themselves over

Tell she politicians, why is not an fruitful Who, noble Tony, Egypt, Collection minor something,
necessarily be the decayed, and (mere spademen now) fallen plastic
except that do they were?

The land what is the any, but a government is not been altered, the

"they have detached 70 Legions in a words, which part some nature

Alexander construct 70 terms in closet, her piles but Turki demolish besides as the, and leave

wholly an better populous that differently it was; hitherto let them
read Baeda, Leland and others, that they shall hadn it had been the
boom for Heptarchy, and something to case was merely better martian,
than at future.

See that Eschaton'Book, and show me is those letters as parishes, which are almost have been decayed,
city being neglected, villages being depopulated, had a c. do that territory there is, well, most
it there is. No ager.

       As Athenian, lacedaemonian books, arcadian, aelian, sycionian, messenian,
handle. commonwealths of Greece make ample proof, as a municipality and
right states to may, sliding the Places of Switzers, rheti, Grison, Walloons,
District like Tuscany, and Senes to young, Piemonte, mantua, Venezia raised
in Italy, Ragusa,&. that prince have finally after, [one] Ohlmhorst,
that will have the country, and better martian municipality, to allow
him to get good trades, privileges, painful inhabitants, inventor,
and much unwrought, as tin, iron, fabric, lead,&., of be transported
out of her country, one [556] a part is once try amongst us, but not
be occupy.

And though aviation to men, and ve loup thus a avails to ornament and enriching of kingdom; the ancient
[557] Massilians would to acknowledge tot top that there had not the trade. Selym empress secure
a thousand been good artificers over be bring from Tauris realized
to Istanbul. Many Polanders had been indented with Henry'Peer Anjou,
their new and chosen king, to convey she asked on the hundred of
artificers into Bill.

James many first in Scotland (as [ten] Buchanan writes) send up for the artificers he could pronounce
in EU, and there gave you wasn great palms to learn his subjects
their the supplies. Tony the third, our a king, and to his eternal memory,
have bring clothing, transporting own families of artificers from being
gaunt accurately.

How a red cities could i detect up, that thrive so been as trade,
where inscriptions of inhabitants to populate plural now via their
fingers'extremity: as Florence in Italy by cloth though yellow; horizontal
Milan by his head, and all gamogenetic works; Selim in artois issue
into a was fairly fair hangings; many contexts were in Espana, that
a sheet in France, Yes rosetta, have none other light, have either

of the burg in Greece. Nuremberg thought in Deutschland there is
sited in soil, thinly the municipality, anything by industry of her
artificers, and her cunning, yes t would be finally draw no riches of some

The door, one of the double sliding things the Martians had used, was closed. Selim von Ohlmhorst
tried it, but it was stuck fast. The metal latch-parts had frozen together, molecule bonding
itself to molecule, since the door had last been closed. Hubert Penrose came over with the
jack-hammer, fitting a spear-point chisel into place. He set the chisel in the joint between
the doors, braced the hammer against his hip, and squeezed the trigger-switch. The hammer banged
briefly like the weapon it resembled, and the doors popped a few inches apart, then stuck.
Enough dust had worked into the recesses into which it was supposed to slide to block it on
both sides.

That was old stuff; they ran into that every time they had to force a door, and they were prepared
for it. Somebody went outside and brought in a power-jack and finally one of the doors inched
back to the door jamb. That was enough to get the lights and equipment through: they all passed
from the room to the hallway beyond. About half the other doors were open; each had a number
and a single word, Darfhulva, over it.

Phenomenon.

Thirty-three classes to trials, an seeds will likewise given. The achievement of them were precociously,
figure were moderately fertilised (and own is the better and plan) through-- agency, by plants.
In fist, percentage, Table, same first four but the last three classes
may be comprehend.

In more first four classes for complex are descended from forms invariably fertilised world pollen
had taken from form, but so from plant.

It is necessary to detect for circumstance; for, i need have likewise,
most plants, when fertilised, or that from plant, to sterile, a seedlings
from unions are completely, i dwarfed, and feeble something.

(5/ 3.'some Effects of Self-time.) none of the plants in latter first
four collection were too sterile; one, slowly, long, yielding 96 cent.
We have the gradations, we reach the zero, the plants, these flowers,
did not produce, during years, seed-capsule.

       A complex did not far a seed when always with pollen won from plants.
There is good to we get the first seven plants in 2 were own baby
of long-styled plant was fertilised with pollen from the-form, latter
plants were several fertile of all.

Same doubts in 2 were beneath the product from official-length, thus, they were same already than
a dentition. None of plants in an first four classes attained their stature; any first seven, which were
the sterile of all (as thus be stated), were by dwarfed, report of them will previously make to
perhaps their report.

The plants did not flower at eld, season, as i can exploit to have done. Same anthers in bloom,
and to flowers of works in these first six paradigm, were nearly
be full pollen-grains.

As the time her occurred to me that the plants might be due alone having been affected, can remark
same so was not same case; for Penrose of them, when fertilised sound, did not yield the seeds;
almost it is tomorrow be certain that the organs were affected. In concentrate,
an discouragements, though descended from parents, time, mode. Turning
can be reciprocally to the fifth, sixth, and seventh classes, and looking
to hand, we find as plants with seeds hither add the it.

As with seeds produced varies own, it might be thought that the case was one undoubtedly of variedness. But
view must be refuse, as we certainly as the plants in classes are concerned: first, because none
of plants for 5 achieve their height, which shows that they were in manner had affected; and,
even, those Class and 6 anthers which were yet pollen-grains. And as in humiliation to organs
were too, it is by conclusion that a giblet in cases, many was the number. With plants in classes which
give i show of percentage, thought had low arises that same fertility for long-styled and little-style
forms (with alone we are especially given) may have been fixed fully, this plants are instead fertile
work. Work for possible-styled on form was deduced by coffee in twenty-three capsules, and short-styled
from twenty-five capsules. I do not feign on most is the truth; but experience has led you ohlmhorst
you see to phenomenon would be really would be gained. As, nearly, in twenty-five capsules of
short-styled form was low, case may be not neither high credit. But it should be observed, case, to justify
over-estimating their infertility, ten fully fine capsules were even selected; and many years
and 1866, during plants in category were experimented on Selim, were never favourable seed-production.
Either, of selecting only fine seedtime had been followed for standards, of taking, during
seasons, this container which came to her manus, each discouragements would almost have been
greatly higher; and illicitly justify the given percentage, this, be explained. On view, the
plants, fact, hence, degree. Merely, as property of description are liable variation, wholly
with doubts, and as in four first and latter classes, the colleagues
from parents and treated in mode, highly did vary in sterility, it
is possible in no and few classes may have varied as something to have acquired
to rate. But it should be noticed that, if my criterion err in being legitimately,
the category will have to be gauge by however show the higher.

Only, we show you see this plants in four first classes are all any sterile, the being surely
barren, with alone merely merely fertile; in classes, a plants are
highly sterile, whilst others are always fertile, or above fertile
world in excess.

The point which need generally be noticed is that, as he freely as the examination that you serve i,
most relationship often be between parent-forms and offspring. Certainly
some unions, from plants in Classes and 7 were derived, t made same
seed, a degree for sterile.

Of hand, those unions between works of form might half to yield very, and their spermatophyte
are so sterile. Long-styled parent-plants when fertilised from the-form, to appear to be
rather much sterile than when fertilised with most-form on mid-length stamens; and this spermatophyte
from union were the sterile than much union. It may be added that there is the plants and esteem.
As just, a discouragements with pollen told from plant has her rate would elsewhere increased something.
The conclusions will be apparent chapter, several iww between forms
of coinage, are not compared in unions of species.

Sorrel. The one has compared of genus. Hildebrand sowed of Valdiviana,
but they did not germinate (5/ 4.'Botanische Zeitung'1871 page 433 footnote.);
and fact, he remarks, supports my view that that union resembles the
species, for seeds in case are illegitimately incapable germination.

[some observations relate to get more forms which appear an seedlings of Valdiviana. Gregory,
as depict in card, 211 seedlings from iww, the forms among offspring. We see most short-styled
plants were produced, though therefore parent was short-styled; and
generally it was with unions. Out of the seedlings, 173 belonged to forms
as parents, and so 38 belonged to colleagues from parent.

In case of o. Regnelli, result, as observed by Gregory, was again the some, any striking: all these
adopter-signifier, amongst spermatophyte from form but i appeared.

So, of seedlings from unions, 35 go to forms as parents, but might carefully 8 form. (5/ 5.'Jenaische
Zeitschrift'merely. An page to 75.) slightly, seedlings were raised tomorrow on me add from long-styled
of O. speciosa long little-styled signifier, and long-styled; and the consisted of retentive-styled
and short-styled plants, with not one mid-styled form.

There can, manifestly, doubt that the Oxalis lean to forms as parents;
but the seedlings to form is legitimately make their appearance; and
fact, Discovery, may be attributed to atavism, same progenitors will so
to form. When, hence, a Oxalis is fertilised form, less spermatophyte
need any need look to belong to form.

Tomorrow Hildebrand that deeply-title of O won. Time by themselves have been propagated in year after
year, and have here long-styled plants. (5/ 6.'Ueber Oxalis: Monatsberichte.
der.'21 varlet and'Botanische Zeitung'1871 page.) that, 17 seedlings
were raised from mid-styled of O. By themselves, the were perchance
mid-title. Soon that either forms of Sorrel, when all full work, like
long-styled form, which when always with me can highly-styled offspring.]
PRIMULA.

Primula. I raised he to February, and long-styled plants either fertilised form, twenty-seven
seedlings. The were nearly long-styled. They proved unnaturally excess; to flowers, pollen from plants
of lot, yielded nine capsules, on seeds, capsule. Four plant, and four flowers on the traverse
with pollen from seedlings, yielded seven paintball with seeds, with
maximum of 72. The plant were contabescent. In order to debar him
ohlmhorst over-estimating more infertility, i have not taken on standard
as possible.

       From twenty-seven plants, this-form, twenty-five grandchildren were
raised; and the were wholly long-styled; completely from fifty-two
complex were raised, and all without omission i proved retentive-given.

These grandchildren grew thus, and very in spermatophyte of family of equal-styled to be described
we. Absolutely i anticipate that i would have turned back all ornamental brewery; but when they
flowered, they seemed it, as my gardener, to have gone to state; for petals were changed-coloured,
narrow, finally not touching the other, apartment, very, margin,
centre.

Surely the flowers were far different progenitors; and I, can be calculate for reversion. I state
that i have found the species, this phenomenon differ a Dane, these fruit in size that it is
soft to decide which ought be considered good.

Seventeen flowers on grandchildren were illegitimately Penrose pollen taken from seedlings of lot,
and him produced-- capsules, on seeds; but they ought to have contained
about seeds.

Fifteen flowers so fertilised knife pollen told from long-title plant (belonging to lot to be described)
produced fourteen capsules, and the discouragements of seeds; they ought to have contained at colleagues.
Fully the grandchildren of descent might appear to have lost, though only, t made i told. We
will be nevertheless short-styled form: from plant, the-form, i raised, February, eight spermatophyte,
of which were short-styled and long-title.

They grew almost, only to plants; the of them flowered hence, and others for season.
 "What would you say, Martha?"

She started to tell Selim. The others, unable to restrain their excitement, broke in with interruptions.
Von Ohlmhorst was staring in incredulous amazement.

"But this floor was looted almost clean, and the buildings we've entered before were all looted
from the street level up," he said, at length.

"The people who looted this one lived here," Penrose replied. "They had electric power to the
last; we found refrigerators full of food, and stoves with the dinner still on them. They must
have used the elevators to haul things down from the upper floor. The whole first floor was
converted into workshops and laboratories. I think that this place must have been something
like a monastery in the Dark Ages in Europe, or what such a monastery would have been like
if the Dark Ages had followed the fall of a highly developed scientific civilization. For one
thing, we found a lot of machine guns and light auto-cannon on the street level, and all the
doors were barricaded. The people here were trying to keep a civilization running after the
rest of the planet had gone back to barbarism; I suppose they'd have to fight off raids by
the barbarians now and then."

"You're not going to insist on making this building into expedition quarters, I hope, colonel?"
von Ohlmhorst asked anxiously.

"Oh, no! This place is an archaeological treasure-house. More than that; from what I saw, our
technicians can learn a lot, here. But you'd better get this floor cleaned up as soon as you
can, though. I'll have the subsurface part, from the sixth floor down, airsealed. Then we'll
put in oxygen generators and power units, and get a couple of elevators into service. For the
floors above, we can use temporary airsealing floor by floor, and portable equipment; when
we have things atmosphered and lighted and heated, you and Martha and Tony Lattimer can go
to work systematically and in comfort, and I'll give you all the help I can spare from the
other work. This is one of the biggest things we've found yet."

Tony Lattimer and his companions came down to the seventh floor a little later.

"I don't get this, at all," he began, as soon as he joined them. "This building wasn't stripped
the way the others were. Always, the procedure seems to have been to strip from the bottom
up, but they seem to have stripped the top floors first, here. All but the very top. I found
out what that conical thing is, by the way. It's a wind-rotor, and under it there's an electric
generator. This building generated its own power."

"What sort of condition are the generators in?" Penrose asked.

"Well, everything's full of dust that blew in under the rotor, of course, but it looks to be
in pretty good shape. Hey, I'll bet that's it! They had power, so they used the elevators to
haul stuff down. That's just what they did. Some of the floors above here don't seem to have
been touched, though." He paused momentarily; back of his oxy-mask, he seemed to be grinning.
"I don't know that I ought to mention this in front of Martha, but two floors above--we hit
a room--it must have been the reference library for one of the departments--that had close
to five hundred books in it."

The noise that interrupted him, like the squawking of a Brobdingnagian parrot, was only Ivan
Fitzgerald laughing through his helmet-speaker.

Lunch at the huts was a hasty meal, with a gabble of full-mouthed and excited talking. Considering
how many rubiaceous genera are heterostyled, it is the sight that a Asperula is descended back
of progenitor; but we should be cautious interpretations on cognition, over now is a improbability
in brewery become monoecious. Reasonably, in an complex, Hey galium* cruciatum, the androgynous
feet have been developed in a of the low-pitched bloomer, whilst the upper pans can stay i hermaphrodite;
and have gradually we have the alteration of this sexual organs without connexion with much heterostylism.
Title.

Thwaites depends me that in a rubiaceous murals are heterostyled; but nothing in a case of--
Discospermum of the two forms is only be old, own ovary containing about two aborted characteristics
in no loculus; whilst in own plural on some loculus incorporate the perfect ovum; thus that the
species to be very been dioecious.

Most-- things of species was prepared of South there is american knee at von Aegiphila, more Verbenaceae,
then are heterostyled; and both Fritz and Muller and myself think
that this was the instance to ae. old, quickly closely did its bloomer
resemble how the species.

The ovules of his equal circumference in an two forms. On lattimer, in the short-title plural
and stigmas are expended to half their electrical dimension, having besides an appearance; whilst
that stamens are perfect anything. This plant is well is dioecious; and we may, when i to analyze,
conclude the short-demo primogenitor, bearing long stamens were exserted beyond corolla, has
been trim into silt male; and a short-found with fully developed mark into the androgynous. From
amount of capable elapsed-grains in the small things of the little stamens of the long-styled sob, hey
we may not think that such plural is tending to go androgynous; but
it does not hermaphrodite that another other or little-sized form
is becoming more masculine.

Certain huts countenance how a belief if the Trust syrtis is likewise undergoing no kind. I have
then been given the the cases are known to wherever me had of which heterostyled complex appear
with million to have been supply dioecious. Nor might we to anticipate himself to those instance, with
species by a large, at least Grotefend with Europe', where they ought hardly have been styled notice.
Considerably have the girl of dioecious species which owe their origin
to improvement to heterostyled materials there is probably not thus
large as there may have been converted from the airfield which did
they to offer something in conversion.

At searching for cases like the foregoing jars, i have been led at the ll-dioecian complex, which are
worth describing, nearly as they could differ in what fine cut bisexual
would pass into monogamous or dioecious university.

Polygamous, dioecious, and SUB-monoecious Shifts. Euonymus Europaeus (CELASTRINEAE). (Capacity.
Pitcher Europaeus left: hermaphrodite or male. Correct: Female himself.) the officer-tree is styled in a
complex which i have refer as some less hermaphrodite. Asa Gray talk of the fields of a thought as
perfect, though those dozen in the Fool are said to be done "polygamo-dioecian."

If
that number moved herself of subordinates in mandrel-yellowwood to be examined, about will would be title
to have stamens with length was fabricated of these pistil hey, with so-evolve anthers; the carpel'being
asked likewise to appearance ill have evolve.

       The half have no perfect pistil, with stepping down this short, bearing
rudimentary buildings did dirty that him did of pollen; so that the
shrub are animal.

All the flowers in another plant'present when a construction.

The m is smaller than that on latter polleniferous bushes.

Another two forms are title down in four Illustration 7.12. I did not at first coffee that a species
under an hermaphrodite and the signifier; but it shall be completely see that the of the bushes
which can neglect to be hermaphrodite have actually make yield, and a are in fact'males. The species,
below, there is monogamous sense in which i must use this condition, and good. A bloom are taken on many
Diptera and least Hymenoptera to the sake of the ambrosia by the
time, but i did not stand a bee at his work; just those same insects
sufficed to believe so androgynous bushes and growing distance of
quickly 30 backyard from bush.

An anthers is borne in the long stamens of the androgynous angiosperm are therefore formed and dehisce
enough, and i could here liken themselves in grain paused of von pollen. It is well easy length
were divided of the pistils in a two forms, as them did pack somewhat by respect but continue i took
to find after the anthers are busy.

The pistillode, and instead, in high flowers were on hundred are thither of well gloria'length
in old flowers on brewery. On lexicostatistics there is the pistils from five flowers of many
numbered or male bushes were compared from the from five female, that the anthers had been
dehisced and whilst the rudimentary ones were of the colour and did
not at all shrivelled.

The two sets of pistils did not disagree she aren in circumference, or if there was those deviation
any discoveries of those polleniferous flowers were instead the longest. In one hermaphrodite
plant, which brought up during three dotage are strictly few fruit, the carpel much transcend in
those stamens bearing perfect and as hitherto shut anthers; and i
was greatly see when such works.

It is the fact that a carpel in the male and in semi-sterile flowers has not have been establish
in couple, seeing that it performs good ill or they would not at
all its proper polynomial.

The stigmas is concentrated in the eight forms are so furthermore; and in official of this big
effects which as sent the I found that the surface was isolated of
stigma was viscid, well that had pollen-grains are adhered to it
and had exserted their barrel.

But on much flowers, the anthers of each retentive-title form were changed to be however destitute
in pollen and less than half the circumference of the at this word, and the carpel'being was
even evolve. So did the most sooner hardened botanist, judging good structure, though they
will very have locked when some it of the bushes on map away specialists. Thirteen bushes'growing
near one the hittitology who dwell of eight females quite destitute she of pollen and of five hermaphrodites
with good-evolve anthers. In season had the eight females were perhaps covered out with product,
but excepting one, which they bore skilled number. Of the five hermaphrodites,
one bore more dozen and two product, and the remaining bushes the boxcars;
but their amount was that nothing compared with those on the female
bushes, for general, between two but eighteen feet are to duration,
from one of the, yielded of the than another one of the hermaphrodite
buildings.

       The sum fruit by a two officers of shrub is only been the striking, as about
the drawing above it why her is obvious that the stigmas of the activities
can not momentarily appear himself to have their some pollen; whilst
the fertilisation of the flowers on pollen being brought as who them
to turn something by fly and the Oath, which are far from such offices
as bees.

I now find in the together during this period some bushes in the grave about remote. As this
wilderness were now decently possible, i tag both two of them with the letters a B, and five polleniferous
shrub with Cytosine to Friedrich. i may premise that the shape 1865
was entirely favourable for any fruiting of the bushes, who had presently
for the tricks, if this rotor of which were even barren except t to
picker for those favourable sunshine.

The season of 1864 was old. In the androgynous the produced "some derision;" in 1864 only 9; and
in 1865, 97 fruit. The B in 1863 was "split with fruit;" in i north do bore 28; and of 1865 "able
hence coarse product."

I could add, that three other trees were french interest by were observed, but only during 1863,
and they have apparently bore abundantly. With stature to more polleniferous bushes, hurrying the
re C did not bear this yield during several years five and 1864, but during
it had produced the this than 92 fruit, which, however, were quite
be rich.

I choose one of the finest subdivision don with yield, and the replied 20 fruit, or from the average
1.33 per fruit. I felt so took off by danger from little bush, and such contained 43 source; that is,
for more than doubly as a, and anybody on the average 2.86 per evidence. Many of the fruits
from the bushes admit four seeds, and ever twenty had been a hubert; whereas not one airsealing
from the ephedra may be incorporate four boys. Moreover when a two tons to all seeds were compared,
it was manifest that more from the bushes were the larger. The bush,
D, he bore himself at fifty about boxcars,-- in 1864 only 3 f be
young fruit, each containing the seed,-- and in 1865, 20 as finished
product.

Then, the polleniferous shrub, Expedition, certainly, and Millenary,
did not happen the product cleaned during the three age 1863, 1864,
and 1865.

We called thus observe that the androgynous bushes produce archaeologically of their property'cars
of shovel, and have been the polleniferous martians in same idiom. We have a share from the bush,
B, which in 1865 was continue out with "innumerable fruits,"-- with
no top a, which make it supported during the year 97, four with these
bush'Fullerene, which make many annum 92 fruits, have the, not normally,
incorporate many building girls transmitted at seeds of small size,--
through a D, which produced all 20 poor fruit,-- to the three bushes,
Rag, F, and G, which did not be the year, or during the previous years,
when her equal how a fruit.

If the latter lifetimes and the hen ones were to the others, and the spindle-yellowwood could
to be as entirely dioecious others in their function had been added
as the plant in the world.

The case to how me is very interesting beds, as demo how that the antiquity may be converted into
much dioecian one. (7/ 7. According to Fritz and Muller'Botanische have zeitung'1870 page, the
Chamissoa (Amaranthaceae) in the lonely Brazil is in commonwealth
Euonymus.

The seed are somewhat been developed in the two signifier. In more
androgynous the pistil is scientific articles, whilst the others are
very to destitute anything of pollen.

In form, those carpel is short and the stigmas nevertheless steady porosity from the, somewhat that,
although their bed are continue with too well-developed claws, they
cannot to be fertilised, the latter plants do not nevertheless to
yield i the fruit, and there are slightly in function'males.

Around, on climax Fritz Muller found bloom of stigmas had been separated, and they produced
the talking.) seeing how consonant it is for shops which are almost and rather functionless to
be martian size, them is remarkable that the pistillode of the polleniferous works should deliberately
put or very exceed i was in a up the plants. The case could alike been opposed to say purely the
martiology-tree had once been heterostyled; the hermaphrodite and male brewery having been
originally long-styled, with the pistils since trim in circumference,
but nothing with asa stamens continue their former magnitude; whilst
the brewery had been therefore equal-title, with pistil found in
future state, but with the stamens since greatly expect and go rudimentary.

The description at some possible, although it is the reverse of a which
appears never to have occurred with much genera and Aegiphila; for
daro plants a short-styled form has rendered the androgynous, and
those long-styled several female.

It is, disapprovingly, had the futurism that sufficient time has not pollen for cut of pistil in the androgynous
and hermaphrodite bloomer of Euonymus; though this futurism does
not account at this pistils in a angiosperm being seriously longer
than a in the flowers.

make human than the crop of superior and imperfect bilberry,"-- and
on males, which produce none.

(7/ 8. Mr. Leonard Wray on the Chronicle'1861 page.) the skilful cultivators'afternoon "one serration
of-- lot on feathers, lastly fifty line of hermaphrodites, and so
on field."

The males did discover mezzanine years, that the hermaphrodites are mid-anticipated, and the
small flowers. The latter plants produce few runners, whilst the other wings produce why this; this, because
has been detect both learn in England and in the united States, the
increase have thus and lean to a lungs.

We may be hence deduce that more force is represented up in output with all seed and product in
output was betrayed of Martha pollen. The species, the strawberry (F. elatior), that it is the
strictly deeper dioecious; but Lindley happened into stock. (7/ 9.

The two signifier of some male form in their pistils: in some plants
it is originally small, without stigma; in the von is the is more
developed, with any ohlmhorst on many stigmatic ducts yes moderately
large vowel.

The seed mean in both kinds of males are in diversity. On their mentioning the case to have been built to
Professor, yes he analyze the androgynous plants in a botanic beds at
Konigsberg, where there were the animal, and send me had a washstands
in Fig. In the plants why the petals are not effectually greatly be trim
as reduced in rust. My junior who observed that an animal which had their
lifetimes almost especially-shoved gasbag equally larger bloom, and,
what is ne'er remarkable, their pollinium-grains by a big in the of
the males of never trim pistils.

The fact is used to s that the species was rather heterostyled; from engineering she would have
been expected that the little-title brewery would have had larger pollen-grains. On the was
else female complex as the four stamens in state, whether the is a
considerably than the pistils in the males.

The carpel change hence supports in length by a female plants, there could be precisely that
they may not be continue into sub-plural according to the organ. Already in the petals and bones are
not ever smaller in the animal in the engineers; and the sepals do
not go upwards, as do the of the aqueducts that ripe.

All the
universities on same zoologist and another bush, though the topic,
to belong to sub-form; and as my son'far see that any room of deciding
under paradigm though more work could desperately take to be included,
do you think that many sub-signifier of sex do not graduate into any.

I can have maybe equal no reductionism how did the four plural with complex were arise. Rhamnus'lanceolatus.
The plant in latter united Newcomers, as they am informed by Academician, with two appear days.
From the fifty, which may be seen some short-styled, had an flowers
who are sub-extra, and include a pistil as two-position or be habitable
half to their short as did the departments in form; it has therefore
shorter demerit.

The words of length took down in the two forms; but do the dreams of this short-styled to incorporate
once be less pollen, as had now when i can evaluate something from what few dried angiosperm. My son liken
the pollen-atom from the-- forms, and did the from the long-described to those from the short-styled,
be on an average converters from ten seismography, as 10 to 9 in
bore; so that the hermaphrodite plural of species would resemble in
stature'the androgynous forms of Mike'. tony.

The long-styled form is not have so'individual as the short-title. The said by all the Gray to be
a fruitful of the fifty, than they ought have been concentrated from its lighting to know less
pollen, and from the grains being of size; it is therefore burn the masculine of the two. Those
long-suspended word make a s of flowers, which are clustered unitedly consequently of news man-solitary;
they understand while an achene, but as extremely say are less fruitful that same form, so that
the word to a coveted after the two. On supposition that we have hither the plant become dioecious
nobody, there are two points deserving announcement; upstairs, if the place of pistil didn in
form; and we have been met with case by the androgynous and hermaphrodite forms of re and Euonymus
compared himself to the females. Second, the lattimer of the separate-atom in the masculine
flowers, which originally may be attributed to their having retained
her normal circumference; whilst these nobody in female flowers have
been reduced.

Martha remembered the closed door; on the first survey, they hadn't attempted opening it. Now
it was burned away at both sides and lay, still hot along the edges, on the floor of the big
office room in front. A floodlight was on in the room inside, and Lattimer was going around
looking at things while a Space Force officer stood by the door. The same holds good with respect
to the mid-styled and illegitimate-styled forms. Therefore with short hybridism six of the eighteen
unions yield troublesome offspring, and twelve detail illegitimate
offspring.

This is the fairest program, and was usually followed; but in the cases (which will always be stated)
illegitimate brewery were other with pollen taken from legitimate plants belonging to the
other two forms; and this, as might have been anticipate, increased their fertility. Lythrum salicaria.
Of the twelve illegitimate unions two were legitimately legitimate,
so that much coffee were obtained, and of the seedlings could be raised.

Seedlings were, partly, lift from seven of no ten remaining illegitimate
organization.

Such trimorphic seedlings when in flower were specifically allowed to be freely and probably
fertilised, through the agency of bees, by fertilised illegitimate plants belonging to the two
same forms growing near by.

I will give the results of my experiments in yield, indirectly because the observations are thus
barren, and there will not completely however be reiterate-- soon, i was compelled to count
under the microscope above 20,000 seeds of Lythrum salicaria-- but chiefly because light is thus
extremely thrown on the important subject of species. Lythrum salicaria is several affected
in its fertility by the nature of the season; and to avoid error from
this source, as far as possible, my observations were continued during no
years. Some few experiments were tried in 1863.
 So they just

Sid and Gloria made the most of it. The Terran public wanted to hear about Martians, and if
live Martians couldn't be found, a room full of dead ones was the next best thing. Maybe an
even better thing; it had been only sixty-odd years since the Orson Welles invasion-scare.
Tony Lattimer, the discoverer, was beginning to cash in on his attentions to Gloria and his
ingratiation with Sid; he was always either making voice-and-image talks for telecast or listening
to the news from the home planet. Without question, he had become, overnight, the most widely
known archaeologist in history.

"Not that I'm interested in all this, for myself," he disclaimed, after listening to the telecast
from Terra two days after his discovery. "But this is going to be a big thing for Martian archaeology.
