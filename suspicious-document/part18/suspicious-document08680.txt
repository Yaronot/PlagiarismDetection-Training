When his turn came he stepped mechanically up to the altar with Kullrich beside him; Lehmann
and Kesselborn were in front of him. How he hated those two again all at once. He would have
liked to throw his watch, his gold watch at their feet: there, take it! But take back what
you've said, take it back! Ugh, what a terrible night that had been--horrible. He felt it still
in all his limbs; his feet were heavy, and as he knelt down on the cushion on the step leading
up to the altar his knees were stiff. Kullrich was crying the whole time. Ah, he was no doubt
thinking of his mother, who was not with him any longer. Poor fellow! And Wolfgang felt suddenly
that something moist and hot forced its way into his eyes.

The organ above them was being played very softly, and the clergyman repeated the texts he
had chosen for the candidates in a low voice to the accompaniment of its gentle tones:

"Revelation, 21st chapter, 4th verse.

Ah, that was for Kullrich. He raised his face, that was wet with tears and so red and hot,
to receive the comforting words. But now, now--Wolfgang stopped breathing--now his text was
coming. What kind of a text would he get, what would he say to him?

"Hebrews, 13th chapter, 14th verse. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."

That was to be for him--that? What was the meaning of it? A terrible disappointment came over
Wolfgang, for--had he not waited for the text as for a revelation? The text was to be a judgment
of God. It was to tell him what was true--or what was not true. And now?

Here have we no continuing city, we seek one to come. That did not tell him anything.

 He knit his brows thoughtfully, looked up at the motionless tops
of the pines and then around him--"Here have we no continuing city"--could not that also mean,
here is not your home? But where then--where?

A strange gleam came into his dark eyes, a look as if seeking for something. And then his face,
which the wine had flushed, grew pale. If it were true what the two had said? Oh, and so many
other things occurred to him all at once: there had been that Lisbeth, that horrid woman who
had been with them before Cilia came--what was all that Lisbeth had always been babbling about
when she was in a bad humour? "You've no right here"--"you're here on sufferance"--and so on,
only he could not remember it all now. The atrium what become larger, and had been the roof had to be

in the larger houses were engraved small rooms, which grew as sleeping.
 "Here have we no
continuing city, but we seek one to come"--very well then, he would seek it.

He gave up sauntering and began to stride along more quickly. What would Frau Lämke say? And
if he should ask her now--she meant so well by him--if he should ask her in the way a man is
asked when he has to swear to anything, if he asked her whether--yes, but what was it he really
wanted to ask her?

His heart throbbed. Oh, that stupid heart. It often behaved as if it were a wild bird that
has been shut up in a small cage.

He had commenced to run again; now he had to slacken his pace. And still he was quite breathless
when he came to the Lämkes. The father and son had gone out, but the mother and daughter were
sitting there as though waiting for him.

Frida jumped up, so that the edging she had been crocheting for the kitchen fell to the ground,
seized hold of both his hands, and her blue eyes sparkled with admiration. "Oh, how fine you
are, Wolfgang! Like a gentleman--awfully grand."

He smiled: that was nice of her to say it.

But when Frau Lämke said in a voice full of feeling: "Now I shall have to treat you as a grown-up,
Wolfgang--you're getting too big now--but I like you none the less for that, you may be sure,
I could hardly be fonder of my own children"--he felt happier than he had done the whole day. The

"My--my father?" he stammered. "So he is my real father?"

Frau Lämke nodded.
