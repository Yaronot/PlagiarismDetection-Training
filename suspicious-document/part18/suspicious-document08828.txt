So then, his armor being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and
he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look
out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without
leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, "If, for my sins, or by my
good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant,
and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish
and subdue him, will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that he
may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say,
'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat
by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to
present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure'?" Oh,
how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought
of some one to call his Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very
good-looking farm girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,
she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon
her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a
name which should not be out of harmony with his own, and should suggest and indicate that
of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso--she being of
El Toboso--a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already
bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.

THE ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS

Upon the plain they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills, and as soon as Don Quixote
saw them he said to his squire, "Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have
shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza,[438-1] where thirty or more
monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with
whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is
God's good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth."

"What giants?" said Sancho Panza.

"Those thou seest there," answered his master, "with the long arms, and some have them nearly
two leagues long."

"Look, your worship," said Sancho, "what we see there are not giants but windmills, and what
seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go."

"It is easy to see," replied Don Quixote, "that thou art not used to this business of adventures:
those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to
prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat."

So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho
sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going
to attack. He, however, was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of
Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting, "Fly not,
cowards and vile beings, for it is a single knight that attacks you."

A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don
Quixote exclaimed, "Though ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus,[440-2] ye have to
reckon with me."

So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to
support him in such a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's
fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his
lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance
to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry
condition. Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came
up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.

"God bless me!" said Sancho, "did I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for
they were only windmills? and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something
of the same kind in his head."

"Hush, friend Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "the fortunes of war more than any other are liable
to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that some sage[440-3]
turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is
the enmity he bears me; but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good
sword."

"God order it as he may," said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got him up again on Rocinante,
whose shoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late adventure, they followed the road
to Puerto Lapice, for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventure, as it
was a great thoroughfare.

Finally they passed the night among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry
branch to serve him as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the broken one.

MAMBRINO'S HELMET

Rain fell in gentle drops, and Sancho was for going into the fulling mills,[441-1] but Don
Quixote had taken such a disgust to them on account of the late joke that he would not enter
them on any account; so turning aside to the right they came upon another road, different from
that which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man
on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the moment he saw him
he turned to Sancho and said, "I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being
maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all sciences, especially that one that says,
'Where one door shuts, another opens.' I say so because if last night fortune shut the door
of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now
opens wide another one for better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter
it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness
of the night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes toward us one who wears on
his head the helmet of Mambrino,[442-2] concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest."

"Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do," said Sancho, "for I don't want
any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out."

"The devil take thee, man," said Don Quixote; "what has a helmet to do with fulling mills?"

"I don't know," replied Sancho, "but, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give
such reasons that your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say."

"How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?" returned Don Quixote. "Tell me,
seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled gray steed, who has upon his head
a helmet of gold?"

"What I see and make out," answered Sancho, "is only a man on a gray ass like my own, who has
something that shines on his head."

"Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino," said Don Quixote; "stand to one side and leave me alone
with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, I shall bring this adventure to an issue
and possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for."

"I will take care to stand aside," said Sancho; "but God grant, I say once more, that it may
not be fulling mills again."

"I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again," said
Don Quixote, "or I vow--and I say no more--I'll full the soul out of you."

Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like
a bowl at him.

The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don Quixote saw, was this:
In that neighborhood there were two villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's
shop, nor barber, which the other that was close to it had; so the barber of the larger served
the smaller; and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and another man who wanted
to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but
as luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which
probably was a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered at half
a league's distance. He rode upon a gray ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem
to Don Quixote to be a dapple-gray steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for everything he
saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and ill errant notions; and when he saw the
poor knight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed
he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him through and through,
and as he reached him, without checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him, "Defend thyself,
miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that which is so reasonably my due."

The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down
upon him, had no other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let himself
fall off his ass; and no sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than
a deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.

He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented himself, saying that the
pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the beaver, which finding himself pressed by the
hunters bites and cuts off with its teeth that for which by its natural instinct, it knows
it is pursued.

He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he, taking it in his hands, said, "By God the basin
is a good one, and worth a piece of eight[445-3] if it is worth a maravedi," and handed it
to his master, who immediately put it on his head, turning it round, now this way, now that,
in search of the visor. Not finding it he said, "Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous
headpiece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worst of it is half of
it is wanting."

When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to restrain his laughter, but
remembering his master's wrath he checked himself in the midst of it.

"What art thou laughing at, Sancho?" said Don Quixote.

"I am laughing," said he, "to think of the great head the pagan must have had who owned this
helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber's basin."

"Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?" said Don Quixote; "that this wonderful piece of this
enchanted helmet must by some strange accident have come into the hands of some one who was
unable to recognize or realize its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to
be of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what it might be worth,
and of the other made this which is like a barber's basin, as thou sayest; but be it as it
may, to me who recognize it, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights
at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that that helmet the god
of smithies[446-4] forged for the god of battles shall not surpass it or even come up to it;
and in the meantime I will wear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing;
all the more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone."

"Will your worship," said Sancho, "tell me what are we to do with this dapple-gray steed that
looks like a gray ass, which that Martino[446-5] that your worship overthrew has left deserted
here? for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely ever to come back
for it; and by my beard but the gray is a good one."

When Don Quixote called Sancho to bring his helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds
agreed to sell him, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what to
do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he had already paid for them,
he thought it best to throw them into his master's helmet, and acting on this bright idea he
went to see what his master wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed to him, "Give
me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of adventures, or what I observe yonder
is one that will, and does, call upon me to arm myself."

He of the green gaban,[448-1] hearing this, looked in all directions, but could perceive nothing
except a cart coming towards them with two or three small flags, which led him to conclude
it must be carrying treasure of the King's, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however, would
not believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened to him must be
adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to the gentleman, "He who is prepared has
his battle half fought; nothing is lost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that
I have enemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when or where, or at what moment, or
in what shapes they will attack me;" and turning to Sancho he called for his helmet; and Sancho,
as he had no time to take out the curds, had to give it as it was.

Don Quixote took it, and without perceiving what was in it, thrust it down in hot haste upon
his head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all over his face
and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out to Sancho, "Sancho, what's this? I
think my head is softening, or my brains are melting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If
I am sweating it is not indeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure
which is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something to wipe myself with, if thou
hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding me."

Sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God at the same time that
his master had not found out what was the matter. Don Quixote then wiped himself, and took
off his helmet to see what it was that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white
mash inside his helmet, he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelled it he exclaimed,
"By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou has put here, thou treacherous,
impudent, ill-mannered squire!"

To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied, "If they are curds
let me have them, your worship, and I'll eat them; but let the devil eat them, for it must
have been he who put them there. I dare to dirty your worship's helmet! You have guessed the
offender finely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have enchanters too,
that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship, and they must have put that nastiness
there in order to provoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are wont
to do. Well, this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I trust to my master's good
sense to see that I have got no curds or milk, or anything of the sort; and that if I had,
it is in my stomach I would put it and not in the helmet."

"May be so," said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman was observing, and with astonishment,
more especially when, after having wiped himself clean, his head, face, beard, and helmet,
Don Quixote put it on, and settling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the
scabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, "Now come who will, here am I, ready to try conclusions
with Satan himself in person!"

By this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by any one except the carter on
a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixote planted himself before it and said, "Whither
are you going, brothers? What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?"

To this the carter replied, "The cart is mine; what is in it is a pair of fine caged lions,
which the governor of Oran is sending to court as a present to his Majesty; and the flags are
our lord the King's, to show that what is here is his property."

"And are the lions large?" asked Don Quixote.
