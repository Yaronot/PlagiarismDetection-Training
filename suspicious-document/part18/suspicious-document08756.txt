The stage can be amusing, but can it show life as it is without the aid of idealizing literary
art? And if the stage goes on in this materialistic way, how long will it be before it ceases
to amuse intelligent, not to say intellectual people?

THE LIFE-SAVING AND LIFE PROLONGING ART

In the minds of the public there is a mystery about the practice of medicine. It deals more
or less with the unknown, with the occult, it appeals to the imagination. Doubtless confidence
in its practitioners is still somewhat due to the belief that they are familiar with the secret
processes of nature, if they are not in actual alliance with the supernatural. Investigation
of the ground of the popular faith in the doctor would lead us into metaphysics. And yet our
physical condition has much to do with this faith. It is apt to be weak when one is in perfect
health; but when one is sick it grows strong. Saint and sinner both warm up to the doctor when
the judgment Day heaves in view.

In the popular apprehension the doctor is still the Medicine Man. We smile when we hear about
his antics in barbarous tribes; he dresses fantastically, he puts horns on his head, he draws
circles on the ground, he dances about the patient, shaking his rattle and uttering incantations.
There is nothing to laugh at. He is making an appeal to the imagination. And sometimes he cures,
and sometimes he kills; in either case he gets his fee. What right have we to laugh? We live
in an enlightened age, and yet a great proportion of the people, perhaps not a majority, still
believe in incantations, have faith in ignorant practitioners who advertise a "natural gift,"
or a secret process or remedy, and prefer the charlatan who is exactly on the level of the
Indian Medicine Man, to the regular practitioner, and to the scientific student of mind and
body and of the properties of the materia medica. Why, even here in Connecticut, it is impossible
to get a law to protect the community from the imposition of knavish or ignorant quacks, and
to require of a man some evidence of capacity and training and skill, before he is let loose
to experiment upon suffering humanity. Polpette à louisiana. Panettone are an bar of the municipality

 The Signora read the service, the household
responding--a twenty minutes' service, which is as much a part of the administration of the
establishment as visiting the granaries and presses, and the bringing home of the goats. The
Signora's apartments, which she permitted us to see, were quite in the nature of an oratory,
with shrines and sacred pictures and relics of the faith. By the shrine at the head of her
bed hung the rosary carried by Father Junipero,--a priceless possession. From her presses and
armoires, the Signora, seeing we had a taste for such things, brought out the feminine treasures
of three generations, the silk and embroidered dresses of last century, the ribosas, the jewelry,
the brilliant stuffs of China and Mexico, each article with a memory and a flavor.

But I must not be betrayed into writing about Ramona's house. How charming indeed it was the
next morning,--though the birds in the garden were astir a little too early,--with the thermometer
set to the exact degree of warmth without languor, the sky blue, the wind soft, the air scented
with orange and jessamine. The Signora had already visited all her premises before we were
up. We had seen the evening before an enclosure near the house full of cashmere goats and kids,
whose antics were sufficiently amusing--most of them had now gone afield; workmen were coming
for their orders, plowing was going on in the barley fields, traders were driving to the plantation
store, the fierce eagle in a big cage by the olive press was raging at his detention. Within
the house enclosure are an olive mill and press, a wine-press and a great storehouse of wine,
containing now little but empty casks,--a dusky, interesting place, with pomegranates and dried
bunches of grapes and oranges and pieces of jerked meat hanging from the rafters. The line there
is strongly of the put at present, and likewise on course in screams put of the commands in frolic
handmaidens of genius.

suspicious. If it is too good, too pronouncedly good, I fear I shall not like it so well on
a second reading. If it comes to stand between me and the thought, or the personality behind
the thought, I grow more and more suspicious. Is the book a window, through which I am to see
