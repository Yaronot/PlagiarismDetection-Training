then exclaimed, "How and when was this known?"

Richard went over the facts, giving as few names as possible, while his son stood looking down
and drawing lines with the point of his sword.

"I hoped," ended the father, "that these five years' absence might have made thee forget thy
childish inclination;" and as Humfrey, without raising his face, emphatically shook his head,
he went on to add-- "So, my dear son, meseemeth that there is no remedy, but that, for her
peace and thine own, thou shouldest accept this offer of brave Norreys, and by the time the
campaign is ended, they may be both safe in Scotland, out of reach of vexing thy heart, my
poor boy."

"Is it so sure that her royal lineage will be owned?" muttered Humfrey. "Out on me for saying
so!  But sure this lady hath made light enough of her wedlock with yonder villain."

"Even so, but that was when she deemed its offspring safe beneath the waves.  I fear me that,
however our poor damsel be regarded, she will be treated as a mere bait and tool.  If not bestowed
on some foreign prince (and there hath been talk of dukes and archdukes), she may serve to
tickle the pride of some Scottish thief, such as was her father."

other, she rode down the long avenue on her way to Wingfield.

The Bridgefield family had already made their arrangements, and their horses were waiting for
them amid the jubilations of Diccon and Ned. The Queen had given each of them a fair jewel,
with special thanks to them for being good brothers to her dear Cis.  "As if one wanted thanks
for being good to one's own sister," said Ned, thrusting the delicate little ruby brooch on
his mother to be taken care of till his days of foppery should set in, and he would need it
for cap and plume.

"Come, Cis, we are going home at last," said Diccon.  "What! thou art not breaking thine heart
over yonder Scottish lady--when we are going home, home, I say, and have got rid of watch and
ward for ever? Hurrah!" and he threw up his cap, and was joined in the shout by more than one
of the youngsters around, for Richard and most of the elders were escorting the Queen out of
the park, and Mistress Susan had been summoned on some question of household stuff. Frantz stood for
some minutes absorbed in that sexton; at chamber he said-- "were they baptized? I have more art

Whereupon Humfrey had the opportunity of venting a little of his vexation by thrashing his

at sea, and thereby nearly got another castigation for irreverent mocking of his elder brother's
