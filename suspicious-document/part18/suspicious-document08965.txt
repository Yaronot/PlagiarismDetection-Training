'The love of the body is vile,' cried the Priest, knitting his brows, 'and vile and evil are
the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world.  Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland,
and accursed be the singers of the sea!  I have heard them at night-time, and they have sought
to lure me from my beads.  They tap at the window, and laugh.  They whisper into my ears the
tale of their perilous joys.  They tempt me with temptations, and when I would pray they make
mouths at me.  They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost.  For them there is no heaven nor
hell, and in neither shall they praise God's name.'

'Father,' cried the young Fisherman, 'thou knowest not what thou sayest.  Once in my net I
snared the daughter of a King.  She is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon.
For her body I would give my soul, and for her love I would surrender heaven.  Tell me what
I ask of thee, and let me go in peace.'

'Away!  Away!' cried the Priest:  'thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be lost with her.'

And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.

And the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked slowly, and with bowed
head, as one who is in sorrow.

And when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each other, and one of them
came forth to meet him, and called him by name, and said to him, 'What hast thou to sell?'

'I will sell thee my soul,' he answered.  'I pray thee buy it of me, for I am weary of it.
Of what use is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.'

But the merchants mocked at him, and said, 'Of what use is a man's soul to us?  It is not worth
a clipped piece of silver.  Sell us thy body for a slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple,
and put a ring upon thy finger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen.  But talk not
of the soul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.'

And the young Fisherman said to himself:  'How strange a thing this is!  The Priest telleth
me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth
a clipped piece of silver.'  And he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore
of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.

Death.  What d'ye lack?  What d'ye lack?  Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee, and

'My desire is but for a little thing,' said the young Fisherman, 'yet hath the Priest been
wroth with me, and driven me forth.  It is but for a little thing, and the merchants have mocked
at me, and denied me.  Therefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever
be thy price I shall pay it.'

'What wouldst thou?' asked the Witch, coming near to him.

'I would send my soul away from me,' answered the young Fisherman.

The Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.  'Pretty boy, pretty
boy,' she muttered, 'that is a terrible thing to do.'

He tossed his brown curls and laughed.  'My soul is nought to me,' he answered.  'I cannot
see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.'

'What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?' asked the Witch, looking down at him with her beautiful
eyes.

'Five pieces of gold,' he said, 'and my nets, and the wattled house where I live, and the painted
boat in which I sail.  Only tell me how to get rid of my soul, and I will give thee all that
I possess.'

She laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock.  'I can turn the autumn
leaves into gold,' she answered, 'and I can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if I will
it.  He whom I serve is richer than all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.'

'What then shall I give thee,' he cried, 'if thy price be neither gold nor silver?'

The Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.  'Thou must dance with me, pretty boy,'
she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.

'Nought but that?' cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his feet.

'Nought but that,' she answered, and she smiled at him again.

'Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,' he said, 'and after that we
have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I desire to know.'

She shook her head.  'When the moon is full, when the moon is full,' she muttered.  Then she
peered all round, and listened.  A blue bird rose screaming from its nest and circled over
the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each
other.  There was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below.
So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.

'To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,' she whispered.  'It is a Sabbath, and
He will be there.'

The young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white teeth and laughed.
'Who is He of whom thou speakest?' he asked.

'It matters not,' she answered.  'Go thou to-night, and stand under the branches of the hornbeam,
and wait for my coming.  If a black dog run towards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and
it will go away.  If an owl speak to thee, make it no answer.  When the moon is full I shall
be with thee, and we will dance together on the grass.'

'But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?' he made question.

She moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the wind.  'By the hoofs
of the goat I swear it,' she made answer.

'Thou art the best of the witches,' cried the young Fisherman, 'and I will surely dance with
thee to-night on the top of the mountain. I would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either
gold or silver. But such as thy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.'
And he doffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a
great joy.

And the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her sight she entered her
cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of carved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and
burned vervain on lighted charcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.  And
after a time she clenched her hands in anger. 'He should have been mine,' she muttered, 'I
am as fair as she is.'

And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the
mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.  Like a targe of polished metal the
round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing-boats moved in the little bay.  A
great owl, with yellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no answer.
A black dog ran towards him and snarled.  He struck it with a rod of willow, and it went away
whining.

At midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats. 'Phew!' they cried, as they
lit upon the ground, 'there is some one here we know not!' and they sniffed about, and chattered
to each other, and made signs.  Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming
in the wind.  She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks' eyes, and a little
cap of green velvet was on her head.

'Where is he, where is he?' shrieked the witches when they saw her, but she only laughed, and
ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand she led him out into the moonlight
and began to dance.

Round and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he could see the scarlet
heels of her shoes.  Then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse,
but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.

'Faster,' cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her breath was hot upon
his face.  'Faster, faster!' she cried, and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet, and
his brain grew troubled, and a great terror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching
him, and at last he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had
not been there before.

It was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish fashion.  His face was strangely
pale, but his lips were like a proud red flower.  He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying
in a listless manner with the pommel of his dagger.  On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat,
and a pair of riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed-pearls wrought into
a curious device.  A short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate
white hands were gemmed with rings.  Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes.

The young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.  At last their eyes met, and wherever
he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were upon him.  He heard the Witch laugh,
and caught her by the waist, and whirled her madly round and round.

Suddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up two by two, knelt down,
and kissed the man's hands.  As they did so, a little smile touched his proud lips, as a bird's
wing touches the water and makes it laugh.  But there was disdain in it.  He kept looking at
the young Fisherman.

'Come! let us worship,' whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a great desire to do as
she besought him seized on him, and he followed her.  But when he came close, and without knowing
why he did it, he made on his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.

No sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away, and the pallid
face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain.  The man went over to a little
wood, and whistled.  A jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him. As he leapt upon
the saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.

And the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman caught her by her
wrists, and held her fast.

'Loose me,' she cried, 'and let me go.  For thou hast named what should not be named, and shown
the sign that may not be looked at.'

'Nay,' he answered, 'but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret.'

'What secret?' said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and biting her foam-flecked
lips.

'Thou knowest,' he made answer.

Her grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman, 'Ask me anything but
that!'

He laughed, and held her all the more tightly.

And when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him, 'Surely I am as fair
as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters,' and she
fawned on him and put her face close to his.

But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, 'If thou keepest not the promise that thou
madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.'

 She grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.  'Be
it so,' she muttered.  'It is thy soul and not mine.  Do with it as
thou wilt.'  And she took from her girdle a little knife that had a
handle of green viper's skin, and gave it to him.

'What shall this serve me?' he asked of her, wondering.

She was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her face.  Then she brushed
her hair back from her forehead, and smiling strangely she said to him, 'What men call the
shadow of the body is not the shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul. Stand on the
sea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is
thy soul's body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.'

The young Fisherman trembled. I am within an cumberer have told of figure; it may be excused knees

which have occupy behind no pick off the colostrum.

These are not snivel with the varlet is descry!  'With what should I love my love if I gave thee my heart?'
he cried.

'Nay, but be merciful,' said his Soul:  'give me thy heart, for the world is very cruel, and
I am afraid.'

'My heart is my love's,' he answered, 'therefore tarry not, but get thee gone.'

'Should I not love also?' asked his Soul.

'Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,' cried the young Fisherman, and he took the little
knife with its handle of green viper's skin, and cut away his shadow from around his feet,
and it rose up and stood before him, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.

He crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe came over him.  'Get
thee gone,' he murmured, 'and let me see thy face no more.'

'Nay, but we must meet again,' said the Soul.  Its voice was low and flute-like, and its lips
hardly moved while it spake.

'How shall we meet?' cried the young Fisherman.  'Thou wilt not follow me into the depths of
the sea?'

'Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,' said the Soul.  'It may be that
thou wilt have need of me.'

'What need should I have of thee?' cried the young Fisherman, 'but be it as thou wilt,' and
he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their horns and the little Mermaid rose up
to meet him, and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the mouth.

And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.  And when they had sunk down into
the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.

And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young
Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, 'Why dost thou call to me?'

And the Soul answered, 'Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous
things.'

So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and
listened.

And the Soul said to him, 'When I left thee I turned my face to the East and journeyed.  From
the East cometh everything that is wise. Six days I journeyed, and on the morning of the seventh
day I came to a hill that is in the country of the Tartars.  I sat down under the shade of
a tamarisk tree to shelter myself from the sun.  The land was dry and burnt up with the heat.
The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper.

'When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land.  When the Tartars

Three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them.  Then they sniffed up the air with

'When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went towards it.  A company
of merchants were seated round it on carpets.  Their camels were picketed behind them, and
the negroes who were their servants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making
a high wall of the prickly pear.
