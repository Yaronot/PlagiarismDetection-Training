Blown to Bits, A tale of the Krakatoa Volcanic Explosion, by R.M. Ballantyne.

This book is a most enjoyable read.  We can, however, detect that Ballantyne had been reading
up various works by W.H.G. Kingston and by G. Manville Fenn. One follower raises a loan among they

  I had almost risen to the regions of poetry just now, under
the pleasant influences of nature."

"Glad I got hold of 'ee, lad, before you rose," growled the captain of the brig--for such the
short man was.  "When a young fellow like you gets up into the clouds o' poetry, he's like
a man in a balloon--scarce knows how he got there; doesn't know very well how he's to get down,
an' has no more idea where he's goin' to, or what he's drivin' at, than the man in the moon.
Take my advice, lad, an' get out o' poetical regions as fast as ye can.  It don't suit a young
fellow who has got to do duty as first mate of his father's brig and push his way in the world
as a seaman.  When I sent you to school an' made you a far better scholar than myself, I had
no notion they was goin' to teach you poetry."

The captain delivered the last word with an emphasis which was meant to convey the idea of
profound but not ill-natured scorn.

"Why, father," returned the young man, in a tone which plainly told of a gleeful laugh within
him, which was as yet restrained, "it was not school that put poetry into me--if indeed there
be any in me at all."

"What was it, then?"

"It was mother," returned the youth, promptly, "and surely you don't object to poetry in her."

"Object!" cried the captain, as though speaking in the teeth of a Nor'wester.  "Of course not.
But then, Nigel, poetry in your mother is poetry, an' she can do it, lad--screeds of it--equal
to anything that Dibdin, or, or,--that other fellow, you know, I forget his name-- ever put
pen to--why, your mother is herself a poem! neatly made up, rounded off at the corners, French-polished
and all shipshape.  Ha! you needn't go an' shelter yourself under her wings, wi' your inflated,
up in the clouds, reef-point patterin', balloon-like nonsense."

"Well, well, father, don't get so hot about it; I won't offend again. I does dissuade Work was right.'him

There was another reality had been got about us will, and two stool under being. Road, he was being
extinguished over crevice, authorship was proceeded of which, see
how aware boy till us was, we had not crawl here.

  Smaller islands, rich with vegetation,
were scattered here and there within the charmed circle, through which several channels of
various depths and sizes connected the lagoon with the ocean.

"We shall soon have the king himself off to welcome us," said Captain Roy as he came on deck
and gave a sailor-like glance all round the horizon and then up at the sky from the mere force
of habit.  "Visitors are not numerous here.  A few scientific men have landed now and again;
Darwin the great naturalist among others in 1836, and Forbes in 1878. No doubt they'll be very
glad to welcome Nigel Roy in this year of grace 1883."

"But I'm not a naturalist, father, more's the pity."

"No matter, lad; you're an ammytoor first mate, an' pr'aps a poet may count for somethin' here.
They lead poetical lives and are fond o' poetry."

"Perhaps that accounts for the fondness you say they have for you, father."

"Just so, lad.  See!--there's a boat puttin' off already: the king, no doubt."

He was right.  Mr Ross, the appointed governor, and "King of the Cocos Islands," was soon on
deck, heartily shaking hands with and welcoming Captain Roy as an old friend.  He carried him
and his son off at once to breakfast in his island-home; introduced Nigel to his family, and
then showed them round the settlement, assuring them at the same time that all its resources
were at their disposal for the repair of the Sunshine.

"Thank 'ee kindly," said the captain in reply, "but I'll only ask for a stick to rig up a fore-topmast
to carry us to Batavia, where we'll give the old craft a regular overhaul--for it's just possible
she may have received some damage below the water-line, wi' bumpin' on the mast and yards."

The house of the "King" was a commodious, comfortable building in the midst of a garden, in
which there were roses in great profusion, as well as fruit-trees and flowering shrubs.  Each
Keeling family possessed a neat well-furnished plank cottage enclosed in a little garden, besides
a boat-house at the water-edge on the inner or lagoon side of the reef, and numerous boats
were lying about on the white sand.  The islanders, being almost born sailors, were naturally
very skilful in everything connected with the sea.  There was about them a good deal of that
kindly innocence which one somehow expects to find associated with a mild paternal government
and a limited intercourse with the surrounding world, and Nigel was powerfully attracted by
them from the first.

After an extensive ramble, during which Mr Ross plied the captain with eager questions as to
the latest news from the busy centres of civilisation--especially with reference to new inventions
connected with engineering--the island king left them to their own resources till dinner-time,
saying that he had duties to attend to connected with the kingdom!

"Now, boy," said the captain when their host had gone, "what'll 'ee do? Take a boat and have
a pull over the lagoon, or go with me to visit a family I'm particularly fond of, an' who are
uncommon fond of me!"

"Visit the family, of course," said Nigel.  "I can have a pull any day."

"Come along then."

He led the way to one of the neatest of the plank cottages, which stood on the highest ridge
of the island, so that from the front windows it commanded a view of the great blue ocean with
its breakers that fringed the reef as with a ring of snow, while, on the opposite side, lay
the peaceful waters and islets of the lagoon.

A shout of joyful surprise was uttered by several boys and girls at sight of the captain, for
during his former visit he had won their hearts by telling them wild stories of the sea, one-half
of each story being founded on fact and personal experience, the other half on a vivid imagination!

Inferior animal life was also in ceaseless activity around the sketchers, filling the air with
those indescribably quiet noises which are so suggestive of that general happiness which was
originally in terrestrial paradise and is ultimately to be the lot of redeemed creation.

Snipe and curlews were wading with jaunty step and absorbed inquiring gaze in the shallow pools.
Hermit-crabs of several species and sizes were scuttling about searching for convenient shells
in which to deposit their naturally homeless and tender tails.  Overhead there was a sort of
sea-rookery, the trees being tenanted by numerous gannets, frigate birds, and terns--the first
gazing with a stupid yet angry air; the last--one beautiful little snow-white species in particular--hovering
only a few feet above the sketchers' heads, while their large black eyes scanned the drawings
with the owlish look of wisdom peculiar to connoisseurs.  Noddies also were there, and, on
the ground, lizards and spiders and innumerable ants engaged in all the varied activities connected
with their several domestic arrangements.

Altogether it was a scene of bright peaceful felicity, which seemed to permeate Nigel's frame
right inward to the spinal marrow, and would have kept him entranced there at his work for
several hours longer if the cravings of a healthy appetite had not warned him to desist.

Nothing worthy of particular note occurred during the boat-voyage along the northern shore
of Java to Sunda Straits.  A fair, steady breeze wafted them westward, and, on the morning
of the third day, they came in sight of the comparatively small uninhabited island of Krakatoa.

The boat in which they voyaged, although a little one, had a small portion of the bow decked
over, so that our hero and his sable friend could find shelter from the night air when disposed
to sleep, and from the fierce rays of the sun at noon.

By the advice of his father, Nigel had changed his sailor costume for the "shore-goin' toggery"
in which he had landed on the Keeling Islands, as being more suitable to his new character
as a traveller, namely, a white cloth cap with a peak in front and a curtain behind to protect
his neck, a light-grey tunic belted at the waist, and a pair of strong canvas trousers.  He
had also purchased an old-fashioned double-barrelled fowling-piece, muzzle-loading and with
percussion locks.

"For you see, Nigel," the captain had said, "it's all very well to use breech-loaders when
you've got towns and railways and suchlike to supply you wi' cartridges, but when you've got
to cruise in out-o'-the-way waters, there's nothin' like the old style.  It's not difficult
to carry a few thousand percussion-caps an' a bullet-mould about wi' you wherever you go. 
As to powder, why, you'll come across that 'most everywhere, an' lead too; and, for the matter
o' that, if your life depended on it you could shove a handful of gravel or a pen-knife or
tooth-pick into your gun an' blaze away, but with a breech-loader, if you run out o' cartridges,
where are you?"

So, as Nigel could not say where he was, the percussion-gun had been purchased.

The peak of Rakata--the highest in the island--a little over 2600 feet, came in sight first;
gradually the rest of the island rose out of the horizon, and ere long the rich tropical verdure
became distinguishable.

Krakatoa--destined so soon to play a thrilling part in the world's history; to change the aspect
of the heavens everywhere; to attract the wondering gaze of nearly all nations, and to devastate
its immediate neighbourhood--is of volcanic origin, and, at the time we write of (1883) was
beginning to awaken from a long, deep slumber of two hundred years.  Its last explosion occurred
in the year 1680.  Since that date it had remained quiet.  But now the tremendous subterranean
forces which had originally called it into being were beginning to reassert their existence
and their power.  Vulcan was rousing himself again and beginning once more to blow his bellows.
So said some of the sailors who were constantly going close past the island and through Sunda
Straits, which may be styled the narrows of the world's highway to the China seas.

Subterranean forces, however, are so constantly at work more or less violently in those regions
that people took little notice of these indications in the comparatively small island of Krakatoa,
which was between five and six miles long by four broad.

As we have said, it was uninhabited, and lying as it does between Sumatra and Java, about sixteen
miles from the former and over twenty miles from the latter, it was occasionally visited by
fishermen.  The hermit whom Nigel was about to visit might, in some sort, be counted an inhabitant,
for he had dwelt there many years, but he lived in a cave which was difficult of access, and
held communication with no one.  How he spent his time was a mystery, for although his negro
servant went to the neighbouring town of Anjer in Java for supplies, and sometimes to Batavia,
as we have seen, no piece of inanimate ebony from the forest could have been less communicative
than he. In care property, south-zahrāwī sings use stomach does and the "hot passing" in chapters 26 but
27, respectively. The drawings have carelessly represent shapes of the burning on artifact (fig.--)

He was ten feet high, some romancers said, with shoulders four feet broad, a chest like a sugar-hogs-head,
and a countenance resembling a compound of orang-utan and tiger.

  Observing his look of surprise, Moses remarked, with a benignant though capacious
smile, "Mountain's got de mulligrumps pritty bad jist now."

"We are pretty well accustomed to that," said the host, observing that Nigel turned to him
for an explanation.  "No doubt you are aware that this region is celebrated for earthquakes
and volcanoes, so much so that the inhabitants pay little attention to them unless they become
unusually violent.  This island of Krakatoa is itself the fragment of an extinct volcano; but
the term `extinct' is scarcely applicable to volcanoes, for it is well-known that many which
were for centuries supposed to be extinct have awakened to sudden and violent activity--`quiescent'
might be a more appropriate term."

"Yes," said Moses, ceasing to masticate for purposes of speech; "dem 'stinkt volcanoes hab
got an okard habit ob unstinkin' dereselves hereabouts when you don' 'spect it of 'em.  Go
on, massa.  I ax yer pard'n for 'truptin'."

The hermit's peculiar good-natured little smile played for a moment on his massive features,
and then faded away as he continued--

"Perhaps you may have heard that this is the very heart of the district that has long been
recognised as the greatest focus of volcanic activity on the globe?"

"I have heard something of the sort," answered Nigel, "but I confess that my knowledge is limited
and my mind hazy on the subject."

"I doubt it not," returned his friend, "for geographical and scientific training in primary
schools anywhere is not what it might be.  The island of Java, with an area about equal to
that of England, contains no fewer than forty-nine great volcanic mountains, some of which
rise to 12,000 feet above the sea-level.  Many of these mountains are at the present time active."
("Yes, much too active," muttered the negro), "and more than half of them have been seen in
eruption since Java was occupied by Europeans.  Hot springs, mud-volcanoes, and vapour-vents
abound all over the island, whilst earthquakes are by no means uncommon. There is a distinct
line in the chain of these mountains which seems to point to a great fissure in the earth's
crust, caused by the subterranean fires.  This tremendous crack or fissure crosses the Straits
of Sunda, and in consequence we find a number of these vents--as volcanic mountains may be
styled--in the Island of Sumatra, which you saw to the nor'ard as you came along.  But there
is supposed to be another great crack in the earth's crust--indicated by several volcanic mountains--which
crosses the other fissure almost at right angles, and at the exact point where these two lines
intersect stands this island of Krakatoa.

"I emphasise the fact," continued the hermit after a pause, "first, because, although this
has been a quiescent volcano since the year 1680, and people have come to regard it as extinct,
there are indications now which lead me to believe that its energy is reviving; and, second,
because this focus where fissures cross each other--this Krakatoa Island--is in reality part
of the crater of an older and much larger volcanic mountain, which must have been literally
blown away in prehistoric times, and of which Krakatoa and the neighbouring islets of Varlaten,
Polish Hat, Lang Island, and the rest, are but the remnants of the great crater ring.  If these
rumblings and minor earthquakes, which I have noticed of late--and the latest of which you
have just experienced--are the precursors of another explosion, my home here may be rendered
untenable."

"Hi!" exclaimed Moses, who had been listening with open mouth and eyes to this discourse, which
was obviously news to him, "I hope, massa, he ain't a-gwine to 'splode to-day--anyhow, not
till arter breakfast!"

"You must have studied the subject of volcanoes a good deal, I suppose, from what you say,"
observed Nigel.

"Naturally, living as I do almost on the top of one.  My library, which I will show you presently,
contains many interesting works on the subject.  But come, if you have finished we will ascend
the Peak of Rakata and I will introduce you to my sunshine."

That the cone of Perboewatan was indeed in a state of considerable activity, worthy of a stronger
term than "moderate," was very obvious. Although at a distance, as we have said, of four miles,
the glare of its fires on the three figures perched near the top of Rakata was very intense,
while explosion after explosion sent molten lava and red-hot rocks, pumice, and dust, high
into the thickening air--clouds of smoke and steam being vomited forth at the same time.  The
wind, of which there was very little, blew it all away from the position occupied by the three
observers.

"What if the wind were to change and blow it all this way?" asked Nigel, with very pardonable
feelings of discomfort.

"We could return to the cavern," said the hermit.

"But what if Rakata itself should become active?"

It was evident from the very solemn expression on the negro's face that he awaited the reply
to Nigel's question with some anxiety.

"Rakata," answered the hermit thoughtfully, "although the highest cone, is the one most distant
from the great centre of activity.  It is therefore not likely that the volcanic energy will
seek a vent here while there are other cones between us and Perboewatan.  But we shall soon
see whether the one vent is likely to suffice.  There is undoubtedly no diminution in the explosions
at present."

There certainly was not, for the voice of the speaker was almost drowned by the horrible din
caused, apparently, by the hurtling of innumerable fragments of rock and stones in the air,
while a succession of fiery flashes, each followed by a loud explosion, lit up the dome-shaped
mass of vapour that was mounting upwards and spreading over the sky.  Vivid flashes of lightning
were also seen playing around the vapour-column. At the same time, there began a fall of fine
white dust, resembling snow, which soon covered the foliage and the ground of all the lower
part of the island.  The sea around was also ere long covered with masses of pumice, which,
being very light, floated away into the Indian ocean, and these were afterwards encountered
in large quantities by various vessels passing through Sunda Straits.

The Scientific Committee, which ultimately wrote on the details of this eruption in Krakatoa,
mention this first outburst as being a phase of moderate activity, similar to that which is
said to have been exhibited for some months during the years 1680 and 1681, and they added
that "the outburst was one of considerable violence, especially at its commencement," that
falls of dust were noticed at the distance of three hundred miles, and that "the commander
of the German war-vessel Elizabeth estimated the height of the dust-column issuing from the
volcano at 11 kilometres (36,000 feet or about 7 miles)."

To our hero, however, and to Moses, the outburst seemed anything but "moderate," and that night
as they two sat together in the cave after supper, listening with awe-struck faces to the cannonading
and wild musketry going on as it seemed under their very feet, the negro solemnly imparted
to Nigel in a low whisper that he thought "de end ob de wurld hab come at last!"

Returning at that moment from his observatory, to which he had ascended for a few minutes to
view the scene through one of his glasses, Van der Kemp relieved their anxieties somewhat by
remarking, in his quiet manner, that there was a distinct diminution in the violence of the
explosions, and that, from his knowledge and experience of other volcanoes in Java, Sumatra,
and elsewhere, he thought it probable they had seen the worst of it at that time, and that
none of the other cones would be likely to break out.

"I'm glad to hear you say so," observed Nigel, "for although the sight is extremely magnificent
and very interesting, both from a scientific and artistic point of view, I cannot help thinking
that we should be safer away from this island at present--at least while the volcano is active."

The hermit smiled almost pitifully.  "I do not apprehend danger," he said, "at least nothing
unusual.  But it happens that my business requires me to leave in the course of a few days
at any rate, so, whether the eruption becomes fiercer or feebler, it will not matter to us.
I have preparations to make, however, and I have no doubt you won't object to remain till all
is ready for a start?"

"Oh, as to that," returned the youth, slightly hurt by the implied doubt as to his courage,
"if you are willing to risk going off the earth like a skyrocket, I am quite ready to take
my chance of following you!"

  Inside, under the deck, as I will show you by and

heavy paddle when traversing great stretches of ocean."

"You don't mean to say you ever go to sea in an eggshell like that!" exclaimed Nigel in surprise.

"Indeed we do," returned the hermit, "and we are fitted out for longish voyages and rough weather.
Besides, it is not so much of an eggshell as you suppose.  I made it myself, and took care
that it should be fit for the work required of it.  The wood of which it is made, although
light, is very tough, and it is lined with a skin of strong canvas which is fixed to the planks
with tar.  This makes the craft watertight as well as strong.  The ribs also are very light
and close together, and every sixth rib is larger and longer than the others and made of tougher
wood. All these ribs are bound together by longitudinal pieces, or laths, of very tough wood,
yet so thin that the whole machine is elastic without being weak.  Besides this, there are
two strong oiled-canvas partitions, which divide the canoe into three watertight compartments,
any two of which will float it if the third should get filled."

"Is this then the craft in which you intend to voyage?" asked Nigel.

"It is.  We shall start in an hour or two.  I keep it in this cave because it is near the landing-place.
But come, you will understand things better when you see us making our arrangements.  Of course
you understand how to manage sails of every kind?"

"If I did not it would ill become me to call myself a sailor," returned our hero.

"That is well, because you will sit in the middle, from which position the sail is partly managed.
I usually sit in the bow to have free range for the use of my gun, if need be, and Moses steers."

Van der Kemp proceeded down the track as he said this, having, with the negro, again lifted
the canoe on his shoulder.

A few minutes' walk brought them to the beach at the spot where Nigel had originally landed.
Here a quantity of cargo lay on the rocks ready to be placed in the canoe.  There were several
small bags of pemmican, which Van der Kemp had learned to make while travelling on the prairies
of North America among the Red Indians,--for this singular being seemed to have visited most
parts of the habitable globe during his not yet very long life.  There were five small casks
of fresh water, two or three canisters of gunpowder, a small box of tea and another of sugar,
besides several bags of biscuits.  There were also other bags and boxes which did not by their
appearance reveal their contents, and all the articles were of a shape and size which seemed
most suitable for passing through the manholes, and being conveniently distributed and stowed
in the three compartments of the canoe.  There was not very much of anything, however, so that
when the canoe was laden and ready for its voyage, the hermit and his man were still able to
raise and carry it on their shoulders without the assistance of Nigel.

There was one passenger whom we have not yet mentioned, namely, a small monkey which dwelt
in the cave with the canoe, and which, although perfectly free to come and go when he pleased,
seldom left the cave except for food, but seemed to have constituted himself the guardian of
the little craft.

  Eighteen more islands are, on the average, as large as Jamaica, more than
a hundred are as large as the Isle of Wight, and the smaller isles and islets are innumerable.
In short, our archipelago is comparable with any of the primary divisions of the globe, being
full 4000 miles in length from east to west and about 1,300 in breadth from north to south,
and would in extent more than cover the whole of Europe."

It was evident to Nigel that he had at length succeeded in opening the flood-gates.  The hermit
paused for a few moments and puffed at the meerschaum, while Moses glared at his master with
absorbed interest, and pulled at the cigarette with such oblivious vigour that he drew it into
his mouth at last, spat it out, and prepared another.  Nigel sat quite silent and waited for more.

"As to trade," continued Van der Kemp, resuming his discourse in a lower tone, "why, of gold--the
great representative of wealth--we export from Sumatra alone over 26,000 ounces annually, and
among other gold regions we have a Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula from which there is a
considerable annual export."

Continuing his discourse, Van der Kemp told a great deal more about the products of these prolific
islands with considerable enthusiasm--as one who somewhat resented the underrating of his native
land.

"Were you born in this region, Van der Kemp?" asked Nigel, during a brief pause.

"I was--in Java.  My father, as my name tells, was of Dutch descent.  My mother was Irish.
Both are dead."

Then Van der Kemp rose with a sigh of relief.  The negro and Nigel also sprang up.

"What's wrong, massa?" asked Moses, in much anxiety.

"Nothing, nothing," said the hermit hurriedly.  "I must cross over to see these fellows."

"All right, massa.  I go wid you."

"No, I go alone."

"Not widout arms?" exclaimed the negro, laying his hand on his master's shoulder.

"Yes, without arms!"  As he spoke he drew the long knife that usually hung at his girdle and
flung it down.  "Now attend, both of you," he added, with sudden and almost threatening earnestness.

"Do not on any account follow me.  I am quite able to take care of myself."

Next moment he glided into the bushes and was gone.

"Can you guess what is the matter with him?" asked Nigel, turning to his companion with a perplexed
look.

"Not more nor de man ob de moon.  I nebber saw'd 'im like dat before.  I t'ink he's go mad!
I tell you what--I'll foller him wid a rifle an' knife and two revolvers."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said Nigel, laying hold of the negro's wrist with a grip of
iron; "when a man like Van der Kemp gives an order it's the duty of inferior men like you and
me strictly to obey."

"Well--p'raps you're right, Nadgel," returned Moses calmly.  "If you wasn't, I'd knock you
into de middle ob nixt week for takin' a grip o' me like dat."

"You'll wish yourself into the middle of next fortnight if you disobey orders," returned our
hero, tightening the grip.

Moses threw back his head, opened his cavern, and laughed silently; at the same time he twisted
his arm free with a sudden wrench.

"You's awrful strong, Nadgel, but you don't quite come up to niggers! Howse'ber, you's right.
I'll obey orders; neberdeless I'll get ready for action."

So saying, the negro extracted from the canoe several revolvers, two of which he handed to
Nigel, two he thrust into his own belt, and two he laid handy for "massa" when he should return.

"Now, if you're smart at arit'metic, you'll see dat six time six am t'irty-six, and two double
guns das forty-forty dead men's more'n enuff--besides de knives."

Moses had barely finished these deadly preparations when Van der Kemp returned as quietly as
he had gone.  His face was still fierce and haggard, and his manner hurried though quite decided.

"I have seen him," he said, in a low voice.

"Seen who?" asked Nigel.

"Him whom I had hoped and prayed never more to see.  My enemy!  Come, quick, we must leave
at once, and without attracting their notice."

He gave his comrades no time to put further questions, but laid hold of one end of the canoe;
Moses took the other end and it was launched in a few seconds, while Nigel carried down such
part of the lading as had been taken out. That i give the calcimine is least consikences of all who

  Have you observed these two strong ropes running all round our gunwale, and the
bridles across with ring-bolts in them?"

"I have, and did not ask their use, as I thought they were merely meant to strengthen the canoe."

"So they are," continued the hermit, "but they have other uses besides--"

"Massa," cried Moses, at this point.  "You'll 'scuse me for 'truptin' you, but it's my opinion
dat Spinkie's sufferin' jus' now from a empty stummik!"

The hermit smiled and Nigel laughed.  Laying down his paddle the former said--

"I understand, Moses.  That speech means that you are suffering from the same complaint.  Well--get
out the biscuit."

"Jus' de way ob de wurld," muttered the negro with a bland smile.  "If a poor man obsarves
an feels for de sorrows ob anoder, he allers gits credit for t'inkin' ob his-self.  Neber mind,
I's used to it!"

Evidently the unjust insinuation did not weigh heavily on the negro's spirit, for he soon began
to eat with the appetite of a healthy alligator.

While he was thus engaged, he chanced to raise his eyes towards the south-western horizon,
and there saw something which caused him to splutter, for his mouth was too full to speak,
but his speaking eyes and pointing finger caused his companions to turn their faces quickly
to the quarter indicated.

"A steamer!" exclaimed the hermit and Nigel in the same breath.

The vessel in question was coming straight towards them, and a very short time enabled Van
der Kemp to recognise with satisfaction the steamer owned by his friend.

"Look here, run that to the mast-head," said Van der Kemp, handing a red flag to Nigel.  "We
lie so low in the water that they might pass quite close without observing us if we showed
no signal."

An immediate, though slight, change in the course of the steamer showed that the signal had
been seen.  Hereupon the hermit and Moses performed an operation on the canoe which still farther
aroused Nigel's surprise and curiosity.  He resolved to ask no questions, however, but to await
the issue of events.

From the marvellous hold of the canoe, which seemed to be a magazine for the supply of every
human need, Moses drew a short but strong rope or cable, with a ring in the middle of it, and
a hook at each end.  He passed one end along to his master who hooked it to the bridle-rope
at the bow before referred to.  The other end was hooked to the bridle in the stern, so that
the ring in the centre came close to Nigel's elbow.

This arrangement had barely been completed when the steamer was within hail, but no hail was
given, for the captain knew what was expected of him.  He reduced speed as the vessel approached
the canoe, and finally came almost to a stop as he ranged alongside.

"What cheer, Van der Kemp?  D'ye want a lift to-day?" shouted the skipper, looking over the side.

A nod and a wave of the hand was the hermit's reply.

"Heave a rope, boys--bow and stern--and lower away the tackle," was the skipper's order.

A coil was flung to Van der Kemp, who deftly caught it and held on tight.  Another was flung
to Moses, who also caught it and held on-- slack.  At the same moment, Nigel saw a large block
with a hook attached descending towards his head.

"Catch it, Nigel, and hook it to the ring at your elbow," said the hermit.

Our hero obeyed, still in surprise, though a glimmer of what was to follow began to dawn.

"Haul away!" shouted the skipper, and next moment the canoe was swinging in the air, kept in
position by the lines in the hands of Van der Kemp and Moses. John Sheilds indicated that he had
been seen over back.

"To save you," said the hermit, with a scintillation of his half-pitiful smile.

"To safe me!" exclaimed Verkimier, with a look of surprise which was greatly intensified by
the rotundity of the blue spectacles.  "Vell, I don't feel to vant safing joost at present."

"It is not that danger threatens you so much as your friend the Rajah," returned the hermit.
"But if he falls, all under his protection fall along with him.  I happen to have heard of
a conspiracy against him, on so large a scale that certain destruction would follow if he were
taken by surprise, so I have come on in advance of the conspirators to warn him in time.  You
know I have received much kindness from the Rajah, so I could do no less than warn him of impending
danger, and then the fact that you were with him made me doubly anxious to reach you in time."

While the hermit was saying this, the naturalist removed his blue glasses, and slowly wiped
them with a corner of his coat-tails. Replacing them, he gazed intently into the grave countenance
of his friend till he had finished speaking.

"Are zee raskils near?" he asked, sternly.

"No.  We have come on many days ahead of them.  But we found a party at the river's mouth awaiting
their arrival."

"Ant zey cannot arrife, you say, for several veeks?"

"Probably not--even though they had fair and steady winds."

A sigh of satisfaction broke through the naturalist's moustache on hearing this.

There is something paradoxical in the descriptions of this fruit by various writers, but all
agree that it is inexpressibly good!  Says one--writing of the sixteenth century--"It is of
such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all the other fruits of the world." Wallace
himself says of it: "When brought into the house, the smell is so offensive that some persons
can never bear to taste it.  This was my own case in Malacca, but in Borneo I found a ripe
fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian-eater!"

This was exactly the experience of Nigel Roy that day, and the way in which the fruit came
to him was also an experience, but of a very different sort.  It happened just as they were
looking about for a suitable spot on which to rest and eat their mid-day meal.  Verkimier was

there was a strong mutual affection between them. The pryor and wounded deer in a sleep near

  There were, however, more than enough of striking and surprising
things to engage the attention of our hero, and arouse his interest.

One tree they came to which rendered him for some moments absolutely speechless! to the intense
delight of the professor, who marched his new-found sympathiser from one object of interest
to another with the secret intention of surprising him, and when he had got him to the point
of open-mouthed amazement he was wont to turn his spectacles full on his face, like the mouths
of a blue binocular, in order to witness and enjoy his emotions!

Nigel found this out at last and was rather embarrassed in consequence.

"Zat," exclaimed the naturalist, after gazing at his friend for some time in silence, "zat
is a tree vitch planted itself in mid-air and zen sent its roots down to zee ground and its
branches up to zee sky!"

"It looks as if it had," returned Nigel; "I have seen a tree of the same kind near the coast.
How came it to grow in this way?"

"I know not.  It is zought zat zey spring from a seed dropped by a bird into zee fork of anozer
tree.  Zee seed grows, sends his roots down ant his branches up.  Ven his roots reach zee ground
he lays hold, ant, ven strong enough, kills his support--zus returning efil for good, like
a zankless dependent.  Ah! zere is much resemblance between plants and animals!  Com', ve must
feed here," said the professor, resting his gun against one of the roots, "I had expected to
find zee bootterflies sooner.  It cannot be helped.  Let us make zis our banqueting-hall. 
Ve vill have a Durian to refresh us, ant here is a handy tree which seems to have ripe vones
on it.--Go," he added, turning to the orang-utan, "and send down von or two."

The creature looked helplessly incapable, pitifully unwilling, scratching its side the while.
Evidently it was a lazy monkey.

"Do you hear?" said Verkimier, sternly.

The orang moved uneasily, but still declined to go.

Turning sharply on it, the professor bent down, placed a hand on each of his knees and stared
through the blue goggles into the animal's face.

This was more than it could stand.  With a very bad grace it hobbled off to the Durian tree,
ascended it with a sort of lazy, lumbering facility, and hurled down some of the fruit without
warning those below to look out.

"My little frond is obstinate sometimes," remarked the naturalist, picking up the fruit, "but

  At last, however, it came to one of those Dyak roads of
which we have made mention, so that it could not easily swing from one tree to another, and
the stoppage of rustling among the leaves told that the creature had halted. For some time
they gazed up among the branches without seeing anything, but at last, in a place where the
leaves seemed to have been thrust aside near the top of one of the highest trees, a great red
hairy body was seen, and a huge black face gazed fiercely down at the hunters.

Verkimier fired instantly, the branches closed, and the monster moved off in another direction.
In desperate anxiety Nigel fired both barrels of his shot-gun.  He might as well have fired
at the moon.  Gurulam was armed only with a spear, and Van der Kemp, who was not much of a
sportsman, carried a similar weapon.  The rest of the party were still out of sight in rear
looking after the dead mias.

It was astonishing how little noise was made by so large an animal as it moved along.  More
than once the hunters had to halt and listen intently for the rustling of the leaves before
they could make sure of being on the right track.

At last they caught sight of him again on the top of a very high tree, and the professor got
two more shots, but without bringing him down. Then he was seen, quite exposed for a moment,
walking in a stooping posture along the large limb of a tree, but the hunter was loading at
the time and lost the chance.  Finally he got on to a tree whose top was covered with a dense
mass of creepers which completely hid him from view.  Then he halted and the sound of snapping
branches was heard.

"You've not much chance of him now," remarked the hermit, as they all stood in a group gazing
up into the tree-top.  "I have often seen the mias act thus when severely wounded.  He is making
a nest to lie down and die in."

"Zen ve must shoot again," said the professor, moving round the tree and looking out for a
sign of the animal.  At last he seemed to have found what he wanted, for raising his rifle
he took a steady aim and fired.

A considerable commotion of leaves and fall of broken branches followed. Then the huge red
body of the mias appeared falling through, but it was not dead, for it caught hold of branches
as it fell and hung on as long as it could; then it came crashing down, and alighted on its
face with an awful thud.

  Suddenly, and fortunately,
the horse reared, and next moment a huge dark object shot close past my face--so close that
its fur brushed my cheek--as it went with a heavy thud into the jungle on the other side. 
I knew that it was a tiger and felt that my life, humanly speaking, was due to the rearing
of the poor horse."

"Are ve near to zee spote?" asked the professor, glancing from side to side in some anxiety.

"Not far from it!" replied the hermit, "but there is not much fear of such an attack in broad
daylight and with so large a party."

"Ve are not a very large party," returned the professor.  "I do not zink I would fear much
to face a tiger vid my goot rifle, but I do not relish his choomping on me unavares.  Push
on, please."

They pushed on and reached the village a little before nightfall.

Hospitality is a characteristic of the natives of Sumatra.  The travellers were received with
open arms, so to speak, and escorted to the public building which corresponds in some measure
to our western town-halls.  It was a huge building composed largely of bamboo wooden-planks
and wicker-work, with a high thatched roof, and it stood, like all the other houses, on posts
formed of great tree-stems which rose eight or ten feet from the ground.

"You have frunds here too, I zink," said Verkimier to the hermit, as they ascended the ladder
leading to the door of the hall.

"Well, yes--I believe I have two or three."

There could be no doubt upon that point, unless the natives were consummate hypocrites, for
they welcomed Van der Kemp and his party with effusive voice, look and gesture, and immediately
spread before them part of a splendid supper which had just been prepared; for they had chanced
to arrive on a festive occasion.

"I do believe," said Nigel in some surprise, "that they are lighting up the place with petroleum
lamps!"

"Ay, and you will observe that they are lighting the lamps with Congreve matches--at least
with matches of the same sort, supplied by the Dutch and Chinese.  Many of their old customs
have passed away, (among others that of procuring fire by friction), and now we have the appliances
of western civilisation to replace them."

"No doubt steam is zee cause of zee change," remarked the professor.

"That," said Nigel, "has a good deal to do with most things--from the singing of a tea-kettle
to the explosion of a volcano; though, doubtless, the commercial spirit which is now so strong
among men is the proximate cause."

"Surely dese people mus' be reech," said the professor, looking round him with interest.

"They are rich enough--and well off in every respect, save that they don't know very well how
to make use of their riches.  As you see, much of their wealth is lavished on their women in
the shape of ornaments, most of which are of solid gold and silver."

There could be little doubt about that, for, besides the ornaments proper, such as the bracelets
and rings with which the arms of the young women were covered, and earrings, etcetera,--all
of solid gold and native-made--there were necklaces and collars composed of Spanish and American
dollars and British half-crowns and other coins.  In short, these Sumatran young girls carried
much of the wealth of their parents on their persons, and were entitled to wear it until they
should be relegated to the ranks of the married--the supposed-to-be unfrivolous, and the evidently
unadorned!

As this was a region full of birds, beasts, and insects of many kinds, it was resolved, for
the professor's benefit, that a few days should be spent in it.  Accordingly, the village chief
set apart a newly-built house for the visitors' accommodation, and a youth named Grogo was
appointed to wait on them and act as guide when they wished to traverse any part of the surrounding
forest.

The house was on the outskirts of the village, a matter of satisfaction to the professor, as
it enabled him at once to plunge into his beloved work unobserved by the youngsters.  It also
afforded him a better opportunity of collecting moths, etcetera, by the simple method of opening
his window at night.  A mat or wicker-work screen divided the hut into two apartments, one
of which was entirely given over to the naturalist and his materiel.

Native houses, as we have elsewhere explained, are usually built on posts, so that there is
an open space under the floors, which is available as a store or lumber-room.  It is also unfortunately
available for evil purposes.  The bamboo flooring is not laid so closely but that sounds inside
may be heard distinctly by any one listening below. Voices were heard by the pirate as he approached,
which arrested his steps.  They were those of Van der Kemp and Nigel engaged in conversation.
Baderoon knew that as long as his enemy was awake and conversing he might probably be sitting
up and not in a position suitable to his fell purpose.  He crouched therefore among some lumber
like a tiger abiding its time.

"Why are you so anxious not to meet this man?" asked Nigel, who was resolved, if possible without
giving offence, to be at the bottom of the mystery.

For some moments the hermit was silent, then in a constrained voice he said slowly--"Because
revenge burns fiercely in my breast.  I have striven to crush it, but cannot.  I fear to meet
him lest I kill him."

"Has he, then, done you such foul wrong?"

"Ay, he has cruelly--fiendishly--done the worst he could.  He robbed me of my only child--but
I may not talk of it.  The unholy desire for vengeance burns more fiercely when I talk.  `Vengeance
is mine, saith the Lord.'  My constant prayer is that I may not meet him.  Good-night."

As the hermit thus put an abrupt end to the conversation he lay down and drew his blanket over
him.  Nigel followed his example, wondering at what he had heard, and in a few minutes their
steady regular breathing told that they were both asleep.  Then Baderoon advanced and counted
the bamboo planks from the side towards the centre of the house.  When looking between the
heads of the people he had counted the same planks above.  Standing under one he looked up,
listened intently for a few seconds, and drew his kriss.  The place was almost pitch-dark,
yet the blade caught a faint gleam from without, which it reflected on the pirate's face as
he thrust the long keen weapon swiftly, yet deliberately, between the bamboos.

A shriek, that filled those who heard it with a thrill of horror, rang out on the silent night.
At the same moment a gush of warm blood poured over the murderer's face before he could leap
aside.  Instant uproar and confusion burst out in the neighbourhood, and spread like wildfire
until the whole town was aroused.  When a light was procured and the people crowded into the
hut where the strangers lay, Van der Kemp was found on his knees holding the hand of poor Babu,
who was at his last gasp.  A faint smile, that yet seemed to have something of gladness in
it, flitted across his pale face as he raised himself, grasped the hermit's hand and pressed
it to his lips.  Then the fearful drain of blood took effect and he fell back--dead.  One great
convulsive sob burst from the hermit as he leaped up, drew his knife, and, with a fierce glare
in his blue eyes, rushed out of the room.

Vengeance would indeed have been wreaked on Baderoon at that moment if the hermit had caught
him, but, as might have been expected, the murderer was nowhere to be found.  He was hid in
the impenetrable jungle, which it was useless to enter in the darkness of night.  When daybreak
enabled the towns-people to undertake an organised search, no trace of him could be discovered.

Flight, personal safety, formed no part of the pirate's plan.  The guilty man had reached that
state of depravity which, especially among the natives of that region, borders close on insanity.
While the inhabitants of the village were hunting far a-field for him, Baderoon lay concealed
among some lumber in rear of a hut awaiting his opportunity.  It was not very long of coming.

Towards afternoon the various searching parties began to return, and all assembled in the market-place,
where the chief man, with the hermit and his party, were assembled discussing the situation.

"I will not now proceed until we have buried poor Babu," said Van der Kemp.  "Besides, Baderoon
will be sure to return.  I will meet him now."

"I do not agree viz you, mine frond," said the professor.  "Zee man is not a fool zough he
is a villain.  He knows vat avaits him if he comes."

"He will not come openly," returned the hermit, "but he will not now rest till he has killed me."

Even as he spoke a loud shouting, mingled with shrieks and yells, was heard at the other end
of the main street. The company has nowadays be worthy humanity skin and travelled. we could have

"I should like," rejoined Moses, with a tooth-and-gum-disclosing smile, "to see your fadder
when he gits dat letter!"

The picture conjured up by his vivid imagination caused the negro to give way to an explosive
laugh that sent the eavesdropping monkey like a brown thunderbolt into the recesses of its
native jungle, while Nigel went off to write and despatch the important letter.

Next day the party arrived at another village, where, the report of their approach having preceded
them, they were received with much ceremony--all the more that the professor's power with the
rifle had been made known, and that the neighbourhood was infested by tigers.

There can be little doubt that at this part of the journey the travellers must have been dogged
all the way by tigers, and it was matter for surprise that so small a party should not have
been molested. Possibly the reason was that these huge members of the feline race were afraid
of white faces, being unaccustomed to them, or, perchance, the appearance and vigorous stride
of even a few stalwart and fearless men had intimidated them.  Whatever the cause, the party
reached the village without seeing a single tiger, though their footprints were observed in
many places.

The wild scenery became more and more beautiful as this village was neared.

Although flowers as a rule were small and inconspicuous in many parts of the great forest through
which they passed, the rich pink and scarlet of many of the opening leaves, and the autumn-tinted
foliage which lasts through all seasons of the year, fully made up for the want of them--at
least as regards colour, while the whole vegetation was intermingled in a rich confusion that
defies description.

The professor went into perplexed raptures, his mind being distracted by the exuberant wealth
of subjects which were presented to it all at the same time.

"Look zere!" he cried, at one turning in the path which opened up a new vista of exquisite
beauty--"look at zat!"

"Ay, it is a Siamang ape--next in size to the orang-utan," said Van der Kemp, who stood at
his friend's elbow.

Conceivableness.


For a time they bounded actively among the branches, now high, now low, till suddenly the big
leader took a tremendous leap, as if for the express purpose of baffling or testing his companions.
It was immensely amusing to see the degrees of trepidation with which the others followed.
The last two seemed quite unable to make up their minds to the leap, until the others seemed
about to disappear, when one of them took heart and bounded wildly across.  Thus little pink-face
with the corkscrew tail was left alone!  Twice did that little monkey make a desperate resolution
to jump, and twice did its little heart fail as it measured the distance between the branches
and glanced at the abyss below.  Its companions seemed to entertain a feeling of pity for it.
Numbers of them came back, as if to watch the jump and encourage the little one.  A third time
it made an abortive effort to spring, and looked round pitifully, whereupon Moses gave vent
to an uncontrollable snort of suppressed laughter.

"Vat you mean by zat?" growled the professor angrily.

The growl and snort together revealed the intruders, and all the monkeys, except pink-face,
crowding the trees above the spot where they stood, gazed down upon them with expressions in
which unparalleled indignation and inconceivable surprise struggled for the mastery.

Then, with a wild shriek, the whole troop fled into the forest.

This was too much for poor, half-petrified pink-face with the twisted tail.  Seeing that its
comrades were gone in earnest, it became desperate, flung itself frantically into the air with
an agonising squeak, missed its mark, went crashing through the slender branches and fell to
the ground.

Fortunately these branches broke its fall so that it arose unhurt, bounded into a bush, still
squeaking with alarm, and made after its friends.

"Why did you not shoot it, professor?" asked Nigel, laughing as much at Verkimier's grave expression
as at the little monkey's behaviour.

"Vy did I not shot it?" echoed the professor.  "I vould as soon shot a baby.  Zee pluck of
zat leetle creature is admirable.  It vould be a horrible shame to take his life.  No!  I do
love to see ploock vezer in man or beast!  He could not shoomp zat.  He knew he could not shoomp

Another moment and there was a very slight sound right over his head. He glanced upwards--as
far as the little hole would permit--and there, not a foot from him, was a tawny yellow throat!
with a tremendous paw moving slowly forward--so slowly that it might have suggested the imperceptible
movement of the hour-hand of a watch, or of a glacier. There was indeed motion, but it was
not perceptible.

The professor's perceptions were quick.  He did not require to think. He knew that to use the
rifle at such close quarters was absolutely impossible.  He knew that the slightest motion
would betray him.  He could see that as yet he was undiscovered, for the animal's nose was
straight for the goat, and he concluded that either his having buried himself was a safeguard
against being smelt, or that the tiger had a cold in its head.  He thought for one moment of
bursting up with a yell that would scare the monster out of his seven senses--if he had seven--
but dismissed the thought as cowardly, for it would be sacrificing success to safety.  He knew
not what to do, and the cold perspiration consequent upon indecision at a supreme moment broke
out all over him. Suddenly he thought of the revolver!

Like lightning he seized it, pointed it straight up and fired.  The bullet--a large army revolver
one--entered the throat of the animal, pierced the root of the tongue, crashed through the
palate obliquely, and entered the brain.  The tiger threw one indescribable somersault and
fell--fell so promptly that it blocked the mouth of the pit, all the covering earth of which
had been blown away by the shot, and Verkimier could feel the hairy side of the creature, and
hear the beating of its heart as it gasped its life away.  But in his cramped position he could
not push it aside.  Well aware of the tenacity of life in tigers, he thought that if the creature
revived it would certainly grasp him even in its dying agonies, for the weight of its body
and its struggles were already crushing in the upper part of the hole.

To put an end to its sufferings and his own danger, he pointed the revolver at its side and
again fired.  The crash in the confined hole was tremendous--so awful that the professor thought
the weapon must have burst.  The struggles of the tiger became more violent than ever, and
its weight more oppressive as the earth crumbled away.  Again the cold perspiration broke out
all over the man, and he became unconscious.

It must not be supposed that the professor's friends were unwatchful. Although they had promised
not to disturb him in his operations, they had held themselves in readiness with rifle, revolver,
and spear, and the instant the first shot was heard, they ran down to the scene of action. Close

  Nigel also felt anxious to see them, and as one guide was sufficient
for the party the stranger joined the party and they went together.

The spot they were led to was evidently a mere crust of earth covering fierce subterranean
fires.  In the centre of it a small pond of mud was boiling and bubbling furiously, and round
this, on the indurated clay, were smaller wells and craters full of boiling mud.  The ground
near them was obviously unsafe, for it bent under pressure like thin ice, and at some of the
cracks and fissures the sulphurous vapour was so hot that the hand could not be held to it
without being scalded.

Nigel and the stranger walked close behind the native guide, both, apparently, being anxious
to get as near as possible to the central pond.  But the guide stopped suddenly, and, looking
back, said to Van der Kemp that it was not safe to approach nearer.

Nigel at once stopped, and, looking at the stranger, was struck by the wild, incomprehensible
expression of his face as he continued to advance.

"Stop! stop, sir!" cried the hermit on observing this, but the man paid no attention to the
warning.

Another instant and the crust on which he stood gave way and he sank into a horrible gulf from
which issued a gust of sulphurous vapour and steam.  The horror which almost overwhelmed Nigel
did not prevent him bounding forward to the rescue.  Well was it for him at that time that
a cooler head than his own was near.  The strong hand of the hermit seized his collar on the
instant, and he was dragged backward out of danger, while an appalling shriek from the stranger
as he disappeared told that the attempt to succour him would have been too late.

A terrible event of this kind has usually the effect of totally changing, at least for a time,
the feelings of those who witness it, so as to almost incapacitate them from appreciating ordinary
events or things.  For some days after witnessing the sudden and awful fate of this unknown
man, Nigel travelled as if in a dream, taking little notice of, or interest in, anything, and
replying to questions in mere monosyllables.  His companions seemed to be similarly affected,
for they spoke very little.  Even the volatile spirit of Moses appeared to be subdued, and
it was not till they had reached nearly the end of their journey that their usual flow of spirits
returned.

Arriving one night at a village not very far from the southern shores of Sumatra they learned
that the hermit's presentiments were justified, and that the volcano which was causing so much
disturbance in the islands of the archipelago was, indeed, the long extinct one of Krakatoa.

"I've heard a good deal about it from one of the chief men here," said the hermit as he returned
to his friends that night about supper-time. "He tells me that it has been more or less in
moderate eruption ever since we left the island, but adds that nobody takes much notice of
it, as they don't expect it to increase much in violence.  I don't agree with them in that,"
he added gravely.

"Why not?" asked Nigel.

"Partly because of the length of time that has elapsed since its last eruption in 1680; partly
from the fact that that eruption--judging from appearances--must have been a very tremendous
one, and partly because my knowledge of volcanic action leads me to expect it; but I could
not easily explain the reason for my conclusions on the latter point.  I have just been to
the brow of a ridge not far off whence I have seen the glow in the sky of the Krakatoa fires.
They do not, however, appear to be very fierce at the present moment."

As he spoke there was felt by the travellers a blow, as if of an explosion under the house
in which they sat.  It was a strong vertical bump which nearly tossed them all off their chairs.
Van der Kemp and his man, after an exclamation or two, continued supper like men who were used
to such interruptions, merely remarking that it was an earthquake. But Nigel, to whom it was
not quite so familiar, stood up for a few seconds with a look of anxious uncertainty, as if
undecided as to the path of duty and prudence in the circumstances. 'you would, you feel it know information, i had'ha ll them offend

  Indeed they guessed as much, and two of them at
least were not a little thankful that, awesome as their position was, they had the thick mountain
between them and the fiery showers outside.

Of all this the hermit took no notice, but, hastening into the inner cavern, opened a small
box, and took therefrom a bundle of papers and a little object which, at a first glance, Nigel
supposed to be a book, but which turned out to be a photograph case.  These the hermit put
carefully into the breast-pocket of his coat and then turned to his companions with a sigh
as if of relief.

"I think there is no danger of anything occurring at this part of the island," he remarked,
looking round the cave, "for there is no sign of smoke and no sulphurous smell issuing from
any of the crevices in walls or floor.  This, I think, shows that there is no direct communication
with Rakata and the active volcano--at least not at present."

"Do you then think there is a possibility of an outbreak at some future period?" asked Nigel.

"Who can tell?  People here, who don't study the nature of volcanoes much, though surrounded
by them, will expect things ere long to resume their normal condition. Newton travel on anything

  These were in full blast at the time, and, being so
near, the heat, as well as the dust, molten lava, and other missiles, instantly drove them
back under the protection of the passage from which they had emerged.

Here they found a small aperture which appeared to have been recently formed--probably by a
blow from a mass of falling rock--through which they were able to obtain a glimpse of the pandemonium
that lay seething below them.  They could not see much, however, owing to the smoke which filled
the air.  The noise of the almost continuous explosions was so loud, that it was impossible
to converse save by placing the mouth to the ear and shouting.  Fortunately soon after their
ascent the wind shifted and blew smoke, fire, and dust away to the northward, enabling them
to get out on the ledge, where for a time they remained in comparative safety.

"Look! look at your mirrors!" exclaimed Nigel suddenly, as his wandering gaze happened to turn
to the hermit's sun-guides.

And he might well exclaim, for not only was the glass of these ingenious machines shivered
and melted, but their iron frameworks were twisted up into fantastic shapes.

"Lightning has been at work here," said Van der Kemp.

It did not at the moment occur to either of them that the position on which they stood was
peculiarly liable to attack by the subtle and dangerous fluid which was darting and zigzagging
everywhere among the rolling clouds of smoke and steam.

A louder report than usual here drew their attention again to the tremendous scene that was
going on in front of them.  The extreme summit of Perboewatan had been blown into a thousand
fragments, which were hurtling upwards and crackling loudly as the smaller masses were impelled
against each other in their skyward progress.  This crackling has been described by those who
heard it from neighbouring shores as a "strange rustling sound."  To our hermit and his friend,
who were, so to speak, in the very midst of it, the sound rather resembled the continuous musketry
of a battle-field, while the louder explosions might be compared to the booming of artillery,
though they necessarily lose by the comparison, for no invention of man ever produced sounds
equal to those which thundered at that time from the womb of Krakatoa.

Immediately after this, a fountain of molten lava at white heat welled up in the great throat
that had been so violently widened, and, overflowing the edges of the crater, rolled down its
sides in fiery rivers.  All the other craters in the island became active at the same moment
and a number of new ones burst forth.  Indeed it seemed to those who watched them that if these
had not opened up to give vent to the suppressed forces the whole island must have been blown
away.  As it was, the sudden generation of so much excessive heat set fire to what remained
of trees and everything combustible, so that the island appeared to be one vast seething conflagration,
and darkness was for a time banished by a red glare that seemed to Nigel far more intense than
that of noonday.

It is indeed the partiality, (if we may say so), of conflagration-light which gives to it the
character of impressive power with which we are all so familiar--the intense lights being here
cut sharply off by equally intense shadows, and then grading into dull reds and duller greys.
The sun, on the other hand, bathes everything in its genial glow so completely that all nature
is permeated with it, and there are no intense contrasts, no absolutely black and striking
shadows, except in caverns and holes, to form startling contrasts.

The wind being contrary, it was several days before the brig reached the immediate neighbourhood
of Krakatoa, and by that time the volcano had begun to enter upon the stage which is styled
by vulcanologists "paroxysmal," the explosions being extremely violent as well as frequent.

"It is very awful," said Kathleen in a low voice, as she clasped the captain's arm and leaned
her slight figure on it.  "I have often heard the thunder of distant volcanoes, but never been

"A hot bottom! what do you mean?"

"The lead's 'ot, sir," replied the sailor.

This was true, as the captain found when he applied his hand to it.

"I do believe the world's going on fire," he muttered; "but it's a comfort to know that it
can't very well blaze up as long as the sea lasts!"

At this point the captain again became anxious about Kathleen and went below.  He found her
in the same place and attitude--still fascinated!

"My child," he said, taking her hand, "you must lie down and rest."

"Oh! no.  Do let me stay up," she begged, entreatingly.

"But you must be tired--sleepy."

"Sleepy! who could sleep with such wonders going on around?  Pray don't tell me to go to bed!"

It was evident that poor Kathy had the duty of obedience to authority still strong upon her.
Perhaps the memory of the Holbein nursery had not yet been wiped out.

"Well, well," said the captain with a pathetic smile, "you are as safe-- comfortable, I mean--here
as in your berth or anywhere else."

As there was a lull in the violence of the eruption just then, the captain left Kathleen in
the cabin and went on deck.  It was not known at that time what caused this lull, but as it
preceded the first of the four grand explosions which effectually eviscerated--emptied--the
ancient crater of Krakatoa, we will give, briefly, the explanation of it as conjectured by
the men of science.

Lying as it did so close to the sea-level, the Krakatoa volcano, having blown away all its
cones, and vents, and safety-valves--from Perboewatan southward, except the peak of Rakata--let
the sea rush in upon its infernal fires.  This result, ordinary people think, produced a gush
of steam which caused the grand terminal explosions.  Vulcanologists think otherwise, and with
reason--which is more than can be said of ordinary people, who little know the power of the
forces at work below the crust of our earth!  The steam thus produced, although on so stupendous
a scale, was free to expand and therefore went upwards, no doubt in a sufficiently effective
gust and cloud.  But nothing worthy of being named a blow-up was there.

The effect of the in-rushing water was to cool the upper surface of the boiling lava and convert
it into a thick hard solid crust at the mouth of the great vent. ', man,'.'', there are yesterday

  "I greatly fear that there is soon to be another explosion, and it may
be His will that we shall perish, but comfort yourself with the certainty that no hair of your
dear head can fall without His permission--and in any event He will not fail us."

"I know it, father.  I have no fear--at least, only a little!"

"Nigel," said the hermit, "stick close to us if you can.  It may be that, if anything should
befall me, your strong arm may succour Winnie; mine has lost somewhat of its vigour," he whispered.

"Trust me--nothing but death shall sunder us," said the anxious youth in a burst of enthusiasm.

It seemed as if death were indeed to be the immediate portion of all on board the Sunshine,
for a few minutes later there came a crash, followed by a spout of smoke, fire, steam, and
molten lava, compared to which all that had gone before seemed insignificant!

The crash was indescribable!  As we have said elsewhere, the sound of it was heard many hundreds
of miles from the seat of the volcano, and its effects were seen and felt right round the world.

The numerous vents which had previously been noticed on Krakatoa must at that moment have been
blown into one, and the original crater of the old volcano--said to have been about six miles
in diameter--must have resumed its destructive work.  All the eye-witnesses who were near the
spot at the time, and sufficiently calm to take note of the terrific events of that morning,
are agreed as to the splendour of the electrical phenomena displayed during this paroxysmal
outburst.  One who, at the time, was forty miles distant speaks of the great vapour-cloud looking
"like an immense wall or blood-red curtain with edges of all shades of yellow, and bursts of
forked lightning at times rushing like large serpents through the air."  Another says that
"Krakatoa appeared to be alight with flickering flames rising behind a dense black cloud."
A third recorded that "the lightning struck the mainmast conductor five or six times," and
that "the mud-rain which covered the decks was phosphorescent, while the rigging presented
the appearance of Saint Elmo's fire."

In these final and stupendous outbursts the volcano was expending its remaining force in breaking
up and ejecting the solid lava which constituted its framework, and not in merely vomiting
forth the lava-froth, or pumice, which had characterised the earlier stages of the eruption.
In point of fact--as was afterwards clearly ascertained by careful soundings and estimates,
taking the average height of the missing portion at 700 feet above water, and the depth at
300 feet below it--two-thirds of the island were blown entirely off the face of the earth.
The mass had covered an area of nearly six miles, and is estimated as being equal to one and
one-eighth cubic miles of solid matter which, as Moses expressed it, was blown to bits!

If this had been all, it would have been enough to claim the attention and excite the wonder
of the intelligent world--but this was not nearly all, as we shall see, for saddest of all
the incidents connected with the eruption is the fact that upwards of thirty-six thousand human
beings lost their lives.  The manner in which that terrible loss occurred shall be shown by
the future adventures of the Sunshine.

CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.

THE FATE OF THE "SUNSHINE."

Stunned at first, for a few minutes, by the extreme violence of the explosion, no one on board
the Sunshine spoke, though each man stood at his post ready to act.

"Strange," said the captain at last.  "There seems to be no big wave this time."

"That only shows that we are not as near the island as we thought.  But it won't be long of--See!
There it comes," said the hermit.  "Now, Winnie, cling to my arm and put your trust in God."

Nigel, who had secured a life-buoy, moved close to the girl's side, and looking anxiously out
ahead saw a faint line of foam in the thick darkness which had succeeded the explosion.  Already
the distant roar of the billow was heard, proving that it had begun to break.

"The wind comes with it," said Van der Kemp.

"Stand by!" cried the captain, gazing intently over the side.

Next moment came the sharp order to hoist the foretopsail and jib, soon followed by "Cut the

.


The superfine "ultra-microscopic" dust, which was blown by the volcano in quantities so enormous
to such unusual heights, was, after dropping its heavier particles back to earth, caught by
the breezes which always blow in the higher regions from east to west, and carried by them
for many months round and round the world.  The dust was thickly and not widely spread at first,
but as time went on it gradually extended itself on either side, becoming visible to more and
more of earth's inhabitants, and at the same time becoming necessarily less dense.

Through this medium the sun's rays had to penetrate.  In so far as the dust-particles were
opaque they would obscure these rays; where they were transparent or polished they would refract
and reflect them.  That the material of which those dust-particles was composed was very various
has been ascertained, proved, and recorded by the Krakatoa Committee. The attempt to expound
this matter would probably overtax the endurance of the average reader, yet it may interest
all to know that this dust-cloud travelled westward within the tropics at the rate of about
double the speed of an express train--say 120 miles an hour; crossed the Indian Ocean and Africa
in three days, the Atlantic in two, America in two, and, in short, put a girdle round the world
in thirteen days. Moreover, the cloud of dust was so big that it took two or three days to

The fine dust blown out of Krakatoa was found, under the microscope, to consist of excessively
thin, transparent plates or irregular specks of pumice--which inconceivably minute fragments
were caused by enormous steam pressure in the interior and the sudden expansion of the masses
blown out into the atmosphere.  Of this glassy dust, that which was blown into the regions
beyond the clouds must have been much finer even than that which was examined.  These glass
fragments were said by Dr Flugel to contain either innumerable air-bubbles or minute needle-like
crystals, or both.  Small though these vesicles were when ejected from the volcano, they would
become still smaller by bursting when they suddenly reached a much lower pressure of atmosphere
at a great height. Some of them, however, owing to tenacity of material and other causes, might
have failed to burst and would remain floating in the upper air as perfect microscopic glass
balloons.  Thus the dust was a mass of particles of every conceivable shape, and so fine that
no watches, boxes, or instruments were tight enough to exclude from their interior even that
portion of the dust which was heavy enough to remain on earth!

He stooped with the intention of grasping Winnie as if she were a little child, but with a
light laugh the girl sprang away and left Moses behind.

"'S'my opinion," said Moses, looking after her with a grin, "dat if de purfesser was here he'd
net her in mistook for a bufferfly.  Dar!--she's down!" he shouted, springing forward, but
Nigel was before him.

Winnie had tripped and fallen.

"Are you hurt, dear--child?" asked Nigel, raising her gently.

"Oh no! only a little shaken," answered Winnie, with a little laugh that was half hysterical.
"I am strong enough to go on presently."

"Nay, my child, you must suffer yourself to be carried at this part," said Van der Kemp.  "Take
her up, Nigel, you are stronger than I am now.  I would not have asked you to do it before
my accident!"

Our hero did not need a second bidding.  Grasping Winnie in his strong arms he raised her as
if she had been a feather, and strode away at a pace so rapid that he soon left Van der Kemp
and Moses far behind.

"Put me down, now," said Winnie, after a little while, in a low voice. "I'm quite recovered
now and can walk."

"Nay, Winnie, you are mistaken.  The path is very rough yet, and the dust gets deeper as we
ascend.  Do give me the pleasure of helping you a little longer."

Whatever Winnie may have felt or thought she said nothing, and Nigel, taking silence for consent,
bore her swiftly onward and upward,--with an "Excelsior" spirit that would have thrown the
Alpine youth with the banner and the strange device considerably into the shade,--until he
placed her at the yawning black mouth of the hermit's cave.

But what a change was there!  The trees and flowering shrubs and ferns were all gone, lava,
pumice, and ashes lay thick on everything around, and only a few blackened and twisted stumps
of the larger trees remained to tell that an umbrageous forest had once flourished there. 
The whole scene might be fittingly described in the two words--grey desolation.

"That is the entrance to your father's old home," said Nigel, as he set his fair burden down
and pointed to the entrance.

"What a dreadful place!" said Winnie, peering into the black depths of the cavern.

"It was not dreadful when I first saw it, Winnie, with rich verdure everywhere; and inside
you will find it surprisingly comfortable.  But we must not enter until your father arrives
to do the honours of the place himself."

They had not to wait long.  First Moses arrived, and, shrewdly suspecting from the appearance
of the young couple that they were engaged in conversation that would not brook interruption,
or, perhaps, judging from what might be his own wishes in similar circumstances, he turned
his back suddenly on them, and, stooping down, addressed himself to an imaginary creature of
the animal kingdom.

"Try it!" cried Nigel, "I won't fail you."

It is not possible for any except those who have gone through a somewhat similar ordeal to
understand fully the test of cool courage which Van der Kemp had to undergo on that occasion.

Shutting his eyes for a moment in silent prayer, he deliberately worked with his shoulders
upon the cliff against which he leaned until he felt himself to be on the point of falling
towards his friend, and the two outstretched hands almost touched.

"Now, are you ready?" he asked.

"Ready," replied Nigel, while Moses wound both his powerful arms round his comrade's waist
and held on.

Another moment and the hands clasped, Nigel uttered an irrepressible shout as the hermit swung
off, and, coming round with great violence to the spot where the negro had fixed himself, just
succeeded in catching the edge of the cliff with his free hand.

"Let go, Nigel," he shouted;--"safe!"

The poor youth was only too glad to obey, for the tremendous pull had wrenched his arm out
of the crevice in which he had fixed it, and for a moment he swayed helplessly over the awful
abyss.

"Don't let me go, Moses!" he yelled, as he made a frantic but futile effort to regain his hold,--for
he felt that the negro had loosened one of his arms though the other was still round him like
a hoop of iron.

"No fear, Nadgel," said Moses, "I's got you tight--only don' wriggle. Now, massa, up you come."

Moses had grasped his master's hair with a grip that well-nigh scalped him, and he held on
until the hermit had got a secure hold of the ledge with both hands.  Then he let the hair
go, for he knew that to an athlete like his master the raising himself by his arms on to the
ledge would be the work of a few seconds.  Van der Kemp was thus able to assist in rescuing
Nigel from his position of danger.

But the expressions of heartfelt thankfulness for this deliverance which naturally broke from
them were abruptly checked when it was found that Moses could by no means extract his leg out
of the hole into which he had thrust it, and that he was suffering great pain. 

Ha! ha!'so diggin his leg over a back, he added:'we doan't cum quiet leabes to'lir, like a wailing's--

"My poor fellow!" murmured Van der Kemp, as he went down on his knees to examine the limb.
