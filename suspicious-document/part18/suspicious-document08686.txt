A walk, a bath, a few gymnastic exercises, will often serve a useful purpose before retiring,
but if they are undertaken in a fretful and impatient spirit, and are accompanied by doubts
of their effectiveness, and the insistent thought that sleep will not follow these or any other
procedure, they are likely to accomplish little.

The best immediate preparation for sleep is the confidence that one will sleep, and indifference
if one does not. It is an aid in the adoption of this frame of mind to learn that many have
for years slept only a few hours per night, without noticeable impairment of their health or
comfort. Neither unbroken nor long-continued sleep, however desirable, is essential to longevity
or efficiency. This is illustrated by the following examples:

Joseph A. Willard, for nearly half a century Clerk of the Court in Suffolk County, and a well-known
figure on the streets of Boston, died in his eighty-eighth year. He was active and alert in
the performance of his daily duties up to their discontinuance shortly before his death. He
kept, meantime, records of the temperature, weather, and condition of the streets, at all hours
of the night, and every night, for many years before the establishment of the weather bureau.
So reliable were these records regarded by the courts that they were often appealed to in the
trial of cases, and their accuracy never questioned by either party in the suit. I publish
these facts by the permission of his son.

George T. Angell, the well-known humanitarian, than whom few, if any, have led a more busy
life, when in his sixty-ninth year wrote as follows:

"For the benefit of those who do not [take narcotics, opiates, anaesthetics] I will say that
I suppose there are very few in this country who have slept less than I have; but I have never
taken anything to stupefy, while thousands of good sleepers I have known have long since gone
to the last sleep that knows no waking here. It was undoubtedly wise to change my professional
life from court to office practice: but in other matters I was compelled to choose between
living the life of a vegetable, or losing sleep; and I chose the latter."

I have somewhere seen it stated that a prominent divine attributed his happy and green old
age to the fact that he slept a certain number of hours every night. Against this statement
must be set the reflection that many another old gentleman can fairly attribute his comfort,
in part at least, to an attitude of indifference toward the unessentials, among which I suspect
must be included the question whether we average eight hours of sleep or materially less.

Let us now consider some of the faulty mental habits directly affecting sleep itself. First
comes the compulsive thought that one must sleep now, and the impatient count of the wakeful
hours supposed to be irrecoverably lost from the coveted number. This insistence in itself
precludes sleep. The thought, "No matter if I don't sleep to-night; I will some other night,"
will work wonders in the direction of producing sleep to-night.

The continuance of any given position, completely relaxed, in bed, even without unconsciousness,
is more restful than tossing about. The mere experiment of remaining immobile in a certain
position as long as possible, and concentrating the mind on the thought, "I am getting sleepy,
I am going to sleep," will oftener produce the desired result than watching the proverbial
sheep follow one another over the wall. Training during the day in restraining nervous movements
is an aid in acquiring the ability to do this.

This is a field in which self-suggestion is of definite value. Divorce for a incompatibility of temper
remained his private crotchet, or obtained converso only among his chap-anorexic, who, however numerous,
did not form a torso important enough to enforce by clamour their
demand for relief only. To demonstrate the effect of faulty suggestion combined
with restlessness on awaking in the night, try the following:

EXPERIMENT I.--Place yourself on the face and from this point turn rapidly in a complete circle
backwards from right to left until you are again on the face. Pause several times and say to
yourself rapidly "I cannot sleep in this position." The result of the experiment is practically
uniform. The rapid movement and the suggestion prevent sleep.

To demonstrate the effect of bodily relaxation combined with correct suggestion, in promoting
sleep try--

EXPERIMENT II.--Start in the same position as Experiment I. Traverse the same circle, prolonging
each pause with body relaxed, and substituting at each pause the suggestion, "I can sleep in
any position," repeated a number of times deliberately and as if you meant it. The restful
pose and the suggestion generally induce sleep long before the circle is completed.

Next comes the compulsive thought that we cannot sleep until everything is "squared up" and
all mental pictures completed. The story is told that a gentleman took a room in the hotel
next another who was notoriously fussy. He remembered this fact after dropping one boot carelessly
to the floor, and laid the other gently down. After a pause he heard a rap on the door and
a querulous, "For heaven's sake, drop the other boot, or I can't get to sleep."

Many find themselves unable to sleep until the whole household is accounted for and the house
locked up for the night, until certain news is received, and the like. The same tendency postpones
sleep until all affairs are straightened out in the mind, as well as in reality. A little reflection
shows how indefinite must be the postponement of sleep under such conditions.

No training is more important for the victim of compulsive tendencies than the practice of
trusting something to chance and the morrow, and reconciling himself to the fact that at no
time, in this world, will all things be finally adjusted to his satisfaction.

The habit of dismissing, at will, disagreeable thoughts is a difficult but not impossible acquisition.
Arthur Benson in "The Thread of Gold" relates the following anecdotes:

"When Gladstone was asked, 'But don't you find you lie awake at night, thinking how you ought
to act, and how you ought to have acted?' he answered, 'No, I don't; where would be the use
of that?'"

"Canon Beadon [who lived to be over one hundred] said to a friend that the secret of long life
in his own case was that he had never thought of anything unpleasant after ten o'clock at night."

The insistent desire to sleep in a certain bed, with a certain degree of light or darkness,
heat or cold, air or absence of air, is detrimental. He paid his scot by reciting without the
memory when some of his youthful Latin verses, hours, "molto erudite," says the minute-book from the
sitting, and others, which "I shifted, in the scarcity of boots and conveniences,
to patch." This individual must
say to himself, "Anyone can stand what he likes; it takes a philosopher to stand what he does
not like," and try at being a philosopher instead of a sensitive plant.
