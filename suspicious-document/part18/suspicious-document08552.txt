INTRODUCTION

It was on the road from Neufchateau to La Foche, where Base Hospital 117 was located, that
I first became acquainted with the author of this book. He evidently knew how to run a Ford
camionette, even though it was not in just the shape in which it left the factory. I remember
that I asked him what he did for a living back in the States--those service uniforms were great
levelers--and he said he was a parson. "But now you are a chauffeur," I objected. "Well, you
see," he said, "when I first came over they asked me to fill out blanks indicating what I could
do, and in that statement I admitted that I could run a car. I also said I could preach. They
tried me out as a chauffeur and liked my work so well that they said they would stand pat on
that; they had never heard me preach."

As a matter of fact, I heard Mr. West preach that morning to the boys suffering from war neurosis,
or "shell shock," in Hospital 117. He had helped them out on former Sundays there, and they
sent for him again and again.

Later, when I was in the Baccarat sector, I met a most interesting and effective man who was
in the Supply Department of the "Y" on week days, and conducted services in outlying camps
every Sunday morning with great success. He had been a circus acrobat back in the States. What
a revolutionizing influence war is, with preachers chauffeuring and acrobats preaching! The
important point was that they were all serving whole-heartedly in whatever way they could.

It was in Baccarat that I met West again, running his car, transporting newspapers or moving-picture
machines, or canteen supplies, or itinerant entertainers such as I, out over any sort of road
toward the front line. His glimpses of the great war were from an angle of vision that makes
what he has to say in this book well worth reading. His duties took him into every sort of
billet, and brought him into close touch with many branches of the army, as well as with all
sorts of welfare work and workers. I find that he refers, in passing, to that dramatic moment
when we stood on a hilltop and watched the bombing of Baccarat just below us, while the Boche
machine passed very close overhead. He does not say that he hid behind one tree and I hid behind
another, trying to keep the trunks between us and the flying shrapnel. Nor does he say that
he picked up and carried home a fragment which landed between us in the road, although it came
just as near to me as it did to him!

This started out to be an introduction to a book. It is really a personal expression of good
will toward one whom I was glad to meet and touch for a moment in that strange whirlpool of
human activity last summer in France.

CHAPTER I

FIVE WEEKS IN A FLIVVER

"Halt!"

When above the noise and rattle of the car--for a Ford always carries a rattle--you hear the
stentorian command of the guard, instantly every stopping device is automatically applied.

"Who Goes There?"

"A friend with the countersign."

"Advance! and give the countersign."

The guard at charge, with bayonet fixed, awaits your coming. When you get within a few feet
of the point of his bayonet the guard again commands, "Halt!" In the silence and blackness
of the night you whisper the password and if he is satisfied that you are indeed a friend he
says, "Pass, friend." If he is not satisfied you are detained until your identity has been
established.

No matter how many hundreds of times you hear the challenge ring out, each time you hear it
a new thrill runs through your whole being and a new respect for military authority holds you
captive, for you instinctively know that behind that challenge is the cold steel and a deadly
missile.

It was a splendidly camouflaged camionette that I inherited from Hughes when I went to Baccarat
on the Alsatian border. In all my dangerous trips, by night and day, it never failed, and I
think back to it now with a tenderness bordering on affection.

My first day on the job I was sent out to five huts with supplies, driving my own car and piloting
the men who were sent out to pilot me. Although they had been over the roads and were supposed
to know the way, they did not have a good sense of direction and so were easily lost.

The headquarters of the 37th Division were at Baccarat on the Alsatian border. Strasburg lay
fifty miles to the east and Metz fifty-five miles to the northwest. To hold this front, an
area fifteen to twenty miles long, was the task of the Ohio boys until they were relieved by
the French the middle of September and sent into the Argonne Forest.
