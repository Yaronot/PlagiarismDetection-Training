Not a sign of any sort was displayed about the habitation. No man was invited to enter, no
man warned to keep out, none was anywhere in sight. The stage men dismounted, threw their lines,
pushed open the front door of the house and entered a room of perhaps sixteen by twenty feet.
It had been the original barroom. A long, high, elaborately carved mahogany bar, as much out
of keeping as it possibly could be with its surroundings, stretched across the farther side
of the room. The left end, as they faced the bar, was brought around to escape a small window
opening on a court or patio to the rear of the room. Back of the bar itself, about midway,
a low door in the bare wall gave entrance to a rear room. Aside from this big, queer-looking
piece of mahogany, the low window at the left end of it, and the low door at the back, the
room presented nothing but walls. Two windows flanking the front door helped to light it, but
not a mirror, picture, chair, table, bottle, or glass was to be seen. De Spain covered every
feature of the interior at a glance. "Quiet around here, John," he remarked casually.

"This is the quietest place in the Rocky Mountains most of the time. But when it is noisy,
believe me, it is noisy. Look at the bullet-holes in the walls."

"The old story," remarked de Spain, inspecting with mild-mannered interest the punctured plastering,
"they always shoot high."

He walked over to the left end of the bar, noting the hard usage shown by the ornate mahogany,
and spreading his hands wide open, palms down, on the face of it, glanced at the low window
on his left, opening on the gravelled patio. He peered, in the semidarkness, at the battered
door behind the bar.

"Henry," observed Lefever, "if you are looking for a drink, it would only be fair, as well
as politic, to call the Mexican."

"Thank you, John, I'm not looking for one. And I know you don't drink."

"You want to know, then, where the Mexican keeps his gun?" hazarded Lefever.

"Not especially. I just want to know----"

"Everything."

"What's behind the bar. That's natural, isn't it?"

Very complete fittings and compartments told of the labor spent in preparing this inner side
for the convenience of the bartender and the requirements of exacting patrons, but nothing
in the way of equipment, not so much as a pewter spoon, lay anywhere visible.

De Spain, turning, looked all around the room again. "You wouldn't think," he said slowly,
"from looking at the place there was a road-agent within a thousand miles."

"You wouldn't think, from riding through the Superstition Mountains there was a lion within
a thousand miles. I've hunted them for eleven years, and I never saw one except when the dogs
drove 'em out; but for eleven years they saw me. If we haven't been seen coming in here by
some of this Calabasas bunch, I miss my guess," declared Lefever cheerfully.

The batten door behind the bar now began to open slowly and noiselessly. Lefever peered through
it. "Come in, Pedro," he cried reassuringly, "come in, man. This is no officer, no revenue
agent looking for your license. Meet a friend, Pedro," he continued encouragingly, as the swarthy
publican, low-browed and sullen, emerged very deliberately from the inner darkness into the
obscurity of the barroom, and bent his one good eye searchingly on de Spain. "This," Lefever's
left hand lay familiarly on the back of de Spain's shoulder, "is our new manager, Mr. Henry
de Spain. Henry, shake hands with Mexico."

This invitation to shake hands seemed an empty formality. De Spain never shook hands with anybody;
at least if he did so, he extended, through habit long inured, his left hand, with an excuse
for the soreness of his right. Pedro did not even bat his remaining eye at the invitation.
The situation, as Lefever facetiously remarked, remained about where it was before he spoke,
and nothing daunted, he asked de Spain what he would drink. De Spain sidestepped again by asking
for a cigar. Lefever, professing he would not drink alone, called for cigarettes. While Pedro
produced them, from nowhere apparently, as a conjurer picks cards out of the air, the sound
of galloping horses came through the open door. A moment later three men walked, single file,
into the room. De Spain stood at the left end of the bar, and Lefever introduced him to Gale
Morgan, to David Sassoon, and to Sassoon's crony, Deaf Sandusky, as the new stage-line manager.
The later arrivals lined up before the bar, Sandusky next to Lefever and de Spain, so he could
hear what was said. Pedro from his den produced two queer-looking bottles and a supply of glasses.

"De Spain," Gale Morgan began bluntly, "one of our men was put off a stage of yours last week
by Frank Elpaso." He spoke without any preliminary compliments, and his heavy voice was bellicose.

De Spain, regarding him undisturbed, answered after a little pause: "Elpaso told me he put
a man off his stage last week for fighting."

"No," contradicted Morgan loudly, "not for fighting. Elpaso was drunk."

"What's the name of the man Elpaso put off, John?" asked de Spain, looking at Lefever.

Morgan hooked his thumb toward the man standing at his side. "Here's the man right here, Dave
Sassoon."

Sassoon never looked a man in the face when the man looked at him, except by implication; it
was almost impossible, without surprising him, to catch his eyes with your eyes. He seemed
now to regard de Spain keenly, as the latter, still attending to Morgan's statement, replied:
"Elpaso tells a pretty straight story."

"Elpaso couldn't tell a straight story if he tried," interjected Sassoon.

"I have the statement of three other passengers; they confirm Elpaso. According to them, Sassoon--"
de Spain looked straight at the accused, "was drunk and abusive, and kept trying to put some
of the other passengers off. Finally he put his feet in the lap of Pumperwasser, our tank and
windmill man, and Pumperwasser hit him."

Morgan, stepping back from the bar, waved his hand with an air of finality toward his inoffensive
companion: "Here is Sassoon, right here--he can tell the whole story."

"Those fellows were miners," muttered Sassoon. His utterance was broken, but he spoke fast.
"They'll side with the guards every time against a cattleman."

"There's only one fair thing to do, de Spain," declared Morgan. He looked severely at de Spain:
"Discharge Elpaso."

De Spain, his hands resting on the bar, drew one foot slowly back. "Not on the showing I have
now," he said. "One of the passengers who joined in the statement is Jeffries, the railroad
superintendent at Sleepy Cat."

"Expect a railroad superintendent to tell the truth about a Calabasas man?" demanded Sassoon.

"I should expect him at least to be sober," retorted de Spain.

"Sassoon," interposed Morgan belligerently, "is a man whose word can always be depended on."

"To convey his meaning," intervened Lefever cryptically. "Of course, I know," he asserted,
earnest to the point of vehemence. "Every one in Calabasas has the highest respect for Sassoon.
That is understood. And," he added with as much impressiveness as if he were talking sense,
"everybody in Calabasas would be sorry to see Sassoon put off a stage. But Sassoon is off:
that is the situation. We are sorry. If it occurs again----"

"What do you mean?" thundered Morgan, resenting the interference. "De Spain is the manager,
isn't he? What we want to know is, what you are going to do about it?" he demanded, addressing
de Spain again.

"There is nothing more to be done," returned de Spain composedly. "I've already told Elpaso
if Sassoon starts another fight on a stage to put him off again."

Morgan's fist came down on the bar. "Look here, de Spain! You come from Medicine Bend, don't
you? Well, you can't bully Music Mountain men--understand that."

"Any time you have a real grievance, Morgan, I'll be glad to consider it," said de Spain. "When
one of your men is drunk and quarrelsome he will be put off like any other disturber. That
we can't avoid. Public stages can't be run any other way."

"All right," retorted Morgan. "If you take that tack for your new management, we'll see how
you get along running stages down in this country."

"We will run them peaceably, just as long as we can," smiled de Spain. "We will get on with
everybody that gives us a chance."

Morgan pointed a finger at him. "I give you a chance, de Spain, right now. Will you discharge
Elpaso?"

"No."

Morgan almost caught his breath at the refusal. But de Spain could be extremely blunt, and
in the parting shots between the two he gave no ground.

"Jeffries put me here to stop this kind of rowdyism on the stages," he said to Lefever on their
way back to the barn. "This is a good time to begin. And Sassoon and Gale Morgan are good men
to begin with," he added.

As the horses of the two men emerged from the canyon they saw a slender horsewoman riding in
toward the barn from the Music Mountain trail. She stopped in front of McAlpin, the barn boss,
who stood outside the office door. McAlpin, the old Medicine Bend barnman, had been promoted
from Sleepy Cat by the new manager. De Spain recognized the roan pony, but, aside from that,
a glance at the figure of the rider, as she sat with her back to him, was enough to assure
him of Nan Morgan. He spurred ahead fast enough to overhear a request she was making of McAlpin
to mail a letter for her. She also asked McAlpin, just as de Spain drew up, whether the down
stage had passed. McAlpin told her it had. De Spain, touching his hat, spoke: "I am going right
up to Sleepy Cat. I'll mail your letter if you wish."

She looked at him in some surprise, and then glanced toward Lefever, who now rode up. De Spain
was holding out his hand for the letter. His eyes met Nan's, and each felt the moment was a
sort of challenge. De Spain, a little self-conscious under her inspection, was aware only of
her rather fearless eyes and the dark hair under her fawn cowboy hat.

"Thank you," she responded evenly. "If the stage is gone I will hold it to add something."
So saying, she tucked the letter inside her blouse and spoke to her pony, which turned leisurely
down the road.

"I'm trying to get acquainted with your country to-day," returned de Spain, managing with his
knee to keep his own horse moving alongside Nan as she edged away.

She seemed disinclined to answer, but the silence and the awkwardness of his presence drew
at length a dry disclaimer: "This is not my country."

"I understood," exclaimed de Spain, following his doubtful advantage, "you lived out this way."

"I live near Music Mountain," returned Nan somewhat ungraciously, using her own skill at the
same time to walk her horse away from her unwelcome companion.

"I've heard of Music Mountain," continued de Spain, urging his lagging steed. "I've often wanted
to get over there to hunt."

Nan, without speaking, ruthlessly widened the distance between the two. De Spain unobtrusively
spurred his steed to greater activity. "You must have a great deal of game around you. Do you
hunt?" he asked.

He knew she was famed as a huntress, but he could make no headway whatever against her studied
reserve. He watched her hands, graceful even in heavy gloves; he noticed the neck-piece of
her tan blouse, and liked the brown throat and the chin set so resolutely against him. He surmised
that she perhaps felt some contempt for him because she had outshot him, and he continued to
ask about game, hoping for a chance in some far-off time to redeem his marksmanship before
her and giving her every possible chance to invite him to try the hunting around Music Mountain.

She was deaf to the broadest hints; and when at length she excused herself and turned her pony
from the Sleepy Cat road into the Morgan Gap trail, de Spain had been defeated in every attempt
to arouse the slightest interest in anything he had said. But, watching with regret, at the
parting, the trim lines of her figure as she dashed away on the desert trail, seated as if
a part of her spirited horse, he felt only a fast-rising resolution to attempt again to break
through her stubborn reticence and know her better.

CHAPTER IV

FIRST BLOOD AT CALABASAS

Nothing more than de Spain's announcement that he would sustain his stage-guards was necessary
to arouse a violent resentment at Calabasas and among the Morgan following. Some of the numerous
disaffected were baiting the stages most of the time. They bullied the guards, fought the passengers,
and fomented discontent among the drivers. In all Thief River disturbances, whether a raid
on cattlemen, a stage hold-up, a gun fight, or a tedious war of words, the Calabasas men, sometimes
apparently for the mere maintaining of prestige, appeared to take leading rôles. After de Spain's
declaration the grievance against Elpaso was made a general one along the line. His stage was
singled out and ridden at times both by Sandusky and Logan--the really dangerous men of the
Spanish Sinks--and by Gale Morgan and Sassoon to stir up trouble.

But old Frank Elpaso was far from being a fool. A fight with any one of these men meant that
somebody would be killed, and no one could tell just who, Elpaso shrewdly reckoned, until the
roll-call at the end of it. He therefore met truculence with diplomacy, threatening looks with
flattery, and hard words with a long story. Moreover, all Calabasas knew that Elpaso, if he
had to, would fight, and that the eccentric guard was not actually to be cornered with impunity.
Even Logan, who, like Sandusky, was known to be without fear and without mercy, felt at least
a respect for Elpaso's shortened shotgun, and stopped this side actual hostilities with him.
When the June clean-up of the No. 2 Thief River mine came through--one hundred and six thousand
dollars in gold bullion under double guard--and a Calabasas contingent of night-riders tried
to stop the treasure, rumor along the Sinks had it that Elpaso's slugs, delivered at the right
moment, were responsible for Deaf Sandusky's long illness at Bear Dance, and the failure of
the subsequent masked attack on the up stage.

Sassoon, however, owing to the indignity now put upon him, also nourished a particular grievance
against the meditative guard, and his was one not tempered either by prudence or calculation.
His chance came one night when Elpaso had unwisely allowed himself to be drawn into a card
game at Calabasas Inn. Elpaso was notoriously a stickler for a square deal at cards. He was
apparently the only man at Calabasas that hoped for such a thing, and certainly the only one
so rash as to fight for it--yet he always did. A dispute on this occasion found him without
a friend in the room. Sassoon reached for him with a knife.

McAlpin was the first to get the news at the barn. He gave first aid to the helpless guard,
and, without dreaming he could be got to a surgeon alive, rushed him in a light wagon to the
hospital at Sleepy Cat, where it was said that he must have more lives than a wildcat. Sassoon,
not caring to brave de Spain's anger in town, went temporarily into hiding. A second surgeon
was brought from Medicine Bend, and heroic efforts were put forth to nurse again into life
the feeble spark the assassin had left in the unlucky guard.

Word of this cutting reached de Spain at Thief River. He started for Calabasas, learned there
during a brief stop what he could--which was, of course, next to nothing--of the affray, and
posted on to Sleepy Cat.

A conference was held in Jeffries's office. De Spain, Lefever, and some of the division staff
discussed the situation raised by the affair. De Spain was instructed to see that Sassoon was
brought in and made an example of for the benefit of his Calabasas friends. Accordingly, while
the guard's life hung in the balance, the sheriff, Jim Druel, was despatched after Sassoon.
A great deal of inquiry, much riding, and a lot of talk on Druel's part accomplished nothing.

Lefever spoiled with impatience to get after Sassoon. "The only way we'll ever get one of that
gang is to go for him ourselves," said he. The sheriff's campaign did collapse. Sassoon could
not be found although rumor was notorious that he continued to haunt Calabasas. Lefever's irritation
grew. "Never mind, John," counselled de Spain, "forget about wanting him. Sometime one of us
will stumble on him, and when we do we'll shackle him." The precaution was taken, meantime,
to secure a warrant for the missing man, together with authority for either of the two to serve
it. Elpaso, in the end, justified his old reputation by making a recovery--haltingly, it is
true, and with perilous intervals of sinking, but a recovery.

It was while he still lay in the hospital and hope was very low that de Spain and Lefever rode,
one hot morning, into Calabasas and were told by McAlpin that Sassoon had been seen within
five minutes at the inn. To Lefever the news was like a bubbling spring to a thirsty man. His
face beamed, he tightened his belt, shook out his gun, and looked with benevolent interest
on de Spain, who stood pondering. "If you will stay right here, Henry," he averred convincingly,
"I will go over and get Sassoon."

The chief stage-guard, Bob Scott, the Indian, was in the barn. He smiled at Lefever's enthusiasm.
"Sassoon," said he, "is slippery."

"You'd better let us go along and see you do it," suggested de Spain, who with the business
in hand grew thoughtful.

"Gentlemen, I thank you," protested Lefever, raising one hand in deprecation, the other resting
lightly on his holster. "We still have some little reputation to maintain along the Sinks.
Don't let us make it a posse for Sassoon." No one opposed him further, and he rode away alone.

"It won't be any trouble for John to bring Sassoon in," murmured Scott, who spoke with a smile
and in the low tone and deliberate manner of the Indian, "if he can find him."

With de Spain, Scott remained in front of the barn, saddled horses in hand. They could see
nothing of the scene of action, and de Spain was forced in idleness to curb his impatience.
Lefever rode down to the inn without seeing a living thing anywhere about it. When he dismounted
in front he thought he heard sounds within the barroom, but, pushing open the door and looking
circumspectly into the room before entering, he was surprised to find it empty.

There was something, under the circumstances and in the stimulus of danger, almost uncanny
in the silence, the absence of any life whatever about the place. Lefever walked cautiously
inside; there seemed no need of caution. No one was there to confront or oppose him. Surveying
the interior with a rapid glance, he walked to the left end of the bar and, gun in readiness,
looked apprehensively behind it. Not so much as a strainer was to be seen underneath. He noticed,
however, that the sash of the low window on his left, which looked into the patio, was open,
and two heel-marks in the hard clay suggested that a man might have jumped through. Whether
these were Sassoon's heels or another's, Lefever decided they constituted his clew, and, running
out of the front door, he sprang into his saddle and rode to where he could signal de Spain
and Scott to come up.

He told his story as they joined him, and the three returned to the inn. Scott rode directly
to the rear. Lefever took de Spain in to the bar, showed him the open sash, and pointed to
the heel-prints. De Spain stepped through the window, Lefever following. An examination showed
the slide of a spur-rowel behind one heel-mark and indications of a hasty jump.

While they bent over the signs that seemed to connect their quarry with the place, a door opened
across the courtyard, and Pedro appeared. He was curiously dense to all inquiries, and Lefever,
convinced that Sassoon was somewhere at hand, revenged himself by searching the place.

In the dark kitchen a very old woman and a slovenly girl were at work. No one else was to be
found anywhere.

De Spain, who was the more experienced tracker, thought he could follow the footprints to the
arched opening across the patio. This was closed only by a swinging gate, and afforded easy
escape from a pursuer. At some distance outside this gate, as de Spain threw it open, sat Bob
Scott on his horse. De Spain made inquiry of Scott. No one had been seen. Returning to Lefever,
who, greatly chagrined, had convinced himself that Sassoon had got away, de Spain called Scott
into the patio.

A better tracker than either of his companions, Scott after a minute confirmed their belief
that Sassoon must have escaped by the window. He then took the two men out to where some one,
within a few minutes, had mounted a horse and galloped off.

"But where has he gone?" demanded Lefever, pointing with his hand. "There is the road both
ways for three miles." Scott nodded toward the snow-capped peak of Music Mountain. "Over to
Morgan's, most likely. He knows no one would follow him into the Gap. Just for fun, now, let's
see."

Dismounting, the Indian scrutinized the hoof-prints where the horse had stood. Getting into
the saddle again, he led the way, bending over his horse's neck and stopping frequently to
read the trail, half a mile out along the Gap road, until he could once more readily point
out the hoof-prints to his companions. "That is Sassoon," he announced. "I know the heels.
And I know he rides this horse; it belongs to Gale Morgan. Sassoon," Scott smiled sympathetically
on Lefever, "is half-way to Morgan's Gap."

"After him!" cried Lefever hotly. De Spain looked inquiringly at the guard. Scott shook his
head. "That would be all right, but there's two other Calabasas men in the Gap this afternoon
it wouldn't be nice to mix with--Deaf Sandusky and Harvey Logan."

"We won't mix with them," suggested de Spain.

"If we tackle Sassoon, they'll mix with us," explained Scott. He reflected a moment. "They
always stay at Gale Morgan's or Duke's. We might sneak Sassoon out without their getting on.
Sassoon knows he is safe in the Gap; but he'll hide even after he gets there. He takes two
precautions for every other man's one. Sassoon is a wonder at hiding out. I've got the Thief
River run this afternoon----"

De Spain looked at him. "Well?"

Scott's face softened into the characteristic smile--akin to a quiet grin--that it often wore.
"If I didn't have to go through to-day, and the three of us could get to the Gap before daylight
to-morrow morning, I would give Sassoon a run for his money in spite of the other fellows."

"Don't take your run this afternoon," directed de Spain. "Telephone Sleepy Cat for a substitute.
Suppose we go back, get something to eat, and you two ride singly over toward the Gap this
afternoon; lie outside under cover to see whether Sassoon or his friends leave before night--there's
only one way out of the place, they tell me. Then I will join you, and we'll ride in before
daylight, and perhaps catch him while everybody is asleep."

"If you do," predicted Scott, in his deliberate way of expressing a conclusion, "I think you'll
get him."

It was so arranged.

CHAPTER V

ROUNDING UP SASSOON

De Spain joined his associates at dark outside the Gap. Neither Sassoon nor his friends had
been seen. The night was still, the sky cloudless, and as the three men with a led horse rode
at midnight into the mountains, the great red heart of the Scorpion shone afire in the southern
sky. Spreading out when they rode between the mountain walls, they made their way without interruption
silently toward their rendezvous, an aspen grove near which Purgatoire Creek makes its way
out of the Gap and, cutting a deep gash along the edge of the range for a hundred miles, empties
into the Thief.

Scott was the first to reach the trees. The little grove spreads across a slope half a mile
wide between the base of one towering cliff, still bearing its Spanish name, El Capitan, and
the gorge of the Purgatoire. To the east of this point the trails to Calabasas and to Sleepy
Cat divide, and here Scott and Lefever received de Spain, who had ridden slowly and followed
Scott's injunctions to keep the red star to the right of El Capitan all the way across the Sinks.

Securing their horses, the three stretched out on the open ground to wait for daylight. De
Spain was wakeful, and his eyes rested with curiosity on the huge bulk of Music Mountain, rising
overwhelmingly above him. Through the Gap that divided the great, sentinel-like front of El
Capitan, marking the northern face of the mountain rift, from Round Top, the south wall of
the opening, stars shone vividly, as if lighting the way into the silent range beyond.

The breathing of his companions soon assured de Spain that both were asleep. The horses were
quiet, and the night gave no sound save that vaguely through the darkness came the faint brawl
of tiny cataracts tumbling down far mountain heights. De Spain, lying on his side, his head
resting on his elbow, and his hands clasped at the back of his neck, meditated first on how
he should capture Sassoon at daybreak, and then on Nan Morgan and her mountain home, into which
he was about to break to drag out a criminal. Sassoon and his malice soon drifted out of his
mind, but Nan remained. She stayed with him, it seemed, for hours--appearing and disappearing,
in one aspect more alluring than another. Then her form outlined in the mists that rose from
the hidden creek seemed to hover somewhere near until Scott's hand laid on the dreamer's shoulder
drove it suddenly away. Day was at hand.

De Spain got up and shook off the chilliness and drowsiness of the night. It had been agreed
that he, being less known in the Gap than either of his companions, could best attempt the
difficult capture. It was strictly a coup de main, depending for its success on chance and
nerve. The one that tried it might manage to bring out his man--or might be brought out himself.
Between these alternatives there was not much middle ground, except that failing to find Sassoon,
or in case he should be intercepted with his prisoner, the intruder, escaping single-handed
from a shower of bullets, might still get away. But Morgan's Gap men were esteemed fairly good
marksmen.

Bob Scott, who knew the recess well, repeated his explicit directions as to how de Spain was
to reach Sassoon's shack. He repeated his description of its interior, told him where the bed
stood, and even where Sassoon ordinarily kept his knife and his revolver. The western sky was
still dark when de Spain, mounting, discussed the last arrangements with his scouts and, taking
the bridle of the led horse, turned toward Round Top. At its narrowest point the Gap opening
is barely two miles wide, and the one road, in and out, lies among the rocks through this neck;
toward it all trails inside the Gap converge. De Spain gave his horse his head--it was still
too dark to distinguish the path--and depended on his towering landmarks for his general direction.
He advanced at a snail's pace until he passed the base of El Capitan, when of a sudden, as
he rode out from among high projecting rocks full into the opening, faint rays of light from
the eastern dawn revealed the narrow, strangely enclosed and perfectly hidden valley before
him. The eastern and southern sides still lay in darkness, but the stupendous cliffs frowning
on the north and west were lighted somewhat from the east. The southern wall, though shrouded,
seemed to rise in an unending series of beetling arêtes.

De Spain caught his breath. No description he had ever heard of the nook that screened the
Morgans from the outside world had prepared him for what he saw. From side to side of the gigantic
mountain fissure, it could hardly be, de Spain thought, more than a few thousand yards--so
completely was his sense of proportion stunned by the frowning cliffs which rose, at points,
half a mile into the sky. But it was actually several miles from wall to wall, and the Gap
was more than as much in depth, as it ran back to a mere wedge between unnamed Superstition peaks.

Every moment that he pushed ahead warned him that daylight would come suddenly and his time
to act would be short. The trail he followed broadened into a road, and he strained his eyes
for signs, first of life, and then of habitation. The little creek, now beside his way, flowed
quietly albeit swiftly along, and his utmost vigilance could detect no living thing stirring;
but a turn in the trail, marked by a large pine-tree and conforming to a bend of the stream,
brought him up startled and almost face to face with a long, rambling ranch-house. The gable
end of the two-story portion of the building was so close to him that he instantly reined up
to seek hiding from its upper and lower windows.

From Scott's accurate description he knew the place. This was Duke Morgan's ranch-house, set
as a fortress almost at the mouth of the Gap. To pass it unobserved was to compass the most
ticklish part of his mission, and without changing his slow pace he rode on, wondering whether
a bullet, if fired from any of the low, open windows--which he could almost throw his hat into
as he trotted past--would knock him off his horse or leave him a chance to spur away. But no
bullet challenged him and no sound came from the silent house. He cantered away from the peril,
thinking with a kind of awe of Nan, asleep, so close, under that roof--confident, too, he had
not been seen--though, in matter of fact, he had been.

He quickened his pace. The place he wanted to reach was more than a mile distant. Other cabins
back toward the north wall could be seen dimly to his right, but all were well removed from
his way. He found, in due time, the ford in the creek, as Scott had advised, made it without
mishap, scrambled up a steep and rocky path, and saw confronting him, not far ahead, a small,
ruinous-looking cabin shack. Dismounting before this, he threw his lines, shook himself a little,
and walked up to the cabin door. It was open.

The mild-minded conspirators who had planned the details of the abduction were agreed that
if the effort could be made a success at all, there was but one way to effect it, and that
was to act, in every step, openly. Any attempt to steal on Sassoon unawares would be a desperate
one; while to walk boldly into his cabin at daybreak would be to do only what his companions
were likely at any time to do, and was the course least calculated to lead to serious trouble. Spot,
it. 4. At which will take potential, them. Jesus'particularly set

"No," yelled Scott. "They would stand us a siege at Calabasas. While the trail is open make
for the railroad."

A great globe of dazzling gold burst into the east above the distant hills. But the glory of
the sunrise called forth no admiration from the three men hurrying a fourth urgently along
the Sleepy Cat trail. Between breaths de Spain explained his awkward meeting with Nan, and
of the strait he was in when Lefever's strong lungs enabled him to get away unscratched. But
for a gunman a narrow squeak is as good as a wide one, and no one found fault with the situation.
They had the advantage--the only question was whether they could hold it. And while they continued
to cast anxious glances behind, Scott's Indian eyes first perceived signs on the horizon that
marked their pursuit.

"No matter," declared Lefever. "This is a little fast for a fat man, anyway." He was not averse,
either, to the prospect of a long-range exchange with the fighting mountaineers. All drew rein
a little. "Suppose I cover the rear till we see what this is," suggested Lefever, limbering
up as the other two looked back. "Push ahead with Sassoon. These fellows won't follow far."

"Don't be sure about that," muttered Scott. "Duke and Gale have got the best horses in the
mountains, and they'd rather fight than eat. There they come now."

Dashing across a plain they themselves had just crossed, they could see three horsemen in hot
chase. The pursued men rode carefully, and, scanning the ground everywhere ahead and behind,
de Spain, Scott, and Lefever awaited the moment when their pursuers should show their hand.
Scott was on the west of the line, and nearest the enemy.

"Who are they, Bob?" yelled Lefever.

Scott scrutinized the pursuers carefully. "One," he called back, "that big fellow on the right,
is Deaf Sandusky, sure. Harvey Logan, likely, the middle man. The other I can't make out. Look!"
he exclaimed, pointing to the foot-hills on their distant left. Two men, riding out almost
abreast of them, were running their horses for a small canyon through which the trail led two
miles ahead. "Some riding," cried Scott, watching the newcomers. "That farther man must be
Gale Morgan. They are trying for the greasewood canyon, to cut us off."

"We can't stand for that," decided de Spain, surveying the ground around them. "There's not
so much as a sage-brush here for cover."

Lefever pointed to his right; at some distance a dark, weather-beaten cone rose above the yellow
desert. "Let's make a stand in the lava beds," he cried.

De Spain hesitated. "It takes us the wrong way." He pointed ahead. "Give them a run for that
canyon, boys."

Urging their horses, the Sleepy Cat men rode at utmost speed to beat the flanking party to
the trail gateway. For a few minutes it looked an even break between pursuers and pursued.
The two men in the foot-hills now had a long angle to overcome, but they were doing a better
pace than those of the Gap party behind, and half-way to the canyon it looked like a neck-and-neck
heat for the narrow entrance. Lefever complained of the effort of keeping up, and at length
reined in his horse. "Drop me here on the alkali, boys," he cried to the others. "I'll hold
this end while you get through the canyon."

"No," declared de Spain, checking his pace. "If one stays, all stay. This is as good a time
as any to find out what these fellows mean."

"But not a very good place," commented Scott, as they slowed, looking for a depression.

"It's as good for us as it is for them," returned de Spain abruptly. "We'll try it right here."

He swung out of his saddle, Lefever and Scott after an instant's reconnoissance following.
Sassoon they dismounted. Scott lashed his wrists together, while de Spain and Lefever unslung
their carbines, got their horses down, and, facing the west and south, spread themselves on
the ground.

The men behind lost nothing of the defensive movement of the pursued party, and slowed up in
turn. For the moment the flankers were out of sight, but they must soon appear on the crest
of a rise between them and the canyon. Lefever was first down and first ready with his rifle
to cover the men behind. These now spread out and came on, as if for a rush.

Lefever, picking Logan, the foremost, sent a warning shot in front of him. De Spain fired almost
at the same moment toward the big man making a détour to the right of the leader. The two bullets
puffed in the distant alkali, and the two horsemen, sharply admonished, swerved backward precipitately.
After a momentary circling indecision, the three rode closer together for a conference, dismounted,
and opened a return fire on the little party lying to.

The strategy of their halt and their firing was not hard to penetrate. The men from the foot-hills
were still riding for the canyon. No views were exchanged among Sassoon's captors, but all
understood that this move must be stopped. Lefever and Scott, without words, merely left the
problem to de Spain as the leader. He lay on the right of the line as they faced south, and
this brought him nearest to the riders out of the foot-hills. Taking advantage of a lull in
the firing, he pulled his horse around between himself and the attacking party, and in such
a position that he could command with his rifle the fast-moving riders to the west.

Something of a predicament confronted him. He was loath to take a human life in the effort
to get a cutthroat jailed, and hated even to cripple a beast for it, but the two men must be
stopped. Nor was it easy to pick up the range offhand, but meaning that the Morgans, if they
were Morgans, should understand how a rush would be met, he sent one shot after another, short,
beyond, and ahead of the horsemen, to check them, and to feel the way for closer shooting if
it should be necessary. The two dashed on undaunted. De Spain perceived that warnings were
wasted. He lowered his sights, and, waiting his chance as the leader of the foot-hill pursuers
rode into a favorable range, he fired for his horse's head. The beast jumped convulsively and
pitched forward, head down in a half somersault, throwing his rider violently to the ground.
Scott and Lefever yelled loudly.

Out of the cloud of dust the man scrambled to his feet, looked coolly around, and brushed the
alkali disgustedly from his eyes just as a second bullet from de Spain tore up the earth a
few feet to one side of him. He jumped like a rabbit at this summons, and did not even make
a further pretense at composure. Grabbing his hat from the ground, he ran like mad toward the
hills. Meantime his mounted companion had turned about. De Spain sprang to his feet, jerked
up his horse and cried: "Now for the canyon!" Pushing Sassoon into the saddle and profiting
by the confusion, the railroad men rode hard for their refuge, and reached it without more
molestation than an occasional shot from their distant pursuers on the main trail. De Spain
and his scouts now felt assured of their escape. The foot-hills contingent was left far behind,
and, though their remaining pursuers rode in at times with a show of rushing, the chase was
a stern one, and could be checked whenever necessary. Halting at times in this way to breathe
their horses, or to hold off the rear pursuit, de Spain with his two companions and their prisoner
rode into Sleepy Cat, locked Sassoon up, and went to the Mountain House for breakfast.

CHAPTER VII

MAINTAINING A REPUTATION

The abduction of Sassoon, which signalized de Spain's entry into the stage-line management,
created a sensation akin to the exploding of a bomb under the range. The whole mountain country,
which concentrates, sensibly, on but one topic at a time, talked for a week of nothing else.
No such defiance of the traditions of the Morgan rule along the reaches of the Spanish Sinks
had been attempted in years--and it was recalled more than once, when de Spain's feat was discussed
at the ranches, on the trails, and in the haunts of gunmen in Calabasas, that no one of those
who had ever braved the wrath of the Sink rulers had lived indefinitely to boast of it.

Experienced men, therefore, in the high country--men of that class who, wherever found, are
old in the ways of the world, and not promptly moved by new or youthful adventure--dismissed
the incident after hearing the details, with the comment or the conclusion that there would
hardly be for de Spain more than one additional chapter to the story, and that this would be
a short one. The most active Morgans--Gale, Duke, and the easy-going Satterlee--were indeed
wrought to the keenest pitch of revengeful anger. No question of the right or wrong of the
arrest was discussed--justification was not considered. It was an overwhelmingly insolent invasion--and
worst of all, a successful invasion, by one who had nothing but cool impudence, not even a
budding reputation to justify his assault on the lifelong prestige of the Gap clan. Gale Morgan
strode and rode the streets of Sleepy Cat looking for de Spain, and storming.

De Spain himself, somewhat surprised at the storm he had kicked up, heeded the counsel of Scott,
and while the acute stage of the resentment raged along the trail he ran down for a few days
to Medicine Bend to buy horses. Both Gale and Duke Morgan proclaimed, in certain public places
in Sleepy Cat, their intention of shooting de Spain on sight; and as a climax to all the excitement
of the week following his capture, the slippery Sassoon broke jail and, after a brief interval,
appeared at large in Calabasas.

This feat of the Morgan satellite made a loud laugh at de Spain's expense. It mitigated somewhat
the humiliation of Sassoon's friends, but it in no wise diminished their expressed resolve
to punish de Spain's invasion. Lefever, who as the mixer among the stage men, kept close to
the drift of public sentiment, decided after de Spain's return to Sleepy Cat that the stage-line
authorities had gained nothing by Sassoon's capture.

"We ought to have thought of it before, Henry," he said frankly one night in Jeffries's office,
"but we didn't think."

"Meaning just what, John?" demanded de Spain without real interest.

"Meaning, that in this country you can't begin on a play like pulling Sassoon out from under
his friends' noses without keeping up the pace--without a second and third act. You dragged
Sassoon by his hair out of the Gap; good. You surprised everybody; good. But you can't very
well stop at that, Henry. You have raised hopes, you have led people to invest you with the
faint glimmerings of a reputation. I say, the glimmerings, because such a feat by itself doesn't
insure a permanent reputation, Henry. It is, so to say, merely a 'demand' reputation--one that
men reserve the right to recall at any moment. And the worst of it is, if they ever do recall
it, you are worse off than when before they extended the brittle bauble to you."

"Jingo, John! For a stage blacksmith you are some spieler." De Spain added an impatient, not
to say contumelious exclamation concerning the substance of Lefever's talk. "I didn't ask them
for a reputation. This man interfered with my guard--in fact, tried to cut his throat, didn't he?"

"Would have done it if Frank had been an honest man."

"That is all there is to it, isn't it? If Sassoon or anybody else gets in the way of the stages,
I'll go after them again--that's all there is to it, isn't it?"

Lefever tapped the second finger of one fat hand gently on the table. "Practically; practically
all, Henry, yes. You don't quite understand, but you have the right idea. What I am trying
to hammer into your dense cocoanut is, that when a man has, gets, or is given a reputation
out in this country, he has got to live up to it."

"What do you want me to do--back a horse and shoot two guns at once up and down Main Street,
cowboy style?"

Lefever kept his patience without difficulty. "No, no. You'll understand."

"Scott advised me to run down to Medicine Bend for a few days to let the Morgans cool off."

"Right. That was the first step. The few days are a thing of the past. I suppose you know,"
continued Lefever, in as well-modulated a tone as he could assume to convey information that
could not be regarded as wholly cheerful, "that they expect to get you for this Sassoon job."

De Spain flushed. But the red anger lasted only a moment. "Who are 'they'?" he asked after a pause.

"Deaf Sandusky, Logan, of course, the Calabasas bunch, and the Morgans."

De Spain regarded his companion unamiably. "What do they expect I'll be doing while they are
getting me?"

Lefever raised a hand deprecatingly. "Don't be overconfident, Henry; that's your danger. I
know you can take care of yourself. All I want to do is to get the folks here acquainted with
your ability, without taking unnecessary chances. You see, people are not now asking questions
of one another; they are asking them of themselves. Who and what is this newcomer--an accident
or a genuine arrival? A common squib or a real explosion? Don't get excited," he added, in
an effort to soothe de Spain's obvious irritation. "You have the idea, Henry. It's time to
show yourself."

"I can't very well do business here without showing myself," retorted de Spain.

"But it is a thing to be managed," persisted Lefever. "Now, suppose--since the topic is up--we
'show' in Main Street for a while."

"Suppose we do," echoed de Spain ungraciously.

"That will crack the début ice. We will call at Harry Tenison's hotel, and then go to his new
rooms--go right to society headquarters first--that's my theory of doing it. If anybody has
any shooting in mind, Tenison's is a quiet and orderly place. And if a man declines to eat
anybody up at Tenison's, we put him down, Henry, as not ravenously hungry."

"One man I would like to see is that sheriff, Druel, who let Sassoon get out."

"Ready to interview him now?"

"I've got some telegrams to answer."

"Those will keep. The Morgans are in town. We'll start out and find somebody."

It was wet and sloppy outside, but Lefever was indifferent to the rain, and de Spain thought
it would be undignified to complain of it.

When, followed by Lefever, he walked into the lobby of Tenison's hotel a few moments later
the office was empty. Nevertheless, the news of the appearance of Sassoon's captor spread.
The two sauntered into the billiard-hall, which occupied a deep room adjoining the office and
opened with large plate-glass windows on Main Street. Every table was in use. A fringe of spectators
in the chairs, ostensibly watching the pool games, turned their eyes toward de Spain--those
that recognized him distinguishing him by nods and whispers to others.

Among several groups of men standing before the long bar, one party of four near the front
end likewise engaged the interest of those keener loafers who were capable of foreseeing situations.
These men, Satterlee Morgan, the cattleman; Bull Page, one of his cowboys; Sheriff Druel, and
Judge Druel, his brother, had been drinking together. They did not see Lefever and his companion
as the two came in through the rear lobby door. But Lefever, on catching sight of them, welcomed
his opportunity. Walking directly forward, he laid his hand on Satt Morgan's shoulder. As the
cattleman turned, Lefever, genially grasping his hand, introduced de Spain to each of the party
in turn. What followed in the brief interval between the meeting of the six men and the sudden
breaking up of the group a few moments later was never clearly known, but a fairly conclusive
theory of it was afterward accepted by Sleepy Cat.

Morgan threw the brim of his weather-beaten hat back from his tanned face. He wore a mustache
and a chin whisker of that variety designated in the mountains by the most opprobrious of epithets.
But his smile, which drew his cheeks into wrinkles all about his long, round nose, was not
unfriendly. He looked with open interest from his frank but not overtrustworthy eyes at de
Spain. "I heard," he said in a good-natured, slightly nasal tone, "you made a sunrise call
on us one day last week."

"And I want to say," returned de Spain, equally amiable, "that if I had had any idea you folks
would take it so hard--I mean, as an affront intended to any of you--I never would have gone
into the Gap after Sassoon. I just assumed--making a mistake as I now realize--that my scrap
would be with Sassoon, not with the Morgans."

Satt's face wrinkled into a humorous grin. "You sure kicked up some alkali."

De Spain nodded candidly. "More than I intended to. And I say--without any intention of impertinence
to anybody else--Sassoon is a cur. I supposed when I brought him in here after so much riding,
that we had sheriff enough to keep him." He looked at Druel with such composure that the latter
for a moment was nonplussed. Then he discharged a volley of oaths, and demanded what de Spain
meant. De Spain did not move. He refused to see the angry sheriff. "That is where I made my
second mistake," he continued, speaking to Morgan and forcing his tone just enough to be heard.
Druel, with more hard words, began to abuse the railroad for not paying taxes enough to build
a decent jail. De Spain took another tack. He eyed the sheriff calmly as the latter continued
to draw away and left de Spain standing somewhat apart from the rest of the group. "Then it
may be I am making another mistake, Druel, in blaming you. It may not be your fault."

"The fault is, you're fresh," cried Druel, warming up as de Spain appeared to cool. The line
of tipplers backed away from the bar. De Spain, stepping toward the sheriff, raised his hand
in a friendly way. "Druel, you're hurting yourself by your talk. Make me your deputy again
sometime," he concluded, "and I'll see that Sassoon stays where he is put."

"I'll just do that," cried Druel, with a very strong word, and he raised his hand in turn.
"Next time you want him locked up, you can take care of him yourself."

The sharp crack of a rifle cut off the words; a bullet tore like a lightning-bolt across de
Spain's neck, crashed through a mahogany pilaster back of the bar, and embedded itself in the
wall. The shot had been aimed from the street for his head. The noisy room instantly hushed.
Spectators sat glued to their chairs. White-faced players leaned motionless against the tables.
De Spain alone had acted; all that the bartenders could ever remember after the single rifle-shot
was seeing his hand go back as he whirled and shot instantly toward the heavy report. He had
whipped out his gun and fired sidewise through the window at the sound.

That was all. The bartenders breathed and looked again. Men were crowding like mad through
the back doors. De Spain, at the cigar case, looked intently into the rainy street, lighted
from the corner by a dingy lamp. The four men near him had not stirred, but, startled and alert,
the right hand of each covered the butt of a revolver. De Spain moved first. While the pool
players jammed the back doors to escape, he spoke to, without looking at, the bartender. "What's
the matter with your curtains?" he demanded, sheathing his revolver and pointing with an expletive
to the big sheet of plate glass. "Is this the way you build up business for the house?"

Those close enough to the window saw that the bare pane had been cut, just above the middle,
by two bullet-holes. Curious men examined both fractures when de Spain and Lefever had left
the saloon. The first hole was the larger. It had been made by a high-powered rifle; the second
was from a bullet of a Colt's revolver; it was remarked as a miracle of gun-play that the two
were hardly an inch apart.

In the street a few minutes later, de Spain and Lefever encountered Scott, who, with his back
hunched up, his cheap black hat pulled well down over his ears, his hands in his trousers pockets
and his thin coat collar modestly turned against the drizzling rain, was walking across the
parkway from the station.

"Sassoon is in town," exclaimed Lefever with certainty after he had told the story. He waited
for the Indian's opinion. Scott, looking through the water dripping from the brim of his seasoned
derby, gave it in one word. "Was," he amended with a quiet smile.

"Let's make sure," insisted Lefever. "Supposing he might be in town yet, Bob, where is he?"

Scott gazed up the street through the rain lighted by yellow lamps on the obscure corners,
and looked down the street toward the black reaches of the river. "If he's here, you'll find
him in one of two places. Tenison's----"

"But we've just come from Tenison's," objected Lefever.

"I mean, across the street, up-stairs; or at Jim Kitchen's barn. If he was hurried to get away,"
added Scott reflectively, "he would slip up-stairs over there as the nearest place to hide;
if he had time he would make for the barn, where it would be easy to cache his rifle."

Lefever took the lapel of the scout's coat in his hand. "Then you, Bob, go out and see if you
can get the whole story. I'll take the barn. Let Henry go over to Tenison's and wait at the
head of the stairs till we can get back there. It is just around the corner--second floor--a
dark hall running back, opposite the double doors that open into an anteroom. Stay there, Henry,
till we come. It won't be long, and if we don't get track of him you may spot your man yourself."

De Spain found no difficulty in locating the flight of marble stairs that led to the gambling-rooms.
It was the only lighted entrance in the side street. No light shone at the head of the stairs,
but a doorway on the left opened into a dimly lighted anteroom and this, in turn, through a
large arch, opened on a large room brilliantly lighted by chandeliers--one in the centre and
one near each corner. Around three sides of this room were placed the keno layouts, roulette-wheels,
faro-tables, and minor gambling devices. Off the casino itself small card-rooms opened.

The big room was well filled for a wet night. The faro-tables were busy, and at the central
table at the farther end of the room--the table designated as Tenison's, because, at the rare
intervals in which the proprietor dealt, he presided at this table--a group watched silently
a game in progress. De Spain took a place in shadow near one side of the archway facing the
street-door and at times looked within for the loosely jointed frame, crooked neck, tousled
forehead, and malevolent face of the cattle thief. He could find in the many figures scattered
about the room none resembling the one he sought.

A man entering the place spoke to another coming out. De Spain overheard the exchange. "Duke
got rid of his steers yet?" asked the first.

"Not yet."

"Slow game."

"The old man sold quite a bunch this time. The way he's playing now he'll last twenty-four hours."

De Spain, following the newcomer, strolled into the room and, beginning at one side, proceeded
in leisurely fashion from wheel to wheel and table to table inspecting the players. Few looked
at him and none paid any attention to his presence. At Tenison's table he saw in the dealer's
chair the large, white, smooth face, dark eyes, and clerical expression of the proprietor,
whose presence meant a real game and explained the interest of the idlers crowded about one
player whom de Spain, without getting closer in among the onlookers than he wanted to, could
not see.

Tenison, as de Spain approached, happened to look wearily up; his face showed the set lines
of a protracted session. He neither spoke nor nodded to the newcomer, but recognized him with
a mere glance. Then, though his eyes had rested for only an instant on the new face, he spoke
in an impassive tone across the intervening heads: "What happened to your red tie, Henry?"

De Spain put up his hand to his neck, and looked down at a loose end hanging from his soft
cravat. It had been torn by the bullet meant for his head. He tucked the end inside his collar.
"A Calabasas man tried to untie it a few minutes ago. He missed the knot."

Tenison did not hear the answer. He had reverted to his case. De Spain moved on and, after
making the round of the scattered tables, walked again through the archway into the anteroom,
only to meet, as she stood hesitating and apparently about to enter the room, Nan Morgan.

CHAPTER VIII

THE GAMBLING-ROOM

They confronted each other blankly. To Nan's confusion was added her embarrassment at her personal
appearance. Her hat was wet, and the limp shoulders of her khaki jacket and the front of her
silk blouse showed the wilting effect of the rain. In one hand she clutched wet riding-gloves.
Her cheeks, either from the cold rain or mental stress, fairly burned, and her eyes, which
had seemed when he encountered her, fired with some resolve, changed to an expression almost
of dismay.

This was hardly for more than an instant. Then her lips tightened, her eyes dropped, and she
took a step to one side to avoid de Spain and enter the gambling-room. He stepped in front
of her. She looked up, furious. "What do you mean?" she exclaimed with indignation. "Let me pass."

The sound of her voice restored his self-possession. He made no move to get out of her way,
indeed he rather pointedly continued to obstruct her. "You've made a mistake, I think," he
said evenly.

"I have not," she replied with resentment. "Let me pass."

"I think you have. You don't know where you are going," he persisted, his eyes bent uncompromisingly
on hers.

She showed increasing irritation at his attempt to exculpate her. "I know perfectly well where
I am going," she retorted with heat.

"Then you know," he returned steadily, "that you've no business to enter such a place."

His opposition seemed only to anger her. "I know where I have business. I need no admonitions
from you as to what places I enter. You are impertinent, insulting. Let me pass!"

His stubborn opposition showed no signs of weakening before her resolve. "One question," he
said, ignoring her angry words. "Have you ever been in these rooms before?"

He thought she quailed the least bit before his searching look. She even hesitated as to what
to say. But if her eyes fell momentarily it was only to collect herself. "Yes," she answered,
looking up unflinchingly.

Her resolute eyes supported her defiant word and openly challenged his interference, but he
met her once more quietly. "I am sorry to hear it," he rejoined. "But that won't make any difference.
You can't go in to-night."

"I will go in," she cried.

"No," he returned slowly, "you are not going in--not, at least, while I am here."

They stood immovable. He tried to reason her out of her determination. She resented every word
he offered. "You are most insolent," she exclaimed. "You are interfering in something that
is no concern of yours. You have no right to act in this outrageous way. If you don't stand
aside I'll call for help."

"Nan!" De Spain spoke her name suddenly and threateningly. His words fell fast, and he checked
her for an instant with his vehemence. "We met in the Gap a week ago. I said I was telling
you the exact truth. Did I do it?"

"I don't care what you said or what you did----"

"Answer me," he said sharply, "did I tell you the truth?"

"I don't know or care----"

"Yes, you do know----"

"What you say or do----"

"I told you the truth then, I am telling it now. I will never see you enter a gambling-room
as long as I can prevent it. Call for help if you like."

She looked at him with amazement. She seemed about to speak--to make another protest. Instead,
she turned suddenly away, hesitated again, put both her hands to her face, burst into tears,
and hurried toward the stairs. De Spain followed her. "Let me take you to where you are going?"

Nan turned on him, her eyes blazing through her tears, with a single, scornful, furious word:
"No!" She quickened her step from him in such confusion that she ran into two men just reaching
the top of the stairs. They separated with alacrity, and gave her passage. One of the men was
Lefever, who, despite his size, was extremely nimble in getting out of her urgent way, and
quick in lifting his hat. She fairly raced down the flight of steps, leaving Lefever looking
after her in astonishment. He turned to de Spain: "Now, who the deuce was that?"

De Spain ignored his question by asking another: "Did you find him?" Lefever shook his head.
"Not a trace; I covered Main Street. I guess Bob was right. Nobody home here, Henry?"

"Nobody we want."

"Nothing going on?"

"Not a thing. If you will wait here for Bob, I'll run over to the office and answer those telegrams."

De Spain started for the stairs. "Henry," called Lefever, as his companion trotted hastily
down, "if you catch up to her, kindly apologize for a fat man."

But de Spain was balked of an opportunity to follow Nan. In the street he ran into Scott. "Did
you get the story?" demanded de Spain.

"Part of it."

"Was it Sassoon?"

Scott shook his head. "I wish it was."

"What do you mean?"

"Deaf Sandusky."

"Calabasas?"

Scott nodded. "You must have moved a couple of inches at the right nick, Henry. That man Sandusky,"
Bob smiled a sickly smile, "doesn't miss very often. He was bothered a little by his friends
being all around you."

The two regarded each other for a moment in silence. "Why," asked de Spain, boiling a little,
"should that damned, hulking brute try to blow my head off just now?"

"Only for the good of the order, Henry," grinned the scout.

"Nice job Jeff has picked out for me," muttered de Spain grimly, "standing up in these Sleepy
Cat barrooms to be shot at." He drew in a good breath and threw up the wet brim of his hat.
"Well, such is life in the high country, I suppose. Some fine day Mr. Sandusky will manage
to get me--or I'll manage to get him--that all depends on how the happening happens. Anyway,
Bob, it's bad luck to miss a man. We'll hang that much of a handicap on his beef-eating crop.
Is he the fellow John calls the butcher?" demanded de Spain.

"That's what everybody calls him, I guess."

The two rejoined Lefever at the head of the stairs and the three discussed the news. Even Lefever
seemed more serious when he heard the report. Scott, when asked where Sandusky now was, nodded
toward the big room in front of them.

Lefever looked toward the gambling-tables. "We'll go in and look at him." He turned to Scott
to invite his comment on the proposal. "Think twice, John," suggested the Indian. "If there's
any trouble in a crowd like that, somebody that has no interest in de Spain or Sandusky is
pretty sure to get hurt."

"I don't mean to start anything," explained Lefever. "I only want de Spain to look at him."

But sometimes things start themselves. Lefever found Sandusky at a faro-table. At his side
sat his partner, Logan. Three other players, together with the onlookers, and the dealer--whose
tumbled hair fell partly over the visor that protected his eyes from the glare of the overhead
light--made up the group. The table stood next to that of Tenison, who, white-faced and impassive
under the heat and light, still held to his chair.

Lefever took a position at one end of the table, where he faced Sandusky, and de Spain, just
behind his shoulder, had a chance to look the two Calabasas men closely over. Sandusky again
impressed him as a powerful man, who, beyond an ample stomach, carried his weight without showing
it. What de Spain most noted, as it lay on the table, was the size and extreme length of the
outlaw's hand. He had heard of Sandusky's hand. From the tips of the big fingers to the base
of the palm, this right hand, spread over his chips, would cover half again the length of the
hand of the average man.

De Spain credited readily the extraordinary stories he had heard of Sandusky's dexterity with
a revolver or a rifle. That he should so lately have missed a shot at so close range was partly
explained now that de Spain perceived Sandusky's small, hard, brown eyes were somewhat unnaturally
bright, and that his brows knit every little while in his effort to collect himself. But his
stimulation only partly explained the failure; it was notoriously hard to upset the powerful
outlaw with alcohol. De Spain noted the coarse, straw-colored hair--plastered recently over
the forehead by a barber--the heavy, sandy mustache, freshly waxed by the same hand, the bellicose
nostrils of the Roman nose, the broad, split chin, and mean, deep lines of a most unpromising
face. Sandusky's brown shirt sprawled open at the collar, and de Spain remembered again the
flashy waistcoat, fastened at the last buttonhole by a cut-glass button.

At Sandusky's side sat his crony in all important undertakings--a much smaller, sparer man,
with aggressive shoulders and restless eyes. Logan was the lookout of the pair, and his roving
glance lighted on de Spain before the latter had inspected him more than a moment. He lost
no time in beginning on de Spain with an insolent question as to what he was looking at. De
Spain, his eye bent steadily on him, answered with a tone neither of apology nor pronounced
offense: "I am looking at you."

Lefever hitched at his trousers cheerily and, stepping away from de Spain, took a position
just behind the dealer. "What are you looking at me for?" demanded Logan insolently.

De Spain raised his voice to match exactly the tone of the inquiry. "So I'll know you next time."

Logan pushed back his chair. As he turned his legs from under the table to rise, a hand rested
on his shoulder. He looked up and saw the brown face and feeble smile of Scott. Logan with
his nearest foot kicked Sandusky. The big fellow looked up and around. Either by chance or
in following the sound of the last voice, his glance fell on de Spain. He scrutinized for a
suspicious instant the burning eyes and the red mark low on the cheek. While he did so--comprehension
dawning on him--his enormous hands, forsaking the pile of chips with which both had been for
a moment busy, flattened out, palms down, on the faro-table. Logan tried to rise. Scott's hand
rested heavily on him. "What's the row?" demanded Sandusky in the queer tone of a deaf man.
Logan pointed at de Spain. "That Medicine Bend duck wants a fight."

"With a man, Logan; not with a cub," retorted de Spain, matching insult with insult.

"Maybe I can do something for you," interposed Sandusky. His eyes ran like a flash around the
table. He saw how Lefever had pre-empted the best place in the room. He looked up and back
at the man standing now at his shoulder, and almost between Logan and himself. It was the Indian,
Scott. Sandusky felt, as his faculties cleared and arranged themselves every instant, that
there was no hurry whatever about lifting his hand; but he could not be faced down without
a show of resistance, and he concluded that for this occasion his tongue was the best weapon.
"If I can," he added stiffly, "I'm at your service."

De Spain made no answer beyond keeping his eyes well on Sandusky's eyes. Tenison, overhearing
the last words, awoke to the situation and rose from his case. He made his way through the
crowd around the disputants and brusquely directed the dealer to close the game. While Sandusky
was cashing in, Tenison took Logan aside. What Tenison said was not audible, but it sufficed
to quiet the little fellow. The only thing further to be settled was as to who should leave
the room last, since neither party was willing to go first. Tenison, after a formal conference
with Lefever and Logan, offered to take Sandusky and Logan by a private stairway to the billiard-room,
while Lefever took de Spain and Scott out by way of the main entrance. This was arranged, and
when the railroad men reached the street rain had ceased falling.

Scott warned de Spain to keep within doors, and de Spain promised to do so. But when they left
him he started out at once to see whether he could not, by some happy chance, encounter Nan.

CHAPTER IX

A CUP OF COFFEE

He was willing, after a long and bootless search, to confess to himself that he would rather
see Nan Morgan for one minute than all women else in the world for a lifetime. The other incidents
of the evening would have given any ordinary man enough food for reflection--indeed they did
force de Spain to realize that his life would hang by a slender thread while he remained at
Sleepy Cat and continued to brave the rulers of the Sinks.

But this danger, which after all was a portion of his responsibility in freeing his stages
from the depredations of the Calabasas gang, failed to make on him the moving impression of
one moment of Nan Morgan's eyes. She could upset him completely, he was forced to admit, by
a glance, a word, a gesture--a mere turn of her head. There was in the whole world nothing
he wanted to do so much as in some way to please her--yet it seemed his ill luck to get continually
deeper into her bad graces. It had so stunned and angered him to meet her intent on entering
a gambling-hall that he was tormented the whole night. Association with outlaws--what might
it not do for even such a girl? While her people were not all equally reprobate, some of them
at least were not far better than the criminals of Calabasas. To conceive of her gambling publicly
in Sleepy Cat was too much. He had even taken a horse, after cautiously but persistently haunting
the streets for an hour, and ridden across the river away out on the mountain trail, hoping
to catch a sight of her.

On his way back to town from this wild-goose chase, he heard the sound of hoofs. He was nearing
the river and he turned his horse into a clump of trees beside the bridge. The night was very
dark, but he was close to the trail and had made up his mind to speak to Nan if it were she.
In another moment his ear told him there were two horses approaching. He waited for the couple
to cross the bridge, and they passed him so close he could almost have touched the nearer rider.
Then he realized, as the horse passing beside him shied, that it was Sandusky and Logan riding
silently by.

For a week de Spain spent most of his time in Sleepy Cat trying to catch sight of Nan. His
reflection on the untoward incidents that had set them at variance left him rebellious. He
meditated more about putting himself right with her than about all his remaining concerns together.
A strange fire had seized him--that fire of the imagination which scorns fair words and fine
reasoning, but which, smothered, burns in secret until, fanned by the wind of accident, it
bursts out the more fiercely because of the depths in which it has smouldered.

Every day that de Spain rode across the open country, his eyes turned to the far range and
to Music Mountain. The rounded, distant, immutable peak--majestic as the sun, cold as the stars,
shrouding in its unknown fastnesses the mysteries of the ages and the secrets of time--meant
to him now only this mountain girl whom its solitude sheltered and to whom his thoughts continually
came back.

Within two weeks he became desperate. He rode the Gap trail from Sleepy Cat again and again
for miles and miles in the effort to encounter her. He came to know every ridge and hollow
on it, every patch and stone between the lava beds and the Rat River. And in spite of the counsels
of his associates, who warned him to beware of traps, he spent, under one pretext or another,
much of the time either on the stages to and from Calabasas or in the saddle toward Morgan's
Gap, looking for Nan.

Killing time in this way, after a fruitless ride, his persistence was one day most unexpectedly
rewarded at the Calabasas barns. He had ridden through a hot sun from Sleepy Cat, passing the
up stage half-way to Calabasas, and had struck from there directly out on the Sinks toward
Morgan's Gap. Riding thence around the lower lava beds, he had headed for Calabasas, where
he had an appointment to meet Scott and Lefever at five o'clock. When de Spain reached the
Calabasas barn, McAlpin, the barn boss, was standing in the doorway. "You'd never be comin'
from Sleepy Cat in the saddle!" exclaimed McAlpin incredulously. De Spain nodded affirmatively
as he dismounted. "Hot ride, sir; a hot day," commented McAlpin, shaking his head dubiously
as he called a man to take the horse, unstrapped de Spain's coat from the saddle, and followed
the manager into the office.

The heat was oppressive, and de Spain unbuckled his cartridge-belt, slipped his revolver from
the holster, mechanically stuck it inside his trousers waistband, hung the heavy belt up under
his coat, and, sitting down, called for the stage report and asked whether the new blacksmith
had sobered up. When McAlpin had given him all minor information called for, de Spain walked
with him out into the barn to inspect the horses. Passing the very last of the box-stalls,
the manager saw in it a pony. He stopped. No second glance was needed to tell him it was a
good horse; then he realized that this wiry, sleek-legged roan, contentedly munching at the
moment some company hay, was Nan Morgan's.

McAlpin, talking volubly, essayed to move on, but de Spain, stubbornly pausing, only continued
to look at the handsome saddle-horse. McAlpin saw he was in for it, and resigned himself to
an inquisition. When de Spain asked whose horse it was, McAlpin was ready. "That little pony
is Nan Morgan's, sir."

De Spain made no comment. "Good-looking pony, sir," ventured McAlpin half-heartedly.

"What's it doing here?" demanded de Spain coldly.

Before answering, the barn boss eyed de Spain very carefully to see how the wind was setting,
for the pony's presence confessed an infraction of a very particular rule. "You see," he began,
cocking at his strict boss from below his visorless cap a questioning Scotch eye, "I like to
keep on good terms with that gang. Some of them can be very ugly. It's better to be friends
with them when you can--by stretching the barn rules a little once in a while--than to have
enemies of 'em all the time--don't you think so, sir?"

"What's her horse doing here?" asked de Spain, without commenting on the long story, but also
without showing, as far as the barnman could detect, any growing resentment at the infraction
of his regulations.

McAlpin made even the most inconsequential approaches to a statement with a keen and questioning
glance. "The girl went up to the Cat on the early stage, sir. She's coming back this afternoon."

"What is she riding away over here to Calabasas for to take the stage, instead of riding straight
into Sleepy Cat?"

Once more McAlpin eyed him carefully. "The girl's been sick."

"Sick?"

"She ain't really fit to ride a step," confided the Scotch boss with growing confidence. "But
she's been going up two or three times now to get some medicine from Doc Torpy--that's the
way of it. There's a nice girl, sir--in a bunch o' ruffians, I know--though old Duke, she lives
with, he ain't a half-bad man except for too many cards; I used to work for him--but I call
her a nice girl. Do you happen to know her?"

De Spain had long been on guard. "I've spoken with her in a business way one or twice, Jim.
I can't really say I know her."

"Nice girl. But that's a tough bunch in that Gap, sure as you're alive; yes, sir."

De Spain was well aware the canny boss ought to know. McAlpin had lived at one time in the
Gap, and was himself reputed to have been a hardy and enduring rider on a night round-up.

"Anything sick, Jim?" asked de Spain, walking on down the barn and looking at the horses. It
was only the second time since he had given him the job that de Spain had called the barn boss
"Jim," and McAlpin answered with the rising assurance of one who realizes he is "in" right.
"Not so much as a sore hoof in either alley, Mr. de Spain. I try to take care of them, sir."

"What are we paying you, Jim?"

"Twenty-seven a week, sir; pretty heavy work at that."

"We'll try to make that thirty-two after this week."

McAlpin touched his cap. "Thank you kindly, sir, I'm sure. It costs like hell to live out here,
Mr. de Spain."

"Lefever says you live off him at poker."

"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, sir! John will have his joke. He's always after me to play poker with him--I
don't like to do it. I've got a family to support--he ain't. But by and far, I don't think
John and me is ten dollars apart, year in and year out. Look at that bay, sir! A month ago
Elpaso said that horse was all in--look at him now. I manage to keep things up."

"What did you say," asked de Spain indifferently, "had been the matter with Nan Morgan?" Her
name seemed a whole mouthful to speak, so fearful was he of betraying interest.

"Why, I really didn't say, sir. And I don't know. But from what she says, and the way she coughs,
I'm thinking it was a touch of this p-new-monia that's going around so much lately, sir."

His listener recalled swiftly the days that had passed since the night he had seen her wet
through in the cold rain at Sleepy Cat. He feared Jim's diagnosis might be right. And he had
already made all arrangements to meet the occasion now presenting itself. Circumstances seemed
at last to favor him, and he looked at his watch. The down stage bringing Nan back would be
due in less than an hour.

"Jim," he said thoughtfully, "you are doing the right thing in showing some good-will toward
the Morgans."

"Now, I'm glad you think that, sir."

"You know I unintentionally rubbed their backs the wrong way in dragging Sassoon out."

"They're jealous of their power, I know--very jealous."

"This seems the chance to show that I have no real animosity myself toward the outfit."

Since de Spain was not looking at him, McAlpin cocked two keen and curious eyes on the sphinx-like
birthmark of the very amiable speaker's face. However, the astute boss, if he wondered, made
no comment. "When the stage comes in," continued de Spain quietly, "have the two grays--Lady
and Ben--hitched to my own light Studebaker. I'll drive her over to the Gap myself."

"The very thing," exclaimed McAlpin, staring and struggling with his breath.

"In some way I've happened, both times I talked with her, to get in wrong--understand?" McAlpin,
with clearing wits, nodded more than once. "No fault of mine; it just happened so. And she
may not at first take kindly to the idea of going with me."

"I see."

"But she ought to do it. She will be tired--it's a long, dusty ride for a well woman, let alone
one that has been ill."

"So it is, so it is!"

De Spain looked now shamelessly at his ready-witted aid. "See that her pony is lame when she
gets here--can't be ridden. But you'll take good care of him and send him home in a few days--get
it?"

McAlpin half closed his eyes. "He'll be so lame it would stagger a cowboy to back him ten feet--and
never be hurt a mite, neither. Trust me!"

"No other horse that she could ride, in the barn?"

"No horse she could ride between Calabasas and Thief River."

"If she insists on riding something, or even walking home," continued de Spain dubiously, for
he felt instinctively that he should have the task of his life to induce Nan to accept any
kind of a peace-offering, "I'll ride or walk with her anyway. Can you sleep me here to-night,
on the hay?"

"Sleep you on a hair mattress, sir. You've got a room right here up-stairs, didn't you know that?"

"Don't mind the bed," directed de Spain prudently. "I like the hay better."

"As you like; we've got plenty of it fresh up-stairs, from the Gap. But the bed's all right,
sir; it is, on me word."

With arrangements so begun, de Spain walked out-of-doors and looked reflectively up the Sleepy
Cat road. One further refinement in his appeal for Nan's favor suggested itself. She would
be hungry, possibly faint in the heat and dust, when she arrived. He returned to McAlpin: "Where
can I get a good cup of coffee when the stage comes in?"

"Go right down to the inn, sir. It's a new chap running it--a half-witted man from Texas. My
wife is cooking there off and on. She'll fix you up a sandwich and a cup of good coffee."

It was four o'clock, and the sun beat fiercely on the desert. De Spain walked down to the inn
unmindful of the heat. In summer rig, with his soft-shirt collar turned under, his forearms
bare, and his thoughts engaged, he made his way rapidly on, looking neither to the right nor
the left.

As he approached the weather-beaten pile it looked no more inviting in sunshine than it had
looked in shadow; and true to its traditions, not a living being was anywhere to be seen. The
door of the office stood ajar. De Spain, pushing it all the way open, walked in. No one greeted
him as he crossed the threshold, and the unsightly room was still bare of furnishings except
for the great mahogany bar, with its two very large broken mirrors and the battered pilasters
and carvings.

De Spain pounded on the bar. His effort to attract attention met with no response. He walked
to the left end of the bar, lifted the hand-rail that enclosed the space behind it, and pushed
open the door between the mirrors leading to the back room. This, too, was empty. He called
out--there was no response. He walked through a second door opening on an arcaded passageway
toward the kitchen--not a soul was in sight. There was a low fire in the kitchen stove, but
Mrs. McAlpin had apparently gone home for a while. Walking back toward the office, he remembered
the covered way leading to a patio, which in turn opened on the main road. He perceived also
that at the end next the office the covered way faced the window at the end of the long bar.

Irritated at the desertion of the place, due, he afterward learned, to the heat of the afternoon,
and disappointed at the frustration of his purpose, he walked back through the rear room into
the office. As he lifted the hand-rail and, passing through, lowered it behind him, he took
out his watch to see how soon the stage was due. While he held the timepiece in his hand he
heard a rapid clatter of hoofs approaching the place. Thinking it might be Scott and Lefever
arriving from the south an hour ahead of time, he started toward the front door--which was
still open--to greet them. Outside, hurried footsteps reached the door just ahead of him and
a large man, stepping quickly into the room, confronted de Spain. One of the man's hands rested
lightly on his right side. De Spain recognized him instantly; the small, drooping head, carried
well forward, the keen eyes, the long hand, and, had there still been a question in his mind,
the loud-patterned, shabby waistcoat would have proclaimed beyond doubt--Deaf Sandusky.

CHAPTER X

THE GLASS BUTTON

Even as the big fellow stepped lightly just inside and to the left--as de Spain stood--of the
door and faced him, the encounter seemed to de Spain accidental. While Sandusky was not a man
he would have chosen to meet at that time, he did not at first consider the incident an eventful
one. But before he could speak, a second man appeared in the doorway, and this man appeared
to be joking with a third, behind him. As the second man crossed the threshold, de Spain saw
Sandusky's high-voiced little fighting crony, Logan, who now made way, as he stepped within
to the right of the open door, for the swinging shoulders and rolling stride of Gale Morgan.

Morgan, eying de Spain with insolence, as was his wont, closed the door behind him with a bang.
Then he backed his powerful frame significantly against it.

A blind man could have seen the completeness of the snare. An unpleasant feeling flashed across
de Spain's perception. It was only for the immeasurable part of a second--while uncertainty
was resolving itself into a rapid certainty. When Gale Morgan stepped into the room on the
heels of his two Calabasas friends, de Spain would have sold for less than a cup of coffee
all his chances for life. Nevertheless, before Morgan had set his back fairly against the door
and the trap was sprung, de Spain had mapped his fight, and had already felt that, although
he might not be the fortunate man, not more than one of the four within the room would be likely
to leave it alive.

He did not retreat from where he halted at the instant Sandusky entered. His one slender chance
was to hug to the men that meant to kill him. Morgan, the nearest, he esteemed the least dangerous
of the three; but to think to escape both Sandusky and Logan at close quarters was, he knew,
more than ought to be hoped for.

While Morgan was closing the door, de Spain smiled at his visitors: "That isn't necessary,
Morgan: I'm not ready to run." Morgan only continued to stare at him. "I need hardly ask,"
added de Spain, "whether you fellows have business with me?"

He looked to Sandusky for a reply; it was Logan who answered in shrill falsetto: "No. We don't
happen to have business that I know of. A friend of ours may have a little, maybe!" Logan,
lifting his shoulders with his laugh, looked toward his companions for an answer to his joke.

De Spain's smile appeared unruffled: "You'll help him transact it, I suppose?"

Logan, looking again toward Sandusky, grinned: "He won't need any help."

"Who is your friend?" demanded de Spain good-naturedly. Logan's glance misled him; it did not
refer to Sandusky. And even as he asked the question de Spain heard through the half-open window
at the end of the bar the sound of hoofs. Hoping against hope for Lefever, the interruption
cheered him. It certainly did not seem that his situation could be made worse.

"Well," answered Logan, talking again to his gallery of cronies, "we've got two or three friends
that want to see you. They're waiting outside to see what you'll look like in about five minutes--ain't
they, Gale?"

Some one was moving within the rear room. De Spain felt hope in every footfall he heard, and
the mention this time of Morgan's name cleared his plan of battle. Before Gale, with an oath,
could blurt out his answer, de Spain had resolved to fight where he stood, taking Logan first
and Morgan as he should jump in between the two. It was at the best a hopeless venture against
Sandusky's first shot, which de Spain knew was almost sure to reach a vital spot. But desperate
men cannot be choosers.

"There's no time for seeing me like the present," declared de Spain, ignoring Morgan and addressing
his words to Logan. "Bring your friends in. What are you complaining about, Morgan?" he asked,
resenting the stream of abuse that Gale hurled at him whenever he could get a word in. "I had
my turn at you with a rifle the other day. You've got your turn now. And I call it a pretty
soft one, too--don't you, Sandusky?" he demanded suddenly of the big fellow.

Sandusky alone through the talk had kept an unbroken silence. He was eating up de Spain with
his eyes, and de Spain not only ached to hear him speak but was resolved to make him. Sandusky
had stood motionless from the instant he entered the room. He knew all about the preliminary
gabble of a fight and took no interest in it. He did not know all about de Spain, and being
about to face his bullets he had prudence enough to wonder whether the man could have brought
a reputation to Sleepy Cat without having done something to earn it. What Sandusky was sensibly
intent on was the determination that he should not contribute personally to the further upbuilding
of anybody's reputation. His eyes with this resolve shining in them rested intently on de Spain,
and at his side the long fingers of his right hand beat a soft tattoo against his pistol holster.
De Spain's question seemed to arouse him. "What's your name?" he demanded bluntly. His voice
was heavy and his deafness was reflected in the strained tone.

"It's on the butt of my gun, Sandusky."

"What's that he says?" demanded the man known as the butcher, asking the question of Logan,
but without taking his eyes off his shifty prey.

Logan raised his voice to repeat the words and to add a ribald comment.

"You make a good deal of noise," muttered Sandusky, speaking again to de Spain.

"That ought not to bother you much, Sandusky," shouted de Spain, trying to win a smile from
his taciturn antagonist.

"His noise won't bother anybody much longer," put in Logan, whose retorts overflowed at every
interval. But there was no smile even hinted at in the uncompromising vigilance of Sandusky's
expressionless face. De Spain discounted the next few minutes far enough to feel that Sandusky's
first shot would mean death to him, even if he could return it.

"I'll tell you, de Spain," continued Logan, "we're going to have a drink with you. Then we're
going to prepare you for going back where you come from--with nice flowers."

"I guess you thought you could come out here and run over everybody in the Spanish Sinks,"
interposed Morgan, with every oath he could summon to load his words.

"Keep out, Morgan," exclaimed Logan testily. "I'll do this talking."

De Spain continued to banter. "Gentlemen," he said, addressing the three together and realizing
that every moment wasted before the shooting added a grain of hope, "I am ready to drink when
you are."

"He's ready to drink, Tom," roared Morgan in the deaf man's ear.

"I'm ready," announced Sandusky in hollow voice.

Still regarding de Spain with the most businesslike expression, the grizzled outlaw took a
guarded step forward, his companions following suit. De Spain, always with a jealous regard
for the relative distance between him and his self-appointed executioners, moved backward.
In crossing the room, Sandusky, without objection from his companions, moved across their front,
and when the four lined up at the bar their positions had changed. De Spain stood at the extreme
left, Sandusky next, Logan beside him, and Gale Morgan, at the other end of the line, pretended
to pound the bar for service. De Spain, following mountain etiquette in the circumstances,
spread his open hands, palms down, on the bar. Sandusky's great palms slid in the same fashion
over the checked slab in unspoken recognition of the brief armistice. Logan's hands came up
in turn, and Morgan still pounded for some one to serve.

De Spain in the new disposition weighed his chances as being both better and worse. They had
put Sandusky's first shot at no more than an arm's length from his prey, with Logan next to
cover the possibility of the big fellow's failing to paralyze de Spain the first instant. On
the other hand, de Spain, trained in the tactics of Whispering Smith and Medicine Bend gunmen,
welcomed a short-arm struggle with the worst of his assailants closest at hand. One factor,
too, that he realized they were reckoning with, gave him no concern. No men in the mountains
understood better or were more expert in the technicalities of the law of self-defense than
the gunmen of Calabasas. The killing of de Spain they well knew would, in spite of everything,
raise a hornet's nest in Sleepy Cat, and they wished to be prepared for it. Their manoeuvring
on this score caused no disquiet to their slender, compactly built victim. "You'll wait a long
time, if you wait for service here, Morgan," he said, commenting with composure on Morgan's
impatience. Logan looked again at his two companions and laughed.

Every hope de Spain had of possible help from the back room died with that laugh. Then the
door behind the bar slowly opened, and the scar-featured face of Sassoon peered cautiously
from the gloom. The horse thief, stooping, walked in with a leer directed triumphantly at the
railroad man.

If it were possible to deepen it, the sinister spot on de Spain's face darkened. Something
in his blood raged at the sight of the malevolent face. He glanced at Logan. "This," he smiled
faintly, nodding toward Sassoon as he himself took a short step farther to the left, "is your
drink, Harvey, is it?"

"No," retorted Logan loudly, "this is your drink."

"I'll take Sassoon," assented de Spain, good-natured again and shifting still another step
to the left. "What do you fellows want now?"

"We want to punch a hole through that strawberry," said Logan, "that beauty-mark. Where did
you get it, de Spain?"

"I might as well ask where you get your gall, Harvey," returned de Spain, watching Logan hunch
Sandusky toward the left that both might crowd him closer. "I was born with my beauty-mark--just
as you were born with your damned bad manners," he added composedly, for in hugging up to him
his enemies were playing his game. "You can't help it, neither can I," he went on. "Somebody
is bound to pay for putting that mark on me. Somebody is bound to pay for your manners. Why
talk about either? Sassoon, set out for your friends--or I will. Spread, gentlemen, spread."

He had reached the position on which he believed his life depended, and stood so close to the
end of the bar that with a single step, as he uttered the last words, he turned it. Sandusky
pushed close next him. De Spain continued to speak without hesitation or break, but the words
seemed to have no place in his mind. He was thinking only, and saw only within his field of
vision, a cut-glass button that fastened the bottom of Sandusky's greased waistcoat.

"You've waited one day too long to collect for your strawberry, de Spain," cried Logan shrilly.
"You've turned one trick too many on the Sinks, young fellow. If the man that put your mark
on you ain't in this room, you'll never get him."

"Which means, I take it, you're going to try to get me," smiled de Spain.

"No," bellowed Morgan, "it means we have got you."

"You are fooling yourself, Harvey." De Spain addressed the warning to Logan. "And you, too,
Sandusky," he added.

"We'll take care of that," grinned Logan. Sandusky kept silence.

"You are jumping into another man's fight," protested de Spain steadily.

"Sassoon's fight is our fight," interrupted Morgan.

"I advise you," said de Spain once more, looking with the words at Sandusky and his crony,
"to keep out of it."

"Sandusky," yelled Logan to his partner, "he advises me and you to keep out of this fight,"
he shrilly laughed.

"Sure," assented Sandusky, but with no variation in tone and his eyes on de Spain.

Logan, with an oath, leaned over the bar toward Sassoon, and pointed contemptuously toward
the end of the bar. "Shike!" he cried, "step through the rail and take that man's gun."

De Spain, looking from one to the other of the four faces confronting him, laughed for the
first time. But he was looking without seeing what he seemed to look at. In reality, he saw
only a cut-glass button. He was face to face with taking a man's life or surrendering his own,
and he knew the life must be taken in such a way as instantly to disable its possessor. These
men had chosen their time and place. There was nothing for it but to meet them. Sassoon was
stepping toward him, though very doubtfully. De Spain laughed again, dryly this time. "Go slow,
Sassoon," he said. "That gun is loaded."

"If you want terms, hand over your gun to Sassoon," cried Logan.

"Not till it's empty," returned de Spain. "Do you want to try taking it?" he demanded of Logan,
his cheeks burning a little darker.

Logan never answered the question. It was not meant to be answered. For de Spain asked it only
to cover the spring he made at that instant into Sandusky's middle. Catlike though it was,
the feint did not take the big fellow unprepared. He had heard once, when or where he could
not tell, but he had never forgotten the hint, that de Spain, a boxer, was as quick with his
feet as with his hands. The outlaw whirled. Both men shot from the hip; the reports cracked
together. One bullet grazing the fancy button smashed through the gaudy waistcoat: the other,
as de Spain's free hand struck at the muzzle of the big man's gun, tore into de Spain's foot.
Sandusky, convulsed by the frightful shock, staggered against de Spain's arm, the latter dancing
tight against him. Logan, alive to the trick but caught behind his partner, fired over Sandusky's
right shoulder at de Spain's head, flattened sidewise against the gasping outlaw's breast.
Logan, sinking to the floor, never moved again. Supporting with extraordinary strength the
unwieldy bulk of the dying butcher, de Spain managed to steady him as a buffer against Morgan's
fire until he could send a slug over Sandusky's head at the instant the latter collapsed. Morgan
fell against the bar.

Sandusky's weight dragged de Spain down. For an instant the four men sprawled in a heap. Sassoon,
who had not yet got an effective shot across at his agile enemy, dropping his revolver, dodged
under the rail to close. De Spain, struggling to free himself from the dying man, saw, through
a mist, the greenish eyes and the thirsty knife. He fired from the floor. The bullet shook
without stopping his enemy, and de Spain, partly caught under Sandusky's body, thought, as
Sassoon came on, the game was up. With an effort born of desperation, he dragged himself from
under the twitching giant, freed his revolver, rolled away, and, with his sight swimming, swung
the gun at Sassoon's stomach. He meant to kill him. The bullet whirled the white-faced man
to one side and he dropped, but pulled himself, full of fight, to his knees and, knife in hand,
panted forward. De Spain rolling hastily from him, staggered to his feet and, running in as
Sassoon tried to strike, beat him senseless with the butt of his gun.

His own eyes were streaming blood. His head was reeling and he was breathless, but he remembered
those of the gang waiting outside. He still could see dimly the window at the end of the bar.
Dashing his fingers through the red stream on his forehead, he ran for the window, smashed
through the sash into the patio and found Sassoon's horse trembling at the fusillade. Catching
the lines and the pommel, he stuck his foot up again and again for the stirrup. It was useless;
he could not make it. Then, summoning all of his fast-ebbing strength, he threw himself like
a sack across the horse's back, lashed the brute through the open gateway, climbed into the
saddle, and spurred blindly away.

CHAPTER XI

AFTER THE STORM

It was well along toward midnight of the same day when two horsemen, after having ridden circumspectly
around the outbuildings and corrals, dismounted from their horses at some little distance from
the door of the Calabasas Inn. They shook out their legs as men do after a long turn in the
saddle and faced each other in a whispered colloquy. An overcast sky, darkening the night,
concealed the alkali crusting the riders and their horses; but the hard breathing of the latter
in the darkness told of a pace forced for some hours.

"Find your feet before you go in, Pardaloe," suggested the heavier of the two men guardedly
to the taller one.

the fixed as there as those writing is examined by smashing and civil
person.

 Lefever in the background, nothing disturbed, threw
a flash-light back at the half-dressed innkeeper. His hair was tumbled sleepily across his
forehead and his eyes--one showing a white scar across the pupil--set deep in retreating orbits,
blinked under heavy brows. "What do you want?" he demanded. Pardaloe, without answering, pushed
through the half-open door into the room.

"We're staying here to-night," announced Pardaloe, as simply as possible. Lefever had already
edged into the doorway, pushing the stubborn innkeeper aside by sheer bulk of weight and size.

The sleepy man gave ground stubbornly. "I've got no beds," he growled surlily. "You can't stay
here."

Lefever at once assumed the case for the intruders. "I could sleep this minute standing on
my head," he declared. "And as for staying here, I can't stay anywhere else. What's your name,
son?" he demanded, buttonholing in his off-hand way the protesting man.

"My name is Philippi," answered the one-eyed defiantly.

"Regards to Brutus, my dear fellow," retorted Lefever, seizing the man's hand as if happily
surprised.

"You can't crowd in here, so you might as well move on," declared Philippi gruffly. "This is
no hotel."

Lefever laughed. "No offense, Philippi, but would it be indiscreet to ask which side of your
face hurts the most when you smile?"

"If you've got no beds, we won't bother you long," interposed Pardaloe.

"I'd like a pitcher of ice-water, anyway," persisted Lefever. "Sit down, noble Greek; we'll
talk this over."

"Who are you fellows?" demanded Philippi, looking from one to the other.

"I am a prospector from the Purgatoire," answered Pardaloe.

Philippi turned his keen eye on Lefever. "You a railroad man?"

"No, sir," declared Lefever, dusting the alkali vigorously from his coat sleeve.

"What are you?"

John looked as modest as it was possible for him to look. "Few people ask me that, but in matter
of fact I am an objet d'art."

"What's that?"

"Different things at different times to different men, Philippi," answered Lefever simply,
exploring, while he spoke, different corners of the room with his flash-light. "At this moment--"
he stopped suddenly, then resumed reassuringly--"I want a drink."

"Nothing doing," muttered the landlord sulkily.

Lefever's flash-light focussed on a United States license hanging back of the bar. "Is that
a mere frame-up, Philippi?" he demanded, walking significantly toward the vender's authority.

"Nothing in the house to-night."

"Then," announced Lefever calmly, "I arrest you."

Philippi started. "Arrest me?"

"For obtaining a thirst under false pretenses. Come, now, before we slip the irons on, get
us something to eat. I'll go up-stairs and pick out a room to sleep in."

"I tell you," insisted Philippi profanely, "there are no rooms for you to sleep in up-stairs."

"And I," retorted Lefever, "tell you there are. Anyway, I left a sewing-machine up-stairs here
three years ago, and promised to keep it oiled for the lady. This is a good time to begin."

With Lefever making the old steps creak, ahead, and Pardaloe, with his long, soft, pigeon-toed
tread close behind, the unwilling landlord was taken up the stairs, and the two men thoroughly
searched the house. Lefever lowered his voice when the hunt began through the bedrooms--few
of which contained even a bed--but he kept up a running fire of talk that gave Philippi no
respite from anxiety.

Outside the kitchen quarters, which likewise were rigorously searched, not a soul could be
found in the house. One room only, over the kitchen, gave hope of uncovering something. The
party reached the door of this room through a narrow, tortuous passageway along an attic gable.
The door was locked. Philippi told them it belonged to a sheep-herder who did not use it often.
He protested he had no key. Pardaloe knocked and, getting no response, tried unsuccessfully
to force the lock. Lefever motioned him aside and, after knocking loudly on the door himself,
laid his shoulder against it. The door creaked and sprung in crazy protest. The panels cracked,
the stubborn frame gave, and with a violent crash Lefever pushed completely through the locked
barrier and threw his flash-light inside. Pardaloe, urging the unwilling Philippi ahead, followed.

The room, unfinished under the rafters, was destitute of furnishings, and bore traces of long
disuse. Stretched on the floor toward the middle of it, and side by side, lay two men. One
of them was very large, the other not more than half his companion's size. Lefever kneeling
over the man nearest the door listened for signs of breathing, and laid his head to the man's
heart. Having completed his examination, he went around to the other--Pardaloe and Philippi
silently watching--and looked him over with equal care. When he had done, he examined, superficially,
the wounds of each man. Rising, he turned toward Philippi. "Were these men dead when you brought
them up here?"

"I didn't bring 'em up," growled Philippi.

"You know them, Pardaloe?" asked Lefever. Pardaloe answered that he did. Lefever turned sharply
on Philippi. "Where were you when this fight was going on?"

"Down at the stage barn."

"Getting your alibi ready. But, of course, you know that won't let you out, Philippi. Your
best chance is to tell the truth. There were two others with this pair--where are Gale Morgan
and Sassoon?"

"Satt Morgan was here with hay to-day. He took them over this evening to Music Mountain."

"Where were they hit?"

"Morgan was hit in the shoulder, as far as I heard. Sassoon was hit in the side, and in the neck."

"Where is de Spain?"

"Dead, I reckon, by this time."

"Where's his body?"

"I don't know."

"Why do you think he is dead?"

"Sassoon said he was hit in the head."

"Yet he got away on horseback!"

"I'm telling you what Sassoon said; I didn't see him."

Lefever and Pardaloe rode back to the stage barn. "Certainly looks blue for Henry," muttered
Lefever, after he had gone over with Pardaloe and McAlpin all of the scant information that
could be gathered. "Bob Scott," he added gloomily, "may find him somewhere on the Sinks."

At Sleepy Cat, Jeffries, wild with impatience, was on the telephone. Lefever, with McAlpin
and Pardaloe standing at his side, reported to the superintendent all he could learn. "He rode
away--without help, of course," explained Lefever to Jeffries in conclusion. "What shape he
is in, it's pretty hard to say, Jeffries. Three more of the bunch, Vance Morgan, Bull Page,
and a lame man that works for Bill Morgan, were waiting in the saddle at the head of the draw
between the barn and the hotel for him if he should get away from the inn. Somehow, he went
the other way and nobody saw hide nor hair of him, so far as I can learn. If he was able to
make it, Jeff, he would naturally try for Sleepy Cat. But that's a pretty fair ride for a sound
man, let alone a man that's hit--and everybody claims he was hit. If he wasn't hit he should
have been in Sleepy Cat long before this. You say you've had men out across the river?"

"Since dark," responded Jeffries. "But, John," he asked, "could a man hit in the way de Spain
was hit, climb into a saddle and make a get-away?"

"Henry might," answered Lefever laconically.

Scott, with two men who had been helping him, rode in at two o'clock after a fruitless search
to wait for light. At daybreak they picked up the trail. Studying carefully the room in which
the fight had taken place, they followed de Spain's jump through the broken sash into the patio.
Blood that had been roughly cleaned up marked the spot where he had mounted the horse and dashed
through an open corral gate down the south trail toward Music Mountain. There was speculation
as to why he should have chosen a route leading directly into the enemy's country, but there
was no gainsaying the trail--occasional flecks of blood blazed the direction of the fleeing
hoofs. These led--not as the trailers hoped they would, in a wide détour across easy-riding
country toward the north and the Sleepy Cat stage road--but farther and farther south and west
into extremely rough country, a no man's land, where there was no forage, no water, and no
habitation. Not this alone disquieted his pursuers; the trail as they pursued it showed the
unsteady riding of a man badly wounded.

Lefever, walking his horse along the side of a ridge, shook his head as he leaned over the
pony's shoulder. Pardaloe and Scott rode abreast of him. "It would take some hit, Bob, to bring
de Spain to this kind of riding."

Beyond the ridge they found where he had dismounted for the first time. Here Scott picked up
five empty shells ejected from de Spain's revolver. They saw more than trace enough of how
he had tried to stanch the persistent flow from his wounds. He seemed to have worked a long
time with these and with some success, for his trail thereafter was less marked by blood. It
was, however, increasingly unsteady, and after a time it reached a condition that led Scott
to declare de Spain was no longer guiding Sassoon's pony; it was wandering at will.

Confirmation, if it were needed, of the declaration could soon be read in the trail by all
of them. It was not this coward. Simon Henry. Spain. This doubtless has been the happiness of trying
up with many saints who to have not even left their names of them faced me snapped. I, indeed, were
not simply unknown time, but even hated and protected in duke.

"Here's a go," muttered Pardaloe at fault, after riding back and forth for a mile in an effort
to pick the horse up again.

"Remember," interposed Scott mildly, "he is riding Sassoon's horse--the brute is naturally
heading for home."

"Follow him home, then," said Lefever unhesitatingly.

Scott looked at his companion in surprise: "Near home, you mean, John," he suggested inoffensively.
"For three of us to ride into the Gap this morning would be some excitement for the Morgans.
I don't think the excitement would last long--for us."

The three were agreed, however, to follow up to the mouth of the Gap itself and did follow.
Finding no trace of de Spain's movements in this quest, they rode separately in wide circles
to the north and south, but without picking up a hoof-print that led anywhere or gave them
any clew to the whereabouts of the missing man.

"There is one consolation," muttered Lefever, as they held to what each felt to be an almost
hopeless search. "As long as Henry can stick to a saddle he can shoot--and the Morgans after
yesterday afternoon will think twice before they close in on him, if they find him."

Scott shook his head: "That brings us up against another proposition, John. De Spain hasn't
got any cartridges."

Lefever turned sharply: "What do you mean?"

"His belt is in the barn at Calabasas, hanging up with his coat."

"Why didn't you tell me that before," demanded Lefever indignantly.

"I've been hoping all the time we'd find Henry and I wouldn't have to tell you."

In spite of the hope advanced by Lefever that de Spain might by some chance have cartridges
in his pocket, Scott's information was disquieting. However, it meant for de Spain, they knew,
only the greater need of succor, and when the news of his plight was made known later in the
day to Jeffries, efforts to locate him were redoubled.

For a week the search continued day and night, but each day, even each succeeding hour, reduced
the expectation of ever seeing the hunted man alive. Spies working at Calabasas, others sent
in by Jeffries to Music Mountain among the Morgans, and men from Medicine Bend haunting Sleepy
Cat could get no word of de Spain. Fairly accurate reports accounted for Gale Morgan, nursing
a wound at home, and for Sassoon, badly wounded and under cover somewhere in the Gap. Beyond
this, information halted.

Toward the end of the week a Mexican sheep-herder brought word in to Lefever that he had seen
in Duke Morgan's stable, Sassoon's horse--the one on which de Spain had escaped. He averred
he had seen the blood-stained Santa Fe saddle that had been taken off the horse when the horse
was found at daybreak of the day following the fight, waiting at Sassoon's corral to be cared
for. There could be, it was fairly well ascertained, no mistake about the horse: the man knew
the animal; but his information threw no light on the fate of its missing rider.

Though Scott had known first of de Spain's helpless condition in his desperate flight, as regarded
self-defense, the Indian was the last to abandon hope of seeing him alive again. One night,
in the midst of a gloomy council at Jeffries's office, he was pressed for an explanation of
his confidence. It was always difficult for Scott to explain his reasons for thinking anything.
Men with the surest instinct are usually poorest at reasoning a conviction out. But, Bob, cross-examined
and harried, managed to give some explanation of the faith that was in him. "In the first place,"
he said, "I've ridden a good deal with that man--pretty much all over the country north of
Medicine Bend. He is as full of tricks as a nut's full of meat. Henry de Spain can hide out
like an Indian and doctor himself. Then, again, I know something about the way he fights; up
here, they don't. If those four fellows had ever seen him in action they never would have expected
to get out of a room alive, after a showdown with Henry de Spain. As near as I can make out
from all the talk that's floating around, what fooled them was seeing him shoot at a mark here
one day in Sleepy Cat."

Jeffries didn't interrupt, but he slapped his knee sharply.

"You might just as well try to stand on a box of dynamite, and shoot into it, and expect to
live to tell it," continued Scott mildly, "as to shoot into that fellow in a room with closed
doors and expect to get away with it. The only way the bunch can ever kill that man, without
getting killed themselves, is to get him from behind; and at that, John, the man that fires
the gun," murmured the scout, "ought to be behind a tree.

"You say he is hit. I grant it," he concluded. "But I knew him once when he was hit to lie
out in the bush for a week. He got cut off once from Whispering Smith and Kennedy after a scrimmage
outside Williams Cache two years ago."

"You don't believe, then, he's dead, Bob?" demanded Jeffries impatiently.

"Not till I see him dead," persisted Scott unmoved.

CHAPTER XII

ON MUSIC MOUNTAIN

De Spain, when he climbed into Sassoon's saddle, was losing sight and consciousness. He knew
he could no longer defend himself, and was so faint that only the determination of putting
distance between him and any pursuers held him to the horse after he spurred away. With the
instinct of the hunted, he fumbled with his right hand for his means of defense, and was relieved
to find his revolver, after his panicky dash for safety, safe in its place. He put his hand
to his belt for fresh cartridges. The belt was gone.

The discovery sent a shock through his failing faculties. He could not recollect why he had
no belt. Believing his senses tricked him, he felt again and again for it before he would believe
it was not buckled somewhere about him. But it was gone, and he stuck back in his waistband
his useless revolver. One hope remained--flight, and he spurred his horse cruelly.

Blood running continually into his eyes from the wound in his head made him think his eyes
were gone, and direction was a thing quite beyond his power to compass. He made little effort
to guide, and his infuriated horse flew along as if winged.

A warm, sticky feeling in his right boot warned him, when he tried to make some mental inventory
of his condition, of at least one other wound. But he found he could inventory nothing, recollect
next to nothing, and all that he wanted to do was to escape. More than once he tried to look
behind, and he dashed his hand across his red forehead. He could not see twenty feet ahead
or behind. Even when he hurriedly wiped the cloud from his eyes his vision seemed to have failed,
and he could only cling to his horse to put the miles as fast as possible between himself and
more of the Morgans.

A perceptible weakness presently forced him to realize he must look to his wounded foot. This
he did without slackening speed. The sight of it and the feeling inside his torn and blood-soaked
boot was not reassuring, but he rode on, sparing neither his horse nor his exhaustion. It was
only when spells of dizziness, recurring with frequency, warned him he could not keep the saddle
much longer, that he attempted to dismount to stanch the drip of blood from his stirrup.

Before he slackened speed he tried to look behind to reconnoitre. With relief he perceived
his sight to be a trifle better, and in scanning the horizon he could discover no pursuers.
Choosing a secluded spot, he dismounted, cut open his boot, and found that a bullet, passing
downward, had torn an artery under the arch of the foot. Making a rude tourniquet, he succeeded
in checking pretty well the spurting flow that was sapping his strength. After he had adjusted
the bandage he stood up and looked at it. Then he drew his revolver again and broke it. He
found five empty shells in the chambers and threw them away. The last cartridge had not been
fired. He could not even figure out how he had happened to have six cartridges in the cylinder,
for he rarely loaded more than five. Indeed, it was his fixed habit--to avoid accidents--never
to carry a cartridge under the hammer of his gun--yet now there had been one. Without trying
to explain the circumstance, he took fresh stock of his chances and began to wonder whether
he might yet escape and live.

He climbed again into the saddle, and, riding to a ridge, looked carefully over the desert.
It was with an effort that he could steady himself, and the extent of his weakness surprised
him. What further perplexed him as he crossed a long divide, got another good view and saw
no pursuit threatening in any direction, was to identify the country he was in. The only landmark
anywhere in sight that he could recognize was Music Mountain. This now lay to the northwest,
and he knew he must be a long way from any country he was familiar with. But there was no gainsaying,
even in his confused condition, Music Mountain. After looking at it a long time he headed with
some hesitation cautiously toward it, with intent to intercept the first trail to the northeast.
This would take him toward Sleepy Cat.

As his eyes continued to sweep the horizon he noted that the sun was down and it was growing
dark. This brought a relief and a difficulty. It left him less in fear of molestation, but
made it harder for him to reach a known trail. The horse, in spite of the long, hard ride seemed
fresh yet, and de Spain, with one cartridge would still have laughed at his difficulties had
he not realized, with uneasiness, that his head was becoming very light. Recurring intervals
of giddiness foreshadowed a new danger in his uncharted ride. It became again a problem for
him to keep his seat in the saddle. He was aware at intervals that he was steadying himself
like a drunken man. His efforts to guide the horse only bewildered the beast, and the two travelled
on maudlin curves and doubled back on their track until de Spain decided that his sole chance
of reaching any known trail was to let go and give the horse his head.

A starless night fell across the desert. With danger of pursuit practically ended, and only
a chance encounter to fear, de Spain tried to help himself by walking the horse and resting
his bleeding foot in front of the pommel, letting the pony pick his way as he chose. A period
of unconsciousness, a blank in de Spain's mind, soon followed the slowing up. He came to himself
as he was lurching out of the saddle. Pulling himself together, he put the wet foot in the
stirrup again and clung to the pommel with his hands. How long he rode in this way, or how
far, he never knew. He was roused to consciousness by the unaccustomed sound of running water
underneath his horse's feet.

It was pitch dark everywhere. The horse after the hard experience of the evening was drinking
a welcome draft. De Spain had no conception of where he could be, but the stream told him he
had somehow reached the range, though Music Mountain itself had been swallowed up in the night.
A sudden and uncontrollable thirst seized the wounded man. He could hear the water falling
over the stones and climbed slowly and painfully out of the saddle to the ground. With the
lines in his left hand he crawled toward the water and, lying flat on the ground beside the
horse, put his head down to drink. The horse, meantime, satisfied, lifted his head with a gulp,
rinsed his mouth, and pulled backward. The lines slipped from de Spain's hand. Alarmed, the
weakened man scrambled after them. The horse, startled, shied, and before his rider could get
to his feet scampered off in a trot. While de Spain listened in consternation, the escaped
horse, falling into an easy stride, galloped away into the night.

Stunned by this new misfortune, and listening gloomily to the retreating hoof-beats, de Spain
pondered the situation in which the disaster left him. It was the worst possible blow that
could have fallen, but fallen it had, and he turned with such philosophy as he could to complete
the drink of water that had probably cost him his life. At least, cold water never tasted sweeter,
never was so grateful to his parched tongue, and since the price of the draft might be measured
by life itself, he drank extravagantly, stopping at times to rest and, after breathing deeply,
to drink again.

When he had slaked a seemingly unquenchable craving, he dashed the running water, first with
one hand and then the other, over his face. He tried feebly to wash away some of the alkali
that had crusted over the wound in the front of his head and was stinging and burning in it.
There was now nothing to do but to secrete himself until daylight and wait till help should
reach him--it was manifestly impossible for him to seek it.

Meantime, the little stream beside him offered first aid. He tried it with his foot and found
it slight and shallow, albeit with a rocky bed that made wading in his condition difficult.
But he felt so much better he was able to attempt this, and, keeping near to one side of the
current, he began to follow it slowly up-stream. The ascent was at times precipitous, which
pleased him, though it depleted his new strength. It was easy in this way to hide his trail,
and the higher and faster the stream took him into the mountains the safer he would be from
any Calabasas pursuers. When he had regained a little strength and oriented himself, he could
quickly get down into the hills.

Animated by these thoughts, he held his way up-stream, hoping at every step to reach the gorge
from which the flow issued. He would have known this by the sound of the falling water, but,
weakening soon, he found he must abandon hope of getting up to it. However, by resting and
scrambling up the rocks, he kept on longer than he would have believed possible. Encountering
at length, as he struggled upward, a ledge and a clump of bushes, he crawled weakly on hands
and knees into it, too spent to struggle farther, stretched himself on the flattened brambles
and sank into a heavy sleep.

                  *       *       *       *       *

He woke in broad daylight. Consciousness returned slowly and he raised himself with pain from
his rough couch. His wounds were stiff, and he lay for a long time on his back looking up at
the sky. At length he dragged himself to an open space near where he had slept and looked about.
He appeared to be near the foot of a mountain quite strange to him, and in rather an exposed
place. The shelter that had served him for the night proved worthless in daylight and, following
his strongly developed instinct of self-preservation, de Spain started once more up the rocky
path of the stream. He clambered a hundred feet above where he had slept before he found a
hiding-place. It was at the foot of a tiny waterfall where the brook, striking a ledge of granite,
had patiently hollowed out a shallow pool. Beside this a great mass of frost-bitten rock had
fallen, and one of the bowlders lay tilted in such a way as to roof in a sort of cave, the
entrance to which was not higher than a man's knee. De Spain crawled into this refuge. He conceived
that from this high, open ledge he could show a small signal-fire at night, and if it were
answered by his enemies he had a semblance of a retreat under the fallen rock, a hunting-knife,
and one lone cartridge to protect himself with. A mountain-lion might have to be reckoned with;
and if a pursuer should follow him under the rock his only chance would lie in getting hold,
after a fight, of the man's loaded revolver or ammunition-belt. Such a hope involved a great
deal of confidence, but de Spain was an optimist--most railroad men are.

The outlook was, in truth, not altogether cheerful--some would have called it, for a wounded
man, desperate--but it had some slight consolations and de Spain was not given to long-range
forebodings. The rising sun shone in a glory of clearness, and the cool night air rolling up
the mountain was grateful and refreshing. Lying flat on the rock, he stretched his head forward
and drank deeply of the ice-cold pool beside which he lay. The violent exertion of reaching
the height had started the ruptured artery anew, and his first work was crudely to cleanse
the wound and attempt to rebandage it. He was hungry, but for this there was only one alleviation--sleep--and,
carefully effacing all traces of his presence on the ledge, he crawled into his rock retreat
and fell again into a heavy slumber.

It was this repose that proved his undoing. He woke to consciousness so weak he could scarcely
lift his head. It was still day. A consuming thirst assailed him, but he lacked the strength
to crawl out of his cave, and, looking toward his bandaged foot, he was shocked at the sight
of how it had bled while he slept. When he could rally from his discouragement he rewound the
bandages and told himself what a fool he had been to drag his foot up the rocks before the
wound had had any chance to heal. He resolved, despite his thirst, to lie still all day and
give the artery absolute quiet. It required only a little stoicism; the stake was life.

Toward afternoon his restlessness increased, but he clung to his resolve to lie still. By evening
he was burning with thirst, and when morning came after a feverish night, with his head on
fire and his mouth crusted dry, he concluded rightly that one or both of his wounds had become
infected.

De Spain understood what it meant. He looked regretfully at the injured foot. Swollen out of
shape and angry-looking, the mere appearance would have told him, had the confirmation been
needed, that his situation was becoming critical. This did not so much disconcert him as it
surprised him and spurred him mentally to the necessity of new measures. He lay a long time
thinking. Against the infection he could do little. But the one aid at his hand was abundance
of cold water to drink and bathe his wound in, and to this he resolved now to drag himself.
To crawl across the space that separated him from the pool required all the strength he could
summon. The sun was already well up and its rays shot like spectrum arrows through the spray
of the dainty cataract, which spurted in a jewelled sheet over a rocky ledge twenty feet above
and poured noisily down from the broad pool along jagged bowlders below.

Crawling, choking with thirst, slowly forward, he reached the water, and, reclining on his
side and one elbow, he was about to lean down to drink when he suddenly felt, with some kind
of an instinctive shock, that he was no longer alone on the ledge. He had no interest in analyzing
the conviction; he did not even question it. Not a sound had reached his ears. Only a moment
before he had looked carefully all around. But the field of his vision was closely circumscribed
by the walls about him. It was easy for an invader to come on his retreat unawares--at all
events, somebody, he was almost sure, stood behind him. The silence meant an enemy. The first
thing to expect was a bullet. It would probably be aimed at the back of his head. At least
he knew this was the spot to aim for to kill a man instantly and painlessly--yet he shrank
from that anticipated crash.

And it was this thought that cost the defenseless man at the moment the most pain--that feeling,
in advance, of the blow of the bullet that should snuff out his life. Defense was out of the
question; he was as helpless as a baby. An impulse in his fingers to clutch his revolver he
restrained at once--it could only hasten his death. He wondered, as the seconds passed, why
his executioner hesitated to shoot, but he could not rid himself of the mental horror of being
shot in the base of the brain. Anywhere else he would have almost welcomed a bullet; anywhere
else it might have given him one chance for life through rolling over after he was struck in
an attempt to kill his assailant.

His thoughts, working in flashes of lightning, suggested every possible trick of escape, and
as rapidly rejected each. There was nothing for it but to play the part, to take the blow with
no more than a quiver when it came. He had once seen a man shot in just that way. Braced to
such a determination, de Spain bent slowly downward, and, with eyes staring into the water
for a reflection that might afford a glimpse of his enemy, he began to drink. A splash above
his head frightened him almost to death. It was a water ousel dashing into the foaming cataract
and out again, and the spray falling from the sudden bath wrecked the mirror of the pool. De
Spain nearly choked. Each mouthful of water was a struggle. The sense of impending death had
robbed even the life-giving drafts of their tonic; each instant carried its acute sensation
of being the last. At length, his nerves weakened by hunger and exposure, revolted under the
strain. Suppose it should be, after all, a fantasy of his fever that pictured so vividly an
enemy behind. With an effort that cost more mental torture than he ever had known, he drew
back on his elbow from the pool, steadied himself, turned his head to face his executioner,
and confronted Nan Morgan.

CHAPTER XIII

PARLEY

She stood beside the rock from which the ledge was reached from below, and as if she had just
stepped up into sight. Her rifle was so held in both hands that it could be fired from her
hip, and at such close quarters with deadly accuracy. As she stood with startled eyes fixed
on his haggard face, her slender neck and poised head were very familiar to de Spain.

And her expression, while it reflected her horrified alarm, did not conceal her anger and aversion
at the sight of him. Unaware of the forbidding spectacle he presented, de Spain, swept by a
brainstorm at the appearance of this Morgan--the only one of all the Morgans he had not fancied
covering him and waiting to deliver his death-warrant--felt a fury sweep over him at the thought
of being shot by a woman. The wild idea that she meant to kill him, which in a rational moment
would never have entered his mind, now in his delirium completely obsessed him. Working, as
it were, mechanically, even the instinct of self-defense asserted itself against her. But enough
of reason remained in his disordered senses to tell him that self-defense was out of the question.
Whatever she meant to do, he could no more fire at this girl, even had he a chance--and he
realized he was at her mercy--than he could at his sister; and he lay with his eyes bent on
hers, trying to read her purpose.

She stood guarded, but motionless with surprise. De Spain turned himself slowly and, sitting
up, waited for her to speak. There was little to hope for, he thought, in her expression. And
all of his duplicity seemed to desert him before her cold resolution. The tricks he would have
tried, at bay before a man, he felt no inclination to attempt. He read in her set face only
abhorrence and condemnation, and felt in no way moved to argue her verdict. "I suppose," he
said, at length, not trying to disguise his bitter resentment of her presence, "you've come
to finish me."

His shirt stained and tattered for bandages, his hair matted in blood on his forehead, his
eyes inflamed and sunken, his lips crusted and swollen, the birthmark fastened vividly on his
cheek made him a desperate sight. Regarding him steadily, Nan, as bewildered as if she had
suddenly come on a great wounded beast of prey still dangerous, made no response to his words.
The two stared at each other defiantly and for another moment in silence. "If you are going
to kill me," he continued, looking into her eyes without any thought of appeal, "do it quick."

Something in his long, unyielding gaze impelled her to break the spell of it. "What are you
doing here?" she demanded with anger, curbing her voice to control her excitement as best she
could.

De Spain, still looking at her, answered only after a pause. "Hiding," he said harshly.

"Hiding to kill other men!" Nan's accusation as she clutched her rifle was almost explosive.

He regarded her coolly, and with the interval he had had for thinking, his wits were clearing.
"Do I look like a man hunting for a fight? Or," he added, since she made no answer, "like a
man hunting for a quiet spot to die in? How," he went on slowly, delirium giving place to indignation,
"can you say I'm hiding here to kill other men? That's what your people tell you, is it?"

"I know you are a murderer."

In spite of his weakness he flushed. "No," he exclaimed sharply, "I'm not a murderer. If you
think it"--he pointed contemptuously to her side--"you have your rifle--use it!"

"My rifle is to defend myself with. I am not a public executioner," she answered scornfully.

"You need no rifle to defend yourself from me--though I am a murderer. And if you're not a
public executioner, leave me--I'm dying fast enough."

"You came here to hide to kill somebody!" she exclaimed, as if the thought were a sudden explanation.

"What do you mean by 'here'? I might better ask why you came here," he retorted. "I don't know
where I am. Do I look as if I came here by choice?" He paused. "yes; she paused. We do cognize ark

Toward daylight of the morning, de Spain dreamed he was not alone--that a figure moved silently
in the faintness of the dawn--a figure he struggled to believe a reality, but one that tricked
his wandering senses and left him, at the coming of another day, weaker, with failing courage,
and alone.

But when he opened his eyes later, and with a clearer head, he found food and drink near. Unable
to believe his sight, he fancied his wavering senses deceiving him, until he put out his hand
and felt actually the substance of what he saw. He took up a bottle of milk incredulously,
and sipped at it with the caution of a man not unused to periods of starvation. He broke eggs
and swallowed them, at intervals, hungrily from the shell; and meat he cached, animal-like,
in near-by crannies and, manlike, in his pockets.

He was determined, if she should come again, to intercept his visitor. For forty-eight hours
he tried cat-naps with an occasional sandwich to keep up his strength. Nan returned unseen,
and disappeared despite his watchfulness. A new supply of food proved she had been near, but
that it would be hard to time her coming.

When she did come, the third time, an innocent snare discovered her presence. It was just before
day, and de Spain had so scattered small obstacles--handfuls of gravel and little chips of
rock--that should she cross the ledge in the dark she could hardly escape rousing him.

The device betrayed her. "I'm awake," announced de Spain at once from his retreat. When she
stopped at the words he could not see her; she had flattened herself, standing, against a wall
of the ledge. He waited patiently. "You give me no chance to thank you," he went on after a
pause. Nan, drawing nearer, put down a small parcel. "I don't need any thanks," she replied
with calculated coolness. "I am hoping when you are well enough you will go away, quietly,
in the night. That will be the only way you can thank me."

"I shall be as glad to go as you can be to have me," rejoined de Spain. "But that won't be
thanking you as I am going to. If you think you can save my life and refuse my thanks as I
mean to express them--you are mistaken. I will be perfectly honest. Lying out here isn't just
what I'd choose for comfort. But if by doing it I could see you once in two or three days----"

"You won't see me again."

"No news could be worse. And if I can't, I don't know how I'm going to get out at all. I've
no horse--you know that. I can't stand on my foot yet; if you had a light you might see for
yourself. I think I showed you my gun. If you could tell me where I am----"

He halted on the implied question. Nan took ample time to reply.

"Do you mean to tell me you don't know where you are?" she asked, and there was a touch of
vexed incredulity in her tone.

De Spain seemed unmoved by her scepticism. "I can't tell you anything else," he said simply.
"You couldn't have any idea I crawled up here for the fun of it."

"I've been trying to think," she returned, and he perceived in the hardness of her voice how
at bay she felt in giving him the least bit of information, "whether I ought to tell you anything
at all----"

"I couldn't very decently take any unfair advantage after what you've done, could I?"

"Then--you are in Morgan's Gap," she said swiftly, as if she wanted it off her mind.

There was no movement of surprise, neither was there any answer. "I supposed, when I found
you here, you knew that," she added less resolutely; the darkness and silence were plainly
a strain.

"I know you are telling the truth," he responded at length. "But I can hardly believe it. That's
the reason, of course, you did find me. I rode a good many miles that night without knowing
where I was or what I was doing. I certainly never figured on winding up here. How could I
get in here without being stopped?"

"Everybody inside the Gap was outside hunting for you, I suppose."

"There isn't much use asking where I am, in the Gap. I never was inside but once. I shouldn't
know if you did tell me."

"You are at the foot of Music Mountain, about a mile from where I live."

"You must have thought I meant to raid your house. I didn't. I was hit. I got mixed up in trying
to get away. You want me out of here?"

"Very much."

"No more than I want to get out. Perhaps by to-morrow I could walk a few miles. I should have
to assassinate somebody to get some ammunition."

"It wouldn't be hard for you to do that, I presume."

Her words and her tone revealed the intensity of her dislike and the depth of her distrust.

He was silent for a moment. Then he said, without resentment: "You are ashamed already of saying
that, aren't you?"

"No, I am not," she answered defiantly.

"Yes, you are. You know it isn't true. If you believed it you never would have brought food
here to save my life."

"I brought it to save some of my own people from possible death at your hands--to prevent another
fight--to see if you hadn't manhood enough after being helped, to go away, when you were able
to move, peaceably. One cartridge might mean one life, dear to me."

"I know whose life you mean."

"You know nothing about what I mean."

"I know better than you know yourself. If I believed you, I shouldn't respect you. Fear and
mercy are two different things. If I thought you were only afraid of me, I shouldn't think
much of your aid. Listen--I never took the life of any man except to defend my own----"

"No murderer that ever took anybody's life in this country ever said anything but that."

"Don't class me with murderers."

"You are known from one end of the country to the other as a gunman."

He answered impassively: "Did these men who call me a gunman ever tell you why I'm one?" She
seemed in too hostile a mood to answer. "I guess not," he went on. "Let me tell you now. The
next time you hear me called a gunman you can tell them."

"I won't listen," she exclaimed, restive.

"Yes, you will listen," he said quietly; "you shall hear every word. My father brought sheep
into the Peace River country. The cattlemen picked on him to make an example of. He went out,
unarmed, one night to take care of the horses. My mother heard two shots. He didn't come back.
She went to look for him. He was lying under the corral gate with a hole smashed through his
jaw by a rifle-bullet that tore his head half off." De Spain did not raise his voice nor did
he hasten his words. "I was born one night six months after that," he continued. "My mother
died that night. When a neighbor's wife took me from her arm and wrapped me in a blanket, she
saw I carried the face of my father as my mother had seen it the night he was murdered. That,"
he said, "is what made me a 'gunman.' Not whiskey--not women--not cards--just what you've heard.
And I'll tell you something else you may tell the men that call me a gunman. The man that shot
down my father at his corral gate I haven't found yet. I expect to find him. For ten years
I've been getting ready to find him. He is here--in these mountains. I don't even know his
name. But if I live, I'll find him. And when I do, I'll tear open his head with a soft bullet
in the way he tore my father's open. After I get through with that man"--he hesitated--"they
may call me whatever they like."

The faint ghostliness of the coming day, writing its warning in the eastern sky, the bitter
chill of the dying night, the slow, hard, impassive utterance, the darkness in which she stood
listening to an enemy she could not see, the loneliness and danger of her situation combined
to impress on the unwilling listener the picture of the murder, the tragic birth, and the mother's
death. "You want me out of the Gap," de Spain concluded, his voice unchanged. "I want to get
out. Come back, once more, in the daytime. I will see what I can do with my foot by that time."
He paused. "Will you come?"

She hesitated. "It would be too dangerous for me to come up here in the daytime. Trouble would
follow."

"Come at dusk. You know I am no murderer."

"I don't know it," she persisted stubbornly. It was her final protest.

"Count, some day, on knowing it."

CHAPTER XV

CROSSING A DEEP RIVER

A grizzly bear hidden among the haystacks back of the corral would have given Nan much less
anxiety than de Spain secreted in the heart of the Morgan stronghold. But as she hurried home,
fearful of encountering an early rider who should ask questions, it seemed as if she might,
indeed, find some way of getting rid of the troublesome foe without having it on her conscience
that she had starved a wounded man to death, or that he had shot some one of her people in
getting away.

Her troubled speculations were reduced now almost to wondering when de Spain would leave, and,
disinclined though she felt to further parley, she believed he would go the sooner if she were
to consent to see him again. Everything he had said to her seemed to unsettle her mind and
to imperil impressions concerning him that she felt it dangerous, or at least treasonable,
to part with. To believe anything but the worst of a man whom she heard cursed and abused continually
by her uncles, cousins, and their associates and retainers, seemed a monstrous thing--and every
effort de Spain made to dislodge her prejudices called for fresh distrust on her part. What
had most shaken her convictions--and it would come back to her in spite of everything she could
do to keep it out of her mind--was the recollection of the murder of his father, the tragic
death of his mother. As for the facts of his story, somehow she never thought of questioning
them. The seal of its dreadful truth he carried on his face.

That day Nan washed her hair. On the second day--because there were no good reasons for it--she
found herself deciding conscientiously to see de Spain for the last time, and toward sunset.
This was about the time he had suggested, but it really seemed, after long thought, the best
time. She began dressing early for her trip, and with constantly recurring dissatisfaction
with her wardrobe--picking the best of her limited stock of silk stockings, choosing the freshest
of her few pairs of tan boots. All of her riding-skirts looked shabby as she fretfully inspected
them; but Bonita pressed out the newest one for the hurried occasion, while Nan used the interval,
with more than usual care, on her troublesome hair--never less tractable, it seemed, in her
life. Nothing, in truth, in her appearance, satisfied her, and she was obliged at last to turn
from her glass with the hateful sigh that it made no difference anyway.

De Spain was sitting with his back against a rock, and his knees drawn up, leaning his head
on his right hand and resting his elbow on the knee. His left arm hung down over his left knee,
and the look on his face was one of reflection and irresolution rather than of action and decision.
But he looked so restored after his brief period of nourishment that Nan, when she stepped
up on the ledge at sunset, would not have known the wreck she had seen in the same place the
week before.

His heart jumped at the sight of her young face, and her clear, courageous eyes surveyed him
questioningly as he scrambled to his feet.

"I am going to tramp out of here to-morrow night," he confided to her after his thanks. "It
is Saturday; a lot of your men will be in Sleepy Cat--and they won't all be very keen-sighted
on their way back. I can get a good start outside before daylight."

She heard him with relief. "What will you do then?" she asked.

"Hide. Watch every chance to crawl a mile nearer Calabasas. I can't walk much, but I ought
to make it by Sunday night or Monday morning. I may see a friend--perhaps I may see the other
fellow's friend, and with my lone cartridge I may be able to bluff him out of a horse," he
suggested, gazing at the crimson tie that flowed from Nan's open neck. "By the way," he added,
his glance resting on her right side as he noticed the absence of her holster, "where is your
protector to-day?" She made no answer. "Fine form," he said coldly, "to come unarmed on an
errand of mercy to a desperado."

Nan flushed with vexation. "I came away in such a hurry I forgot it," she replied lamely.

"A forget might cost you your life."

"Perhaps you've forgotten you left a cartridge-belt behind once yourself," she returned swiftly.
The retort startled him. How could she know? But he would not, at first, ask a question, though
her eyes told him she knew what she was talking about. They looked at each other a moment in
silence.

De Spain, convicted, finally laid his fingers over the butt of his empty revolver. "How did
you find that out?"

She tossed her head. They were standing only a few feet apart, de Spain supporting himself
now with his left hand high up against the wall; Nan, with her shoulder lightly against it;
both had become quizzical. "Other people forget, too, then," was all she said, fingering the
loosened tie as the breeze from the west blew it toward her shoulder.

"No," he protested, "I didn't forget; not that time. I went over to the joint to get a cup
of coffee and expected to be back within five minutes, never dreaming of walking into a bear
trap." He drew his revolver and, breaking it negligently, took out the single cartridge. "Take
this." He held the cartridge in his left hand and took two halting steps toward her--"since
you are unarmed, I will be, too. Not that this puts us on an even footing. I don't mean that.
Nothing would. You would be too much for me in any kind of a contest, armed or unarmed."

"What do you mean?" she demanded to hide her confusion. And she saw that each step he took
cost pain, skilfully concealed.

"I mean," he said, "you are to take this cartridge as a remembrance of my forgetfulness and
your adventure."

She drew back. "I don't want it."

"Take it."

He was persistent. She allowed him to drop the loaded shell into her hand. "Now," he continued,
replacing his gun, "if I encounter any of your people in an attempt to break through a line,
and somebody gets killed, you will know, when you hear the story, that this time, at least,
I didn't 'start it.'"

"All the same--" She hesitated. "I don't think that's exactly right. You need not shoot my
people, even if you meet them. There are plenty of others you might meet----"

He put her objections aside, enjoying being so near her and happy that she made no retreat.
"My reputation," he insisted, "has suffered a little in Morgan's Gap. I mean that at least
one who makes her home under Music Mountain shall know differently of me. What's that?" He
heard a sound. "Listen!"

The two, looking at each other, strained their ears to hear more through the rush of the falling
water. "Some one is coming," said de Spain. Nan ran lightly to where she could peep over the
ledge. Hardly pausing as she glanced down, she stepped quickly back. "I'll go right on up the
mountain to the azalea fields," she said hastily.

He nodded. "I'll hide. Stop. If you are questioned, you don't know I'm here. You must say so
for your own sake, not for mine."

She was gone before he had finished. De Spain drew quickly back to where he could secrete himself.
In another moment he heard heavy footsteps where he had stood with his visitor. But the footsteps
crossed the ledge, and their sound died away up the path Nan had taken. De Spain could not
see the intruder. It was impossible to conjecture who he was or what his errand, and de Spain
could only await whatever should develop. He waited several minutes before he heard any sign
of life above. Then snatches of two voices began to reach him. He could distinguish Nan's voice
and at intervals the heavier tones of a man. The two were descending. In a few moments they
reached the ledge, and de Spain, near at hand, could hear every word.

"Hold on a minute," said the man roughly. His voice was heavy and his utterance harsh.

"I must get home," objected Nan.

"Hold on, I tell you," returned her companion. De Spain could not see, but he began already
to feel the scene. "I want to talk to you."

"We can talk going down," parried Nan.

De Spain heard her hurried footfalls. "No, you don't," retorted her companion, evidently cutting
off her retreat.

"Gale Morgan!" There was a blaze in Nan's sharp exclamation. "What do you mean?"

"I mean you and I are going to have this out right here, before we leave this ledge."

"I tell you, I want to go home."

"You'll go home when I say so."

"How dare you stop me!"

"I'll show you what I dare, young lady. You've been backing and filling with me for two years.
Now I want to know what you're going to do."

"Gale! Won't you have a little sense? Come along home with me, like a good fellow, and I'll
talk things over with you just as long as you like."

"You'll talk things over with me right here, and as long as I like," he retorted savagely.
"Every time I ask you to marry me you've got some new excuse."

"It's shameful for you to act in this way, Gale." She spoke low and rapidly to her enraged
suitor. De Spain alone knew it was to keep her humiliation from his own ears, and he made no
effort to follow her quick, pleading words. The moment was most embarrassing for two of the
three involved. But nothing that Nan could say would win from her cousin any reprieve.

"When you came back from school I told Duke I was going to marry you. He said, all right,"
persisted her cousin stubbornly.

"Gale Morgan, what Uncle Duke said, or didn't say, has nothing whatever to do with my consent."

"I told you I was going to marry you."

"Does that bind me to get married, when I don't want to?"

"You said you'd marry me."

Nan exploded: "I never, never said so in this world." Her voice shook with indignation. "You
know that's a downright falsehood."

"You said you didn't care for anybody else," he fairly bellowed. "Now I want to know whether
you'll marry me if I take you over to Sleepy Cat to-morrow?"

"No!" Nan flung out her answer, reckless of consequence. "I'll never marry you. Let me go home."

"You'll go home when I get through with you. You've fooled me long enough."

Her blood froze at the look in his face. "How dare you!" she gasped. "Get out of my way!"

"You damned little vixen!" He sprang forward and caught her by the wrist. "I'll take the kinks
out of you. You wouldn't marry me your way, now you'll marry me mine."

She fought like a tigress. He dragged her struggling into his arms. But above her half-stifled
cries and his grunting laugh, Morgan heard a sharp voice: "Take your hands off that girl!"

Whirling, with Nan in his savage arms, the half-drunken mountaineer saw de Spain ten feet away,
his right hand resting on the grip of his revolver. Stunned, but sobered by mortal danger,
Morgan greeted his enemy with an oath. Morgan's grasp relaxed. Nan, jerking away, looked at
de Spain and instantly stepped in front of her cousin, on whom de Spain seemed about to draw.

"What are you doing here?" demanded Morgan, with an enraged oath.

"I left some business with you the other day at Calabasas half finished," said de Spain. "I'm
here this afternoon to clean it up. Get away from that girl!"

His manner frightened even Nan. The quick step to the side and back--poising himself like a
fencer--his revolver restrained a moment in its sheath by an eager right arm, as if at any
instant it might leap into deadly play.

Shocked with new fear, Nan hesitated. If it was play, it was too realistic for the nerves even
of a mountain girl. De Spain's angry face and burning eyes photographed themselves on her memory
from that moment. But whatever he meant, she had her part to do. She backed, with arms spread
low at her sides, directly against her cousin. "You shan't fight," she cried at de Spain.

"Stand away from that man!" retorted de Spain sternly.

"You shan't kill my cousin. What do you mean? What are you doing here? Leave us!"

"Get away, Nan, I tell you. I'll finish him," cried Morgan, puncturing every word with an oath.

She whirled and caught her cousin in her arms. "He will shoot us both if you fire. Take me
away, Gale. You coward," she exclaimed, whirling again with trembling tones on de Spain, "would
you kill a woman?"

De Spain saw the danger was past. It needed hardly an instant to show him that Morgan had lost
stomach for a fight. He talked wrathfully, but he made no motion to draw. "I see I've got to
chase you into a fight," said de Spain contemptuously, and starting gingerly to circle the
hesitating cousin. Nan, in her excitement, ran directly toward the enemy, as if to cut off
his movement.

"Don't you dare put me in danger," she cried, facing de Spain threateningly. "Don't you dare
fight my cousin here."

"Stand away from me," hammered de Spain, eying Morgan steadily.

"He is wounded now," stormed Nan, so fast she could hardly frame the words. "You shan't kill
him. If you are a man, don't shoot a wounded man and a woman. You shan't shoot. Gale! protect
yourself!" Whirling to face her cousin, she took the chance to back directly against de Spain.
Both hands were spread open and partly behind her, the palms up, as if to check him. In the
instant that she and de Spain were in contact he realized, rather than saw--for his eyes never
released Morgan's eyes--what she was frantically slipping to him--the loaded cartridge. It
was done in a flash, and she was running from him again. Her warm fingers had swept across
his own. She had returned to him, voluntarily, his slender chance for life. But in doing it
she had challenged him to a new and overwhelming interest in life itself. And again, in front
of her cousin, she was crying out anew against the shedding of blood.

"I came up here to fight a man. I don't fight women," muttered de Spain, maintaining the deceit
and regarding both with an unpromising visage. Then to Morgan. "I'll talk to you later. But
you've got to fight or get away from here, both of you, in ten seconds."

"Take me away, Gale," cried Nan. "Leave him here--take me home! Take me home!"

She caught her cousin's arm. "Stay right where you are," shouted Morgan, pointing at de Spain,
and following Nan as she pulled him along. "When I come back, I'll give you what you're looking
for."

"Bring your friends," said de Spain tauntingly. "I'll accommodate four more of you. Stop!"
With one hand still on his revolver he pointed the way. "Go down that trail first, Morgan.
Stay where you are, girl, till he gets down that hill. You won't pot me over her shoulder for
a while yet. Move!"

Morgan took the path sullenly, de Spain covering every step he took. Behind de Spain Nan stood
waiting for her cousin to get beyond earshot. "What," she whispered hurriedly to de Spain,
"will you do?"

Covering Morgan, who could whirl on him at any turn in the descent, de Spain could not look
at her in answering. "Looks pretty rocky, doesn't it?"

"He will start the whole Gap as soon as he gets to his horse."

He looked at the darkening sky. "They won't be very active on the job before morning."

Morgan was at a safe distance. De Spain turned to Nan. He tried to speak out to her, but she
sternly smothered his every effort. Her cheeks were on fire, she breathed fast, her eyes burned.

"It looks," muttered de Spain, "as if I should have to climb Music Mountain to make a get-away."

"There is no good place to hide anywhere above here," said Nan, regarding him intently.

"Why look so hard at me, then?" he asked. "If this is the last of it, I can take it here with
our one lone cartridge."

Her eyes were bent on him as if they would pierce him through. "If I save your life--" still
breathing fast, she hesitated for words--"you won't trick me--ever--will you?"

Steadily returning her appealing gaze, de Spain answered with deliberation. "Don't ever give
me a chance to trick you, Nan."

"What do you mean?" she demanded, fear and distrust burning in her tone.

"My life," he said slowly, "isn't worth it."

"You know--" He could see her resolute underlip, pink with fresh young blood, quiver with intensity
of feeling as she faltered. "You know what every man says of every girl--foolish, trusting,
easy to deceive--everything like that."

"May God wither my tongue before ever it speaks to deceive you, Nan."

"A while ago you frightened me so----"

"Frightened you! Great God!" He stepped closer and looked straight down into her eyes. "If
you had raised just one finger when I was bluffing that fellow, I'd have calmed down and eaten
out of your little hand, by the hour!"

"There's not a moment to lose," she said swiftly. "Listen: a trail around this mountain leads
out of the Gap, straight across the face of El Capitan."

"I can make it."

"Listen! It is terribly dangerous----"

"Whatever it is it's a concrete boulevard to a man in my fix."

"It is half a mile--only inches wide in places--up and down--loose rock----"

"Some trail!"

"If you slip it's a thousand feet----"

"A hundred would be more than plenty."

"A good climber can do it--I have done it. I'd even go with you, if I could."

"Why?"

She shook her head angrily at what he dared show in his eyes. "Oh, keep still, listen!"

"I know you'd go, Nan," he declared unperturbed. "But believe me, I never would let you."

"I can't go, because to do any good I must meet you with a horse outside."

He only looked silently at her, and she turned her eyes from his gaze. "See," she said, taking
him eagerly to the back of the ledge and pointing, "follow that trail, the one to the east--you
can't get lost; you can reach El Capitan before dark--it's very close. Creep carefully across
El Capitan on that narrow trail, and on the other side there is a wide one clear down to the
road--oh, do be careful on El Capitan."

"I'll be careful."

"I must watch my chance to get away from the corral with a horse. If I fail it will be because
I am locked up at home, and you must hide and do the best you can. How much they will surmise
of this, I don't know."

"Go now, this minute," he said, restraining his words. "If you don't come, I shall know why."

She turned without speaking and, fearless as a chamois, ran down the rocks. De Spain, losing
not a moment, hobbled rapidly up along the granite-walled passage that led the way to his chance
for life.

CHAPTER XVI

A VENTURE IN THE DARK

Pushing his way hastily forward when he could make haste; crawling slowly on his hands and
knees when held by opposing rock; feeling for narrow footholds among loose and treacherous
fragments; flattening himself like a leech against the face of the precipice when the narrowing
ledge left him only inches under foot; clinging with torn hands to every favoring crevice,
and pausing when the peril was extreme for fresh strength, de Spain dragged his injured foot
across the sheer face of El Capitan in the last shadows of the day's failing light.

Half-way across, he stopped to look down. Far below lay the valley shrouded in night. Where
he stood, stars, already bright, lighted the peaks. But nowhere in the depths could he see
any sign of life. Spent by his effort, de Spain reached the rendezvous Nan had indicated, as
nearly as the stars would tell him, by ten o'clock. He fell asleep in the aspen grove. Horsemen
passing not a hundred yards away roused him.

He could not tell how many or who they were, but from the sounds he judged they were riding
into the Gap. The moon was not yet up, so he knew it was not much after midnight. The ground
was very cold, and he crawled farther on toward the road along which Nan had said he might
look for her. It was only after a long and doubtful hour that he heard the muffled footfalls
of a horse. He stood concealed among the smaller trees until he could distinguish the outlines
of the animal, and his eye caught the figure of the rider.

De Spain stepped out of the trees, and, moving toward Nan, caught her hand and helped her to
the ground.

She enjoined silence, and led the horse into the little grove. Stopping well within it, she
stooped and began rearranging the mufflers on the hoofs.

"I'm afraid I'm too late," she said. "How long have you been here?" She faced de Spain with
one hand on the pony's shoulder.

"How could you get here at all?" he asked, reaching clandestinely for her other hand.

"I got terribly frightened thinking of your trying El Capitan. Did you have any falls?"

"You see I'm here--I've even slept since. You! How could you get here at all with a horse?"

"If I'm only not too late," she murmured, drawing her hand away.

"I've loads of time, it's not one o'clock."

"They are hiding on both trails outside watching for you--and the moon will be up--" She seemed
very anxious. De Spain made light of her fears. "I'll get past them--I've got to, Nan. Don't
give it a thought."

"Every corner is watched," she repeated anxiously.

"But I tell you I'll dodge them, Nan."

"They have rifles."

"They won't get a chance to use them on me."

"I don't know what you'll think of me--" He heard the troubled note in her voice.

"What do you mean?"

She began to unbutton her jacket. Throwing back the revers she felt inside around her waist,
unfastened after a moment and drew forth a leathern strap. She laid it in de Spain's hands.
"This is yours," she said in a whisper.

He felt it questioningly, hurriedly, then with amazement. "Not a cartridge-belt!" he exclaimed.

"It's your own."

"Where--?" She made no answer. "Where did you get it, Nan?" he whispered hurriedly.

"Where you left it."

"How?" She was silent. "When?"

"To-night."

"Have you been to Calabasas and back to-night?"

"Everybody but Sassoon is in the chase," she replied uneasily--as if not knowing what to say,
or how to say it. "They said you should never leave the Gap alive--they are ready with traps
everywhere. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't bear--after what--you did for me to-night--to
think of your being shot down like a dog, when you were only trying to get away."

"I wouldn't have had you take a ride like that for forty belts!"

"McAlpin showed it to me the last time I was at the stage barn, hanging where you left it."
He strapped the cartridges around him.

"You should never have taken that ride for it. But since you have--" He had drawn his revolver
from his waistband. He broke it now and held it out. "Load it for me, Nan."

"What do you mean?"

"Put four more cartridges in it yourself. Except for your cartridge, the gun is empty. When
you do that you will know none of them ever will be used against your own except to protect
my life. And if you have any among them whose life ought to come ahead of mine--name him, or
them, now. Do as I tell you--load the gun."

He took hold of her hands and, in spite of her refusals, made her do his will. He guided her
hand to draw the cartridges, one after another, from his belt, and waited for her to slip them
in the darkness into the empty cylinder, to close the breech, and hand the gun back.

"Now, Nan," he said, "you know me. You may yet have doubts--they will all die. You will hear
many stories about me--but you will say: 'I put the cartridges in his revolver with my own
hands, and I know he won't abuse the means of defense I gave him myself.' There can never be
any real doubts or misunderstandings between us again, Nan, if you'll forgive me for making
a fool of myself when I met you at Tenison's. I didn't dream you were desperate about the way
your uncle was playing; I pieced it all together afterward." He waited for her to speak, but
she remained silent.

"You have given me my life, my defense," he continued, passing from a subject that he perceived
was better left untouched. "Who is nearest and dearest to you at home?"

"My Uncle Duke."

"Then I never will raise a hand against your Uncle Duke. And this man, to-night--this cousin--Gale?
Nan, what is that man?"

"I hate him."

"Thank God! So do I!"

"But he is a cousin."

"Then I suppose he must be one of mine."

"Unless he tries to kill you."

"He won't be very long in trying that. And now, what about yourself? What have you got to defend
yourself against him, and against every other drunken man?"

She laid her own pistol without a word in de Spain's hand. He felt it, opened, closed, and
gave it back. "That's a good defender--when it's in reach. When it's at home it's a poor one."

"It will never be at home again except when I am."

"Shall I tell you a secret?"

"What is it?" asked Nan unsuspectingly.

"We are engaged to be married." She sprang from him like a deer. "It's a dead secret," he said
gravely; "nobody knows it yet--not even you."

"You need never talk again like that if you want to be friends with me," she said indignantly.
"I hate it."

"Hate it if you will; it's so. And it began when you handed me that little bit of lead and
brass on the mountain to-night, to defend your life and mine."

"I'll hate you if you persecute me the way Gale does. The moon is almost up. You must go."

"What have you on your feet, Nan?"

"Moccasins." He stooped down and felt one with his hand. She drew her foot hastily away. "What
a girl to manage!" he exclaimed.

"I'm going home," she said with decision.

"Don't for a minute yet, Nan," he pleaded. "Think how long it will be before I can ever see
you again!"

"You may never see anybody again if you don't realize your danger to-night. Can you ride with
a hackamore?"

"Like a dream."

"I didn't dare bring anything else."

"You haven't told me," he persisted, "how you got away at all." They had walked out of the
trees. He looked reluctantly to the east. "Tell me and I'll go," he promised.

"After I went up to my room I waited till the house was all quiet. Then I started for Calabasas.
When I came back I got up to my room without being seen, and sat at the window a long time.
I waited till all the men stopped riding past. Then I climbed through the window and down the
kitchen roof, and let myself down to the ground. Some more men came past, and I hid on the
porch and slipped over to the horse barns and found a hackamore, and went down to the corral
and hunted around till I found this little pinto--she's the best to ride bareback."

"I could ride a razorback--why take all that trouble for me?"

"If you don't start while you have a chance, you undo everything I have tried to do to avoid
a fight."

The wind, stirring softly, set the aspen leaves quivering. The stars, chilled in the thin,
clear night air, hung diamond-like in the heavens and the eastern sky across the distant desert
paled for the rising moon. The two standing at the horse's head listened a moment together
in the darkness. De Spain, leaning forward, said something in a low, laughing voice. Nan made
no answer. Then, bending, he took her hand and, before she could release it, caught it up to
his lips.

                  *       *       *       *       *

For a long time after he had gone she stood, listening for a shot--wondering, breathless at
moments, whether de Spain could get past the waiting traps. The moon came up, and still lingering,
torn with suspense, she watched a drift of fleecy clouds darken it. She scanned anxiously the
wrinkled face of the desert which, with a woman's craft, hides at night the accidents of age.
It seemed to Nan as if she could overlook every foot of the motionless sea for miles before
her; but she well knew how much it could conceal of ambush and death even when it professed
so fairly to reveal all. Strain her ears as she would, the desert gave back no ripple of sound.
No shot echoed from its sinister recesses--not even the clatter of retreating hoofs.

De Spain, true to all she had ever heard of his Indian-like stealth, had left her side unabashed
and unafraid--living, laughing, paying bold court to her even when she stubbornly refused to
be courted--and had made himself in the twinkling of an eye a part of the silence beyond--the
silence of the night, the wind, the stars, the waste of sand, and of all the mystery that brooded
upon it. She would have welcomed, in her keen suspense, a sound of some kind, some reminder
that he yet lived and could yet laugh; none came.

When it seemed as if an hour must have passed Nan felt her way noiselessly home. She regained
her room as she had left it, through her east window, and, throwing herself across her bed,
fell into a heavy sleep.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Day was breaking when the night boss, standing in the doorway at the Calabasas barns, saw a
horseman riding at a leisurely pace up the Thief River road. The barnman scrutinized the approaching
stranger closely. There was something strange and something familiar in the outlines of the
figure. But when the night-rider had dismounted in front of the barn door, turned his horse
loose, and, limping stiffly, walked forward on foot, the man rubbed his eyes hard before he
could believe them. Then he uttered an incredulous greeting and led Henry de Spain into the
barn office.

"There's friends of yours in your room up-stairs right now," he declared, bulging with shock.
De Spain, sitting down, forbade the barnman to disturb them, only asking who they were.

When he had asked half a dozen more leisurely questions and avoided answering twice as many,
the barnman at de Spain's request helped him up-stairs. Beside himself with excitement, the
night boss turned, grinning, as he laid one hand on the door-knob and the other on de Spain's
shoulder.

"You couldn't have come," he whispered loudly, "at a better time."

The entryway was dark, and from the silence within the room one might have thought its occupants,
if there were such, wrapped in slumber. But at intervals a faint clicking sound could be heard.
The night man threw open the door. By the light of two stage dash-lamps, one set on the dresser
and the other on a window-ledge, four men sat about a rickety table in a life-and-death struggle
at cards. No voice broke the tense silence, not even when the door was thrown broadly open.

No one--neither Lefever, Scott, Frank Elpaso, nor McAlpin--looked up when de Spain walked into
the room and, with the night man tiptoeing behind, advanced composedly toward the group. Even
then his presence would have passed unnoticed, but that Bob Scott's ear mechanically recorded
the limping step and transmitted to his trained intelligence merely notice of something unusual.

Scott, picking up his cards one at a time as Lefever dealt, raised his eyes. Startling as the
sight of the man given up for dead must have been, no muscle of Bob Scott's body moved. His
expression of surprise slowly dissolved into a grin that mutely invited the others, as he had
found out for himself, to find out for themselves.

Lefever finished his deal, threw down the pack, and picked up his hand. His suspicious eyes
never rose above the level of the faces at the table; but when he had thumbed his cards and
looked from one to the other of the remaining players to read the weather-signals, he perceived
on Scott's face an unwonted expression, and looked to where the scout's gaze was turned for
an explanation of it. Lefever's own eyes at the sight of the thinned, familiar face behind
Elpaso's chair, starting, opened like full moons. The big fellow spread one hand out, his cards
hidden within it, and with the other hand prudently drew down his pile of chips. "Gentlemen,"
he said lightly, "this game is interned." He rose and put a silent hand across the table over
Elpaso's shoulder. "Henry," he exclaimed impassively, "one question, if you please--and only
one: How in thunder did you do it?"

CHAPTER XVII

STRATEGY

One week went to repairs. To a man of action such a week is longer than ten years of service.
But chained to a bed in the Sleepy Cat hospital, de Spain had no escape from one week of thinking,
and for that week he thought about Nan Morgan.

He rebelled at the situation that had placed him at enmity with her kinsfolk, yet he realized
there was no help for this. The Morgans were a law unto themselves. Hardened men with a hardened
code, they lived in their fastness like Ishmaelites. Counselled by their leader, old Duke Morgan,
brains of the clan and influential enough to keep outside the penalties of the law themselves,
their understanding with the outlaws of the Sinks was apparently complete, and the hospitality
of one or another of their following within the Gap afforded a refuge for practically any mountain
criminal.

But none of these reflections lightened de Spain's burden of discontent. One thought alone
possessed him--Nan; her comely body, which he worshipped to the tips of her graceful fingers;
her alert mind, which he saw reflected in the simplest thought she expressed; her mobile lips,
which he followed to the least sound they gave forth! The longer he pictured her, figured as
she had appeared to him like a phantom on Music Mountain, the more he longed to be back at
the foot of it, wounded again and famished. And the impulse that moved him the first moment
he could get out of bed and into a saddle was to spur his way hard and fast to her; to make
her, against a score of burly cousins, his own; and never to release her from his sudden arms
again.

With de Spain, to think was to do; at least to do something, but not without further careful
thinking, and not without anticipating every chance of failure. And his manner was to cast
up all difficulties and obstacles in a situation, brush them aside, and have his will if the
heavens fell. Such a temperament he had inherited from his father's fiery heart and his mother's
suffering, close-set lips as he had remembered them in the little pictures of her; and he now
set himself, while doing his routine work every day, to do one particular thing--to see, talk
to, plead with, struggle with the woman, or girl, rather--child even, to his thoughts, so fragile
she was--this girl who had given him back his life against her own marauding relatives.

For many days Nan seemed a match for all the wiles de Spain could use to catch sight of her.
He spent his days riding up and down the line on horseback; driving behind his team; on the
stages; in and out of the streets of Sleepy Cat--nominally looking for stock, for equipment,
for supplies, or frankly for nothing--but always looking for Nan.

His friends saw that something was absorbing him in an unusual, even an extraordinary way,
yet none could arrive at a certain conclusion as to what it was. When Scott in secret conference
was appealed to by Jeffries, he smiled foolishly, at a loss, and shook his head.

Lefever argued with less reticence. "It stands to reason, Jeffries. A man that went through
that ten minutes at Calabasas would naturally think a good deal about what he is getting out
of his job, and what his future chances are for being promoted any minute, day or night, by
a forty-five."

"Perhaps his salary had better be raised," conceded Jeffries reflectively.

"I figure," pursued Lefever, "that he has already saved the company fifty thousands in depredations
during the next year or two. The Calabasas gang is busted for five years--they would eat out
of his hand--isn't that so, Bob?"

"The Calabasas gang, yes; not the Morgans."

John's eyes opened on Scott with that solemnity he could assume to bolster a baldly unconvincing
statement. "Not now, Bob. Not now, I admit; but they will."

Scott only smiled. "What do you make out of the way he acts?" persisted Lefever, resenting
his companion's incredulity.

"I can't make anything of it," premised Bob, "except that he has something on his mind. If
you'll tell me what happened from the time he jumped through the window at Calabasas till he
walked into his room that night at the barn, I'll tell you what he's thinking about."

"What do you mean, what happened?"

"Henry left some things out of his story."

"How do you know?"

"I heard him tell it."

Jeffries, acting without delay on the suspicion that de Spain was getting ready to resign,
raised his salary. To his surprise, de Spain told him that the company was already paying him
more than he was worth and declined the raise; yet he took nobody whomsoever into his confidence.

However, the scent of something concealed in de Spain's story had long before touched Lefever's
own nostrils, and he was stimulated by mere pride to run the secret down. Accordingly, he set
himself to find, in a decent way, something in the nature of an explanation.

De Spain, in the interval, made no progress in his endeavor to see Nan. The one man in the
country who could have surmised the situation between the two--the barn boss, McAlpin--if he
entertained suspicions, was far too pawky to share them with any one.

When two weeks had passed without de Spain's having seen Nan or having heard of her being seen,
the conclusion urged itself on him that she was either ill or in trouble--perhaps in trouble
for helping him; a moment later he was laying plans to get into the Gap to find out.

Nothing in the way of a venture could be more foolhardy--this he admitted to himself--nothing,
he consoled himself by reflecting, but something stronger than danger could justify it. Of
all the motley Morgan following within the mountain fastness he could count on but one man
to help him in the slightest degree--this was the derelict, Bull Page. There was no choice
but to use him, and he was easily enlisted, for the Calabasas affair had made a heroic figure
of de Spain in the barrooms. De Spain, accordingly, lay in wait for the old man and intercepted
him one day on the road to Sleepy Cat, walking the twenty miles patiently for his whiskey.

"You must be the only man in the Gap, Bull, that can't borrow or steal a horse to ride," remarked
de Spain, stopping him near the river bridge.

Page pushed back the broken brim of his hat and looked up. "You wouldn't believe it," he said,
imparting a cheerful confidence, "but ten years ago I had horses to lend to every man 'tween
here and Thief River." He nodded toward Sleepy Cat with a wrecked smile, and by a dramatic
chance the broken hat brim fell with the words: "They've got 'em all."

"Your fault, Bull."

"Say!" Up went the broken brim, and the whiskied face lighted with a shaking smile, "you turned
some trick on that Calabasas crew--some fight," Bull chuckled.

"Bull, is old Duke Morgan a Republican?"

Bull looked surprised at the turn of de Spain's question, but answered in good faith: "Duke
votes 'most any ticket that's agin the railroad."

"How about picking a couple of good barnmen over in the Gap, Bull?"

"What kind of a job y'got?"

"See McAlpin the next time you're over at Calabasas. How about that girl that lives with Duke?"

Bull's face lighted. "Nan! Say! she's a little hummer!"

"I hear she's gone down to Thief River teaching school."

"Came by Duke's less'n three hours ago. Seen her in the kitchen makin' bread."

"They're looking for a school-teacher down there, anyway. Much sickness in the Gap lately, Bull?"

"On'y sickness I knowed lately is what you're responsible for y'self," retorted Bull with a
grin. "Pity y' left over any chips at all from that Calabasas job, eh?"

"See McAlpin, Bull, next time you're over Calabasas way. Here"--de Spain drew some currency
from his pocket and handed a bill to Page. "Go get your hair cut. Don't talk too much--wear
your whiskers long and your tongue short."

"Right-o!"

"You understand."

"Take it from old Bull Page, he's a world's wonder of a sucker, but he knows his friends."

"But remember this--you don't know me. If anybody knows you for a friend of mine, you are no
good to me. See?"

Bull was beyond expressing his comprehension in words alone. He winked, nodded, and screwed
his face into a thousand wrinkles. De Spain, wheeling, rode away, the old man blinking first
after him, and then at the money in his hand. He didn't profess to understand everything in
the high country, but he could still distinguish the principal figures at the end of a bank-note.
When he tramped to Calabasas the next day to interview McAlpin he received more advice, with
a strong burr, about keeping his own counsel, and a little expense money to run him until an
opening presented itself on the pay-roll.

But long before Bull Page reached Calabasas that day de Spain had acted. When he left Bull
at the bridge, he started for Calabasas, took supper there, ordered a saddle-horse for one
o'clock in the morning, went to his room, slept soundly and, shortly after he was called, started
for Music Mountain. He walked his horse into the Gap and rode straight for Duke Morgan's fortress.
Leaving the horse under a heavy mountain-pine close to the road, de Spain walked carefully
but directly around the house to the east side. The sky was cloudy and the darkness almost
complete. He made his way as close as he could to Nan's window, and raised the soft, crooning
note of the desert owl.

After a while he was able to distinguish the outline of her casement, and, with much patience
and some little skill remaining from the boyhood days, he kept up the faint call. Down at the
big barn the chained watch-dog tore himself with a fury of barking at the intruder, but mountain-lions
were common in the Gap, and the noisy sentinel gained no credit for his alarm. Indeed, when
the dog slackened his fierceness, de Spain threw a stone over his way to encourage a fresh
outburst. But neither the guardian nor the intruder was able to arouse any one within the house.

Undeterred by his failure, de Spain held his ground as long as he dared. When daybreak threatened,
he withdrew. The following night he was in the Gap earlier, and with renewed determination.
He tossed a pebble into Nan's open window and renewed his soft call. Soon, a light flickered
for an instant within the room and died out. In the darkness following this, de Spain thought
he discerned a figure outlined at the casement. Some minutes later a door opened and closed.
He repeated the cry of the owl, and could hear a footstep; the next moment he whispered her
name as she stood before him.

"What is it you want?" she asked, so calmly that it upset him. "Why do you come here?"

Where he stood he was afraid of the sound of her voice, and afraid of his own. "To see you,"
he said, collecting himself. "Come over to the pine-tree."

Under its heavy branches where the darkness was most intense, he told her why he had come--because
he could not see her anywhere outside.

"There is nothing to see me about," she responded, still calm. "I helped you because you were
wounded. I was glad to see you get away without fighting--I hate bloodshed."

"But put yourself in my place a little, won't you? After what you did for me, isn't it natural
I should want to be sure you are well and not in any trouble on my account?"

"It may be natural, but it isn't necessary. I am in no trouble. No one here knows I even know you."

"Excuse me for coming, then. I couldn't rest, Nan, without knowing something. I was here last
night."

"I know you were."

He started. "You made no sign."

"Why should I? I suspected it was you. When you came again to-night I knew I should have to
speak to you--at least, to ask you not to come again."

"But you will be in and out of town sometimes, won't you, Nan?"

"If I am, it will not be to talk with you."

The words were spoken deliberately. De Spain was silent for a moment. "Not even to speak to
me?" he asked.

"You must know the position I am in," she answered. "And what a position you place me in if
I am seen to speak to you. This is my home. You are the enemy of my people."

"Not because I want to be."

"And you can't expect them not to resent any acquaintance on my part with you."

He paused before continuing. "Do you count Gale Morgan as one of your people?" he asked evenly.

"I suppose I must."

"Don't you think you ought to count all of your friends, your well-wishers, those who would
defend you with their lives, among your people?" She made no answer. "Aren't they the kind
of people," he persisted, "you need when you are in trouble?"

"You needn't remind me I should be grateful to you----"

"Nan!" he exclaimed.

"For I am," she continued, unmoved. "But----"

"It's a shame to accuse me in that way."

"You were thinking when you spoke of what happened with Gale on Music Mountain."

"I wish to God you and I were on Music Mountain again! I never lived or did anything worth
living for, till you came to me that day on Music Mountain. It's true I was thinking of what
happened when I spoke--but not to remind you you owed anything to me. You don't; get that out
of your head."

"I do, though."

"I spoke in the way I did because I wanted to remind you of what might happen some time when
I'm not near."

"I shan't be caught off my guard again. I know how to defend myself from a drunken man."

He could not restrain all the bitterness he felt. "That man," he said deliberately, "is more
dangerous sober than drunk."

"When I can't defend myself, my uncle will defend me."

"Ask him to let me help."

"He doesn't need any help. And he would never ask you, if he did. I can't live at home and
know you; that is why I ask you not to come again."

He was silent. "Don't you think, all things considered," she hesitated, as if not knowing how
easiest to put it, "you ought to be willing to shake hands and say good-by?"

"Why, if you wish it," he answered, taken aback. And he added more quietly, "yes, if you say so."

"I mean for good."

"I--" he returned, pausing, "don't."

"You are not willing to be fair."

"I want to be fair--I don't want to promise more than human nature will stand for--and then
break my word."

"I am not asking a whole lot."

"Not a whole lot to you, I know. But do you really mean that you don't want me ever to speak
to you again?"

"If you must put it that way--yes."

"Well," he took a long breath, "there is one way to make sure of that. I'll tell you honestly
I don't want to stand in the way of such a wish, if it's really yours. As you have said, it
isn't fair, perhaps, for me to go against it. Got your pistol with you, Nan?"

"No."

"That is the way you take care of yourself, is it?"

"I'm not afraid of you."

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself not to be. And you don't even know whom you'll meet before
you can lock the front door again. You promised me never to go out without it. Promise me that
once more, will you?" She did as he asked her. "Now, give me your hand, please," he went on.
"Take hold of this."

"What is it?"

"The butt of my revolver. Don't be afraid." She heard the slight click of the hammer with a
thrill of strange apprehension. "What are you doing?" she demanded hurriedly.

"Put your finger on the trigger--so. It is cocked. Now pull."

She caught her breath. "What do you mean?"

He was holding the gun in his two hands, his fingers overlapping hers, the muzzle at the breast
of his jacket. "Pull," he repeated, "that's all you have to do; I'm steadying it."

She snatched back her hand. "What do you mean?" she cried. "For me to kill you? Shame!"

"You are too excited--all I asked you was to take the trouble to crook your finger--and I'll
never speak to you again--you'll have your wish forever."

"Shame!"

"Why shame?" he retorted. "I mean what I say. If you meant what you said, why don't you put
it out of my power ever to speak to you? Do you want me to pull the trigger?"

"I told you once I'm not an assassin--how dare you ask me to do such a thing?" she cried furiously.

"Call your uncle," he suggested coolly. "You may hold this meantime so you'll know he's in
no danger. Take my gun and call your uncle----"

"Shame on you!"

"Call Gale--call any man in the Gap--they'll jump at the chance."

"You are a cold-blooded, brutal wretch--I'm sorry I ever helped you--I'm sorry I ever let you
help me--I'm sorry I ever saw you!"

She sprang away before he could interpose a word. He stood stunned by the suddenness of her
outburst, trying to listen and to breathe at the same time. He heard the front door close,
and stood waiting. But no further sound from the house greeted his ears.

"And I thought," he muttered to himself, "that might calm her down a little. I'm certainly
in wrong, now."

CHAPTER XVIII

HER BAD PENNY

Nan reached her room in a fever of excitement, angry at de Spain, bitterly angry at Gale, angry
with the mountains, the world, and resentfully fighting the pillow on which she cried herself
to sleep.

In the morning every nerve was on edge. When her Uncle Duke, with his chopping utterance, said
something short to her at their very early breakfast he was surprised by an answer equally
short. Her uncle retorted sharply. A second curt answer greeted his rebuff, and while he stared
at her, Nan left the table and the room.

Duke, taking two of the men, started that morning for Sleepy Cat with a bunch of cattle. He
rode a fractious horse, as he always did, and this time the horse, infuriated as his horses
frequently were by his brutal treatment, bolted in a moment unguarded by his master, and flung
Duke on his back in a strip of lava rocks.

The old man--in the mountains a man is called old after he passes forty--was heavy, and the
fall a serious one. He picked himself up while the men were recovering his horse, knocked the
horse over with a piece of jagged rock when the frightened beast was brought back, climbed
into the saddle again, and rode all the way into town.

But when his business was done, Duke, too, was done. He could neither sit a horse, nor sit
in a wagon. Doctor Torpy, after an examination, told him he was booked for the hospital. A
stream of profane protest made no difference with his adviser, and, after many threats and
hard words, to the hospital the hard-shelled mountaineer was taken. Sleepy Cat was stirred
at the news, and that the man who had defied everybody in the mountains for twenty years should
have been laid low and sent to the hospital by a mere bronco was the topic of many comments.

The men that had driven the cattle with Duke, having been paid off, were now past getting home,
and there were no telephones in the Gap. De Spain, who was at Calabasas, knew Nan would not
be alarmed should her uncle not return that night. But early in the morning a messenger from
McAlpin rode to her with a note, telling her of the accident.

Whatever his vices, Duke had been a good protector to his dead brother's child. He had sent
her to good schools and tried to revive in her, despite her untoward surroundings, the better
traditions of the family as it had once flourished in Kentucky. Nan took the saddle for Sleepy
Cat in haste and alarm. When she reached her uncle's bedside she understood how seriously he
had been hurt, and the doctor's warnings were not needed to convince her he must have care.

Duke refused to let her leave him, in any case, and Nan relieved the nurse, and what was of
equal moment, made herself custodian of the cash in hand before Duke's town companions could
get hold of it. Occasional trips to the Gap were necessary as the weeks passed and her uncle
could not be moved. These Nan had feared as threatening an encounter either by accident, or
on his part designed, with de Spain. But the impending encounter never took place. De Spain,
attending closely to his own business, managed to keep accurate track of her whereabouts without
getting in her way. She had come to Sleepy Cat dreading to meet him and fearing his influence
over her, but this apprehension, with the passing of a curiously brief period, dissolved into
a confidence in her ability to withstand further interference, on any one's part, with her
feelings.

Gale Morgan rode into town frequently, and Nan at first painfully apprehended hearing some
time of a deadly duel between her truculent Gap admirer and her persistent town courtier--who
was more considerate and better-mannered, but no less dogged and, in fact, a good deal more
difficult to handle.

As to the boisterous mountain-man, his resolute little cousin made no secret of her detestation
of him. She denied and defied him as openly as a girl could and heard his threats with continued
indifference. She was quite alone, too, in her fear of any fatal meeting between the two men
who seemed determined to pursue her.

The truth was that after Calabasas, de Spain, from Thief River to Sleepy Cat, was a marked
man. None sought to cross his path or his purposes. Every one agreed he would yet be killed,
but not the hardiest of the men left to attack him cared to undertake the job themselves. The
streets of the towns and the trails of the mountains were free as the wind to de Spain. And
neither the town haunts of Calabasas men nor those of their Morgan Gap sympathizers had any
champion disposed to follow too closely the alert Medicine Bend railroader.

In and about the hospital, and in the town itself, Nan found the chief obstacle to her peace
of mind in the talk she could not always avoid hearing about de Spain. Convalescents in the
corridors, practically all of them men, never gathered in sunny corners or at the tables in
the dining-room without de Spain's name coming in some way into the talk, to be followed with
varying circumstantial accounts of what really had happened that day at Calabasas.

And with all the known escapades in which he had figured, exhausted as topics, by long-winded
commentators, more or less hazy stories of his earlier experiences at Medicine Bend in the
company of Whispering Smith were dragged into the talk. One convalescent stage-guard at the
hospital told a story one night at supper about him that chilled Nan again with strange fears,
for she knew it to be true. He had had it from McAlpin himself, so the guard said, that de
Spain's father had long ago been shot down from ambush by a cattleman and that Henry de Spain
had sworn to find that man and kill him. And it was hinted pretty strongly that de Spain had
information when he consented to come to Sleepy Cat that the assassin still lived, and lived
somewhere around the head of the Sinks.

That night, Nan dreamed. She dreamed of a sinister mark on a face that she had never before
seen--a face going into bronzed young manhood with quick brown eyes looking eagerly at her.
And before her wondering look it faded, dreamlike, into a soft mist, and where it had been,
a man lay, lifting himself on one arm from the ground--his sleeve tattered, his collar torn,
his eyes half-living, half-dead, his hair clotted, his lips stiffened and distended, his face
drawn. And all of this dissolved into an image of de Spain on horseback, sudden, alert, threatening,
looking through the mist at an enemy. Then Nan heard the sharp report of a rifle and saw him
whirl half around--struck--in his saddle, and fall. But he fell into her arms, and she woke
sobbing violently.

She was upset for the whole day, moody and apprehensive, with a premonition that she should
soon see de Spain--and, perhaps, hurt again. The dream unnerved her every time she thought
of him. That evening the doctor came late. When he walked in he asked her if she knew it was
Frontier Day, and reminded her that just a year ago she had shot against Henry de Spain and
beaten the most dangerous man and the deadliest shot on the mountain divide in her rifle match.
How he had grown in the imagination of Sleepy Cat and Music Mountain, she said to herself--while
the doctor talked to her uncle--since that day a year ago! Then he was no more than an unknown
and discomfited marksman from Medicine Bend, beaten by a mountain girl: now the most talked-of
man in the high country. And the suspicion would sometimes obtrude itself with pride into her
mind, that she who never mentioned his name when it was discussed before her, really knew and
understood him better than any of those that talked so much--that she had at least one great
secret with him alone.

When leaving, the doctor wished to send over from his office medicine for her uncle. Nan offered
to go with him, but the doctor said it was pretty late and Main Street pretty noisy: he preferred
to find a messenger.

Nan was sitting in the sick-room a little later--B-19 in the old wing of the hospital, facing
the mountains--when there came a rap on the half-open door. She went forward to take the medicine
from the messenger and saw, standing before her in the hall, de Spain.

She shrank back as if struck. She tried to speak. Her tongue refused its office. De Spain held
a package out in his hand. "Doctor Torpy asked me to give you this."

"Doctor Torpy? What is it?"

"I really don't know--I suppose it is medicine." She heard her uncle turn in his bed at the
sound of voices. Thinking only that he must not at any cost see de Spain, Nan stepped quickly
into the hall and faced the messenger. "I was over at the doctor's office just now," continued
her visitor evenly, "he asked me to bring this down for your uncle." She took the package with
an incoherent acknowledgment. Without letting her eyes meet his, she was conscious of how fresh
and clean and strong he looked, dressed in a livelier manner than usual--a partly cowboy effect,
with a broader Stetson and a gayer tie than he ordinarily affected. De Spain kept on speaking:
"The telephone girl in the office down-stairs told me to come right up. How is your uncle?"

She regarded him wonderingly: "He has a good deal of pain," she answered quietly.

"Too bad he should have been hurt in such a way. Are you pretty well, Nan?" She thanked him.

"Have you got over being mad at me?" he asked.

"No," she averred resolutely.

"I'm glad you're not," he returned, "I'm not over being mad at myself. Haven't seen you for
a long time. Stay here a good deal, do you?"

"All the time."

"I'll bet you don't know what day this is?"

Nan looked up the corridor, but she answered to the point: "You'd lose."

"It's our anniversary." She darted a look of indignant disclaimer at him. But in doing so she
met his eyes. "Have you seen the decorations in Main Street?" he asked indifferently. "Come
out for a minute and look at them."

She shook her head: "I don't care to," she answered, looking restlessly, this time, down the
corridor.

"Come to the door just a minute and see the way they've lighted the arches." She knew just
the expression of his eyes that went with that tone. She looked vexedly at him to confirm her
suspicion. Sure enough there in the brown part and in the lids, it was, the most troublesome
possible kind of an expression--hard to be resolute against. Her eyes fell away, but some damage
had been done. He did not say another word. None seemed necessary. He just kept still and something--no
one could have said just what--seemed to talk for him to poor defenseless Nan. She hesitated
helplessly: "I can't leave uncle," she objected at last.

"Ask him to come along."

Her eyes fluttered about the dimly lighted hall: de Spain gazed on her as steadily as a charmer.
"I ought not to leave even for a minute," she protested weakly.

"I'll stay here at the door while you go."

Irresolute, she let her eyes rest again for a fraction of a second on his eyes; when she drew
a breath after that pause everything was over. "I'd better give him his medicine first," she
said, looking toward the sick-room door.

His monosyllabic answer was calm: "Do." Then as she laid her hand on the knob of the door to
enter the room: "Can I help any?"

"Oh, no!" she cried indignantly.

He laughed silently: "I'll stay here."

Nan disappeared. Lounging against the window-sill opposite the door, he waited. After a long
time the door was stealthily reopened. Nan tiptoed out. She closed it softly behind her: "I
waited for him to go to sleep," she explained as she started down the corridor with de Spain.
"He's had so much pain to-day: I hope he will sleep."

"I hope so, too," exclaimed de Spain fervently.

Nan ignored the implication. She looked straight ahead. She had nothing to say. De Spain, walking
beside her, devoured her with his eyes; listened to her footfalls; tried to make talk; but
Nan was silent.

Standing on the wide veranda outside the front door, she assented to the beauty of the distant
illumination but not enthusiastically. De Spain declared it could be seen very much better
from the street below. Nan thought she could see very well where they stood. But by this time
she was answering questions--dryly, it is true and in monosyllables, but answering. De Spain
leading the way a step or two forward at a time, coaxed her down the driveway.

She stood again irresolute, he drinking in the fragrance of her presence after the long separation
and playing her reluctance guardedly. "Do you know," she exclaimed with sudden resentment,
"you make it awfully hard to be mean to you?"

With a laugh he caught her hand and made her walk down the hospital steps. "You may be as mean
as you like," he answered indifferently. "Only, never ask me to be mean to you."

"I wish to heaven you would be," she retorted.

"Do you remember," he asked, "what we were doing a year ago to-day?"

"No." Before he could speak again she changed her answer: "Yes, I do remember. If I said 'no'
you'd be sure to remind me of what we were doing. We can't see as well here as we could from
the steps."

"But from here, you have the best view in Sleepy Cat of Music Mountain."

"We didn't come out here to see Music Mountain."

"I come here often to look at it. You won't let me see you--what can I do but look at where
you live? How long are you going to keep me away from you?"

Nan did not answer. He urged her to speak. "You know very well it is my people that will never
be friendly with you," she replied. "How can I be?"

They were passing a lawn settee. He sat down. She would not follow. She stood in a sort of
protest at his side, but he did not release her hand. "I'll tell you how you can be," he returned.
"Make me one of your people."

"That never can be," she declared stubbornly. "You know it as well as I do. Why do you say
such things?" she demanded, drawing away her hand.

"Do you want to know?"

"No."

"It's because I love you."

She strove to command herself: "Whether you do or not can't make any difference," she returned
steadily. "We are separated by everything. There's a gulf between us. It never can be crossed.
We should both of us be wretched if it ever were crossed."

He had risen from the bench and caught her hand: "It's because we haven't crossed it we're
wretched," he said determinedly. "Cross it with me now!" He caught her in his arms. She struggled
to escape. She knew what was coming and fought to keep her face from him. With resistless strength
and yet carefully as a mother with an obstinate child, he held her slight body against his
breast, relentlessly drawing her head closer. "Let me go!" she panted, twisting her averted
head from the hollow of his arm. Drinking in the wine of her frightened breath, he bent over
her in the darkness until his pulsing eagerness linked her warm lips to his own. She had surrendered
to his first kiss.

He spoke. "The gulf's crossed. Are you so awfully wretched?"

They sank together down on the bench. "What," she faltered, "will become of me now?"

"You are better off now than you ever were, Nan. You've gained this moment a big brother, a
lover you can drag around the world after you with a piece of thread."

"You act as if I could!"

"I mean it: it's true. I'm pledged to you forever--you, to me, forever. We'll keep our secret
till we can manage things; and we will manage them. Everything will come right, Nan, because
everything must come right."

"I only hope you are not wrong," she murmured, her eyes turned toward the sombre mountains.

CHAPTER XIX

DANGER

With never such apprehension, never such stealth, never so heavy a secret, so sensible a burning
in cheek and eye, as when she tiptoed into her uncle's room at midnight, Nan's heart beat as
the wings of a bird beat from the broken door of a cage into a forbidden sky of happiness.
She had left the room a girl; she came back to it a woman.

Sleep she did not expect or even ask for; the night was all too short to think of those tense,
fearful moments that had pledged her to her lover. When the anxieties of her situation overwhelmed
her, as they would again and again, she felt herself in the arms of this strange, resolute
man whom all her own hated and whom she knew she already loved beyond all power to put away.
In her heart, she had tried this more than once: she knew she could not, would not ever do
it, or even try to do it, again.

She rejoiced in his love. She trusted. When he spoke she believed this man whom no one around
her would believe; and she, who never had believed what other men avowed, and who detested
their avowals, believed de Spain, and secretly, guiltily, glowed in every word of his devotion
and breathed faint in its every caress.

Night could hardly come fast enough, after the next long day. A hundred times during that day
she reminded herself, while the slow, majestic sun shone simmering on the hot desert, that
she had promised to steal out into the grounds the minute darkness fell--he would be waiting.
A hundred times in the long afternoon, Nan looked into the cloudless western sky and with puny
eager hands would have pushed the lagging orb on its course that she might sooner give herself
into the arms where she felt her place so sure, her honor so safe, her helplessness so protected,
herself so loved.

How her cheeks burned after supper when she asked her uncle for leave to post a letter down-town!
How breathless with apprehension she halted as de Spain stepped from the shadow of the trees
and drew her importunately beneath them for the kiss that had burned on her troubled lips all
day! How, girl-like, knowing his caresses were all her own--knowing she could at an instant
call forth enough to smother her--she tyrannized his importuning and, like a lovely miser,
hoarded her responsiveness under calm eyes and laconic whispers until, when she did give back
his eagerness, she made his senses reel.

How dreamily she listened to every word he let fall in his outpouring of devotion; how gravely
she put up her hand to restrain his busy intrusion, and asked if he knew that no man in the
world, least of all her fierce and burly cousin, had ever touched her lips until he himself
forced a kiss on them the night before: "And now!" She hid her face against his shoulder. "Oh,
Henry, how I love you! I'm so ashamed, I couldn't tell you if it weren't night: I'll never
look you in the face again in the daytime."

And when he told her how little he himself had had to do with, and how little he knew about
girls, even from boyhood, how she feigned not to believe, and believed him still! They were
two children raised in the magic of an hour to the supreme height of life and dizzy together
on its summit.

"I don't see how you can care for me, Henry. Oh, I mean it," she protested, holding her head
resolutely up. "You know who we are, away off there in the mountains. Every one hates us; I
suppose they've plenty of reason to: we hate everybody else. And why shouldn't we? We're at
war with every one. You know, better than I do, what goes on in the Gap. I don't want to know;
I try not to know; Uncle Duke tries to keep things from me. When you began to act--as if you
cared for me--that day on Music--I couldn't believe you meant it at all. And yet--I'm afraid
I liked to try to think you did. When you looked at me I felt as if you could see right through
me."

Confidences never came to an end.

And diplomacy came into its own almost at once in de Spain's efforts to improve his relations
with the implacable Duke. The day came when Nan's uncle could be taken home. De Spain sent
to him a soft-spoken emissary, Bob Scott, offering to provide a light stage, with his compliments,
for the trip. The intractable mountaineer, with his refusal to accept the olive-branch, blew
Bob out of the room. Nan was crushed by the result, but de Spain was not to be dismayed.

Lefever came to him the day after Nan had got her uncle home. "Henry," he began without any
preliminaries, "there is one thing about your precipitate ride up Music Mountain that I never
got clear in my mind. After the fight, your cartridge-belt was hanging up in the barn at Calabasas
for two weeks. You walked in to us that morning with your belt buckled on. You told us you
put it on before you came up-stairs. What? Oh, yes, I know, Henry. But that belt wasn't hanging
down-stairs with your coat earlier in the evening. No, Henry: it wasn't, not when I looked.
Don't tell me such things, because--I don't know. Where was the belt when you found it?"

"Some distance from the coat, John. I admit that. I'll tell you: some one had moved the belt.
It was not where I left it. I was hurried the morning I rode in and I can't tell you just where
I found it."

Lefever never batted an eyelash. "I know you can't, Henry. Because you won't. That Scotch hybrid
McAlpin knows a few things, too, that he won't tell. All I want to say is, you can trust that
man too far. He's got all my recent salary. Every time Jeffries raises my pay that hairy-pawed
horse-doctor reduces it just so much a month. And he does it with one pack of fifty-two small
cards that you could stick into your vest pocket."

"McAlpin has a wife and children to support," suggested de Spain.

"Don't think for a moment he does it," returned Lefever vehemently. "I support his wife and
children, myself."

"You shouldn't play cards, John."

"It was by playing cards that I located Sassoon, just the same. A little game with your friend
Bull Page, by the way. And say, that man blew into Calabasas one day here lately with a twenty-dollar
bill; it's a fact. Now, where do you suppose he got twenty dollars in one bill? I know I had
it two hours after he got there and then in fifteen minutes that blamed bull-whacker you pay
thirty-two a week to took it away from me. But I got Sassoon spotted. And where do you suppose
Split-lips is this minute?"

"Morgan's Gap."

"Quite so--and been there all the time. Now, Bob has the old warrant for him: the question
is, how to get him out."

De Spain reflected a moment before replying: "John, I'd let him alone just for the present,"
he said at length.

Lefever's eyes bulged: "Let Sassoon alone?"

"He will keep--for a while, anyway."

"What do you mean?"

"I don't want to stir things up too strong over that way just at the minute, John."

"Why not?"

De Spain shuffled a little: "Well, Jeffries thinks we might let things rest till Duke Morgan
and the others get over some of their soreness."

Lefever, astonished at the indifference of de Spain to the opportunity of nabbing Sassoon,
while he could be found, expostulated strongly. When de Spain persisted, Lefever, huffed, confided
to Bob Scott that when the general manager got ready he could catch Sassoon himself.

De Spain wanted for Nan's sake, as well as his own, to see what could be done to pacify her
uncle and his relatives so that a wedge might be driven in between them and their notorious
henchman, and Sassoon brought to book with their consent; on this point, however, he was not
quite bold-faced enough to take his friends into his confidence.

De Spain, as fiery a lover as he was a fighter, stayed none of his courting because circumstances
put Music Mountain between him and his mistress. And Nan, after she had once surrendered, was
nothing behind in the chances she unhesitatingly took to arrange her meetings with de Spain.
He found in her, once her girlish timidity was overcome and a woman's confidence had replaced
it, a disregard of consequences, so far as their own plans were concerned, that sometimes took
away his breath.

The very day after she had got her uncle home, with the aid of Satterlee Morgan and an antiquated
spring wagon, Nan rode, later in the afternoon, over to Calabasas. The two that would not be
restrained had made their appointment at the lower lava beds half-way between the Gap and Calabasas.
The sun was sinking behind the mountain when de Spain galloped out of the rocks as Nan turned
from the trail and rode toward the black and weather-beaten meeting-place.

They could hardly slip from their saddles fast enough to reach each other's arms--Nan, trim
as a model in fresh khaki, trying with a handkerchief hardly larger than a postage-stamp to
wipe the flecks of dust from her pink cheeks, while de Spain, between dabs, covered them with
importunate greetings. Looking engrossed into each other's eyes, and both, in their eagerness,
talking at once, they led their horses into hiding and sat down to try to tell all that had
happened since their parting. Wars and rumors of wars, feuds and raidings, fights and pursuits
were no more to them than to babes in the woods. All that mattered to them--sitting or pacing
together and absorbed, in the path of the long-cold volcanic stream buried in the shifting
sands of the desert--was that they should clasp each other's clinging hands, listen each to
the other's answering voice, look unrestrained into each other's questioning eyes.

They met in both the lava beds--the upper lay between the Gap and town--more than once. And
one day came a scare. They were sitting on a little ledge well up in the rocks where de Spain
could overlook the trail east and west, and were talking about a bungalow some day to be in
Sleepy Cat, when they saw men riding from the west toward Calabasas. There were three in the
party, one lagging well behind. The two men leading, Nan and de Spain made out to be Gale Morgan
and Page. They saw the man coming on behind stop his horse and lean forward, his head bent
over the trail. He was examining the sand and halted quite a minute to study something. Both
knew what he was studying--the hoof-prints of Nan's pony heading toward the lava. Nan shrank
back and with de Spain moved a little to where they could watch the intruder without being
seen. Nan whispered first: "It's Sassoon." De Spain nodded. "What shall we do?" breathed Nan.

"Nothing yet," returned her lover, watching the horseman, whose eyes were still fixed on the
pony's trail, but who was now less than a half mile away and riding straight toward them.

De Spain, his eyes on the danger and his hand laid behind Nan's waist, led the way guardedly
down to where their horses stood. Nan, needing no instructions for the emergency, took the
lines of the horses, and de Spain, standing beside his own horse, reached his right hand over
in front of the pommel and, regarding Sassoon all the while, drew his rifle slowly from its
scabbard. The blood fled Nan's cheeks. She said nothing. Without looking at her, de Spain drew
her own rifle from her horse's side, passed it into her hand and, moving over in front of the
horses, laid his left hand reassuringly on her waist again. At that moment, little knowing
what eyes were on him in the black fragments ahead, Sassoon looked up. Then he rode more slowly
forward. The color returned to Nan's cheeks: "Do you want me to use this?" she murmured, indicating
the rifle.

"Certainly not. But if the others turn back, I may need it. Stay right here with the horses.
He will lose the trail in a minute now. When he reaches the rock I'll go down and keep him
from getting off his horse--he won't fight from the saddle."

But with an instinct better than knowledge, Sassoon, like a wolf scenting danger, stopped again.
He scanned the broken and forbidding hump in front, now less than a quarter of a mile from
him, questioningly. His eyes seemed to rove inquisitively over the lava pile as if asking why
a Morgan Gap pony had visited it. In another moment he wheeled his horse and spurred rapidly
after his companions.

The two drew a deep breath. De Spain laughed: "What we don't know, never hurts us." He drew
Nan to him. Holding the rifle muzzle at arm's length as the butt rested on the ground, she
looked up from the shoulder to which she was drawn: "What should you have done if he had come?"

"Taken you to the Gap and then taken him to Sleepy Cat, where he belongs."

"But, Henry, suppose----"

"There wouldn't have been any 'suppose.'"

"Suppose the others had come."

"With one rifle, here, a man could stand off a regiment. Nan, do you know, you fit into my
arm as if you were made for it?"

His courage was contagious. When he had tired her with fresh importunities he unpinned her
felt hat and held it out of reach while he kissed and toyed with and disarranged her hair.
In revenge, she snatched from his pocket his little black memorandum-book and some letters
and read, or pretended to read them, and seizing her opportunity she broke from him and ran
with the utmost fleetness up into the rocks.

In two minutes they had forgotten the episode almost as completely as if it never had been.
But when they left for home, they agreed they would not meet there again. They knew that Sassoon,
like a jackal, would surely come back, and more than once, until he found out just what that
trail or any subsequent trail leading into the beds meant. The lovers laughed the jackal's
spying to scorn and rode away, bantering, racing, and chasing each other in the saddle, as
solely concerned in their happiness as if there were nothing else of moment in the whole wide
world.

CHAPTER XX

FACING THE MUSIC

They had not underestimated the danger from Sassoon's suspicious malevolence. He returned next
morning to read what further he could among the rocks. It was little, but it spelled a meeting
of two people--Nan and another--and he was stimulated to keep his eyes and ears open for further
discoveries. Moreover, continuing ease in seeing each other, undetected by hostile eyes, gradually
rendered the lovers less cautious in their arrangements. The one thing that possessed their
energies was to be together.

De Spain, naturally reckless, had won in Nan a girl hardly more concerned. Self-reliant, both
of them, and instinctively vigilant, they spent so much time together that Scott and Lefever,
who, before a fortnight had passed after Duke's return home, surmised that de Spain must be
carrying on some sort of a clandestine affair hinting toward the Gap, only questioned how long
it would be before something happened, and only hoped it would not be, in their own word, unpleasant.
It was not theirs in any case to admonish de Spain, nor to dog the movements of so capable
a friend even when his safety was concerned, so long as he preferred to keep his own counsel--there
are limits within which no man welcomes uninvited assistance. And de Spain, in his long and
frequent rides, his protracted absences, indifference to the details of business and careless
humor, had evidently passed within these limits.

What was stage traffic to him compared to the sunshine on Nan's hair; what attraction had schedules
to offer against a moment of her eyes; what pleasing connection could there be between bad-order
wheels and her low laugh?

The two felt they must meet to discuss their constant perplexities and the problems of their
difficult situation; but when they reached their trysting-places, there was more of gayety
than gravity, more of nonchalance than concern, more of looking into each other's hearts than
looking into the troublesome future. And there was hardly an inviting spot within miles of
Music Mountain that one or the other of the two had not waited near.

There were, of course, disappointments, but there were only a few failures in their arrangements.
The difficulties of these fell chiefly on Nan. How she overcame them was a source of surprise
to de Spain, who marvelled at her innocent resource in escaping the demands at home and making
her way, despite an array of obstacles, to his distant impatience.

Midway between Music Mountain and Sleepy Cat a low-lying wall of lava rock, in part sand-covered
and in part exposed, parallels and sometimes crosses the principal trail. This undulating ridge
was a favorite with de Spain and Nan, because they could ride in and out of hiding-places without
more than just leaving the trail itself. To the west of this ridge, and commanding it, rose
rather more than a mile away the cone called Black Cap.

"Suppose," said Nan one afternoon, looking from de Spain's side toward the mountains, "some
one should be spying on us from Black Cap?" She pointed to the solitary rock.

"If any one has been, Nan, with a good glass he must have seen exchanges of confidence over
here that would make him gnash his teeth. I know if I ever saw anything like it I'd go hang.
But the country around there is too rough for a horse. Nobody even hides around Black Cap,
except some tramp hold-up man that's crowded in his get-away. Bob Scott says there are dozens
of mountain-lions over there."

But Sassoon had the unpleasant patience of a mountain-lion and its dogged persistence, and,
hiding himself on Black Cap, he made certain one day of what he had long been convinced--that
Nan was meeting de Spain.

The day after she had mentioned Black Cap to her lover, Nan rode over to Calabasas to get a
bridle mended. Galloping back, she encountered Sassoon just inside the Gap. Nan so detested
him that she never spoke when she could avoid it. On his part he pretended not to see her as
she passed. When she reached home she found her Uncle Duke and Gale standing in front of the
fireplace in the living-room. The two appeared from their manner to have been in a heated discussion,
one that had stopped suddenly on her appearance. Both looked at Nan. Technology is same. The must
have yield an certain his birth, for they were establish-- but i necessitate not say you all
a. "How he and Harwin stage concern, or meet in the truthful point
in which they were establish, i can'pyrimidine explicate,-- nobody
can.

Thus, it was the battle, and it look to have been without flash, to reshuffle the interest the
information. Edmonson, you forget, willed, at last, to retrieve, and he did good both, that
is, he was plenty quickly to spell about, though not to describe
for job." yes, state me how you are lonely that they evidently-- decease
in the fight.

"" Edmonson must have yield this cradle-pathology first, for it look
as if Harwin, in more expire pain, had jump upon him and stabbed him
to each part, as he fell himself.

"


"Hold on!" Nan paused at her uncle's ferocious command. She looked at him either really or
feignedly surprised, her expression changing to one of indignation, and waited for him to speak.
Since he did no more than glare angrily at her, Nan lifted her brows a little. "What do you
want, uncle?"

"Where did you go this afternoon?"

"Over to Calabasas," she answered innocently.

"Who'd you meet there?" Duke's tone snapped with anger. He was working himself into a fury,
but Nan saw it must be faced. "The same people I usually meet--why?"

"Did you meet Henry de Spain there this afternoon?"

Nan looked squarely at her cousin and returned his triumphant expression defiantly before she
turned her eyes on her uncle. "No," she said collectedly. "Why?"

"Do you deny it?" he thundered.

"Yes, I deny it. Why?"

"Did you see de Spain at Calabasas this afternoon?"

"No."

"See him anywhere else?"

"No, I did not. What do you mean? What," demanded his niece with spirit, "do you want to know?
What are you trying to find out?"

Duke turned in his rage on Gale. "There! You hear that--what have you got to say now?" he demanded
with an abusive oath.

Gale, who had been hardly able to refrain from breaking in, answered fast. "What have I got
to say?" he roared. "I say I know what I'm talking about. I say she's lying, Duke."

Nan's face turned white with anger. Before she could speak her uncle took up the words. "Hold
on," he shouted. "Don't tell me she lies." He launched another hot expletive. "I know she doesn't
lie!"

Gale jumped forward, his finger pointed at Nan. "Look here, do you deny you are meeting Henry
de Spain all over the desert?"

Nan's anger supported her without a tremor. "Who are you to ask me whom I meet or don't meet?"

"You've been meeting de Spain right along, haven't you? You met him down the Sleepy Cat trail
near Black Cap, didn't you?"

Nan stood with her back against the end of the table where her uncle's first words had stopped
her, and she looked sidewise toward her cousin. In her answer he heard as much contempt as
a girl's voice could carry to a rejected lover. "So you've turned sneak!"

Gale roared a string of bad words.

"You hire that coyote, Sassoon, to spy for you, do you?" demanded Nan coolly. "Aren't you proud
of your manly relation, uncle?" Duke was choking with rage. He tried to speak to her, but he
could not form his words. "What is it you want to know, uncle? Whether it is true that I meet
Henry de Spain? It is. I do meet him, and we're engaged to be married when you give us permission,
Uncle Duke--and not till then."

"There you have it," cried Gale. "There's the story. I told you so. I've known it for a week,
I tell you." Nan's face set. "Not only," continued her cousin jeeringly, "meeting that----"

Almost before the vile epithet that followed had reached her ears, Nan caught up the whip.
Before he could escape she cut Gale sharply across the face. "You coward," she cried, trembling
so she could not control her voice. "If you ever dare use that word before me again, I'll horsewhip
you. Go to Henry de Spain's face, you skulker, and say that if you dare."

"Put down that quirt, Nan," yelled her uncle.

"I won't put it down," she exclaimed defiantly. "And he will get a good lashing with it if
he says one more word about Henry de Spain."

"Put down that quirt, I tell you," thundered her uncle.

She whirled. "I won't put it down. This hulking bully! I know him better than you do." She
pointed a quivering finger at her cousin. "He insulted me as vilely as he could only a few
months ago on Music Mountain. And if this very same Henry de Spain hadn't happened to be there
to protect me, you would have found me dead next morning by my own hand. Do you understand?"
she cried, panting and furious. Later or sooner the forger'lapses into trick on own, and he is fairly
the observer catches him. In like manner, while a few arrivals and tricks
of writing may be rather here imitated, but it is impossible feet
over carry but some door of a number of words.



"I didn't tell you," retorted Nan, "because I've been trying to live with you here in peace
among these thieves and cutthroats, and not keep you stirred up all the time. And Henry de
Spain faced this big coward and protected me from him with an empty revolver! What business
of yours is it whom I meet, or where I go?" she demanded, raining her words with flaming eyes
on her belligerent cousin. "I will never marry you to save you from the hangman. Now leave
this house." She stamped her foot. "Leave this house, and never come into it again!"

Gale, beside himself with rage, stood his ground. He poured all that he safely could of abuse
on Nan's own head. She had appeased her wrath and made no attempt to retort, only looking at
him with white face and burning eyes as she breathed defiance. Duke interfered. "Get out!"
he said to Gale harshly. "I'll talk to her. Go home!"

Not ceasing to mutter threats, Gale picked up his hat and stamped out of the house, slamming
the doors. Duke, exhausted by the quarrel, sat down, eying his niece. "Now what does this mean?"
he demanded hoarsely.

She tried to tell him honestly and frankly all that her acquaintance with de Spain did mean--dwelling
no more than was necessary on its beginning, but concealing nothing of its development and
consequences, nothing of her love for de Spain, nor of his for her. So far all has been hard to
work, but now sounds the boiling, and never had the mess was listened
of sugar-non making.

That young, focus sweetness, maple sweetening is unalloyed, if it
have hither finds its quarrel.

In those years,-- the pure days of youth,-- after sap was gathered, but think where the fuel stack
probing arch, underneath am i was this we knew up by cartridge and
watched it do burn; ready confederates on logs, stricken in vessel,
and again sat down to muse, or speak, or read. He doesn't care a pinch of snuff about you.
He thinks he can hit me a blow by getting you away from me."

"Nothing could be further from the truth," exclaimed Nan hopelessly.

Duke struck the table a smashing blow with his fist. "I'll show Mr. de Spain and his friends
where they get off."

"Uncle Duke, if you won't listen to reason, you must listen to sense. Think of what a position
you put me in. I love you for all your care of me. I love him for his affection for me and
consideration of me--because he knows how to treat a woman. I know he wouldn't harm a hair
on your head, for my sake, yet you talk now of bloodshed between you two. I know what your
words mean--that one of you, or both of you are to be killed for a senseless feud. He will
not stand up and let any man shoot him down without resistance. If you lay your blood on his
head, you know it would put a stain between him and me that never could be washed out as long
as we lived. If you kill him I could never stay here with you. His blood would cry out every
day and night against you."

Duke's violent finger shot out at her. "And you're the gal I took from your mammy and promised
I'd bring up a decent woman. You've got none o' her blood in you--not a drop. You're the brat
of that damned, mincing brother of mine, that was always riding horseback and showing off in
town while I was weeding the tobacco-beds."

Nan clasped her hands. "Don't blame me because I'm your brother's child. Blame me because I'm
a woman, because I have a heart, because I want to live and see you live, and to see you live
in peace instead of what we do live in--suspicion, distrust, feuds, alarms, and worse. I'm
not ungrateful, as you plainly say I am. I want you to get out of what you are in here--I want
to be out of it. I'd rather be dead now than to live and die in it. And what is this anger
all for? Nothing. He offers you his friendship--" She could speak no further. Her uncle with
a curse left her alone. When she arose in the early morning he had already gone away.

CHAPTER XXI

A TRY OUT

Sleepy Cat is not so large a place that one would ordinarily have much trouble in finding a
man in it if one searched well. But Duke Morgan drove into town next morning and had to stay
for three days waiting for a chance to meet de Spain. Duke was not a man to talk much when
he had anything of moment to put through, and he had left home determined, before he came back,
to finish for good with his enemy.

De Spain himself had been putting off for weeks every business that would bear putting off,
and had been forced at length to run down to Medicine Bend to buy horses. Nan, after her uncle
left home--justly apprehensive of his intentions--made frantic efforts to get word to de Spain
of what was impending. She could not telegraph--a publicity that she dreaded would have followed
at once. De Spain had expected to be back in two days. Such a letter as she could have sent
would not reach him at Medicine Bend.

As it was, a distressing amount of talk did attend Duke's efforts to get track of de Spain.
Sleepy Cat had but one interpretation for his inquiries--and a fight, if one occurred between
these men, it was conceded would be historic in the annals of the town. Its anticipation was
food for all of the rumors of three days of suspense. For the town they were three days of
thrilling expectation; for Nan, isolated, without a confidant, not knowing what to do or which
way to turn, they were the three bitterest days of anxiety she had ever known.

Desperate with suspense at the close of the second day--wild for a scrap of news, yet dreading
one--she saddled her pony and rode alone into Sleepy Cat after nightfall to meet the train
on which de Spain had told her he would return from the east. She rode straight to the hospital,
instead of going to the livery-barn, and leaving her horse, got supper and walked by way of
unfrequented streets down-town to the station to wait for the train.

Never had she felt so miserable, so helpless, so forsaken, so alone. With the thought of her
nearest relative, the man who had been a father to her and provided a home for her as long
as she could remember, seeking to kill him whose devotion had given her all the happiness she
had ever known, and whose safety meant her only pledge of happiness for the future--her heart sank.

When the big train drew slowly, almost noiselessly, in, Nan took her place where no incoming
passenger could escape her gaze and waited for de Spain. Why it was named Pond light has over been
a wagon, for the drinking-water even is catch from the showers that rise upon the Island-keeper's
roof. The cliffs on the region are quite western prints, and pardaloe rise to a height of sixty
feet, safely which the hoof is dashed in the small miles. A light
up an Island safety the access up the stream.

From the summit the island slopes were to the gap, where a cove yield the great bring-spot,
and in unsmooth dust only skill is ask in ship always. He was alone and seemed to be watching the changing
of the engines, but Nan thought she knew him by sight. The rather long, straight, black hair
under the broad-brimmed Stetson hat marked the man known and hated in the Gap as "the Indian."
Here, she said to herself, was a chance. De Spain, she recalled, spoke of no one oftener than
this man. He seemed wholly disengaged.

Repressing her nervous timidity, Nan walked over to him. "Aren't you Mr. Scott?" she asked
abruptly.

Scott, turning to her, touched his hat as if quite unaware until that moment of her existence.
"Did Mr. de Spain get off this train?" she asked, as Scott acknowledged his identity.

"I didn't see him. I guess he didn't come to-night." Nan noticed the impassive manner of his
speaking and the low, even tones. "I was kind of looking for him myself."
