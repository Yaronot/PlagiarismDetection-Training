[9] Viz. Atkinson and Crean, who were left at Safety Camp; E. Evans, Forde and Keohane, who
returned with the weaker ponies on Feb. 13; Meares and Wilson with the dog teams; and Scott,
Bowers, Oates, Cherry-Garrard, and Lashly.

[10] The favorite nickname for Bowers.

[11] Professor T. Edgeworth David, C.M.G., F.R.S., of Sydney University, who was the geologist
to Shackleton's party.

[12] This was done in order to measure on the next visit the results of wind and snow.

[13] Scott, Wilson, Meares and Cherry-Garrard now went back swiftly with the dog teams, to
look after the return parties at Safety Camp. Having found all satisfactory, Scott left Wilson
and Meares there with the dogs, and marched back with the rest to Corner Camp, taking more
stores to the depot and hoping to meet Bowers rearguard party.

[14] The party had made a short cut where in going out with the ponies they had made an elbow,
and so had passed within this 'danger line.'

[15] Bowers, Oates, and Gran, with the five ponies. The two days had after all brought them
to Safety Camp.

[16] This was at a point on the Barrier, one-half mile from the edge, in a S.S.E. direction
from Hut Point.

[17] I.e. by land, now that the sea ice was out.

[18] Because the seals would cease to come up.

[19] As a step towards 'getting these things clearer' in his mind two spare pages of the diary
are filled with neat tables, showing the main classes into which rocks are divided, and their
natural subdivisions--the sedimentary, according to mode of deposition, chemical, organic,
or aqueous; the metamorphic, according to the kind of rock altered by heat; the igneous, according
to their chemical composition.

[20] Viz, Simpson, Nelson, Day, Ponting, Lashly, Clissold, Hooper, Anton, and Demetri.

[21] See Chapter X.

[22] The white dogs.

[23] I.e. in relation to a sledging ration.

[24] Officially the ponies were named after the several schools which had subscribed for their
purchase: but sailors are inveterate nicknamers, and the unofficial humour prevailed. See Appendix,
Note 18.

[25] Captain Scott's judgment was not at fault.

[26] I.e. a crack which leaves the ice free to move with the movements of the sea beneath.

[27] This was the gale that tore away the roofing of their hut, and left them with only their
sleeping-bags for shelter. See p. 365.

[28] Prof. T. Edgeworth David, of Sydney University, who accompanied Shackleton's expedition
as geologist.

[29] See Vol. II., Dr. Simpson's Meteorological Report.

[30] This form of motor traction had been tested on several occasions; in 1908 at Lauteret
in the Alps, with Dr. Charcot the Polar explorer: in 1909 and again 1910 in Norway. After each
trial the sledges were brought back and improved.

[31] The Southern Barrier Depôt.

[32] Camp 31 received the name of Shambles Camp.

[33] While Day and Hooper, of the ex-motor party, had turned back on November 24, and Meares
and Demetri with the dogs ascended above the Lower Glacier Depot before returning on December
11, the Southern Party and its supports were organised successively as follows:

    December 10, leaving Shambles Camp--
        Sledge 1. Scott, Wilson, Oates and P.O. Evans.
        Sledge 2. E. Evans, Atkinson, Wright, Lashly.
        Sledge 3. Bowers, Cherry-Garrard, Crean, Keohane.
    January 4, 150 miles from the Pole--
        Sledge 1. Scott, Wilson, Oates, Bowers, P.O. Evans;
                    while E. Evans, Crean, and Lashly returned.

[34] The Lower Glacier Depot.

[35] In the pocket journal, only one side of each page had been written on. Coming to the end
of it, Scott reversed the book, and continued his entries on the empty backs of the pages.

[36] A unit of food means a week's supplies for four men.

[37] A number preceded by R. marks the camps on the return journey.
