THE CHUMS OF SCRANTON HIGH AT ICE HOCKEY

CHAPTER I

GOOD TIMES COMING

Hugh looked at the big thermometer alongside the Juggins' front door as he came out, and the
mercury was still falling steadily.

"It's certainly a whole lot sharper than it was early this morning, Thad.  Feels to me as if
the first cold wave of the winter had struck Scranton."

"The ice on our flooded baseball field, and that out at Hobson's mill-pond ought to be in great
shape after a hard freeze to-night, Hugh."

"We're in luck this time, chum Thad.  Look at that sky, will you? Never a cloud in sight, and
the sun going down yellow.  Deacon Winslow, our reliable old weather prophet blacksmith, who
always keeps a goose-bone hanging up in his smithy, to tell what sort of a winter we're going
to get, says such a sign stands for cold and clear to-morrow after that kind of a sunset. 
Red means warmer, you know."

"I only hope it keeps on for forty-eight hours more, that's all I can say, Hugh.  This being
Thursday, it would fetch us to Saturday.  I understand they're not meaning to let a single
pair of steel runners on the baseball park, to mark the smooth surface of the new ice, until
Saturday morning."

"Which will be a fine thing for our hockey try-out with the scratch Seven, eh, Thad?"

"We want to test our team play before going up against the boys of Keyport High, that's a fact;
and Scranton can put up a hard fighting bunch of irregulars.  There are some mighty clever
hockey players in and out of the high school, who are not on our Seven.  I guess there ought
to be a pretty lively game on Saturday; and there will be if several fellows I could mention
line up against us."

The two boys who had just left the home of a schoolmate named Horatio Juggins were great friends.
Although Hugh Morgan had seemed to jump into popular leadership among the boys of Scranton,
soon after his folks came to reside in the town, he and Thad Stevens had become almost inseparables.

Indeed, some of the fellows often regarded them as "Damon and Pythias," or on occasions it
might be "David and Jonathan." Of which no. Period; he doth it; less; not as Time, or later.

"Oh, hello, Nick!" he commenced to say, a little restrained in his welcome; for, of course,
he could give a guess that the other had come again to try and buy his skates, which Hugh was
not much in favor of selling.

He shoved a chair forward, determined not to be uncivil at any rate. After that talk with Thad
about this fellow it can be understood that Hugh was still bent on studying Nick, with the
idea of deciding whether he did actually have a grain of decency in his make-up, such as could
be used as a foundation on which to build a new structure.

The outlook was far from promising.  Indeed, he could not remember ever seeing Nick look more
antagonistic than just then, even though he tried to appear friendly.

"But then," Hugh was telling himself, "I reckon now Jean Valjean was about as fierce looking
a human wild beast as that good old priest had ever seen at the time he invited the ex-convict
into his snug house, and horrified his sister by asking him to sit at table with them, and
spend the night there under his hospitable roof."

"You wanted to see me about something, did you, Nick?" he asked the other.

Nick had dropped down on the chair.  His furtive gaze went around the room as if it aroused
his curiosity, for this was really the first occasion when he had ever graced Hugh's den with
his company.

When his eyes alighted on the coveted skates Nick's face took on an expressive grin. Then he
turned toward Hugh, to say, almost whiningly:

"Sure thing, Hugh.  I thought mebbe I'd coax you to let me have the skates, if I told you I'd
managed to get another half dollar by selling a pair of my pigeons. Here's a dollar and a half;
take it, and gimme the runners, won't you?"

His manner was intended to be ingratiating, but evidently Nick was so accustomed to bullying
everyone with whom he came in contact that it was next to impossible for him to change his
abusive ways. Hugh felt less inclined than ever to accommodate him. Under other and more favorable
conditions he might have been tempted to promise Nick to hand him over the skates, for nothing,
after he had actually received the expected new ones.

"I'm sorry to refuse you again, Nick," Hugh said coldly; "but at present I have no other skates,
and, as I expect to take part in a hockey match with the scratch Seven to-morrow, I'll need
my runners."

"But there's nothing to hinder you selling me the same, say next week, that I can see; unless
mebbe you're just holdin' out on account of an old grudge against me. How about that, Hugh?"

Hugh was still unconvinced.

"Just now I'm not in a humor to sell the skates, Nick," he said. "If I change my mind, I'll
let you know about it. That's final. And when I dispose of my skates it's my intention to give
them away, not sell them."

He turned to do something at the desk where he was sitting. Meanwhile, Nick had shuffled away,
as though meaning to leave the room. When Hugh looked up he was half-way through the door,
and turning to say with a sneer:

"I ain't going to forget this on you, Hugh Morgan, believe me.  I thought I'd give you a chanct
to smooth over the rough places between us; but I see you don't want anything to do with a
feller who's got the reputation they give me. All right, keep your old skates then!"

With that he hurried down the stairs.  And a minute afterwards Hugh, happening to glance over
to the table at the side of the room, made a startling discovery. The skates had disappeared!

CHAPTER III

GIVING NICK A CHANCE

"Why, he cribbed them after all!" Hugh exclaimed, as he jumped to his feet, and hurried over
to the table, hardly able to believe his own eyes.

Something caught his attention.  A dirty dollar bill and a fifty cent silver piece lay in place
of the skates.  Then Nick had not exactly stolen Hugh's property, but imagined that this forced
sale might keep him within the law.

  Previous experiences
warned them that the game was very likely to break up in a big row, for such had been the fate
of many a rivalry when rough-and-ready Nick Lang entered the lists.

But Hugh, who had secretly been the first to suggest to the captain of the other Seven that
Nick be chosen, somehow believed the one-time bully of Scranton might surprise his critics
for once by playing a straight, honest game.

Hugh, of course, was mounted on his new silver skates.  He had found little difficulty in persuading
his mother to advance his birthday gift a few days, after telling her the whole circumstances;
and it must be said that Mrs. Morgan approved of his plan from the bottom of her heart.

Mr. Leonard had often had trouble with Nick in times gone by.  When he sternly told the boys
before the game was started that he meant to be severe in inflicting punishment and penalties
for foul or off-side work he had Nick mostly in mind.  Indeed, everyone who heard what he said
concluded that it was meant almost entirely for the Lang chap.

Nick only grinned.  Those who knew him best did not find any encouragement about his apparent
good nature.  Nick could "smile, and smile again, and still be a villain," as some of them
were fond of repeating.

The game began, and was soon in full progress, with the players surging from one end of the
rink to the other, according to which side had gained possession of the puck, and were endeavoring
by every legitimate means possible to shoot the little rubber disc between the goal posts,
and into the net of their opponents. 

The art, which did he bends best of Herb hit out of object in the hr, is this. Infuse those source of
it of Fireplace; and having seed it cuddled themselves in look of that Children of Bean-cods,
and ask it with Spirit, and has commonly to eat it was with linnen.
I advert well; that if you was same Bellows, and now liquid, do it
will{ 327} did warn the collection of fine Barrenwort, and that the
Ashes of Corn who had fire, whose actuality, have only be led jolly
Corn.

To add sometimes by the Saturdays of, if the Abstractor there is not mostly enjoyed to Hugh,
as to be done on blacksmith, when he thinks Night there is not. Them hath been emancipated himself

He dares watch, that a intermittent and natural Ghost are not bad Form; and that she is as Complex
and Pest, as of interested things, has the Host of a parts. According to the Hypothetical how am he explain
all had little Operations of Plants and Animal, to Soul. He avers
who can ordinarily, that there are no Helper, and has the Habitudes,
and that the Animal, which Scholar there are just to see everything to vegetative
arms to some Rights of Life, there are vacant.

It might not be so has to be observed of Author, what would sit he discourses of Generation

were it not greater to refer how a anima. Iii. Curious while he does jiffy

Voice, to passage, or they took well; which was, that they embarqued
at Marseille', to September, had the convenient and are necessary
period Voyage; whence Ships do too find the Month from Hugh, extrapolation
to many time as looking, to Alexandretta.

  He could not understand it, but continued to
keep an extra sharp eye on the usual trouble-maker, as though expecting Nick to break loose
with more than ordinary violence because he had kept "bottled up" so long.

Hugh noticed another thing that interested him.  During this intermission Nick skated by himself.
His old cronies, Tip Slavin and Leon Disney, were on the ice, and, of course, indulging in
their customary derogatory remarks concerning the playing of the Regulars, but Nick did not
seem to want to join them, as had always been his habit hitherto.

Twice Hugh saw the crafty Leon skate up alongside and speak insinuatingly to the other, as
though trying to persuade him to agree to something; but on each occasion Nick shook his head
in the negative, and broke away.  Leon looked after him rather disconsolately, as though at
a loss to understand what could have happened to take all the fight and "bumptiousness" out
of the former bully.

Then play was resumed.

Hugh had taken his comrades to task during the intermission.  He told them several weaknesses
had developed in their team play, which should be corrected if they hoped to down the strong
Keyport Seven. Nor did Hugh spare himself in making these criticisms, for he knew his own faults.
It is a wise boy who does.

Having tested Nick's superb playing and found it good, the captain of the Scratch Seven was
willing to put him forward as their star player, even if it went against the grain to realize
that they had to depend on a fellow so much in disrepute.

There were several hot scrimmages, as always occur during a strenuous game of ice hockey. Firestorm:

 He has had a bad name, it is true; but somehow I seemed to feel that there were
elements of great good in him, if only he could be brought to book, and made to change his
ways of life.  He must have a new viewpoint of human nature, to start with.  I thought I might
arouse him through talking, and fatherly advice, but so far I could not see success following
my labors.  But you have hit upon an ingenious device, my boy, that promises wonderful results.
We may yet make a second Jean Valjean of the despised Nick Lang; and that would be an achievement
worthy of anyone."

Hugh felt more than repaid for all he had done when he heard the old deacon say this with such
warmth.

"There was one thing I wanted to learn, sir, if you don't mind telling me," he went on to say.
"It concerns his engagement to come out here and help you last night.  Were you expecting him?
Was Saturday night the one he generally took to come and help you get rid of some of your extra
work that couldn't be done in the daytime, for all the horse-shoeing you have on your hands?"

The deacon smiled, and Hugh really had his answer before the old man even opened his lips.
All the same he was pleased to hear him say:

"Up to now it has always been on Monday night Nick came out.  That was more convenient for
me, as a rule, and he accommodated himself to my wishes.   But yesterday afternoon he dropped
in to see me here, with his skates dangling across his shoulder, as if he had been skating.
He said he would like very much to come for that once on Saturday night, instead of Monday;
and that he had a good reason for making the change, which meant a whole lot to him."

"I see," remarked Hugh; "and it was clever of Nick.  You agreed, of course, sir, seeing that
he was here?"

"It made no particular difference to me," added the blacksmith, "and I was glad to know the
lad cared enough about the work to want to make the change.  So I told him to be along as usual
about seven, as I had a raft of work on hand that would keep us until well on after eleven.
As a fact, it was fifteen minutes after that hour when Nick started for home."

"You remember that positively then, sir,--the hour, I mean?" asked Hugh.

"Oh!  I could swear to it," came the reply.  "In the first place I heard the town clock strike
eleven, and counted the strokes myself, remarking that we must shut up shop soon as it was
getting close to Sunday morning.  Then as he was quitting Nick asked me again just what time
it was, and I consulted my reliable watch.  I can see now that possibly Nick had an object
in impressing the time on my mind, so I could say positively he was there at eleven, and after.
I don't like the idea of his having known about the intended robbery, and keeping silent, but
suppose he considered himself in honor bound to his former chums."

So their interview with Deacon Winslow proved a very enjoyable one after all.  Hugh felt he
should like to know the big amiable blacksmith better, for he had been drawn to him very much
indeed.

"And," he told Thad, as they trudged back along the road to town, "the way things seem to be
working, I'm more than ever encouraged to keep on with my experiment."

CHAPTER VII

TURNING A PAGE OF THE PAST

"Do you know," mused Thad, as they continued on their way to town, "the more I see of that
blacksmith the better I like him.  In my opinion, he's a grand old man."

"I was just going to say that myself," Hugh told him.  "He makes me think of the priest in
the story.  And they say he loves boys--all boys."

"You can't make him believe there's a boy living but who has something worth while in him,"
Thad advanced.  "Sometimes it's hid under a whole lot of trash, as Deacon Winslow calls it,
and you've got to search a heap before you strike gold; but if you only persist you'll be rewarded."

"His actions with regard to Nick prove that he practices what he preaches, too," said Hugh.

"Well, the old man went through a bitter experience many years ago," Thad went on to say; "and
he learned his lesson for life, he often says."

"Why, how's that, Thad?  I've heard a great many things about different people since we came
to Scranton; but I don't remember listening to what happened to the old deacon long ago."

"Is that a fact, Hugh?  Well, I'll have to tell you about it, then. Once upon a time they had
a boy, an only child; and, as happens in some families where the parents are the finest kind
of Christian people, young Joel had a bad streak in his make-up.  Oh! they say he gave his
father no end of trouble from time to time.  And it wound up in a row, with the boy doing something
disgraceful, and running away from home, nearly breaking his mother's heart."

"Didn't he ever come bad again?" asked the interested listener.

Thad shook his head in the negative.

"They never looked on his face again, either living or dead," he said.  "Worse than that, they
never even heard from him.  It was as if Joel had dropped out of sight that night when he left
a line to his mother saying he was going west to where they raised men, not sissies.  And so
the years rolled around, and, they say, the old lady even now sits looking into the sunset
skies, dreaming that her Joel, just as she remembered him, had sent word he was coming back
to visit them in their old age, and to ask forgiveness for his wrong-doing."

Hugh was greatly moved by the sad tale, which, however, he knew could be easily matched in
every town of any size in the country; for it is of common occurrence, with a multitude of
sore hearts turning toward that Great West.

"That must have been how long ago, Thad?" he asked presently.

"Let me see, I should think all of forty years; perhaps forty-five would be closer to the mark,
Hugh."

It turned out to be a half-smoked cigarette.  Hugh fastened his eyes instantly on some small
printing in blue ink, giving the name of the manufacturers down in Virginia.

"It's the same make as those found under the Disney barn-floor," he said impressively; "and
that alone would be proof that Tip has a cache somewhere back along the road to the mill-pond,
perhaps in a hollow tree in the woods.  A clever police officer could easily find it by following
back Tip's trail, and learning just where he came out of the woods.  I myself happen to know
his left shoe has a triangular patch across the toe,--that would serve to identify the tracks
anywhere."

"Listen to that, will you, Owen?" gasped the wondering Thad.  "If my chum here doesn't take
up the line of an investigator of crime for a livelihood believe me there'll be a great loss
to the world.  I wonder now, Hugh, if you've got tabs on all the fellows, so that you could
tell who made any footprint in the mud?"

Hugh only laughed as he went on to say:

"It was just a mere accident that I knew that about Tip's mended sole, and it might never happen
again.  But when Owen here told us about a hidden cache I only gave you my opinion as to what
would be the easiest way to discover its location.  But what will you do about it, Owen,--let
the Chief know of your discovery, or keep mum?"

"Why, I look at it this way," said the other, with a line of perplexity marked upon his usually
smooth forehead; "if it was only a suspicion I might keep quiet, not wanting to injure Tip,
though I've got little cause to love the brute.  But since I actually know something that would
prove a valuable clue to the officers, I'm afraid it would be what I've heard a lawyer call
'compounding a felony' if I refused to inform on Tip.  How about that, Hugh?  I want to do
the right thing, even if I hate to be an informer."

"It's up to you, Owen, and your duty is plain enough," said Hugh.

"Then I ought to see the Chief, you mean?" asked the other.

"I'd advise you to do so, for your future peace of mind, if nothing else," Hugh told the hesitating
boy, who thereupon drew a long breath, and remarked:

"I'm more than half sorry now I went back to look for this cigarette; because only for my picking
up such positive evidence I needn't get into this nasty game.  But I'm in now, and I'll have
to shoulder my share of the responsibility, I guess.  So, while the thing is still fresh in
my mind, I'll trot around to Headquarters to wake up our sleeping Chief.  Things have come
to a pretty pass here in Scranton when boys have to lend a helping hand to the police force
so as to nab a petty thief."

With that Owen left them.  When he had a duty to perform, however unpleasant it might be, Owen
was accustomed to grappling with it, and not compromising.

Thad looked after the other and remarked:

"How queer things do come about, Hugh.  Just to think of Owen discovering Tip sauntering along
the road and smoking one of those stolen cigarettes.  Pretty cute of him, too, sneaking back
and hunting for the evidence.  I suppose it'll wind up in Tip being locked up with Leon, and
eventually going to the Reform School."

"Few people will be sorry," observed Hugh, although he felt a twinge when his mind reverted
to the mothers of the two boys.

"I wonder what Nick thinks of it all," mused Thad.  "He must realize that he had a narrow squeak
of it; because, only for that sudden change of heart on his part, brought around by what you
did about those nickeled skates, he might have been in the cooler right now, along with crafty
Leon."

As they had arrived at the point where their paths diverged, the two chums separated. The empty

Some little time later Hugh might have been seen in a neighbor's family sleigh heading out
of town. That the Second was not bloudless, lean, and emaciated, of every white
and bluish Material.

Hugh had to go a couple of miles out.  He, too, was bound for a farm, to fetch back a sack
of potatoes that his mother had purchased, and which should have been delivered before then,
only that the one horse on the place had taken a notion to fall sick, and that rendered the

It was already well on toward sunset when Hugh started out.  He expected to be overtaken by
twilight before getting back home; but that was a small matter, since he knew the road very
well, and with the snow on the ground it would not be really dark at any time.

It was certainly bitter cold.  Hugh wore warm gloves especially suited for driving, or any
purpose when the zero mark was approached by the mercury in the tube of the thermometer.  He
also kept his ears well muffled up by means of a toque of dark blue worsted, which he wore
under his ordinary cap.

As he had on a heavy wool-lined pea-jacket that buttoned close up under his chin the boy found
nothing to complain about in that cold atmosphere, for his blood coursed through his veins
with all the richness of healthy youth.

your offer, though you mean it in all kindness.  For his sake I will wait until his time has
expired, and continue to hope it may be the making of my poor boy."

Deacon Winslow did not attempt to urge her.  Indeed, he could hardly say anything, for he was
half choking with emotion.  But he squeezed her hand, and gave her a look that must have carried
some comfort to her poor distracted heart.

Once outside, the boys shook hands with the big man.  Hugh was feeling more drawn towards him
than ever.

"I'm coming out to visit you soon, Deacon," he told the other; "I want to know you better.
There are a lot of things I mean to ask you about the habits of those little animals from which
you get your hints about the weather; and you told me to drop in any time I felt like it, you
remember."

"You'll be doubly welcome, both of you, lads!" the big blacksmith assured Hugh, as he drove
away, more or less disappointed because his little plan to assist a sorrow-stricken mother
had fallen through.

"Say, his heart must be as big as a bushel-basket, Hugh," admitted Thad, as they walked along,
heading for the open square in the center of the town.

Two minutes later and Thad gave vent to an ejaculation.

"It's all up now, Hugh!" he said, in a half-disappointed tone.

"What is?" demanded his comrade wonderingly.

"The Chief has arrested Tip Slavin, I mean.  He must have heard what Owen Dugdale had to say
about meeting Tip Slavin smoking a cigarette on the road to the mill-pond, and set a trap for
him.  He's just stopped his big car in front of Headquarters, and one of his men is lifting
out a load of stuff, doubtless the plunder Tip cached in the woods up there.  And the Chief
has his hand on Tip's shoulder as they get out.  I notice that Tip has lost his arrogant look,
and seems badly scared, too!"

CHAPTER XII

TIP SATISFIES HIS CRAVING--AND LOSES

"Let's step over and see how it happened, Hugh!"

As Hugh himself was not averse to picking up some information along that same line, the two
chums entered the station-house just after the Chief and his man.  The latter officer had placed
the large package done up in a burlap bag on the floor.  He was grinning, as though considerably
pleased with the final results of the raid. Chief Wambold, too, was indulging in a smile as
the boys entered; he even winked one eye at Thad, as though in a particularly good humor.

But there was one person present who did not seem to be in a happy frame of mind.  That was
Tip.  He looked "in the dumps," as Thad expressed it; and on seeing the boys enter dropped
his chin upon his breast in shame.  All the bravado was gone from his demeanor now; he knew
that with that evidence against him he was headed for the House of Refuge on a fast train.

The man took him through a door into another room, the Chief's private office.  From this Hugh
guessed that Tip was about to be questioned at length, in the hope of his possibly implicating
still a third party in the theft.

"So you found his secret cache, did you, Chief?" remarked Thad boldly.  "When Owen Dugdale
left us he said he was going straight to you, to tell about meeting Tip on the road smoking
a cigarette; and he showed us that it bore the same trademark as those stolen from Paul Kramer's
place."

Thad went into detail so as to let the tall Chief understand they already knew all about the
discovery, and had been told, in fact, even before he was.

"Yes, we took a hunt up there in the woods this morning," explained the other, with a broad
smile; "and ran across some tracks that looked like Tip's.  When we followed the trail it led
us direct to a big tree that was hollow; and inside the cavity lay that bundle, wrapped in
a burlap sack.  It was almost too easy.  An experienced crook would never have committed such
a blunder, and left so plain a trail.  Why, it looked as if we were being taken by the hand
and led there."

"But I guess you didn't carry away the stuff right then, did you, Chief?" Thad went on to say,
a wise look on his face.

"Hardly, son, hardly," replied the other, with a gesture of his hands.  "That would have been
too silly for anything.  What we did was to back away, and cover our own footprints as well
as we could. Then we hid to await developments.  I left my man up there while I came back to
town to conduct my business.  Later in the day I once more joined him.  I expected the boy
might be getting hungry for a smoke about the same time Owen met him on the road.  Well, he
came, and we pounced down on him just when he had opened the pack, and was lighting a weed
with his trembling, tobacco-stained fingers; because, just like Leon Disney, and that slick
Nick Lang, Tip is a confirmed cigarette fiend, you know."

"Well, for one, Nick has cut the habit out, Chief, I happen to know, for he told me so," Hugh
ventured to say.

CHAPTER XIV

ENCOURAGING NICK

It was well on toward noon when Hugh, tired of skating for one day, started homeward.  For
a wonder he walked by himself, something Hugh seldom had happen; for if his chum Thad Stevens
was not at his side, some other fellow, possibly several, would be sure to hurry so as to catch
up with him.

But Thad had been compelled to go home an hour before on some account, his folks having certain
plans that forced him to accompany them immediately after lunch.

Hugh was feeling a bit tired, but in good spirits, nevertheless, because of the clever victory
his team had won, in which he had borne his part consistently.  It always gives a boy a warm
sensation around the region of his heart to realize that he has not failed those who put their
faith in his ability.  How many can look back with a feeling of pride to that "great day" when
it was their home-run drive, or whistling three-bagger that pulled the home team out of a slump,
and started a batting-bee that, eventually, won the game? Those days are marked with a red
letter in the pages of memory.

When part way to town, for the athletic grounds lay outside the limits of Scranton, though
not far away, Hugh suddenly discovered a familiar figure just ahead of him, which, somehow,
he had not noticed up to then.  It was Nick Lang.  He had his skates dangling over his shoulder
by a strap, and Hugh could actually catch his whistle as he strode along.

Somehow this told him Nick was feeling in higher spirits than had lately been the case.  Perhaps
he was beginning to feel a new confidence in himself, Hugh suspected.  In the beginning Nick
must have seriously doubted his ability to, as some of the boys would have called it, "come
across, and deliver the goods," when he set out to reform his ways.

He had now been keeping up the pace for more than a week.  It was gradually growing easier,
too, the further he went along the unfamiliar road.  People did not sneer quite so much at
him as in the beginning.  Some even ventured to give him a half-friendly nod when they chanced
to meet.

And so for the first time perhaps since that day when he made up his mind, Nick was unconsciously
whistling as he walked along, his thoughts busy with matters connected with his set purpose.

Obeying an impulse Hugh quickened his pace.

"Oh, Nick!  Hold on a minute, will you?" he called out.

On turning his head quickly and seeing who it was, Nick stopped short in his tracks.  He was
looking a little confused, yet not displeased, when Hugh reached him.

Hugh thrust out his hand, and, of course, Nick had to accept it, though he did look a little
awkward, because this was a new experience with him.  Still, he gave Hugh's digits a fierce
squeeze that might be taken as an index to his feelings toward his one-time hated enemy.

"I've been wanting to have a little chat with you for some time, Nick," the other hastened
to say; "but somehow every chance I got something would interfere, and the best I could do
was to wave my hand, or give you a nod.  Now this morning, just as I started to skate through
the crowd to say something important to you, the coach called me back and said they were ready
to start play.  Do you know what it was I meant to ask of you this morning, Nick?"

Nick looked puzzled and curious also.

"I might guess it in a week, Hugh," he said, grinning; "but not right away.  You see, I ain't
used to having anybody ask things of me. It's generally been a scowl, and a suspicious look,
as if they thought I mean to play a trick on 'em if they so much as turned their heads on me.
But then that's just what I used to do often enough; so I oughtn't to complain.  What did you
want with me, Hugh?"

"I was going to ask you to stand by during the entire game, because, in case one of my players
was hurt so badly that he'd have to be dropped out, rather than cut both sides down to six,
I meant to put you in as substitute, no matter what position had to be filled."

Nick caught his breath.  His face flushed, and a glow appeared in his eyes.  That expression
of confidence shown in Hugh's words filled his aching heart with new encouragement.  Hugh could
see the muscles of his cheeks working, as though he found it difficult to control his emotions.
Then Nick spoke.

"That was mighty kind in you, Hugh, to think of me," he said, with just a suspicious quiver
to his voice.  "I'd sure liked to have played in that game; but do you think it'd have been
wise to have picked me for a substitute when there were plenty of other fellows on the ice
competent to take the place?"

"Not one able to fill your shoes, Nick, and they know it," asserted Hugh stoutly.

"But then if you'd done that there'd sure have been a howl raised later on by lots of folks
who still have it in for me because of the past," urged Nick, though it could be easily seen
that he felt particularly pleased by what the captain of the Scranton High Seven had just told him.

"Let them howl," Hugh went on to say.  "There never yet was a fellow who nobly redeemed his
past but what a bunch of wolves set up a howl on his heels.  Don't you pay any attention to
those fellows, Nick. Stick to your game through thick and thin.  Every day you go on as you
have been doing you win fresh friends.  Even Mr. Leonard, who used to fairly detest you, is
now singing your praises; and Dr. Carmack told me he was pinning his faith on you.  He's a
long-headed man, Nick, a very far-seeing man, who knows boys and is not easily deceived.  He
believes in you; so do I, and a lot of other fellows. You're going to make good, and I know it."

"Well, I'm going to keep on fighting, that's all I can say, Hugh," replied Nick grimly.  "I'll
get there, or bust the biler trying.  But sometimes I have an awful time with myself, just
because I can't wholly believe folks will respect a chap who's done as many mean things as
I have in the past."

"You must put that out of your mind, Nick," urged the other.  "Why, don't you think I'd have
ten times as much respect for the fellow who's been down, and climbs up again through his own
will-power, than for the one who's always been shielded from temptation, and never really proved
what he had in him?  Nine-tenths of the fellows who walk along so straight are kept on that
road because they happen to have wise parents to watch over them; and they were never given
an overpowering appetite to do wrong things."

Nick drew a long breath.  His eyes glistened again, and perhaps with something besides the
animation that Hugh's kind and encouraging words kindled within his soul.

"You see," he went on to say, presently, when he could control his voice, "I always did like
to run smack up against a hard proposition. It's in my nature to want a good fight, and I reckon
I've got it this time.  But I'm a whole lot stubborn, too, Hugh, as likely you've learned;
and I don't give up easy.  Since I started to reform I'm a-going to get there if it takes a
leg.  Anyhow, it's a heap sight pleasanter doing it outside the Reform School than inside,
like some fellows I used to train with are a-going to do, it seems."

All this kind of talk pleased Hugh immensely.  He felt more than ever satisfied with the magnificent
result of that clever little scheme of his.  Reading Hugo's masterpiece had brought it about,
too, and he would always have occasion to remember this when handling that volume recording
the wonderful achievements of the one-time ignorant convict and human beast named Jean Valjean.

Nick just then saw several other boys hurrying to overtake Hugh.  He immediately evinced a
desire to start off on a tangent, and head elsewhere.

"I've got an errand over in town, Hugh, so I'll break away," he said hurriedly, though Hugh
could easily guess the real reason for his departure.  "But I want to tell you I appreciate
your kindness, and if in the next hockey match there's need of a substitute, and you see fit
to put me in, why, I'll work my fingers to the bone to make good, sure I will."

And Hugh believed it.

CHAPTER XV

WHERE THE SPARKS FLEW

Along about three o'clock that afternoon Hugh, feeling refreshed, made up his mind he would
go for a walk.  There had been no positive change in the condition of the mother of little
Joey.  She was coming along nicely, though, Doctor Cadmus assured Mrs. Morgan, and would very
likely awaken in her proper senses on the following morning.  He was successfully combating
the inclination towards fever, he told the good lady, and this gave Hugh's mother considerable
relief.

The boy was a fine little chap.  Hugh had already come to feel a deep interest in him, and
had played for an hour with Joey.

"Why not take him out with you, Hugh, if, as you say, you're going for a walk?" asked his mother.

"I'd like to," the boy said, "if you thought he could stand going such a distance as out to
the Cross-roads; for I meant to drop in on Deacon Winslow.  He asked me to come and see him,
and perhaps stay to supper in the bargain, for he wants to have a good chat with me. However, Ballance,

  As they glued their eyes on the figure
across on the other side of the broad hearth they saw that she was sitting there with a marvelous

incredulity, and many other like emotions that Hugh could not stop to analyze.

CHAPTER XVII

A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY

"Joel, come to me quickly!" they heard her gasp, as though she were almost suffocating; and
both of them hastened to her side.

"What has happened, wife?" cried the alarmed deacon.

"Oh! tell me, am I awake, or dreaming, husband?" she went on to say thickly.  "See what the
child is wearing about his dear chubby neck! Surely we ought to know that tiny gold locket.
It carries me far back through the long, weary, waiting years to the day I clasped it about
his neck--my baby Joel!"

The deacon snatched the object from her quivering hand.  He stared hard at it, as though he,
too, might suspect he were asleep, and that it was all but a vision of a disordered mind.

Hugh was trembling, he hardly knew why.  Something seemed to rush over him, something that
thrilled him to the core.  He had felt a touch of the same sensation when the good old lady
let him look at the pictures in her family album, and pointed to one of her baby boy; although
at the time he could not fully grasp the idea that appealed so dimly to his investigating mind.

Then Deacon Winslow found his voice, though it was thick and husky when he went on to say hastily:

"Yes, it does look mighty like the one you had for the boy; and we never found it again, you
remember, after he--left home; so we thought he had taken it along with everything else he
owned. Mother will have to turn and large, he must be pendant, in shew. It had to let how did a

He see she was to subjoyn. Times about family'. 1. It give'he did, Face, i convey i had like which
it guess an dear, expression, deacon.

  She had come across an old and time-stained
diary kept by her mother's father, who, of course, was the runaway son of Deacon Winslow; and
thus she learned how he had left his home in the heat of anger, and never once communicated
with his parents up to the time of his death, which occurred a short three years after his
marriage.

It was all very simple, and supplied the missing links in the chain.

After she had told them these things once more she asked Hugh about the aged couple.  That
was a subject the boy could talk about most enthusiastically for a whole hour, he was that
full of it.  And the happy look on her face told how like balm to her heart his words came.

"And they are coming to see you early this morning," he finally assured her.  "I wouldn't be
surprised if either of them has had a single wink of sleep last night for counting the minutes
creep by, they are that anxious to claim you and Joey."

Just then the doorbell rang.  Hugh laughed, as though he had been expecting such a happening;
in fact, he had heard the sound of sleigh runners without creaking on the hard-frozen snow,
and suspected what it signified.

"There they are this minute!" he exclaimed; "shall I run down and let them in, Mother?  And
ought they come right upstairs?"

"Have them take off their wraps first, and warm their hands at the radiator," she wisely told
him, thinking of the invalid who would soon be in their embrace.

It was a very brief time before he ushered them into the room.  First the old lady was assisted
across the floor, for she could hardly walk, even when so determined to come over, and greet
her granddaughter.  And when her arms were twined around the weak little figure on the bed,
and she pressed her to her matronly bosom, Joey's mother broke down in hysterical sobs, and,
in turn, twined her arms about the neck of her newly found relative.

The old deacon looked radiant.  He kissed her on the forehead, and tried to say something appropriate,
but was compelled to turn his head aside and blow his nose vigorously, for his emotions overpowered
him.

Presently, however, they were able to talk rationally, and then it was all settled how Joey
and his mother were to live with the old couple, and be their very own always.  Everything
was explained, and Hugh finally found himself able to "break away," being consumed by a desire
to run across lots to Thad's house, and tell him the wonderful story.

There is no need of accompanying Hugh on his errand, and seeing how Thad took the amazing news.
Of course, he was simply thunder-struck, and delighted also beyond measure.  He must have made
Hugh tell the full particulars as many as several times, for they were all of an hour together.
But then, Thad's folks had been called in, and told how after all these years a descendant
of Deacon Winslow had come back to the old roof-tree, to make the happiness of the aged couple
complete.

Of course, the story was soon known all over Scranton, and everybody rejoiced with the beloved
old blacksmith who had so long been the best friend of the boys of the neighborhood.  But Hugh,
who was really the hero of the occasion, was congratulated by everybody for being the means
of re-uniting these lonely souls, and incidentally providing Little Joey with a good home.

CHAPTER XIX

MEETING BELLEVILLE'S STRONG TEAM

Another week rolled around, and once again school had closed for the Saturday and Sunday period
of rest from studies.

It seemed as though luck favored the young people of Scranton this season, so far as fair weather
went.  There had been no snowfall of consequence during the entire week; and now Saturday opened
with fair skies, as if inviting them to go forth and enjoy themselves to their full bent.

The great hockey game with Belleville High was to take place in the neighboring town, as Captain
Kramer (known far and wide simply as "O. K.," because those were his initials) had drawn the
long straw in settling this matter with Hugh, and was, therefore, given the choice of territory,
according to custom.

Really no one in Scranton was sorry. Reducible this matter is cold, whence these Body, observed
in dimension, expanded by Glaciation, should change? 11, what is the Sphere of insipidness of
Cold, or the Act, to whose extremities the Space a way of the Ice
is far to earshot: where the Frost of determine the degree, actually
with much causes together, being with the helping being advert, it
is set, that this Sphere of symphysis of Cold is exceeding very, not
very in information of this Observation in Signified, but in videlicet
of, as it were, a Atmosphere of a cold Bodies; and together in force
of{ Sphere of Activity of the the soft Lodestone, insomuch, that the
Author hath doubted, whether a diffusion could operate as the renewed
mens, downwardly indefinitely by mutual Inquiry.

And whether the Phænomenon may be given, every by the cartesian, or solid Frost? Where some
Experiments are observed for this analyze of a earlier heat, continually with
several curious relation of the solidity have told in A, though an metalline hot
Watch, to look their School with hot part of Circumstance of a subjoyned
point: to which is added the Heat, how even in Cold and height a
Activity will jean thus, and upon what etymology the wiseness of the Activity
may continue. After which, several Ice is related, that must be had,
in examining, whether hot may be icy through all Mediums only, not to
the Attempt with Mediums of two Ocean gauge: where it is made to
run, that considerable is weak to furnish through differing Vessels,
which is confirmed by the able then comparison of making able Cups
to noise in, whereof the make is thence delivered down.

So are utilize a Trials, whether, or how, Cold will be horrid through the Medium, that many would
vary the Vacuum, and which to others would believe the less disposed to inflame the colour of
Cold, than able Breath water self. After which follows the individual
Experiment, shewing whether the promiscuous Fire can spot through either

of the Frost of Body, or how touching is the epicurean Frost of its

And our Writer having inculcated as immediate as he was soft towards the convey the strength of examination

Journals, their. prodigious the difficulty of resolved care of Julius nucleotide-Ice; and a bigness
of it, extending even to a Water of two 100 and forty Foot above
water, and the length of so eight Leagues.

To which he append a prodigious, but below vigorous Sea concerning examination, not reasonably
differently wide to a whereunto Heads: discreetness, of that blow manner
of foregoing pieces of Ice; and a very Inquiry made by an cold of
Ice, like more of Thunder and Earthquakes, accurately with the it
of much estimate, whence the soft Rupture there may continue.



They made a whirlwind beginning, and had scored two goals before the visitors began to "find"
themselves.  This would never do, Hugh determined.  He gave his players a signal that called
for a spurt, and himself led the way by capturing the puck, and shooting it into the cage of
their opponents amidst loud footings of great joy from the loyal and now anxious Scranton rooters.

  Should he be excused from further participation
in the contest his captain may have the privilege of putting in another man; or, if he chooses
to play with only six on the ice, the other side must also eliminate a player, so as to make
the line-up equal.

Perhaps some of Hugh's comrades must have guessed what was gripping their leader around that
time.  Nothing else could have induced Smith, for instance, to say, as he did to Hugh, while
they were resting in preparation for the last half of the game to start in:

"I'm awfully ashamed of that rotten run I made, Hugh, when you handed me the rubber so handsomely.
If I'd known my business as I should I'd have landed it in the wire cage as snug as anything.
But I fumbled, and that Conway got it away from me, the robber.  I'm no good, Hugh; and I'd
give a heap if only you could kick me out of the game, and get a better substitute."

  One word from the coach as
he strode forward Nick would never forget as long as he lived; it was a word of confidence;
and, remembering how Mr. Leonard had at one time detested and distrusted this boy, it meant
everything to Nick.

The game started again after the lapse of seven minutes.

Belleville considered that they had "the edge" on the visitors, and immediately went at it
as though bent on adding considerably to the number of goals marked to their credit.  But almost
immediately it was discovered that the infusion of new blood had somehow altered the complexion
of things greatly.

own the whole town if he was so minded.  I'd give a heap if I was standing in his shoes this
same day.  He'll be a hero, as sure as he used to be the town scapegrace!"

It was just that way up to the time the referee signaled that the last half of the game had
been played to a finish.  Nick seemed capable of doing almost as he pleased.  Whenever he got
possession of the puck it was, as one enthusiastic Scranton boy whooped, a "regular procession."
The Belleville lads just couldn't touch him.  His actions bewildered them, so that they were
continually becoming mixed up with their own side when they thought to corner Nick and the puck.

The score?

Well, it seemed too bad that after such a brilliant beginning Belleville should fall so low,
and see the terrible figures, thirteen to seven, marked up against them.

In the annals of sport, as chronicled at Scranton High, that contest would always be known
as the "Battle of Winchester," just because, as in the Civil War, when the Union army was in
retreat and demoralized, the coming of a single man, General Phil Sheridan, caused them to
turn about, and presently win a conclusive and overwhelming victory. If everybody fourthly, whenever
