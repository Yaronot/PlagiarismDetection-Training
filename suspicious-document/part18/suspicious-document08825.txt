Commenting on the present attitude of professed Christians toward the world, a leading secular
journal says: “Insensibly the church has yielded to the spirit of the age, and adapted its
forms of worship to modern wants.” “All things, indeed, that help to make religion attractive,
the church now employs as its instruments.” And a writer in the New York Independent speaks
thus concerning Methodism as it is: “The line of separation between the godly and the irreligious
fades out into a kind of penumbra, and zealous men on both sides are toiling to obliterate
all difference between their modes of action and enjoyment.” “The popularity of religion tends
vastly to increase the number of those who would secure its benefits without squarely meeting
its duties.”

Says Howard Crosby: “It is a matter of deep concern that we find Christ’s church so little
fulfilling the designs of its Lord. Just as the ancient Jews let a familiar intercourse with
the idolatrous nations steal away their hearts from God, ... so the church of Jesus now is,
by its false partnerships with an unbelieving world, giving up the divine methods of its true
life, and yielding itself to the pernicious, though often plausible, habits of a Christless
society, using the arguments and reaching the conclusions which are foreign to the revelation
of God, and directly antagonistic to all growth in grace.”(639)

In this tide of worldliness and pleasure-seeking, self-denial and self-sacrifice for Christ’s
sake are almost wholly lost. “Some of the men and women now in active life in our churches
were educated, when children, to make sacrifices in order to be able to give or do something
for Christ.” But “if funds are wanted now, ... nobody must be called on to give. Oh, no! have
a fair, tableaux, mock trial, antiquarian supper, or something to eat—anything to amuse the
people.”

Governor Washburn, of Wisconsin, in his annual message, Jan. 9, 1873, declared: “Some law seems
to be required to break up the schools where gamblers are made. These are everywhere. Even
the church (unwittingly, no doubt) is sometimes found doing the work of the devil. Gift concerts,
gift enterprises and raffles, sometimes in aid of religious or charitable objects, but often
for less worthy purposes, lotteries, prize packages, etc., are all devices to obtain money
without value received. Nothing is so demoralizing or intoxicating, particularly to the young,
as the acquisition of money or property without labor. Respectable people engaging in these
chance enterprises, and easing their consciences with the reflection that the money is to go
to a good object, it is not strange that the youth of the State should so often fall into the
habits which the excitement of games of hazard is almost certain to engender.”

The spirit of worldly conformity is invading the churches throughout Christendom. Friendship
with the world corrupts her faith, and in her turn she exerts a corrupting influence upon the
world by teaching doctrines which are opposed to the plainest statements of Holy Writ.

The fact that a few fanatics worked their way into the ranks of Adventists is no more a reason
to decide that the movement was not of God, than was the presence of fanatics and deceivers
in the church in Paul’s or Luther’s day a sufficient excuse for condemning their work. Let
the people of God arouse out of sleep, and begin in earnest the work of repentance and reformation;
let them search the Scriptures to learn the truth as it is in Jesus; let them make an entire
consecration to God, and evidence will not be wanting that Satan is still active and vigilant.
With all possible deception he will manifest his power, calling to his aid all the fallen angels
of his realm.

It was not the proclamation of the second advent that created fanaticism and division. These
appeared in the summer of 1844, when Adventists were in a state of doubt and perplexity concerning
their real position. The preaching of the first angel’s message and of the “midnight cry” tended
directly to repress fanaticism and dissension. Those who participated in these solemn movements
were in harmony; their hearts were filled with love for one another, and for Jesus, whom they
expected soon to see. The one faith, the one blessed hope, lifted them above the control of
any human influence, and proved a shield against the assaults of Satan.

“While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. Reckoning from the autumn of 457,
the 2300 years terminate in the autumn of 1844.(650)

Arguments drawn from the Old Testament types also pointed to the autumn as the time when the
event represented by the “cleansing of the sanctuary” must take place. This was made very clear
as attention was given to the manner in which the types relating to the first advent of Christ
had been fulfilled.

The slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death of Christ. Says Paul, “Christ our
passover is sacrificed for us.”(651) The sheaf of first-fruits, which at the time of the Passover
was waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection of Christ. Paul says, in speaking
of the resurrection of the Lord, and of all His people, “Christ the first-fruits; afterward
they that are Christ’s at His coming.”(652) Like the wave-sheaf, which was the first ripe grain
gathered before the harvest, Christ is the first-fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed
ones that at the future resurrection shall be gathered into the garner of God.

These types were fulfilled, not only as to the event, but as to the time. On the fourteenth
day of the first Jewish month, the very day and month on which, for fifteen long centuries,
the Passover lamb had been slain, Christ, having eaten the Passover with His disciples, instituted
that feast which was to commemorate His own death as “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world.” That same night He was taken by wicked hands, to be crucified and slain.
And as the antitype of the wave-sheaf, our Lord was raised from the dead on the third day,
“the first-fruits of them that slept,”(653) a sample of all the resurrected just, whose “vile
body” shall be changed, and “fashioned like unto His glorious body.”(654)

In like manner, the types which relate to the second advent must be fulfilled at the time pointed
out in the symbolic service. Under the Mosaic system, the cleansing of the sanctuary, or the
great day of atonement, occurred on the tenth day of the seventh Jewish month,(655) when the
high priest, having made an atonement for all Israel, and thus removed their sins from the
sanctuary, came forth and blessed the people. So it was believed that Christ, our great High
Priest, would appear to purify the earth by the destruction of sin and sinners, and to bless
His waiting people with immortality. The tenth day of the seventh month, the great day of atonement,
the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary, which in the year 1844 fell upon the twenty-second
of October, was regarded as the time of the Lord’s coming. This was in harmony with the proofs
already presented, that the 2300 days would terminate in the autumn, and the conclusion seemed
irresistible.

In the parable of Matthew 25 the time of waiting and slumber is followed by the coming of the
bridegroom. This was in accordance with the arguments just presented, both from prophecy and
from the types. They carried strong conviction of their truthfulness; and the “midnight cry”
was heralded by thousands of believers.

Like a tidal wave the movement swept over the land. From city to city, from village to village,
and into remote country places it went, until the waiting people of God were fully aroused.
Fanaticism disappeared before this proclamation, like early frost before the rising sun. The was rather solemn

 The apostle Paul, in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, says: “Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
service, and a worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary. “Let them make
Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them,”(669) was the direction given to Moses while in
the mount with God. The Israelites were journeying through the wilderness, and the tabernacle
was so constructed that it could be removed from place to place; yet it was a structure of
great magnificence. Its walls consisted of upright boards heavily plated with gold, and set
in sockets of silver, while the roof was formed of a series of curtains, or coverings, the
outer of skins, the innermost of fine linen beautifully wrought with figures of cherubim. Besides
the outer court, which contained the altar of burnt-offering, the tabernacle itself consisted
of two apartments called the holy and the most holy place, separated by a rich and beautiful
curtain, or veil; a similar veil closed the entrance to the first apartment.

In the holy place was the candlestick, on the south, with its seven lamps giving light to the
sanctuary both by day and by night; on the north stood the table of showbread; and before the
veil separating the holy from the most holy was the golden altar of incense, from which the
cloud of fragrance, with the prayers of Israel, was daily ascending before God.

In the most holy place stood the ark, a chest of precious wood overlaid with gold, the depository
of the two tables of stone upon which God had inscribed the law of ten commandments. Above
the ark, and forming the cover to the sacred chest, was the mercy-seat, a magnificent piece
of workmanship, surmounted by two cherubim, one at each end, and all wrought of solid gold.
In this apartment the divine presence was manifested in the cloud of glory between the cherubim.

 This is the mystery
of mercy into which angels desire to look,—that God can be just while He justifies the repenting
sinner, and renews His intercourse with the fallen race; that Christ could stoop to raise unnumbered
multitudes from the abyss of ruin, and clothe them with the spotless garments of His own righteousness,
to unite with angels who have never fallen, and to dwell forever in the presence of God.

The work of Christ as man’s intercessor is presented in that beautiful prophecy of Zechariah
concerning Him “whose name is The Branch.” Says the prophet: “He shall build the temple of
the Lord; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His [the Father’s] throne;
and He shall be a priest upon His throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.”(677)

“He shall build the temple of the Lord.” By His sacrifice and mediation, Christ is both the
foundation and the builder of the church of God. Through the eternal ages, the song of the
ransomed ones will be, “Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
... to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever.”(679)

He “shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a priest upon His throne.” Not now
“upon the throne of His glory;” the kingdom of glory has not yet been ushered in. Not until
His work as a mediator shall be ended, will God “give unto Him the throne of His father David,”
a kingdom of which “there shall be no end.”(680) As a priest, Christ is now set down with the
Father in His throne.(681) Upon the throne with the eternal, self-existent One, is He who “hath
borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” who “was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin,” that He might be “able to succor them that are tempted.” “If any man sin,
we have an Advocate with the Father.”(682) His intercession is that of a pierced and broken
body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands, the pierced side, the marred feet, plead for fallen
man, whose redemption was purchased at such infinite cost.

“And the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.” The love of the Father, no less than
of the Son, is the fountain of salvation for the lost race. The term “sanctuary,” as used in
the Bible, refers, first, to the tabernacle built by Moses, as a pattern of heavenly things;
and, secondly, to the “true tabernacle” in heaven, to which the earthly sanctuary pointed.
At the death of Christ the typical service ended. The “true tabernacle” in heaven is the sanctuary
of the new covenant. And as the prophecy of Dan. 8:14 is fulfilled in this dispensation, the
sanctuary to which it refers must be the sanctuary of the new covenant. Engineering is because

ISAIAH.
 This work of examination of character, of determining who are prepared for the kingdom
of God, is that of the investigative judgment, the closing work in the sanctuary above.

When the work of investigation shall be ended, when the cases of those who in all ages have
professed to be followers of Christ have been examined and decided, then, and not till then,
probation will close, and the door of mercy will be shut. Thus in the one short sentence, “They
that were ready went in with Him to the marriage, and the door was shut,” we are carried down
through the Saviour’s final ministration, to the time when the great work for man’s salvation
shall be completed.

In the service of the earthly sanctuary, which, as we have seen, is a figure of the service
in the heavenly, when the high priest on the day of atonement entered the most holy place,
the ministration in the first apartment ceased. God commanded, “There shall be no man in the
tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until
he come out.”(712) So when Christ entered the holy of holies to perform the closing work of
the atonement, He ceased His ministration in the first apartment. But when the ministration
in the first apartment ended, the ministration in the second apartment began. When in the typical
service the high priest left the holy on the day of atonement, he went in before God to present
the blood of the sin-offering in behalf of all Israel who truly repented of their sins. So
Christ had only completed one part of His work as our intercessor, to enter upon another portion
of the work, and He still pleaded His blood before the Father in behalf of sinners.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, thousands of non-conformist ministers were
forced to leave their churches, and many, both of pastors and people, were subjected to fine,
imprisonment, torture, and martyrdom.

It was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the civil government, and this
prepared the way for the development of the papacy,—the beast. Said Paul, “There” shall “come
a falling away, ... and that man of sin be revealed.”(744) So apostasy in the church will prepare
the way for the image to the beast.

The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will exist a state of religious
declension similar to that in the first centuries. “In the last days perilous times shall come.

The wide diversity of belief in the Protestant churches is regarded by many as decisive proof
that no effort to secure a forced uniformity can ever be made. But there has been for years,
in churches of the Protestant faith, a strong and growing sentiment in favor of a union based
upon common points of doctrine. To secure such a union, the discussion of subjects upon which
all were not agreed—however important they might be from a Bible standpoint—must necessarily
be waived.

Charles Beecher, in a sermon in the year 1846, declared that the ministry of “the evangelical
Protestant denominations” is “not only formed all the way up under a tremendous pressure of
merely human fear, but they live, and move, and breathe in a state of things radically corrupt,
and appealing every hour to every baser element of their nature to hush up the truth, and bow
the knee to the power of apostasy. Was not this the way things went with Rome? Are we not living
her life over again? And what do we see just ahead? Another general council! A world’s convention!
Evangelical alliance, and universal creed!”(748) When this shall be gained, then, in the effort
to secure complete uniformity, it will be only a step to the resort to force.

When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such points of doctrine as are
held by them in common, shall influence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their
institutions, then Protestant America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and
the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result. The “image to the
beast” represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the Protestant
churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas. The “mark
of the beast” still remains to be defined.

After the warning against the worship of the beast and his image, the prophecy declares, “Here
are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” Since those who keep God’s
commandments are thus placed in contrast with those that worship the beast and his image and
receive his mark, it follows that the keeping of God’s law, on the one hand, and its violation,
on the other, will make the distinction between the worshipers of God and the worshipers of
the beast.

The special characteristic of the beast, and therefore of his image, is the breaking of God’s
commandments. Says Daniel, of the little horn, the papacy, “He shall think to change the times
and the law.”(750) And Paul styled the same power the “man of sin,” who was to exalt himself
above God. One prophecy is a complement of the other. Only by changing God’s law could the
papacy exalt itself above God; whoever should understandingly keep the law as thus changed
would be giving supreme honor to that power by which the change was made. Such an act of obedience
to papal laws would be a mark of allegiance to the pope in the place of God.

The papacy has attempted to change the law of God. The second commandment, forbidding image
worship, has been dropped from the law, and the fourth commandment has been so changed as to
authorize the observance of the first instead of the seventh day as the Sabbath. But papists
urge, as a reason for omitting the second commandment, that it is unnecessary, being included
in the first, and that they are giving the law exactly as God designed it to be understood.
This cannot be the change foretold by the prophet. An intentional, deliberate change is presented:
“He shall think to change the times and the law.” The change in the fourth commandment exactly
fulfils the prophecy. For this the only authority claimed is that of the church. Here the papal
power openly sets itself above God.

While the worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by their regard for the fourth
commandment,—since this is the sign of His creative power, and the witness to His claim upon
man’s reverence and homage,—the worshipers of the beast will be distinguished by their efforts
to tear down the Creator’s memorial, to exalt the institution of Rome. It was in behalf of
the Sunday that popery first asserted its arrogant claims;(751) and its first resort to the
power of the state was to compel the observance of Sunday as “the Lord’s day.” But the Bible
points to the seventh day, and not to the first, as the Lord’s day. Said Christ, “The Son of
man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” The fourth commandment declares, “The seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord.” And by the prophet Isaiah the Lord designates it, “My holy day.”(752)

The claim so often put forth, that Christ changed the Sabbath, is disproved by His own words.
This is plainly stated in publications issued by the American Tract Society and the American
Sunday-school Union. One of these works acknowledges “the complete silence of the New Testament
so far as any explicit command for the Sabbath [Sunday, the first day of the week] or definite
rules for its observance are concerned.”(754)

Another says: “Up to the time of Christ’s death, no change had been made in the day;”(755)
and, “so far as the record shows, they [the apostles] did not ... give any explicit command
enjoining the abandonment of the seventh-day Sabbath, and its observance on the first day of
the week.”(756)

Roman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the Sabbath was made by their church, and declare
that Protestants, by observing the Sunday, are recognizing her power. "whenever that metropolis is conscious

The work of Sabbath reform to be accomplished in the last days is foretold in the prophecy
of Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for My salvation is near
to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. And upon those who then honor the Sabbath, a
blessing is pronounced. Thus the obligation of the fourth commandment extends past the crucifixion,
resurrection, and ascension of Christ, to the time when His servants should preach to all nations
the message of glad tidings.

The Lord commands by the same prophet, “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.”(763)
The seal of God’s law is found in the fourth commandment. This only, of all the ten, brings
to view both the name and the title of the Lawgiver. It declares Him to be the Creator of the
heavens and the earth, and thus shows His claim to reverence and worship above all others.
Aside from this precept, there is nothing in the decalogue to show by whose authority the law
is given. When the Sabbath was changed by the papal power, the seal was taken from the law.
The disciples of Jesus are called upon to restore it, by exalting the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment to its rightful position as the Creator’s memorial and the sign of His authority.

“To the law and to the testimony.” While conflicting doctrines and theories abound, the law
of God is the one unerring rule by which all opinions, doctrines, and theories are to be tested.
The breach was made in the law of God when the Sabbath was changed by the Roman power. But
the time has come for that divine institution to be restored. The breach is to be repaired,
and the foundation of many generations to be raised up.

Hallowed by the Creator’s rest and blessing, the Sabbath was kept by Adam in his innocence
in holy Eden; by Adam, fallen yet repentant, when he was driven from his happy estate. It was
kept by all the patriarchs, from Abel to righteous Noah, to Abraham, to Jacob. When the chosen
people were in bondage in Egypt, many, in the midst of prevailing idolatry, lost their knowledge
of God’s law; but when the Lord delivered Israel, He proclaimed His law in awful grandeur to
the assembled multitude, that they might know His will, and fear and obey Him forever.

From that day to the present, the knowledge of God’s law has been preserved in the earth, and
the Sabbath of the fourth commandment has been kept. Though the “man of sin” succeeded in trampling
under foot God’s holy day, yet even in the period of his supremacy there were, hidden in secret
places, faithful souls who paid it honor. Since the Reformation, there have been some in every
generation to maintain its observance. Though often in the midst of reproach and persecution,
a constant testimony has been borne to the perpetuity of the law of God, and the sacred obligation
of the creation Sabbath.

These truths, as presented in Revelation 14 in connection with the “everlasting gospel,” will
distinguish the church of Christ at the time of His appearing. For as the result of the threefold
message it is announced, “Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
Jesus.” And this message is the last to be given before the coming of the Lord. Immediately
following its proclamation, the Son of man is seen by the prophet, coming in glory to reap
the harvest of the earth.

Those who received the light concerning the sanctuary and the immutability of the law of God,
were filled with joy and wonder, as they saw the beauty and harmony of the system of truth
that opened to their understanding. They desired that the light which appeared to them so precious
might be imparted to all Christians; and they could not but believe that it would be joyfully
accepted. ". Satan." Faineance "(.):" noddle "transition". "Do" Interlocutor ".-()". "(,)"-lyre, wind,

 The old life of alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation,
of faith and love, has begun. Then “the righteousness of the law” will “be fulfilled in us,
who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”(791) And the language of the soul will
be, “O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day.”(792)

“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.”(793) Without the law, men have no just
conception of the purity and holiness of God, or of their own guilt and uncleanness. They have
no true conviction of sin, and feel no need of repentance. Not seeing their lost condition
as violators of God’s law, they do not realize their need of the atoning blood of Christ. The
hope of salvation is accepted without a radical change of heart or reformation of life. Thus
superficial conversions abound, and multitudes are joined to the church who have never been
united to Christ.

Erroneous theories of sanctification, also, springing from neglect or rejection of the divine
law, have a prominent place in the religious movements of the day. These theories are both
false in doctrine and dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so generally
finding favor, renders it doubly essential that all have a clear understanding of what the
Scriptures teach upon this point.

True sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Thessalonian
church, declares, “This is the will of God, even your sanctification.” And he prays, “The very
God of peace sanctify you wholly.”(794) The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is, and
how it is to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples, “Sanctify them through Thy
truth: Thy word is truth.”(795) And Paul teaches that believers are to be “sanctified by the
Holy Ghost.”(796) What is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples, “When He,
the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.”(797) And the psalmist says,
“Thy law is the truth.” By the word and the Spirit of God are opened to men the great principles
of righteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is “holy, and just, and good,”
a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a character formed by obedience to that
law will be holy. Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He says, “I have kept My
Father’s commandments.” “I do always those things that please Him.”(798) The followers of Christ
are to become like Him,—by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles
of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.

This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power of the indwelling
Spirit of God. Paul admonishes believers, “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”(799) The Christian
will feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is
where Christ’s help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith
exclaims, “Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”(800)

The Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is progressive. When in conversion
the sinner finds peace with God through the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has
but just begun. Like Moses, they have had a view of the awful majesty of holiness, and they
see their own unworthiness in contrast with the purity and exalted perfection of the Infinite One.

The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life was filled up with
noble service for his Master. He was a man “greatly beloved”(803) of Heaven. They feel that
it was their sin which caused the agony that broke the heart of the Son of God, and this thought
will lead them to self-abasement. Equitable so much is gender, her handmaid, or subordinate--

Satan invents unnumbered schemes to occupy our minds, that they may not dwell upon the very
work with which we ought to be best acquainted. The arch-deceiver hates the great truths that
bring to view an atoning sacrifice and an all-powerful Mediator. He knows that with him everything
depends on his diverting minds from Jesus and His truth.

Those who would share the benefits of the Saviour’s mediation should permit nothing to interfere
with their duty to perfect holiness in the fear of God. The precious hours, instead of being
given to pleasure, to display, or to gain-seeking, should be devoted to an earnest, prayerful
study of the Word of truth. The subject of the sanctuary and the investigative judgment should
be clearly understood by the people of God. All need a knowledge for themselves of the position
and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise, it will be impossible for them to exercise
the faith which is essential at this time, or to occupy the position which God designs them
to fill. Every individual has a soul to save or to lose. Each has a case pending at the bar
of God. Each must meet the great Judge face to face. How important, then, that every mind contemplate
often the solemn scene when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, when, with
Daniel, every individual must stand in his lot, at the end of the days.

All who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear testimony of the great truths
which God has committed to them. The sanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ’s work
in behalf of men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to view the plan of
redemption, bringing us down to the very close of time, and revealing the triumphant issue
of the contest between righteousness and sin. It is of the utmost importance that all should
thoroughly investigate these subjects, and be able to give an answer to every one that asketh
them a reason of the hope that is in them.

The intercession of Christ in man’s behalf in the sanctuary above is as essential to the plan
of salvation as was His death upon the cross. By His death He began that work which after His
resurrection He ascended to complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the veil, “whither
the Forerunner is for us entered.”(869) There the light from the cross of Calvary is reflected.
There we may gain a clearer insight into the mysteries of redemption. The salvation of man
is accomplished at an infinite expense to heaven; the sacrifice made is equal to the broadest
demands of the broken law of God. Jesus has opened the way to the Father’s throne, and through
His mediation the sincere desire of all who come to Him in faith may be presented before God.

“He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall
have mercy.”(870) If those who hide and excuse their faults could see how Satan exults over
them, how he taunts Christ and holy angels with their course, they would make haste to confess
their sins and to put them away. Through defects in the character, Satan works to gain control
of the whole mind, and he knows that if these defects are cherished, he will succeed. Therefore
he is constantly seeking to deceive the followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that it
is impossible for them to overcome. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.

We are now living in the great day of atonement. In the typical service, while the high priest
was making the atonement for Israel, all were required to afflict their souls by repentance
of sin and humiliation before the Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In like
manner, all who would have their names retained in the book of life, should now, in the few
remaining days of their probation, afflict their souls before God by sorrow for sin and true
repentance. There must be deep, faithful searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit indulged
by so many professed Christians must be put away. There is earnest warfare before all who would
subdue the evil tendencies that strive for the mastery. The work of preparation is an individual
work. We are not saved in groups. The purity and devotion of one will not offset the want of
these qualities in another. Arrayed of her is bridal Imogene apartments veil of white, should abound concerning

 Nothing
is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God was in no wise responsible for the entrance
of sin; that there was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in the divine
government, that gave occasion for the uprising of rebellion. Sin is an intruder, for whose
presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it, is to defend
it. Could excuse for it be found, or cause be shown for its existence, it would cease to be
sin. Our only definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is “the transgression
of the law,” it is the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of love which is
the foundation of the divine government.

Before the entrance of evil, there was peace and joy throughout the universe. All was in perfect
harmony with the Creator’s will. Love for God was supreme, love for one another impartial.
Christ the Word, the only begotten of God, was one with the eternal Father,—one in nature,
in character, and in purpose,—the only being in all the universe that could enter into all
the counsels and purposes of God. By Christ, the Father wrought in the creation of all heavenly
beings. “By Him were all things created, that are in heaven, ... whether they be thrones, or
dominions, or principalities, or powers;”(879) and to Christ, equally with the Father, all
heaven gave allegiance.

The law of love being the foundation of the government of God, the happiness of all created
beings depended upon their perfect accord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires
from all His creatures the service of love,—homage that springs from an intelligent appreciation
of His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced allegiance, and to all He grants freedom
of will, that they may render Him voluntary service.

But there was one that chose to pervert this freedom. Sin originated with him who, next to
Christ, had been most honored of God, and who stood highest in power and glory among the inhabitants
of heaven. "Brother" had print in 1795, abstractor. Erskine. The was accumulate his "," element "Helen"

Now the guilt of Satan stood forth without excuse. He had revealed his true character as a
liar and a murderer. It was seen that the very same spirit with which he ruled the children
of men, who were under his power, he would have manifested had he been permitted to control
the inhabitants of heaven. He had claimed that the transgression of God’s law would bring liberty
and exaltation; but it was seen to result in bondage and degradation.

Satan’s lying charges against the divine character and government appeared in their true light.
He had accused God of seeking merely the exaltation of Himself in requiring submission and
obedience from His creatures, and had declared that while the Creator exacted self-denial from
all others, He Himself practised no self-denial and made no sacrifice. Now it was seen that
for the salvation of a fallen and sinful race, the Ruler of the universe had made the greatest
sacrifice which love could make; for “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.”(886)
It was seen, also, that while Lucifer had opened the door for the entrance of sin, by his desire
for honor and supremacy, Christ had, in order to destroy sin, humbled Himself, and become obedient
unto death.

God had manifested His abhorrence of the principles of rebellion. All heaven saw His justice
revealed, both in the condemnation of Satan and in the redemption of man. Lucifer had declared
that if the law of God was changeless, and its penalty could not be remitted, every transgressor
must be forever debarred from the Creator’s favor. He had claimed that the sinful race were
placed beyond redemption, and were therefore his rightful prey. But the death of Christ was
an argument in man’s behalf that could not be overthrown. The penalty of the law fell upon
Him who was equal with God, and man was free to accept the righteousness of Christ, and by
a life of penitence and humiliation to triumph, as the Son of God had triumphed, over the power
of Satan. Thus God is just, and yet the justifier of all who believe in Jesus.

But it was not merely to accomplish the redemption of man that Christ came to the earth to
suffer and to die. He came to “magnify the law” and to “make it honorable.” Not alone that
the inhabitants of this world might regard the law as it should be regarded; but it was to
demonstrate to all the worlds of the universe that God’s law is unchangeable. Could its claims
have been set aside, then the Son of God need not have yielded up His life to atone for its
transgression. The death of Christ proves it immutable. And the sacrifice to which infinite
love impelled the Father and the Son, that sinners might be redeemed, demonstrates to all the
universe—what nothing less than this plan of atonement could have sufficed to do—that justice
and mercy are the foundation of the law and government of God.

In the final execution of the judgment it will be seen that no cause for sin exists. When the
Judge of all the earth shall demand of Satan, “Why hast thou rebelled against Me, and robbed
Me of the subjects of My kingdom?” the originator of evil can render no excuse. Every mouth
will be stopped, and all the hosts of rebellion will be speechless.

The cross of Calvary, while it declares the law immutable, proclaims to the universe that the
wages of sin is death. In the Saviour’s expiring cry, “It is finished,” the death-knell of
Satan was rung. The great controversy which had been so long in progress was then decided,
and the final eradication of evil was made certain. But thou-- apparell is saved in Mortality; impossible

yet have continued review in Spain, though, like in these others
of kind, its monitoring is daily conjugal since the change, and of
the communion is required between the two christians.

 The spirit which put Christ to death moves the wicked to destroy His followers.
All this is foreshadowed in that first prophecy, “I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between thy seed and her seed.” And this will continue to the close of time.

Satan summons all his forces, and throws his whole power into the combat. Why is it that he
meets with no greater resistance? Why are the soldiers of Christ so sleepy and indifferent?
Because they have so little real connection with Christ; because they are so destitute of His
Spirit. Sin is not to them repulsive and abhorrent, as it was to their Master. They do not
meet it, as did Christ, with decisive and determined resistance. They do not realize the exceeding
evil and malignity of sin, and they are blinded both to the character and the power of the
prince of darkness. I could the foliage does understand the answer, and ultimate adventures.

 They
cannot see that such company is calculated to do them harm; and while all the time assimilating
to the world in character, words, and actions, they are becoming more and more blinded.

Conformity to worldly customs converts the church to the world; it never converts the world
to Christ. Familiarity with sin will inevitably cause it to appear less repulsive. He who chooses
to associate with the servants of Satan, will soon cease to fear their master. The prophecy, into

 All who
are actively engaged in the cause of God, seeking to unveil the deceptions of the evil one
and to present Christ before the people, will be able to join in the testimony of Paul, in
which he speaks of serving the Lord with all humility of mind, with many tears and temptations.

Satan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle temptations; but he was repulsed in
every conflict. Those battles were fought in our behalf; those victories make it possible for
us to conquer. Christ will give strength to all who seek it. No man without his own consent
can be overcome by Satan. The tempter has no power to control the will or to force the soul
to sin. He may distress, but he cannot contaminate. He can cause agony, but not defilement.
The fact that Christ has conquered should inspire His followers with courage to fight manfully
the battle against sin and Satan.

31. AGENCY OF EVIL SPIRITS.

The connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministration of angels of God,
and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly revealed in the Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven
with human history. There is a growing tendency to disbelief in the existence of evil spirits,
while the holy angels that “minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation,”(897) are regarded
by many as the spirits of the dead. But the Scriptures not only teach the existence of angels,
both good and evil, but present unquestionable proof that these are not the disembodied spirits
of dead men. Angels are in nature superior to men; for the psalmist says that man was made
“a little lower than the angels.”(899)

We are informed in Scripture as to the number, and the power and glory, of the heavenly beings,
of their connection with the government of God, and also of their relation to the work of redemption. ”.

It is a masterpiece of Satan’s deceptions to keep the minds of men searching and conjecturing
in regard to that which God has not made known, and which He does not intend that we shall
understand. It was thus that Lucifer lost his place in heaven. He became dissatisfied because
all the secrets of God’s purposes were not confided to him, and he entirely disregarded that
which was revealed concerning his own work in the lofty position assigned him. By arousing
the same discontent in the angels under his command, he caused their fall. Now he seeks to
imbue the minds of men with the same spirit, and to lead them also to disregard the direct
commands of God.

Those who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting truths of the Bible, are continually seeking
for pleasing fables that will quiet the conscience. The less spiritual, self-denying, and humiliating
the doctrines presented, the greater the favor with which they are received. These persons
degrade the intellectual powers to serve their carnal desires. Too wise in their own conceit
to search the Scriptures with contrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine guidance, they
have no shield from delusion. Satan is ready to supply the heart’s desire, and he palms off
his deceptions in the place of truth. It was thus that the papacy gained its power over the
minds of men; and by rejection of the truth because it involves a cross, Protestants are following
the same path. All who neglect the word of God to study convenience and policy, that they may
not be at variance with the world, will be left to receive damnable heresy for religious truth.
Every conceivable form of error will be accepted by those who wilfully reject the truth. He
who looks with horror upon one deception will readily receive another.

Among the most successful agencies of the great deceiver are the delusive teachings and lying
wonders of Spiritualism. Disguised as an angel of light, he spreads his nets where least suspected.
If men would but study the Book of God with earnest prayer that they might understand it, they
would not be left in darkness to receive false doctrines. But as they reject the truth, they
fall a prey to deception.

Another dangerous error is the doctrine that denies the deity of Christ, claiming that He had
no existence before His advent to this world. This theory is received with favor by a large
class who profess to believe the Bible; yet it directly contradicts the plainest statements
of our Saviour concerning His relationship with the Father, His divine character, and His pre-existence.
It cannot be entertained without the most unwarranted wresting of the Scriptures. It not only
lowers man’s conceptions of the work of redemption, but undermines faith in the Bible as a
revelation from God. While this renders it the more dangerous, it makes it also harder to meet.
If men reject the testimony of the inspired Scriptures concerning the deity of Christ, it is
in vain to argue the point with them; for no argument, however conclusive, could convince them.

Still another subtle and mischievous error is the fast-spreading belief that Satan has no existence
as a personal being; that the name is used in Scripture merely to represent men’s evil thoughts
and desires.

The teaching so widely echoed from popular pulpits, that the second advent of Christ is His
coming to each individual at death, is a device to divert the minds of men from His personal
coming in the clouds of heaven. For years Satan has thus been saying, “Behold, He is in the
secret chambers,”(922) and many souls have been lost by accepting this deception.

Again, worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men of science claim that there
can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a violation of law, a miracle, and that
miracles have no existence. The universe, say they, is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself
does nothing contrary to these laws. Thus they represent God as bound by His own laws—as if
the operation of divine laws could exclude divine freedom. Such teaching is opposed to the
testimony of the Scriptures. Were not miracles wrought by Christ and His apostles? The same
compassionate Saviour lives to-day, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of faith as
when He walked visibly among men. The natural co-operates with the supernatural. It is a part
of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow
did we not thus ask.

Innumerable are the erroneous doctrines and fanciful ideas that are obtaining among the churches
of Christendom. It is impossible to estimate the evil results of removing one of the landmarks
fixed by the word of God. Few who venture to do this stop with the rejection of a single truth.
The majority continue to set aside one after another of the principles of truth, until they
become actual infidels.

The errors of popular theology have driven many a soul to skepticism, who might otherwise have
been a believer in the Scriptures. It is impossible for him to accept doctrines which outrage
his sense of justice, mercy, and benevolence: and since these are represented as the teaching
of the Bible, he refuses to receive it as the word of God.

And this is the object which Satan seeks to accomplish. There is nothing that he desires more
than to destroy confidence in God and in His word. Satan stands at the head of the great army
of doubters, and he works to the utmost of his power to beguile souls into his ranks. It is
becoming fashionable to doubt. There is a large class by whom the word of God is looked upon
with distrust for the same reason as was its Author,—because it reproves and condemns sin.
Those who are unwilling to obey its requirements, endeavor to overthrow its authority. They
read the Bible, or listen to its teachings as presented from the sacred desk, merely to find
fault with the Scriptures or with the sermon. Not a few become infidels in order to justify
or excuse themselves in neglect of duty. Others adopt skeptical principles from pride and indolence.
Too ease-loving to distinguish themselves by accomplishing anything worthy of honor, which
requires effort and self-denial, they aim to secure a reputation for superior wisdom by criticising
the Bible. There is much which the finite mind, unenlightened by divine wisdom, is powerless
to comprehend; and thus they find occasion to criticise. There are many who seem to feel that
it is a virtue to stand on the side of unbelief, skepticism, and infidelity. But underneath
an appearance of candor, it will be found that such persons are actuated by self-confidence
and pride. Many delight in finding something in the Scriptures to puzzle the minds of others. 1751:

The theory of eternal torment is one of the false doctrines that constitute the wine of the
abominations of Babylon, of which she makes all nations drink.(939) That ministers of Christ
should have accepted this heresy and proclaimed it from the sacred desk, is indeed a mystery.
They received it from Rome, as they received the false sabbath. True, it has been taught by
great and good men; but the light on this subject had not come to them as it has come to us.
They were responsible only for the light which shone in their time; we are accountable for
that which shines in our day. If we turn from the testimony of God’s word, and accept false
doctrines because our fathers taught them, we fall under the condemnation pronounced upon Babylon;
we are drinking of the wine of her abominations.
