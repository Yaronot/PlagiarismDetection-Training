 General Murray, afterward
Duke of Atholl, held his sword ready to pass it through Lord George's body the instant the
mob rushed in. The Earl of Carnarvon, the grandfather of the present earl, followed him closely
with the same intent.

The indignation of the insulted Commons was extreme, and the distress and displeasure of Lord
George's own family doubtless excessive. The House of Commons had never been thus insulted
before. It is difficult to determine what could be Lord George's motives for the conduct which
led to these awful results, during the whole of which he preserved a composure that bordered
on insensibility; he was a perfect master of himself whilst the city was in flames. Much may
be laid to fanaticism, and the mental derangement which it either produced or evinced. When
too late he tried in vain to abate the fury he had excited, and offered to take his stand by
Lord Rodney's[55] side when the Bank was attacked, to aid that officer, who commanded the Guards,
in its defence.

Lord George then lived in Weibeck Street, Cavendish Square, and tradition assigns as his house
that now occupied by Mr. Newby, the publisher, No. 30, and for many years the house of Count
Woronzoff, the Russian ambassador, who died there. Lord George there prepared for his defence,
which was entrusted to the great Erskine, then in his prime, or, as he was called in caricatures,
with which the shops were full, from his extreme vanity, Counsellor Ego. In February, 1781,
the trial took place, and Lord George was acquitted. He retired to Birmingham, became a Jew,
and lived in that faith, or under the delusion that he did so. The hundreds who perished from
his folly or insanity were avenged in his subsequent imprisonment in Newgate for a libel on
Marie Antoinette, of which he was convicted. He died a very few years after the riots of 1780,
in Newgate, generally condemned, and but little compassionated.

It appears from the letters addressed by Doctor Beanie to the Duchess of Gordon, that she was
not in London during the riots of June, 1780. The poet had been introduced to her by Sir William
Forbes, and frequently visited Gordon Castle. We find him, whilst London was blazing, sending
thither a parcel of Mirrors, the fashionable journal, "Count Fathom," "The Tale of a Tub,"
and the fanciful, forgotten romance by Bishop Berkeley, "Gaudentio di Lucca," to amuse her
solitude. "'Gaudentio,'" he writes, "will amuse you, though there are tedious passages in it.
The whole description of passing the deserts of Africa is particularly excellent." It is singular
that this dream of Bishop Berkeley's of a country fertile and delicious in the centre of Africa
should have been almost realised in our own time by the discoveries of Doctor Livingstone.

To his present of books, Doctor Beattie added a flask of whisky, which he sealed with his usual
seal, "The three graces, whom I take to be your Grace's near relations, as they have the honour,
not only to bear one of your titles, but also to resemble you exceedingly in form, feature,
and manner. If you had lived three thousand years ago, which I am very glad you did not, there
would have been four of them, and you the first. May all happiness attend your Grace!"

This graceful piece of adulation was followed by a tender concern for "her Grace's" health.
A sportive benediction was offered whilst the duchess was at Glenfiddick, a hunting seat in
the heart of the Grampian Hills--a wild, sequestered spot, of which Doctor Beattie was particularly
fond.

"I rejoice in the good weather, in the belief that it extends to Glenfiddick, where I pray
that your Grace may enjoy all the health and happiness that good air, goats' whey, romantic
solitude, and the society of the loveliest children in the world can bestow. 've crossjack,'ah

 Descended in the third degree from Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough,
Georgiana Spencer is said to have resembled her celebrated ancestress in the style of her beauty.
She was born in 1757. Her father, John, created Earl of Spencer in 1765, was the son of the
reprobate "Jack Spencer," as he was styled, the misery at once and the darling of his grandmother,
Sarah, who idolised her Torrismond, as she called him, and left him a considerable portion
of her property. Whilst the loveliness of Sarah descended to Georgiana Spencer, she certainly
inherited somewhat of the talent, the reckless spirits, and the imprudence of her grandfather,
"Jack;" neither could a careful education eradicate these hereditary characteristics.

Her mother was the daughter of a commoner, the Right Honourable Stephen Poyntz, of Midgham,
in Berkshire. This lady was long remembered both by friends and neighbours with veneration.
She was sensible and intelligent, polite, agreeable, and of unbounded charity; but Miss Burney,
who knew her, depicts her as ostentatious in her exertions, and somewhat self-righteous and
vainglorious. When we use alcohol for this room by imbibe it, we accept its action. If we do not

 The duke was standing near a very fine glass lustre in a corner of a room in the
house of people who were not possessed of means sufficient to consider expense as immaterial;
by carelessly lolling back, he threw the lustre back, and it was broken. He was not, however,
in the least disturbed by the accident, but coolly said: "I wonder how I did that!" He then
removed to the opposite corner, and to show, it was supposed, that he had forgotten what he
had done, leaned his head in the same manner, and down came the second lustre. "yes," said mamma,

 Fox then addressed the crowd, and attempted to disperse them;
but at night the mob broke out into acts of fury, illuminated and attacked those houses which
were in sullen darkness.

The next day the prince invited all the rank, beauty, and fashion of the coalition party to
a fete on his lawn. It wad a bright day that 18th of May; and under the delicious shade of
the trees the young and gay forgot, perhaps, in the enchantments of the scene, politics and
elections. Lord North, dressed in blue and buff,--his new livery,--strutted about amid those
who only fifteen months before had execrated and denounced him, until, by the coalition with
Fox, he had made himself their idol. Every one, on this occasion, crowded around the minister,
whose wit was as inexhaustible as his sang-froid, and whose conversation in its playfulness
resembled that of our great premier of 1859. Blue and buff pervaded the garden. Colonel North
(afterward Lord Guildford) and George Byng, hitherto bitter enemies, were seen, dressed alike,
walking together familiarly. The prince was irresistibly fascinating, and nothing could be
more splendid than the fete given by royalty overwhelmed by debt.

As the party were thus enjoying themselves, by a strange coincidence, the famous cream-coloured
horses of George III. were beheld proceeding in solemn state down St. James's Park. His Majesty
was going to Westminster to open Parliament. Nothing but a low wall separated Canton Gardens
from the park, so that the king could not forbear seeing his former minister, his son, and
the successful candidate disporting themselves in all the elation of success.

In the evening Lower Grosvenor Street was blocked up with carriages, out of which gentlemen
and ladies, all in blue and buff, descended to visit the famous Mrs. Crewe, whose husband,
then member for Chester, was created, in 1806, Lord Crewe. This lady was as remarkable for
her accomplishments and her worth as for her beauty; nevertheless, she permitted the admiration
of Fox, who was in the rank of her admirers. The lines he wrote on her were not exaggerated.

The same company that had assembled in the morning at Carlton House now crowded into Grosvenor
Street. Blue and buff were the order of the evening, the Prince of Wales wearing those colours.
After supper he gave a toast,--"True blue and Mrs. Crewe." The room rang with applause. The
hostess rose to return thanks. "True blue, and all of you," was her toast. Nor did the festivities
end here. Canton House some days afterward received all the great world, the "true blues" of
London. The fete, which was of the most varied kind, and of the most magnificent description,
began at noon, went on all night, and was not ended till the next day. Nothing could exceed
its splendour. A costly banquet was prepared for the ladies, on whom his Royal Highness and
the gentlemen waited whilst they were seated at table. Nothing could exceed the grace, the
courtesy, the tact of the prince on these occasions, when he forgot his two hundred thousand
pounds of debt, and added to them. Louis XIV., said an eye-witness, could not have eclipsed
him. This was probably the brightest era in the life of the Duchess of Devonshire. Them do show

In 1824, Lady Elizabeth Foster, then the second Duchess of Devonshire, expired at Rome, where
she had lived many years in almost regal splendour. Amongst her most intimate friends were
the Cardinal Consalvi and Madame Recamier, who were cognisant of the report, which was confirmed
in their minds by the late duke's conduct at her death. Lady Elizabeth, as we shall still by
way of distinction call her, was then so emaciated as to resemble a living spectre; but the
lines of a rare and commanding beauty still remained. Her features were regular and noble,
her eyes magnificent, and her attenuated figure was upright and dignified, with the step of
an empress. Her complexion of marble paleness completed this portrait. Her beautiful arms and
hands were still as white as ivory, though almost like a skeleton's from their thinness. She
used in vain to attempt to disguise their emaciation by wearing bracelets and rings. Though
surrounded by every object of art in which she delighted, by the society, both of the English,
Italian, and French persons of distinction whom she preferred, there was a shade of sadness
on this fascinating woman's brow, as if remembrance forbade her usual calm of life's decline.

Her stepson (so reported), the late duke, treated her with respect and even affection, but
there was an evident reserve between them. At her death he carefully excluded all friends to
whom she could in her last moments confide what might perhaps, at that hour, trouble her conscience.
Her friends, Madame Recamier and the Duc de Laval, were only admitted to bid her farewell when
she was speechless, and a few minutes before she breathed her last.

This circumstance struck them forcibly as confirmatory of the report alluded to; but it must
in candour be stated that the duke's precautions may have originated in another source. His
step-mother was disposed to Romanism, and he may have feared that the zeal of her Catholic
friends should prompt them, if opportunity occurred, to speak to her on the subject of her
faith, and to suggest the adoption of such consolations as their own notions would have thought
indispensable at that awful moment. The point is one that cannot be settled. It may, however,
be remarked, that in disposition, in his wide benevolence and courteous manners, the late duke
greatly resembled the subject of this memoir,--the beautiful, the gifted, but the worldly Georgiana,
Duchess of Devonshire.

THE END.
