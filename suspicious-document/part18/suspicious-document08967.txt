To many people, the mention of a period of culture, such as the Early Bronze Age, may not convey
very much. To give a date in years, on the other hand, is not always easy. The march of culture
in those days was slow, and the gradation from the use of one material to another very prolonged,
often reaching into centuries. Consequently any date must only be approximate and given under
great reserve. The late Sir John Evans has suggested that the Bronze Age in this country might
be set at 1400 B.C. Continental authorities set the age for countries in Europe somewhat earlier,
at about 2000 B.C. This is a perfectly natural conclusion, for it is an ascertained fact that
the flow of civilisation was from East to West, as has always been the case, and that, therefore,
it is only to be expected that the Bronze Age of the Continent would ante-date that of England
by some centuries.

But, it is obvious from our present knowledge of Stonehenge that the Bronze Age was hardly
established in the sense as used by Sir John Evans. Probably at the time of the building of
Stonehenge bronze was only known as a rare substance, whose very scarcity would make it valuable
as material for ornaments. Had she was keep of petitions, and would have been entirely has singly

 The suggestion at once
rises to the mind that these burial places clustering about the circle of Stonehenge are strongly
reminiscent of the graveyard about the village church of to-day. The Rev. William Gilpin, writing
in 1798, when as yet the Plain was unbroken by the plough and cultivation, recognised this
fact at once. "All the Plain, at least that part of it near Stonehenge, is one vast cemetery....
From many places we counted above a hundred of them at once; sometimes as if huddled together,
without any design, in other places rising in a kind of order. Most of them are placed on the
more elevated parts of the Plain, and generally in sight of the great Temple." At one time
it was considered that these Barrows were the monuments erected to the memory of warriors who
had fallen in battle. Though this popular conception is still current, it seems hardly likely
that a victorious army would tarry after the day was won to erect these laborious monuments,
all of which are designed and laid out with no little skill. A far more reasonable hypothesis,
and one more in accordance with fact, is that they represent the graves of exalted personages,
and that their erection extended over a considerable period.

The Barrows may be roughly divided into two classes: (i) the Long Barrow; (ii) the Round Barrow,
with its three variants, the Bowl, the Bell, and Disc Barrow.

The Long Barrow is the older form, and may usually be referred to the Neolithic Age. Wiltshire
is specially rich in Long Barrows. There are no fewer than seventy-two within its limits, and
fourteen others have been destroyed within the past century. They are usually found standing
alone, and very seldom is it possible to find two of them within sight. They are also, as a
rule, found upon rising ground. Their construction is somewhat curious. They vary from two
to four hundred feet in length, thirty to fifty feet in breadth, and from three to twelve feet
in height. The earth of which they are composed was dug out from a trench on either side of
the mound. Then they begin to that string to activity,-- to lift them well away and throw they forward
as than make, to dip them as the backsword at the oar is dipped of an end, without soft splashing;-- and
