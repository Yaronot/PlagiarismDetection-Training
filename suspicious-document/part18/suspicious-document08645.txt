    The second group of famous mothers are mortal women with mortal
    husbands. The wedded wife brings up now the domestic relation,
    which is passingly introduced by the spouse of Hercules, Megara,
    who is simply mentioned. The two chief women of the group are
    Epicaste and Chloris, the one supremely tragic in her motherhood,
    the other reasonably happy. Epicaste is mother of OEdipus, who
    marries her after slaying his own father who is her husband, both
    deeds being done in ignorance; thus the closest domestic ties are
    whelmed into guilt and tragedy, whereof Sophocles has made a
    world-famous use, in his two dramas on the subject of OEdipus.
    Chloris is, on the contrary, the mother of Nestor, not a tragic
    character by any means; also she is mother of Pero, the beautiful
    maiden, "whom all the people around were wooing," and who was
    happily won by an heroic deed. Mark the interest of those
    listeners, Arete and Nausicaa, mother and daughter in this tale.
    Thus the two women, Epicaste and Chloris, have opposite destinies,
    and show the sharp contrasts of life.

    In the third group are two mothers who have a double honor; each
    has borne twins and heroic ones at that; moreover the Gods again
    enter the domestic relation of mortals. Leda's sons are "Castor the
    horseman, and Pollux the boxer," the first being mortal, the second
    immortal, and reputed son of Zeus, who permitted the immortal
    brother to share his immortality with his mortal brother; hence
    "every other day they both are alive, and every other day they both
    are dead." Again the divine gives itself to the human in the spirit
    of true brotherhood; the son of Zeus takes on the ills of mortality
    through fraternal love. The second mother of this group is
    Iphidameia, who declares Neptune to be the father of Otus and
    Ephialtes, of her monstrous twins, "who at the age of nine years
    threatened war upon the Gods," and proposed to storm heaven by
    piling Mount Ossa upon Olympus and Pelion on top of that. Such is
    the contrast: one set of sons is noble, worthy, and "receive honor
    like unto Gods;" the other set is defiant, assailing the divine
    order, and are slain by the arrows of Apollo "ere the down
    blossomed beneath their temples, and covered their chins with
    tender furze."

    c. Such, then, is the account of the mothers, the women who have
    borne children famous in legend. "Title. Myers," state a widow, hither,
    "the't we better come for all that embalmer to have and find the
    cadaver?"
    
    "hunt badly!" state Myers. "i'm the last world to do the always

"why, of education."

"can the violate the precedent?"

"sedately not."

"possibly, once, i'density go to hammer you with the club, and i despatch you'll state me the the corpse

First this major was on part, furiously Myers; and as they rolled over and over these artifact

Myers has alleviate to him since to opportunity that the only resentment that he has against him is

 "It is not yet time to go to sleep," cries Alcinous,
"the night here is unspeakably long," and still further, "I would hold out till daylight,"
listening to thy story.

II. The Trojan Past, then, is the theme; we are to behold the ghosts of those who were famous
during the War at Troy, and immediately afterwards, both men and women. But the women are not
here given a special portion to themselves, but are woven into the general narrative. This
part of the Book is sung for the men, the opposite sex is withdrawn into the background; still
they will be duly mentioned, since the whole conflict is over a woman. Moreover Alcinous wishes
to hear what the heroic men are doing in the future world, whither too he must go.

1. Three Greek shades will pass before us, Agamemnon the Leader, Achilles the Hero, and Ajax
the man of strength. We shall find them placed in a certain contrast with Ulysses, who is shown
greater than any of the three. All have been overwhelmed by fate through their own folly or
weakness, while Ulysses still lives, the master of fate, and beholds them in Hades. Such is
his triumph, which the shades themselves declare.

First comes the soul of Agamemnon, the great King, who has the bond of authority in common
with King Alcinous. He tells the story of his own murder in considerable detail, which story
has been given twice already in the poem. A most impressive event to the Greek mind of Homer's
age; the greatest of the rulers is wretchedly cut off from his Return by his wife Clytæmnestra
and her paramour Ægisthus. This Return is what points the contrast between him and Ulysses;
moreover the contrast is also drawn between the wives of the two men, one the faithless and
the other the faithful woman. Still the wrong of Agamemnon is suggested by himself: "I heard
the piteous voice of Cassandra, whom Clytæmnestra slew, crying for me; I, though dying, grasped
for my sword," to no purpose, however. Surely the wife had her wrongs as well as the husband,
out of which double guilt Æschylus will construct his mighty tragedy.

Next after the Leader, in due order comes the Hero of the Greeks before Troy, Achilles. He
recognizes this descent to Hades as the greatest deed of Ulysses: "What greater deed, rash
man, wilt thou plan next?" It is verily the most wonderful part of his Return, overtopping
anything that Achilles did. Still Ulysses pays him the meed of heroship: "We Argives honored
thee as a God, while living, and now thou art powerful among the dead; therefore do not sorrow
at thy death, O Achilles." But he answers that he would rather be the humblest day laborer
to a poor man than to be King of the Shades. It is not his world, he longs for the realm of
heroic action, here he has no vocation. No Troy to be taken, no Hector to be vanquished down
in Hades; the heroic man must sigh for the Upper World with its activity. Some consolation
he gets from the account which Ulysses gives of his son, who was in the Wooden Horse and distinguished
himself at Troy for bravery. Thus the father lives in his son and "strides off delighted through
the meadow of asphodel." This plant is usually regarded as the Asphodelus ramosus, a kind of
lily with an edible tuberous root, still planted, it is said, on graves, to furnish to the
dead some food which grows in the earth. This ancient custom has been supposed to be the source
of the legend of its being transplanted to Hades.

The third heroic shade is that of Ajax, son of Telamon, with whom Ulysses had a rivalry, the
story of which runs as follows: After the death of Achilles, Thetis his mother offered his
arms, the work of Vulcan, to the worthiest of the remaining Greek heroes. The contest lay between
Ajax and Ulysses. Agamemnon would not decide, but referred the question to the Trojan prisoners
present, asking them which of the two contestants had done them the most injury. They said
Ulysses. Whereupon Ajax went crazy and slew himself. Now he appears in Hades, still unreconciled;
it is really the most wretched lot of all. Ulysses here speaks the reconciling word, growing
tender and imploring; but the hero "answered not, darting away with the other shades into Erebos."
Wherein we may well see how much greater in spirit Ulysses was than his big muscular rival.
He has reached in this respect the true outcome of life's discipline: to have no revenges,
and to speak the word of reconciliation.

In fact the superiority of Ulysses over all these heroes is clearly manifested. He brings no
captive woman home to his domestic hearth, and hence he has a right to count upon Penelope's
fidelity, though certainly he shows himself no saint in his wanderings. Moreover Agamemnon
lacked foresight in his Return, which Ulysses will exhibit in a supreme degree when he first
touches his native soil. The second hero, Achilles, could not conquer Troy, then he could not
conquer Hades; yet both are conquered by Ulysses who is thus the greater. Finally unreconciled
Ajax--all are limited, incomplete, in contrast with the complete, limit-removing Hero, who
has just removed even the limit of Death in the only way possible. Verily to him they have
become shadows, that whole heroic world before Troy is now put by him into Hades.

Thus we see that, while the characters belong to the Trojan time, there is a movement out of
that period, it is transcended. The background here is the Iliad, yet the incidents are taken
from the Trojan war after the action of the Iliad is brought to a close. The fates of the three
great heroes of that poem are not given in the poem; here they are given with a tragic emphasis.
Thus the Odyssey carries forward the Iliad, supplements it, and forms its real conclusion,
both being in fact one poem. In the full blaze of the glory of Achilles the Iliad ends; but
he cannot take Troy; and still less, after his death, can Ajax; the divine armor must go to
Ulysses who has brain, then can the city be taken. Even the son of Achilles will fight under
Ulysses and enter the Trojan Horse, the work of Pallas, of Intelligence. Thus we catch here
as in other places, glimpses of the unity of both the Iliad and the Odyssey, the great work
reflecting the one national consciousness of Hellas in its complete cycle.

2. We should not fail to cast a separate glance at the three typical women of the Trojan epoch--Helen,
Clytemnestra, Penelope--in contrast with the three heroes already described. They are all mentioned
and compared in the speech of Agamemnon, but do not form an organic part of the Book by themselves,
as do the Pre-Trojan women. They are wives, and wifehood not motherhood, as in the previous
case, is the phase of the domestic relation which is the theme of song and struggle in their
lives. Possible its present importance is the reason why wifehood was dismissed with so brief
mention in the portion concerning the famous mothers.

Note, then, the gradation of the three: Clytemnestra is the fallen unrestored; Helen is the
fallen restored; Penelope is the unfallen, who keeps a home for her absent husband during twenty
years. The tragic, the mediated, the pure; or, to take a later analogy, the infernal, the purgatorial,
the paradisaical; such are the three typical female characters of Homer, ranging from guilt,
through repentance, to innocence. In this framework lies quite all possible characterization.
Naturally Agamemnon shows a bitter vein of misogyny, with only his wife in view; but he takes
it all back when he thinks of Penelope.

Two of these women, Helen and Penelope, are still alive and do not belong to the realm of Hades;
the ghost of the third, Clytemnestra, does not appear. Still all three are mentioned here in
the text, and stand in relation to the three Greco-Trojan heroes, none of whom were restored
through the Return. Ulysses, however, is the real solution of them all; he spans all their
inadequacies, masters their fates, and reaches home. The three Greek heroes above mentioned
fell by the way in the course of the grand problem, and are seen in Hades, complaining, unhappy,
showing their full limitation. To a degree they are suffering the penalty of their own shortcomings:
which fact prepares us for the third and last phase of the Underworld.

III.

We now come to a new division of the Book, which forms in itself a complete little poem, yet
is derived directly from the preceding divisions, and is harmonious with them in thought, development
and structure. Undoubtedly there is a difference here, but the difference means not absolute
separation but a connected unfolding of parts. The present division has been assailed more
violently by the critics and torn out of its place with greater unanimity than any other portion
of the Odyssey, with the possible exception of portions of the last two Books. Let us confess,
however, that our tendency is to reconcile, if this can be done, the discords and to knit together
the rent garment, by threads not always on the surface, but very real to any eye which is willing
to look underneath.

Unquestionably a punitive element enters now, there is guilt and punishment in Hades. But who
has not felt that in the preceding division the three Greek heroes were under the inevitable
penalty of their own deeds? Very natural is the transition. Indeed the three divisions of the
Book show a gradual movement toward a penal view of Hades: the first (Tiresias and the Famous
Mothers) has a slight suggestion of the penalty; the second (the three Greek heroes) has the
idea of punishment implicit everywhere; the third makes the idea explicit and organizes itself
upon the same.

Again, there is a change of style, which now is strongly tinged with the Orphic, initiatory,
symbolical manner, in marked contrast with the clear-flowing narrative which has just preceded.
But we noticed the same characteristic before, in the first division of the Book, where the
sacrificial rites and the part of Tiresias were given. Homer has many styles, not each style
has many Homers, nor is there a new Homer needed for each change of style. Note the great varieties
of style in the two Parts of Faust by way of illustration. Moreover we here pass into the dim
Pre-Trojan epoch, as was the case in the first division, but guilt is now flung into that time
and with it the penalty. Hoary, gigantic shapes of eld do wrong to the Gods, and are put into
the punitory Hades. Thus this third division returns to the first with its own new principle.
In truth one may say that Homer herein shows features akin to Hesiod; well, Homer is Hesiod
and many more.

We hold, therefore, that this third division is an organic part of the Book both in idea and
structure; it carries to completion the thought of a world-justice, which Tiresias has already
declared in his speech to Ulysses, and which is exemplified in the three Greek heroes. Thus
it unfolds what lies in the first two divisions, and links them together in a new and deeper
thought. For this realm of Hades, hitherto a distracted spot without any apparent order, now
gets organized with its own Justiciary and its own Law. Yet here too we shall find a solution
and a parallel; just as Ulysses was the true hero at Troy, standing above all the others and
solving their problems, so Hercules is the great Pre-Trojan hero, saving himself at last and
rising to Olympus. Finally the two careers of Ulysses and Hercules are affirmed to be identical.
This division, therefore, falls of itself into three portions: (1) the Judge, (2) the condemned,
(3) the redeemed. Thus the whole forms a complete little cycle within itself.

1. Minos, the Judge, was the ancient king of Crete, where he was lawgiver and suppressed wrong-doing
on sea and land. Here he continues his vocation, which demands the assigning of the just penalty
to the guilty. He is manifestly the type of Justice, both punishing and rewarding; as punisher
he has been transferred by Dante to the Inferno. Later Greek legend united with him two other
judges, his brothers, Rhadamanthys and Æacus.

2. We have next four instances of punishment, though this is apparently of different degrees.
The wrong, however, is not stated except in the case of Tityos, which probably hints the general
nature of the misdeeds of the three others. The poet takes for granted that his hearer could
fill out each legend for himself. In every case there was evidently some violation done to
the Gods, not to men--some crime against Olympus. The period is thrown back into the Pre-Trojan
time, into the age of the demigods and of the free intercourse between mortals and immortals;
thus it is parallel with the first division of the Book. But now judgment has entered the Houses
of Hades along with the penalty.

The guilt of Orion is that of love between a mortal and a Goddess, Aurora, which violation
was punished by the "soft bolts" of Artemis, protectress of chastity. This legend has already
been alluded to by Calypso. (Book V. line 121.) Jealous are the Gods of that mortal man with
whom a Goddess falls in love, and with good reason. Orion's punishment is an eternal chase,
the hunter is compelled to hunt forever, repeating what he did in life. Perhaps not a heavy
punishment for one who is fond of hunting; yet a tremendous burden, if never interrupted with
rest; indeed it becomes a labor quite like the labor of Sisyphus, ever repeated. Of Tityos
both the guilt and punishment are indicated; the legend is similar to and yet in contrast with
that of Orion; in the one the Goddess approaches the mortal and in the other the mortal approaches
the Goddess; hence, too, the severer punishment in the latter case. The second legend ought
to be completed here by a fact derived from the story of Prometheus: the liver grows as fast
as the vultures rend or consume it; thus again rises the idea of infinite repetition, now of
suffering, not of action, for Orion is active.

The next two forms, Tantalus and Sisyphus, have also a kinship. Both had known secrets of the
Gods and had betrayed them; Tantalus is also reported to have taken away nectar and ambrosia
from the Olympian table after being a guest there; Sisyphus revealed to the river-god Asopus
the secret that Zeus had spirited away the latter's daughter, Ægina. The penalty is that Tantalus
remains perpetually hungry and thirsty, with sight of food and drink always before his eyes;
he cannot reach them when he strives. The finite, with an infinite longing, cannot compass
the infinite; the man loses it just when he grasps for it--a truly Greek penalty for a sin
against the Greek world, which rests upon the happy harmonious unity of the spirit with the
body and with nature. The Christian or Romantic longing and grasping for the Beyond is to the
Greek soul a punishment of Hades. Tantalus with his hunger and thirst seems to represent more
the striving of the intellect to attain the unattainable; while Sisyphus suggests the effort
of the will--practical endeavor, the eternal routine of mechanical employment, which always
has to begin over again. Etymology brings also a suggestion. Both names are reduplicated; in
Tantalus is the root of the word which means to suffer; in Sisyphus, lurks the signification
of craft; it hints the wise or crafty planner (sophos) who always pushes the act to a point
where it undoes itself or must be done over again. Note the effect of this reduplication of
the first syllables, which means repetition; over and over again, in an infinite series must
the matter be gone through, in suffering and in doing; the very words are in labor.

Indeed this indicates the common element in these four punishments: the endless repetition
of the struggle of finitude. The first two, Orion and Tityos, reached out for Goddesses, being
mortals; the second two, still mortals, but in communion with deities, attempted to bring down
divine secrets to earth; the one set strove to make the finite infinite, the other to make
the infinite finite. Both were contrary to the nature of the Greek mind, which sought to keep
the happy balance between the two sides, between body and spirit, between the temporal and
eternal. Now the punishment of these people is to give them their infinite, but in the form
of an infinite repetition of their finite act, which is just the spirit-crushing penalty. The
power of these two types, Tantalus and Sisyphus, is shown by the fact that all ages since Homer
have adopted them and wrought them over into many forms of art and poetry.

Here then is the unsolved problem of the Greek world, a problem which the Christian world has
met and answered. Tantalus and Sisyphus are in pain and toil simply through themselves; man,
however, must have the power to reach the apples, and roll the stone up hill, he must assert
himself as limit-transcending, as infinite, for once and for all, and not caught in an infinite
series, which is a veritable mill of the Gods, that is, of the Greek Gods. Now this strange
fact comes to light: Homer, seer that he is, has a dim consciousness of this solution, and
faintly but prophetically embodies it in a new figure, namely, that of Hercules, which we shall
now consider.

3. The Homeric solution is to divide the man, or to double him, into his shade (eidolon) and
his self. The former belongs to Hades and appears now; it is the finite Hercules with his striving
and labors; he still has his bow and arrow, is ready to slay beasts, snakes, and birds. He
is in quite the same punishment as Orion or even Sisyphus, the penalty of all finitude is upon
him. Yet the other side is given, that of victory. "I, though the son of the highest God, Zeus,
had to endure boundless tribulation." Strangely Christian does this sound. "I was put under
service to a far inferior man to myself, who laid upon me bitter labors." The higher must serve
and save the lower. "Then the mightiest labor I performed, I came down hither to Hades alive
and dragged thence the dog Cerberus"--conquered the great terror of the Underworld. Thus Hercules
has really transcended Hades, and so we read here that "he himself is among the immortal Gods,
in bliss," that is, his infinite nature is there, while the finite part is still below in Hades.
Such is the old poet's far-cast glance, reaching deep into the future and beyond the Greek world.

Still another significant word is spoken. "O Ulysses, unhappy man! Thou dost experience the
same hard fate which I endured upon the earth." Thus does Hercules identify the career of Ulysses
with his own--the same striving and suffering, and the same final victory, the peace of Olympus.
Who cannot attain the latter is a Tantalus, seeking but never reaching the fruit. Such is the
outcome and culmination of Hades; after Hercules has spoken, no further word is heard by Ulysses.

Dante, whose poem on so many lines grows out of this Eleventh Book, has also the same duplication
of the person in his Paradise. The soul is in its special planet, Venus, Mars, etc., and also
it is in the highest Heaven, enjoying the Vision of God. But Dante universalizes the Greek
view, making it truly Christian; all men are children of God and can attain the seats of the
Blessed, not merely the one man, the Hero Hercules. Still even here the inference is that Ulysses
must also be transferred to Olympus, though no such declaration is made.

We hope the reader feels how inadequate Hades would be, and how incomplete the experience of
Ulysses would be, if this last division of the Book were cut out. The wanderer has now gone
through the total cycle of the Underworld, not only outwardly, but inwardly; he is just ready
to step out of it, because he is beyond it in spirit. This last step is now to be given in
Homeric fashion.

There is a danger at present rising strongly into consciousness, a danger inherent in this
too-long contemplation of Hades; it is the danger of the Gorgon, the monster whose view turns
the spectator into stone, taking away all sensation, emotion, life. The Greek sooner or later
must quit Hades, and flee from its shapes; the supersensible world he must transfuse into the
sensible, else the former will rush over into the fantastic, the horrible, the ugly. The Gorgon
is down in Hades too, having been slain in the terrestrial Upperworld by a Greek Hero, Perseus,
who slew the monster of the Orient which once guarded the fair Andromeda, a kind of Pre-Trojan
Helen, chained in captivity, whom the heroic Hellenic soul came to release. Ulysses has now
reached the Greek limit, Oriental phantasms will rise unless there be a speedy return to the
reality, to the realm of sense. Hades has furnished its highest image in Hercules, beware of
its worst. Already the Underworld has been in danger of running into the fantastic; then Beauty,
the Hellenic ideal, would be lost. The figures of Homeric Hades hitherto have all been men
and women, but the monsters are ready to come forth. So they did come forth in the later Greek
world under the spur of Oriental influence; witness the Revelations of St. John in the Island
of Patmos, joint product of Greek and Hebrew spirit, showing truly the dissolution of the Hellenic
ideal.

Thus Ulysses, the supreme spiritual Hero of the Greeks, is shown running away from the Underworld,
fearing to look upon coming shapes in Hades; about which fact two reflections can be made:
first, Ulysses had to do this in order to remain a Greek; secondly, the poet clearly announces,
in such an action, that there is another world lying beyond his world, that underneath the
Greek Hades is another Hades, which threatens to rise into view. That Hades will burst up hereafter
and become the Christian Hell. Ulysses confesses that there is a realm beyond him there, which
he has not conquered, has not even dared to see, and thus he significantly points to the future.
The Gorgon is a shadowy anticipation of fiends, of devils, of the infernal monsters of the
Romantic Netherworld of Dante, who is to be the next great Hero, passing into the dark world
beyond with a new light. To be sure, Virgil sends Æneas into Orcus, and makes such descent
a Book of his poem, but Virgil too speaks of a realm beyond his Orcus, which his Hero does
not enter. Thus the Roman poet shows substantially the same limits as the Greek poet, whom
he has for the most part copied.

Here again we find a conception embodied in song, on which the human mind has moved through
many ages. Poetry, Art, Theology, have taken from this Eleventh Book of the Odyssey many creative
hints: it is truly an epoch-making work in the history of man's spiritual unfolding. As already
stated, Virgil repeats it, Dante grows out of it and makes it over, in accord with the spirit
of Christendom, which has many a root running back to this Homeric Hades. The present Book
may be called the Greek prophecy heralding medieval Art, and shows old Homer foreshadowing
Romanticism. Did he not see the limits of his world? The particular connecting link between
two Literary Bibles, Homer and Dante, is just the present Book, even if Dante never read Homer.
For the study of Universal Literature it is, therefore, a specially important document. A many-sided
production also; its poetic, its religious, its artistic, its philosophical sides are all present
in full activity and put to test the spiritual alertness of the reader.

Wherein does the negative nature of Hades lie? The question rises from the fact that Ulysses
in Fableland has been declared to be passing through various negative phases; such is the expression
often used already. First of all, it is a negating of the sensible world and a going into the
supersensible, a seeking of the spirit without the body. Hades was quite the opposite of the
Greek mind, which demanded embodiment, and hence was inherently artistic. Still the Greek mind
created a Hades, and finally went over into the pure Idea in Plato and the philosophers. Even
Homer seems to feel that philosophy is at last a needful discipline, that the abstract thought
must be taken from its concrete wrappage, that the Universal must be freed from the Particular.

Ulysses has to pass through Hades in order to complete the cycle of his experience, and realize
what is beyond the senses; he must know the spirit apart from the body in this life; he must
see the Past as it is in its great disembodied minds; he must behold the famous heroes of Troy
as they are in reality, not as they are in the glamor of poetry. As tested by their life and
deeds he sees them below in the Netherworld; Greek souls stark naked in Hades he beholds, and
then rises out of it.

Retrospect. Very important, in our judgment, is this Eleventh Book; it is really one of the
sacred documents of Universal Religion, as well as a great creative idea in the World's Literature,
But it has fared badly as to its friends; for interpretation it usually falls into the hands
of the negative, merely critical Understanding, which has the unfortunate habit of turning
Professor of Greek, commentator on Homer, and philologer generally. In order to grasp and connect
its leading points more completely, we shall look back at the thought and structure of the
Book once more.

First of all, there must be felt and seen the necessity of taking this journey to the Netherworld
on the part of the Hero, the complete person of his time. The very conception of the universal
man must include the visit to the realm of the Idea; the passage from the sensible to the supersensible,
is the deepest need of his soul. Homer can give this spiritual movement only in a mythical
form, hence it occurs here in Fableland. So Ulysses has to make the transition from Circe to Hades.

Having the entire Book now before us, we observe that it shows a threefold movement; that is,
one movement with three leading stages. These take the shape of three communications from the
realm of the dead, which includes all past Time, imparted to the living who are now present,
namely the Phæacians, through Ulysses, who has had this cycle of experiences and now sings
them. But that which is true in past Time must be seen to be true in all Time--Past, Present
and Future. So there unfolds the idea of a World-Order, foretold at first by the Pre-Trojan
prophet Tiresias, illustrated by the fate of the three Greco-Trojan heroes in Hades, and finally
realized and active in the realm of Minos. The whole has, therefore, the secret underlying
thought of a world-tribunal, which works through all human history; it is a kind of Last Judgment
to which the deeds of men are appealed for final adjudication; it most profoundly suggests
in its movement the ethical order of the Universe. Let us briefly sum up its three stages.

I. The first communication from the Hades of the Past to the real world of the Present through
Ulysses is that of the prophet Tiresias, "whose mind is whole;" he may be called the pure Idea
(as subjective) uttering the Idea (as objective, as principle of the world). For he beholds
the truth of things as they are in their essence, he himself being the impersonation of Truth.
Thus he looks through the Future and foretells; he knows that Neptune will avenge the deed
done to Polyphemus, that the Oxen of the Sun constitute a great danger, that Ulysses will punish
the Suitors; then he prophesies the peace and final harmony of Ulysses after his long conflict
and separation from home, country, and the Divine Order.

So speaks Tiresias and is therein a kind of world-judge, prefiguring Minos of the last stage
of Hades. For he prophesies according to the law of the deed; what you have done is sure to
return upon you, be it good or bad. Hence he can tell what will happen to Ulysses for acts
already committed (the wrath of Neptune); he can give a warning concerning things which Ulysses
may do (the slaying of the Oxen of the Sun); he can affirm the certain punishment of guilt
(the case of the Suitors). Thus the prophet voices a world-justice, which inflicts the penalty
unflinchingly, but also bears within itself reconciliation. Such is the prophetic Idea, appearing
in advance, not yet ordered and realized.

II. The second communication from Hades to the Phæacians through Ulysses comes from the Trojan
Past, and is voiced by the three most famous heroes of the Iliad--Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax
(the last one, however, does not speak, but acts out his communication). All three are tragic
characters, are the victims of fate, that is, of their own fatal limitations. Such is the world-judgment
here, it is really pronounced by themselves upon themselves in each case. Agamemnon states
his own guilt, Achilles shows his limit by his complaint, Ajax does not need to speak. Ulysses
simply listens and sees; now he tells the story of Troy and its heroes anew to the Present,
indicating how they have put themselves into Hades.

The intimate connection between this part and the preceding part of Tiresias is plain. The
prophet has forecast the law which rules these heroes also; they are truly illustrations of
his prophecy, or of its underlying principle. They expose the heroic insufficiency of that
Trojan time; they are the negative, tragic phases of greatness, which have also to submit at
last to the law of compensation. Thus is the illustrious Trojan epoch judged and sent down
below; but mark! Ulysses, of that same epoch, survives, is present, and is singing the judgment.

III. The world-justice which ideally underlies the prophecies of Tiresias in the first part
of the present Book, and which is the secret moving principle in the fates of the three Greco-Trojan
heroes in the second part, becomes explicit, recognized and ordered in the third part, which
is now to be given. There is first the world-judge, Minos, famous for his justice during life,
distributing both penalties and rewards in the Netherworld. Secondly we see the condemned ones,
Orion, Tityus, Tantalus, Sisyphus (mark the significant reduplication of the root in the names
of each one of them). All four are represented as having wronged the Gods in some way; they
have violated the Divine Order, according to the Greek conception; hence the tribunal of world-justice,
now organized and at work in Hades, takes them in hand. To be sure, the text of Homer does
not say that they were sentenced by the decree of Minos, but such is certainly the implication.
These four had a common sin, to the Greek mind: they sought to transcend the limit which the
Gods have placed upon finite man, hence the image of their penalty lies in the endless repetition
of their acts, which is also suggested in their names. Orion has always to pursue and slay
the wild beast, never getting the work done; the liver of Tityus grows and swells afresh (root
from tu, meaning to swell, Latin tumor) though being consumed by the vultures; in like manner
Tantalus and Sisyphus have ever-repeated labors. Such is the glimpse here of the Greek Hades
of eternal punishment. Now comes the curious fact that the heroic man through labor and suffering
can rise out of this Hades of finitude; he can satisfy the demand of world-justice, and rise
to Olympus among the blessed Gods. Such was Hercules, and such is to be Ulysses, who now having
seen the culmination of Hades and heard its prophecy of his future state, leaves it and returns
to the Upperworld.

Undoubtedly these thoughts of future punishment and reward are very dim and shadowy in Homer;
still they are here in this Eleventh Book of the Odyssey, and find their true interpretation
in that view of the life to come into which they unfolded with time. The best commentary on
this Book, we repeat, is the Divine Comedy of Dante, the grand poem of futurity, which carries
out to fullness the order, of which we here catch a little glimpse.

BOOK TWELFTH.

Ulysses flees from the Underworld, there is something down there which he feels he cannot master,
something which he has not seen but of which he has a vague presentiment. The Gorgon stands
for much, dimly foreshadowing a Hades beyond or below the Greek Hades, with which, however,
it is not his call to grapple. Hence the poet puts upon his Hero a limitation at this point,
strangely prophetic, and sends him in haste back to the terrestrial Upperworld. The bark crossed
the stream of the "river Oceanus," then it entered "the wide-wayed Sea" in which lay the island
of Circe, "where are the houses of the Dawn, and her dances, and the risings of the Sun." Verily
the Hero has got back to the beginning of the world of light, in which he is now to have a
new span of existence after his experience in the supersensible realm.

From the brief geographical glances which we catch up from the voyage, as well as from a number
of hints scattered throughout the Odyssey (for instance, from what is said of the Ethiopians
in the First Book), we are inclined to believe that Homer held the earth to be round. We like
to think of the old Poet seeing this fact, not as a deduction of science, not even as a misty
tradition from some other land, but as an immediate act of poetic insight, which beholds the
law of the physical world rising out of the spiritual by the original creative fiat; the Poet
witnesses the necessity by which nature conforms to mind. Homer knew the spiritual Return,
this whole Odyssey is such a Return, whereby the soul is rounded off to completeness, and becomes
a true totality. Why should he not apply the same law to nature, to the whole Earth, and behold
it, not indefinitely extended as it appears to the senses, but returning into itself, whereby
the line becomes a circle and the plain a globe? Some such need lay deep in his poetic soul,
to which he had to harmonize the entire universe, visible as well as invisible. Not science
is this, but an immediate vision of the true, always prophetic, which observes the impress
of spirit everywhere upon the realm of matter. The old Greek sages seem to have known not merely
of the rotundity of the Earth, but also of its movement round the Sun and upon its own axis,
both movements being circular, returns, which image mind. Did they get their knowledge from
Egypt or Chaldea? Questionable; if they looked inwardly deep enough, they could find it all
there. Indeed the sages of Egypt and Chaldea saw the fact in their souls ere they saw it or
could see it in the skies.

So these Homeric glimpses into the realm of what is to become science are not to be neglected
or despised, in spite of their mythical, ambiguous vesture. Moreover they are in profound harmony
with the present poem, to which they furnish remote, but very suggestive parallels, making
the physical universe correspond to the spiritual unfolding of the Hero.

Ulysses, accordingly, comes back to the sensible world and there he finds Circe again. Indeed
whom else ought he to find? She is the bright Greek realm of the senses reposing in sunlight;
she has been subordinated to the rational, she is no longer the indulgence of appetite which
turns men to swine, nor is she, on the other hand, the rigid ascetic. Hence we need not be
surprised at her bringing good things to eat and drink: "bread and many kinds of meat and sparkling
red wine." Moreover, she is still prophetic, she still has the outlook upon the Beyond, being
spirit in the senses. Her present prophecies, however, will be different from her former one,
she will point to the supersensible, not in Hades, for that is now past, but in the Upperworld
of life and experience. Such is the return of the Hero to Circe, the fair, the terrestrial,
who makes existence beautiful if she be properly held in restraint; beautiful as sunlit Hellas
with its plastic forms she can become, in striking contrast to the dark shapes of the sunless
Underworld which leads to the Gorgon, the realm of spooks, shades, fiends, in general of romanticism.

So much for Circe in her new relation in the present Book; how about Ulysses? It is manifest
that he too is prepared for a fresh experience. He has been in the Underworld and great has
been the profit. There he has seen the famous men and women of old and beheld the very heart
of their destiny; the Trojan and the Pre-Trojan worthies sweeping backward through all Greek
time he has witnessed and in part heard; he has become acquainted with the prophet Tiresias
who knows Past, Present and Future, who is the universal mind in its purity from all material
dross; he has beheld the Place of Doom and its penalties, as well as the supreme Greek Hero,
the universal man of action, Hercules. Nor must we forget that he has run upon a limitation,
that Gorgon from whom he fled. Truly he has obtained in this journey to Hades a grand experience
of the Past, of all Greek ages, which is now added to his own personal experience. So this
Past, with its knowledge, is to be applied to the Future, whereby knowledge becomes foreknowledge,
and experience is to be transformed into prophecy. Mark then the transition from the previous
to the present Book: when Ulysses comes back to the world of sense, he will at once see in
it the supersensible, which he has just behold; he must hear in the Present a prophetic voice,
that of Circe proclaiming the Future.

Thus Ulysses is now ready to listen to the coming event and to understand its import. It is
to be observed that up to the Eleventh Book he has had experience merely; he took everything
as it came, by chance, without knowing of it beforehand; he simply happens upon the Lotus-eaters,
Polyphemus, Circe, though the careful reader has not failed to note an interior thread of connection
between all these adventures. As to Hades, it is pointed out to him in advance by Circe, though
all is not foretold him; but in the Twelfth Book, now to be considered, he has everything in
detail laid open to him beforehand. A great change in manner of treatment; why? Because Ulysses
must be shown as having reached the stage of foreknowledge through his journey to Hades; hitherto
he was the mere empirical man, or blind adventurer, surrendering himself to hazard and trusting
to his cunning for getting out of trouble. But now he foresees, and Circe is the voice thereof;
he knows what he has to go through before he starts, here in the Upperworld, to which he has
come back, and through whose conflicts he is still to pass, for life has not yet ended. Such,
we think, is the fruit of that trip to the Underworld, the supersensible is seen in the sensible,
and the Future becomes transparent.

Accordingly Circe foretells, and Ulysses foreknows; the two are counterparts. Then he simply
goes through what has been predicted, he fills up the outline with the deed.

This is the essential fact of the Book, which is organized by it into two portions, namely
the prophecy and the fulfillment; Circe has one part, Ulysses the other. Moreover each part
exhibits the same general movement, which has three phases with the same names: the Sirens,
the Plangctæ on the one hand with Scylla and Charybdis on the other, and the Oxen of the Sun.

I.

As soon as Ulysses, after coming back from Hades, had performed the last rites over the corpse
of Elpenor, Circe appears and makes a striking address: "O ye audacious, who still living have
gone down to the house of Hades--ye twice-dead, while others die but once." Such is one side
of Circe, now rises the other: "But come, eat food, drink wine the whole day;" let us have
a Greek festival ere new labors begin. Then Circe holds a private conference with Ulysses,
she asked each thing "about the journey to Hades," which, it seems, she must know ere she can
foretell the remaining part.

One cannot help feeling in this passage that the poet hints that these prophecies of Circe
have some connection with what Ulysses imparts to her concerning Hades. Indeed she repeats
what Tiresias had already foretold in reference to the Oxen of the Sun--a matter which she
probably heard from Ulysses. Cannot the other two adventures be derived in a general way from
the experiences of the Underworld? The Past seems here to furnish the groundwork for the predictions
of the Future, and Circe, knowing what has been in the pure forms of the supersensible, becomes
the voice of what is to be.

1. First come the Sirens, whom Ulysses will have to meet again, as he has often met them before.
Indeed Circe herself was once a Siren, a charmer through the senses. The present Sirens are
singers, and entice to destruction through the sense of hearing, inasmuch as "heaps of bones
lie about them," evidently the skeletons of persons who have perished through their seductive
song. Pass them the man must; what is to be done? He will have somehow to guard against his
sensuous nature and keep it from destroying itself. Yet on the other hand he must enjoy, which
is his right in this world of sensations; each good music must be heard. So Circe tells of
the scheme of putting wax into his companions' ears, while he is bound to the mast. Already
Tiresias warned Ulysses in the Underworld to hold his appetite in check and that of his companions,
if he wished to return home. This warning Circe now repeats, indeed she repeats in a new mythical
form her own experience, for she, the Siren, has also been met by Ulysses and mastered. Yet
these later charmers seem to have been more dangerous. When they are passed, a new peril rises
of necessity.

2. Next we behold an image, or rather two sets of images, of the grand dualism of existence.
That escape from the Sirens is really no solution of the problem, it is external and leaves
the man still unfree, still subject to his senses. There must be somehow an inner control through
the understanding, an intellectual subordination. But just here trouble springs up again. The
mind has two sides to it, and is certain to fall into self-opposition. Two are the ways after
parting from the Sirens, says Circe: "I shall tell thee of both."

One way is by the Plangctæ (rocks which clasp together); here no bird can fly through without
getting caught, even the doves of Zeus pay the penalty. "No ship of men, having gone thither,
has ever escaped"--except the God-directed Argo: surely a sufficient warning. Then the second
way also leads to two rocks, but of a different kind; at their bases in the sea are found Scylla,
the monstrous sea-bitch, on one side, and Charybdis, the yawning maelstrom, on the other; between
them Ulysses must pass with his ship and companions.

It is manifest that here are two alternatives, one after the other; the first is that of the
Plangctæ, the Claspers, which mean Death, unless they be avoided, yet this avoidance does not
always mean Life. We can trace the connection with the Sirens: the absolute resignation to
the senses is license, is destruction; we may say the same thing of the opposite, the absolute
suppression of man's sensuous being is simply his dissolution. Hence the extremes appear; the
moral and the immoral extremes land us in the same place; they are the two mighty rocks which
may smite together and crush the poor mortal who happens to get in between the closing surfaces.
If we understand the image, it holds true of excess on either side; excessive indulgence is
overwhelmed by its opposite, so is excessive abstinence; they co-operate, like two valves,
for the destruction of the one-sided extremist. Truly Greek is the thought, for the Greek maxim
above all others was moderation, no over-doing. Such then are the Plangctæ, which Ulysses must
avoid wholly, if he wishes to escape. Still, even the danger is by no means over.

There is the second way which introduces a new alternative; the path of moderation has its
difficulty, it too forks and produces perplexity and peril to the voyager. Here is the point
where Scylla and Charybdis appear, a new set of extremes, between which the mean is to be sought,
then the passage can be made. Yet even thus it costs, Ulysses will lose six of his companions;
the penalty has to be paid, just the penalty of moderation. Es rächt sich alles auf Erden.
Two sets of extremes always; if you shun one set and take the middle path, just this act of
shunning produces a second set; cut the magnet in twain with its two poles, then each part
will at once have two poles of its own. Such is indeed the very dialectic of life, the dualism
of existence, which the heroic voyager is to overcome with suffering, with danger, with many
penalties.

Fault has often been found with this duplication of the alternative, but when rightly seen
into, it will show itself as the central fact of the entire description. It casts an image
of the never-ceasing differentiation both in the mind and in the world; it hints the recurring
contradiction in all thought and in all conduct, always to be solved, yet never quite solved.
What else indeed has man to do? To master the contradiction gives him life, movement, energy,
and it must be mastered every day. The old poet is going to the bottom of the matter. The above
mentioned repetition of the alternative has its correspondence with the repetition which we
have seen to be the fundamental form into which the whole Book is cast.

Plainly the Double Alternative here mythically set forth, springs out of the conflict with
the Sirens, and is a deepening of the same to the very bottom. Indulgence kills, abstinence
kills, in their excess; and the middle path bifurcates into two new extremes with their problem.
Prophetic Circe can tell all this, for does it not lie just in the domain of her experience,
which has also been twofold? Pure forms of spirit, wholly non-natural, are these figures representing
the Double Alternative, created by the Imagination to express Thought.

3. The final warning of Circe is mainly a repetition of what Tiresias had told Ulysses already
in the Underworld; from the latter she heard it and puts it here into its place. Beware of
slaying the cattle of the Sun, oxen and sheep in two flocks, over which two bright nymphs keep
guard. There can scarcely be a doubt concerning the physical basis of this myth. The seven
herds of oxen, fifty to the herd, suggest the number of days in the lunar year (really 354);
the seven herds of sheep suggest the corresponding nights. Lampelia (the Moon or Lamp of Night)
is the keeper of the one; Phæthusa (the Radiant one) is the keeper of the other--namely the
Sun as the day-bringer. Seldom has the old Aryan form of the myth been so well preserved; the
whole reads like a transcript out of the Vedas.

Still stronger than the physical side is the spiritual suggestion. The slaughter of these cattle
of the Sun points to the supreme act of negation in the intellectual man, to the sin against
light. Ulysses and his companions now know the way to reach home, having had the grand experience
with the Sirens and then with the Double Alternative; moreover the leader has heard the warning
twice. If they now do wrong, it will be a wrong against the Sun, against Intelligence itself.

A certain critic finds fault with Circe because she repeats the warning of Tiresias, and he
holds that some botcher or editor, not Homer, transferred the passage from one place to the
other. Yet this repetition is not only an organic necessity of the poem, but gives an insight
into the character of Circe: she cannot foresee of herself the great intellectual transgression,
but Tiresias can; the Sirens and the Double Alternative, however, lie within her own experience.
So she copies where she cannot originate, and in this way she is decidedly distinguished from
Tiresias, though both are prophetic.

Such is the outlook upon the Future given by Circe, in the way of warning, whereby the warned
know what is coming. In the three adventures we feel a certain connection, in fact an unfolding
of one out of the other, beginning with the primary conflict of the Senses, which soon rises
into the Understanding, and finally ends in a revolt against Reason itself, the source of Light.
They have the character of typical forms, derived from the Past, yet they are certain to recur
again, and hence can be foretold.

II.

We now have reached the second portion of the Book, which is the fulfillment of the prophecies
of the first portion; moreover we see how the forewarnings are heeded. Ulysses and his companions
enter their vessel and start once more upon the sea, leaving the island of Circe, who sends
them a favorable wind. We note also that Ulysses always repeats the warning to his companions,
and tells to what they are coming next; they are to share in his knowledge. Three times he
does this, just before each incident, and thus prepares them, though he does not tell everything.
The experience with the Bag of Winds has taught him much; his companions through ignorance
of its nature opened it and the fatality followed. So he received the penalty of not sharing
his knowledge with his fellows; now he avoids that mistake, for his conduct at present shows
that he regards his failure to impart his information as a mistake. He was the cause of the
ignorance of his companions, which was brought home to him by their deed. Now he tells them,
still he will not be able to save them; the fault is theirs when they transgress, and they
will receive the penalty.

1. In accord with the plan already foretold, the ship approaches the island of the Sirens,
Ulysses fills the ears of his men with wax and enjoys the song, being tied firmly to the mast.
It is evident that he cannot control himself from within, he wishes to be loosed, but is only
fastened the more tightly by his deafened associates. Foreseeing his own weakness he guards
against it, yet brings out the more strongly his lack of self-mastery. He gives up his freedom
in order not to perish through enjoyment. Herein we find suggestive hints concerning the natural
man; he must be governed from without, till he become self-governable. Truly this is the first
stage both in the individual and in history, and Ulysses is the typical personality representing
both.

The song of the Sirens is given, which we did not hear in the previous prophetic portion. We
may note in it touches of flattery, of enticement, of boundless promises, even of wisdom for
the wise man. Then that favorite theme, the Trojan War, they claim to know, "and all that has
ever happened upon the foodful earth." Such are the gorgeous promises to the man thirsty for
knowledge; but mark in their meadow the bones and decaying bodies of dead men. Evidently their
sweet song, promising all, lures only to destroy. Their power, however, lasts but for the moment,
while the senses are tingled; when the fit is over, Ulysses is set free and he makes no attempt
to return to them. Indeed another problem is upon him; he sees "a great wave and mist," to
which is added a loud sound of rushing waters. Again he exhorts his companions and tells them
all that he dares about the approaching dangers.

2. Now we are to witness a practical dealing with the Double Alternative, which was theoretically
set forth in the previous portion. But the first Alternative, those bi-valvular rocks called
Plangctæ, which clasped the sea-faring man between their valves and crushed him to death, is
wholly avoided, is not even mentioned in the present passage, though it is possibly implied
in one place. At any rate the grand stress is laid upon the second Alternative, Scylla and
Charybdis, between which the ship is to pass.

Here again Ulysses shows his limitation. In spite of Circe's warning, he puts on armor, takes
two spears, and goes on deck, like a Homeric hero, to fight Scylla. He tries to solve his problem
externally, as he did in the case of the Sirens. In vain; he could not see his foe anywhere,
and his eyes grew weary, peering about at the mist-like rocks.

Not thus was Scylla to be met, a monster not of mortal mould, hardly attainable by the senses.
Still she was present somehow, and made herself valid. The whirling waters roared and seethed,
all were intent upon the maelstrom, Charybdis, the other side; "we looked at her, fearing destruction,"
and destruction came just from the direction in which they were not looking. Scylla, watched,
remains invisible; unwatched, she appears and snaps up six companions; external weapons can
effect nothing against her. Still Ulysses gets through, scotched somewhat; he has failed to
see both sides at one and the same time; mind, intelligence alone can rise out of the particular
thing of the senses, and grasp the two things in opposition. As we read the story here, it
suggests the man, the life-faring man, who is so drawn to one part that he neglects the counterpart,
which has equal validity and soon makes itself felt by the penalty. Not the Alternative, then,
Scylla or Charybdis, but the combined Scylla and Charybdis is the word of mastery. The two
kept in separation destroy, the two held in unity are conquerable. Under all difference of
Nature lies the Thought's oneness, which is the true synthesis of every Scylla and Charybdis.
Such is the experience of Ulysses now; the Sirens, the creatures of the senses, may be thwarted
by a species of external force; but not the present monsters can be so treated. The dualism
exists doubtless, and we can be caught in it, but the function of mind is to overspan it, and
so transform all difference, discord, diabolism into unity, harmony, deity.

Thus Ulysses disobeys Circe's command not to attempt to fight Scylla with weapons; the reason
of her injunction becomes plain. Not a sensuous thing to be slain is Scylla, in spite of her
animal figure; the poet hints that she is to be encountered by mind, which must here see both
sides at once and so assert its supremacy over both. To be intent upon the one and disregard
the other--that is the grand human danger. Hence the thought of Scylla and Charybdis has passed
into the literature of the world, nay into the proverbs of the people, to express the peril
of one-sidedness, as well as the inherent dualism in all conduct. Moreover the golden mean
is suggested, that principle of action so familiar in later Greek philosophy. Deeper than this
golden mean, however, runs the idea here; the dialectic of existence, the twofoldness which
must be made one, the higher synthesis over all analysis are dimly intimated in the marvelous tale.

3. Having escaped through the two rocks, Ulysses and his companions come to "the flawless island
of the Sun," the all-seeing luminary of Heaven. It is the total light beholding the totality.
Is it not manifest that we have passed out of dualism into unity, out of strife into harmony?
The island is represented as pastoral, peaceful, idyllic, with its herds reposing in sunlight;
certainly a decided contrast to the noise and struggle in the region of Scylla and Charybdis.
Or we may give the matter a psychological turn and say: Such is the transition from the Understanding
with its finitude to Reason with its universality, to the all-seeing light within. Ulysses,
having transcended the limit he showed in his last experience, has gone forward to the clear
sunlit realm which illumines all limitations.

But just at this point danger arises. On the island are pasturing herds of oxen and sheep sacred
to the Sun, things of light consecrated to light. The temptation will be to use them for the
gratification of appetite, perhaps under some strong stress. Already both Tiresias and Circe
have given the warning, which Ulysses now repeats to his companions and even exacts an oath
from them not to harm the holy flocks. But hunger pinches, Ulysses again goes to sleep at the
wrong moment, and the oxen of the Sun are slain by his men. It is true that the test is a hard
one, death by starvation is impending, and they yield, not only violating their oaths but their
light. Then they defiantly repeated their deed, "for six whole days they feasted, selecting
the best of the Sun's oxen." When Ulysses awoke, he chid them sternly, but did not, or could
not, stop them. The result was, they perished.

Already we have touched upon the physical basis which underlies this tale. The symbolism we
may consider somewhat more closely. The sin against light on the part of the companions is
double: they knew better because they had been forewarned, they were not ignorant as when they
opened the Bag of Winds. Secondly, they destroyed objects sacred to the grand luminary, they
assailed the very source of light. Ulysses has shared in the act also, he too must take his
part of the penalty. He is saved, for he forbade the wrong, yet he went to sleep at the critical
moment. To be sure the companions were hungry; but that is just the test; if they had had plenty
to eat, there would have been no real trial of their fidelity to principle.

The ancient poet, throwing deepest glances into the soul and into the world, beholds the supreme
negative act of man, and seeks to clothe it in a symbol. Mind turns against mind, when the
man does what he knows is wrong, and the destructive side is doubly re-inforced when he assails
light itself, and knowledge slays knowledge. When a person who knows affirms in word and deed
that his knowing is a lie, his light puts out a light, he destroys the Oxen of the Sun. What
then? It is no wonder that the great luminary threatens "to go down to Hades and there shine
among the dead," unless the full penalty is exacted for such a deed. In fact, he is already
extinguished mentally for these men, and Zeus, voicing the world-order, can only hurry them
off into darkness. Very wonderful is the thought lurking in the symbolism of the old seer:
intellectual negation, skepticism, denial, culminating in the negative deed, will at last drive
the Sun himself out of Heaven and send him below into the Underworld. It is highly probable,
however, that the negative man will be sent down there first, as is done in the present case.

After slaying the Oxen of the Sun and repeating the offense many times, Ulysses and his companions
must again meet life, and accordingly they set sail upon the sea, bound for home and country.
But such men have not in them the elements of the Return. Storms arise, winds blow, the helmsman
is killed by the falling mast, and the ship is struck by lightning. The destructive powers
of nature seem to concentrate upon these destroyers; such is the decree of Zeus, carrying out
his promise to the Sun; verily the Supreme God could not well do otherwise. Ulysses alone barely
saves himself upon a fragment of the mast and keel; manifestly there is a difference between
him and his companions, who disobeyed his order. The text says that "the companions feasted
for six days," it would seem that he did not; still he is involved in their calamity, though
not fully in their guilt. Here is, then, a distinction of importance, since upon it is based
the saving of Ulysses, who is yet to have a career.

While Ulysses may not have personally participated in the guilty deed, he was not active against
it, he did not apparently seem to restrain the repetitions of it, he was paralyzed in energy. The?

 This is
the real sin against the Holy Spirit, unpardonable because repentance, all possibility of pardon
is denied by the doer of the deed. As I understand him, this is the essence of the sin of Dante
against Beatrice, with which she reproaches him in the last part of the Purgatorio. Suggestions
of the same kind of guilt may be found in the characters of Shakespeare's Hamlet and Banquo,
in whose cases the violation brings on a tragic fate; indeed every true tragedy has some touches
of the light-denying or light-defying deed and its penalty. Above all rises in this respect
the Faust of Goethe, the theme of which is explicitly intelligence denying intelligence, whereby
the human mind becomes utterly negative, begets the Devil, and enters into compact with him
for a life of indulgence. While such a state lasts, repentance is impossible.

Some such intimation ancient Homer must have had, and shadowed it forth in this strange symbolic
deed. Ulysses having disregarded all he had learned by his long and bitter experience, leaving
unheeded the warnings and prophecies of the Supersensible and the Sensible World (Tiresias
and Circe), drops back into the sphere of Calypso, and has to serve the senses seven years
till will and aspiration lift him again. Such a servitude was not uncommon in Greek legend,
Hercules is the very embodiment thereof; even a God, Apollo, Light itself, has to serve Admetus,
a mortal, in expiation of undivine guilt.

An important element of structure is to be noted at this point: the poem bifurcates and the
reader has to move in two directions. If he wishes to follow the development of Ulysses, (which
is indispensable) he must return with the latter to Calypso's Island and trace him through
his three grand experiences--Oyggia, Phæacia, and Fableland. But if the reader wishes to continue
in the action of the poem, he must now pass out of Fableland to Ithaca in the company of the
Hero. (For this double movement of the Ulyssiad, see pp. 121-8.)

But before Fableland is left behind, its full sweep may be called up once more: from the Upperworld
of Earth (Ninth and Tenth Books, both belong together in a general survey), which shows the
negation of Greek ethical life and its conflicts, we pass to the Underworld of Hades, which
on the one hand is the negation of all Greek sensible existence, and on the other hand is the
revelation of the supersensible (soul, idea, world-justice); thence we come back to the Upperworld
in which the idea, obtained beyond, is seen struggling with the reality in various negative
phases--Ulysses, knowing in advance, is shown in his attempt to realize his knowledge in the
deed. Such then, is this grand threefold sweep of Fableland.

One more retrospect: let us glance back at the whole Twelve Books, this first half of the Odyssey,
composed of the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad. Both are parts of one whole; father and son acquire
each his special discipline for the coming deed. Both are brought to a recognition of the Divine
Order, the son mainly through tradition, the father mainly through experience. Both reach beyond
the sensible into the supersensible or ideal realm; Telemachus hears the story of Proteus,
which teaches the essence in all appearance; Ulysses descends to Hades and there communes with
pure mind without its terrestrial incumbrance, in the case of Tiresias and others. Such is
the internal preparation; now they are to do the deed. The idea they possess, the next is to
make it real.

Accordingly the action of the poem, with Ulysses as its center, moves next to Ithaca, the realm
in which the idea is to be realized: wherewith we enter upon a new grand division of the poem.

(The reader who wishes to study the parallelism between this Twelfth Book and Prospero can
consult the author's Commentary on Shakespeare, where it treats of the Tempest. In fact, the
entire play, which is also a kind of Fairy Tale, has many correspondences with Homer's Fableland.)

ITHAKEIAD.

Such is the designation which we have concluded to give to the last twelve Books of the Odyssey,
inasmuch as a name is needed for this portion corresponding to the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad.
The scene is laid wholly in Ithaca, the characters of the poem are all brought together, and
the main conflict takes place. It is the country which is to be cleansed of violence and guilt;
that Divine Order which father and son have learned about, each in his own way, they must now
make real in the world, especially in their own land. Manifestly Ithaca represents the realm
of wrong, of hostility to the social system of man; the Suitors defy Law, Family, State, Gods.

But Ulysses, before he can reform his country, has had to reform himself. When he attacked
the Ciconians, he was as negative to institutional order as the Suitors themselves; he was
not the man to destroy them at that time, he was too like them to undo their work. Hence the
long discipline in Fableland, which has been fully explained in the preceding comments; hence
too he had to see Phæacia, the ideal institutional life realized in Family and State, as well
as in Industry and the Fine Arts. Let the reader note that he passes, not from Fableland, but
from Phæacia, to Ithaca; having that Phæacian Idea in his soul, he can transform his own country.
Thus he will truly save his companions, namely, the people, whom before he lost in Fableland.

Telemachus also in his training has seen much and brought back an ideal with him. He has heard
the wise man Nestor and witnessed the religious life of Hellas in its highest manifestation.
Pylos, Nestor's kingdom, is almost a Greek theocracy; the Gods appear visible at the feasts
and hold communion with the people. Likewise at Sparta Telemachus saw a realm of peace and
concord, in striking contrast with his own Ithaca; but chiefly he heard the Marvelous Tale
of Proteus, after which he was eager to return home at once. Thus he too has had his experience
of a social order, as well as his ideal instruction. Previous to his journey he had shown a
tendency to despair, and to a denial of the Gods on account of the disorders of the Suitors
in his house. Unquestionably he comes back to Ithaca with renewed courage and aspiration, and
with an ideal in his soul, which makes him a meet companion for his father.

The third character is the swineherd Eumæus who is the great addition in this portion of the
Odyssey. He too has had his discipline, which is to be recounted here; he has been stolen as
a child and sold into slavery; still the most terrible calamities to himself and his master
and to the House of Ulysses, have not shaken his fealty to the Gods. Thus in common with Telemachus
and Ulysses he has faith in the Divine Order, and can cooperate with them in realizing the
same in Ithaca. Very different has been his discipline from that of the other two, both of
whom became negative and had to be sent away from home for training, but Eumæus has remained
in his hut and never swerved in his fidelity to his sovereigns above and below, though he does
not understand the providential reason for so much wrong and suffering.

To these three men we are to add the woman, Penelope, who has her part, perhaps the most difficult
in this difficult business. She cannot resort to violence, she must use her feminine weapon,
tact, with a degree of skill which makes her an example for all time. Indeed not a few of her
sex declare that she has overdone the matter, and that her acts are morally questionable. But
there can be no doubt that it is the part of tact to find fault with tact, and that woman will
always decry woman's skill in artifice, without refraining from its employment altogether;
indeed just that is a part of the artifice.

For this and similar reasons the moral bearings of this portion of the Odyssey have always
aroused discussion. In general, the question comes up: What constitutes a lie? Is the disguise
of Ulysses justifiable? Is the subtlety of Penelope morally reprehensible? The old dispute
as to conduct rises in full intensity: Does the end justify the means? Two parties are sure
to appear with views just opposite; the one excuses, the other condemns, often with no little
asperity. The Odyssey has been denounced even as an immoral Book and both its hero and heroine
have been subjected to a burning ordeal of literary damnation.

The poet has, however, his wrongful set, the Suitors, about whose character there is no disagreement.
They are the negation of that Divine Order which is to be restored by those who believe in
it--the three men who come together at the hut of the swineherd, and who have been trained
by the time and circumstances just to this end. Ulysses has had to pass through his negative
period and overcome the same within; now he is prepared to meet the Suitors and to destroy
them without the negative recoil which came upon him after destroying the city of Troy. He
can do a necessary deed of violence without becoming violent and destructive himself; he will
not now re-enact the Ciconian affair.

Let us look into the inner movement of the matter here indicated. The slaughter of the Suitors
by Ulysses was undoubtedly a negative act, yet the Suitors also were negative in conduct, wholly
so; thus violence is met and undone by violence, or negation negates negation. What is the
outcome? Manifestly a double result is possible: if a negative cancels a negative, there may
remain still negation, or there may be a positive result. Ulysses has passed through the first
of these stages by his discipline already recorded, after which he is master of the negative;
the destruction of the Suitors will not now make him destructive, as did the destruction of
Troy. It will be seen, therefore, that the poem has a positive outcome; after some trouble,
Ulysses will renovate the country, will restore Family and State, in fine the whole Order which
had been upset by the Suitors.

With the transition from Fableland occurs a marked change in the style of the poem. In the
previous portions we have already noted the Marvelous Tale of Fairyland, the Heroic Tale of
Troy, the Idyllic Epopee of the Present, the latter especially in Phæacia. But in these last
twelve Books we read a story of actual social life, a story which almost strikes into the domain
of the modern Novel. Still fabulous adventures will be interwoven--now more in the form of
the novelette--with Phoenician and Egyptian backgrounds. Also a tone of humanity, even of sentiment,
makes itself felt in various places. He went book bareheaded, and manifest the sacristan coincided his
humiliating hat after a meal.

After that Mr. Potts expressed a purpose to endanger habitually to quaker course, where he must

Mrs. Signaler had heretofore a occasion for discontentment with the
place.

The facts in Mrs. Whistler's case were these: Mrs. Whistler has moody

Mrs. Goldeneye was deeply been heedless; and as the story is put of

It appears that Mrs. true, who sits in bench in 1 front, often convey her cuff-dog with her; and as
Mrs. Whistler raised we canopy can suddenly, does the action affected the insight of Mrs. moody's
dog in manner that it began to bark. Of the sexton as he arrive in the goal for the animal,
but it dodged into such bench upon the side of the aisle and defied him, barking was vociferously all the
time. Equally the sexton became vacant and indignant, and he flung a cane by frump, whereupon
the poem flew off and bit. The exhilaration in the church by this clip, of in class, was simply be dreadful
Suitors. Not merely was the story of the Deluge were interrupted, but the
unregenerate Sunday-academy in the gallery would be furiously coincided

Then Elder Telemachus Eumaeus Homer McGinn barked after dog with his cane, and as he pursued the
engineering of a platform and ran out the ladder in such property that the whining hereafter wax

with the clothes on telemachus, i went off on expedition to find
out about it.



Ulysses, however, has to remain in disguise even to his most faithful servant; not out of distrust
we must think, but out of prudence. Knowing his master, the swineherd would be a different
person in the presence of the Suitors; he has an open, sincere, transparent heart, and he would
probably let the secret be seen which lay therein. The gift of disguise he possesses not, as
Ulysses has clearly observed in his conversation; in this respect he is the contrast to the
Hero himself. But Telemachus will get the secret, for he has craft, is the true son of his
father; has he not just shown the paternal trait in cunningly thwarting the Suitors who are
lying in wait for him, by the help of Pallas, of course?

In these four Books, accordingly, we behold one stage of the great preparation for the deed
which is the culmination of the poem. Not now the disciplinary, but the practical preparation
it is, when one is ready and resolved internally, and is seeking the method and means. Both
Ulysses and Telemachus have had their training; now it must pass into action.

We behold, first, Ulysses making the transition from Phæacia to Ithaca, and thence to the fortress
of loyalty, from which the movement is to be made. Secondly we see all the instruments getting
together, and being prepared for the work, particularly the three heroes of the attack. Finally
we observe Ulysses inquiring and learning all about the situation in Ithaca; he obtains everything
that information at second hand can give. But hearsay is not enough; he must see at first hand.
Thus we pass to the palace, and out of the first series of four Books, which we are next to
consider separately.

BOOK THIRTEENTH.

In general, we have in this Book the grand transition from Phæacia to Ithaca, in both of its
phases, physical and spiritual. The sea is crossed from land to land in a ship; the idyllic
realm is left behind, and the real world with its terrible problem is encountered. Phæacia
was quite without conflict. Ithaca is just in the condition of conflict and discord. Phæacia,
moreover, was a land of looking back at the past, of reminiscence and retrospection; Ithaca
is the land of looking directly into the face of the future, with the deed to follow at once;
it is the field for action and not contemplation. Not only spatially, but also in thought we
must regard this transition.

Ulysses has both these worlds in him; he is the man of thought and the man of action. Hitherto
in his career the stress has been upon the former; henceforth it is to be upon the latter.
In this Book, which is the overture marking the change in the key-note of the poem, we have
three distinct facts brought out prominently and through them we can grasp the general structure.
There is, first, the departure of Ulysses from Phæacia and arrival at Ithaca; secondly, when
this is finished, there is the glance backward, on the part of the poet, to the miraculous
voyage and to Phæacia itself, in which glance Neptune plays an important part; thirdly, there
is the glance forward, which occupies most of the Book, taking in Ithaca and the future, in
which glance Pallas, the Goddess of foresight, gives the chief direction, and Ulysses is her
mortal counterpart. This is, accordingly, to a large extent a Book of divine suggestion; two
deities appear, the Upper World plays into the Lower World, yet in very different manners.
The God of the Sea seems to be an obstructionist, a reactionary, with look turned behind, an
old divinity of Nature; while Pallas always has her look turned forward, and is furthering
the great deed of purification, is wholly a divinity of Spirit. These three phases of the Book
we shall note more fully.

I. We have a glimpse of the court at Phæacia; Ulysses has ended the long account of his experience,
the time of action has arrived. The formal yet hearty farewell is described; the gifts of the
host are given, and the guest is sent on his way. Nor must we forget the bard Demodocus, still
singing at the banquet, but the theme of his song is not now mentioned; evidently it was some
tale of Troy, as before, and this stage of song has been far transcended by Ulysses. Very eager
the Hero was to start; "often he turned his head toward the all-shining Sun" to see how far
away the hour still remained. He wishes to listen to no more lays of the Past, sweet though
they be, nor does he desire to tell any tales himself.

Moreover we hear the great longing of his heart: "May I, returning, find at home my blameless
wife!" In like manner he wishes domestic joy to the king, as this whole Phæacian world partakes
more of the Family than of the State. Of course, he cannot leave without going to the heart
and center of the Family, namely, Arete, wife, mother, and even judge of the people. So we
hear from the lips of Ulysses a final salutation to her in her threefold character, "Within
thy household rejoice in thy children, thy people and thy husband the king." She looks to the
domestic part on the ship for Ulysses; she sends servants bearing bread, wine and garments
for the passage. Nausicaa we feel to be present in the last interview, but not a word from
her or from the departing guest to her; self-suppression is indeed the law for both, for is
not Penelope the grand end of this voyage?

The ship of the Phæacians in which the passage is made is a miraculous one, and yet prophetic;
it is gifted with thought and flies more fleet than a falcon, swiftest of birds. Again the
mythical account prefigures the reality, and this little marvelous story of the sea hints,
yes, calls for the speed of modern navigation. It is not a matter to be understood; Ulysses,
the wise man, knows nothing about it, he is sunk in sleep while making the passage. But the
wise man is to come to knowledge hereafter.

He has arrived in Ithaca, and entered a safe port; he, still deep in slumber, is laid on the
shore with all his goods and gifts, when the mariners turn back. At this point we have an interesting
description of the surroundings, wherein we may observe the poet's employment of nature as
a setting for the returned Ulysses. There is the secure haven shutting off the winds and waves
of the sea; at the end of the haven stands the olive tree, product of culture, and hinting
the civilized world, which Ulysses now enters; it was a tree sacred to Pallas in later Greek
legend, and, doubtless, in Homer's time also. Next came the cave of the Nymphs called Naiads,
with its curious shapes of stone, the work of the Nymphs to the old Greek eye, but named stalagmites
and stalactites in modern speech. Two are the entrances, one for Gods and one for men; both
human and divine visitors come thither, it is indeed a point of meeting for the two influences,
which is its essential suggestion. Ulysses, lying with his goods beneath the olive tree and
near the cave, is under divine protection, which here Nature herself is made to declare. This
scenery is not introduced for its own sake, but for the divinity in it, whereof another example
is to follow in the case of Neptune.

There have been repeated attempts to identify the locality described by the poet with the present
geography of Ithaca. Travelers have imagined that they have found the haven and cave, notably
this was the case with Sir William Gell; but the more common view now is that they were mistaken.
Homer from his knowledge of Greece, which has everywhere harbors, caves and olive-trees, constructed
an ideal landscape for his own purpose, quite as every poet does. He may or may not have seen
Ithaca; in either case, the poetic result is the same.

II. The physical transition from Phæacia to Ithaca is accomplished; while Ulysses is asleep,
the poet casts a glance backward at the marvelous ship and at the marvelous land which has
just been left behind. Both are henceforth to be forever closed to the real world and its intercourse;
the realm of fable is shut off from Ithaca, and from the rest of this poem.

The matter is presented in the form of a conflict between the Phæacians and Neptune, between
the sea-faring people and the sea; clearly it is one of the many struggles between Man and
Nature which the Greek Mythus is always portraying, because these struggles were the ever-present
fact in Greek life. The God has been circumvented by the speed of the navigators; Ulysses without
suffering, without a storm, has reached Ithaca. "No more honor for me from mortals or Gods,"
cries Neptune, "if I can be thus defied?" He makes his appeal to the Highest God, and we hear
the decision: "Turn the ship to a stone and hide the city with a mountain." The first is accomplished
in view of the Phæacians; the second is possibly prevented by their speedy sacrifices to Neptune,
and the new decree of the ruler, which forbids their giving further escort over the sea to
strangers. At any rate Phæacia is shut off from the world, and has not been heard of since;
there have been no more transitions thence since that of Ulysses. The marvelous ship and the
marvelous city vanish forever by a divine act, even by the will of Zeus. Yet, on the other
hand, they eternally remain, crystallized in these verses of Homer, more lasting than the rock
of Neptune.

Why this interference from above? Wherein is the escort by the Phæacians a violation of the
divine order as voiced by the Supreme God? Note that Ulysses has escaped, which is the will
of Zeus; note, too, that the Phæacians are punished for helping him escape, which is also the
will of Zeus. The sailors bring the wanderer to his home without trouble, but they are smitten
by the God while returning.

For the primal suggestion of the legend, may we not say that the sea, that enormous force of
Nature with many reserved energies in its vast bosom, though bestrid and subdued by a ship,
at times breaks loose and destroys, in spite of skillful navigation and perfect machinery?
Still to-day the sea has a residue of the uncontrollable, and probably will have for some ages
to come. Neptune has not ceased from his wrath against the man of thought, who tries to straddle
and ride him, and Zeus still supports at times the Sea-god's appeal for honor, when his prerogative
is violated. Yet not always by any means, for Zeus belongs to the true Olympians, deities of
intelligence, who once put down the old Gods of Nature.

Still Nature has its right, nay, its law with the penalty. The poet looks upon the sea as a
great deity demanding sacrifice and honor. Furthermore, for every conquest made over it, there
is the counterstroke, the resistance, which is the vengeance of the God. Thus says Zeus: "If
any man, trusting in his own strength, refuses to give unto thee honor, always vengeance is
thine afterwards."

We have already noticed the creed of the poet to be that every action has its penalty; the
deed, even the good deed, is the fruit of a conflict and puts down something which has its
might, aye its right, which is soon to make itself felt in counteraction. Es rächt sich alles
auf Erden, sings our last world-poet in full harmony with his eldest brother. 

"yes."

"a palanquin?"

"four."

"indeed! Less see: charge is two dollars; four books two is eight-- yes, eight bill tax, please.
And to hurry it up, yesterday, if they will, for they have been a batch has been located of
kittens to Baldwin's, and i want out in ketch at young Baldwin before he go out. By way, when
did you must put that weathercock on their stable?"

"too."

"you wear't transform! Moreover, keep itself on, are so. Four times two is eight, and four--

"what do you mean by four buck levy weathervane? They is together
learn of thing."

"didn't, hey? Why, she arrive in poem of'great equipment.'they'mho set down thither been to

the apparatus is young to tax."

"Destiny. Slingsby, that is the thing i are always heard out of. You might be just be as well talk
of siemens twins."

"Butter-- you don'we mean to Butterwick has crystal?
Why, surely they'rhenium nonexempt. They come in cognition of'inquiry-capitation.'three

on memoranda-book.

A day or two afterward. Slingsby called
to see, and he state, "i've be get a case that bothers they distracted
like thunder.

You remain hough the tobacconist? Well,

that, will you? Why, we might have heathenism raging all over country,
and we couldn't feel a movement of who them. I'd a option that congenial
incidents under'graven ulysses,'merely they ain't mentioned, either.


III. Next comes the most important and longest portion of the Book, turning the glance forward
to Ithaca and the future, also to the great deed of the poem. A new deity appears when Neptune
vanishes, not a hostile power of Nature but a helpful spirit of Intelligence--it is the Goddess
of Wisdom, Pallas. This divine transition from the one God to the other is the real inner fact,
while the physical transition is but the outer setting and suggestion.

Accordingly, the theme now is the man and the deity, Ulysses and Pallas in their interrelation.
We are to have a complete account of the human unfolding into a vision of the divine. The movement
is from a complete separation of the twain, to mutual recognition, and then to co-operation.
Pallas has had little to do with Ulysses during his great sea-journey, and since he left Troy.
That long wandering on the water was without her, lay not at all in her domain, which is that
of clear self-conscious Intelligence. That misty Fableland is the realm of other divinities,
though she appeared in Phæacia.

The question, therefore, is at present: How shall this man come into the knowledge of the Goddess?
How shall he know the truth of the reality about him in his new situation, how understand this
world of wisdom? The sides are two: the man and the deity, and they must become one in spirit.
The supreme thing, therefore, is that Ulysses hear the voice of Pallas, and develop into unity
with her; indeed that may be held to be the supreme thing in Religion and Philosophy: to hear
the voice of God. Even in the business of daily life the first object is to find out the word
of Pallas.

Such is the dualism in the world, which must be harmonized; but in the individual also there
is another dualism which has to be harmonized. Ulysses is mortal, finite, given over to doubt,
passion, caprice, is the unwise man, subjective; but he is also the wise man, has an infinite
nature which is just the mastery of all his weakness; he has always the possibility of wisdom,
and will come to it by a little discipline. He will rise out of his subjective self into the
objective God. This is just the process which the poet is now going to portray; the Hero overwhelmed
in his new situation and with his new problem, is to ascend into communion with Pallas, is
to behold wisdom in person and hear her voice, and then is to advance to the deed. This process
we may look at in four different stages, as they unfold on the lines laid down by the poet.

1. First we have quite a full picture of Ulysses before he reaches the recognition of the Divine,
and of his gradual climbing-up to that point. At the start he is asleep, is not even conscious
of the external world about him, he has indeed entered a new realm, yet old. As long as the
Phæacian spell is upon him, he can do nought but slumber. Then he wakes, he sees but does not
recognize his own country. He doubts, he blames the Phæacians wrongfully, in his distrust of
them he counts over his treasures. He is now the unwise, capricious man; he has no perception
of Pallas; not only the land is in disguise to him, he is in disguise to himself, to his better
self.

Yet the poet is careful to mark the providential purpose just in this disguise. The Goddess
threw a mist over things, that he might not know them, or make himself known till all was in
readiness for the destruction of the Suitors, till she had told him what he had to do. Still
it is his own act or state that he cannot at first hear the voice of the Goddess.

The next step is that he recognizes the country, it is described to him and named by Pallas.
But she is in disguise now; she has appeared, but not in her true form; she is not yet wisdom,
but simply identifies the land, telling him: "This is Ithaca." Thus he recognizes the external
landscape, but not the Goddess, who is as yet but a simple shepherd describing things.

Now what will he do? He also will disguise himself to the shepherd, because he does not recognize
who it is. He makes up a fable to account for his presence and for his goods. Both are now
in disguise, the man and deity, to each other. They are doing the same thing, they are one,
with that thin veil of concealment between them.

Then comes the mutual recognition. She tears away the veil, laughs at his artifice, and calls
out her own designation: Pallas Athena. She had previously named Ithaca, which brings the recognition
of the outer world; now she names herself, which brings the recognition of the divine world.
Thus Ulysses has rapidly passed from sleep through a series of non-cognizant states, till he
beholds the Goddess.

2. Both the deity and mortal have now reached the stage of mutual recognition, and thrown off
their mutual disguise, which was a false relation, though it often exists. Does not the man
at times conceal himself to the God, by self-deception, self-excuse, by lying to his higher
nature? In such case is not the God also hidden, in fact compelled to assume a mask? Thus the
poet brings before us the wonderful interplay between the human and divine, till they fully
recognize each other.

At once Pallas changes, she assumes a new form, the outward plastic shape corresponding to
her Godhood in the Greek conception, that of "a woman beautiful and stately." Nor must we forget
that Ulysses has also changed, the two transformations run parallel, in the spirit of the man
and in the form of the Goddess. This unity of character also is stated by Pallas; "both of
us are skilled in wiles; thou art the best of mortals in counsel and in words; I am famed among
the Gods for wisdom and cunning." Hence her argument runs, let us throw off disguise to each
other, for we have a great work before us.

It is also to be noted by the reader that each, the man and the Goddess, ascribes to the other
the credit of skill and forethought, specially the credit of coming to Ithaca in disguise to
discover the true situation. Says Pallas: "Another man would have rushed to see wife and children
in his house, but thou wilt first test thy wife." Here the Goddess gives the thought to the
man. Says Ulysses: "Surely I would have perished in my own palace, like Agamemnon, if thou,
O Goddess, hadst not told me everything aright." Here the man gives the thought to the Goddess.
This is not a contradiction, both are correct, and the insight is to see that both are one,
and saying the same thing at bottom. The deity must be in the man, as well as in the world;
and the man must hear the deity speaking the truth of the world ere he attain unto wisdom.

Even the mist which hung over the landscape at first, has now completely vanished; Ulysses
recognizes all the local details--the haven, the olive-tree, the grot of the Nymphs, and the
mountain; all the Ithacan objects of Nature come back fully. But chiefly he recognizes the
Goddess, whereupon both can pass to the great matter in hand--the deed.

3. This deed has been often mentioned before--the purification of Ithaca, chiefly by the slaughter
of the Suitors, "the shameless set, who usurp thy house and woo thy wife." Sitting on the roots
of the sacred olive, the two, the man and the deity, plan destruction to the guilty. Verily
those double elements, the human and the divine, must co-operate if the great action be performed.
The eternal principle of right, the moral order of the world, must unite with the free agency
of the individual in bringing about the regeneration of the land. Thus after their complete
recognition and harmony, which takes place out of separation, Ulysses and Pallas look forward
to the impending deed, which is their unity realized and standing forth as a fact in the world.

4. Finally we have the manner of doing the deed, the plan is laid before us. Pallas tells Ulysses
that he must again assume his disguise, both in the hut of the swineherd and in the palace
at Ithaca. She does not propose to do his work for him; on the contrary it must be his own
spontaneous energy. In fact, Pallas is in him making this suggestion, yet outside of him, too,
speaking the voice of the situation.

The scheme shows the structure of these four Books (XIII-XVI), organized of course by Pallas.
Ulysses is to go to the swineherd who is loyal, and will give shelter. Telemachus is to be
brought to the same place by Pallas, not externally, as we shall see, but through the free
act of Telemachus himself. Thus the three chosen men are gathered together in their unsuspected
fortress. Two things we must note in regard to these movements: they are wholly voluntary on
part of the persons making them, yet they belong in the Divine Order, and thus are the work
of the deity. Free-Will and Providence do not trammel each other, but harmoniously co-operate
to the same end. So carefully and completely is this thought elaborated that we may consider
it fundamental in the creed of the poet.

In such manner the weak, finite Ulysses is brought into communion with the immortal Goddess.
Yet he, the poor frail mortal, drops for a moment even here. When Pallas speaks of Telemachus
having gone to Sparta, to learn about his father, Ulysses petulantly asks: "Why did not you,
who know all things, tell that to him" without the peril of such a journey? The answer of Pallas
is clear; I sent him in order that he might be a man among men, and have the good fame of his
action. Telemachus, too, must be a free man; that is the education of Pallas. The Goddess will
help him only when he helps himself. Divinity is not to sap human volition, but to enforce
it; she would unmake Telemachus, if she allowed him to stay at home and do nothing, tied to
his mother's apron strings.

And here we cannot help noting an observation on Homer's poetry. It must be in the reader ere
he can see it in the book. Unless he be ready for its spirit, it will not appear, certainly
it will not speak. There must be a rise into the vision of Homeric poetry on the part of the
reader, as there is a rise into the vision of the Goddess on the part of Ulysses. The two sides,
the human and the divine, or the Terrestrial and the Olympian, must meet and commune; thus
the reader, too, in perusing Homer, must become heroic and behold the Gods.

BOOK FOURTEENTH.

The Book begins with another transition in place; Ulysses passes from the sea-shore, with its
haven, grot, and olive-tree up into the mountain, to the hut of Eumæus. We have quite a full
description of the latter's abode; there is a lodge surrounded by a court and a wall; within
this inclosure are the sties, and the droves of swine over which he is the keeper, with four
assistants. Nor must we omit the fierce dogs, savage as wild beasts. Such is the new environment
which Ulysses enters, and which has at its center a human being who gives character to this
little world. Again we catch a clear quick glimpse of the Greek landscape in one of its phases.

The spiritual transition is, however, the main thing. Ulysses passes from Pallas, the deity
of pure wisdom, to Eumæus, the humblest of mortals in his vocation. Yet this poor man too has
the divine in him, and manifests it in a supreme degree, not, however, in the form of reflective
wisdom, but in the form of piety, of an immediate faith in the Gods. Still this faith has its
sore trial. Such is the contrast between the two men. Ulysses has brought with him the Goddess
of Wisdom, whose words he has heard, and with whom he has held communion. Hardly does Eumæus
know Pallas, he has not the internal gift of seeing her in her own shape. Thus both these men
share in the divine, but in very different ways.

From this difference in the two men spring both the character and the matter of the Book. It
is a play, a disguise; a play between Wisdom and Faith, in which the former must be in disguise
to the latter, yet both have the same substance at bottom. For Faith is Faith because it cannot
take the form of Intelligence, yet may have in its simple immediate form all the content of
Intelligence.

Eumæus has an open single-hearted piety; he cannot play a disguise, he hates it for he has
been deceived by it when assumed by lying fablers. For this reason he is not intrusted with
the secret of his master's return till the last moment, he would have to dissemble, to violate
his own nature, and then perhaps he would not have succeeded in his attempt. So Ulysses with
a true regard for his man withholds the great secret, and has to play under cover in order
to get the needful information.

Accordingly the present Book has a decided tinge of comedy. There is, on the one hand, the
disguise, external and internal--in garments and in identity; on the other hand, there is the
error which takes one person for another, and produces the comic situation. Thus the Book is
prophetic of a great branch of Literature, and may be considered as a starting-point of Greek
Comedy, yes, as one of the origins of Shakespeare. To be sure, it is not mere fun or amusement;
it is the Comedy of Providence, who often is in disguise bringing his blessing. Eumæus in his
piety has just that which he thinks he has not; his loyalty has brought to him just that which
he most desired; his mistake is in reality no mistake, but a mere appearance which will vanish
in the end.

It is true that this sport of comic disguise began in the previous Book with Pallas. But can
the mortal hide himself from the deity, specially from the deity of wisdom? Hence the Goddess
tears away the mask with a smile, and there follows the recognition. But at present it is the
mortal who is the victim of disguise, by virtue of his limitations. Still the mortal, when
he cannot see, can believe, and so transcend these same limitations. Thus it is with Eumæus,
his mistake is a comic nullity.

In the hut of the swineherd, there is no domestic life, the woman is absent. This condition
is specially ascribed to the present state of things in Ithaca. Eumæus, though he be a slave,
could have a household, "a dwelling and ground and wife," if his old master were at home. Even
now he has his own servant, bought with his own wealth. Slavery was not a hard condition in
the house of Ulysses; it was domestic in the best sense probably. Indeed the slaves were often
of as high birth as their masters, who in turn might be slaves in the next fluctuation of war.
Eumæus himself was of kingly blood, and he retains his regal character in his servitude.

Ulysses has now reached the fortress which is to be the rallying-point of his army of three
heroes, and from which he is to issue to the work of the time. But that is hereafter. In the
present Book, we have his play with Eumæus, his disguise, which assumes three main attitudes.
First, he is passive, chiefly asking and listening; thus he gets out of Eumæus what information
he wishes; then he plays an active part in his disguise, telling his own history under the
mask of fiction; finally he assumes an open disguise, that is, he tells of one of his artifices
at Troy, and then states his present object in telling it. The simple Eumæus, however, does
not suspect him in all these transformations. Still we may notice in the swineherd a strong
feeling of oneness with the stranger, an unconscious presentiment of who he is.

I. The approach of Ulysses to the lodge of Eumæus is an experience which one may have in the
mountains of Greece to-day. We can find the same general outline of a hut with its surrounding
fence and court, in which domestic animals are penned, particularly during the night. Then
there is that same welcome from the dogs, which issue forth in a pack with an unearthly howling,
growling and barking at the approaching stranger, till somebody appear and pelt them with stones.
Often must the wandering Homer have had such a greeting! The hospitable swineherd, Eumæus,
the poet must have met with in his travels; the whole scene and character are drawn directly
from real life. A similar reception we have had in a remote pastoral lodge, dogs included. "Well,
not on the hand is the artifact has time does not look a corrupt
hints."

"Crooked is not a word. Colonel, I know these woman. I have had my receptor in them introduced. She'looked

off been like story. Also he hears again of the Suitors and their guilty
deeds, viewed with a loyal eye. Finally he plays the prophet to Eumæus and foretells the return
of Ulysses. This is the height of his disguise, wherein he rises to the humor of Providence,
who has brought to the swineherd the realization of his strongest wish without his knowing
it. His prayers have come to pass, could he but see. Herein Ulysses suggests the part of Providence
in disguise, bringing the fulfillment of his own prophecy.

II. It is now the turn of Ulysses to give some account of himself in answer to the swineherd's
pressing questions. He tells a famous story, a fiction of his own life, yet it has in its disguise
the truth of his career. The outer setting is changed, but the main facts are the same. Still
there is enough difference to prevent it from being a repetition. It is the Odyssey told over
again with new incidents, and variations upon an old theme. We behold here the conscious storyteller,
clothing the events of life in the garb of a marvelous adventure. Ulysses had in mind his own
experience in this account, and he adapts it to the time and place.

The main points of its contact with himself we may note. First, there is the pre-Trojan period,
a time of roving and marauding, which is true of that age in general, and may have some touch
of Ulysses in particular. Second is the Trojan war, the epoch of heroic conflict to which all
had to go, so strong was the public sentiment. Third comes the post-Trojan epoch, with the
wanton attack on the Ægyptians, very much like the attack upon the Ciconians in the Ninth Book.
From these attacks in both cases the grand calamity results, which causes the long wandering.
The Phoenician episode, however, has no counterpart in the career of Ulysses. Fourth is the
storm at sea, with the clinging to the mast, and the landing upon the coast of the Thesprotians,
all of which is a transcript of the experience of Ulysses in getting to Phæacia from Calypso's
isle. Fifth is the arrival at Ithaca, which shows the actual fact, with changed circumstances.
Thus we may say that the true Ulysses in disguise tells the true story of his life in disguise.
This gift is what makes him the poet.

Indeed we are compelled to think that Homer here suggests his own poetic procedure. What he
narrates is his own experience, in the form of art. His poetry is and must be his own life,
though in disguise. Goethe has said something similar: All that I have written is what I have
experienced, but not quite as I experienced it. In this story we may hear in an undertone the
old Greek poet telling one of his secrets of composition.

Moreover, it is a tale of providential escapes; thrice has the so-called Cretan been saved
specially, in Ægypt, from the Phoenicians, from the Thesprotians. Thus the story aims to encourage
Eumæus, and to answer his doubt; it affirms the return of Ulysses, and tells even the manner
thereof; it is a story of Providence appealing to the swineherd's faith. On this line, too,
it touches the ethical content of the Odyssey, as the latter was sung to the whole Greek world.

Looking at the external circumstances of the story we note that it takes them from the social
life of the time. There is universal slavery, with its accompaniment, man-stealing; the pirate
and the free-booter are still on the seas and furnish incidents of adventure, yet commerce
has also begun; the perils of navigation turn the voyage into a series of miraculous escapes.
It is a time of dawn in which many distinctions, now clear, have not yet been made.

We may also see the lines, though they be faint, of the movement of the world's culture in
this story. Crete, on the borderland between East and West, is the home of the daring Greek
adventurer who attacks Troy on the one hand and Ægypt on the other. Order was about as follows: "after a careful examination of the Bradley

BOOK FIFTEENTH.

In contrast with the previous Book, the present Book has not so much disguise; Ulysses falls
somewhat into the background, and several undisguised characters came forward. Still there
are points in common, the most striking of which is the tale of Eumæus, the correspondence
of which with the tale of Ulysses in the Fourteenth Book impresses itself upon every careful
reader.

But the main fact of the present Book is the bringing together of the various threads for the
grand final enterprise, which is the punishment of the guilty Suitors. Ulysses and Eumæus are
already on hand; to them now Telemachus is to be added, who comes from Sparta, whither he had
gone for the completion of his education. Thus the present Book goes back and connects with
the Fourth Book in which we left Telemachus. Still further, the Ithakeiad is linked into and
continues the Telemachiad (the first four Books), inasmuch as we now see the purpose of that
famous journey of the son to the courts of Nestor and Menelaus. It was the training for a deed,
a great deed which required knowledge, skill, and resolution, and which was to show the youth
to be the son of his father.

Such is another organic link which binds the whole Odyssey together. The two threads, separately
developed hitherto, are now united and interwoven with a third, that of Eumæus. Telemachus
has seen two Trojan heroes and heard their varied history, he has learned about his father
whom he is prepared in spirit to support. So the son has his Return also, a small one, yet
important, be returns to Ithaca after the experience at Pylos and Sparta and is joined to the
great Return of his father.

But just here with these evident marks of unity in the poem, occurs a slip in chronology which
has given the most solid comfort to those who wish to break up the Odyssey and assign its parts
to different authors. In the Fourth Book (l. 594) Telemachus proposes to set out at once for
home, he will not be detained even by the charm of Menelaus and Helen. That was the 6th day
of the poem, whereas we find him here leaving Sparta on 36th day of the poem, according to
the usual reckoning. Two inferences have been drawn from this discrepancy, if it be a discrepancy.
The Wolfian School cries out in chorus: two different poets for the two different passages;
it would have been impossible for old Homer singing without any written copy thus to forget
himself, whatever a modern author might do with the manuscript or printed page before him.
The other set of opinions will run just in the opposite direction: the connection between the
Fourth and the Fifteenth Books is perfect, as far as thought, narrative, and incident are concerned;
the ancient listener and even the modern reader could pay no attention to the intricate points
of chronology in the poem, especially when these points lay more than ten Books or 5,000 lines
apart from each other. There is no real sign of discrepant authorship, therefore, but rather
a new indication of unity.

The general theme of the Book is, accordingly, the Return of Telemachus, and his uniting with
his father and the swineherd, who are still further characterized in their relation. The structure
of the Book falls easily into three portions: first is the separation of Telemachus from Menelaus
and Helen till his departure on the ship; second is the end to which he is moving just now,
the hut of Eumæus, where are Ulysses and the swineherd, the latter of whom tells his tale of
discipline and is seen to be a hero too in his sphere; the third part is the coming of Telemachus.

I. In the departure of Telemachus from Sparta, we witness the divine and human elements again
in co-operation. The former is represented by Pallas who came down to Sparta to "remind the
son of Ulysses of his Return(nostos)." She appears to him in the night as he lies awake full
of care; he is ready to see her plan and so she appears on the spot and tells it, not in the
form of a dream. In the first place, he is to hasten home in order to save his substance, which
is threatened with new loss through the possible marriage of Penelope with one of the suitors,
Eurymachus. The son (through the mouth of Pallas) here shows some bitter feeling toward his
mother, whose mind be manifestly does not understand; she is altogether too subtle for her
own boy, who has not seen through her disguises. In the second place Pallas warns him against
the ambush of the Suitors, which was no doubt his own forecast of the situation. In the third
place, the Goddess sends him to the hut of the faithful swineherd, whose character he must
have already known. In this speech of Pallas we feel everywhere the subjective element; she
is certainly the voice of Telemachus, yet also the voice of the situation; the divine and human
side easily come together, with a stronger tinge of the human than is usual in Homer. Still
we must not forget that Pallas, Goddess of Intelligence, suggests the processes of mind more
directly than any other deity. Thus we again see that Pallas is the organizer of the poem;
she brings its threads together through her foresight; she sends Telemachus where he unites
with Ulysses and Eumæus.

The separation from Menelaus and Helen is told in the style of lofty hospitality. Menelaus
brings as his present a wine-bowl wrought by divine skill, "the work of Vulcan," which was
given him by the king of the Sidonians--another glance back to Phoenicia and its art. Helen
gives a garment of her own making, which thou shalt preserve as "a keepsake of Helen" till
the day of thy marriage, "when thy bride shall wear it." A most beautiful motive, worthy indeed
of Helen and of Helen's art; Telemachus is to transfer to his bride, and to her alone, his
"keepsake of Helen," his memory of her, his ideal gotten during this journey. Finally Helen
appears as prophetess and foretells the total destruction of the Suitors at the hands of returning
Ulysses. Such is the last appearance of Helen to Telemachus, giving strong encouragement, suggesting
in her two acts a new outlook for the youth both upon Family and State. No wonder his words
to her rise into adoration: "Zeus so ordering, there at home I shall pray unto thee as unto a God."

Telemachus in his return will not pass through Pylos lest he be delayed by the importunate
hospitality of good old Nestor. And indeed what can he gain thereby? He has already seen and
heard the Pylian sage. So he sends the latter's son home while he himself goes aboard his ship.
But just before he sets sail, there comes "a stranger, a seer, a fugitive, having slain a man."
Theoclymenus it is, of the prophetic race of Melampus, the history of which is here given.
The victim of a fateful deed now beseeches Telemachus for protection and receives it; the prophet
hereafter will give his forewarnings to the Suitors. Yet he could not save himself from his
own fate in spite of his foresight; so all the seers of the family of Melampus have a strain
of fatality in them; they foreknow, but cannot master their destiny.

II. The scene shifts (l. 301) to the hut of the swineherd, which is the present destination
of Telemachus. The reader beholds a further unfolding of the character of Eumæus, in fact this
portion of the Book might be called his discipline or preparation to take part in the impending
enterprise.

Ulysses still further tests the charity and humanity of the swineherd by offering to go to
town in order to beg for his bread among the Suitors, as well as to do their menial tasks.
Whereat Eumæus earnestly seeks to dissuade him, reminding him of the insolence of those men
and of their elegant servants in livery, and assuring him that "no one here is annoyed at thy
presence, neither I nor the others." Well may Ulysses respond to such a manifestation of charity.
"May thou be as dear to Zeus, the Father, as thou art to me!"

The stranger now tests the swineherd's interest in and devotion to Laertes and Eurycleia, who
are the parents of Ulysses, the old father and mother of the house. So Eumæus gives an account
of his relation to them, as well as to Ktimene, sister of Ulysses; "with her I was reared,
and was honored by her mother only a little less." Eumæus will soon tell how he came so young
to the family of Laertes. Indeed Ulysses is moved by his narrative to ask just this question.
It is to be noted that the report of the swineherd about Penelope is not so certain; "from
the queen I have had no kindly word or deed, since that evil fell upon her house--the haughty
Suitors." Here lies one motive why Ulysses must go to the palace and test Penelope. Thus Eumæus
shows his love for the family of Ulysses, and responds deeply to the test of universal charity.

Very naturally rises the question as to the history of his life. What experience has called
forth such a marvelous character? Eumæus now gives his fateful story. The Phoenician background
is again employed, with its commerce in merchandise, with its stealing and selling of free,
high-born people into slavery, with its navigation. The pith of the story is, a Phoenician
female slave, who had been stolen and bought by the king of the country, plays false to her
master, steals his child and what valuables she can carry off, and escapes on a Phoenician
trading vessel after an intrigue with one of its crew. The captive woman avenged her wrong,
but was struck on "the seventh day by Diana, archer-queen," for her own double guilt. Eumæus
was that child, also stolen and enslaved, but he is her emphatic contrast; he has been able
fully to digest his fate. The Phoenician galley came to Ithaca, "and there Laertes purchased
me." The swineherd is of royal birth and retains his more than royal character; in being the
humblest he can rise to the highest.

Interesting touches of the Phoenician traders are given: "Sharp fellows, having myriads of
trinkets in their ship:" surely it is the ancient Semitic retailer of jewelry, going from town
to town in his boat. Then note specially "the cunning man who came to my father's house, showing
a golden necklace strung with amber beads;" this amber was obtained doubtless through commerce
from the Baltic, by the Phoenicians, whose workmanship is also suggested. "The palace servants
and my mother took the trinket into their hands, turning it over and over; they kept gazing
at it haggling about the price;" the same scene can be witnessed today in our own country towns
when the Jewish peddler appears in the household. In the present case, however, it was part
of the scheme of stealing the child.

Eumæus says that his father ruled a city in the island of Syria. But where is this Syria? Some
think it is conceived by Homer as lying in the extreme West, "where the Sun turns;" but the
Sun turns anywhere. Rather is its position eastward toward Phoenicia; the Taphian pirates who
stole the Sidonian woman and sold her into Syria, dwelt not far from Ithaca and preyed upon
Phoenician commerce, stealing and selling in the Eastern Mediterranean. Certainly they could
find little business of their kind in the West. Some vague idea of the actual land of Syria
must have flashed in Homer's mind; no more definite description is possible.

It is plain, however, that the poet makes Eumæus a foreigner, not a Greek, whose birth-land
lies beyond the Hellenic boundary to the East. But he is not a Phoenician, his character is
different, and his people seem not to have been sea-faring. His fundamental trait is religiosity;
he lives in the eternal presence of the Divine Ruler of the World. His character is that of
the Old Testament; some of his utterances are strong reminders of the Psalms. We cannot help
reading in him something of David and of Job; misfortune he here has had, but he retains an
unshaken faith in the deity; intense wrestling he shows, but it has been with him the process
of purification. He is not a Greek at all; he has a Hebrew character, not of the modern mercantile
type, which resembles more the Phoenician, but of the old Hebrew strain. In those times of
man-stealing, Homer could easily have met him in one of the Greek islands, a slave yet a spiritual
prince, have drawn his portrait, and have heard his story substantially as here given.

Indeed we think we can trace in the swineherd's thoughts and sometimes in his expressions a
marked monotheistic tendency. Undoubtedly Eumæus speaks fluently of the Greek Gods, as Diana
and Apollo; especially does he mention and honor Zeus, the supreme God; still he is prone to
employ the word Gods in the unitary sense of Providence, and he repeatedly uses the singular
God without the article, as in the passage: "God grants some things and withholds others at
his will, for he is all-powerful" (XIV. 444). And it is characteristic that he does not like
Helen, for thus he says in an outburst of anti-Greek spirit: "O would that Helen and her tribe
had utterly perished, for whose sake so many fell!" (XIV. 68.) Striking is his contrast herein
with the Phæacians, and with their love of the Trojan conflict.

We have already stated that this entire Ithakeiad resembles the novel, giving pictures of the
social life of the time, and elevating the humblest man into heroship. In like manner, this
story of Eumæus might almost be called a novelette, truly an Homeric novelette interwoven into
the greater totality of the novel here presented in the Ithakeiad, and finally into the entire
Odyssey. It has its correspondence with the Fairy Tale of the previous portions of the poem,
yet stands in sharpest contrast. Here is no supernatural world far away, but it is the present,
it is human life just now, and the hero lives before us. Here are no superhuman beings, like
Calypso, Circe, Polyphemus, Proteus; the environment, the coloring, the art-form are totally
changed. Nor is it an heroic tale of Troy, with its order of Gods, descending and interfering
in human affairs; no grand exploits of arms, no mighty mustering of glorious warriors. Not
high and magnificent Achilles in all the pride of his colossal individuality, but humble Eumæus,
a slave and a swineherd, has become the Homeric hero. Surely a new style, and a new world-view;
yet surely Homer's, not the work of any other man.

It has been already made plain that we have passed from the Idyl, and Heroic Epos, and the
Fairy Tale of the first portions of the Odyssey into the Social Romance, which takes the picture
of society as its setting. Every human being can now be made a slave; man-stealing, woman-stealing,
child-stealing, give the motives for the strangest turns of destiny. Already Ulysses in his
fictitious tale of the previous Book has become a maker of the novelette; but Eumæus tells
a true tale of his own life, it has no disguise; he knows his past, he is aware of his origin.
Thus he is an example, showing how the man is still a fate-compeller in such a state of society.
Though a slave externally, he can still be a king within; though struck by the hardest blow
of destiny he can still remain loyal to the Divine Order and obtain its blessing.

It is interesting to note the significance of this Phoenician background, with its universal
commerce. The Phoenician traded already in remote antiquity with the extremes of the Aryan
race, from India in the East to Britain in the West, including the whole intervening line of
Aryan migration, Persia, Greece, Italy, Gaul. The Aryan race is indeed a separative, self-repellent,
distracted race, always on the move out of itself, without returning into itself. The Phoenician,
on the contrary, in his farthest voyages, came back home with news and merchandise; the remotest
Phoenician settlements kept up their connection with the mother country. Deep is the idea of
the Return to the parent city in the Semitic consciousness for all time; the Phoenician returned
anciently to Tyre and Sidon; the Arab Mahommedan returns to-day to Mecca, home of the Prophet;
the Jew experts to return to Jerusalem, the holy city of his fathers. The entire Odyssey may
well be supposed to show a Semitic influence, in distinction from the Iliad, for the Odyssey
is the account of many returns and of the one all-embracing Return to home and country. It
is, therefore, very suggestive that the Odyssey has this Phoenician background of a world-commerce,
which is only possible for a city whose people, going forth, come back to it as a center. Moreover
this world-commerce is a kind of unification of the ever-separating Aryan race, a bond created
through the exchange of commodities. Thus the Semitic character has always shown itself as
the unifier and mediator of Aryan peoples, first through an external tie of trade, which was
the work of Phoenicia, and, secondly, through the far deeper spiritual tie of religion, which
was the later work of Judea. The Semitic mind has always been necessary to the inherently centrifugal
Aryan soul in order to bring it back to itself from its wanderings, inner and outer, and to
reconcile itself with itself and with the Divine Order. The Semite has been and still is the
priest to all Arya, by the deepest necessity of the spirit.

Another word we may add in this connection. The Semitic race has also separated itself, and
shown three main branches--Phoenician, Hebrew, Arab--a sea-people, a land-people, and a sand-people.
In all three cases, however, they have a returning and therewith a mediating character. In
their wildest wanderings, on water, and in the desert, and in the soul, they have the power
of getting back; and that which they do for themselves, they aid others in doing.

So much by way of tracing the universal relations of this poem with its Phoenician background
of commerce as well as with its Semitic character of Eumæus. For, somehow, we cannot help seeing
in this latter certain traits of the old Hebrew.

III. The last part of the Book returns to Telemachus and his ship; he has escaped the men in
ambush, and has reached the Ithacan shore at a distance from the palace; he sends the vessel
to the town while he goes to the hut of the swineherd in accord with the plan of the Goddess.

But he has on his hands the seer Theoclymenus, whom he first thinks of sending to one of the
Suitors; but when the seer utters a favorable prophecy, Telemachus sends him to one of his
own friends for entertainment. A curious touch of policy; it was well to have the prophet in
a friendly house, where he might be ready for service; even prophetic vision can be colored
by personal attachments.

the deity present, and not run off like a dog. If he does not see the Goddess, as in the case
with Telemachus here, he is simply outside of her influence.

Pallas gives to Ulysses the strong promise of help, reflecting his own internal condition.
She transforms him, he appears a new man, nay a God to his son, "some divinity whose home is
the broad heaven." Then the recognition follows, with its various doubts and its emotional
ups and downs. "In the breasts of both rose the desire of tears; they wept shrilly, and louder
their screams than those of the eagle whose young have been stolen from its nest." Lamentation
is a trait of the Homeric hero; in the present case it asserts its fullest right. But enough!
let us pass from heroic tears to heroic deeds.

(3) Next comes the general plan of action. What have we to encounter? Telemachus gives a catalogue
of the Suitors; they reach the surprising number of 108 persons plus 10 attendants, including
the bard and the herald. We now begin to appreciate the greatness of the task. The Ithacan
people are helpless or hostile, the Suitors have friends and relatives everywhere, yet they
must be punished, they cannot be allowed to escape. But the aid for such an enterprise--whence?
asks Telemachus, and also the reader. Listen to the answer of Ulysses: "I shall tell thee,
and thou bear it well in mind; think whether Pallas with her father Zeus be not sufficient
for us, or shall I look about for some other defender?" Such a believer has the skeptic become;
he now has faith in the Gods, and in a World Order. It is also a lofty expression of belief
in his divine mission; the spirit of Eumæus, which dwells in that humble hut, has entered the
heart of the hero. Such are the two allies: Pallas, wisdom, and Zeus, fountain of the world's
justice, which had been deeply violated by the Suitors. Telemachus in response, assents to
his father's words, and acknowledges the supremacy of the Gods. He also lays aside his doubt
and shows himself in a spiritual harmony with his father, which must be antecedent to the deed.

The next part of the plan is that Ulysses in disguise shall go to the palace and see for himself
the wrongs done to his House, and experience some of these wrongs in his own person. Then too
he can make preparations on the spot and select the time for striking. Also he wishes to test
a little further the wife Penelope. Another period of disguise is necessary in order to get
rid of the necessity of disguise and vindicate the right. Zeus is with him, he is the bearer
of universal justice, which he is to establish anew; but Pallas must also be with him in the
act, for it requires all his skill and cunning and forethought.

Thus the father and son are united in spirit; the last obstacle, which was the disguise, is
removed, and they behold each other as they are in truth. The recognition is not merely an
external one of face and form, or even of the tie of kinship and affection; it is in both a
recognition of the Divine Order of the World, which they are now called upon to maintain in
their own persons, and to re-stablish in their country.

II. The scene passes from the hut of the swineherd to the palace, where the Suitors soon hear
of the safe return of Telemachus. Antinous also comes back, foiled and evidently angered; he
proposes to the Suitors that they should slay Telemachus "in the fields or on the highway"
wherever found, or renounce the suit for Penelope in the palace: "Let each one woo her from
his own house with gifts."

It is clear that such a violent measure as the assassination of the royal heir in his own territory
finds small response even among the Suitors. Antinous says that the people are no longer friendly;
he thinks, when they hear of the recent ambush, that they may rise and drive out the aggressors.
Still they do not rise, and probably Antinous tried to frighten the Suitors into his drastic
method. But he did not succeed, Amphinomus clearly voices their sentiment, and the council
dissolves.

Soon it is seen that Antinous has lost his cause. Penelope appears and gives him a thorough
tongue-lashing, in which she also tells his antecedents. "Thy father came to us, a fugitive
from the people," who were angry at him on account of his piratical misdeeds; "they wanted
to kill him, and tear out his heart, and pillage his large wealth" evidently gotten unlawfully.
"But Ulysses restrained them," and now this is your gratitude: "you waste his property, woo
his wife, slay his son, and worry me to death." Antinous is true to his ancestry, he is still
a pirate. Strong words are these, which call forth a hypocritical reply from another Suitor,
Eurymachus, which she probably saw through, for she goes into her upper chamber, where "she
weeps for her dear spouse Ulysses, till blue-eyed Pallas cast upon her eyelids sweet sleep."

The internal weakness of the Suitors is exposed; it is manifest that they are divided among
themselves. In fact, how can they have any unity? Each wishes to win the fair prize, which
can belong only to one; hence every other man is his rival, whom he tries to thwart. Hence
come jealousy and suspicion. The single bond they have in common is their wrong-doing, which
they feel cannot much longer continue, with Telemachus so active.

III. On the other hand, we pass to the hut of the swineherd, where the father and son show
a complete unity of spirit and purpose. Eumæus returns from his errand; he brings no news specially
except that the Suitors who formed the ambush have come back to the town. But he is not yet
to be admitted into the grand secret; so Pallas stood again near Ulysses, "striking him with
her staff she made him an old man in wretched rags." He resumes his disguise "lest the swineherd
might recognize him and hasten to announce the fact to Penelope, instead of keeping the secret
looked in his bosom." So the kind-hearted, sincere Eumæus cannot yet be entrusted with the
important secret.

BOOKS XVII-XXIV.

The time has arrived for this exposition of the Odyssey to be brought to a close with some
degree of rapidity. It has already expanded itself beyond its original purpose; it, too, like
Ulysses, has asserted itself as limit-transcending. We shall try to indicate the general character
of these remaining eight Books, to find their place in the total organism of the poem, and
then give a brief outline of each Book separately.

It has already often been stated that the Odyssey is a Return, an outer, but specially an inner
Return from the Trojan War and from the alienation and disruption produced by the same. This
Return, narrated in the twenty-four Books of the poem, divides itself into two equal halves,
each containing twelve Books. The first half moves about two centers, Telemachus and Ulysses;
the former is to be trained out of his ignorance, the latter is to be disciplined out of his
negative attitude toward institutional life, and thus be prepared to rescue institutional life.
The first twelve Books are, therefore, the getting rid of the destructive results caused by
the Trojan War and all war, in the human soul.

Still Ulysses, with Telemachus, is to do a deed of destruction, he is to destroy the Suitors,
who are themselves destructive of institutional order in Ithaca. In a general way they are
like the Trojans, they are assailing the domestic and political life of the Greek world; they
too must be put down at home by the hero, as Troy was put down abroad by him. But at Troy he
became negative through the long training of a ten years' war, the spirit of which he must
get rid of before he can slay the Suitors, for he is too much like them to be their rightful
destroyer. This, then, is the discipline of the first twelve Books: through the experience
of life to get internally free of that destructive Trojan spirit, to overcome the negative
within, and then proceed to overcome it without.

Now this overcoming of the negative without (embodied in the Suitors) is just the work of the
last twelve Books of the Odyssey, which we have called the Ithakeiad, as the scene is laid
wholly in Ithaca. Internally both Ulysses and Telemachus are ready; they have now externally
to make their world conform to their Idea. The trend of the poem is henceforth toward the deed
which destroys the outer negation, as hitherto the trend was toward the deed which overcame
the inner negation. To be sure, the destruction of the Suitors has hovered before the poem
from the beginning; but in the second half it is explicit, is the immediate end of the action.

This second half divides itself into two distinct portions. It being the direct movement toward
the deed shows in the first portion the preparation of the instruments, which takes place at
the hut of the swineherd. Ulysses is alone, he must find out upon whose aid he can rely; his
helpers must show not only strength of limb, but strength of conviction. Two persons appear--his
son and his swineherd; they believe themselves to be the bearers of a Divine Order as against
the Suitors; they are the army of three to whom the cowherd is to be hereafter added on manifesting
his loyalty. This part of the poem has been unfolded in the preceding four Books.

The second portion of this second half of the poem, consisting of eight Books, we are next
to consider. Ulysses has hitherto only heard of the excesses of the Suitors; he is now to see
them directly and to experience their violence in his own person. He is in disguise and gets
full possession of the fact before he proceeds to the deed. The insolent, destructive conduct
of the Suitors is set forth in all fullness, as well as the subtle attempt of the wife to thwart
them; then the blow falls which sweeps them and their deeds out of existence. Restoration follows
after this terrible act of vengence; Ulysses, having done his great destructive work, is to
show himself constructive, not simply the destroyer, but the healer and restorer.

How can we best see the sweep of these eight Books and their organic connection with the total
Odyssey? No mere formal division will answer, nor any external separation into parts. The inner
movement of the thought is to be found and shown as the organizing principle. On the whole
the joints of the structure are not so manifest as in the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad; still
they exist. Already it has been often said that the essential character of the Suitors is that
of destroyers; Ulysses is the destroyer of these destroyers; but in destroying destruction
he is also the restorer. Now just these three stages of the movement of the inner thought are
the three organic divisions of the last eight Books; that is, the thought organizes the poem.
Let us look more closely.

I. The first five Books (XVII-XXI) are devoted to revealing the Suitors as destroyers to Ulysses
in person, though he be disguised. Three strands are interwoven into the texture, which we
may separate for the purpose of an examination.

1. The Suitors are destroying what may in general be called the institutional world in its
three leading forms: (1) Property, (2) Family, (3) State. To these may be added their disregard
and even open defiance of the Gods, who are the upholders, or rather the personified embodiment
of all institutional life. Hence the statement may be made that the Suitors are, as far as
their deeds go, the destroyers of the Divine Order of the World; they are spiritually negative.

2. The second strand is that of Ulysses (to whom Telemachus and the swineherd can be added)
who is to behold with his own eyes, to experience in his own person, the character and acts
of the Suitors; then he is also to plan and prepare for their destruction. As he has overcome
his own negative condition inwardly, in the spirit, he must be able to overcome the same condition
outwardly, in the world.

3. The third strand is that of Penelope, the wife, who is seeking to thwart the attempt of
the Suitors to make her marry one of themselves; thus she is heroically preserving the Family.
She, with the loyal part of her household, co-operates with Ulysses, though not aware who he
is. Between the second and third strands are many interweavings, both being opposed to the
Suitors. Penelope, to delay her marriage, proposes the Bending of the Bow, which gives the
weapon and the opportunity to Ulysses. (Book XXI.)

II. The second stage of the grand movement is given in one Book (XXII). This is the single
bloody Book of the poem, it makes up all deficiencies in the way of sanguinary grewsomeness.
The destroying Suitors are themselves destroyed by Ulysses, who therein is destroyer. Hence
the blood-letting character of the Book and of the deed; 116 men skin, 12 women hung, and one
man mutilated unto death.

III. But the destroyer Ulysses destroys destruction, and so becomes positive; in the last two
Books he is shown as the restorer of the institutional order which the Suitors had assailed
and were undermining. He restores the Family (Book XXIII), and the State (Book XXIV). This
is, then, the end of the Return, indeed the end of the grand disruption caused by the Trojan
War, to which Ulysses set out from Ithaca twenty years before. The absence of the husband and
ruler from home and country gave the opportunity for the license of the Suitors. But the Return
has harmonized the distracted condition of the land; institutions, Family and State, are freed
of their conflict; even the Gods, Zeus and Pallas (authority and wisdom) enforce the new order,
bringing peace and concord.

Still, despite the bloody death of the Suitors, there runs through this portion of the Odyssey
(the last eight Books) a vein of charity, of humanity, sometimes even of sentiment, which seems
to link the poem with our own age. Yet the other side is present also; there is little pity
for the unrighteous, and justice is capable of becoming cruel. The Suitors and their set of
servants are represented as unfeeling and inhuman; Penelope and the whole loyal household on
the other hand show sympathy with poverty and misfortune. Such, indeed, has been their discipline,
that of adversity, which softens the heart toward the victims of hard luck.

The disguise of Ulysses is continued, and also the craft of Penelope. The moral questioning
which these two characters have always roused does not diminish. The hardest practical problem
of life comes to the front in their case. Both are willing to meet unjust violence with dissimulation,
till they get the power to act openly. They put down a dishonest world with dishonesty, and
then proceed to live honestly. It is another phase of that subtle play of the Negative, with
which Ulysses had to grapple repeatedly in Fableland, and of which the Odyssey is full. Every
situation seems to have its intricate ethical problem, which the reader has to solve as he
solves such questions in actual life. Our opinion upon this element in the poem we have already
given, and need not repeat it here.

We must note that Ulysses still keeps up his romancing in order to explain his presence in
Ithaca and his beggarly appearance. He introduces a kind of story, which we have called the
Novelette in distinction from the Fairy Tale. The scene is usually thrown back eastward to
Crete, the Trojan War furnishes the background, the famous Cretan hero Idomeneus is usually
in some way connected with the stranger who is speaking. Mister. Butterwick fix what he considered a
very showed material upon the culture of domestic fowls; and when airs case arrived, he was on
the program ready Trojans to the audience. The dickeybird were found around some youth in birdcage;
and when the presentation had been formally unfold by a chairman, the orator come again with his writing
in his hand.

Merely as he began to say it the black Telemachus cockerel to the period has noticed a soft and
compliant cock-a-doodle-doo. There were about two 100 in the hall, and the one of them thus begin
to crow in the property, and the dissonance able the cackler again a that they all cackled as
loudly they could.

Of the talker's androglossia could not be uttered, and he come out to a arrest, while the audience
laughed. After expect for ten proceedings silence was forward receive, and Butterwick begin a case.
As soon as he had learn the words "Begum and gentleman," a Polska
antinous penis, which seemed of a score against the alliterator, emitted
another crow, and all the other dorking in the room suffered in more
chorus.

The gallery roared, and Butterwick grew red in the countenance with feeling. But when the dissonance
has subsided, he travel at it saw so, and get as far as "Ladies and man, such cowshed-yard and poultry
affords the message sought of the interest to the--" when the rooster who become prosecute
in much game with an overgrown Shanghai poultry, and will bind this dentition the hens of the combatants
to cackle, and not to a time that collection to a uproar. This was
too much. Mister. Butterwick was beside himself with-- wrath. He
flung up his ms, hotfoot to be the coop, and shaking his fist at
the chicken cry, "you was diabolical fiend, i'event half cognition to the
assassination you!"

Then he recoil the enclosure to part were with his foot, and seize every cock writhe its neck
and been flung it suffered on the floor.

So he flee from a hall, postdate by deeds of laughter from the audience
and the clatter from the gallinacean.

The production was opened without further ceremony, and the treatise on the barn-garden fowl
was bestowed to be printed in the report of an foreclosure into the society. One time while i was
talking with Mister.

Keyser upon every subject of the penis he indicate to the broiler that there was roosting upon barrier,
and told me have a narrative about the dorking where i must refuse
to believe.

"possibly you merely noticed that rooster," said Keyser-- "very likely you wouldn't have observed
him; but i experience't wish out in what illume you seek of him, the
study, some gifted he stands.

You speak about your american iggles and vertebrate of freedom, but that unimportant-appear poultry
yonder can yield any pages of them twenty points and pouch at the shoot. That cock has attribute
of the'noise adorn about have any book." the gods are kinder unintelligent; but what do i like about
him is that he is sympathetic, he has impression. I know last season
that his Shanghai'hen was interrupted sick that she was trying to
concoct off the testis, and that chicken was immediately inhuman that
he utilize to enchantment dentition on a dog for hr, trying to help
her out, thus that she would go away animate after exercise.

And when she died, do he become correct in and take complaint of
property-- seemed to feel that he ought to be a father to those unborn
and little orphans; and he range around those foodstuff for though
thus old.

He is roost get much contentment of it, always. Another of them were drake'testis, and it look
toward gash him out when he appear at those birds after they concoct down. He took it to hub, and
there look to tweak high-spirited and smite. He would eastward go
off and stand nothing by himself two country on one pin in a corner of
the fence and let his head over his problem until you'letter sympathy
him.

It revolt him to think how the country it go out. "today, you wouldn't believe out some chicken
as that may have been much courage, but he'saw crete far as back has a wagon-burthen of tigers
as not. He get a head that that cockerel over thither on the church-steeple was animated, and
he could couldn't deliver to believe that it was up there sailing around and set on the over him, and
the bad the multiplication i've have been understand him appear to wing up at it, thus's to arrange a
fight. When he found he held about't append we, he'd crow at the cock
and presume it are to taken quite of who, and at last, when all his
efforts were useful, would you believe that rooster one tomorrow attacked
the sacristan as the weathercock's next amigo, and went his loop-line
here merely into a caretaker's shanks that he walked out on crutches
for more'note has this rag?

I had ne'er saw a broiler have the coarse id and the wear." he is
a person, anyway, never as he look.

Why, he had a dither with Starches's Polska rooster so the dorsum, and alternatively of travel
at him and taking the chances of acquire whipped, that broiler actually put himself into his
discipline, eat nothing but hominy, found unconstipated set, went of never middle, take that mikvah
many period and get most character to rub him up with a maize-cob.
 The dog Argo images the House of Ulysses at present; to such straits has fidelity
come. A famous statement here by Eumæus cannot be passed over: "The day which makes the man
a slave, Zeus takes half his worth away." True generally of men, but not of the slave who utters
it, he being the fate-compeller.

Ulysses now applies his test of charity to the Suitors. He goes around to them, asking for
alms, like a beggar, that he might observe them all, and "know who was better and who was worse."
But in the end not one of them was to be spared. Such was the supreme test, that of charity;
how will the Suitors treat the poor beggar? Will they behave toward him as Eumæus has? Not
by any means; the test calls out the worst suitor of the lot, Antinous, who finally hurls a
stool at the supposed intruder. The other Suitors give something, not their own; still they
share in the guilt. Is this test of charity, selected by the poet here, a true test of such
characters? One result of the present violation of law and order is inhumanity, cruelty, disregard
of the fellow-man. Especially marked is their contrast with Eumæus, who, in response to the
harshness of Antinous, says: "The famous men of earth (such as the seer, the doctor, the builder,
the bard) are invited to the feast; no one would invite a beggar to an entertainment." Still
the beggar is here to be invited. A ring of modern sentiment is surely heard in this passage;
the subjective element of Christendom seems embodied in that swineherd a thousand years before
its time.

The poet does not leave out of this Book the previous tendency of Ulysses to romancing. In
the talk with Antinous he begins another tale or rather the old one, with Egypt and Cyprus
in the background. It is, in substance, the story of the attack on the Ciconians, which Ulysses
cannot help telling when he looks back toward his Trojan period. Here again it is truth in
the form of fiction.

Meantime the uproar has called forth Penelope, who desires to see the strange beggar. The wish
is conveyed to Ulysses, who artfully requests that the interview be deferred till night-fall;
the wife might see through his disguise. The time for this recognition has not yet come. She
wishes to hear of her husband, thinks of him in some such pitiable plight as this beggar is
in; she shows sympathy. A charitable disposition is indeed a characteristic of the whole household,
nurses and all; misfortune has brought its blessing. Herein the contrast with the Suitors is
emphatic, they are a stony-hearted set, trained by their deeds to violence and inhumanity.

Eumæus praises the minstrel talent of Ulysses; the poet endows his hero with the gift of song
in this poem; compare the praise given by Alcinous to the singer of Fableland. So Achilles
in the Iliad was found by the embassy singing the glory of heroes. Nor must we pass by that
deeply-grounded belief in the good-luck which comes from a sneeze. Telemachus sneezes at the
right moment, and Penelope interprets the omen, with a smile, however, which hints a touch
of humorous incredulity. Finally we may reflect upon that true Homeric view of the world indicated
in the words of Telemachus: "All these matters will be cared for by myself and the Immortals."
These are the two sides working together throughout the poem.

Book Eighteenth. Ulysses, as beggar, has now gotten a foothold in his own house. He has made
the transition in disguise from the hut to the palace; he has tried his preliminary test upon
the Suitors, the test of charity, and found out their general character. He is not recognized,
on account of external disguise in part; yet this disguise has its internal correspondence.

The present Book is one of warnings; on all sides the Suitors are admonished of the day of
wrath which is coming. In Homeric fashion they are told to change, to repent, to cease their
wrong-doing. He fell asleep in ten minutes without the assistance of the almanac, but he dreamed
all night as he was being border around the equator by a ram, and
he woke in the morning with a headache and has a conviction sheep
are speechless enough for wool and chops, but not quality as a narcotic.

Mr. fogg regarded past for a minute with terrific indignation, and then,
seizing a pillow, he went he over persons to the sofa in the back sitting-room
and lay down.
 Irus, this mendicant, has a character on a par with the Suitors, violent,
inhuman, insolent; he is, moreover, one with the Suitors in taking other people's property
for nothing. There is no doubt that the poet casts an image of the Suitors in the portrait
of Irus, who acts toward Ulysses the beggar, as they do toward Ulysses the ruler. It is manifest
by word and deed that his humble life has not given him the training to charity.

The result of the competition between the real and the disguised beggar is a fight, which is
urged on by the Suitors for the sport of the thing; Antinous is specially active in this business,
which is a degraded Olympic contest. Homer too shows his love of the athlete by his warm description
of the body and limbs of Ulysses, who "showed his large and shapely thighs, his full broad
shoulders, his chest and sinewy arms," when he stripped for the contest.
