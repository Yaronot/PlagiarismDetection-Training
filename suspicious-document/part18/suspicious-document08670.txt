A fierce wind, blowing from the south, fairly wafts me along the last eleven miles of the Tokaido,
from Totsuka to Yokohama. The wind, indeed, has been generally favorable since the rain-storm
at Okabe, but it fairly whistles this morning. It calls to mind the Kansas wheelman, who claimed
to have once spread his coat-tails to the breeze and coasted from Lawrence to Kansas City in
three hours. Unfortunately I am wearing a coat the pattern of which does not admit of using
the tails for sails otherwise the homestretch of the tour around the world might have provided
one of the most unique incidents of the many I have encountered on the journey.

A battery of field-artillery, the smartest seen since leaving Germany, is encountered in the
streets of Kanagawa, at which point the road to Yokohama branches off from the Tokaido. The
great Imperial highway, along which I have travelled from the old capital almost to the new,
continues on to the latter, seventeen miles farther. Since the completion of the railway between
Tokio and Kanagawa, travellers journeying from the capital down the Tokaido usually ride on
the train to Kanagawa, so that the jinrikisha journey proper nowadays commences at the latter city.

Kanagawa is practically a suburban part of Yokohama: one Japanese-owned clock observed here
points to the hour of eight, another to eleven, and a third to half past-nine, but the clock
at the Club Hotel, on the Yokohama bund, is owned by an Englishman, and is just about striking
ten, when the last vault from the saddle of the bicycle that has carried me through so many
countries is made. And so the bicycle part of the tour around the world, which was begun April
22, 1884, at San Francisco, California, ends December 17, 1886, at Yokohama.

At this port I board the Pacific mail steamer City of Peking, which in seventeen days lands
me in San Francisco. Of the enthusiastic reception accorded me by the San Francisco Bicycle
Club, the Bay City Wheelmen, and by various clubs throughout the United States, the daily press
of the time contains ample record. Here, I beg leave to hope that the courtesies then so warmly
extended may find an echoing response in this long record of the adventures that had their
beginning and ending at the Golden Gate.
