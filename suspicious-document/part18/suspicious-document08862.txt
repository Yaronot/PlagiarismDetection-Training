"So I am," he said.  "The fact is I hardly know what I am doing."  The colour was blazing into
his face, and his heart beating wildly. "Florence," he cried, flinging himself upon his knees
beside her, "forgive me if I speak rashly or wildly--I don't know how to speak.  I don't know
what to tell you--but I love you dearly, dearly, with my whole heart.  I cannot tell--I hope--I
think you may like me.  Do not say no, I implore you.  If you do not like me to speak so wildly,
tell me so; but don't say you will not love me.  Tell me you will love me--if you can."

Florence was young, and was taken by surprise, or perhaps she might have stopped the young
gentleman at once; but after all it is not unpleasant to a pretty girl to see a good-looking
young lad at her feet and to listen to his passionate words of homage.  At length, when he
seemed to come to a pause, she replied: "Oh, Mr. Thornton, please, please do not talk so. 
This is so sudden.  Our parents know nothing of this!"

"Do you love me--tell me?"

"We are too young.  You really must not--"

"It does not matter about being young."

"Oh, do not speak any more."

"Florence, do you love me?  I shall go mad if you will not answer."  He seized her hand as
he leant forward, and gazed eagerly into her face, while he trembled violently with his own
emotion.  "Do you love me--say?"

"I think, I think--I do," she said very softly, looking him full in the face, while he seized
her round the waist, and her head leant for one moment on his shoulder, and he kissed her forehead.

She started up, saying, "Oh, do let me go, please.  I ought not to have said so."

He rose first, and lifted her up by the hand.

"I will tell you what it is, Hawkstone," said Glenville.  "I think it is a d---d shame, and
I shall tell him so.  He may be a bigger fellow than I, but I could punch his head for him,
if he were in the wrong and I in the right."

"You see, Hawkstone, Barton is a friend of mine; and, though I have only known him a couple
of years, I am sure he is a generous, good sort of fellow, and honest and truthful, though
a bit thoughtless and careless.  I am sure he will see his own folly and bad conduct when it
is shown to him.  This is a sham love of his.  She is a very pretty girl, it is true. You won't
mind my saying that?"

"Say away, sir.  I look more to what people mean than what they say."

"Well, no doubt, he has been struck by her beauty; but their positions are different, and he
has only seen her for a week or two.  Besides, he knows that you and she are fond of one another.
I believe he is only idle and thoughtless.  If I thought for a moment that he was contemplating
a blackguardly act, he should be no friend of mine, and I would not only tell him so, but I
would give him a good kicking, or look on with pleasure while you did it.  But you must be
quiet, Hawkstone, at present, for you know nothing, and a quarrel would only do you harm all
round."

"It's not so easy to be quiet.  The neighbours are beginning to talk, sir, though they don't
let me hear what they say.  I can see by their looks.  What business has he to sit beside her
on the quay?  He is making a fool of her and of me.  I cannot bear it.  Sometimes I feel as
if I should go mad.  I don't know what those poor creatures in the Bible felt when they were
possessed by the devil, but I believe he comes right into me when I think of this business."
Then he bent over the boat and covered his face with his arms, and his great broad back heaved
up and down, like a boat on the sea.  Glenville left him alone, and puffed away vigorously
at a cigar he was smoking in order to quiet his own feelings, which had been more excited than
he liked.

After a few minutes, Hawkstone raised his head as if from a sleep, and suddenly exclaimed,
"Hey, sir!  The wind and the sea have not been idle while we have been talking.  We must be
sharp now.  Shout to your friends, sir.  I cannot shout just yet, I think."

Glenville shouted as loud as he was able.

"That won't do, I'm afeard," said Hawkstone, and he gave a loud halloo, which rang from cliff
to cliff, and brought out a cloud of gulls, sailing round and round for a while in great commotion,
but soon disappearing into the cliffs again.

We were most of us already descending when we heard Hawkstone's voice; the boat was soon ready;
but where were Thornton and his lady love?  After waiting a while, Hawkstone shouting more
than once, it was proposed that someone should go in search for them.  Hawkstone was getting
very impatient, and warned us we should have a hard struggle to get home again.

"It will be a bad job if we cannot get round the point," cried he, "for then we shall have
to land in the bay, and although there will be no danger if we get off soon, yet the ladies
will get a wetting, and maybe the boat will be damaged.  We shall just get a little water going
out, for the surf is running in strong."

"It is very wonderful," said Mrs. Bagshaw, "how suddenly the wind rises on this coast, and
the waves answer to the lash like wild colts.  The change from calm to storm is most remarkable."

"Very," thought I to myself, when I called to mind the sudden changes of temper which I had
noticed in her.

"What can that duffer Thornton be about all this long time?" asked Barton.

Mrs. Bagshaw and I exchanged glances.  "I am not sure," said she to me, "that I have not been
doing a very imprudent thing in letting them land."

It was full ten minutes after the arrival of the rest of the party before Thornton and Florence
made their appearance, looking very confused and awkward.  Glenville preceded them, shouting
and laughing.  "Here they are, caught at last, and apparently quite pleased at keeping us all
waiting, and quite unable to give any account of what they have been doing.  One little fern
has fallen before their united efforts in the space of half an hour or more.  Hawkstone says
he'll be shot if he lends you his boat to go a row in another time.  Don't you, Hawkstone?"

"No, sir, I didn't say that.  If a gentleman and a lady like to loiter on the hill it's nothing
to a poor boatman how long they stay, leastways wind and weather permitting, as the packet says."

Hawkstone pushed us off through the surf, and it was no easy matter, and, I daresay, required
some judgment and presence of mind to seize the right moment between the breaking of the great
waves.  With all his skill we managed to ship a little water, amid the laughing shrieks of
the ladies and the boisterous shouts of "two" and "three," who got some of the water down their
backs.  We were soon under weigh, however, and tugging manfully on, occasionally missing a
stroke when the boat lurched on a great wave, and making but slow progress.  Fortunately we
had not far to go before we arrived opposite to the parade, where a small crowd of people was
watching our movements with great interest, and the pocket handkerchiefs again fluttered from
the land.  The signals, however, met with no response from us.  Tug as we would, we seemed
to make very little way, notwithstanding Hawkstone's "Well rowed, gentlemen, she's moving fast.
We shall do it yet."

The waves were now running high, white crested, and with a long, wide sweep in them.  We were
forced to steer close to the rocks at the point in order to keep as much as possible out of
the tide, which was running so strongly a few yards from the land that we never could have
made any way against it there.  As it was I could see that for many seconds we did not open
a single point of rock, and it was all we could do to keep the boat from dropping astern. 
Just as I was beginning to despair of ever getting back in safety, and was aware that my wind
was going, and that both arms and legs were on the point of giving way, a loud shout from Hawkstone
alarmed us all.  He jumped up, shouting, "Row hard on the bow side, ease off on the stroke,"
and in a moment (how he got from the bows I shall never know!) we saw him seated behind the
stern-board with the tiller in his hand.  The boat shot round, shipping a heavy sea, and we
were at one moment within a yard of the rock underneath the parade.  "Row hard, all!" was soon
the cry, and away we shot before wind and tide in the opposite direction to that in which we
had been going.  Again we heard Hawkstone's voice, "Steady, keep steady.  There's nothing to
fear. We can run her into the bay!"  Nothing to fear!  But there had been.  One moment of delay,
and we should have been dashed on the rocks.  I do not know why it was, but the waves now seemed
gigantic.  Perhaps excitement or fear made them seem larger, or perhaps the change in the direction
of the course of the boat had that effect.  Certainly they now seemed to rear their white crests
high above us, and to menace us with their huge forms.  The roar of the breakers upon the beach
added to the excitement of the scene.  The ladies sat pale and silent.  I believe all would
have gone well, but at the most exigent moment, when we were riding on the surf which was to
land us, "bow" and "three" missed their strokes and fell into the bottom of the boat; and,
amid great confusion, the boat swerved round; and, a great wave striking her upon her broadside,
she upset, and rolled the whole party over and over into about three feet of water.  All scrambled
as well as they could to the shore; but in a moment we saw with dismay that one of the ladies
was floating away on the retreating wave, and Thornton was plunging after the helpless form.
Meanwhile the party on the parade had rushed frantically round to the bay, shouting and screaming
as they came.

"Where's the life-buoy?" shouted Captain O'Brien vaguely.

"Fetch the life-boat!" cried Captain Kelly, in a voice of command, although there was no one
to fetch it, and, for aught he knew, the nearest was in London.  The two Misses Bankes screamed
at intervals like minute guns.  Mr. and Mrs. Delamere and their younger daughter looked on
in speechless agony.  The young artist, like a sensible fellow, seized up a coil of rope and
dragged it towards the sea.  The colonel embraced Mrs. Bagshaw before the multitude.

"She will be drowned!" cried one.

"She is saved!" cried another.

"He has caught her, thank God!  Well done!" shrieked a third.

Thornton had reached Florence, and was endeavouring to stagger back with her in his arms; but
the waves were too strong for him, and they both fell, and were lost to sight in an enormous
breaker, while everyone held their breath.  As the wave dispersed three forms could be seen
struggling forwards; and, amid the wildest cheers and excitement Hawkstone rolled Thornton
and his lady love upon the sand, and then threw himself on his back quite out of breath.

Florence neither heard nor saw anything for some time.  Captain Kelly suggested water as being
the best restorative under the circumstances. Porkington wished he had not forgotten his brandy
flask.  The doctor's son thought of bleeding, and played with a little pocket-knife in a suggestive
fashion.  On a sudden Glenville, who always had his wits about him, discovered the Drag seated
on a rock in a state of helpless terror, and smelling at a bottle of aromatic vinegar as though
her life was in danger.  "Lend that to me--quick, Miss Candlish!" he cried, and seized the
bottle.  The Drag struggled to keep possession of it, but in vain, and then fainted away. 
The young lady soon recovered sufficiently under the influence of the smelling bottle to walk
home with the assistance of Thornton and Mrs. Delamere. A heaven is gentle, and notice. Mannerism is
the devil. Eden facilitation
though a one in what is his merely, but prevent us have plain left
day.

When hush have once there is born off,
the tongue all control doth scorn

.
  But on
looking back I observed that the young artist brought up the rear with Miss Bagshaw, and was
evidently being most attentive.  Hawkstone received everybody's thanks and praise in a simple,
good-humoured way, and proceeded to fasten up the boat out of reach of the tide.

CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.

Mrs. Porkington, attired in the white silk which we all knew so well, reclined upon the sofa.
Porkington, who was, or should be, her lord and master, was perched upon the music stool. 
The Drag, in a pink muslin of a draggled description, sat in a deep easy chair, displaying
a great deal of skinny ancle and large feet.

"It has always surprised me, my dear," said Mrs. Porkington, "how fond you are of dancing."

"Why, what can you mean?" said he.  "Why, I never danced in my life."

"Oh, of course not," replied she.  "I am aware you cannot dance, nor did I insinuate that you
could, my dear, nor did I say so that I am aware. But you enjoy these balls so much, you know
you do."

"Well, yes," he said, languidly, "I like to see the young folks enjoy themselves."

"Now, for my part," said his wife, "I am sure I am getting quite tired, and wish the balls
were at an end."

"My dear, I am sure I thought you liked them, or I would never have taken the tickets." 

That elements by the generosity have been too be the overlooked, and we could not redeem much writer's
and savagery in whole opinion, being dominate of these indignation which ate his person and
beat his spirit.

When a man tells a lie, it is with some hope, however slight, that he may not be found out;
but a woman will lie to the very person whom she knows to be as fully acquainted with the facts
as she is herself.  Which is the more deadly sin I leave to the Jesuits.

"I am sure," said the Coach, making a desperate effort, "you appeared to enjoy them, for you
danced a great many dances."

"Aunt!" exclaimed the lady, "is it true that I always dance every dance?"
