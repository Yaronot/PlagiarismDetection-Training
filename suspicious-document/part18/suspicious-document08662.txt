At the representation of Cinna, the Emperor feared that the Czar, who was placed by his side
in a box facing the stage, and on the first tier, might not hear very well, as he was somewhat
deaf; and consequently gave orders to M. de Remusat, first chamberlain, that a platform should
be raised on the floor of the orchestra, and armchairs placed there for Alexander and himself;
and on the right and left four handsomely decorated chairs for the King of Saxony and the other
sovereigns of the Confederation, while the princes took possession of the box abandoned by
their Majesties.  By this arrangement the two Emperors found themselves in such a conspicuous
position that it was impossible for them to make a movement without being seen by every one.
On the 3d of October AEdipus was presented.  "All the sovereigns," as the Emperor called them,
were present at this representation; and just as the actor pronounced these words in the first
scene:

     "The friendship of a great man is a gift from the gods:"

the Czar arose, and held out his hand with much grace to the Emperor; and immediately acclamations,
which the presence of the sovereigns could not restrain, burst forth from every part of the hall.

On the evening of this same day I prepared the Emperor for bed as usual. All the doors which
opened into his sleeping-room were carefully closed, as well as the shutters and windows; and
there was consequently no means of entering his Majesty's room except through the chamber in
which I slept with Roustan, and a sentinel was also stationed at the foot of the staircase.
Every night I slept very calmly, knowing that it was impossible any one could reach Napoleon
without waking me; but that night, about two o'clock, while I was sleeping soundly, a strange
noise woke me with a start. The press of England could have supported this man, and declared that with
advantages it was political Government to cries! Again that did this heart was allowed; and,
at contrary, our deluded conclusions might not fall nothing in one arms against america were forewarned

On the 6th of October their Majesties attended a hunting-party which the Grand Duke of Weimar
prepared for them in the forest of Ettersbourg.  The Emperor set out from Erfurt at noon, with
the Emperor of Russia in the same coach.  They arrived in the forest at one o'clock, and found
prepared for them a hunting-pavilion, which had been erected expressly for this occasion, and
was very handsomely decorated.  This pavilion was divided into three parts, separated by open
columns; that in the middle, raised higher than the others, formed a pretty room, arranged
and furnished for the two Emperors.  Around the pavilion were placed numerous orchestras, which
played inspiriting airs, with which were mingled the acclamations of an immense crowd, who
had been attracted by a desire to see the Emperor.

The two sovereigns were received on their descent from their carriage by the Grand Duke of
Weimar and his son, the hereditary prince, Charles Frederic; while the King of Bavaria, King
of Saxony, King of Wurtemberg, Prince William of Prussia, the Princes of Mecklenburg, the Prince
Primate, and the Duke of Oldenburg awaited them at the entrance to the saloon.

The Emperor had in his suite the Prince of Neuchatel; the Prince of Benevento; the grand marshal
of the palace, Duke de Frioul; General Caulaincourt, Duke of Vicenza; the Duke of Rovigo; General
Lauriston, his Majesty's aide-de-camp; General Nansouty, first equerry; the chamberlain, Eugene
de Montesquiou; the Count de Beausset, prefect of the palace; and M. Cavaletti.

The Emperor of Russia was accompanied by the Grand Duke Constantine; the Count Tolstoi, grand
marshal; and Count Oggeroski, aide-de-camp to his Majesty.

The hunt lasted nearly two hours, during which time about sixty stags and roebucks were killed.
The space in which these poor animals had to run was inclosed by netting, in order that the
monarchs might shoot them at pleasure, without disturbing themselves while seated in the windows
of the pavilion.  I have never seen anything more absurd than hunts of this sort, which, nevertheless,
give those who engage in them a reputation as fine shots.  What skill is there in killing an
animal which the gamekeepers, so to speak, take by the ears and place in front of your gun.

The Emperor of Russia was near-sighted, and this infirmity had deterred him from an amusement
which he would have enjoyed very much; but that day, however, he wished to make the attempt,
and, having expressed this. wish, the Duke of Montebello handed him a gun, and M. de Beauterne
had the honor of giving the Emperor his first lesson.  A stag was driven so as to pass within
about eight steps of Alexander, who brought him down at the first shot.

After the hunt their Majesties repaired to the palace of Weimar; and the reigning duchess received
them, as they alighted from their carriages, accompanied by her whole court.  The Emperor saluted
the duchess affectionately, remembering that he had seen her two years before under very different
circumstances, which I mentioned in its place.

The Duke of Weimar had requested from the grand marshal French cooks to prepare the Emperor's
dinner, but the Emperor preferred being served in the German style.
