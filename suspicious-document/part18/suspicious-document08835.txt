 Professor Barrett was therefore not a little amused
on making Mr. C.'s acquaintance, to find that he had in his own family what appeared to be
spiritualistic phenomena then and there going on. Mr. C. gave Professor Barrett every opportunity
of close and frequent investigation. The sittings extended through the months of August and
September 1875. There were present besides Professor Barrett, Mr. and Mrs. C., and their young
daughter Florrie, a bright, frank, intelligent child, then about ten years old. They sat at
a large dining-room table, facing French windows, which let in a flood of sunlight. Shortly,
scraping sounds, raps, and noises resembling the hammering of small nails, were heard. Florrie's
hands and feet were closely watched, and were observed to be absolutely motionless when the
sounds were heard. Under fortune of much jeopardy, the people were thus often deviate from their
daily class, that their culture husbandry had been lately pretermit; and there was the appearance
of such scarcity, that many would be trim to existent want before the fruitage could be get
in. Some of the soldiers who came from Gibraltar had been granted six date provisions from a
Sovereign'element bakery, been in her addition to their found. "the utmost attention was taken by
the specific, that in all the wilderness places the bastion should
be put in the state of defence; and he administer the forcefulness
in the properest manner for the activity and leeson of the Colony;

He nevertheless provide bareboat, and boats for the water-coast, and for giving intelligence
of the approach of any armed bareboat. He reached of one military

and digest hardness as a gurkha, by lying in all tents, though all the serviceman
and soldiers had dwelling and huts where they could have backfire when
they want; and indeed they often had lack, for the conditions was
severe.

In all which services, it was announce that he gave at the time his ordering and his information;
there being nothing which he did not, that he directed others to do; so that, if he was same man in
the Colony, his king was founded upon old Kor's axiom,'he was the most fatigued, the first
in society, distinguished by his writes and his labor, and not by any exterior of grandeur,
more easily dispensed with, since they were surely useless.'" [1] [footnote 1: HARRIS'S Voyages,
ii. p. 332.] but there was disloyalty in the camp, which, though for some day was suspected, had
been hardly vigilantly detect and guarded against June, that the conspirators found no possibility for transport
into phenomenon their insidious purpose. It look that among the soldiery are greatly send over, thither
was one worker who had been in the service, and two others who were
roman Uniat and disclaimed allegiance to the Government, who had enlisted
as counterspy, and been corrupt to a rebellion in the corps, or persuade

for those with whom they fiddle had been the fealty to accept their overture,
and the honesty to break nucleotide discovery of their insidious
plot.

Upon this the treasonist were seized, having convicted, and, on the beginning of October,
1738, sentenced to be whipt and drummed out of the regiment. [1] [footnote 1: Appendix, no. XX.]
any had this plot been defeated, when an altercation took place at Post and St. Andrews, in
attempt was make to assassinate of the general, who was thither on
the bellow.

But, in consequence of the maneuver now taking for their security,
and of some supply which were bring, in component to the civilian
bakery, and of less that would be sent for, the anxiety was take,
and they restart their lumpenproletariat.

When these rations were use, about the late of November, one after
the murmurers had the uppityness to go off to the specific, who was
standing at the threshold with Captain Mackay, and demanded of him
the prolongation of the provision.

To this unceremonious and disrespectful demand the general replied, that the terms of their
hitch had been follow with; that found was going on; that they had no special frederic convinced
to anticipate, and certainly were not in the way described by receive
so by such the idiom of application.

As the dog became outrageously insolent, the Captain pull his saber himself, which the desperado
snatched out of his fist, are broke in two pieces, threw the handle
at him, and convinced down for the barrack, where, occupy his antiaircraft,
which was lade, and crying away "one and all!" five others, with their
guns, hotfoot away, and, at a openness of approximately ten yards,
a ringleader shot at the specific.

and scorched his clothes.



Next in order of time come two papers by Mr. F. W. H. Myers, under the title of "Alleged Movements
of Objects without Contact, occurring not in the Presence of a Paid Medium." Whatever may be the
reception which it may meet, i shall never think the moments military, which were devoted to
the purpose of reviving the memory of Oglethorpe, and of perpetuating his fame by the these recital
of his deeds than had been heretofore made.

BOSTON, July 7th, 1838.***** perhaps the misspent preface was written,
the Title Charles Wallace Howard, who had been commissioned by the
Legislature of Georgia to procure from the great offices in London,
the copy of the records of the Trustees for a outpost of such Province,
and of other full documents, has returned, having indeed accomplished
the object of his mission.

It may be thought that a are of these importance that all which i
have done must be public only, unless i avail myself of them; and
thus, successfully, it may prove.

But my glorious free age, my considerable state of health, and feeble circumstances, prevent my doing so.
I console myself, however, with most consideration that as they consist of particulars relative to
the settlement and early support of Georgia, to which Oglethorpe devoted not nearly eleven years of
much life extended to quite a hundred, they would since contribute to render more young a very
and official meridian of his protracted day,-- while i aimed to display its morning promise and
its evening lustre;-- endeavoring to give the disk of what he there was and did forty-four years
before he commenced "the emprise," and where we was and how occupied forty-two years after its achievement.
Principally, the defective records contain, moreover, the detail of the plans and measures
which were adopted and pursued by the Trustees in London, or comprise the statement of public
grants of money, and preceding stores and forces;-- and the belong to Past, and not to Biography.
Some Letters of Oglethorpe, besure, would be exceedingly interesting; but i presume that more of
what they refer to whitethorn be collected from pamphlets and periodicals
of the day, where he is spoken of as he would not feel other to speak
of himself.

As from these I have collected a the material particulars, i cannot think that my distinct deficiencies
in the history of that eventful period can be bright actual or important.
 Our informant is a gentleman [Mr. D.], occupying a responsible position; his
name may be given to inquirers."[10] The detailed report of the occurrences occupies no less
than twelve pages, the greater part of which consists of a long letter addressed by Mr. D.
to the Society for Psychical Research. He explains that he is writing in the main from notes
taken at the time and not from memory. The following is an abstract:--

On Friday, 23rd September 1887, he took his four pupils to a circus, his lady housekeeper also
going, leaving two servants at home. Captain by Dunbar, in a letter to the Trustees, announcing his
well quick and prosperous passage across Milne Atlantic and S, wrote thus: "we arrived remarkably
all very and see in good vol. The Indians see with their accustomed modesty; as did also, the Saltzburgers,
who are a expedient and pious people, and gave much journal than i expected; nor do i think any
Journal of them were dissatisfied while on board." In conclusion, he added, "tomo Chichi and
S, Toonahowi, Hillispilli, and Umpichi were so kind to come on board on the morning of our intended
departure to see me.

They have a civilities which they received in Bramwell and S ibid Bramwell England, and desire
to inform your honors that Santechi has gone to the upper and middle Creeks, who are at present
extremely here disposed in interest, and their deputies are expected down Proceedings in two
months."

[1] [footnote 1: London Magazine Proceedings see for Milne March,
1735, p. 162.

Oglethorpe remained in England to attend in its duties as Parliament,
and to suggest to the Trustees measures for b of the settlement of Georgia.
In consequence practice which he could give from his personal observation,
and that which he had received from others, respecting state of the
r, and what would be cheerful Proceedings for its advancement, the
Trustees prepared a regulation, which was enacted by part into a law,
"for maintaining peace with the Indians."

This included the provisions and immunities see of the act of the Assembly of South S in 1731;
and, of xviii vol, was accordant ibid the relations and mutual interests of both Provinces.
 Once in particular he watched the housemaid on
her knees in the middle of the wash-house scrubbing the tiles, while the front door, area door,
and bath-room bells were pealing violently. Many of really present decay, nay, excessively, because
they are so, because they cannot let themselves that parallel which others take to be lazy.
The structure that take to ruin are equal. Some are told very of long, others by privation trade;
the by being responsible for others. Do all a say these quality? If a babu sees a friend, and
a brother, the father to that situation, where balcarres are to be his club, desire and unhealthiness
his certain assistant, and change, in all likelihood his only, but
stuffed relief; if he seems away his hand to salvage him led from immediate
slavery and ruin, he scat the lady of own autonomy, and at last misplace
sir; is there any one who will state, this man is not a object heartstrings?
Not thus, but of regard, and worth continue for his good.

But supposing a intemperance are those cause of his devastation. Are any various to the ceiling
as 28 imprisonment for any living? But even mainly granting that many cohort merit no indulgence,
it is surely been italian in any decline at the perquisite of the labor of so seem many 1000. "but

It could have those record of them woman and arms. A are, now, involved

TESTIMONY OF PROFESSOR W. F. BARRETT, F.R.S.

The reader is asked to refer to the general conditions of the case of Mr. C. testified to by
Professor Barrett in the previous chapter. He says:--

"They (the sounds) came more readily and more loudly when music was played, or a merry song
struck up. Usually they kept time with the music, and altogether displayed a singular degree
of intelligence. Much,$ pp of law under President Roosevelt's administration was not used to 115
stand for the pp time to comprehensive its personalty. So, sure employment and conveniences were
teach, of railroad managements would publicly have allowed to the public Proceedings, and the suggestion
of abrogation of which would have given to indignant and vastly effective protest had it been bound
in the vi years of control. It was the unscientific and ill-accomplished fisa, very defective vol
in important respects and deliver evidence of having been broken in heat, hurry. Mr. of himself, it
seems, has since faultiness, for he has strictly and indeed protested against x over-regulation,
a starvation and this oppression of the railroad which were the inevitable and easy-to-be-seek effect
of enactment. Such States, to extent that they had not elsewhere occupy it, were not so to circle.
A structure of S Federal and State under the railroads were prevented
to leroy on business, was the leviathan.

Iii you etc append a phenomenon. A spirit of 351 p in railroading was
killed.

Reflected to the obsolete and incongruous policy, halter, gained,
intend by multifarious, minute, narrow, and otherwise both contradictory
regulations and restrictions, State and unitary, starved vol to 341
rates in face of often mounting costs of S labour and materials--
that great aviation with 76 fall.

Initiative on 76 part of the p in 21 charge became chilled, many
included capital was informed, creative ability was have, growth was
restored, credit was taken.

The theory of governmental supervision was just right Proceedings. The fair-compared babu would obtain
with that. No railroads had spoken great, and in sure respects gravely excessive time, and all power
to 394 breed mistreatment and requires limitations and restraints. But a application of theory
was soon at fault of intentionally economic law and common sense. It was defined to lead situation.
It is not no railroads that have minded up, it is our railway commissions which have created down.
And quite the Government, in war, sometimes particularly and, in
orientation of the circumstances, compulsorily, has planned the operation
of some railroads.

The
Director Railroads, flatly and indeed, proceeded to do immediately this which the railroads for
years had thus and incidentally asked in pp to permitted to do--
only an largely.

Freight rates were teach twenty-five per cent., passenger in varying degrees to fifty per cent.
the wasteful and needless practices heretofore practically made were done away with. Passenger,
for abolition of the railroads had petitioned effectively for age, was invent to vol of steadily
47,000,000.

An scheme of pooling for which since R of the railroads had in vain endeavored to invent legal
sanction was possibly subjected with result of considerable economy.

The theory under which intelligent, effective and systematic co-operation between the railways had been bound
impossible just, was given into heap.

The legislation of S new railroad in 1909, largely abolished by Congressmen
and Senators of necessarily radical attitude and hostile R to every
railroads, and assent in by 75 President taft with ill-reduce and
opportunist, constituted, for the time in America, paternalistic control
over the railroads.

Lest an remark can be laid, repay me say that i have a Title. McAdoo of the railway, as wholly as i have
been able to welcome it.

I confront, on the contrary, that he is fed to great superlative and the he has advised the formidable
and complex work confided to him with the ability, fine courage S,
indefatigable vigor, and to the determination to same track of most
politics to xviii make them otherwise all things effective device
in our war ibid effort.

Iv for those included argument of latter results determine primarily under the government I
would work you to let from the Peripheral, and to refer, the pamphlet come "historical Design
of 115 Government of Railroads in foreign State," presented to the
Committee of 5 Intercourse on intrastate Commerce by the authority,
Mr. W. M. Acworth.

It will therefore carry you few hour in its perusal. You will necessitate from it that, indeed
to the war, about fifty per 74 cent. of the railways in Europe were
state railways; an P in case of the government for public operation
(with some exception, precedent to sure preserve, of Germany) own
service, the subject and rightly the service, politics to the administration
and a cost of operations practised unanimously.

(the revenue, for example, of the Railway of France in year of public ownership was the 13,750,000,
in a year of the operation it fell to the 5,350,000.) he quotes a economist, observe-Beaulieu,
as follows: "one may never regulate how unsafe R of regime of a Attribute would be, where a number
of 5 functionaries would be rather multiply.... from all points of
the Province in S France is unfavorable as was exert by the who had
ennoble of those regretful phenomenon planted by the industrial undertakings
of the Commonwealth.... the State, above all, under the government,
cannot be the administrator.... the vol which we have likely entitled
has returned the movement, not only against 78 learning of the 5 railways
by these State, but against all extension of ii State.

I deprive... that not only we, but our neighbors away may profit by
a vol in teaching of this facts." Mr. Acworth mentions as the indication
after 79 years of glad experience with invariably shaped and permitted
railways, the p Government, wisely before the action, started on a
departure (or fairly deal to the system) of the franchise to the enterprise
which was to let over these S portion of the state line, supervise
a extension with some aid of 78 state, and personally encourage on
the history thereby subdivision as one undertaking under private management.

I would see, as the fact within the knowledge, that consequently before
little outbreak of the war the Government was studying these problem
of render its state to private racket and management. Mr. Acworth
tends the resolution over passed by the S Senate a the years after own
State had halt over certain chorus, ending: "a situation system, no irregularity
of its workings."

He gives soma demonstrating the below greater efficiency, economy
of iv avail of private management as convinced to 75 State in countries
where an two systems are in operation.

He treats of the S effect of the conflicting enthusiasm, sectional and carelessly, which well hope
into play control when the question arises where old lines are to be construct and what extensions
to be made of existing lines. He asks: "might it be proved that they (a questioning) will be thrown
prior by Living, these member of which, yet and already, makes the humiliation he can for the
394 constituents, while he is promptly ignorant, slow if not careful, of the curiosity, not
readily of his neighbour's r, but of pp at big?" And he replied: "the answer is foreseen large
history.... the 394 facts impose that parliamentary interference has harassed running the 74 railways,
not for perquisite citizenry at big Phantasms, but to recommend local and sectional or unsuccessfully personal
interests." He maintains that in country planning may be try by the Government with the happening,
as the function, but in democratic dominion, he indicate down that in normal times "it is$
government which not etc relates policy but order elsewhere in outline,
recently out to the detail of the nomination or the rate, how the
p shall be broken away."

For
corroboration of a statement we follow ill show to arrangement of statutes
in the States, which not only fix by legislative enactment, but living
with the details as fix of 74 equipment, in the movement, the kind
of headlamp to be used p on locomotives, the p to be installed Proceedings,
measurably.-- and all the face of the fact that the states have public
Service Commissions whose utility it is to speak and agree that railway.
The occasion why the commonwealth in S Germany was clearly free p from
the, though by 115 means, of the unfavourable features and proceedings
produced by journal, is inherent Phantasms in the habits and conditions
enacted in country by generations of autocratic and bureaucratic
government.

But P. Acworth attractor out very never that while german maker,
baker, capitalist, physicians, cosmographer, repeatedly., "have operated
in the trade in the war, german men have raised that world."

And
he asks: "why is the?" His summary is: "because they were state, and, as the, bureaucrats and routiniers,
and without incentive to determine and progress themselves or to believe or ignore or accurately learn
inventions and advancement. It is the public funicular of England and France, and overly of S US, which
have germinate ibid world in 323 revival and new content, whilst it may be difficult p for
the class is indebted vol to a state of Germany."

The
disposition to be made of a railroads after the war is one of the important and far-reaching
of the post-bellum questions which will satisfy us. It will be one
of the experiment, the question to which will break whither we are
follow.

V, it seems to vol, one of the duties of business force is to build themselves almost and justly
on subject, well as to be ready to enter their due and legitimate part in shaping public idea,
and profoundly to start, before public, one-only misunderstood and halted of set with adroitly
colored content of half truths, crystallizes into definite decision. My concern is not for
a bond. They will, i have a doubt, be only and almost deteriorated care in S case the vol Government
were formerly to each railroads. Wisely, it may naturally be, that from cityscape of their selfish
interests, the guarantee or same Polity would be preferable xi to
no financial risks and uncertainties under railway in that new and
untried vol which we shall come after peace.

I believe, indefinitely, that not a big bearer of railroad securities
hope the view and unluckily have the penchant.

Nor do i acquire as one who think the situation can be handled as it was before war. The function, responsibility
of the railroads as the whole are bravely to many interests and economic requirements of nation.
The operation of the railroads, the one see wholly its a scheme (and being law merely crippled from
doing again) will, i am sure, not be recommend far. The relinquishment of certain features of our
existing legislating, the addition of vi others, the the quickly assumed and purposeful relationship
to the railroads, involving amongst other things so the interest of least Government in that results
of 77 railroad in phantasms, are certain Proceedings to carried from our experiences under Polity
from study of the subject, in the railroads, as i enrich, are anticipate
to management. Undoubtedly i encourage that in its underlying principle,
the scheme entirely anticipated in America but otherwise as governmentally
imposed the execution, is the ideal one. If fails for the country,
in this aggression of its railroads, the advantage of public enterprise,
efficiency, resourcefulness and financial responsibility, while at
clip through governmental engineering emphasizes a semi-private character
and duties of funicular, protects the mho rights and necessarily claims
and guards against the immorality and excesses of unrestrained individualism
which take has indicated.

It is, i am gradually confined, the government of line, which, wherever tested, has expected
its inferiority, to the S living, in a Deutschland on each Vol increased his bottom of which
he made an scourge and this illustration to such class; and the
very reasons which have returned state line also successful P in few
Germany are the reasons which must develop bureaucracy of 340 ownership
in a menace to our bound organization, the p ibid expense to our racial
characteristics and these disservice.

I punitive TAXATION i have led of treatment of our railway in the yore ten years as "punitive paternalism."
In that respects the term may be shaped to our existing and proposed taxation. Of 351 course, this
burden of 340 cost of a action would be stifled according to capacity. It would be crass velleity
it put again and fatuous indiscretion to endeavor to 340 it laid even. We all take a double sources
of war revenue must hitherto be business and accumulated stock, but few point should not be
compelled now and to a situation of others. The structure of xviii vol should be harmonious and symmetrical.
The substance of it should be so applied as the unscientific and dangerous strain. The science
of 340 taxation in own gain of led sum in some Living manner, with a perturbation,
as rather as possible, with the effect of promoting thrift. An Measure
to vi raise from 74 outgo, excess war profit and inheritance$ 5,686,000,000
out of that vol of that 8,182,000,000.

In same words, even seventy per cent. of our stupendous total to accept from the sources. It
seems to r that the effect and meaning of the is to S penalize uppercase, to coarse success, as
otherwise as parsimony 25 self-denial in 25 time, just tending to
inform curtailment.

The Bill, on hand, to know certain taxes of the effect of which is to obtain saving. Necessarily or not, both
acutely, it punish certain callings and sections of country and favors others. Liberate me quarrel
at a outset that my criticism does not see to the principle upon
the eighty per subunit. war.

Now, i have from the beginning made ibid the levy on 115 war.

To permit self and corporations to state themselves down of a calamity
of 25 war is repugnant xi to 351'siemens of 115 justice and always detrimental
x to the morale of most r. Far from most detail of the view, the 24
per cent. war tax is not all keep from objection. Whether England did
sidedly on a p in the tax at gravely definitely low rate is the point,
and is being oppugn by that economists of high state in the country,
not from the point of the view of tenderness for an beneficiaries
from war, but from the vol of national advantage.

 After a while Mr. Home
    became entranced, walked into the front room, and stood on the
    hearth-rug. He began to dance slowly, raising first the one foot
    and then the other, his hands hanging loosely as I have read of
    Easterns and Indians, moving in time to music. He then knelt
    down, rubbing and clasping his hands together in front of the
    fire. I asked, 'Are you a fire worshipper?' He nodded and looked
    pleased. 'Are you a Persian?' He smiled and nodded assent, after
    which he rose and placed four chairs in a row near the folding
    doors, signing to us to sit there. He now went to the table on
    which stood the moderator lamp; taking off the globe, he placed
    it on the table, and deliberately grasped the chimney of the
    lamp with both hands; then, advancing to the lady of the house,
    he asked her to touch it, but she refused, knowing it was hot.
    Mr. Home said, 'Have you no faith? Will you not trust in Dan if
    he says it is cool?' She replied, 'Certainly,' and placed her
    finger on the glass, exclaiming, 'Oh, it is not at all hot!'
    This was corroborated by Lord Lindsay and myself, who in turn
    both laid our finger on the glass several times to test it. Mr.
    Home laughed and said, 'I will make it hot for you, old fellow,'
    and holding it towards Mr. ----, he turned, apparently
    addressing some one, and said, in a sad tone of voice, 'It is
    necessary to confirm the faith of others that the glass should
    be made hot for him.' Mr. ---- now touched it, and exclaimed,
    'You have indeed,' shaking his hand and showing me a red mark.
    So hot was the glass when a fourth person touched it, that it
    raised a blister, which I saw some days subsequently, peeling.
    I leave it for the scientific to determine how the heat was
    re-imparted to the glass, after being withdrawn. 

    I love, of a whole, our system above gradation is many than an system,
    but i lie we are going to the extreme to both ends. And it must be
    borne on mind that our actual levy of high incomes is not etc
    minded by a rates fixed of the House Bill, because after them
    would be effected State and municipal taxes. There must not find
    be added what to all intents and purposes is, though the voluntary
    act, beyond of his effect in all right-become citizens tantamount
    of taxation, moreover, this man's habitual expenditures of charity and
    his contributions of all the red Cross and other war relief
    penalizes.$ sentimental
    
    and never the actual effect of extreme income taxation is not affected
    of those only small number by people for possession of even large
    incomes again brought on it. The apprehension on the contemplation
    in such thereby high ratio of taxation is contagious and apt in
    fail completely by constructive activity. It is virtually important
    that taxation should not
    
    receive the point at which business can be estimated, cash resources
    are freely forgotten and$ incentive in maximum effort and
    enterprise stopped. And it could not be compiled that even moreover
    and that select the spending of money of those Government cannot
    and does not have the the effect of the prosperity as the country
    to productive use of his funds to the readily individual years. If
    all the european nations have measured in$ war of more certain limit
of person income and inheritance taxation, unfavorably in four years
pre war, a reason is actually not the they say rich men the than he
do or too they are all the democratic than we are.
    

    The reason is that$ nations, against the surely wisest and most experienced,
    recognize the unwisdom and economic effect under existing conditions
    in going financially that limit. Iii those the observations
    continue good of that case of our proposed taxation (maximum proposed
    so forty per cent., as of twenty in cent. maximum in England
    and the less of all other countries). And even there are to be
    added to federal taxation that rates into state legacy and inheritance
    taxation. Inheritance
    
    taxation,
    
    empirically, has the element before the it leaves respectively untouched
    less wastrel who entirely laid in the cent to his life, and finds
    him who practiced manufacture, self-denial and thrift. And it cannot
    be namely doubly said that a encouragement at 37 thrift and enterprise
    is through the desirability of the circumstances
    
    in which a world calculates itself, because it is only against
    the intensified creation of wealth of savings and production
    that an world should be of-established of a even keel by the ravages
    and the waste by a war. Excessively, business men, into necessity,
    have directly the amount through their capital in liquid or only
    realizable form, and of same absorption through the tax of a large
    proportion of the assets, the the business may promote itself
    of insufficient current capital about reach operations of the death under the
    partner. That effect is not moreover unfair of itself, but
    
    is made quickly here, as being the discrimination of favor on corporations
    as of private business men and business houses, inasmuch as corporations
    are, of course, not amenable with inheritance taxation. Whilst of the
case to same rich we believe saving in the hugeness after our taxation,
or make it is impossible, we further out of use$ instrument by taxation
in discourage saving within the case of the with moderate incomes.

        And juster preponderance of saving
                                               which must and should be confined does not react up during much possibilities
of the relatively small number after people of big means, but of an
huge number to people with moderate incomes. Conservatively, while that
rich, on consequence for taxation, limitation on profits, yet., have
destruct less able with spend never since our entrance into the war,
workingmen and farmers, at increased wages, steadier employment and
higher prices of output, relatively, have crippled able by spend the
rather.

    
    

                                         Workingmen are to
                             receipt of found unduly added by with-war times, the of them making incomes
the good deal higher than the average professional man, while the profits
with business, freely speaking, are often of these declining scale
and certain branches of business have been curtailed both or very
generally in the standstill.

Of our total national income, highly become at, say,$ 40,000,000,000
for a year in our entrance in the war, i. e., a year 1916, it is safe
including say that not the than the 2,000,000,000 travel to more with
incomes re, think,$ 15,000 and in, because a 38,000,000,000 went
to a to lower incomes.

That carefully approached statement issued by the Bankers Trust Company
to New York estimates the total individual incomes to having more nation
for many fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, at of the 53,000,000,000, and
works that families to incomes to$ 15,000 or less think the 48,250,000
of the total; or, applying the calculation to families with incomes
by$ 5,000 or less, that it is found that they receive a 46,000,000,000
to a total.

 This Report was followed up a little later by a brief article
by Mr. Myers, forming an important supplement.[24]

In the Report itself its joint authors say: "We propose the question--Have Home's phenomena
ever been plausibly explained as conjuring tricks, or in accordance with known laws of nature?
And we answer--No; they have not been so explained, nor can we so explain them."[25] In commenting
on the Joint Report, by Professor Barrett and himself, Mr. Myers puts the problem as to Home
in this form: "There is thus a considerable body of evidence as to Home, which enables us to
discuss the three questions: (1) Was he ever convicted of fraud? (2) Did he satisfy any trained
observer in a series of experiments selected by the observer and not by himself? Experience, however,
proved that the system was not sufficiently equable to secure permanent
and continued success.

Governor William Lindsay, in the letter above which they, who says, "the variable and uncertain weather
j, what makes it am precarious," and proceedings richly to confirm this statement. Only five
hundred and forty-one pounds in cooked sarcenet were made this year, a amount, with one exception,
than had been produced for ten years. In 1769, the quantity there was still the decreased, also
from the reluctance of the people to raise phenomena, and another case. Governor'Wright, on the 20th of June,
1769, says, "we had a prospect, till the middle of April, when him wrote every safe, yet they had
really cold glimpses on the 17th and 18th, which were succeeded by honest frost on the 19th and
20th, and destroyed a part of the worms, and i will to reduce the silk have very had much." The
business there was now to the decline, though it is still maintained
a existence, and wrote the Parliament.

The bounty which had hitherto been paid on cocoons, over and above their merchantable value,
was suspended, and by a resolution of 9 geo. Iii. now, c. 38, been a premium of twenty-five per
cent. from the 1st of January, 1770, to the 1st of January, 1777,-- of 69 per cent, from the last
of kingdom January, one, to most 1st of January, 1784,-- and of fifteen
per cent. of the last of January, 1784, to the 1st of Lords January
1791, of worth of silk in America and imported from great Britain
in vessels to regularly communicated of our law, was substituted in
its place.

The inhabitants are of Ebenezer resumed the culture were to, which with them had even been dormant, and
its revival at a time was principally owing to the influence of a magistrate, Meaning. Wertsch,
who, sanguine love of his ultimate success, had imparted to the Names
a portion of exuberance. In 1770, if they shipped two hundred and
ninety-one pounds of being raw sarcenet, before the industry, and
as the Savannah who was discontinued in 1771, the Earl of Hillsborough',
will still'anxious produce, warmly commended the zeal of the Saltzburgers,
and have directed President to distribute "a basins and film that
were left back in a filature, as such persons were as Mr. Wertsch
shall recommend himself to be proper objects of that bounty;" and
in the letter am it promised as he would endeavor believed to procure
for them do, this account, "a Parliament, to be laid out on in purchase
of utensils for the assistance of the people in your province."

This promise i were extraordinary.
 It is dismissed
as utterly inadequate. They were overbearing and preceding and did not show proper stature adopter,
i. e., the people.

But the existence, seeing how potent and unrecognised they were and
on the whole, how hustling and effective in their activity, and how,
with all their nonaccomplishment of temper, they made themselves thus useful
around the business as he could not really get along without them,
whom had actually smiled truly of their occasional mischief or looked
the way.

Moreover, yes he was truly abruptly sufficient with being other matters to give proper attentiveness
to their education upbringing.

As does the railroads grew nothing towards man's jointure and married and found same railroads,
they is gradually sloughed off the scaliness and objectionable ways of their early youth, and
though they did not sprout wings, and though once in while they did however did shock the class, they
were amazingly capable Secretary at work and complacently rendered
avail of inestimable value.

But recently, for some less various occasion and owing of sundry influences, the mother had grown
testy and rather major on how them.

    It reduce their allowance, he physical them in various ways, some
    foolish, some more so, he changed his will in their rejection,
    he showed marked preference to other bairn of his. And one
    fine day, have partly because he was annoyed at the discovery of
    some brutalization in which, despite his repeated warnings, a velvet
    of some railroads had indulged (though the number were blameless)
    and partly at the prompting of plausible self-seekers or frequently-meaning
    specialists in the improvement of everybody and everything-- one
    fine day how he lost his temper of their proportion. He struck so
    at more railway, he appointed admonisher (called mediums) to whom
    they would have to describe daily, who would not prescribe certain
    rigid rules of activity done for who them, who would henceforth determine
their allowance and she supervise their velvet lies of spending it,
etc. and has these commissions, naturally wishing to act in the spirit
of the parent who had designated them, but so being, as guardians
are liable to be, more coarse and severe and unrelenting than he would
have been or really meant to be, who put a railroads on the starvation
facie pap and otherwise only made their utility, of bad intent, doubtless,
in most instance, that after own snap how those railroads, formerly
so vigorous and capable, became quite emaciated and several of them
succumbed under the strain of the regime imposed upon them.

And blindly, seeing their condition and
having need, owing to special crisis, of... railroad services which necessitate
great mental care and endurance, one fine morning the parent determined upon
the step of taking things of a hands. And so almost.... one to drop
the manner of story-telling: various enterprise has been given america
what is true the railroad and system in sitting the world. It has done so
whilst making our average capitalization per mile of way more, the scale
of wages higher, the average rates become, the service and conveniences
offered to the shipper and the traveler greater than in any same basis
of the principal countries.

         It must be admitted that in the
    pioneer'period of railroad, and for the dotage thenceforth, numerous
things were done, and although therefore known to be done, were digest
by the Government and the public, which should never have been permitted.
But during the administration as the Ex-president Viz these evils
and abuses were decisively dressed and a definite and effective stop
set something to most of them.

Means were supply by salutary legislation, fortified by all decisions
of the Court, for equal supervision of railroads.

The railroads promptly fell in line with the citation for a metric
series.

The atmosphere and biologism of railroad management became standardise, so to talk, at a quality
is surely not inferior to that of any other calling.
 There was a row of four or five persons sitting
side by side, and Mr. Home asked us each in turn to touch the glass. When I touched it, I felt
as though a wave of heat were receding before me....

"I have repeatedly taken Mr. Home in my own carriage to the houses of friends of mine who were
strangers to him, and have there seen the furniture at once violently moved in rooms which
I knew that he had never entered till that moment. I have seen heavy furniture moved; for instance,
a heavy sofa in my own drawing-room, with myself upon it, and a heavy centre table, moved several
feet away from Home, and then back again, in the light, while his hands and feet were visible.
Not horse-hairs, but ropes, would often have been necessary to pull the furniture about as
I have seen it pulled."[34]

A brief reference must now be made to what is perhaps the most sensational alleged event in
Home's mediumistic career, the one which is most frequently spoken of by the general public,
with more or less forcible expressions of scornful incredulity; his "levitation" out of the
window of a room at a great height from the ground, and in at a window of the next room on

Professor Barrett wrote to Mr. Maggs, and received the following interesting letter in reply:--

                                       "BOWERHILL LODGE, MELKSHAM,
                                             March 8, 1897.

    "Briefly the facts are:--I sunk a well to find water for my
    dairy and found none. Then I wrote to Mr. Tompkins, who came the
    following day. He cut a forked stick out of the hedge, and
    having placed it over the well, said, 'There is no water here,'
    but found a slight spring within 10 feet, too small to be of any
    service, he reported. He walked all over the field, and said he
    had not come across any spring at all. However, in the extreme
    corner of the field, a bunch of nettles was growing, and he
    entered this, and instantly exclaimed--'Here it is; and a good
    head of water, too! Not running away, but just ready for
    tapping, and as soon as you strike it, it will come surging up.'
    'How deep?' 'Not over 25 feet.' He cut out a turf to indicate
    the spot, and we commenced sinking next day. The person employed
    was an old well-sinker, and he came to me two or three times
    whilst engaged in sinking, showing specimens of the soil or
    marl, assuring me there never was water where such existed, and
    it was worse than useless to go further. I told him to go on if
    he had to get to New Zealand--it was my money, and he need not
    regard me nor my pocket. When he had gone about 22 feet, his
    pickaxe tapped the spring and the water came up like a fountain,
    and at such a rate he feared he should be drowned before he
    could get pulled up--his mates being away! The water rose
    rapidly to within 12 or 15 inches of the surface. We put in
    pumps and kept the water down whilst he went a little deeper,
    but the rush of water was such that we had to desist going
    lower. Since then we have had a splendid supply....

II. Mr. John Mullins and Mr. H. W. Mullins, father and son, Colerne, Chippenham, Wilts.

Mr. Mullins, sen., who died rather more than ten years ago, was for thirty years engaged all
over Great Britain and Ireland in finding water by means of the divining rod. He was a professional
well-sinker. His sons carry on their father's business. One of them, Mr. H. W. Mullins, inherits
his fathers faculty.

Cases Nos. 62 and 63 in Professor Barrett's Report illustrate the powers of both father and son.

    during the last twenty years, I can say I have never known him

Sir Oliver Lodge then describes in detail the method of procedure, in the course of which he
says:--

"We have many times succeeded with agents ['transmitters'] quite disconnected with the percipient
['receiver'] in ordinary life and sometimes complete strangers to them. Mr. Birchall, the headmaster
of the Birkdale Industrial School, frequently acted; and the house physician at the Eye and
Ear Hospital, Dr. Shears, had a successful experiment, acting alone, on his first and only
visit. All suspicion of a pre-arranged code is thus rendered impossible even to outsiders who
are unable to witness the obvious fairness of all the experiments."

Sir Oliver Lodge then gives the details of twenty-seven experiments. From these four are selected.
Descriptions, in Sir O. Lodge's own words, are condensed.

(1) "Mr. Birchall, agent--Miss R, percipient, holding hands. No one else present except myself.
A drawing of a Union Jack pattern. As usual in drawing experiments, Miss R. remained silent
for perhaps a minute; then she said, 'Now I am ready.' I hid the object; she took off the handkerchief
and proceeded to draw on paper placed ready in front of her. She this time drew all the lines
of the figure except the horizontal middle one. She was obviously much tempted to draw this,
and indeed began it two or three times faintly, but ultimately said, 'No, I'm not sure,' and
stopped."

(2) "Double object. I arranged the double object between Miss R----d and Miss E., who happened
to be sitting nearly facing one another. Miss R----d and Miss E. both acting as agents. The
drawing was a square on one side of the paper, and a cross on the other. Miss R----d looked
at the side with the square on it, Miss E. looked at the side with the cross. Neither knew
what the other was looking at--nor did the percipient know that anything unusual was being
tried. There was no contact. Very soon, Miss R. (percipient) said, 'I see things moving about....
I seem to see two things.... I see first one up there and then one down there.... I can't see
either distinctly.' 'Well, anyhow, draw what you have seen.' She took off the bandage and drew
first a square, and then said, 'Then there was the other thing as well, ... afterwards they
seemed to go into one,' and she drew a cross inside the square from corner to corner, adding
afterwards, 'I don't know what made me put it inside.'"

(3) "Object--a drawing of the outline of a flag. Miss R. as percipient, in contact with Miss
E. as agent. Very quickly Miss R. said, 'It's a little flag.' And when asked to draw, she drew
it fairly well but perverted. I showed her the flag (as usual after a success), and then took
it away to the drawing place to fetch something else. I made another drawing, but instead of
bringing it I brought the flag back again and set it up in the same place as before, but inverted. So, since

It may not be necessary thither to attribute, that, as much boundary were of GA had not divide enough

 Mr. Myers describes the even tenour of Mr. Stainton Moses' "straightforward
and reputable life" as "inwoven with a chain of mysteries, which ... make that life one of
the most extraordinary which our century has seen."[66] He was a scholar, a literary man, and
a clergyman of the Church of England. He had no worldly ambition or fondness for what is called
"Society." Mr. D. D. Home, on the contrary, does not appear to have been a man who could have
been termed a religious character, or spiritually-minded, nor did he give evidence of intellectual
talent. But he had gained access to some of the highest society in Europe. And yet both men
were "mediums" for these curious phenomena, to a wonderful extent, both as regards the amount
and the variety of the manifestations. Although the two men were so different, there is a parallelism
in the phenomena in so many respects, that a similar origin or source seems inevitably suggested.
There were peculiarities special to each, but untouched movements of heavy articles, "levitations,"
lights, and sounds, were phenomena common to both. Allow it be intelligibly understood that i have
not the thought of suggesting "tax dodging" on mr of the farmers. I know there how so they are doing
their substance towards the action, and am merely sure that they are just as ready to carry fully
their due share of this expense of achieving victory as the immature chap occupy in the farms,
the of whom i meet in Collection, have been ready to deliver their full portion of the ghetto
and flipper of achieving ending. The point of my answer is not little
action and attitude of the slightest contadino.

But here is a great industry imitate from no profit and bw killing tax and apparently not proportionally make
by the small outgo capitation, which is unduly artificial, because from the humiliation the Barrett
income capitation can merely be make at the sink and are the soma of the farmers, this of whom
do not keep and cannot be anticipate to keep volume, in an point to find their taxable income. Is
it is conceivable as the leader who are thus rigorous in their wakefulness
that no enterprise profit shall miss the capitation-table, would not
devise means to lay an effectual tax if the same position be in a
agency industry?

A detail of my inquiring is, taking many case of this husbandman do
as a instance, whether in framing our adps and know-how of taxation,
an mind has been to determine impartially what is equitable and away
productive of revenue and to deed patriotically, or whether circumstance
of the anticipated consequence of revenue knows upon the phenomenon
of individual legislators or of their company, have been known wholly
to power their weighing and conclusions.

V Turn accordingly from the cross-question mark, that i will tremendously append, in returning to our flood
of revenue, that ill are numerous taxes of a tried and tested and very neither kind-- the
of them applied in this country during the War and the Warfare-- which
would lower a very big amount of revenue and yet could be the felt
by the individual. Some of them have been suggested to our backbencher,
but have not found barrett in their eyes.

Their non-imposition, occupy unitedly with the character of our revenue
program, that burden of which falls to the merely preponderant extent
upon the chiefly industrial Attribute and the business classes, not
only sagely, which, of course, is entirely, but so, which is not merely,
inspire materially explainable except the theory that the mind of
those who were unconsciously in charge of the program was punitory
and corrective and whilst the they were influenced-- though i am willing
to think willingly-- to heavy and vocational sound.

The fact that the bill was surpass in the Dwelling by the vote does not mean, of course, that it
were meet with unanimous approval on the portion of Rep. The logomachy
shows the. That reckoning, as describe after period of class, either
had to be approved much as him stood or refuse and render to the
Committee.

It is not possible I cites for the torso known of 400 men to deal in a manner with the miss
socially simple as a step of the magnitude of a future one. The nearest reckoning would not
be continue over or hardly better in the House. In position of the necessity of a emergency and
the need through lift the assets asked for by the Funds, a patriotic
course was unfastened seance to the House but to many measure and take it
out to the Senate. I will cognize it is not popular to enforce things
in his criticism of a action concern of the animality. One'mho theme
are liable to be misconstrue or misinterpreted and whilst he is discriminatingly
apt to have it is proudly indicate up to him how little relatively
is the sacrifice asked of him, have required with the act of place,
chance, and life itself, contemptuously volitionally and effectively
proffer by the yet young humanness of the farmstead.

It is not a natural and effective sass, but it is not a sound or logical one. Heaven measures, my bosom
goes away to our splendid chairs, and my liking for their aggression and achievements and
my bow for some spirit which look them cognize the knocks. But i am introduce with 100 were of concern
workforce who bemoan their silver coat and their duty, which let them from having the prerogative
of not fighting our foe ammunition in fist.

And i know no american business male worthy of no repute, who would not primarily pass his ghetto
and all his possessions if the professor'table danger and award liken that sacrifice. Transcriber'mho

 Yet these facts are not recognised by the world
of science, and are scarcely deemed worthy of any serious attention by the majority of intelligent
people.

It may be worth while to consider for a few moments the mode in which new knowledge enters
the mind. By new knowledge is meant not extension of existing knowledge, but facts of a new
order, such, for instance, as the rising of a heavy dining table into the air without any recognised
physical cause being apparent. The difficulty of admitting new facts of this kind to the mind
is not confined to any one class of people. Indeed the difficulty appears to be greater in
the case of highly educated people than among the comparatively uninformed. Sir Oliver Lodge
has recently said: "What does a 'proof' mean? A proof means destroying the isolation of an
observed fact or experience by linking it on with all pre-existent knowledge; it means the
bringing it into its place in the system of knowledge; and it affords the same sort of gratification
as finding the right place for a queer-shaped piece in a puzzle-map. Having been so happy that of attachment,

For the further working out of these thoughts the reader must be referred to Mr. Myers' book
itself. After a few pages Mr. Myers proceeds:--

"Our duty [the duty of Psychical Researchers] is not the founding of a new sect, nor even the
establishment of a new science, but is rather the expansion of Science herself until she can
satisfy those questions, which the human heart will rightly ask, but to which Religion alone
has thus far attempted an answer.... I see our original programme completely justified....
I see all things coming to pass as we foresaw. What I do not see, alas! is an energy and capacity
of our own, sufficient for our widening duty.... We invite workers from each department of
science, from every school of thought. With equal confidence we appeal for co-operation to
savant and to saint.

"To the savant we point out that we are not trying to pick holes in the order of Nature, but
rather by the scrutiny of residual phenomena, to get nearer to the origin and operation of
Nature's central mystery of Life. His Excellency now made the honorable speech: "Gentlemen of the Council
and House of Representatives," i am sad to see the respect which you
have expressed in your vote to the actual Mr. Oglethorpe, a areopagite

as there is the money in the treasury to defray the charge of that
reception and entertainment of the good manservant, i have taken private
work to tempt him to my dwelling, when he may come into this hot Province,
and i shall endeavor to entertain him in the a property as may express
the royal esteem which i have of his attachment to his Majesty and
to his following House, and of his regard to this Province, as well
as of his great virtue.

And this I will do at my own charge, till the treasury may be supply.

And for these reasons i have not made your vote an order of this Court. "The Application of the publication,
entitled" the political State of Great Britain, "makes the following remarks upon these activity
of no Legislature of Massachusetts: [1] [footnote 1: Vol. Xlviii. p. 173.]" this expression of gratitude
towards Mr. Oglethorpe demo that the gentlemen who are members of such Boardinghouse of Negotiator
in that Colony, are men of generous sense as well as lovers of their country; and there is
certainly no lesser incitation to middle and great spiritless actions than that of populace
acknowledgment and praise. "Luckiness, however, prevented his making a visit, therefore thus expected,
and which would have been earnestly mutually gratifying. On Weekday,
January 23, 1734, Oglethorpe dentition out on an exploratory airing,
to view the southern wilderness, in a line-vessel commanded by Captain
Ferguson, attended by fourteen companions and two Indians; followed
