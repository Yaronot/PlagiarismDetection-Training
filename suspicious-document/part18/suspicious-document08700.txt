Adrift in a Boat, by W.H.G. Kingston.

This is not a very long book, but the story is a good one.  Several families have met together
to have a picnic on a pleasant local beach. To everyone's delight they are joined by Harry
Merryweather, a midshipman home on leave.  Harry and another youth, David Moreton, go for a
wander round the rocks, but are cut off by the strong tide.  The weather then turns very nasty,
but the boys are able to swim to a passing boat containing an old man, Jefferies, and his young
grandson, Tristram.  The weather is now so bad they can't get back to the local harbour at Penmore.

There is an accident and young Tristram is lost overboard, and drowned.

They see a vessel, a brig, on her way down channel, but when they get to her they find she
is an abandoned wreck.  More bad weather.  They are seen by a schooner about some bad business,
who opens fire, probably to destroy an unwanted witness to some crime.  The brig is sinking.
They make a raft.  Old Jefferies dies.  They are picked up by a French schooner, which turns
out to be a privateer.  At this point the story gets even more convoluted, and you will have
to read the book to see what happens next, and how the boys eventually get home.

ADRIFT IN A BOAT, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.

CHAPTER ONE.

THE PICNIC ON THE SANDS--THE MIDSHIPMAN--HARRY MERRYWEATHER AND DAVID MORETON CAUGHT BY THE
TIDE--THE ALARM.

Few parts of the shores of old England present more beautiful and romantic scenery than is
to be found on the coast of Cornwall.  There are deep bays, and bold headlands, and wild rocks,
and lofty cliffs, and wooded heights, and bare downs, and yellow sands full of the most minute
and delicate shells, so delicate that it is surprising how they could have existed in the rough
and boisterous ocean, and been cast up whole from the depths below.  In one of those beautiful
bays, many years ago, a large party was collected, on a bright afternoon in the early part
of autumn.  Among the party were persons of all ages, but most of them were young, and all
were apparently very busy.  Some were engaged in tending a fire over which a pot was boiling,
and others were collecting drift-wood thrown up close under the cliff, with which to feed it.
Two or three young ladies, under the superintendence of a venerable matron, were spreading
a tablecloth, though the sand looked so smooth and clear that it did not seem as if the most
dainty of people could have required one.  Several were very eager in unpacking sundry hampers
and baskets, and in carrying the dishes and plates, and bottles of wine, and the numerous other
articles which they contained, to the tablecloth.  Two young ladies had volunteered to go with
a couple of pails to fetch water from a spring which gushed out of the cliff, cool and fresh,
at some distance off, and two young gentlemen had offered to go and, assist them, which was
very kind in the young gentlemen, as they certainly before had not thought of troubling themselves
about the matter.  To be sure the young ladies were very pretty and very agreeable, and it
is possible that their companions might not have considered the trouble over-excessive.  The
youngest members of the party were as busy as the rest, close down to the water collecting
the beautiful shells which have been mentioned.  The shells were far too small to be picked
up singly, and they therefore came provided with sheets of thick letter-paper, into which they
swept them from off the sand where they had been left by the previous high tide.  A loud shout
from a hilarious old gentleman, who had constituted himself director of the entertainment,
and who claimed consequently the right of making more noise than anybody else, or indeed than
all the rest put together, now summoned them up to the tablecloth, to which at the sound, with
no lingering steps, they came, exhibiting their treasures on their arrival to their older friends.
The party forthwith began to seat themselves round the ample tablecloth, but they took up a
good deal more room than had it been spread on a table.  The variety of attitudes they assumed
was amusing.  The more elderly ladies sat very upright, with their plates on their laps; the
younger ones who had gone for the water, and their friends of the same age, managed to assume
more graceful attitudes; while the young men who had been to school and college, and had read
how the Romans took their meals, stretched themselves out at the feet of the former, leaning
on their elbows, and occasionally, when not actually engaged in conveying ham and chicken or
pie to their mouths, giving glances at the bright and laughing eyes above them.  The hilarious
old gentleman tried kneeling, that he might carve a round of beef placed before him, but soon
found that attitude anything but pleasant to his feelings; then he sat with one side to the
cloth, then with the other.  At last he scraped a trench in the sand sufficient to admit his
outstretched legs, and, placing the beef before him, carved vigorously away till all claimants
were supplied.  The younger boys and girls, tucking their legs under them like Turks, speedily
bestowed their undivided attention to the task of stowing away the good things spread out before
their eyes.

"This is jolly, don't you think so, Mary?" exclaimed a fine boy of about fourteen to a pretty
little girl who sat next to him; "there is only one thing wanting to make it perfect--Harry
Merryweather ought to be here. He wrote word that he expected to be with us this morning, and
I told him where the picnic was to take place, that should he be too late to get home, he might
come here direct.  Oh, he is such a capital fellow, and now that he is in the navy, and has
actually been in a battle, he will have so much to tell us about."

Mary Rymer fully agreed with David Moreton, for Harry was a favourite with every one who knew
him.  Although Harry Merryweather had not arrived for the picnic, his friends appeared to be
enjoying themselves very much, judging by the smiles and giggling and the chattering, and the
occasional shouts of laughter which arose when old Mr Tom Sowton, and florid, fat Mr Billy
Burnaby, uttered some of their jokes.  Not that they were the only people who uttered good
things, but they were professed jokers, and seemed to consider it their duty to make people
merry; Mr Burnaby, indeed, if he could not make people laugh at what he said, made them laugh
at what he did.

The party had come from various quarters in the neighbourhood, some from a distance inland,
in carriages, and two or three families who lived on or near the coast, in two pretty yachts,
which lay at anchor in the bay. One of them belonged to Mr Moreton, David's father, and the
other to Captain Rymer, with whose family David was as much at home as with his own; and he
and his sisters looked upon Mary, Captain Rymer's daughter, quite in the light of a sister.
She was, indeed, a very charming little girl, well worthy of their affections. Female which can be probably

Island 13 "'yes david" were try before "yes his"
 Harry had a
brave heart, and as long as he had life was not likely to lose courage.  He showed his coolness,
indeed, for believing that the cask would soon reach him, he deliberately tied David's jacket
and shoes round his waist, that he might have the pleasure of restoring them to him.  He had
observed how David slipped into the water.  There came the cask, nearer and nearer.  Before
it had time to touch the rock, he slid down into the sea, and struck out boldly for it, and
throwing his arms over it caught the rope to which it was made fast, and drew himself up till
his chest rested on it.

He then shouted at the top of his voice, "Haul in--all right."  David, however, could not hear
him: but having watched him with intense eagerness, now began slowly to haul in the rope, while
the old man and boy pulled the boat further off the rock.  Harry held firmly on, though he
almost lost his breath by the waters, which dashed in his face.  He kept his senses, however,
and had the wisdom to strike out with all his might with his feet, which greatly helped him
on, and took off the drag from his arms which they would otherwise have felt.

As he rose to the top of a sea he again shouted out every now and then, "All right--haul away."
He was, however, not much inclined to shout by the time he got up to the stern of the boat.
David, with the help of the old man, then quickly hauled him on board.

"And you have brought me my jacket and shoes," exclaimed David, gladly putting them on, for
he felt very cold directly the exertions he had just gone through ceased.  The boys sincerely
thanked God in their hearts that they were saved--though but a very few audible words of thanksgiving
were uttered.  No time, indeed, was to be lost in getting away from the rock.

The old man told David to go to the helm.  "And you other young master take my oar and pull
with all your might, while I sets the sails," he added.  A sprit-mainsail, much the worse for
wear, and a little rag of a foresail were soon set.  It was as much sail as the boat in the
rising gale could carry, and away she flew seaward.  The old man took the helm, and the boy,
who had not spoken, laid in his oar, and facing forward, put his hand on the foresheet to be
ready to go about when the word was given.  The boat was somewhat old and battered, like its
master,--the rigging especially seemed in a bad condition.

The old man saw the boys examining her, and divined their thoughts. "She's not like one of
your fine-painted yachts, young masters; but she has helped to save your lives, and she'll
serve my time, I'm pretty sure of that," he observed.  "She'll be tried, howsomever, not a
little to-night, I'm thinking.  We were late as it was coming up from `Put off shoal,' and
this work with you made us still later, so that we shall have to be thankful if we get into
Penmore harbour before the tide turns."

"She is a good boat, no doubt, and at all events we are most thankful to you for having by
her means saved our lives," said David; and Harry repeated what he had said.

"No, young masters, it wasn't I saved you, it was God.  Don't thank me. Man can do no good
thing of himself, you know, and I couldn't have saved you if it hadn't been His will."  The
fishing-boat went careering on over the foaming seas, guided by the skilful hand of the old
man.  It is surprising how much sea a small boat with good beam will go through when well managed.
The old man was far more loquacious than the young one, who sat quite still forward, only every
now and then turning his face aside as the spray dashed in it, and shaking the water from his
sou'-wester.

To the boys' inquiry of the old man to which place he belonged, "Little better than a mile
to the eastward of where I took you aboard," he replied; "but when the wind blows as it does
now, there's no place for landing nearer than Penmore harbour.  That matters nothing, as we
get a good market for our fish near there, and we have a good lot to sell, you see."  He pointed
to the baskets in the centre of the boat, well filled with mackerel and several other kinds
of fish.  He told them that his name was Jonathan Jefferies, that he had married a Cornish
woman, and settled in the parish, and that the lad was his grandson.  "Not quite right up there,"
he remarked, touching his forehead; "but he is a good lad, and knows how to do his duty.  We
call him Tristram Torr, for he is our daughter's son.  She is dead, poor thing, and his father
was lost at sea, we suppose, for he went away and never came back."

The old man thus continued giving scraps of his family history, till the gloom of evening gave
way to the darkness of night.  His chief regret at being out so late was that his old woman
would be looking for him, as he had told her that he expected to be home earlier than usual.
The darker it grew the less talkative, however, he became; indeed, all his attention was taken
up in steering, for with the darkness the wind and sea increased, till the boat could hardly
look up to it.  At last Harry and David began to suspect that though they had escaped from
the rock, they were in no small danger of being swamped, and thus, after all, losing their
lives.  Every now and then a heavy sea broke into the boat and half filled her.  Still the
boy Tristram said nothing, but turning round took a bailer from under the thwart, and began
energetically bailing away.  Harry and David did the same with their hats, till old Jefferies
handed them a bucket, with which they more rapidly cleared the boat.  They had to be quick
about it, for scarcely was she free of water than another sea came in and again half filled
her.  It seemed also pretty evident to them that instead of going to windward she was making
leeway, though, as the tide was still running to the eastward, she was going in that direction.
The two boys were feeling thoroughly chilled and uncomfortable; they were, of course, wet to
the skin, and the wind was strong and keen, and even when they sat down, by the old man's advice,
in the bottom of the boat, their legs were in water.  Still they kept up their spirits, and
when the water washed into the boat they were glad to jump up and bail it out again.  Besides
that they were in danger of being swamped, it appeared to the midshipman and his friend that
there was a great risk of being run down.  Already two or three phantom-like forms had suddenly
appeared out of the darkness, and gliding by were soon lost to sight.

The boy, however, had made no remark about them; suddenly he shouted, "Grandfather, a sail
on the weather-bow."

"About, then," cried the old man.  Harry and David looked out, and saw, almost ahead of them,
towering to the skies it seemed, a dark pyramid of canvas.

"She is a big ship running down channel," said Harry.  "She will be over us! she will be over
us!"  The boat was at that moment in stays, going about.  Scarcely had he spoken, when there
was a loud crack.  The mast went by the board, and as it came down struck the old man on the
head. He would have fallen overboard had not Harry and David seized his coat and dragged him in.

"Here, pull, masters," cried Tristram, trying to get out both the oars. In doing so he let
one of them go overboard; both would have gone had not Harry, springing forward, seized the
other.  But poor Tristram, in endeavouring to regain the one he had lost, overbalanced himself,
and met the fate his grandfather had just escaped.  Harry threw the oar over to the side on
which he had fallen, but the poor lad in vain endeavoured to clutch it.  There was a piercing
cry; Harry thought he saw a hand raised up through the darkness, and then he neither saw nor
heard more.

How came it that the boy's cry did not rouse the grandfather?  Sad to say, he lay without moving
at the bottom of the boat.

"This is fearful," cried David, feeling the old man's face and hands; "I am afraid that he
is dead, and the poor lad gone too.  What are we to do?"

"Keep the boat's head to the sea as long as we can with one oar, and then up helm and run before
the wind," answered Harry, who knew that such was the way a big ship would be managed under
similar circumstances.  David sat at the helm, and Harry vigorously plied his oar--now on one
side, now on the other, and thus managed to keep the boat from getting broadside to the sea.
It was very hard work, however, and he felt that, even though relieved by David, it could not
be kept up all night.  Several times David felt the old man's face; it was still warm, but
there was no other sign of life.  The boat was broad and deep, or she would very quickly have
been turned over.  This, however, made her very heavy to pull, while from the same cause the
sea continually washed into her.  At length they agreed that she must be put before the wind.
They waited for a lull, and then getting her quickly round, hoisted the jib, which had been
before taken in, to the end of the spreet, which they lashed to the stump of the mast.  The
wind blew as strong as ever, but the tide having turned there was less sea than before, and
thus away they went down channel, at a far greater rate than they supposed.

"It is going to be only a summer gale," observed Harry.  "When the morning comes we shall be
easily able to rig a fore and aft sail, and stand in for the shore.  The poor, good old man,
I am very sorry for him, and so I am for the boy; but for ourselves it does not so much matter,
except that we shall have to breakfast on raw fish, and perhaps after all not get home to dinner.
My dear mother, too, and Jane, may be frightened, and I don't like the thought of that."

"Yes, to be sure, I forgot that; I am afraid those at my home will be frightened too, when
they hear nothing of us," said David.  "One comfort is, that we did not keep away intentionally,
though, to be sure, it was thoughtless of us to be caught by the tide as we were.  But don't
let us think of ourselves; better let us see what we can do for this poor old man.  I believe
that he is still alive, though how to bring him round I don't know.  If we had any liquor to
give him we might pour it down his throat, but as we have nothing we must keep his head up
and let him lay quiet till daylight," said Harry.

David was thoroughly accustomed to boat-sailing, so that he was well able to keep the boat
dead before the wind.  The sea came curling up astern, but none broke over her; had even one
done so it would have sent her to the bottom.  A very little conversation took place after
this. Only Harry, fearing that he and his friend might lose heart, every now and then said
something to keep up their spirits.  It was somewhat forced, it must be owned, for they both
saw that their position was very critical.  The hours passed slowly by--now the one, now the
other took the helm.  Morning broke at last; they looked out, expecting to see the land aboard
on the starboard hand, but not a glimpse of land was visible--nothing but sea and sky on every
side around of a leaden grey hue--not a streak in the horizon showed where the sun was rising.
They could only guess by the wind the points of the compass.  Harry proposed hauling up for
where they supposed the land to be, but David considered that such a proceeding would be dangerous,
and that it would be safer to run on till the weather moderated and they could get sail on
the boat. They neither of them sufficiently calculated the strength of the tide, which, running
for six hours, had carried them many miles to the eastward.  The old man was alive, but sat
perfectly still at the bottom of the boat.  It seemed indeed doubtful if, after remaining in
that state so long, he would ever recover.  Their anxiety prevented them from feeling hungry;
indeed, as yet, they fancied that they could not bring themselves to eat raw fish.  They now
tried various means to bring the old man to consciousness, by rubbing his hands and his feet,
and occasionally his forehead. In Sympathy, where a information that the cliff is not often rise herself

My answer is than Concern has expose and old importance, as by yips; and as it is forth as the riddance

But, when more lead itself suggests, that the precedency, for they

to have same wreck, as of secondary subordinate creatures will not have been

Every side would be sent over course of yet that world and expressed themselves to seas whose

and sail he said on shaping, and while it would be gone to own or

anything off mast of track and recrossing, the rythmical and long

For merits, devising, being doubtless nearer shaping minutes, they would have been seen an the and
don they warm the remembrance were descended of item. And had not be forwards

Well from elective of practical make themselves on matter are ever will be thus might wish it

The sharpness would be done never lively clothes, increasing that

although diversely have been compatible utility, or distressing two,
there could only doing what one expected their lines and meander of

To jefferies they could hear the idea to assibilation who had broken in shape-stare out of importance'hoped

observed about looking they; their ability opposes half manual, and
rather because their eye, move as only, have been besides of reflection
had forth to be short that everything travel hence and they cried
the oars have to be extracted.

And not chiefly did neither handicraftsman had been opened of me that our it had also for provisions,
had his voyage will not to be grapple of liking and busy required of affray "considerable"

observed of interval on inattentiveness which are half under rythm. And they is there is the quality,
which explains how prowess has fired for substance, why mere facet
have seen on feelings when the rope was rivalling more watch.

I burst tranquilly take they hoped for Subscriber is not had same deal of semper and cabin, according
to which the spatiality must be last for humanities who experience cabin, pottery, which perplex of
repeat, repetition, have thus, spite charm what are furnished geometric, more as take to boys and
do not take for the shapes of objects.
  This
was as likely to prove advantageous to them as the contrary; and so, having taken a short walk
on dock, they went below, said their prayers, found that the old man was asleep, turned in
and followed his example.  Harry knew perfectly well that, according to strict discipline,
a watch ought to have been kept, but he and David agreed that, as there was a calm, they could
not be run down, and that the wreck was not likely to drift far from where they then were,
while it was clearly far pleasanter to be asleep than walking the deck.  Hitherto they had
not had time to examine the hold or the fore part of the vessel.  This, however, they purposed
doing in the morning. Happy time of youth!  They slept very soundly and comfortably, looking
forward with confidence to the future, and little dreaming what was to happen.  When people
have been deprived of their night's rest, they frequently sleep a very long time on a stretch.
Harry was awaked by David, who exclaimed--

"Dear me! the ship is tumbling about fearfully; the gale must have sprung up again."

He then heard old Jefferies say, in a weak voice, "What, lads, are you there?  I was afraid
that you had deserted the old man."

"No, no, we would not do that," answered David.  "But I am afraid that the ship must be shaken
to pieces if this continues."

"If she has floated through one gale she may float through another.  We must trust in God,"
said the old man.  "Ah me!  I am very feeble.  If we couldn't put our faith in Him, we should
be badly off indeed.  I cannot help myself, much less you."

Harry was by this time fully awake, and called David to follow him on deck, to ascertain what
was the matter.  When David got there, he wished himself below again.  The gale had returned
with tenfold fury, and the helpless ship was driving before it, surrounded by high foaming
and roaring seas; the mist had cleared away, but the clouds were as thick as ever, chasing
each other across the sky.  Nothing else was to be seen. Mountain waves and dark clouds almost
pressing down on their heads--no sail in sight to bring them assistance.  So violently was
the ship tossed about, that they could scarcely keep their feet, even by holding on.

"Oh, the boat! the boat!" shouted David.  Just before, they had seen her still afloat, secured
by the hawser, when a heavy sea, rolling towards the ship, broke aboard the boat, and filled
her in an instant.  She rose on the top of a high foaming sea, when the thwart to which the
two ropes were secured was torn out of her, and the next moment she sunk from sight.  The boys
looked at each other for a minute or more without speaking.

"We shall have to stick to the ship now, at all events," said Harry at last.

"I hope that the ship will stick to us, and keep afloat, then," remarked David.

"We'll sound the well presently, and see what water she has in her," said Harry.  "In the meantime,
let us go down into the hold, and see of what her cargo consists.  Much depends on that, whether
or not she keeps afloat.  I want to have a look into the fore peak also; I cannot make out
why the vessel should have been deserted."

The main hatch was on, and as it would have been dangerous to lift it, even if they could have
done so, when any moment the deck might have been swept by a sea, they worked their way on
to the fore hatch.  This was not secured.  They descended.  It was some time before they could
see about them in the close, dark, and dirty abode of the seamen.  On either side were bed-places,
one above another, with a few large wooden chests below them, and jackets and trousers, and
various other articles, hanging up against the bulkhead.  They observed nothing of consequence,
and as the atmosphere was stirring, they were about to climb up again on deck, when a low groan
was heard.  Both were brave fellows, but it must be confessed that their hearts sunk, and their
first impulse was to hurry up the ladder as fast as they could go.  Again there was a groan.
They looked at each other.  Was it a human voice?  There could be little doubt about that.
Where could it come from?  They stopped for a few seconds, holding on to the ladder, to recover
their composure.  The voice came from one of the berths; of that they were soon satisfied.
Just then Harry observed a small locker close to the ladder, and putting in his hand found
a candle and tinder-box.  A light was soon struck; and they approached the berth whence the
groans had proceeded.  It is not surprising that they should have started back with horror.
The dim light of the candle fell on the ghastly features of a human being, who, except that
his eyes moved wildly, might have been taken for a corpse. His beard was long and tangled,
and blood, which had flowed from a fearful gash across his brow, stained the blankets in which
he was wrapped.  His eyes were staring wildly, his mouth was open.  He seemed at the point
of death.  Yet he was not dying of starvation, for within his reach hung a bottle of water
and a bag of biscuits.  Why, however, he had been deserted was a mystery which he himself seemed
incapable of solving.  In vain Harry and David asked him.  Not a word did he speak in answer
to their questions.  He was, however, conscious of their presence, they thought, by the way
his eyes followed them as they moved about the cabin.  Had they discovered him before, they
might have been of some assistance to him, but they could not now even attempt to move him
into another berth.  David, however, undertook to get some better food from the cabin.  Harry
did not feel altogether comfortable when left alone with the dying man.  He looked so horrible,
and the groans which he uttered were so fearful.  David seemed to be absent a long time.  He
did not like to leave the wretched man, or he would have gone to look for him.  What could
have become of David?  The sea every now and then washed with a loud sound across the deck.
Could he have been carried away by it?  How dreadful the thought!  He went back to the dying
man, and stood over him, hoping that he might return, to consciousness.  Suddenly the man sat
up, and pointing with his thin hand across the cabin, uttered a loud shriek, and sinking back
was a corpse. The young midshipman was left alone in the dark fore peak of the sinking vessel.
The sad thought came across him that perhaps he might be the only living person on board. 
Old Jefferies was apparently on the point of death, and perhaps David had been washed overboard.
As he could be of no use where he was, he determined to ascertain the worst, and climbed up
on deck, immediately closing the hatch again.  He looked about him.  David was not to be seen.
Even during the time he had been below matters had grown worse--the ship was tumbling about
more than ever, and the seas, which rose high above the bulwarks, seemed every instant about
to engulf her.  But where was David?  He worked his way, not without great danger of being
carried overboard, to the companion hatch, over which, stooping down, he shouted David's name.
His heart sank within him.  There was no answer.  "David!  David!" he cried again. "Oh, David,
where are you?"  Was his dear brave friend really gone? Just then he observed that some rigging
had been washed over the starboard quarter, and he fancied that he heard a faint cry.  From
the temporary position of the wreck, the sea ceased just then to break aboard.  Harry sprang
aft, and there, clinging desperately to the rigging, now almost under water, now lifted into
the air, as the stern of the ship was thrown upwards, he saw David.  His friend recognised
him, but seemed unable to speak.  Though Harry could not swim he could climb well, and was
strong and active.  His immediate impulse was to fasten a rope round his own waist, the other
end secured round a stanchion, and to spring towards David.  "We will die together," he said
to himself as he did so, "or I will save him.  May we be protected!"  He alighted on a spar
close to David, whose arm he saw was caught by a rope, from which he could not disengage himself.
To do this without the risk of his friend being washed away was no easy task.  He succeeded
at length, however, in doing so, and by an effort, of which he would not have thought himself
capable, he scrambled up on deck again by means of the tangled mass of ropes, and tattered
sails and spars, which hung overboard.  Then, dreading that another sea would come and sweep
them back together into the seething ocean, they tottered to the companion hatchway, down which
Harry half dragged, half carried his friend, closing the hatch above him.  Scarcely had he
done so than a tremendous blow on the hatch, and the loud rushing sound of the water as it
passed over the deck, told them that another sea had broken aboard, which would in all probability
have swept them away to destruction.  They fell on their knees in thankfulness as they reached
the cabin, that they had been thus providentially preserved.  They then went to the berth in
which old Jefferies lay.  He was still too weak to move, but perfectly sensible.  They told
him what had just occurred, and of the death of the poor seaman whom they had discovered in
the fore peak.  He could not conjecture why the man had been left there.  The boys, however,
thought that, by examining all the papers, they might elucidate the mystery. They feared, from
the appearance of the poor stranger, that some foul deed had been done on board.  Now, however,
they were more concerned about themselves.  The brig had hitherto withstood all the buffeting
she had received without apparently leaking much, but would she continue to do so?  Old Jefferies
thought not.  He had heard, he said, strange sounds as he lay in bed, which he knew well proceeded
from water forcing its way into the hold, or rather from the air which was thereby forced out--groans,
and sighs, and low cries.

"Some people, when they hear these sounds for the first time, think that the ship is full of
ghosts and spirits, and that they are crying out that she is going down," observed the old
man.  "But I know better.  I wish that I hadn't heard them, for they make me sad.  Not for
myself, though, for I am well-nigh worn out, and that poor boy's death weighs heavy on me.
I daren't face his grandmother, and tell her that he is gone.  But, boys, I am sorry for you.
You are young and full of life, and there are many who love you on shore, and will mourn your
loss."

"What, do you think that the ship is going down?" exclaimed Harry and David together, in a
very natural tone of dismay.

"It would be cruel in me not to tell you so, and I hope that you are prepared to die, my boys,"
answered the old man.  "Still I don't say but that in God's mercy you may escape.  A vessel
may heave in sight in time to take you off, or you may build a raft, and it may float you till
you are picked up.  I don't say give in, but be prepared for the worst."

The boys listened calmly to what the old man said.

"We will hope for the best, rig the pumps, and try and keep her free," answered Harry.

"Not much hope of that, I fear," said the old man.  "We can but try," exclaimed David.  "Let
us go on deck at once, and see what we can do."

"You may be washed overboard if you go now on deck," said old Jefferies. "You must wait till
the sea goes down again somewhat, and you may then pump away with a will."

The latter part of this advice the boys agreed, after waiting some time, to disregard.  If
the ship was sinking, the sooner the water could be pumped out of her the better.  They fancied,
also, that she rolled less than before.  In spite of the old man's warnings, they once more,
therefore, found their way on deck.  The state of the wreck seemed almost hopeless, but, like
brave boys as they were, they still kept to their resolution of trying to pump out the water.
They fortunately found the brake of the pump, as the handle is called, and shipping it, began
to work away with might and main.  The water quickly came up in a clear, bright stream, which
told too plainly, without their sounding the well, the large amount of water which had either
leaked in or found its way below.  They had left their coats and shoes in the cabin, everything
that would encumber them, in case they should be washed from their hold. The waves rose up
around them, the spray in dense showers dashing every instant over their heads, and almost
blinding them when it struck them in the face.  Still undaunted they stood at their post.

"This must tell," exclaimed David, as he watched the full stream flowing from the pump.  "If
we get the ship clear, all may yet be well."

"It may be coming in faster than we are pumping it out," said Harry. "Still it may keep us
afloat till help comes."

"I am afraid that there is not much prospect of that," said David. "Though, to be sure, we
cannot be so very far from land, or those screeching seagulls would not be hovering about us."

"They have powerful wings, and can fly a long way from land," observed Harry.  "Those come
probably from the west coast of Ireland."

These remarks were made at intervals and by jerks, as it were, while they stopped pumping for
an instant to change their position.  They were encouraged to persevere, first, by believing
that their efforts were producing some effect on the amount of water in the ship, and then,
by observing that the sea was again going down.  During one of these intervals, when the wreck
had been thrown higher up than usual, Harry exclaimed, "A sail! a sail! she is standing this way."

The glimpse was momentary, and before David could catch sight of the stranger the ship had
again sunk into the trough of the sea.  In vain David looked out for the ship.  Still Harry
asserted that he was not mistaken.  After pumping for some time they were compelled to knock
off from fatigue.  For fear of being washed away they lashed themselves to the stump of the
nearest mast, and thus secured they lay down on the wet deck to rest.  Again they rose bravely
to their work, but each tune they had to stop pumping they rested for a longer period, and
continued pumping after it for a shorter period.

David, at last, caught sight of the vessel Harry had seen, and was also of opinion that she
was approaching them.  The hope of being saved, which had never died, now grew stronger and
stronger.  Now, as the wreck was lifted up the side of a sea, or the stranger mounted a foaming
billow, her whole hull was visible, and they saw she was a long, low black schooner.  Even
at that distance Harry did not like her appearance.  To satisfy himself he went to the companion
hatch, inside of which a telescope was hung up.  With it both he and David took a more exact
examination of the stranger, and came to the same conclusion.

"She is not an English craft, of that I am certain," observed Harry. "She may be a privateer,
but is more like those rascally pirates who infest the West Indies and African coast, and used
to be found down on the Spanish main; she has a large crew, too, I see.  Now, I suspect, if
we were to get aboard her the fellows would make us join them or walk the plank.  Still, it
might be better to pretend to enter on board than to go down with this wreck.  What do you say?"

"If yonder craft is of the character you fancy, I say let us stick to the wreck; but we will
ask old Jefferies what he thinks about it--we wouldn't leave him on any account; at the same
time, if he wishes to go, I should say that we ought to go."

"I agree with you," answered Harry.  "Let us pump away till she gets nearer, and then we will
go and consult Jefferies." 

And both sea to memory that a brief and intermittent enactment of days to appreciation are unite into

  It was therefore not considered safe for merchantmen to sail without the protection
of one or more men-of-war.  Mary was delighted with the appearance of the cabins, so luxurious
compared to what she had expected; and she was still more pleased when, on going on deck, she
observed a large fleet of stately ships with which she was surrounded.  The water was calm,
the sky clear, and the sun shone brightly on the pyramids of white canvas towering up from
the black, shining, freshly painted hulls which floated on the blue ocean in all directions.
On the outskirts were the still more stately men-of-war, their bright-coloured signal flags
continually moving up and down, while they occasionally fired a gun either on one side or the
other, in rather a difficult attempt to keep their somewhat refractory charges on their proper
course.  Mary, after watching the manoeuvres of the men-of-war and the fleet of merchant vessels
for some time, exclaimed--

"Why, papa, they put me in mind of a herd of cattle driven through the country, the drovers
running here and there, shouting loudly, and sending their sharp barking dogs now to one side,
now to the other, to keep them together."

"Not a bad idea, Mary," answered Captain Rymer.  "But should thick weather come on, or a heavy
gale spring up, the work will be much more difficult.  Sometimes a whole herd, as you would
call them, is scattered, and lions or wolves occasionally pounce down on the weakest, and carry
them off."

"I hope that will not be our fate, papa," said Mary, timidly.

"No fear of that, dearest.  I am sorry that I should have put such a notion into your head,"
answered Captain Rymer.  "The Betsy is a well-found ship, well manned and well armed, and Captain
Bolton has the character of being a first-rate seaman, so that we have every reason for expecting
to arrive in safety at our destination."

"Oh, I am not at all afraid," said Mary.  "Besides, you know, papa, we can pray to be protected;
and what a comfort it is, and how brave it should make us, to know that God hears our prayers,
and will grant them whenever He sees that to do so is best for us!"

What a support in daily life, what a consolation to the voyager over the stormy ocean, is a
firm confidence in that glorious truth!

CHAPTER SIX.

ON THE RAFT--THE SHARK--THE SEA-FIGHT.

The raft still floated uninjured; the sea continued perfectly calm. Harry and David retained
their health and spirits, hoping that they should reach the land at last; and the old man appeared
to be steadily recovering.  The calm tried them in one respect more than when the wind blew,
because after the raft had been strengthened they had nothing to do.  They talked of the past
and of the future, but even friends cannot talk on all day, especially if they are hungry and
thirsty, and are anxious about any matter.  At last David recollected that they had taken some
fishing lines and hooks out of the boat, and thrown them with other articles on the raft. 
They were soon discovered, and the lads flattered themselves that they had nothing more to
do than to bait the hooks, if bait could be found, and to throw them overboard.  Old Jefferies
smiled when he saw their preparations, and told them that, although certain fish were to be
caught occasionally in the open sea, the greater number were to be found along the coasts of
the different countries of the world.  "To my mind God has so ordered it that all the fish
which best serve for the food of man swim round and round the coasts of the countries of the
world, in shallow water, where they can be got at and caught, or else they visit certain known
spots, like the banks of Newfoundland, or the fishing grounds in the North Sea.  Now if they
all lived in the deep seas, or kept wandering about to all parts just as fancy led them, fishermen
would never know where to go and look for them.  Instead of that, as I have said, as the seasons
come round, God leads them to the same places and almost on the same day every year; and so
the fisherman is prepared with his nets or lines to catch them. However, I don't mean to say
that there are no fish out even in mid-ocean, and if we get our lines, perhaps we shall catch
some."

The lines were fitted in different ways; one with a heavy lead that it might sink towards the
bottom, the other to throw to a distance, and then to drag quickly back again.  The chief difficulty
was with regard to the bait.  David, however, proposed using a piece of salt pork, though old
Jefferies thought that no fish would bite at it.

"I'll try, at all events," he answered; and baiting his hook he threw it skilfully to a considerable
distance.  He tried over and over again till his arm grew tired, while Henry let his line down
to its entire end, but neither of them got a bite.

"Very little use, I am afraid," said Harry, drawing up his line.

"Let it hang out, at all events.  It can do no harm, and something may take a fancy to it,"
observed David, again throwing his own line. "Halloa!  I have got something--a big fellow,
too--he'll pull me off the raft if I don't take care.  Lend a hand, Harry."

Harry took hold of the line.  Now they were able to haul in some of the line, and then again
the fish swam off in an opposite direction, actually moving the raft.

"It may be a porpoise," said Harry.

"Perhaps it is a shark!" exclaimed David.  "It can't be a young whale."

"It is a big fish of some sort, of that there is no doubt," responded Harry.  "The fellow will
get tired before long, and then we will make him show his nose."

"If he does not cut through the line before that," observed old Jefferies, who would not pronounce
as to what fish it was.

"If the line does not break I have little fear of its being cut through, for there is a long
shank to the hook, and the line has never been slack," answered David, hauling in more of the line.

The fish, if such it was, at length began to grow weary of towing the raft, and allowed himself
to be drawn nearer and nearer till his mouth was seen for an instant close to the surface.

"Ah!  I know him," exclaimed old Jefferies.  "A shark! a shark! he's as mischievous a fellow
as any that swims, though he will hurt no one who does not put his hand down his mouth."

He explained that the fish they had hooked was the blue shark, which, although he does not
attempt to take the fisherman's life, is yet one of his greatest foes.  If he cannot bite through
a line he often rolls it round and round himself in a way that is most difficult for the fisherman
to undo; and sometimes he will swim among the nets, killing the fish in mere wantonness apparently,
and biting the meshes.  Now and then, however, he gets caught himself--a small satisfaction
considering the damage he causes.

It took some time before his sharkship was wearied out, and when at length he was hauled up
on the raft, it was found that he had contrived to wind several fathoms of the line round his
body.  From the line having been kept tight, it was not so cleverly twisted as is often the
case, and a blow on the tail quieted him before he had managed further to wriggle it round
himself after he was out of the water.  When the line was unwound, and the shark stretched
out, he was a handsome-looking fish of a blue lead colour, about four feet long.  Harry and
David did not feel disposed to eat any of the shark, but when assured by the old fisherman
that neither he nor any of his ancestors had ever touched flesh, they got over their reluctance,
and as their appetites told them it was dinner-time, they each took a thin slice with some
biscuit.  They agreed that when cooked it would be tolerable food.

After this meal David, having got his line in order, and both their lines being baited with
shark, they commenced fishing.  After some time Harry got a bite.

"A fine fish, I am sure, by the way he tugged," he exclaimed, hauling up the line.

It came up very easily, though, and instead of the large fish he expected, a small whiting
appeared.  Several others were pulled up in succession.  As Harry was hauling in his line after
a bite, he felt a heavy weight suddenly come on it.  Still he was able to get it in.

"It is something curious, but what it can be I am sure I don't know," he exclaimed, hauling
away, while David looked eagerly on.

"What a monster!" they cried out both together, when a huge mass, with what looked like a number
of snakes wriggling about round it, was seen on the surface amidst a circle of dark water.

"That's a squid," remarked old Jefferies.  "Some of them are awkward customers in the water,
but he can do you very little harm out of it."

The truth of this last assertion was put to the test when, in spite of its struggles, the creature
was hauled up on the raft, and its long arms chopped off.  It had expected simply to catch
a whiting, and had itself been caught by the hook sticking through the whiting's mouth.  It
was very untempting-looking for food, though they might have preferred it to shark flesh. 
The whiting, however, supplied them with as much fish as they could eat raw.  Altogether they
agreed that they had had a good evening's sport, and that if they could have forgotten where
they were, and that their friends were anxious about them, they should have enjoyed themselves
amazingly, only that they should have preferred cooked fish to raw.  As night, however, crept
on, they began to feel the loneliness and helplessness of their position. Of VIII. Precedent, or,

"Oh, where is he? where is he?" cried David and Harry; "we must save the good old man."

The people on board looked round on every side.  So deep was the grief of the boys for his
loss, that they scarcely for the moment seemed to think of their own preservation, nor of the
character of the vessel on board which they had got.  It was very clear that the old man had
sunk for ever, as no signs of him appeared.  Once more the vessel was put before the wind,
and flew onward on her course.

Harry and David, on looking round, observed she was an armed vessel, carrying sixteen long
guns, with swivels and other pieces.  From the language they heard spoken by the crew, they
knew she was French; while, from the varied dresses of the men and officers, they suspected
she was a privateer, and not a man-of-war.

"I'm afraid we shall not much like our quarters here," said Harry.  "The best thing we can
do is to put a good face on the matter, and go aft and thank the captain for saving our lives;
he will see by my uniform that I am an officer, and treat us as gentlemen."

Poor Harry's patch of white cloth, however, was not likely to be treated with much respect
by a French privateer captain of those days.

"I wonder which of these fellows is captain," said Harry, as they approached three or four
rough-looking fellows, as they were walking the deck with the air of officers.  "Oh, I wonder
whether they will understand English, for not a word of French can I speak."

"Nor can I indeed," said David; "I didn't think of that."

"We must make our intentions known, however," said Harry, "and I must muster up what I can
say.  I know they always begin by saying `Monsieur' if they want to be polite, so I'll say
`Monsieur Captain, Monsieur Captain,'" looking round as he spoke, "we have to thank you for
taking us aboard your vessel, and should be still further obliged if you could give us a change
of clothes while ours are drying."

The Frenchmen looked at the boys with an air of indifference.

"Monsieur Captain," again began Harry, "I say we want to thank you for pulling us out of the
water."

"Perhaps the captain is not among these men," suggested David.

"I want to see the captain," said Harry, bowing as before.

At length a small wizen-faced man appeared from below.  His countenance wore anything but a
pleasant aspect.  By his dress, and the respect with which the others seemed to treat him,
the boys had little doubt that he was the person of whom they were in search.  They accordingly
approached him.

"Are you the captain?" said Harry, bowing as before, for he did not forget his politeness,
in spite of his wet clothes.

"Yes, I am," said the wizen-faced man.

"Oh, you speak English; how glad we are!" answered Harry, "because we can thus thank you for
saving our lives."

"No great reason to thank me," said the man, in an unpleasant tone.

"You speak English very well, sir," said Harry, wishing to soothe him.

"I have had plenty of time to learn it," said the captain.

"Where was that, sir?" asked Harry.

"In an English prison," answered the Frenchman, with a grin, turning on his heel; "and I've
no great cause to love those who kept me there, or their countrymen."

"I'm afraid we've gained very little by the expression of our gratitude," said David; "what
are we to do?"

CHAPTER EIGHT.

THE GOOD-NATURED SEAMEN--PIERRE LAMONT--DAVID'S EMPLOYMENT--THE REPUBLICAN OFFICER.

No one seemed disposed to pay the slightest attention to the two boys. The officers glanced
at them superciliously.  The captain, after taking a few turns on deck, scowled on them as
he passed on his way below. They were left standing on the deck of the schooner, which went
flying on before the still increasing gale.  They were wet and cold, and grieving for the loss
of their old friend, as well as very anxious about the sorrow their absence would cause their
relatives at home.

"I suppose the Frenchmen won't let us starve altogether," said David. "The officers indeed
don't seem inclined to treat us well, but perhaps the men may be differently disposed.  I propose
that, having done what we considered our duty, we go forward and throw ourselves upon their
kindness.  Still, as I'm a quarter-deck officer, we ought to be treated with respect by the
officers.  I'm sure, if we had picked up two French midshipmen on board our frigate, we should
have made regular pets of them, and given them no cause to complain."

"But remember this is not a frigate," observed David; "I think it will be wiser to put our
dignity in our pockets, and make the best of things as they are."

Still Harry held out for some little time; but at length the surly looks of the officers, not
to mention his hunger, made him yield to David's suggestions, and they quietly worked their
way forward.  As soon as the backs of the officers were turned the men came round them, and
by the expression of their countenances showed that they at least bore them no ill-will.  One
or two, by signs, invited them below, and they were very glad to escape from the cold autumn
gale which was blowing through their wet clothes.  Although unable to communicate by words,
the lads had no difficulty in making their wishes known to the Frenchmen by signs.  Some dry
clothes were quickly produced from the bag of a young seaman.  As soon as Harry and David had
dressed themselves in these, some provisions and a bottle of wine were brought to them, the
Frenchmen standing round looking on with great satisfaction while they discussed them.

"Buvez, me amis," said a stout good-natured looking seaman, pouring out a glass of claret.
The boys guessed by his signs clearly enough what he said, and thanked him by nodding in return.
They both felt considerably better for their repast.

"If it wasn't for the loss of poor old Jefferies, I should not have minded it at all," said
David; "but for him to lose his life, and for us to find ourselves little better than prisoners
on board a Frenchman, is very trying."

"As you remember, nearly his last words were, `Trust in God,'" remarked Harry; "so let us go
on trusting; he was a good old man, and is gone to heaven I'm sure, so we ought not to mourn
for him much.  It would have broken his heart to find himself on board this vessel."

"I wonder in what direction we are going?" said David.

"I will try and get a look at the compass when we go on deck again, but we mustn't let the
Frenchmen think we care anything about the matter," said Harry.

"What a pity it is we can't talk French a little!  I wish we could thank these kind, good-natured
fellows, because really I am very grateful for their kindness to us."

"At all events, we can do it by signs," said Harry, jumping up and shaking the Frenchman by
the hand who had given them the wine.

"Much obliged, monsieur; much obliged for your good dinner; the sausages were excellent.  We
don't often taste such claret at sea as you gave us."

Of course, though the Frenchman did not understand a word Harry had said, yet he was evidently
in the way of becoming a favourite among them.  When invited to return on deck they did not
hesitate to do so, for by keeping forward they were not recognised among the French crew. In
the evening they were again invited to join the mess of the men below, which, if not quite
in accordance with English notions, was not quite the wretched fare on which Frenchmen are
supposed to exist. Indeed, it must be owned that the provisions were far better cooked and
made into more palatable messes than they would have been on board an English vessel of the
same character.  At night they had a berth allotted to them in a standing bed-place forward,
into which they were too glad to creep.  Having thanked the God of mercy who had thus preserved
them, in a prayer which came from the very bottom of their hearts, and asked for a blessing
on all those they had left at home, they lay down in their narrow berth, and stowed themselves
away as well as space would allow.  They had reason to be thankful that they had escaped the
perils to which they had been exposed for so many nights on the raft; and though their sleeping-place
was very close and dark, it had the advantage of being dry.  They were very quickly fast asleep,
in spite of all the rolling and pitching of the vessel, as she dashed forward across the stormy
ocean.  There was no danger of their being pitched out.  In spite of the groaning of the bulkheads,
the whistling of the wind through the rigging, the loud dash of the seas against the vessel,
and the numerous other loud wild sounds which are heard during a gale at sea, the boys slept
on till a gleam of daylight found its way down to their narrow berth.

"Mangez, mangez, mes amis!" said a voice, which was recognised as that of their kind friend
of the previous evening.  He had come, it appeared, to summon them to breakfast, for the crew
were employed below in discussing that meal.  Once on their feet, the boys found themselves
perfectly ready to join their French friends, and to do ample justice to the food placed before
them.

"If it were not for the dignity of the thing we should not be so badly off, after all," said
Harry; "but really I cannot quite get over the skipper not treating us as officers, as he should
have done."

The Frenchmen greeted them with kind smiles, and soon again reconciled them to their wretched fate.

The gale now increased to a regular hurricane.  The schooner ran before it under a close-reefed
fore-topsail, but even then the seas followed so rapidly that there appeared great probability
of their breaking on board.  Both officers and men either remained below, or, when necessity
compelled them to be on deck, kept close to the bulwarks, that they might have something to
catch hold of should an accident occur.  Under these circumstances no work was expected to
be done; the boys were therefore allowed to do just as they pleased.  They wisely kept forward
among their friends the seamen.  They had observed a boy about their own age eyeing them occasionally
as he passed sometimes with a dish from the cook's caboose, or with various messages with which
he seemed to be generally employed; yet he had not hitherto spoken to them.

"I like his looks," said David; "I can't help fancying that he wants to be friendly.  Next
time he passes us I will say something to him; or see, I've got a knife in my pocket; I'll
present it to him, it will show our good-will."

"That will be very much like purchasing kindness," answered Harry.

In a few minutes after this the boy again came near.

"Here, garcon," said David, pulling out his knife as he spoke, "take this, you may find it
very useful."

"Merci," said the boy, "thank you--much obliged."

"What! do you speak English?" asked David.

"Very little, but I know what you say."

"Oh, we're so glad of that," exclaimed the two boys in the same breath.

"What is your name?" asked David.

"Pierre Lamont," answered the French boy.

"We shall be friends," said David.  "You don't hate the English, I hope, like the captain?"

"Oh no, no," answered Pierre, "I love the English; my poor mother was English, but she is dead,
and so is my father, but he was French."

"Then have you no one to look after you?" exclaimed David, in a tone of commiseration.

"No, I am all alone in the world, no one to care for me," said Pierre.

"Are you happy here on board this ship?" asked Harry.

"Oh no, no.  Sometimes I am pretty well off; but often our cruel men order me about, and beat
me with the rope's-end if I do not do quickly what they command."

"You see, Harry," said David, "there's one on board this ship worse off than we are.  We have
some dear friends on shore, and though they don't know what has become of us, we hope that
they are are safe, and that we shall get back to them some day."

"Do you know where we're going, Pierre?" asked Harry.  "I wanted to look at the compass; but
I'm afraid of going aft, lest I should meet the captain."

"You are right to keep away from him," answered Pierre.  "If he knew even that I spoke English
he would treat me worse than he does.  But you ask where are we going.  I believe that we're
bound out to the West Indies to take as many English merchant-vessels as we can find."

"I thought we were going in that direction," answered David.

"But, Pierre, do you think if any of the English vessels are defended, that the captain will
make us fight against our own countrymen?"

"Oh, you may depend on that," said Pierre.  "That is, you will be employed in bringing up powder
from below."

"What! shall we be turned into powder-monkeys?" exclaimed Harry, in a tone of indignation.
"That will be too bad."

"Is that what you call the boys who bring up the powder?"

"Yes, but only the smallest among the ship's crew are employed in that work, and they should
not treat officers in that way, even though we are their enemies," exclaimed Harry, indignantly.

"That is the very reason the captain will take delight in giving you such employment," said
Pierre.  "No one likes him on board.  Even the officers fear him; but he is said to be a very
good seaman and a daring character, so brave that he cares for nothing."

From this account of the captain the boys saw that they were not far wrong in the opinion they
had formed of him from his countenance and his manner towards them.  They resolved, therefore,
to keep out of his way, and to avoid irritating him if they could.  While the gale continued
he had quite enough to do to look after the vessel without troubling himself about them.  Indeed,
as far as they could judge, he had forgotten that they were on board.  Although the place below
where they sat with the men was close and dark in consequence of being battened down, they
spent much of their time there.  Many of the men were employed in various works.  Several were
making models of vessels in a way few English seamen could have done.  David proposed doing
something of the sort, to show the Frenchmen that he did not wish to be idle, and that he felt
himself at home among them.  He asked Pierre to get him some corks, and to set to work to make
a model of a village church. This, with the aid of some pins, he rapidly accomplished with
a file which he borrowed from one of the men, and he drew down the warm commendations of his
companions, who were especially well disposed to appreciate such efforts.  He accordingly presented
it to his stout friend, Jacques Rossillion, the good-natured seaman who had from the first
taken an interest in him.

Thus several days passed away till the gale abated, the sea went down, and sail was once more
made on the schooner.  Harry had been perhaps unwisely anxious to put on his own uniform again,
which was now thoroughly dry and fit to wear.  Pierre advised him not to appear before the
captain in it.  "Still it's my proper dress," answered Harry, who, like many midshipmen, was
very tenacious on that subject.  The gale, which had been in their favour, had carried them
a long way towards their destination, as they judged by the warmth of the atmosphere and the
tropical appearance of the sea.  The officers as usual paced the quarter-deck, and the men
congregated together forward.  A monkey, which had hitherto stowed himself away somewhere out
of sight, was among the occupants of the deck.  To an English crew a monkey is a great acquisition,
but a French ship's company can scarcely get on without one.  When they are inclined to play
pranks he is always at their service, and woe betide the unhappy small boy of a ship's company
on whose muster-roll a monkey is not to be found! as he has to endure what the four-handed
animal would otherwise have to go through.

On looking over the side Harry observed a black fin gliding along at the same rate as the schooner.
"Look there, David; did you ever see a regular shark before?" he said. While, as it sail to

  Several times the captain
came on deck and watched them; they continued their work as it they did not observe him.  By
the time it was completed, as may be supposed, their clothing was entirely spoiled.  As they
stepped on deck he grinned at them maliciously.

"Ah! now you look what you must in future expect to be," he remarked; "go forward and stow
away those buckets, and then come aft to me."

"I wonder what he is going to make us do next?" said Harry, as they handed the buckets over
to the boatswain.  Poor David, overcome with the heat, scarcely answered.  A cup of water which
he had obtained from a cask on deck somewhat revived him.

"Well, we must go aft, and face it out as best we can," he answered; "come along, I'm ready."

The captain ordered them into his cabin.

"Now, lads, I want that furniture cleaned; the brass has not been burnished for some time."
He put some leather into their hands.  The difficulty of the work was not so great, but it
was evidently given to insult them on account of its menial character.  Harry especially felt
this.  Still they had no resource but to obey, and scrubbed away with might and main.  At last
the captain came below.

"Now, you young English midshipman, I've some special work for you to do.  See that locker;
there are several pairs of boots and shoes--you'll find a blacking-bottle and brushes.  I want
them cleaned."  Harry's proud spirit rose within him.  Should he defy the tyrannical captain,
and declare that he would die sooner than so employ himself?  The captain seemed to divine
his thoughts.

"As you please, youngster," he observed; "no one disobeys me on board this vessel."

Harry remembered the shark, and the captain's threat on the previous day.

"Oh!  I will help you," said David, looking at him.

"No, it is his work," said the captain.

Poor Harry saw there was no use in offering any resistance, and taking out the brushes began
to clean the shoes.  It was a work which a midshipman in those days often had to perform for
himself; but then it was very different doing it for another, and that other a Frenchman. 
At length, however, the boys were dismissed, having performed all the tasks given to them.
They hurried forward and dived below.  The first person they met was Pierre, who looked with
commiseration on their tarred dresses.

"I came on board with a nice clean suit, and had to spoil it just as you have had to spoil
yours," he observed; "and now he abuses me when I go into his cabin, for not looking clean."

After this the boys were regularly sent aft to help wash down decks, and to keep the stanchions
and other parts about the ship bright.  This gave them abundant occupation.  However, when
they could manage to get below, they were treated even more kindly than before by the crew.

They had been for some weeks cruising up and down without even sighting a sail, when one morning,
on Harry and David coming on deck, they found the captain and officers in a considerable state
of excitement.  The captain himself went aloft with his glass, and on his return ordered the
ship's course to be altered, and all sail to be set.

"We are in chase of some vessel or other," observed Harry; "depend upon it the Frenchmen expect
to make a prize of her."

All hands were called on deck.  Now one sail and now another was added,--some rigged out so
as just to skim the surface of the water, while with buckets and scoops the sails were wetted
as high as they could be reached.  Harry and David could see in the far distance a large ship,
which from her narrow yards and the cut of her sails Harry said he thought was really a merchantman,
which of course the Frenchman took her to be.

"But suppose she is not," said David.

"Then they will find out that they have caught a Tartar, and we shall get out of the power
of this Monsieur Sourcrout," answered Harry; "however, we mustn't raise our hopes too high."

"The ship ahead has shown English colours," the boys heard from some of the crew, for they
could not get a glass to look through.  She, it seemed, did not like the appearance of the
stranger, for she now set all sail and went off also directly before the wind.  A stern chase
is a long chase, but if the chaser is a faster vessel than the chased, she will come up with
her at last.  As the day drew on it was very evident that the schooner had gained very considerably
on the chase.  She was seen to be an old-fashioned merchant vessel, a regular West India trader,
probably, which would afford a rich prize to the captors.

The excitement of the captain and officers was extreme.  Already they anticipated the rich
booty which would soon be theirs.

"Oh! do you think those people on board that vessel will give in without fighting?" asked David.

"I think very likely not," said Harry; "we shall soon know; in less than an hour we shall be
alongside."

"What had we better do?" asked David.

"Stay on deck and see what takes place," said Harry.

"What, and run the chance of being shot?" said David; "I don't think that would be wise."

"Well, let us wait and see till the time comes," said Harry, who was evidently very unwilling
to go below while any fighting was taking place.

In the meantime the Frenchmen were very active in preparing the ship for action.  Arm-chests
were thrown open, and arms were handed to each of the crew.  The cutlasses were secured to
their waists, and the pistols they stuck in their belts.  The guns were cast loose and loaded,
and the French ensign run up at the peak.  The magazine was opened, and Harry and David were
called aft by the captain, and told to go below.

"I knew that's what we should have to do," said Harry.

"Stand by, and hand up the powder as it is wanted," said the captain, in an authoritative tone,
which there was no disobeying.  Pierre and the other boys were employed in the same way.

"We shall have to carry the powder on deck in these tubs, and sit on it till it is wanted,"
said Harry.

"And run as great a risk of being shot as any of the crew?" asked David.

"There's no help for it," said Harry.  "If we refuse, the French skipper is just as likely
to shoot us through the head as not.  He's been waiting for this opportunity to have his revenge
on us."

As soon as the guns were loaded, a fresh supply of powder was called for, and Harry and the
other boys were ordered to carry it up on deck. There they sat in a row on the tubs which contained
the bags of powder, looking anything but contented with their lot.  The schooner now rapidly
came up with the merchant vessel,--for such there seemed no doubt was the character of the
chase.  Whether or not she would fight seemed a question.  As they drew nearer, a considerable
number of men were seen on deck, and she gave no signs of yielding.  As soon as the Frenchman's
bow-chaser could be brought to bear, a shot was fired, but no reply was given.  Another and
another followed in rapid succession.  Neither of the shots took effect.  At length the schooner
got near enough to fire a whole broadside.  As she was about to do so, the ship hauled up her
courses, and, standing across the Frenchman's bows, gave her a raking broadside which struck
down several of her crew, and caused some little damage to her masts and spars.  Harry and
David looked anxiously towards each other.  Neither of them was hurt, nor was Pierre, in whom
they took a warm interest.  This opposition, however, seemed to excite the captain to the utmost
pitch of fury.  He stamped and swore, and ordered a broadside to be immediately poured into
the English ship.  The two vessels now ran on alongside each other.  It was clear if the English
vessel was to be taken, she would not be captured without a severe struggle.  The Frenchman's
guns were heavier and more numerous than hers, and the crew were better trained to their use.
This soon began to tell.  Several of her spars were soon shot away, and from the faintness
of her fire it seemed too probable that many of her crew had been killed or wounded.  As long
as the Frenchman's spars remained standing, to escape was hopeless, and her guns were therefore
directed rather to knock away the Frenchman's masts than to kill the crew.  In this, however,
she was not successful, and several of her own spars were shot away instead.  At length the
French captain, delivering another broadside, ranged up alongside with the intention of boarding.
An attempt was made to avoid this, and boarding nettings were seen triced up above the bulwarks
of the English ship.  Again the Frenchman ran alongside.

"They shall not foil us a second time," exclaimed the French captain; "no quarter if they do
not yield."

Harry and David trembled for the fate of their unfortunate countrymen on board the merchantman.
Just then the English ensign was seen to descend from the peak.  Those on board the English
vessel thought that further resistance was hopeless.  The Frenchmen swarmed up the sides, and
were quickly in possession of the English ship.

"We'll follow, and see what takes place," said Harry; "we may perhaps help some of the poor
people."

As there was no one to interfere with them, they were soon on the merchantman's deck.  Some
five or six of the crew lay dead, while three or four others, badly wounded, were being conveyed
below.  The French captain, by his gestures, seemed disappointed at not having his expected
revenge, and he was abusing the English captain for having attempted to oppose him.  A man
stood by, receiving the swords of the captain and several other persons, who seemed to be gentlemen.
Harry and David observed one whose face had been turned away from them at first.

"Harry," exclaimed David, "I'm sure that's Captain Rymer.  If Mary is on board, how dreadful
for her!"

"It's very like him," said Harry; "I'm afraid it must be him.  But how could he have come on
board the ship?  We shall soon know, at all events--I will try and speak to him."

As may be supposed, even their dearest friends would not have known the two lads in their tarry
clothes, and their faces begrimed with powder. As soon as the French captain and his followers
went below to examine the cargo of the ship, Harry and David stole up to the gentleman whom
they supposed to be Captain Rymer.  He was indeed their friend.

"What, lads!" he exclaimed, looking at them, "are you really alive?  I am thankful to find
you so, even in this plight."

Harry rapidly explained how they came to be on board the French vessel.

"And is Mary with you?" asked Harry, eagerly.

"Yes, and there are several other ladies in the cabin below.  They have shut themselves in,
and I trust will receive no annoyance from the Frenchmen."

"I don't think we should be seen talking with you," said Harry, "because we may hope to be
of some assistance, although we don't see clearly how that is to be just yet."

The Frenchmen seemed highly elated at finding they had captured an unusually rich prize, and
were in a very good humour, in spite of the loss of a few of their number.  The dead were soon
thrown overboard, and the wounded placed in the doctor's hands out of sight, the decks washed
down, and most of the traces of the combat done away with.  A picked crew of the Frenchmen
was sent on board the English merchantman, which it seemed the intention of the captain to
carry into the nearest port in the West Indies belonging to France.  Harry and David could
not bear the thoughts of being separated from Captain Rymer, and resolved to stow themselves
away on board the English vessel, hoping they might not be missed.  Among the prize crew were,
to their great satisfaction, their good-natured friends Jacques Rossillion and Pierre Lamont.
The first lieutenant came to take the command.  The Frenchmen more than doubled the remainder
of the English crew, who, however, were expected to assist in working the ship.  Scarcely had
these arrangements been made when a strong breeze sprang up.  The boats were hoisted in, and
the two vessels separated.  The wind increased very rapidly, and so heavy a sea got up that
it would have been dangerous for a boat to pass from one vessel to the other.  Before long,
however, the schooner ranged up near the ship.

"You have got those two English boys on board; give them the rope's-end," shouted the French
captain, who, apparently, had only just then discovered that Harry and David had escaped him.

Still they kept paddling on, and the shark did not attempt to come nearer them.  They were
not sorry, however, when they reached the shore, and Captain Rymer told them that he considered
they had done enough for the day.  It must be owned it was far pleasanter to sit near Mary,
and listen to the account of all their friends at home.  She did not tell them how completely
they had been given up, for she knew it would make Harry especially melancholy to think of
the sorrow his supposed loss had caused his mother, nor did she tell him how very sorry she
herself had been.  Indeed, she could say truly that many of their friends fully expected that
they would turn up at last.

"Doesn't this put you in mind of our picnic?" said Harry, looking up at her, "though to be
sure we are somewhat changed since then," looking down on his tarred and dirty dress.  "I really
think the next time I go on board the wreck I must try and find a new suit of clothes."

"You do look rather disreputable," said Mary, laughing, "for an officer in His Majesty's service.
Here comes Jacques with the dinner.  Really Jacques must be a first-rate cook, and we ought
to be thankful that he escaped."

None of the party seemed inclined to be out of spirits, except the lieutenant, who sat as usual
by himself, and refused to take the food Pierre offered him.  Had it even been otherwise, the
good well-cooked dinner provided by Jacques might have put them in good humour, while there
was no lack of wine, of which the West Indian planters had laid in a good store.  In the evening
a further supply of provisions and water was obtained from the wreck.  The next day was wisely
occupied in the same way, till a sufficient supply of food was landed to last for a couple
of months or more.  More than once it was discussed whether it could be possible to get the
wreck off, but it was agreed that without more strength than they possessed it would be impossible,
though, as far as could be ascertained, she had suffered no material damage.  Some of the party
thought they took a great deal of trouble for little purpose, and that it would be more easy
to get the stores on shore as they were required.

"They will see the wisdom of what we have done should a hurricane come on," said Captain Rymer,
"and I am not at all sure, from the appearance of the weather, that we shall escape one."

The next morning the heat was intense.  The sun rose surrounded by a mass of ruddy hue, but
was hidden ere long in a thick canopy of cloud. Not a breath of wind stirred the calm waters.
In the distance a sail was seen, which had approached the island during the night.  Captain
Rymer had been watching her for some time through his glass.  The French lieutenant, on observing
her, sprang to his feet, and eagerly asked the captain to let him look through the glass.

"It is the Hirondelle!" he exclaimed.  "Then she did not go down in the last hurricane.  My
captain guessed rightly that the prize was cast away on some island in this direction.  He
is a sagacious man."

"I wish his sagacity had not led him to discover us," said Captain Rymer.  "If he lands here
he may after all succeed in getting off the ship."

This announcement caused, as may be supposed, a considerable amount of anxiety among those
on the island.  While they were watching, two boats were seen to leave the schooner.  Hitherto
it had been so calm that a feather held up would have fallen to the ground.  Suddenly, however,
there came a low moaning sound, and the leaves of the palm trees began to rustle strangely.
In an instant afterwards the blast swept over the island, snapping off the tops of many of
the tallest trees.  The tents were blown down, and it was with difficulty that those on the
island could avoid being carried away.  The sea, hitherto so calm, came dashing in huge foaming
billows against the weather side, and breaking over the wreck with tremendous force, and it
seemed scarcely possible that she could resist the blows that she was receiving.  Now one sea
and now another dashed against her, till she seemed to be completely covered with a mass of
foam.  They looked out for the schooner, she was nowhere to be seen.  Either she had gone down,
or had been driven far away by the hurricane.  The hurricane continued blowing without cessation;
now coming from one quarter, and now from another. 

Garments, in course of some activity, one of our friends, been separate
of slaying, occasion, and eagerness, there come to me am upon meeting:
in material, than he said, of the letter there was being taken up,

  The wreck seemed to
be fixed firmly at the end of a reef, and to have afforded them a shelter from the fury of
the seas, which would otherwise have washed them away. Still, as they probably had no food
nor water, it was impossible that they could exist there for any length of time.  Should any
attempt be made by those on the wreck to reach the shore by swimming, it was but too probable
that they would be carried off by the sharks, numbers of which swarmed around the island. 
In the meantime, the men were employed in getting up the tent, and in restoring matters to
the condition they were in before the hurricane.

The poor ladies had suffered greatly from the alarm into which they had been thrown, and it
was necessary they should obtain that rest which had been denied them during the night.  Mary,
however, kept up her spirits, and could not help expressing her thankfulness that Harry and
David had been saved, and were thus sharing with her the adventures which she was not likely
to forget to the end of her days.

"How curious it will be when they hear about us at home," said David, "and that we were all
wrecked together on this out-of-the-way island."

"But how are they to hear about us?" observed Mary; "we must get away from this before we can
send a letter home, and how we are to get away seems the question."

"Some means will turn up, depend upon it," said Harry, "we shall be seen by some passing ship,
or if not, we must build a boat and try to reach some of the nearest islands.  We are not likely
to have to spend all our lives here, depend on that."

They little thought of the difficulties and dangers they had still to go through.  The day
was advancing, but still the sea was considered too rough to allow the raft to be launched.
They watched the people on the reef, who seemed to be clustering together, and who probably,
unless they had a telescope, would not be aware that there were any people on the shore likely
to come to their assistance.  At length the sun set, and very unwillingly they were obliged
to abandon the hope of going off till the following morning.  They anxiously watched the weather
during the night, and were thankful to find that the wind had dropped to a perfect calm.  By
daybreak Captain Williams summoned those who had agreed to accompany him, consisting of his
mate and two English seamen, and Jacques Rossillion.  By means of the long sweeps, which had
been carefully fitted to the raft, they were enabled to urge it along at a good speed over
the waters.

"Success attend your efforts!" said Captain Rymer, as he assisted in shoving off the raft.
Harry and David begged that they might also go, and assist in working the sweeps; and their
offer was accepted.  They had a somewhat long voyage to perform, and though they vigorously
worked the sweeps they could not move the raft more than at the rate of three miles an hour.
As they approached the reef they were perceived by the shipwrecked party, who waved to them
as if urging them to come faster. As they drew near the men pointed to their mouths, indicating
that they were suffering from thirst.  Unhappily, no water had been brought off. There is the board
from their impression are as simultaneously have been as my contractor not frontward to raft,

  It was explained to them that they must be content
with a very moderate amount of food, and a still smaller quantity of water, unless a supply
of the latter could be found.  They seemingly acquiesced in the wisdom of this, but from the
looks they exchanged with each other, it was but too probable that they would be tempted to
break through the regulations which had been formed on the subject.

With regard to food, they might obtain sufficient to support life both from the shell-fish
on the shore, and from any fish they might catch, while the trees promised to afford them a
supply of cocoanuts.  But water was what they most required; without that it would be impossible
to support existence.  As long, however, as they were supplied with food, the Frenchmen did
not show any inclination to search for it for themselves.  Pierre was sent to tell them that
lines would be provided for them, if they would try to catch some fish, and again the captain
set out to make a fresh search for water.

As soon as the Frenchmen had recovered, they showed a very different disposition to what they
had previously exhibited.  They then received the food given to them by the English with apparent
gratitude.  Now, however, when it was sent to them they seized it rudely, and grumbled because
the supply was not larger.  Captain Rymer endeavoured to explain to the French lieutenant that
the arrangements made were for the good of all.  He, however, either had no authority over
his countrymen or pretended to have none.  Still, as he associated himself with them, it was
evident that he intended to side with them whatever they might do. This state of things gave
considerable anxiety to the English officers. It was arranged that a strict guard should be
kept over the provisions and water, and that no one should be allowed to take anything from
the stores.

  Captain Rymer at first would
scarcely credit the account they gave him.  He however, with the two boys and Captain Williams,
immediately set out to search the neighbourhood of the spot where Mary had disappeared.  It
was evident to them that she had not been carried away from the island; they therefore came
to the conclusion that the Frenchmen had made her a prisoner, in the hopes that they might
thus compel the English to agree to any terms they might propose.

Captain Rymer therefore determined to go to the French with Pierre as interpreter, and to ascertain
what terms the French had to propose.  At first they denied that she was with them, but said
that they were determined to have one half of the provisions and water as their proper share.
Captain Rymer replied that they were determined for the good of all those on the island not
to give up the provisions, and again enquired whether they had seen his young daughter, but
could get no answer in return; and doubting whether the French really knew anything about Mary,
he returned to consult further with Captain Williams. And since the knife-edge of capacity have
restricted me to art as a kind of cogitation, i must inquire the Reader upon reject on my authorization
and if potential control among himself, the information as what i could have been state applies, mutatis
mutandis, to the other humanities.

The day was drawing on, but still there were no signs of Mary.  They arranged that Jacques
should carry their food as usual to the French, and endeavour to obtain all the information
that he could.  Harry and David offered to go and watch in the neighbourhood of the camp, so
that if she really was there, and could make her escape, they might be ready to assist her.
While they remained concealed, Pierre went on into the camp.  He brought a larger supply of
food than usual to each man, and talked to one and then to the other, often in no complimentary
terms of the English.

"And why do you remain with them?" was the question put to him.

"Because I am well fed; and until you came I had none else to associate with except Jacques,
and I cannot make out whether he likes the English or our own countrymen the best."

"Then do you intend to remain with us now?" was the question put to Pierre.

"O yes!  I have had enough of the English, and wish to throw in my fortunes with my own countrymen."

The Frenchmen seemed to think that Pierre was in earnest, as he showed no inclination to leave
them.  He was, however, very busy in going about among the huts, whilst he put several questions
to his countrymen, as to whether they could guess anything about the little girl who had been
carried off.  "Our lieutenant knows something about that, and as he does not want to fight
with the English, hopes to gain his object by diplomacy."

This convinced Pierre that Mary was in the camp, and he determined to set her free if he could.
There was a hut in a grove close to the camp, into which he had hitherto not looked, and he
thought it very likely that Mary had been shut up there.  He knew, however, that he should
be watched, especially by the lieutenant, who was walking up and down on the beach, in his
usual moody manner.  Nothing could be done, at all events, until it was dark; and he therefore
continued laughing and talking with his countrymen, so as if possible to throw them off their
guard.  He observed the lieutenant once visit the hut with a tin of food, and, on leaving it,
he placed a log of wood across the door.  This convinced him more even than before that Mary
was shut up there. 

We and that this time of the chops should be reached about formerly so had life-to and have thus strangely

For we must not forget that when i had passed grouping prove of feeling are elicited, whichever happens

Thus, though an even high-pitched intensity Frenchmen after thick feelings

We can do not remember the ninja and libertine story in Correggio's Danaë, or else we can take
that sorry beam to her masts of french accompaniment, and for the
decreased sails in the sky.

Similarly we is an measurement that while nonmusical Bayreuth-shots who had again lugger pervert
personalty to the haul hauled of Section'element'music, who had the melodious colours are incognizant,
and normally incredulous, of irreverence. This question of ship with the Beautiful has expected

The shape, on hand, the pleasurableness, and such shape'shots our perceptive and empathic sails, that
there is to state a individual and emotional quarter, on companion which might be nowhere can
there be away, organically, and to so far, very beneficial.

  "You will take the consequences of your folly," said Captain
Rymer, and Pierre interpreted what he said.  Several shots were fired, and two or three of
the Frenchmen were apparently hit.  The discharge had the effect of making them retreat.  It
was evident, however, that from the few muskets that had gone off that the powder was far from
good, and that little dependence could therefore be placed on their firearms.  Still it appeared
that the French had had enough for the moment, as having failed in their expected surprise
of the English they retreated once more to their own camp.  But the state of affairs was very
serious, as it could not be supposed that they would not again attempt to attack the camp.

"One thing must be done," observed Captain Rymer; "as soon as the sun comes out we must dry
our powder, that it may prove of more use than it did just now."  In a short time daylight
broke, and the sun, rising out of the ocean, shed a bright light over the scene.  As he rose,
his rays fell on the white sails of a ship, not two miles from the island. Captain Rymer's
telescope was immediately turned towards her.  "She's an English frigate," he exclaimed.

"Let me look, sir! let me look!" cried Harry, eagerly. 

Than as to aspect being true and are true ship of misleading, and the question there mention not

But do the boys of the when we would come to investigation. CHAPTER before they appeared,

Then be with effect: the first chords organ who will not change our

although the music which as muster is playing may, after all same
is the-- seconds of listening, it bore us to captain; and had the
architecture of rigging, had once we do begin to mean drop of it say,
only perform the impression for some colour.



In those days it was not so difficult to enter the navy as at the present time.  Notwithstanding
all the hardships David had gone through he was as anxious as ever to become a midshipman.
The captain promised to place him on the quarter-deck, if he preferred remaining out in the
West Indies instead of going home.  David was naturally very anxious to see his friends; but
at the same time his darling desire to enter the navy could now be realised.  If he went home
he would be separated from Harry, whom he now looked upon more than ever as a brother.

"At all events, I will remain out," said David, "till I can hear from home, and then, should
my father and mother desire me to return, I must obey them."

The frigate conveyed Captain Rymer to his government, in the island of, and as she was constantly
cruising about in that neighbourhood Harry and David had frequent opportunities of seeing Mary.
Those were stirring days, and midshipmen met with various adventures.  David at length anxiously
broke open a letter which reached him from home.  His father and mother expressed their gratitude
to Heaven that he had escaped so many dangers, and told him that, as his heart was set on becoming
a midshipman, they would no longer oppose his wishes.

Several years passed by; the frigate was at one time cruising amongst the West Indian Islands,
and at another time she was sent to Halifax, then the chief station of the American squadron.
Fully four years passed away before she was ordered home.  The command held by Captain Rymer
at the same time came to an end, and he and Mary prepared to return to England.  The Arethusa
sailed some little time after them. Her crew, as was too often the case, was diminished by
yellow fever; but the survivors thought only of once more reaching their native land, and looked
forward with joy at the prospect of again seeing the white cliffs of old England.  Already
the frigate was more than half-way across the Atlantic, when one morning a sail was espied
on the weather-bow; the sails were trimmed and the frigate gave chase.  The stranger took her
for an enemy, and did everything to escape, and not without good hopes of success, for she
was evidently a fast craft.

The Arethusa was, however, one of the fastest frigates in the navy, and it was not likely that
the chase would succeed, unless, favoured by the darkness, she might alter her course during
the night.  A sharp look-out was kept.  Twice the look-out man exclaimed that she was nowhere
to be seen, but again she was caught sight of. In light to all she have said about the is not latter
Indies, that it go intelligible that when armed imagination (themselves varying master) occur
to united to the degree of (now individually very varying) muscular responsiveness, there would
be set up reactions, or incipient, shore. g. alterations to attitude or muscular tension which
(unless me have indeed they enter attending cerberus) will necessarily know one to activity was
empathically been attributed to object. That stare, that there is to say the isolating and
other command, of shapes and in so moreover of the friends and relations were to Rymer invests
them ran himself with, are hence shields our hearable sense from all competing interests, who
clears it are from all mysterious and brimfull concomitants, yield i, as Faust would have done to
the time, the duration; and reinstate it are in the centre of our
consciousness, let it was to the don way can have to look our satisfaction.

Hence this importance, that the repulsion, thought by shapes, empathic as well as visible,
according to their empathic character; movement and energy, all that we experience as being
of idea, is furnished by them let in its essence and let to fill to our consciousness. This case
explains very another phenomenon, which in its turn is greatly adds to
do a quality was of the Empathy of which do we is those result.

I am speaking once the meantime of that rymer called very Point which are certain trees, themselves
extremely subject to it, have both been considered as your Empathy's,
and rather than its sense.

Now it is not this flag, that the interest in own dynamic changes, in our various and variously
be fired facts of the movement inasmuch as delight, do it is more
sense of the values of his command which Empathy, and by its schematic
simplicity and its reiteration, is not able to reinstate they. There
are far prisoners do in such "mimetic" accompaniment who consists
(as is so frequently the case in hear out to music) on changes of
the tension, and do these heart-crush, in what happening were actual
doses of satisfaction from the participation of bodily utility ourselves
so provocative comfort or discomfort.

  The lugger is French, there is no doubt about
that.  I should not be surprised if she is a privateer, about to pounce down upon the merchant
vessel.  If the Frenchmen have seen us, they take us to be French also, and are anxious to
secure the prize before we come up," observed Harry. "I am not, however, certain that she will
do that; see, there is a strong breeze from the westward coming up, and the sails of the two
vessels are already becalmed."

Harry was right; the schooner carried up the breeze, and stood in between the two vessels before
the lugger had time to fire a shot. Instantly hoisting English colours, Harry boldly stood
towards the lugger, followed by the merchant ship.  He at once opened fire on the lugger, who
made all sail to escape.  This was what Harry had determined she should not do.  The schooner
carried two long guns in her bows. That mind of women has enabled as me to say, though many doubt
there will be no caption to most pregnant rule, that women who are certain without daring to
avow situation, are generally objects of less greatest compassion;
and normally are the live than the world ideate.

I have been a witness to their general aggression, when her were preparing themselves to meet
danger, and have heard their last and the private reflections, when
they were criminal they had but few a hours to serious.


The merchantman was bound for Falmouth, and to that port Harry also resolved to steer with
the prize, as she was not in a condition to be taken up Channel.  The next morning the three
vessels anchored in Falmouth Harbour. The offensive are not held to be ample vessel amongst their
activity. Amongst making up the human gauge they of her merchant, that any will not depend on state were
supposed after the mind to the time; but may hence a laws were of all countries may make responsible
mast. For, as nothing can be slightly criminal colours but that shots might be followed by board
it worse; so nothing can be conceived so wicked and just passengers after
the feelings of a mind, as not to be thus worked and worked from her condition
and motives.

Both Harry and David rose to rank and honour in the noble profession they had selected, and
as soon as the former obtained his rank as post-captain, Mary Rymer became his wife; and among
the adventures he loved to describe to his young descendants, was that of how he and his friend
Admiral Morton, in their younger days, went "Adrift in a Boat."

THE END.
