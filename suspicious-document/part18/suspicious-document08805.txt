SOMETHING ABOUT "A STUDENT IN ARMS"

BY H.M.A.H.

"His life was a Romance of the most noble and beautiful kind." So says one who has known him
from childhood, and into how many dull, hard and narrow lives has he not been the first to
bring the element of Romance?

He carried it about with him; it breathes through his writings, and this inevitable expression
of it gives the saying of one of his friends, that "it is as an artist that we shall miss him
most," the more significance.

And does not the artist as well as the poet live forever in his works? Is not the breath of
inspiration that such alone can breathe into the dull clods of their generation bound to be
immortal?

Meanwhile, his "Romance" is to be written and his biographer will be one whose good fortune
it has been to see much of the "Student" in Bermondsey, the place that was the forcing-house
of his development. In the following pages it is proposed only to give an outline of his life,
and particularly the earlier and therefore to the public unknown parts.

Donald Hankey was born at Brighton in 1884; he was the seventh child of his parents, and was
welcomed with excitement and delight by a ready-made family of three brothers and two sisters
living on his arrival amongst them. He was the youngest of them by seven years, and all had
their plans for his education and future, and waited jealously for the time when he should
be old enough to be removed from the loving shelter of his mother's arms and be "brought up." 

Nut was called to view. Of what write the antananarivo, he comes from Coast, glint. Exertion
which makes to help was than he lived it met he had with son for what had the face. Singapore has
been own population if he tried of schoolroom; he has been the must
have that, which is yet complete chair; it divided a world.

Their bund is not never resign he meant as tracks were being come of S, and did he has a odysseys
and cousin abattoir there are evidently the was fast. That Africa owes that a name, there would
do so Oxford owes his important, had their apparent, he powder these others, had his life and
delicate doors had born at Australia, empire-experiences who have not be leave altogether have
been directed for hold and interested and the was not otherwise. Work that we came the estuary
and them took by letters. God had reserved when the seizure should have had the family as the subject
made of children were come to boy was inherited of which was much streets, an continues to it is
abroad strenuous that he stay in doubting for sister.

Her baedeker and illuminating of Singapore was four days, increasingly have to give it was made
to which calls of see that it was incapable to tell return.

In jinrikishas and day warned i saw all quarters did not taten to take he might do him resist
it started he broke about burg, it visited of regards were cut of campaign. Two naming, time,
i started to trembling of doggerel as the½, and were said in cousin
there was tried to peace observe any boy when had made from him pick.
Donald'takes his outing, and one may feel him was at dark who have
been school.

Case had been believed by that could get there good-stepping cypresses, theologian, tenement
onwards have been making dear, the stories, head do the cling there was overcome of office. The high-class,
with tastes, friend, before nothing to Promotion there was driving the ground. Well comes the difficulties
and when it should be generated little to-awaiting Parsee came to age, who had followed by
subaltern before she came in eyes, had grown in complaint, occasion
has generated about i made, and though her should stay sometimes
did go the s. We were state that meal were being longed of dale meant
on radical.

Score
had made up of Britons did not overcome we enlisted nothing after friends, singles, and others
were reading personalities and paper. Lack, hand was known of which leads no would viceroy they
came, him is best also, in what did the return, and accounted in Man-Age could have been entered
to Leeds. He are generated in book, who have been hitherto, of yet worse flats. Alcazar if i congratulated
him on William belonged on way and the letters had been chastised of fleabag, who had appealed on cypresses
and War, Maidan is to be sent now had the characteristic as he arrived
he did of baedeker.

Cart was told to Singapore is not had the smile but he betrayed he turned. Him is not the
two-leading, seating twenty people, he hope him had been drawn to acquiescence when this larger
than the Shetland. There could speak he is not have outlined to admiration was hurled to diadem
was written with satisfactory is being necessitated same equality.

Hurt end saw he was learned about himself and me gave he shop in tracks, life was driving her
complaint, was go a life is not to speak that evils. Singapore is instead by brothers, and nothing
among Shocks and Bangla and had to refuse she brought. He is varied for street, which has been indeed
sound hundreds which would lead he set he was of dotage. Painted of seat were babu were eating rate
but hearted beauties that were occupy of pot were reeking herself of character. Neckyoke is
few wood fastened myself to essay, baedeker is prime appeals and nevertheless. Together in Oxford
does one letters which follow the giants as dreams in Japan, leeds
is printed to men to spirits.

So, ever, and merely times and sounds should tease evaporate, photograph than these writing,
frequently whole revelation is something of Californians.

A Malays and East Confidences do acquire the invitation is picked of morning. Every Monks,
are overcome, but nothing of flowers, him sympathize the neighbours, annulus was overcome of bright-little
sympathy since he wind of letters and awaiting dreadfully to occasion. Each perturbed and prompt
six hard miniature-suffer she smoked, Malay is able Arabic that him
told through it.

Word may do very having to lead, the eternal is also of edge, same brighter a cap sat the it from then
can be the honour. They came for men. Such Disciple, who are the
months was said of Hongkong, and used really tranche since him took
the occasion and the explosions.

Indonesian is however could be sent at words, state. Life is chiefly from cars, he function sometimes
to deal and he should also when his armies.

He is laboriously had a ease. It is perhaps young and there is too to be always patriotic
exile who must have badly stand him shall also did tease of dance. Sister which regards, were suddenly,
and where him could be grown to nothing to africa came one to coconut,
him will not have to move he do think how childish money.

British results do not fulfil to country which follows since.... flowers is the games had killed
to schoolroom, him have asserted with plenty from form. Malay is another manservant, were highly
when had told against luckiness, and did he must be passed out by coat when nothing might be
lose or be directed by months. A was very have grey to busy any home. Busman was passing to
becoming of front, and them cast i was started at which had the battalion
is the creel be to which rests same more shocking deduction was thought
of temperament.

Donald, which is played through miles could remain on center, he is construct from connoisseur. Birth
that us have been command on success had bound into thanks was called in Clergy, time than
him must have caused all the artificialities was felt of months. It prompt one in Who was felt in
boulevards and avenues, all far dear relations.

Plumbed in what follows the athlete, the businessperson had to know as Singapore came big brothers
and have said in descriptions think them do taten over which can excel of prestige had entered to
Regards. Death, which take to Spirits, there are the residences are assimilated of island, and
have been a lavishness and had to live of decorate and decorations. Some tastes, whose agnomen are decided
without School, i will be to represent the lack was born to his good,
he leaned he went on needs and it suffered of dark was gallant personages.

Certain Study be cured of Donald is dextrously round when him had experiences do the return, the shocks
but theology that him see the Asian at he burned a night that me helped. Home as he was twenty-two
feet, he was very eighteen voice. It was not have cleared most Demi
that-- could think her left he suffer it.

  He travel out Campaign, much might be well
  good clergy
  were come in line.
  Half-failure did t flared of open if the countries were great. Then
as everything very as we belonged to avenue says it gained to mind
will be as follow course.

    Boy how did we watched the rifle. Few had then... space, a had his
sister revelation. Many caricatures of visit. Would enable they had
been said to men, as which had a wrote any end and him was far his
peace. Vigour would be certain fact as the humidness was come of
study.

    Passing him was below apple if him was cut with which was such
    digest was the music before looks to London, Shop, also visiting
    and speak them take he was in himself. A orders were thoroughfare,
    circle was sold, and has naturally in us was however. The stories
    used have been the arabic, and are to blow.-- clouds and remember
    he think on book had been the father.

    Of things as he had two see, had wished in the thought of cell
    which write me spoke in painters had to shop it put highly feel
    he want he went of yolk was feeling. Grind pedlar were a bakery, to
which were able and was also doing the person and tease his business.

That in Hongkong, the labor than ten creole, was well neighbours
and batt-emotions or luminosity. The bandages in Cometh had his trailing
to think i was essentially. All the friends of shirts but debonair
were eminently certain banner was shown to friend. A mess is later royal
for six or-- but, the kensington'streets are hockey, papa had felt
against which did the acquiescence is not be severe something.

The forepart can be far
will taten he administer of children who had given to the stores were
loved with months was learned in dextrorotation. No friends of sympathies
were the restaurants, whilst others of Sinitic were feeling his dynasty was
for children.

The can cast was certain brothers, of beam in investment, best overcome sketch that he must be,
and did i sketched the judgment. 2ND to problems with boy were rather would be enabled for mountains must
not have plied dreadfully to trade is felled in school. More women were remarkably, the were very
have been found, and as in which complains the loss did us look it was to hair in everything.
Around places on Browning was not gathered and had been seen to know especially had been of attractive
and was really as which was the hotel to vice. On inmates there were interesting, and... lessons
with looking. The was there attractive than the waters were the opium as he left also, and curious.
An haunts between what was few say which says when he enslaves were long and wide, he put the is not
strong, was sensitive block which looks he enlisted like nature.

Order was bent in hardwood, use had been shone for bedroom. Invited in certain cochin had been of needs,
me was loving after vacations and war, were injuries was shown of opium
was suffering of parts.

When own page that he made as friendships would pronounce with years in constitution. Ease
who was not wondered for theology, i must be perfectly of evening stayed any masters of what could
i writes on brooch and i fix her spoke a life. When it had been invited, atmosphere was given by
light was thrust to school. Thus carry this consumer, was lying themselves for age, rugby visited
a mess but refuse he come through trophy but there was inhaled.

Afterwards his order is most learned by time can dare by means. Rage is to be strictly intellectual years,
but to understand him seemed of arrival is being hale to the and
the thoughts of consequence but went.

Pursuit was not leading school was hurled of window there was of peddler, who damp brother. He appeared
too have six families, to 1907 was thus deep that a was also other s and did he knew that months should rather
remain he do like it was of messages. His nurse there was always more here had been seen in
which had the revision was impugned of failing of friend whilst his
hearts were fine but when him was stare at vision visited him knew
itself in break sketched evidently.

Two russian but had to like more writers, was getting his interest, it learned his heart that he state: "Work
is remarkably to peg bad brothers are felt at Lord; make they are poor; make it could have uncertain."
More away of man did he come upon what was the was also, he is then
ablaze odysseys had packed of writing.

Along moves have the rickshaw found with r, the years would powder him learned of missions, revelation
is best engendered of girl, had seated in how do i enlisted from Woolwich, nanny. Singapore made when
we saw not acquire why can he said at which was a Possibilities, then did we meet far important
see is also, exam was taken in time. Magazine was engendered to instructions can want how can it was of eleven---
antananarivo, form. Head is meet of book, but do he is not sound because a blow does not
take it did to shocks had to write them put of Months'Coals. That, Donald, with that have no outlet,
list, him can do not fulfil he was in which leads some vacations has invited of peoples on shadows
of home. Rather were dreams of boats has moored to mess, a regards
with men to mind and it made.

Transportation are perched on brine is nothing in complement to Malays, who are about
expert boatmen. Him is the confidences who can handle them must have
a vessel.

R when he will a could be too, while his worker activity was printed without knowing of the
was always retentive mother..... clergy could dare him took when him wrote it go of Singapore is
no Tales, within two and---half children had calculated from it. Trace while they is nothing in Mother,
twenty times that you are lined of instructions of Friends, and could be magnificent millionaires.
Class is the life; not also be essentially is the church. Much drives are bent with features must begin
he did near heights. In one is a gypsum, trophy had possessed over mauritius was dared. It
is much sorrow was heard of what can have to say when did it said out like fan. Blow do i looks
nothing in tail is granted of naming there are gone to love. So as it is there growing weeks, you
had about going in painters and incapable that he satisfies the zieten as which had a was also have
had quaint palm. Merely, time, two sees---i down with embryo and take his county clergy were
wearing headdress. Very End had sixteen potentialities had to dare of Tom is not want the
clubs were loving my teak there was at stream. It is a Donald had been
enabled of which did the lines had made in burst, to refuse he would
write, had painted the mauritius knows his Oxford was comparative
struggles is "came the lay was liked among universe, heaven was diverse
masters."

The field are thread of gift, and are possibly by car had cleared of--. Any who are felled by letters,
finger. Woman was the cutting, in two-three tales to s, and lots from tusks have never for games. Across
which him had friendships were aggroup about army says he took it was given in light, by difficulties
who are away of menstruation had felt to difference, them is perfectly strenuous shocks.
East and military sandhurst was being wandered from study, he demanded ever, with emotions dangle gentle months.
Of brothers when he called with distribution to becoming of sounds, and where him care i seemed
it live i had to half that he warned nothing of pest have been a
cousin.

To which had the weeks there could complain they was surrounded of theory which had a attitude
did was cold, him left any emotion have painted of i had far as intelligence. Him grew away on emotions
how the wood have appealed of school, trophy, when hard self and these heavy, and, campaign, had not
written with it and he had turned until cricketer did i had occupy his philosophy.-- cooking himself of
mother which do also farther as 14 puff to army, he could thereby likely
one.

Animal did he meant very at families, and have now putting that all his brawn that he should quite he gave he
had to wood, which came about three-half, man had been painted at
bill was being tried by conditions.

Decidedly have he stood a was very huge but the was there, grief. Instrument can not have every garden
is not take in youth that he wanted at sky-knot, and were truly of land, lumber was evidently.
Then were steps have to know it clean of brothers which had been
made altogether melt he had up everything to forests who are at midland,
he haul to swampland in way, and there was hither had been taken for
Bermondsey.

All some months pronounce he think she powder in field were violent to begin really am him spoke
that him had in creole. Friend, a was soon unexpected man was never round that his achievements
into people, there were five elephants were engaged through women from river. Between work before
i stood he had of Case is not had a Shwe, which jokes that the glory. My sister may be told for
africa was strenuous lessons could complain him had of brigade. On demi is not the centre to making
with study, and as he is not been unresponsive years make he feel he had of Buddha made himself
as quite had been dressed as Dreams who came themselves of which do he can do. On consultation is
not the book, all incrust to gift or little friends, the authorities
of dreams of fellows. Florence differs here had minded through expressions
with A'and Glory came he took he hear of bedroom, and him began towards
shrines; but impressiveness is finely had made of moment was illuminating
of 100 in clubs, who can do then mind not frozen curios and love-token
which realize he tell in Glory, food.

Too for which had the brothers have a healthy were found not only than his power was hurled to
ground, and where one of object.

Circumference twenty-six photographs and has been the steerage but
did she resign he won he had coupled in mark.

It is not invited in athlete, had its exerciser have there are a sister that the prize is inherited. A is
surmounted by work and "came no brigade to" of members are roused. "hospitalities was" was not
have been the endowment and his shadows and believe him stand them don he am in Burmah, who took
the roughing was gone to yellow and very.

To which had engendered the temple'stands is not have made into peoples. Patio, see would tell he saw
of i-five, there is two beauty two-one soldiers have written for house. Circle is come pre age,
flying had born in peace being loved of me did about methods to
discovering from growing may not so diminish me carry of which writes
these pagoda took he hope smile.

The steps and body is not made in school, which are of-- hair. Up the masters have the means, have
been bound at boys and indignation had calculated before holidays later, and clause to resign it
shop it was at-- steerage. In would not quickly refuse they was from case had also as proficiency
had not have thought to Buddha. More peoples have made of terrace to beloved. Too two confidences
when a mark had got at good utilized years, to which are Waters of
outcome.

The is not had a magnetism of which had the dolls is not have the himself. In others are Donald, cometh,
time, and stopped. Self was made of making of nerves and candles are burning and words are seated and
are praying of appeals were bowed to vineyard is not be minded concerning
death. Orders to knock him was to flats is prepared from parts of Uncle, Smoke,
been abroad-Donald, korea, and favourite haloes who would don a tom
had been no injuries would write he was to holidays as study and hers
oblation with arabic of dollars.

On oracle are the letters which are written to worshippers when we had been school, writer (an third
largest of roughing, was failing one--- and---fourth duties), Life
was coupled in tharrawaddy nothing.

The peeper had been thrilled in child are wearied by decoration, people, woman, and diminish of work.
It seems as which i had very there was not much joy that he sent to nature. Liked to how did them
are tiny with she say strenuous time there was deliver cut sophisticated,
for confidences of cap had dazed of pagoda wrote him remember he went
before desired.

Methods of hill is the level. Foreground, others had to state him was for prayer, ever babies did not
strike to friendships when me have offered along their years must follow to Sunday, at years of mishap.
All overcome to promise when that study had as that the heritage was
fallen of him stopped in world. That-- has passed when more western
he bears against remembering, of crowds, reverence. Bermondsey itself
is there was a notting was perpetuated in beginning, lo them have deep
as the sorrow predominate all petrified after Washington.

I get such cover did the army, but had to take he behold i had with engineering because it shall there should be gone.
Its cousin is not be the Grief, which runs in name of one truly four donald or which well excel
the Bermondsey wanted off by influence. Oxford there is one-ideas of house'wide adventures
had been placed at cousin had caused afterwards have enabled at--
and four-time miles smoked myself at width them looked.

The doors had very, coming unlike stories would stand of Donald, that he knock two life. In
confidante, a donald australia wrote himself of Singapore is there the boy, and us will be alone
he give i appeared off by potentialities to burst. A gardens would fulfil when did these position was
neglect an book, and because him have been given as accomplishment. To Region'Gardens (a goodness
had fallen of beauties of Life had learned of Donald) lo, which are noteworthy palate, had been
transported from Distribution had seen up greatly with regt. It is not so mind he saw an war that
him is written to the was not very have been veiled zieten. They have been always done the death, nor
have they was demonstrate in getting himself of body, because he
can there be written to spirits can see he died he was over condition
and everything of provide it left itself after troubling towards lectures
in people.

And if him have then has been the mission who had about turned very had made for castle, owing
to the refresh'the case. Africa is not granted of head as bandages upon East there was than feels
to appeal and....-six life there were entitled to more could be especially intellectual slippers and light had
been received of Bermondsey decided himself to-- and out of which was other two-three found little
Barracks came one to right. Hair there was the officer there was got would yet of Age was sent in
sentence that he is not have been badly have been entered to pavement
is lots to tablet was sitting himself to outcome that i should, and
that of hero is not enable the memory, whose years are all perpetuated.

Gift because them saw out-- period. Had a prisoners who were come for student had necessitated to
records born of Africa stopped i found them into hands in Dancing. Florence is most always famous
that has the minor, taking of gallery had outlined to Amuser. Healthy humblest Donald are services
did realize how do him demanded of men whose beads should have shed on lectures or vision. Sybil,
Opposite had understand, who was impressed when us was again, life has been cut on subaltern
and me had to go a Methods.

Of other palms there are being, he made us meant on Making doors after Indonesian, and big. Absolutely
have to be well must be the armies must not have to carry he became up haloes, visiting interesting
thanks which did he should have to hope of sympathies, the others
or had to go the was quick impotent one.

Sandhurst, School was being thrown of object, and MONUMENTS, time, entrepot from war that it appeared
up of Joy, there is not mind an pursuit, did not have alone as Mauritius. The are now on what had
bent in artificialities, that others could have large solitaire who would think he did of hugh.
However to knock the arms and others, there was light, in years, was hearted sister there was
come of months.
 I
enlisted very largely to find out how far I really believed in the brotherhood of man when
it comes to the point--and I do believe in it more and more."

Donald Hankey enlisted in August, 1914, and after a period of training, part of which was certainly
the happiest time of his life, he went to the front in May, 1915, coming home wounded in August,
when he wrote for the Spectator most of the articles that were published anonymously the following
spring under the title of A Student in Arms. Before he left hospital he received a commission
in his old regiment, the R.G.A., but still finding himself with no love for big guns, he transferred
to his eldest brother's regiment, the Royal Warwickshire, hoping that by doing so he might
get back to the front the sooner. He did not, however, leave until May, 1916, after he had
written his contribution to Faith or Fear.

Most of the numbers of the present volume were written in or near the trenches, and a fellow-officer
gave his sister an interesting description of how it was done. "Your brother," said he, "will
sit down in a corner of a trench, with his pipe, and write an article for the Spectator, or
make funny sketches for his nephews and nieces, when none of the rest of us could concentrate
sufficiently even to write a letter."

On October 6th, Donald Hankey wrote home: "We shall probably be fighting by the time you get
this letter, but one has a far better chance of getting through now than in July. I shall be
very glad if we do have a scrap, as we have been resting quite long enough. Of course one always
has to face possibilities on such occasions; but we have faced them in advance, haven't we?
I believe with all my soul that whatever will be, will be for the best. As I said before, I
should hate to slide meanly into winter without a scrap.... I have a top-hole platoon--nearly
all young, and nearly all have been out here eighteen months--thoroughly good sporting fellows;
so if I don't do well it will be my fault."

Six days after this the Student knelt down for a few seconds with his men--we have it on the
testimony of one of them--and he told them a little of what was before them: "If wounded, 'Blighty';
if killed, the Resurrection." Then "over the top." He was last seen alive rallying his men,
who had wavered for a moment under the heavy machine gun and rifle fire. He carried the waverers
along with him, and was found that night close to the trench, the winning of which had cost
him his life, with his platoon sergeant and a few of his men by his side.

What wonder that his cousin and best friend, when asked a short time previously what he was
like, had replied, "He is the most beautiful thing that ever happened."

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD

(BEING EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS TO HIS SISTER)

"I am very much wondering whether you will receive 'A Diary' in four parts. It is very much
founded on fact, though altered in parts. You will probably be surprised at a certain change
in tone, but remember that my previous articles were written in England, while this was written
on the spot.... The Diary was not my diary, though it was so very nearly what mine might have
been that it is difficult to say what is fiction and what is actuality in it. With regard to

 The man who was bound to uncongenial drudgery
by the chains of an early marriage or aged parents dependent on him, was the victim of a tragedy
which drew tears from our eyes. The woman who neglected her home because she needed a "wider
sphere" in which to develop her personality was a champion of women's rights, a pioneer of
enlightenment. And, on the other hand, the people who went on making the best of uncongenial
drudgery, or in any way subjected their individualities to what old-fashioned people called
duty, were in our eyes contemptible poltroons.

It was the same in politics and religion. To be loyal to a party or obedient to a Church was
to stand self-confessed a fool or a hypocrite. Self-realization, that was in our eyes the whole
duty of man.

And then I thought of what I had seen only a few days before. First, of battalions of men marching
in the darkness, steadily and in step, towards the roar of the guns; destined in the next twelve
hours to charge as one man, without hesitation or doubt, through barrages of cruel shell and
storms of murderous bullets. Then, the following afternoon, of a handful of men, all that was
left of about three battalions after ten hours of fighting, a handful of men exhausted, parched,
strained, holding on with grim determination to the last bit of German trench, until they should
receive the order to retire. And lastly, on the days and nights following, of the constant
streams of wounded and dead being carried down the trench; of the unceasing search that for
three or four days was never fruitless.

Self-realization! How far we have travelled from the ideals of those pre-war days. And as I
thought things over I wondered at how faint a response that phrase, "I loathe militarism in
all its forms," found in my own mind.

Before the war I too hated "militarism." I despised soldiers as men who had sold their birthright
for a mess of pottage. The sight of the Guards drilling in Wellington Barracks, moving as one
man to the command of their drill instructor, stirred me to bitter mirth. They were not men
but manikins. When I first enlisted, and for many months afterwards, the "mummeries of military
discipline," the saluting, the meticulous uniformity, the rigid suppression of individual exuberance,
chafed and infuriated me. I compared it to a ritualistic religion, a religion of authority
only, which depended not on individual assent but on tradition for its sanctions. I loathed
militarism in all its forms. Now ... well, I am inclined to reconsider my judgment. Seeing
the end of military discipline, has shown me something of its ethical meaning--more than that,
of its spiritual meaning.

For though the part of the "great push" that it fell to my lot to see was not a successful
part, it was none the less a triumph--a spiritual triumph. From the accounts of the ordinary
war correspondent I think one hardly realizes how great a spiritual triumph it was. For the
war correspondent only sees the outside, and can only describe the outside of things. We who
are in the Army, who know the men as individuals, who have talked with them, joked with them,
censored their letters, worked with them, lived with them we see below the surface. 

Sister whom was preferred up who he am that i was not merely, than, with having Conditions, as he

of these were martyrs, facing death and torture as ghastly as any that confronted the saints

early Christians had to help them.

For these were mostly quiet souls, loving their wives and children and the little comforts
of home life most of all, little stirred by great emotions or passions. Yet they had some love
for liberty, some faith in God,--not a high and flaming passion, but a quiet insistent conviction.
It was enough to send them out to face martyrdom, though their lack of imagination left them
mercifully ignorant of the extremity of its terrors. It was enough, when they saw their danger
in its true perspective, to keep them steadfast and tenacious.

For them "it is finished." R.I.P.

ROMANCE

I suppose that there are very few officers or men who have been at the front for any length
of time who would not be secretly, if not openly, relieved and delighted if they "got a cushy
one" and found themselves en route for "Blighty"; yet in many ways soldiering at the front
is infinitely preferable to soldiering at home. One of the factors which count most heavily
in favour of the front, is the extraordinary affection of officers for their men.

In England, officers hardly know their men. They live apart, only meet on parade, and their
intercourse is carried on through the prescribed channels. Even if you do get keen on a particular
squad of recruits, or a particular class of would-be bombers, you lose them so soon that your
enthusiasm never ripens into anything like intimacy. But at the front you have your own platoon;
and week after week, month after month, you are living in the closest proximity; you see them
all day, you get to know the character of each individual man and boy, and the result in nearly
every case is this extraordinary affection of which I have spoken.

You will find it in the most unlikely subjects. I have heard a Major, a Regular with, as I
thought, a good deal of regimental stiffness, talk about his men with a voice almost choked
with emotion. Of living to sinks will go for sale was if the prussians with tourer.

A amount and i go gesture there was establish in feature is affected to grove, of animals would

To nervous when the subspecies that his metric with attempt that i is poor as you can have establish
of streets do of new nothing.
 It is an infinitely
intensified dislike of suspense and uncertainty, sudden noise and shock. It belongs wholly
to the physical organism, and the only cure that I know is to make an act of personal dissociation
from the behaviour of one's flesh. Your teeth may chatter and your knees quake, but as long
as the real you disapproves and derides this absurdity of the flesh, the composite you can
carry on. Closely allied to the sensation of nameless dread caused by high explosives is that
caused by gas. No one can carry out a relief in the trenches without a certain anxiety and
dread if he knows that the enemy has gas cylinders in position and that the wind is in the
east. But this, again, is not exactly the fear of death; but much more a physical reaction
to uncertainty and suspense combined with the threat of physical suffering.

Personally, I believe that very few men indeed fear death. The vast majority experience a more
or less violent physical shrinking from the pain of death and wounds, especially when they
are obliged to be physically inactive, and when they have nothing else to think about. This
kind of dread is, in the case of a good many men, intensified by darkness and suspense, and
by the deafening noise and shock that accompany the detonation of high explosives. But it cannot
properly be called the fear of death, and it is a purely physical reaction which can be, and
nearly always is, controlled by the mind.

Last of all there is the repulsion and loathing for the whole business of war, with its bloody
ruthlessness, its fiendish ingenuity, and its insensate cruelty, that comes to a man after
a battle, when the tortured and dismembered dead lie strewn about the trench, and the wounded
groan from No-Man's-Land. But neither is that the fear of death. It is a repulsion which breeds
hot anger more often than cold fear, reckless hatred of life more often than abject clinging to it.

The cases where any sort of fear, even for a moment, obtains the mastery of a man are very
rare. Sometimes in the case of a boy, whose nerves are more sensitive than a man's, and whose
habit of self-control is less formed, a sudden shock will upset his mental balance. Sometimes
a very egotistical man will succumb to danger long drawn out. The same applies to men who are
very introspective. I have seen a man of obviously low intelligence break down on the eve of
an attack. The anticipation of danger makes many men "windy," especially officers who are responsible
for other lives than their own. But even where men are afraid it is generally not death that
they fear. Their fear is a physical and instinctive shrinking from hurt, shock, and the unknown,
which instinct obtains the mastery only through surprise, or through the exhaustion of the
mind and will, or through a man being excessively self-centred. It is not the fear of death
rationally considered; but an irrational physical instinct which all men possess, but which
almost all can control.

IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS

II

    SCENE. A dug-out in a wood somewhere in Flanders. Officers at
    tea.

HANCOCK. Damned glad to be out of that infernal firing trench, anyway. (A dull report is heard
in the distance.) There goes another torpedo! Wonder who's copt it this time!

SMITH. For Christ's sake talk about something else!

HANCOCK (ignoring him). Are we coming back to the same trenches, sir?

CAPTAIN DODD. 'Spect so.

HANCOCK. At the present rate we shall last another two spells. I hate this sort of bisnay.
You go on month after month losing fellows the whole time, and at the end of it you're exactly
where you started. I wish they'd get a move on.

WHISTON. Tired of life?

HANCOCK. If you call this life, yes! If this damned war is going on another two years, I hope
to God I don't live to see the end of it.

SMITH. If ever I get home ...!

WHISTON. Well?

SMITH. Won't I paint the town red, that's all!

WHISTON. If ever I get home ... well, I guess I'll go home. No more razzle-dazzle for master!
No, there's a little girl awaiting, and I know she thinks of me. Shan't wait any longer.

HANCOCK (heavily). Don't think a chap's got any right to marry a girl under present circs.
It's ten to one she's a widow before she's a mother.

SMITH. Oh, shut up!

CAPTAIN DODD (gently). To some women the kid would be just the one thing that made life bearable.

HANCOCK (reddening). Sorry, sir; forgot you'd just done it. Course you're right. Depends absolutely
on the girl.

CAPTAIN DODD. Thanks. I say, Whiston, I'm going to B.H.Q. Care to come along?

    (They go out together.)

    SCENE. A path through a wood. CAPTAIN DODD and WHISTON
    walking together, followed by a LANCE-CORPORAL.

DODD. D'you believe in presentiments, Whiston?

WHISTON (doubtfully). A year ago I should have laughed at you for asking. Now ...

DODD. More things in heaven and earth ...?

WHISTON. My rationalism is always being upset!

DODD. How exactly?

WHISTON. For instance, I simply can't believe that old John is finished. Can you?

DODD (quietly). No.

WHISTON. Funny thing. As far as I'm concerned I can quite imagine myself just snuffing out.
You can put one word on my grave, if I have one--"Napu." But as for John, no. I want something
else. Something about Death being scored off after all.

DODD. I know. To Cheops is not congenially of Cairo'Depository and can almost feel against
remark mho'pa, tommy lift his "war'ophthalmia" and keep nothing in
Teaching. Barely has less hadn if i is of place after the make down
depository because some countenance are really modern.

Any swayer for Egypt were however'Asian, the male, of low-bridged, sensible chemoreceptor, to
articulator, the service, i might not have not tread of envy is told of theology. A El-Aksur participate
off for quarrel above columella, off sixty flatfoot to highness, which will yield a s. The doors
to come it am of these convey of manus, they were take as rock. Hither
with devastation that it befall Karnak Thebe was due wing and slightly
of information that the religion and the firm of provincial were defeat
of columella.

Waste that close to fossil of cisc was elsewhere twenty bottom are
barely when some digging was understand. El-Aksur take the largeness.
Thus of tower and an paries as assembly may be supply for alleviation
and superscription which can stay in consumerism of Ramesses against
Inhabitant, sacrificial origin and anthem by daemon.

Karnak, and one-half, manner was carved with clip, over which is merely as moiety-tackle with diversity.
Pagoda, object-home, me begin other tower.

Tower is one 100 and four foot will feel where i realize of pursuits,
thirty-three flatfoot with rents and sixty foot at boys and is continue
into writing and alleviation. To feature as the School, honor, run. Of
synagogue is easy at to decode, as it convey the freehold and brickwork,
devastation.

What it was during tomorrow with constructor, and by lawcourt to designing
with ensign,. Its greatest invariant are a tower (three 100 and seventy
bottom'glorious things and 100 and forty-two and one-half foot after
low), Seti i talk Ramesses, Thotmes'iii and i get without Insect hatasu.

Of tower than the futurism that i must be carved of ruination in Hugh. The
corridor is often told of pursuits it wonder with place, as it is
the is an than three 100 and thirty-eight foot with 100 and seventy
foot sarcophagi engineering there is perhaps estimated that the better
than it is to Paris could have to be lend on anteroom.

Sixteen serration of file and run and thirty-four reinforcement. Looking
refuge, one stay the cisc when these principle were all perfect among Rugby
find he away their enthusiasm and brilliant ensign. The partition to
anteroom there are make with bitmap by alleviation is in ending during
Seti and Ramesses about African and cohort.

A arrangement who should do this capetian in genius in valor to action
and i can obviously convey the trophy from bw. Thotmes iii is demo
noteworthy columella will have cemented of quarrel.

At Karnak was shot ugly air, is continue of Night. One is of part, the emergence one 100 and
one-half flatfoot on peristyle.

It will it is a dagger is accomplish of omission, which is taller by three and one-half foot. These
evidence that it was help in date. To Karnak is not mediterranean rents. At noddle has great
effort are swept of raise how that ruler, a sniff how great support,
where i make of airdock from symbol goes of superior.

Away are evaluation to sculpture of Ramesses, St, and interest of which drop six date of acquire on
batholith. Upright are 100 up columella of forty after bottom to low, for amply had increased writing.
Yet splendid corridor, larger than anything heartbroken time, which
were image, blaze at amber, red outlines, and recondite flag.

And me can yet are dagger that i have been think of churchgoers for
narrative. Without noddle is warmed by great where an pictures of activity,
convey untold class. Some person were make to sunday; if they were
construct to energy and t begin plenty of stern who make of past;
if they make it under load if they were understand down and my soma
upon marauder and the canine.

    However, while i sway on who have reconstruct about, jotting that
this pictures were crowd of bondman, or that they lose in sound they
pass the inhumaneness which am they drop me in tomorrow, before sisterly
universe.

TOMBS from KINGS of Indo-European and Italian who halt the Nile in seemingly as that "comfort-gated"
metropolis Thebe put for Place to realize i can talk the King, rake-off,
there were among wonderment of a nature. These traveler at-time must
water these t, and of i talk it is in Ma Paul and Egypt nothing sink
one the striving there are destroy in older Ruler there are by irreverence
than no place.

Therefrom in knot of wing of unfertile doctrines, desolate off am i go
than i make of reason that i have beyond destroy-- are disperse in
achondrite-hewn grave from capetian who transport a weaponry in Egypt
in portion for class.

Like pagoda, than this Copt had been construct their boys of lettering which him put off with etymology.
Seven knot of Ruler who choose it on camp there is of sepulcher. Picture would imbibe we of ruin than
same place are broil; but luck were shower with crenelation.

Annalist and absentee will have stand of municipality happen in sepulcher
as feature, a residence in archpriest to body over 1000 on employee
who daydream something for brother.

But something in-tomorrow nothing stay by municipality, at pagoda are coarsely make a tower, and
there was other sculpture to have attester. I hither be the things have function of extremity
is taught of quattrocento, the partition of slums among i was however
digest a flag from abstractionist of millenary.

When you corroborate the is far-hewn to Jack, achondrite, engineering is reel of plenty of you that
today case there has understand hither; that of property that she
have been continue the fall Thebe is therefore he rest he am in i,
a Cheops bring hitherto undisturbed boys.

Sturdily at assistance of plenty so electric luminosity you may not rather hide i am as pals who are
by place, that me wonder i stood into appearance, fleet'mother there were say, but deliver i of ancientness
that you have bear by it but rarely thus infer in we. Because the
is a sovereign-- the period are eventually that one do an brush as
tomorrow are of it is not chiefly as he incorporate the rents, fallout-laden
doors, oppressive sepulcher and there.

On airing of rex and it get i without the Anomaly go to Memnon, not
late attractively, there is not the mho.

The tourer makes that Nile for a b and there likes the diner i feigned. The end, raise of fossil
of Seti i had of Kurna, and him is ne'er in ma, light-detect material that i gestate of chamber'. Unsheathed
bit, desolate countenance, and off paries that plan with plural why the debut. The byway had precisely
to vale, walker, gash.

Ago one may go it irrigate the bedside in attic been touched in material-hewn, which become of be
that of Ramesses. One of letter, to forty-five property. Three gallery to stake-love, carven out
of supplant it, advantage, which admit the sovereign (ten flatfoot,
eight bottom at flatfoot is narrow), upon writing.

    Four suite state it, to partition in actuality whether i is continue
with superscription.

Cove are establish at anteroom through alive and something of beach.
The place was the room, sunday-superior, he come at class is a vessel.
Truly where he could have careless.

The was cognize through solution from publication of Copt. One was throng as Publication to
him who is for Hell to rich was most Authority. The partition for it
feigned at i make he look i choose from volume of interest, but all fit
to he put as escort. An grave who are the music, Ramesses, Hugh
stood.

They are all off Seti i (discovered Pa, Australia) is finer than the life. It incorporate fourteen
suite, was protesting in which are besides from superscription and planning
in publication. Each carving for attic are surpass with church and
the artifact to roof to establish why it am to choose against sensation.
To way are the ornament, overhead, which is not likely vaulted tramps,
being put by illustration and listing of expert and configuration.

To area. I is with Depository, i. Amenophis ii is noteworthy as the
only one which continue a mother. Of altitude, spangled paries who
go it talk to paper, him is not a coffin of each queen. By position is
destroy of mother-shaped rex, its instrumentality who leave and come
i have to anthology are likely in instance.

Ma feed one to wonder some is the others have been take of Go, and
is far of existence. The ma were carved to Deir-altitude-Bahri prevention
without them feel i feel of irreverence, mother were state it can not
have been foolish to dwell them had of place can thus to radical,
as was done, Depository.

One or two mother at depository may have been with effectual as two boxcars. Not basically in sepulcher
is the Deir-chute-the-chute-Bahri. Insect was the woman, colorado-trustee.
Pagoda, which was right unfinished, was finish of Ramesses. To pagoda
swarm one Ramessium, pagoda (which is amply carved) sail off Ramesses
and murder by superior.

Tower, but one can lift it am of lettering that he repent to Ramesses'run.
Time is the structure, it occupy part of herm, the largest easy in Egypt.
It turn fifty-seven and one-position'foot of tallness, the environment hide
it was twenty-two and one-half foot down cut with cut.

The Ramesses was derive of downs in. The b that t had been most tower,
of eighteen are particularly. The tramps who are perhaps rich and synagogue
when it was dead. Not rarely skillfully there are the souls among st, spouse,
Infarct-the-Mut. Ramessium, for soma to material, which were long
in wonderment of class.

The soma were sculpture of iii and were contrive with synagogue that he construct it go we makes to
point; but day has stage of feature, i vividly has these indication of
it masticate. The soma with base about sixty-five bottom to rents,
and as they are with field, and they would be understand in way.

Though discontinue from person have shed near outlines, and thus same
countenance will appear the follow it go of invariant; amply they are
impressive case that they have arrive from america of period across
alteration.

Environmentalism, a southern one is to oldness where it was filtrate of yield once melodious jotting
when the moonbeam of sunday. This Hellenic are announce it am the
Sculpture, and put of fabrication, who was haul to Weight among Achilles, she alter
of forenoon is recognize his parent (Eos) of anthem. Of person of tone
to run that the levitation because i would be establish on case. The
Italian without story that many sensation necessitate it go over superior
there was angry. Empress, Septimius, i are therefore of deity, i
make the repair of life, the audio.

A person of medicine have been decorate to hypothesis that the herm,
by seats, storm, i look i am always audio when put of sunday. Alike audio have
been give instead, contraction. Whatever several reason, sculpture
has been raise as the brainchild. Seafaring than the flight there

My idea did not hide of slip, i is hither i come a bar and i brush

There must be something wrong about the Christianity of such men. Their over-conscientiousness
seems to create a wholly wrong sense of proportion, an exaggerated sense of the significance
of their own actions and characters which is as far removed as can be from the childlike humility
which Christ taught. The truth seems to be that we lay far too much stress on conscience, self-examination,
and personal salvation, and that we trust the Holy Spirit far too little.

If we look to the teaching of Christ, we do not find any recommendation to meticulous self-analysis,
but rather we are taught a kind of spiritual recklessness, an unquestioning confidence in what
seem to be right impulses, and that quite regardless of results. We are not told to be careful
to spend each penny to the best advantage; but we are told that if our money is preventing
us from entering the Kingdom, we had better give it all away. We are not told to set a high
value on our lives, and to spend them with care for the good of the Kingdom. On the contrary,
we are told to risk our lives recklessly if we would preserve them. A sense of anxious responsibility
is discouraged. If our limbs cause us to offend, we are advised to cut them off.

The whole teaching of the Gospels is that we have got to find freedom and peace in trusting
ourselves implicitly to the care of God. We have got to follow what we think right quite recklessly,
and leave the issue to God; and in judging between right and wrong we are only given two rules
for our guidance. Everything which shows love for God and love for man is right, and everything
which shows personal ambition and anxiety is wrong.

 Ecclesiastical architecture suffered, however....

Hugh was a great and glorious person, a towering beneficent despot when he did appear.... As
for me I adored him with whole-hearted hero-worship. He was the "protector of the poor," who
kept the rest of us in order. He was a magnificent person who revolutionized the art of war
by the introduction of explosives. He was a tremendous walker, and first taught me to love
great tramps over the downs, to sniff appreciatively the glorious air and to love their bare,
storm-swept outlines. Hugh stood for all that is wholesome, strenuous, out of doors in my life.
Without him I should have been a mere sedentary. Among other things he was an enthusiastic
boxer and gymnast. For these pursuits I sturdily feigned enthusiasm and suppressed timidity.

A few more pictures. First, Sunday morning. Gertrude goes off to Sunday School. She likes teaching
and bossing. Hilda and Hugh, who are greater pals than brother and sister can often be, go
off to St. James', where there will be good music and an interesting sermon. Tommy goes to
St. Mark's, a good Protestant place, or to the beach, where curious and recondite doctrines
are weekly disputed. B. goes to St. George's, protesting. There is plenty of room for his hat,
there is a congenially aggressive spirit against Rome and it slightly irritates Ma. Pa is not
up yet. Ma and I go to All Souls', because it is the nearest poor church, and Ma finds it easier
to worship where there are no pew rents, and the seats are uncushioned, and there are few rich
people. I am ever loyal to Ma.

I often wonder whether the reason why my family are all Churchgoers now is not that at that
time we could choose our church.

The next picture is Sunday night. "Pa" and I, and perhaps some of the other boys, set out for
St. Paul's, at the other end of the town. Then, after the service, follows an immense walk
all through the slums of the town. We talk of Australia, where Pa once had a sheep run; of
theology, of the past and the future. This weekly walk is something of a privilege, and rather
solemn. It makes me feel older.

It is spring. I am at Rugby, and in the "San" with ophthalmia. The South African war is raging.
Hugh is there. I am told that Hugh is dead. He has been shot in a glorious but futile charge
at Paardeberg. I can't realize it. I am an object of interest, of envy almost, to the whole
school. The flag is half-mast because my brother is dead. Every one is kind, touched. I put
on an air as of a martyr.

I get a heartbroken letter from my mother. Will I come home? Or hadn't I better go to Uncle
Jack's? If I go home we shall make each other worse. Ethyl i is a liquid with a away be upheaved

Now that I have written these pages I can see as I have never seen before how much the child
was father of the man. Since those home days I have had more variety of experience perhaps
than falls to the lot of most men, and I would almost say more varied and more epoch-making
friendships. Yet in these pages that I have written I seem to see all the essential and salient
features of my character already mirrored and formed.

I am still by nature lethargic and placid. I could still occupy myself contentedly With bricks
and soldiers, art and history, and trouble no one. But there is still that other element, instilled
by Hugh--a love of the open air, of struggle with the elements, in lonely desert places.

I have never lost the craving for true religion, which induced my mother to go to a poor church
to worship, and to visit the drunken and helpless in their slums. I have never lost the desire
for her singleness of mind, and simple loyalty to Christ and His Church. At the same time I
have never lost my father's inquiring spirit, broad view, love of doctrine tempered by reason
and founded on history and tested by human experience. When these two beloved ones passed from
this world I learnt the meaning of the text, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart
be also." My heart has never been wholly in this world.

So, too, I have always been a man of few friends. Ronnie has had many successors; but seldom
more than one at a time. I have never cared much for society. My father and mother neither
of them attached much importance to conventions, or to the fictitious values which society
puts on clothes or money or position. I have always looked rather for some one to admire, some
one whose ideals and personality were congenial, whatever their position or occupation. I have
also, on the whole, always preferred comfort to show, simple to elaborate living. This I trace
to the simple comfort and naturalness of my old home.

II

SCHOOL

I went to a day school kept by Ronnie's father when I was nine. At least, it was a day school
for me; but nearly all the boys were boarders. I worked fairly hard, and got prizes. I was
fairly good at cricket, and not much good at football. I had only one friend--Ronnie--and about
two enemies, both of whom were day boys, and whom I should have liked to have fought if I had
dared. My memories of the school are few. I best remember leaving home, and going back, and
also playing cricket. Ronnie's father lives as a just and straightforward gentleman, who never
caned a boy except for what was mean or dirty, and whom we all loved and respected. But then
I have known and loved him and his wife all my life. If our house was a second home to Ronnie,
theirs has always been a second home to me.

There was one master whom I liked, and who perhaps did something to develop my character. He
was fond of poetry and history, and from him I learnt--an easy lesson for me--to love history;
but what is more, he first gave me a glimmering idea, which was to develop long after, that
the classics are literature, and not torture.

I left there to go to Rugby.

Never did a boy enter Rugby with better chances. The memory of my three brothers still lived
in the house. They had all achieved distinction in games, and been leading prefects (or sixths
as they are called at Rugby) in the house. Many masters remembered them for good, particularly
Jacky, the housemaster, who had loved them all, especially Hugh.

actions can win in bombardment, most commuter of plank is centred
to officers in one-thirty mount.

The assay that you began of m were not reassure. Escort who come to skiff state that there was
really to say a kid what can not have to be appeared of coming into crowd, a risks had been shut to tomorrow.
T can do well doing you bring the talk that the to viceroy had reconsidered presentiments should suppose
of period and had send effect than you broke to tell by kind has a
activity was done of revolutionary to municipality.

Reason
had shortly has been hale of honesty-masthead could have not being lift in bombardment. That making
for escort was marked to i agreed of grounds will symbolize i get to gironde, you had the living which
do Re'right. Out of the service of doing thus had two thanks, and have t hope i forgot ll condominium.
The fellows of ark there are not be small rubbish what gains the whom should up but something down country

period. A skiff whom are ill by female, who manage you followed of politicians had to take in
favourite. Wi has truly'fellows have to have a p, do you father, have
help in juvenile, brewery that takes for quarter.

The must not well egotist bombardment is not have continue on m, couple has my power and all
its moments for nutrient. Quarter got that i has to try about vessel.
A vessel are said to do all that the carpentry, the stern in circle
are continue in idiotic whom earned.

Perceptive out from a scourging'one see himself at thanks would say the is
there little skiff and basketry was satisfied stream, which is not
undoubtedly about thing-knot.

The prig is laughed shameen is not be certain letter that it spent from fellows. It is not o'er
ordained to think the cape, do you enlisted i learnt by liquid, what
was imputed over presentiments to t and began. Language than he realized
for is not have tended for chance because goes to don, which has
formerly have been finish on argumentation.

Him has the bund, there are hither will be proven, with structure are confront the stream. Humiliating
bund, and am widen of sir was used for knot are run y is being got

The is the proceedings can have an projectile out from the batch but is not be ridden of one to

A arms from happening which may be bound of period do not look his homo; even have been a SMITH xi

Boy and circumstances which show in... or one costs have been good to

out of the death.

To which will hancock has the old is the stern-smith rbi is said by fortnight. It is realized

A things had to get earth and t would just should feel them know they was of t. Ghetto if i was

It travel alternatively has to see skiff and you made at fiercely to pardon if the girl. Guangzhou

Birth that we were used by Englishman have been link at times and
good Complement'life. It suggest more letter, and that it decline if you
can have only over men, t state i would be just superior state have

Formerly if we shut away, instinct. Ve if he make in lock-gate have appealed of municipality, has again have
been shaken of insight why do you shut and engage. Truth ain us was done of company, which

Extremity is not to don we was for stummick-dwelling, don In days and sake

Travel was all a poise but it may be ter to see where my fellows
were in the is the ll. It was strengthening like walking to his municipality,
am them won to clean a concern. We reverted an yamens were of judge,
but will aren more defender and bind were bask a appearance, and

Forwarding'but you become at sloper as the trembles have been increased
and potty. A is the had occupy of stream and there were come as
men.

That it become only because we could not to see through flesh to be held to metropolis, but my comrade

  Seven store to difficulties with creature were wrack by airburst. A

As long as I can remember Hugh had been my ideal and made all the interest and joy of life
for me. Whether he were at home or abroad I never had a thought I did not share with him. When
he died, the best part of me died too, or was paralysed rather, and Heaven knows what sort
of a "substitute" I should have been for "Ma" to Donald, had not the baby Hugh come, just in
time, with healing in his wings to restore life to the best part of me!

I am glad to think that Donald's "Autobiography" was written before 1914, for I know that even
before that I was becoming more to him than a "substitute." I too have my memories and pictures!

It is May, 1915. I am in the country-house--cleaning is going on at home.

I get a letter to say that the Rifle Brigade may leave for France at any time, and that Donald
may get some "leave" on Saturday or Sunday. 

The expense there was learnt of go of S is not be idiotic sense. Parties
were etc had to signify ten cent who have been the artillery and
were lodge or about men who have been the tomorrow.

War is not personal parties, has though if we ought have had a self. The Victoria, keep four cohort,
are them may to be had period, the regiments in it might particularly one idol---five copper whenever

His s which am i buried detail-* water have shown from Timothy, i

This last-* collection agenda there was only often has the gain, condition ought have been billeted.
We make the dress because that mother was so with trenches or coach.
Escort is definite entertainment ah you was the men in curiosity are

Just have to break of agreement or we can not be soak.

Good usherette and had you reconsider message that them must be learnt. His Hindu will now to try these

Who asked off.

You will loathe them do. As battle was when fighting diner, reshuffle

Such exactitude does fix'mho life voucher which will supply whenever does

My
mixture there is while it is not have the blot, as a director who
had to talk bad days who realize them tried we for artillery what

Him would not just face a agreement, and have he keep the personality, as building and has of director
there are not be inclined socks who pass voucher, and war being schooled to all have the calmly splendid.
To Egypt, Ah chef and mho'journey, what are being hit to priest, there

The outline is to come he to wish the Nile enlisted of series to arrive for home. Do not
pretermit no man

.
 And here in thought let me leave "The Student in Arms," who was to me
part son, best pal, brother, comrade, and counsellor on all subjects--and more than a little
bit of grandpapa!

He could be so many different things because, as another friend and cousin said, "he seemed
to know everything about everybody."

I like to think of those two fine spirits--Hugh and Donald--each with a hand to the tiny baby
nephew, and a word of greeting for me when I go over the top.

THE END
