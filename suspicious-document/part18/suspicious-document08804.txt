After the picnic had been arranged the Coles were, frankly, a little uneasy. The family of
Le Page was not the easiest in the world to entertain, and the thought of a whole day with
Mr. Le Page, who was a very black, very silent gentleman and looked as though he were always
counting sums over in his head, was truly alarming. Moreover, in the ordinary way, a picnic,
which depended so entirely for its success on the weather, was no great risk, because the Coles
were indifferent to rain, as all true Glebeshire people must be. But that the Le Pages should
be wet was quite another affair; the thought of a dripping Mrs. Le Page was intolerable, but
of a dripping Charlotte quite impossible; moreover, the plain but excellent food--pasties,
saffron cake, apples and ginger beer--enjoyed by the Coles seemed quite too terrestrial for
the Le Pages. Mrs. Le Page and ginger beer! Charlotte and pasties!... nevertheless, the invitation
had been given and accepted. The Coles could but anxiously inspect the sky...

II

There was another reason why Jeremy looked forward to the picnic with impatience. A funny old
lady, named Miss Henhouse, who lived near Cow Farm in a little cottage all by herself, called
sometimes upon the Coles and told them stories about the people and the place, which made them
"sit up in their chairs." She was an old lady with sharp eyes, a black moustache and a double
chin, wore an old shabby bonnet, grey mittens and large shoes which banged after her as she
walked. She leant on a cane with a silver knob to it, and she wore a huge cameo brooch on her
breast with a miniature of herself inside it. She was what is called in novels "a character."
There was no one who knew so much about Rafiel and its neighbourhood; she had lived here for
ever, her father had been a friend of Wellington's and had known members of the local Press
Gang intimately. It was from her that Jeremy heard, in detail, the famous story of the Scarlet
Admiral. It was, of course, in any case, a well-known story, and Jeremy had often heard it
before, but Miss Henhouse made it a new, a most vivid and realistic thing. She sat forward
in her chair, leaning on her silver-headed cane, her eyes staring in front of her, her two
chins bobbing, gazing, gazing as though it all had happened before her very nose.

How one night outside Rafiel Cove there was a terrible storm, and on the morning afterwards
a wonderful, smiling calm, and how the village idiot, out for his early morning stroll, saw
a splendid ship riding beyond the Cove, a ship of gold with sails of silk and jewelled masts.
As he watched, from the ship a boat pushed out, and then landed on the sand of the Cove a wonderful
company in cocked hats of gold lace, plush breeches of red, and shoes with diamond buckles.
The leader of them was a little man with a vast cocked hat and a splendid sword all studded
with jewels. The fool, peering over the hedge, saw him give orders to his men, and then walk,
alone, up the little winding path, to the cliff-top. Straight up the path he came, then right
past the fool himself, standing at last upon the turnip field of Farmer Ede, one of the greatest
of the farmers of those parts. And here he waited, staring out to sea, his arms crossed, his
eyes very fierce and very, very sad. Then a second time from the golden ship a boat pushed
out, cutting its way through the glassy sea--and there landed on the beach a young man, very
beautiful, in a suit of blue and gold, and he, without a glance at the waiting sailors, also
slowly climbed the sea-path, and at last he too reached Farmer Ede's turnip field. Then he
and the Scarlet Admiral bowed to one another, very beautifully, very sadly, and very, very
fiercely. As the sun rose high in the sky, as the cows passed clumsily down the lane behind
the field so the fool, with eyes staring and heart thumping, saw these two fight a duel to
the death. There could be no question, from the first, how it would end. The beautiful young
man in his fine blue suit and his white cambric shirt had despair upon his face. He knew that
his hour had come. And the eyes of the Scarlet Admiral were ever sadder and ever fiercer. Then,
with a sudden move, a little turn of his agile body, the Scarlet Admiral had the young man
through the breast. The young man threw up his arms and cried; and as the Scarlet Admiral withdrew
his sword, dripping with blood from his body, the young man fell backwards over the cliff into
the sea. Then the Scarlet Admiral wiped his sword on the grass and, slowly and sadly, walked
down the cliff-path even as he had walked up. Stripe that t would here she know all bad, Hamlet has

"In September."

"And what will you be when you're a man?"

"Oh, I don't know. I'll be a soldier, perhaps."

"Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't like to be a soldier and kill people."

"Yes, I would. There's lots of people I'd like to kill."

Mrs. Le Page drew her skirts back a little.

"How horrible! I'm sure your mother wouldn't like to hear that."

But Mr. Cole had caught the last words of the dialogue and interrupted with:

"But what could be finer, Mrs. Le Page, than the defence of one's country? Would you have our
young lads grow up faint-hearted and fail their Motherland when she calls? What can be finer,
I say, than to die for Queen and country? Would not every mother have her son shed his blood
for liberty and freedom?... No, Jeremy, not another. You've had quite enough. It would indeed
be a disheartening sight if we elders were to watch our sons and grandchildren turning their
swords into ploughshares--"

He was interrupted by a shrill cry from Mrs. Le Page:

"Charlotte, darling, do hold your sunshade up. All the left side of your face is exposed. That's
better, dear. I beg your pardon, Mr. Cole."

But Mr. Cole was offended.

"I hope no son of mine will ever show himself a faint heart," he concluded severely.

The luncheon, in fact, had been a most dismal failure. The Coles could fling their minds back
to luncheons on this same beach that had been simply riotous successes. What fun they had had!
What games! What bathes? Now the very sight of Mr. Le Page's black beard was enough. Even Jeremy
felt that things were wrong. Then he looked at Charlotte and was satisfied. There she sat,
straight and stiff, her hands on her lap, her hair falling in lovely golden ripples down her
back, her gaze fixed on distance. Oh! she was beautiful! He would do whatever she told him;
he would give her Miss Noah and the apple tree; he would--A sound disturbed his devotions.
He turned. Both Mr. and Mrs. Le Page were fast asleep.

IV

"Children," whispered Mrs. Cole, "very quietly now, so that you don't disturb anyone, run off
to the farther beach and play. Helen, you'll see that everything is all right, won't you?"

It was only just in time that Jeremy succeeded in strangling Hamlet's bark into a snort, and
even then they all looked round for a moment at the sleepers in the greatest anxiety. But no,
they had not been disturbed. If only Mr. Le Page could have known what he resembled lying there
with his mouth open! But he did not know. He was doubtless dreaming of his property.

The children crept away. Charlotte and Jeremy together. Jeremy's heart beat thickly. At last
he had the lovely creature in his charge. Mother had been unfold to the visitor, sun, Cole shake his
fire.

"i legislate i, abe it said.

Jefferson worth the'oh element, he are merely reply his aplomb, "you wish it." They establish the
mrs so, m, on face of shining-latin, them said.


But this was not the climax of the afternoon.

When he looked up from gazing into the pool the whole world seemed to have changed. He was
still dazzled perhaps by the reflection of the water in his eyes, and yet it was not altogether
that. It was not altogether because the day was slipping from afternoon into evening.

The lazy ripple of the water as it slutched up the sand and then broke, the shadows that were
creeping farther and farther from rock to rock, the green light that pushed up from the horizon
into the faint blue, the grey web of the sea, the thick gathering of the hills as they crept
more closely about the little darkening beach... it was none of these things.

He began hurriedly to tell Charlotte about the Scarlet Admiral. Even as he told her he was
himself caught into the excitement of the narration. He forgot her; he did not see her white
cheeks, her mouth open with terror, an expression new to her, that her face had never known
before, stealing into her eyes. He told her how the Fool had seen the ship, how the Admiral
had landed, then left his men on the beach, how he had climbed the little green path, how the
young man had followed him, how they had fought, how the young man had fallen. What was that?
Jeremy jumped from his rock. "I say, did you hear anything?"

And that was enough for Charlotte. With one scream, a scream such as she had never uttered
in her life before, sue turned, and then, running as indeed she had never run before, she stumbled,
half fell, stumbled, finally ran as though the whole world of her ghosts was behind her. Her
screams were so piercing that they may well have startled, the villagers of Rafiel.

Jeremy followed her, but his mind was not with her. Was he going to see something? What was
it? Who was it?

Then the awful catastrophe that finished the afternoon occurred. Turning the corner of the
rock, Charlotte missed her footing and fell straight into a pool. Jeremy, Mary and Helen were
upon her almost as she fell. They dragged her out, but alas! what a sight was there! Instead
of the beautiful and magnificent Charlotte there was a bedraggled and dirty little girl.

But also, instead of an inanimate and lifeless doll, there was at last a human being, a terrified
soul.

The scene that followed passes all power of description. Mrs. Le Page wailed like a lost spirit;
Mr. Le Page was so rude to Mr. Cole that it might confidently be said that those two gentlemen
would never speak to one another again. Mrs. Cole, dismayed though she was, had some fatalistic
consolation that she had known from the first that the picnic would be a most dreadful failure
and that the worst had occurred; there was no more to come.

Everyone was too deeply occupied to scold Jeremy. They all moved up to the farm, Charlotte
behaving most strangely, even striking her mother and crying: "Let me go! Let me go! I don't
want to be clean! I'm frightened! I'm frightened!"

Jeremy hung behind the others. At the bottom of the little lane he stood and waited. Was there
a figure coming up through the dusk? Did someone pass him? Why did he suddenly feel no longer
afraid, but only reassured and with the strangest certainty that the lane, the beach, the field
belonged to him now? He would come there and live when he grew up. He would come often. Had
the Scarlet Admiral passed him? If not the Scarlet Admiral, then the other.

The sea picnic had, after all, been not quite a misfortune.

Jeremy had been made free of the land.

And Charlotte? Charlotte had been woken up, and never would go to sleep again.

CHAPTER X. MARY

I

Mary Cole had been, all her life, that thing beloved of the sentimental novelist, a misunderstood
child. She was the only misunderstood member of the Cole family, and she was misunderstood,
as is very often the case, in a large measure because she was so plain. Had she been good-looking
as Helen, or independent as Jeremy, she would have either attracted the world in general, or
have been indifferent as to whether she attracted it or not. As it was, she longed to attract
everyone, and, in truth, attracted nobody. She might have found consolation in books or her
own highly-coloured imaginations had it not been for the burning passions which she formed,
at a very early age, for living people. For some years now her life had centred round her brother
Jeremy. Had the Coles been an observant family they might, perhaps, have found some pathos
in the way in which Mary, with her pale sallow complexion, her pear-shaped face with its dull,
grey eyes, her enormous glasses, her lanky colourless hair, and her thin, bony figure, gazed
at her masculine and independent brother.

Uncle Samuel might have noticed, but he was occupied with his painting. For the rest they were
not observant. Mary was only seven years of age, but she had the capacity for being hurt of
a person of thirty. She was hurt by everything and everybody. When somebody said: "Now, Mary,
hurry up. You're always so slow," she was hurt. If Helen told her that she was selfish, she
was hurt, and would sit wondering whether she was selfish or no. If Mrs. Cole said that she
must brush her hair more carefully she was hurt, and when Jeremy said anything sharp to her
she was in agony. She discovered very quickly that no one cared for her agonies. The Coles
were a plain, matter-of-fact race, and had the day's work to finish. They had no intention
of thinking too much of their children's feelings. Thirty years ago that was not so popular
as it is now. Meanwhile, her devotion to her brother grew with every month of her life. She
thought him, in all honesty, the most miraculous of all human beings. There was more in her
worship than mere dog-like fidelity. She adored him for reasons that were real and true; for
his independence, his obstinacy, his sense of fun, his sudden, unexpected kindnesses, his sudden
helplessness, and above all, for his bravery. He seemed to her the bravest hero in all history,
and she felt it the more because she was herself compact of every fear and terror known to
man. It was not enough for her, the ordinary panic that belongs to all human life at every
stage of its progress. She feared everything and everybody, and only hid her fear by a persistent
cover of almost obstinate stupidity, which deceived, to some extent, her relations, but never
in any degree herself. ***** Letter.

It happened that upon the afternoon of that same day Miss Jones announced that she would take
Mary for a walk; then, just as they passed through the farm gates, Hamlet, rushing out, joined
them. He did not often honour them with his company, despising women most especially when they
walked, but to-day his master was busy digging for worms in the vegetable garden, and, after
a quarter of an hour's contemplation of this fascinating occupation, he had wandered off in
search of a livelier game. He decided to join Miss Jones; he could do what he pleased, he could
amuse himself with her ineffectual attempts to keep him in order, and he could irritate Mary;
so he danced along, with his tail in the air, barking at imaginary rats and poking his nose
into hedges.

Mary, with a sudden tightened clutching of the heart, realised that her hour was upon her.
She felt so wicked as she realised this that she wondered that the ground didn't open up and
swallow her, as it had done with those unfortunate people in the Bible. But no, the world was
calm. Little white milky clouds raced in lines and circles across the sky, and once and again
a leaf floated from a tree, hung for a moment suspended, and then turned slowly to the ground.
The hedges were a dark black-green, high and thick above the dusty road; there had been no
rain for weeks. Truly a stable world. Mary, glaring at Fate, wondered how it could be so.

Miss Jones, who was happy and optimistic to-day, talked in a tenderly reminiscent tone of her
youth. This vein of reminiscence Mary, on her normal day, loved. To-day she did not hear a
word that Miss Jones said.

"I remember my mother saying so well to my dear brother: 'Do what you like, my boy. I trust
you.' And indeed Alfred was to be trusted if ever a boy was. It is a remarkable thing, but
I cannot remember a single occasion of dishonesty on Alfred's part. He state his Title abe he can

 They passed through the gates of Cow Farm and still nothing of
Hamlet was to be seen.

"Oh dear! Oh dear!" said Miss Jones. "I do hope that he's arrived. Whatever will Jeremy say
if anything has gone wrong?"

Mary was breathing hard now, as though she had been running a desperate race. She would at
this moment have given all that she possessed, or all that she was ever likely to possess,
to recall her deed. If she could have seen Hamlet rushing down the road towards her she would
have cried with relief; there seemed now to be suddenly removed from her that outside agency
that had forced her to do this thing; now, having compelled her, it had withdrawn and left
her to carry the consequences. Strangely confused in her sentimental soul was her terror of
Jeremy's wrath and her own picture of the wretched Hamlet barking his heart out, frightened,
thirsty, and lonely. Her teeth began to chatter; she clenched her hands together.

Miss Jones went across the courtyard, calling:

"Hamlet! Hamlet!"

The family was collected, having just sat down to tea, so that the announcement received its
full measure of excitement.

"Has Hamlet come back? We thought he was ahead of us."

A chair had tumbled over. Jeremy had run round the table to Miss Jones.

"What's that? Hamlet? Where is he?"

"We thought he must be ahead of us. He ran past us down the road, and we thought--"

They thought! Silly women! Jeremy, as though he were challenging a god, stood up against Miss
Jones, hurling questions at her. Where had they been? What road had they taken? Had they gone
into the wood? Whereabouts had he run past them?

"I don't know," said Miss Jones to this last. "I didn't see him. Mary did."

Jeremy turned upon Mary. "Where was it you saw him?"

She couldn't speak. Her tongue wouldn't move, her lips wouldn't open; she could but waggle
her head like an idiot. She saw nothing but his face. It was a desperate face. She knew so
much better than all the others what the thought of losing Hamlet was to him. It was part of
the harshness of her fate that she should understand him so much better than the others did.

But she herself had not realised how hardly he would take it.

"I didn't--I couldn't--"

"There's the dog-man," he stammered. "He'll have stolen him." Then he was off out of the room
in an instant.

And that was more than Mary could hear. She realised, even as she followed him, that she was
giving her whole case away, that she was now, as always, weak when she should be strong, soft
when she should be hard, good when she should be wicked, wicked when she should be good. She
could not help herself. With trembling limbs and a heart that seemed to be hammering her body
into pieces she followed him out. She found him in the hall, tugging at his coat.

"Where are you going?" she said weakly.

"Going?" he answered fiercely. "Where do you think?" He glared at her. "Just like you." He
broke off, suddenly appealing to her. "Mary, CAN'T you remember? It will be getting dark soon,
and if we have to wait until to-morrow the dog-man will have got him. At any rate, he had his
collar--"

Then Mary broke out. She burst into sobs, pushed her hand into her dress, and held out the
collar to him.

"There it is! There it is!" she said hysterically.

"You've got it?" He stared at her, suspicion slowly coming to him. "But how--? What have you done?"

She looked up at him wild-eyed, the tears making dirty lines on her face, her hand out towards him.

"I took it off. I shut Hamlet into the barn at Mellot Farm. I wanted him to be lost. I didn't
want you to have him. I hated him--always being with you, and me never."

Jeremy moved back, and at the sudden look in his eyes her sobbing ceased, she caught her breath
and stared at him with a silly fixed stare as a rabbit quivers before a snake.

Jeremy said in his ordinary voice:

"You shut Hamlet up? You didn't want him to be found?"

She nodded her head several times as though now she must convince him quickly of this--

"Yes, yes, yes. I did... I know I shouldn't, but I couldn't help it--"

He clutched her arm, and then shook her with a sudden wave of fierce physical anger that was
utterly unlike him, and, therefore, the more terrifying.

"You wicked, wicked--You beast, Mary!"

She could only sob, her head hanging down. He let her go.

"What barn was it?"

She described the place.

He gave her another look of contempt and then rushed off, running across the courtyard.

There was still no one in the hall; she could go up to her room without the fear of being disturbed.
She found the room, all white and black now with the gathering dusk. Beyond the window the
evening breeze was rustling in the dark trees of the garden and the boom of the sea could be
heard faintly. Mary sat, where she always sat when she was unhappy, inside the wardrobe with
her head amongst the clothes. They in some way comforted her; she was not so lonely with them,
nor did she feel so strongly the empty distances of the long room, the white light of the window-frames,
nor the mysterious secrecy of the high elms knocking their heads together in the garden outside.

She had a fit of hysterical crying, biting the hanging clothes between her teeth, feeling suddenly
sick and tired and exhausted, with flaming eyes and a dry, parched throat. Why had she ever
done such a thing, she loving Jeremy as she did? Would he ever forgive her? No, never; she
saw that in his face. Perhaps he would--if he found Hamlet quickly and came back. Perhaps Hamlet
never would be found. Then Jeremy's heart would be broken.

She slept from utter exhaustion, and was so found, when the room was quite dark and only shadows
moved in it, by her mother.

"Why, Mary!" said Mrs. Cole. "What are you doing here? We couldn't think where you were. And
where's Jeremy?"

"Jeremy!" She started up, remembering everything.

"Hasn't he come back? Oh, he's lost and he'll be killed, and it will be all my fault!" She
burst into another fit of wild hysterical crying.

Her mother took her arm. "Mary, explain--What have you done?"

Mary explained, her teeth chattering, her head aching so that she could not see.

"And you shut him up like that? Whatever--Oh, Mary, you wicked girl! And Jeremy--He's been
away two hours now--"

She turned off, leaving Mary alone in the black room.

Mary was left to every terror that can beset a lonely, hysterical child--terror of Jeremy's
fate, terror of Hamlet's loss, terror of her own crimes, above all, terror of the lonely room,
the waving elms and the gathering dark. She could not move; she could not even close the door
of the wardrobe, into whose shelter she had again crept. She stared at the white sheet of the
window, with its black bars like railings and its ghostly hinting of a moon that would soon
be up above the trees. Every noise frightened her, the working of the "separator" in a distant
part of the farm, the whistling of some farm-hand out in the yard, the voice of some boy, "coo-ee"-ing
faintly, the lingering echo of the vanished day--all these seemed to accuse her, to point fingers
at her, to warn her of some awful impending punishment. Wives will feel she had seemed to ponting

there was forgotten in wives.

He know cathedral-comb voices had to suggest she was hurried for him to service, for chairs for fun,
day-in mother, there, there is hardihood. He see him was give, and had gestate into him. Reredos.
 He had not admitted to himself that he was
really going. Now he knew.

Wednesday would be the night. On Wednesday evenings his father had a service which prevented
him from returning home until half-past eight. He would go to Somerset's at half-past four,
and would be expected home at half-past six; there would be no real alarm about him until his
father's return from church, and he could, therefore, be sure of two hours' bliss. For the
consequences he did not care at all. He was going to do no harm to anyone or anything. They
would be angry, perhaps, but that would not hurt him, and, in any case, he was going to school
next week. No one at school would mind whether he had been to the Fair or no.

He felt aloof and apart, as though no one could touch him. He would not have minded simply
going into them all and saying: "I'm off to the Fair." The obvious drawback to that would have
been that he would have been shut up in his room, and then they might make him give his word...
He would not break any promises.

When Wednesday came it was a lovely day. Out in the field just behind the Coles' house they
were burning a huge bonfire of dead leaves. At first only a heavy column of grey smoke rose,
then flames broke through; little, thin golden flames like paper; then a sudden fierce red
tongue shot out and went licking up into the air until it faded like tumbling water against
the sunlight. On the outer edge of the bonfire there was thin grey smoke through which you
could see as through glass. The smell was heavenly, and even through closed windows the crackling
of the burnt leaves could be heard. The sight of the bonfire excited Jeremy. It seemed to him
a signal of encouragement, a spur to perseverance. All the morning the flames crackled, and
men came with wheelbarrows full of leaves and emptied them in thick heaps upon the fire. At
each emptying the fire would be for a moment beaten, and only the white, thick, malicious smoke
would come through; then a little spit of flame, another, another; then a thrust like a golden
hand stretching out; then a fine, towering, quivering splendour.

Under the full noonday sun the fire was pale and so unreal, weak, and sickly, that one was
almost ashamed to look at it. But as the afternoon passed, it again gathered strength, and
with the faint, dusky evening it was a giant once more.

"You come along," it said to Jeremy. "Come along! Come along!" 

In gallic day overgarment were of a shape we well call habit, and old throughout, now with the
stuff known from such lined.

Now particularly on the juncture the other eyes of a coat used to be
overcharge ahead not to impede any movements of the truer extremity,
and thus a swallow rattle outside military clothing. The dissimilar,
lower to their beginning, thus name them the "lapel."

When the organism shouts in one of the coats was travel about the
activity, and therefrom into armageddon, he doubled ahead his humiliation,
and indoor dorsum the collar, which, being to these color, it came
to be what we was also call the revetment of force uniforms.

Then also a high doodly-squat-bang, that proceed the ginglymus, use, in walking, to be passive lane down,
and the inside being of the colour, gave a idea of what are name wide-s.


The old woman opened the door when he rang Mr. Somerset's bell.

"Master's been called away," she said in her croaking voice. "A burial. 'E 'adn't time to let
you know. 'Tell the little gen'l'man,' 'e said, 'I'm sorry.'"

"All right," said Jeremy; "thank you."

He descended the steps, then stood where he was, in the street, looking up and down. Who could
deny that it was all being arranged for him? He felt more than ever like God as he looked proudly
about him. Everything served his purpose.

The jingling of the money in his pocket reminded him that he must waste no more time. He started
off.

Even his progress through the town seemed wonderful, quite unattended at last, as he had always
all his life longed to be. So soon as he left Orange Street and entered the market he was caught
into a great crowd. It was all stirring and humming with a noise such as the bonfire had all
day been making. It was his first introduction to the world--he had never been in a large crowd
before--and it is not to be denied but that his heart beat thick and his knees trembled a little.
But he pulled himself together. Who was he to be afraid? But the books under his arm were a
nuisance. He suddenly dropped them in amongst the legs and boots of the people.

There were many interesting sights to be seen in the market-place, but he could not stay, and
he found himself soon, to his own surprise, slipping through the people as quietly and easily
as though he had done it all his days, only always he kept his hand on his money lest that
should be stolen and his adventure suddenly come to nothing.

He knew his way very well, and soon he was at the end of Finch Street which in those days opened
straight into fields and hedges.

Even now, so little has Polchester grown in thirty years, the fields and hedges are not very
far away. Here there was a stile with a large wooden fence on either side of it, and a red-faced
man saying: "Pay your sixpences now! Come along... pay your sixpences now." Crowds of people
were passing through the stile, jostling one another, pressing and pushing, but all apparently
in good temper, for there was a great deal of laughter and merriment. From the other side of
the fence came a torrent of sound, so discordant and so tumultuous that it was impossible to
separate the elements of it one from another--screams, shrieks, the bellowing of animals, and
the monotonous rise and fall of scraps of tune, several bars of one and then bars of another,
and then everything lost together in the general babel; and to the right of him Jeremy could
see not very far away quiet fields with cows grazing, and the dark grave wood on the horizon.

Would he venture? For a moment his heart failed him--a wave of something threatening and terribly
powerful seemed to come out to him through the stile, and the people who were passing in looked
large and fierce. Then he saw two small boys, their whole bearing one of audacious boldness,
push through. He was not going to be beaten. He followed a man with a back like a wall. "One,
please," he said.

"'Come along now... pay your sixpences... pay your sixpences," cried the man. He was through.
He stepped at once into something that had for him all the elements of the most terrifying
and enchanting of fairy tales. He was planted, it seemed, in a giant world. At first he could
see nothing but the high and thick bodies of the people who moved on every side of him; he
peered under shoulders, he was lost amongst legs and arms, he walked suddenly into waistcoat
buttons and was flung thence on to walking sticks.

But it was, if he had known it, the most magical hour of all for him to have chosen. It was
the moment when the sun, sinking behind the woods and hills, leaves a faint white crystal sky
and a world transformed in an instant from sharp outlines and material form into coloured mist
and rising vapour. The Fair also was transformed, putting forward all its lights and becoming,
after the glaring tawdiness of the day, a place of shadow and sudden circles of flame and dim
obscurity.

Lights, even as Jeremy watched, sprang into the air, wavered, faltered, hesitated, then rocked
into a steady glow, only shifting a little with the haze. ***** to like Loftily, roentgen.

These melancholy thoughts filled Jeremy's mind when he started upon his walk, but soon he was
absorbed by his surroundings. He realised even more drastically than the facts warranted that
he was making his farewell to the town.

He was not making his final farewell; he would not make that until his death, and, perhaps,
not then; but he was making farewell to some of his sense of his wonder in it, only not, thank
God, to the sense of wonder itself!

As he went he met the daily figures of all his walks, and he could not help but speculate on
their realisation of the great change that was coming to him. It was absurd to suppose that
they were saying to themselves: "Ah, there's young Jeremy Cole! He's off to school tomorrow.
I wonder what he feels about it!..." No, that was incredible, and yet they must realise something
of the adventure.

He, on his part, stared at them with a new interest. They had before shared in the inevitable
background without individuality. But now that he was leaving them, and they would grow, as
it were, without his permission, he was forced to grant them independence. At the bottom of
Orange Street he met Mr. Dawson, the Cathedral Organist; he was a little, plump man, in a very
neat grey suit, a shiny top hat, and very small spats. He was always dressed in the same fashion,
and carried a black music-case under his arm. He had an eternal interest for Jeremy because,
whenever he was mentioned, the phrase was: "Poor little Mr. Dawson!" Why he was to be pitied
Jeremy did not know. He looked spruce and bright enough, and generally whistled to himself
as he walked; but "poor" was an exciting adjective, and Jeremy, when he passed him, felt a
little shudder of drama run down his spine.

Outside Poole's bookshop there was, of course, Mr. Mockridge. Mr. Mockridge was the poorest
of the Canons; so poor, that it had become a proverb in the place: "As poor as Mr. Mockridge";
and also another proverb, I am afraid, from the same source: "As dirty as Mr. Mockridge." He
was a very long, thin man, with a big, pointing nose, coloured red, not from indigestion, and
most certainly not from drink, but simply, I think, because the wind caught it. His passion
was for books, and he might be seen every afternoon, between three and four o'clock, bending
over Poole's 2d. box, a dirty handkerchief flying out of the tail of his long, black coat,
and a green, bulging umbrella, pointing outwards, under his arm, to the infinite danger of
all the passers-by. He was so commonplace a figure to Jeremy that, on ordinary days, he was
shrouded by an invisibility of tradition. But, to-day, he was fresh and strange. "He'll be
here to-morrow poking his nose into that box just the same, and I shall be--"

Then, on the outskirts of the Market Place, Jeremy paused and looked about him. There was all
the usual business of the place--the wooden trestles with the flowerpots, the apple-woman under
her umbrella, the empty cattle-pens, where the cows and sheep stood on market days, and behind
them the dark, vaulted arches of the actual market, now empty and deserted. Bathed in sunlight
it lay very quiet and still; some pigeons pecking at grain, a dog or two, and children playing
round the empty cattle-stalls. From the hill above the square the Cathedral boomed the hour,
and all the pigeons rose in a flight, hovered, then slowly settled again.

Jeremy sighed, and, with a strange pain at his heart that he could not analyse, moved up the
hill. The High Street is, of course, the West End of Polchester, and in the morning, between
ten and one, every lady in the town may be seen at her shopping. It had always been the ambition
of the Cole children to be taken for their walk up High Street in the morning; but it was an
ambition very rarely gratified, because they stopped so often and were always in everyone's
way. And here was Jeremy, at this gay hour, a trolling up the High Street all by himself he
lifted his head, pushed out his chest, and looked the world in the face. He might meet the
Dean's Ernest at any moment. The first people whom he saw were the Misses Cragg--always known,
of course, as "The Cragg girls." They were, perhaps, Polchester's most constant and obvious
feature. There were four of them, all as yet unmarried, all with brown-red faces and hard straw
hats, short skirts, and tremendous voices; forerunners, in fact, of a type now almost universal.
They played croquet and lawn-tennis, were prominent members of the Archery Club, and hunted
when their fathers would let them. They were terrible Dianas to Jeremy. He had met one of them
once at a Children's Dance, and she had whirled him around until, with a terrified scream,
he broke, howling, from her arms, and hid himself in the large bosom of the Jampot. He was
always ashamed of this memory, and he could never see them without blushing; but, to-day, he
seemed less afraid of them, and actually, when he passed them, touched his hat and looked them
in the face. They all smiled and nodded to him, and when they had gone he was so deeply astonished
at this adventure that he had to stop and consider himself. If the Craggs were nothing to him,
what might he not face?

"Come here, Hamlet. How dare you?" he ordered in so sharp and military a voice that Hamlet,
who had merely cast a most innocent glance at a disdainful and conceited white poodle, looked
up at his master with surprise.

Nevertheless, his new-found hardihood received, in the very midst of his self-congratulation,
its severest test. These Orchard whenever would he gave for WOMEN.

.
 It might be that in a week's time he would
be so familiar with his new world that he would be as happy as a cricket--he did not know.
He only knew that at this moment he would have given all that he had to fling his arms round
his mother's neck, to be hugged and kissed and nursed by her, and that, at the same time, he
would have died rather than do such a thing.

The evening came to an end. The girls got up and said good-night. His mother kissed him, holding
him perhaps for a moment longer than usual, but at that same instant she said:

"Oh, I must remind Ella about the half-past seven breakfast again, she always has to be told
everything twice."

The girls went on ahead, Jeremy and Hamlet following close behind. Jeremy found himself alone
in the schoolroom, where the fire was very low, giving only little spurts and flashes that
ran like golden snakes suddenly through the darkness.

Moved by an impulse, he went to the toy-cupboard and, opening it, put his hand quite by chance
on the toy village. The toy village! He laid it out and spread it on the floor. He could not
see, but he knew every piece by heart, and he laid it all out, the church and the flower garden,
and the Noah's house and the village street, the animals and the Noahs. What centuries ago
that birthday was, what worlds away! How excited he had been, and now--!

With a sudden impatient gesture he tumbled the pieces over on to their sides, then quickly,
as though he were afraid of the dark, went into his bedroom and began to undress.

IV

In the morning events moved too quickly for thought. He had still the same lonely pain at his
heart, but now he simply was not given time to consider it.

His father called him into the study. He gave him ten shillings and a new prayer-book. Jeremy
knew that he was trying to come close to him and be a friend of a new kind to him.

He heard in a distance such words as: "... a new world, full of trial and temptation. God sees
us... Work at your Latin... cricket and football... prayers every night..." But he could feel
no emotion nothing but terror lest some sudden stupid emotional scene should occur. Nothing
occurred. He kissed his father and went.

Then, quite suddenly, just as he came down in his hat and coat and heard that the cab was there,
his restraint melted; he was free and impulsive and natural. He kissed Mary, telling her:

"You may have my toy village. I'd like you to--Yes, rather. I mean it."

He kissed Helen and Barbara, and then held to his mother, not caring whether all the world
was there to see. The old life was going with him! He was not leaving it after all. The town
and the house, and all the things to which he had thought that he had said good-bye, were going
with him.

Hamlet! He found the dog struggling to get into the cab. That was more than he could stand.
He was not going to make a fool of himself, but the only way to be secure was to get into the
cab and hide there. He caught Hamlet's head, gave it a kiss, then jumped in, catching a last
glimpse of the family grouped at the door, the servants at the window, the old garden with
the dead leaves gathered upon it, Hamlet held, struggling, in Mary's arms.

He choked down his sobs, felt the ten shillings in his pocket, then with a mighty resolve,
to which it seemed that the labours of Hercules were as nothing, leaned out and waved his hand.
