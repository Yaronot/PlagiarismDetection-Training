 The cheek was white and bloodless as a
snowberry, though with the clear and perfect oval of good health; the mouth was delicately
formed, with a certain sad quiet in its lines, which indicated a habitually repressed and sensitive
nature.

The dress of this young person, as often happens in New England, was, in refinement and even
elegance, a marked contrast to that of her male companion and to the humble vehicle in which
she rode. There was not only the most fastidious neatness, but a delicacy in the choice of
colors, an indication of elegant tastes in the whole arrangement, and the quietest suggestion
in the world of an acquaintance with the usages of fashion, which struck one oddly in those
wild and dreary surroundings. On the whole, she impressed one like those fragile wild-flowers
which in April cast their fluttering shadows from the mossy crevices of the old New England
granite,--an existence in which colorless delicacy is united to a sort of elastic hardihood
of life, fit for the rocky soil and harsh winds it is born to encounter.

The scenery of the road along which the two were riding was wild and bare. Only savins and
mulleins, with their dark pyramids or white spires of velvet leaves, diversified the sandy
wayside; but out at sea was a wide sweep of blue, reaching far to the open ocean, which lay
rolling, tossing, and breaking into white caps of foam in the bright sunshine. For two or three
days a northeast storm had been raging, and the sea was in all the commotion which such a general
upturning creates.

The two travelers reached a point of elevated land, where they paused a moment, and the man
drew up the jogging, stiff-jointed old farm-horse, and raised himself upon his feet to look
out at the prospect.

There might be seen in the distance the blue Kennebec sweeping out toward the ocean through
its picturesque rocky shores, docked with cedars and other dusky evergreens, which were illuminated
by the orange and flame-colored trees of Indian summer. Here and there scarlet creepers swung
long trailing garlands over the faces of the dark rock, and fringes of goldenrod above swayed
with the brisk blowing wind that was driving the blue waters seaward, in face of the up-coming
ocean tide,--a conflict which caused them to rise in great foam-crested waves. There are two
channels into this river from the open sea, navigable for ships which are coming in to the
city of Bath; one is broad and shallow, the other narrow and deep, and these are divided by
a steep ledge of rocks.

Where the spectators of this scene were sitting, they could see in the distance a ship borne
with tremendous force by the rising tide into the mouth of the river, and encountering a northwest
wind which had succeeded the gale, as northwest winds often do on this coast. The ship, from
what might be observed in the distance, seemed struggling to make the wider channel, but was
constantly driven off by the baffling force of the wind.

"There she is, Naomi," said the old fisherman, eagerly, to his companion, "coming right in."
The young woman was one of the sort that never start, and never exclaim, but with all deeper
emotions grow still. The color slowly mounted into her cheek, her lips parted, and her eyes
dilated with a wide, bright expression; her breathing came in thick gasps, but she said nothing.

The old fisherman stood up in the wagon, his coarse, butternut-colored coat-flaps fluttering
and snapping in the breeze, while his interest seemed to be so intense in the efforts of the
ship that he made involuntary and eager movements as if to direct her course. A moment passed,
and his keen, practiced eye discovered a change in her movements, for he cried out involuntarily,--

"Don't take the narrow channel to-day!" and a moment after, "O Lord! O Lord! have mercy,--there
they go! Look! look! look!"

And, in fact, the ship rose on a great wave clear out of the water, and the next second seemed
to leap with a desperate plunge into the narrow passage; for a moment there was a shivering
of the masts and the rigging, and she went down and was gone.

"They're split to pieces!" cried the fisherman. "Oh, my poor girl--my poor girl--they're gone!
O Lord, have mercy!"

The woman lifted up no voice, but, as one who has been shot through the heart falls with no
cry, she fell back,--a mist rose up over her great mournful eyes,--she had fainted.

The story of this wreck of a home-bound ship just entering the harbor is yet told in many a
family on this coast. A few hours after, the unfortunate crew were washed ashore in all the
joyous holiday rig in which they had attired themselves that morning to go to their sisters,
wives, and mothers.

This is the first scene in our story.

CHAPTER II

MARA

Down near the end of Orr's Island, facing the open ocean, stands a brown house of the kind
that the natives call "lean-to," or "linter,"--one of those large, comfortable structures,
barren in the ideal, but rich in the practical, which the workingman of New England can always
command. The waters of the ocean came up within a rod of this house, and the sound of its moaning
waves was even now filling the clear autumn starlight. Evidently something was going on within,
for candles fluttered and winked from window to window, like fireflies in a dark meadow, and
sounds as of quick footsteps, and the flutter of brushing garments, might be heard.

Something unusual is certainly going on within the dwelling of Zephaniah Pennel to-night.

Let us enter the dark front-door. We feel our way to the right, where a solitary ray of light
comes from the chink of a half-opened door. Here is the front room of the house, set apart
as its place of especial social hilarity and sanctity,--the "best room," with its low studded
walls, white dimity window-curtains, rag carpet, and polished wood chairs. It is now lit by
the dim gleam of a solitary tallow candle, which seems in the gloom to make only a feeble circle
of light around itself, leaving all the rest of the apartment in shadow.

In the centre of the room, stretched upon a table, and covered partially by a sea-cloak, lies
the body of a man of twenty-five,--lies, too, evidently as one of whom it is written, "He shall
return to his house no more, neither shall his place know him any more." A splendid manhood
has suddenly been called to forsake that lifeless form, leaving it, like a deserted palace,
beautiful in its desolation. The hair, dripping with the salt wave, curled in glossy abundance
on the finely-formed head; the flat, broad brow; the closed eye, with its long black lashes;
the firm, manly mouth; the strongly-moulded chin,--all, all were sealed with that seal which
is never to be broken till the great resurrection day.

He was lying in a full suit of broadcloth, with a white vest and smart blue neck-tie, fastened
with a pin, in which was some braided hair under a crystal. All his clothing, as well as his
hair, was saturated with sea-water, which trickled from time to time, and struck with a leaden
and dropping sound into a sullen pool which lay under the table.

This was the body of James Lincoln, ship-master of the brig Flying Scud, who that morning had
dressed himself gayly in his state-room to go on shore and meet his wife,--singing and jesting
as he did so.

This is all that you have to learn in the room below; but as we stand there, we hear a trampling
of feet in the apartment above,--the quick yet careful opening and shutting of doors,--and
voices come and go about the house, and whisper consultations on the stairs. Now comes the
roll of wheels, and the Doctor's gig drives up to the door; and, as he goes creaking up with
his heavy boots, we will follow and gain admission to the dimly-lighted chamber.

Two gossips are sitting in earnest, whispering conversation over a small bundle done up in
an old flannel petticoat. To them the doctor is about to address himself cheerily, but is repelled
by sundry signs and sounds which warn him not to speak. Moderating his heavy boots as well
as he is able to a pace of quiet, he advances for a moment, and the petticoat is unfolded for
him to glance at its contents; while a low, eager, whispered conversation, attended with much
head-shaking, warns him that his first duty is with somebody behind the checked curtains of
a bed in the farther corner of the room. He steps on tiptoe, and draws the curtain; and there,
with closed eye, and cheek as white as wintry snow, lies the same face over which passed the
shadow of death when that ill-fated ship went down.

This woman was wife to him who lies below, and within the hour has been made mother to a frail
little human existence, which the storm of a great anguish has driven untimely on the shores
of life,--a precious pearl cast up from the past eternity upon the wet, wave-ribbed sand of
the present. Now, weary with her moanings, and beaten out with the wrench of a double anguish,
she lies with closed eyes in that passive apathy which precedes deeper shadows and longer rest.

Over against her, on the other side of the bed, sits an aged woman in an attitude of deep dejection,
and the old man we saw with her in the morning is standing with an anxious, awestruck face
at the foot of the bed.

The doctor feels the pulse of the woman, or rather lays an inquiring finger where the slightest
thread of vital current is scarcely throbbing, and shakes his head mournfully. The touch of
his hand rouses her,--her large wild, melancholy eyes fix themselves on him with an inquiring
glance, then she shivers and moans,--

"Oh, Doctor, Doctor!--Jamie, Jamie!"

"Come, come!" said the doctor, "cheer up, my girl, you've got a fine little daughter,--the
Lord mingles mercies with his afflictions."

Her eyes closed, her head moved with a mournful but decided dissent.

And as she spoke, there passed over her face the sharp frost of the last winter; but even as
it passed there broke out a smile, as if a flower had been thrown down from Paradise, and she
said,--

"Not my will, but thy will," and so was gone.

Aunt Roxy and Aunt Ruey were soon left alone in the chamber of death.

"She'll make a beautiful corpse," said Aunt Roxy, surveying the still, white form contemplatively,
with her head in an artistic attitude.

"She was a pretty girl," said Aunt Ruey; "dear me, what a Providence! I 'member the wedd'n
down in that lower room, and what a handsome couple they were."

"They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their deaths they were not divided,"
said Aunt Roxy, sententiously.

"What was it she said, did ye hear?" said Aunt Ruey.

"She called the baby 'Mary.'"

"Ah! sure enough, her mother's name afore her. What a still, softly-spoken thing she always was!"

"A pity the poor baby didn't go with her," said Aunt Roxy; "seven-months' children are so hard
to raise."

"'Tis a pity," said the other.

But babies will live, and all the more when everybody says that it is a pity they should. Life
goes on as inexorably in this world as death. It was ordered by THE WILL above that out of
these two graves should spring one frail, trembling autumn flower,--the "Mara" whose poor little
roots first struck deep in the salt, bitter waters of our mortal life.

CHAPTER III

THE BAPTISM AND THE BURIAL

Now, I cannot think of anything more unlikely and uninteresting to make a story of than that
old brown "linter" house of Captain Zephaniah Pennel, down on the south end of Orr's Island.

Zephaniah and Mary Pennel, like Zacharias and Elizabeth, are a pair of worthy, God-fearing
people, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless; but that is no
great recommendation to a world gaping for sensation and calling for something stimulating.
This worthy couple never read anything but the Bible, the "Missionary Herald," and the "Christian
Mirror,"--never went anywhere except in the round of daily business. He owned a fishing-smack,
in which he labored after the apostolic fashion; and she washed, and ironed, and scrubbed,
and brewed, and baked, in her contented round, week in and out. The only recreation they ever
enjoyed was the going once a week, in good weather, to a prayer-meeting in a little old brown
school-house, about a mile from their dwelling; and making a weekly excursion every Sunday,
in their fishing craft, to the church opposite, on Harpswell Neck.

To be sure, Zephaniah had read many wide leaves of God's great book of Nature, for, like most
Maine sea-captains, he had been wherever ship can go,--to all usual and unusual ports. His
hard, shrewd, weather-beaten visage had been seen looking over the railings of his brig in
the port of Genoa, swept round by its splendid crescent of palaces and its snow-crested Apennines.
It had looked out in the Lagoons of Venice at that wavy floor which in evening seems a sea
of glass mingled with fire, and out of which rise temples, and palaces, and churches, and distant
silvery Alps, like so many fabrics of dreamland. He had been through the Skagerrack and Cattegat,--into
the Baltic, and away round to Archangel, and there chewed a bit of chip, and considered and
calculated what bargains it was best to make. He had walked the streets of Calcutta in his
shirt-sleeves, with his best Sunday vest, backed with black glazed cambric, which six months
before came from the hands of Miss Roxy, and was pronounced by her to be as good as any tailor
could make; and in all these places he was just Zephaniah Pennel,--a chip of old Maine,--thrifty,
careful, shrewd, honest, God-fearing, and carrying an instinctive knowledge of men and things
under a face of rustic simplicity.

It was once, returning from one of his voyages, that he found his wife with a black-eyed, curly-headed
little creature, who called him papa, and climbed on his knee, nestled under his coat, rifled
his pockets, and woke him every morning by pulling open his eyes with little fingers, and jabbering
unintelligible dialects in his ears.

"We will call this child Naomi, wife," he said, after consulting his old Bible; "for that means
pleasant, and I'm sure I never see anything beat her for pleasantness. I never knew as children
was so engagin'!"

It was to be remarked that Zephaniah after this made shorter and shorter voyages, being somehow
conscious of a string around his heart which pulled him harder and harder, till one Sunday,
when the little Naomi was five years old, he said to his wife,--

"I hope I ain't a-pervertin' Scriptur' nor nuthin', but I can't help thinkin' of one passage,
'The kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman seeking goodly pearls, and when he hath found
one pearl of great price, for joy thereof he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
that pearl.' Well, Mary, I've been and sold my brig last week," he said, folding his daughter's
little quiet head under his coat, "'cause it seems to me the Lord's given us this pearl of
great price, and it's enough for us. I don't want to be rambling round the world after riches.
We'll have a little farm down on Orr's Island, and I'll have a little fishing-smack, and we'll
live and be happy together."

And so Mary, who in those days was a pretty young married woman, felt herself rich and happy,--no
duchess richer or happier. The two contentedly delved and toiled, and the little Naomi was
their princess. The wise men of the East at the feet of an infant, offering gifts, gold, frankincense,
and myrrh, is just a parable of what goes on in every house where there is a young child. All
the hard and the harsh, and the common and the disagreeable, is for the parents,--all the bright
and beautiful for their child.

When the fishing-smack went to Portland to sell mackerel, there came home in Zephaniah's fishy
coat pocket strings of coral beads, tiny gaiter boots, brilliant silks and ribbons for the
little fairy princess,--his Pearl of the Island; and sometimes, when a stray party from the
neighboring town of Brunswick came down to explore the romantic scenery of the solitary island,
they would be startled by the apparition of this still, graceful, dark-eyed child exquisitely
dressed in the best and brightest that the shops of a neighboring city could afford,--sitting
like some tropical bird on a lonely rock, where the sea came dashing up into the edges of arbor
vitæ, or tripping along the wet sands for shells and seaweed.

Many children would have been spoiled by such unlimited indulgence; but there are natures sent
down into this harsh world so timorous, and sensitive, and helpless in themselves, that the
utmost stretch of indulgence and kindness is needed for their development,--like plants which
the warmest shelf of the green-house and the most careful watch of the gardener alone can bring
into flower. The pale child, with her large, lustrous, dark eyes, and sensitive organization,
was nursed and brooded into a beautiful womanhood, and then found a protector in a high-spirited,
manly young ship-master, and she became his wife.

And now we see in the best room--the walls lined with serious faces--men, women, and children,
that have come to pay the last tribute of sympathy to the living and the dead. The house looked
so utterly alone and solitary in that wild, sea-girt island, that one would have as soon expected
the sea-waves to rise and walk in, as so many neighbors; but they had come from neighboring
points, crossing the glassy sea in their little crafts, whose white sails looked like millers'
wings, or walking miles from distant parts of the island.

Some writer calls a funeral one of the amusements of a New England population. Must we call
it an amusement to go and see the acted despair of Medea? or the dying agonies of poor Adrienne
Lecouvreur? It is something of the same awful interest in life's tragedy, which makes an untaught
and primitive people gather to a funeral,--a tragedy where there is no acting,--and one which
each one feels must come at some time to his own dwelling.

Be that as it may, here was a roomful. Not only Aunt Roxy and Aunt Ruey, who by a prescriptive
right presided over all the births, deaths, and marriages of the neighborhood, but there was
Captain Kittridge, a long, dry, weather-beaten old sea-captain, who sat as if tied in a double
bow-knot, with his little fussy old wife, with a great Leghorn bonnet, and eyes like black
glass beads shining through in the bows of her horn spectacles, and her hymn-book in her hand
ready to lead the psalm. There were aunts, uncles, cousins, and brethren of the deceased; and
in the midst stood two coffins, where the two united in death lay sleeping tenderly, as those
to whom rest is good. All was still as death, except a chance whisper from some busy neighbor,
or a creak of an old lady's great black fan, or the fizz of a fly down the window-pane, and
then a stifled sound of deep-drawn breath and weeping from under a cloud of heavy black crape
veils, that were together in the group which country-people call the mourners.

A gleam of autumn sunlight streamed through the white curtains, and fell on a silver baptismal
vase that stood on the mother's coffin, as the minister rose and said, "The ordinance of baptism
will now be administered." A few moments more, and on a baby brow had fallen a few drops of
water, and the little pilgrim of a new life had been called Mara in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,--the minister slowly repeating thereafter those beautiful words of Holy
Writ, "A father of the fatherless is God in his holy habitation,"--as if the baptism of that
bereaved one had been a solemn adoption into the infinite heart of the Lord.

With something of the quaint pathos which distinguishes the primitive and Biblical people of
that lonely shore, the minister read the passage in Ruth from which the name of the little
stranger was drawn, and which describes the return of the bereaved Naomi to her native land.

Deep, heavy sobs from the mourners were for a few moments the only answer to these sad words,
till the minister raised the old funeral psalm of New England,--

    "Why do we mourn departing friends,
      Or shake at Death's alarms?
    'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends
      To call them to his arms.

    "Are we not tending upward too,
      As fast as time can move?
    And should we wish the hours more slow
      That bear us to our love?"

The words rose in old "China,"--that strange, wild warble, whose quaintly blended harmonies
might have been learned of moaning seas or wailing winds, so strange and grand they rose, full
of that intense pathos which rises over every defect of execution; and as they sung, Zephaniah
Pennel straightened his tall form, before bowed on his hands, and looked heavenward, his cheeks
wet with tears, but something sublime and immortal shining upward through his blue eyes; and
at the last verse he came forward involuntarily, and stood by his dead, and his voice rose
over all the others as he sung,--

    "Then let the last loud trumpet sound,
      And bid the dead arise!
    Awake, ye nations under ground!
      Ye saints, ascend the skies!"

The sunbeam through the window-curtain fell on his silver hair, and they that looked beheld
his face as it were the face of an angel; he had gotten a sight of the city whose foundation
is jasper, and whose every gate is a separate pearl. Tall, kingly spruces wore their regal
crowns of cones high in air, sparkling with diamonds of clear exuded gum; vast old hemlocks
of primeval growth stood darkling in their forest shadows, their branches hung with long hoary
moss; while feathery larches, turned to brilliant gold by autumn frosts, lighted up the darker
shadows of the evergreens. It was one of those hazy, calm, dissolving days of Indian summer,
when everything is so quiet that the faintest kiss of the wave on the beach can be heard, and
white clouds seem to faint into the blue of the sky, and soft swathing bands of violet vapor
make all earth look dreamy, and give to the sharp, clear-cut outlines of the northern landscape
all those mysteries of light and shade which impart such tenderness to Italian scenery.

The funeral was over; the tread of many feet, bearing the heavy burden of two broken lives,
had been to the lonely graveyard, and had come back again,--each footstep lighter and more
unconstrained as each one went his way from the great old tragedy of Death to the common cheerful
walks of Life.

The solemn black clock stood swaying with its eternal "tick-tock, tick-tock," in the kitchen
of the brown house on Orr's Island. There was there that sense of a stillness that can be felt,--such
as settles down on a dwelling when any of its inmates have passed through its doors for the
last time, to go whence they shall not return. The best room was shut up and darkened, with
only so much light as could fall through a little heart-shaped hole in the window-shutter,--for
except on solemn visits, or prayer meetings, or weddings, or funerals, that room formed no
part of the daily family scenery.

The kitchen was clean and ample, with a great open fireplace and wide stone hearth, and oven
on one side, and rows of old-fashioned splint-bottomed chairs against the wall. A table scoured
to snowy whiteness, and a little work-stand whereon lay the Bible, the "Missionary Herald"
and the "Weekly Christian Mirror," before named, formed the principal furniture. One feature,
however, must not be forgotten,--a great sea-chest, which had been the companion of Zephaniah
through all the countries of the earth. Old, and battered, and unsightly it looked, yet report
said that there was good store within of that which men for the most part respect more than
anything else; and, indeed, it proved often when a deed of grace was to be done,--when a woman
was suddenly made a widow in a coast gale, or a fishing-smack was run down in the fogs off
the banks, leaving in some neighboring cottage a family of orphans,--in all such cases, the
opening of this sea-chest was an event of good omen to the bereaved; for Zephaniah had a large
heart and a large hand, and was apt to take it out full of silver dollars when once it went
in. So the ark of the covenant could not have been looked on with more reverence than the neighbors
usually showed to Captain Pennel's sea-chest.

The afternoon sun is shining in a square of light through the open kitchen-door, whence one
dreamily disposed might look far out to sea, and behold ships coming and going in every variety
of shape and size.

But Aunt Roxy and Aunt Ruey, who for the present were sole occupants of the premises, were
not people of the dreamy kind, and consequently were not gazing off to sea, but attending to
very terrestrial matters that in all cases somebody must attend to. The afternoon was warm
and balmy, but a few smouldering sticks were kept in the great chimney, and thrust deep into
the embers was a mongrel species of snub-nosed tea-pot, which fumed strongly of catnip-tea,
a little of which gracious beverage Miss Roxy was preparing in an old-fashioned cracked India
china tea-cup, tasting it as she did so with the air of a connoisseur.

Apparently this was for the benefit of a small something in long white clothes, that lay face
downward under a little blanket of very blue new flannel, and which something Aunt Roxy, when
not otherwise engaged, constantly patted with a gentle tattoo, in tune to the steady trot of
her knee. All babies knew Miss Roxy's tattoo on their backs, and never thought of taking it
in ill part. On the contrary, it had a vital and mesmeric effect of sovereign force against
colic, and all other disturbers of the nursery; and never was infant known so pressed with
those internal troubles which infants cry about, as not speedily to give over and sink to slumber
at this soothing appliance.

At a little distance sat Aunt Ruey, with a quantity of black crape strewed on two chairs about
her, very busily employed in getting up a mourning-bonnet, at which she snipped, and clipped,
and worked, zealously singing, in a high cracked voice, from time to time, certain verses of
a funeral psalm.

Miss Roxy and Miss Ruey Toothacre were two brisk old bodies of the feminine gender and singular
number, well known in all the region of Harpswell Neck and Middle Bay, and such was their fame
that it had even reached the town of Brunswick, eighteen miles away.

They were of that class of females who might be denominated, in the Old Testament language,
"cunning women,"--that is, gifted with an infinite diversity of practical "faculty," which
made them an essential requisite in every family for miles and miles around. It was impossible
to say what they could not do: they could make dresses, and make shirts and vests and pantaloons,
and cut out boys' jackets, and braid straw, and bleach and trim bonnets, and cook and wash,
and iron and mend, could upholster and quilt, could nurse all kinds of sicknesses, and in default
of a doctor, who was often miles away, were supposed to be infallible medical oracles. Many
a human being had been ushered into life under their auspices,--trotted, chirruped in babyhood
on their knees, clothed by their handiwork in garments gradually enlarging from year to year,
watched by them in the last sickness, and finally arrayed for the long repose by their hands.

These universally useful persons receive among us the title of "aunt" by a sort of general
consent, showing the strong ties of relationship which bind them to the whole human family.
They are nobody's aunts in particular, but aunts to human nature generally. The idea of restricting
their usefulness to any one family, would strike dismay through a whole community. Nobody would
be so unprincipled as to think of such a thing as having their services more than a week or
two at most. Your country factotum knows better than anybody else how absurd it would be

    "To give to a part what was meant for mankind."

Nobody knew very well the ages of these useful sisters. In that cold, clear, severe climate
of the North, the roots of human existence are hard to strike; but, if once people do take
to living, they come in time to a place where they seem never to grow any older, but can always
be found, like last year's mullein stalks, upright, dry, and seedy, warranted to last for any
length of time.

Miss Roxy Toothacre, who sits trotting the baby, is a tall, thin, angular woman, with sharp
black eyes, and hair once black, but now well streaked with gray. These ravages of time, however,
were concealed by an ample mohair frisette of glossy blackness woven on each side into a heap
of stiff little curls, which pushed up her cap border in rather a bristling and decisive way.
In all her movements and personal habits, even to her tone of voice and manner of speaking,
Miss Roxy was vigorous, spicy, and decided. Her mind on all subjects was made up, and she spoke
generally as one having authority; and who should, if she should not? Was she not a sort of
priestess and sibyl in all the most awful straits and mysteries of life? How many births, and
weddings, and deaths had come and gone under her jurisdiction! And amid weeping or rejoicing,
was not Miss Roxy still the master-spirit,--consulted, referred to by all?--was not her word
law and precedent? Her younger sister, Miss Ruey, a pliant, cozy, easy-to-be-entreated personage,
plump and cushiony, revolved around her as a humble satellite. Miss Roxy looked on Miss Ruey
as quite a frisky young thing, though under her ample frisette of carroty hair her head might
be seen white with the same snow that had powdered that of her sister. Aunt Ruey had a face
much resembling the kind of one you may see, reader, by looking at yourself in the convex side
of a silver milk-pitcher. If you try the experiment, this description will need no further
amplification.

The two almost always went together, for the variety of talent comprised in their stock could
always find employment in the varying wants of a family. While one nursed the sick, the other
made clothes for the well; and thus they were always chippering and chatting to each other,
like a pair of antiquated house-sparrows, retailing over harmless gossips, and moralizing in
that gentle jogtrot which befits serious old women. In fact, they had talked over everything
in Nature, and said everything they could think of to each other so often, that the opinions
of one were as like those of the other as two sides of a pea-pod. But as often happens in cases
of the sort, this was not because the two were in all respects exactly alike, but because the
stronger one had mesmerized the weaker into consent.

Miss Roxy was the master-spirit of the two, and, like the great coining machine of a mint,
came down with her own sharp, heavy stamp on every opinion her sister put out. She was matter-of-fact,
positive, and declarative to the highest degree, while her sister was naturally inclined to
the elegiac and the pathetic, indulging herself in sentimental poetry, and keeping a store
thereof in her thread-case, which she had cut from the "Christian Mirror." Miss Roxy sometimes,
in her brusque way, popped out observations on life and things, with a droll, hard quaintness
that took one's breath a little, yet never failed to have a sharp crystallization of truth,--frosty
though it were. She was one of those sensible, practical creatures who tear every veil, and
lay their fingers on every spot in pure business-like good-will; and if we shiver at them at
times, as at the first plunge of a cold bath, we confess to an invigorating power in them after
all.

"Well, now," said Miss Roxy, giving a decisive push to the tea-pot, which buried it yet deeper
in the embers, "ain't it all a strange kind o' providence that this 'ere little thing is left
behind so; and then their callin' on her by such a strange, mournful kind of name,--Mara. I
thought sure as could be 'twas Mary, till the minister read the passage from Scriptur'. Seems
to me it's kind o' odd. I'd call it Maria, or I'd put an Ann on to it. Mara-ann, now, wouldn't
sound so strange."

"It's a Scriptur' name, sister," said Aunt Ruey, "and that ought to be enough for us."

"Well, I don't know," said Aunt Roxy. "Now there was Miss Jones down on Mure P'int called her
twins Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser,--Scriptur' names both, but I never liked 'em. The boys
used to call 'em, Tiggy and Shally, so no mortal could guess they was Scriptur'."

"Well," said Aunt Ruey, drawing a sigh which caused her plump proportions to be agitated in
gentle waves, "'tain't much matter, after all, what they call the little thing, for 'tain't
'tall likely it's goin' to live,--cried and worried all night, and kep' a-suckin' my cheek
and my night-gown, poor little thing! This 'ere's a baby that won't get along without its mother.
What Mis' Pennel's a-goin' to do with it when we is gone, I'm sure I don't know. It comes kind
o' hard on old people to be broke o' their rest. If it's goin' to be called home, it's a pity,
as I said, it didn't go with its mother"--

"And save the expense of another funeral," said Aunt Roxy. "Now when Mis' Pennel's sister asked
her what she was going to do with Naomi's clothes, I couldn't help wonderin' when she said
she should keep 'em for the child."

"She had a sight of things, Naomi did," said Aunt Ruey. "Nothin' was never too much for her.
I don't believe that Cap'n Pennel ever went to Bath or Portland without havin' it in his mind
to bring Naomi somethin'."

"Yes, and she had a faculty of puttin' of 'em on," said Miss Roxy, with a decisive shake of
the head. "Naomi was a still girl, but her faculty was uncommon; and I tell you, Ruey, 'tain't
everybody hes faculty as hes things."

"The poor Cap'n," said Miss Ruey, "he seemed greatly supported at the funeral, but he's dreadful
broke down since. I went into Naomi's room this morning, and there the old man was a-sittin'
by her bed, and he had a pair of her shoes in his hand,--you know what a leetle bit of a foot
she had. I never saw nothin' look so kind o' solitary as that poor old man did!"

"Well," said Miss Roxy, "she was a master-hand for keepin' things, Naomi was; her drawers is
just a sight; she's got all the little presents and things they ever give her since she was
a baby, in one drawer. There's a little pair of red shoes there that she had when she wa'n't
more'n five year old. You 'member, Ruey, the Cap'n brought 'em over from Portland when we was
to the house a-makin' Mis' Pennel's figured black silk that he brought from Calcutty. You 'member
they cost just five and sixpence; but, law! the Cap'n he never grudged the money when 'twas
for Naomi. And so she's got all her husband's keepsakes and things just as nice as when he
give 'em to her."

"It's real affectin'," said Miss Ruey, "I can't all the while help a-thinkin' of the Psalm,--

    "'So fades the lovely blooming flower,--
    Frail, smiling solace of an hour;
    So quick our transient comforts fly,
    And pleasure only blooms to die.'"

"Yes," said Miss Roxy; "and, Ruey, I was a-thinkin' whether or no it wa'n't best to pack away
them things, 'cause Naomi hadn't fixed no baby drawers, and we seem to want some."

"I was kind o' hintin' that to Mis' Pennel this morning," said Ruey, "but she can't seem to
want to have 'em touched."

"Well, we may just as well come to such things first as last," said Aunt Roxy; "'cause if the
Lord takes our friends, he does take 'em; and we can't lose 'em and have 'em too, and we may
as well give right up at first, and done with it, that they are gone, and we've got to do without
'em, and not to be hangin' on to keep things just as they was."

"So I was a-tellin' Mis' Pennel," said Miss Ruey, "but she'll come to it by and by. I wish
the baby might live, and kind o' grow up into her mother's place."

"Well," said Miss Roxy, "I wish it might, but there'd be a sight o' trouble fetchin' on it
up. Folks can do pretty well with children when they're young and spry, if they do get 'em
up nights; but come to grandchildren, it's pretty tough."

"I'm a-thinkin', sister," said Miss Ruey, taking off her spectacles and rubbing her nose thoughtfully,
"whether or no cow's milk ain't goin' to be too hearty for it, it's such a pindlin' little
thing. Now, Mis' Badger she brought up a seven-months' child, and she told me she gave it nothin'
but these 'ere little seed cookies, wet in water, and it throve nicely,--and the seed is good
for wind."

"Oh, don't tell me none of Mis' Badger's stories," said Miss Roxy, "I don't believe in 'em.
Cows is the Lord's ordinances for bringing up babies that's lost their mothers; it stands to
reason they should be,--and babies that can't eat milk, why they can't be fetched up; but babies
can eat milk, and this un will if it lives, and if it can't it won't live." So saying, Miss
Roxy drummed away on the little back of the party in question, authoritatively, as if to pound
in a wholesome conviction at the outset.

"I hope," said Miss Ruey, holding up a strip of black crape, and looking through it from end
to end so as to test its capabilities, "I hope the Cap'n and Mis' Pennel'll get some support
at the prayer-meetin' this afternoon."

"It's the right place to go to," said Miss Roxy, with decision.

"Mis' Pennel said this mornin' that she was just beat out tryin' to submit; and the more she
said, 'Thy will be done,' the more she didn't seem to feel it."

"Them's common feelin's among mourners, Ruey. These 'ere forty years that I've been round nussin',
and layin'-out, and tendin' funerals, I've watched people's exercises. People's sometimes supported
wonderfully just at the time, and maybe at the funeral; but the three or four weeks after,
most everybody, if they's to say what they feel, is unreconciled."

"The Cap'n, he don't say nothin'," said Miss Ruey.

"No, he don't, but he looks it in his eyes," said Miss Roxy; "he's one of the kind o' mourners
as takes it deep; that kind don't cry; it's a kind o' dry, deep pain; them's the worst to get
over it,--sometimes they just says nothin', and in about six months they send for you to nuss
'em in consumption or somethin'. Now, Mis' Pennel, she can cry and she can talk,--well, she'll
get over it; but he won't get no support unless the Lord reaches right down and lifts him up
over the world. I've seen that happen sometimes, and I tell you, Ruey, that sort makes powerful
Christians."

At that moment the old pair entered the door. Zephaniah Pennel came and stood quietly by the
pillow where the little form was laid, and lifted a corner of the blanket. The tiny head was
turned to one side, showing the soft, warm cheek, and the little hand was holding tightly a
morsel of the flannel blanket. He stood swallowing hard for a few moments. At last he said,
with deep humility, to the wise and mighty woman who held her, "I'll tell you what it is, Miss
Roxy, I'll give all there is in my old chest yonder if you'll only make her--live."

CHAPTER V

THE KITTRIDGES

It did live. The little life, so frail, so unprofitable in every mere material view, so precious
in the eyes of love, expanded and flowered at last into fair childhood. Not without much watching
and weariness. Many a night the old fisherman walked the floor with the little thing in his
arms, talking to it that jargon of tender nonsense which fairies bring as love-gifts to all
who tend a cradle. Many a day the good little old grandmother called the aid of gossips about
her, trying various experiments of catnip, and sweet fern, and bayberry, and other teas of
rustic reputation for baby frailties.

At the end of three years, the two graves in the lonely graveyard were sodded and cemented
down by smooth velvet turf, and playing round the door of the brown houses was a slender child,
with ways and manners so still and singular as often to remind the neighbors that she was not
like other children,--a bud of hope and joy,--but the outcome of a great sorrow,--a pearl washed
ashore by a mighty, uprooting tempest. They that looked at her remembered that her father's
eye had never beheld her, and her baptismal cup had rested on her mother's coffin.

She was small of stature, beyond the wont of children of her age, and moulded with a fine waxen
delicacy that won admiration from all eyes. Her hair was curly and golden, but her eyes were
dark like her mother's, and the lids drooped over them in that manner which gives a peculiar
expression of dreamy wistfulness. Every one of us must remember eyes that have a strange, peculiar
expression of pathos and desire, as if the spirit that looked out of them were pressed with
vague remembrances of a past, or but dimly comprehended the mystery of its present life. Even
when the baby lay in its cradle, and its dark, inquiring eyes would follow now one object and
now another, the gossips would say the child was longing for something, and Miss Roxy would
still further venture to predict that that child always would long and never would know exactly
what she was after.

That dignitary sits at this minute enthroned in the kitchen corner, looking majestically over
the press-board on her knee, where she is pressing the next year's Sunday vest of Zephaniah
Pennel. As she makes her heavy tailor's goose squeak on the work, her eyes follow the little
delicate fairy form which trips about the kitchen, busily and silently arranging a little grotto
of gold and silver shells and seaweed. The child sings to herself as she works in a low chant,
like the prattle of a brook, but ever and anon she rests her little arms on a chair and looks
through the open kitchen-door far, far off where the horizon line of the blue sea dissolves
in the blue sky.

"See that child now, Roxy," said Miss Ruey, who sat stitching beside her; "do look at her eyes.
She's as handsome as a pictur', but 't ain't an ordinary look she has neither; she seems a
contented little thing; but what makes her eyes always look so kind o' wishful?"

"Wa'n't her mother always a-longin' and a-lookin' to sea, and watchin' the ships, afore she
was born?" said Miss Roxy; "and didn't her heart break afore she was born? Babies like that
is marked always. They don't know what ails 'em, nor nobody."

"It's her mother she's after," said Miss Ruey.

"The Lord only knows," said Miss Roxy; "but them kind o' children always seem homesick to go
back where they come from. They're mostly grave and old-fashioned like this 'un. If they gets
past seven years, why they live; but it's always in 'em to long; they don't seem to be really
unhappy neither, but if anything's ever the matter with 'em, it seems a great deal easier for
'em to die than to live. Some say it's the mothers longin' after 'em makes 'em feel so, and
some say it's them longin' after their mothers; but dear knows, Ruey, what anything is or what
makes anything. Children's mysterious, that's my mind."

"Mara, dear," said Miss Ruey, interrupting the child's steady lookout, "what you thinking of?"

"Me want somefin'," said the little one.

"That's what she's always sayin'," said Miss Roxy.

"Me want somebody to pay wis'," continued the little one.

"Want somebody to play with," said old Dame Pennel, as she came in from the back-room with
her hands yet floury with kneading bread; "sure enough, she does. Our house stands in such
a lonesome place, and there ain't any children. But I never saw such a quiet little thing--always
still and always busy."

"I'll take her down with me to Cap'n Kittridge's," said Miss Roxy, "and let her play with their
little girl; she'll chirk her up, I'll warrant. She's a regular little witch, Sally is, but
she'll chirk her up. It ain't good for children to be so still and old-fashioned; children
ought to be children. Sally takes to Mara just 'cause she's so different."

"Well, now, you may," said Dame Pennel; "to be sure he can't bear her out of his sight a minute
after he comes in; but after all, old folks can't be company for children."

Accordingly, that afternoon, the little Mara was arrayed in a little blue flounced dress, which
stood out like a balloon, made by Miss Roxy in first-rate style, from a French fashion-plate;
her golden hair was twined in manifold curls by Dame Pennel, who, restricted in her ideas of
ornamentation, spared, nevertheless, neither time nor money to enhance the charms of this single
ornament to her dwelling. Mara was her picture-gallery, who gave her in the twenty-four hours
as many Murillos or Greuzes as a lover of art could desire; and as she tied over the child's
golden curls a little flat hat, and saw her go dancing off along the sea-sands, holding to
Miss Roxy's bony finger, she felt she had in her what galleries of pictures could not buy.

It was a good mile to the one story, gambrel-roofed cottage where lived Captain Kittridge,--the
long, lean, brown man, with his good wife of the great Leghorn bonnet, round, black bead eyes,
and psalm-book, whom we told you of at the funeral. The Captain, too, had followed the sea
in his early life, but being not, as he expressed it, "very rugged," in time changed his ship
for a tight little cottage on the seashore, and devoted himself to boat-building, which he
found sufficiently lucrative to furnish his brown cottage with all that his wife's heart desired,
besides extra money for knick-knacks when she chose to go up to Brunswick or over to Portland
to shop.

The Captain himself was a welcome guest at all the firesides round, being a chatty body, and
disposed to make the most of his foreign experiences, in which he took the usual advantages
of a traveler. In fact, it was said, whether slanderously or not, that the Captain's yarns
were spun to order; and as, when pressed to relate his foreign adventures, he always responded
with, "What would you like to hear?" it was thought that he fabricated his article to suit
his market. In short, there was no species of experience, finny, fishy, or aquatic,--no legend
of strange and unaccountable incident of fire or flood,--no romance of foreign scenery and
productions, to which his tongue was not competent, when he had once seated himself in a double
bow-knot at a neighbor's evening fireside.

His good wife, a sharp-eyed, literal body, and a vigorous church-member, felt some concern
of conscience on the score of these narrations; for, being their constant auditor, she, better
than any one else, could perceive the variations and discrepancies of text which showed their
mythical character, and oftentimes her black eyes would snap and her knitting-needles rattle
with an admonitory vigor as he went on, and sometimes she would unmercifully come in at the
end of a narrative with,--

"Well, now, the Cap'n's told them ar stories till he begins to b'lieve 'em himself, I think."

But works of fiction, as we all know, if only well gotten up, have always their advantages
in the hearts of listeners over plain, homely truth; and so Captain Kittridge's yarns were
marketable fireside commodities still, despite the skepticisms which attended them.

The afternoon sunbeams at this moment are painting the gambrel-roof with a golden brown. It
is September again, as it was three years ago when our story commenced, and the sea and sky
are purple and amethystine with its Italian haziness of atmosphere.

The brown house stands on a little knoll, about a hundred yards from the open ocean. Behind
it rises a ledge of rocks, where cedars and hemlocks make deep shadows into which the sun shoots
golden shafts of light, illuminating the scarlet feathers of the sumach, which throw themselves
jauntily forth from the crevices; while down below, in deep, damp, mossy recesses, rise ferns
which autumn has just begun to tinge with yellow and brown. The little knoll where the cottage
stood had on its right hand a tiny bay, where the ocean water made up amid picturesque rocks--shaggy
and solemn. Here trees of the primeval forest, grand and lordly, looked down silently into
the waters which ebbed and flowed daily into this little pool. Every variety of those beautiful
evergreens which feather the coast of Maine, and dip their wings in the very spray of its ocean
foam, found here a representative. There were aspiring black spruces, crowned on the very top
with heavy coronets of cones; there were balsamic firs, whose young buds breathe the scent
of strawberries; there were cedars, black as midnight clouds, and white pines with their swaying
plumage of needle-like leaves, strewing the ground beneath with a golden, fragrant matting;
and there were the gigantic, wide-winged hemlocks, hundreds of years old, and with long, swaying,
gray beards of moss, looking white and ghostly under the deep shadows of their boughs. And
beneath, creeping round trunk and matting over stones, were many and many of those wild, beautiful
things which embellish the shadows of these northern forests. Long, feathery wreaths of what
are called ground-pines ran here and there in little ruffles of green, and the prince's pine
raised its oriental feather, with a mimic cone on the top, as if it conceived itself to be
a grown-up tree. Whole patches of partridge-berry wove their evergreen matting, dotted plentifully
with brilliant scarlet berries. Here and there, the rocks were covered with a curiously inwoven
tapestry of moss, overshot with the exquisite vine of the Linnea borealis, which in early spring
rings its two fairy bells on the end of every spray; while elsewhere the wrinkled leaves of
the mayflower wove themselves through and through deep beds of moss, meditating silently thoughts
of the thousand little cups of pink shell which they had it in hand to make when the time of
miracles should come round next spring.

Nothing, in short, could be more quaintly fresh, wild, and beautiful than the surroundings
of this little cove which Captain Kittridge had thought fit to dedicate to his boat-building
operations,--where he had set up his tar-kettle between two great rocks above the highest tide-mark,
and where, at the present moment, he had a boat upon the stocks.

Mrs. Kittridge, at this hour, was sitting in her clean kitchen, very busily engaged in ripping
up a silk dress, which Miss Roxy had engaged to come and make into a new one; and, as she ripped,
she cast now and then an eye at the face of a tall, black clock, whose solemn tick-tock was
the only sound that could be heard in the kitchen.

By her side, on a low stool, sat a vigorous, healthy girl of six years, whose employment evidently
did not please her, for her well-marked black eyebrows were bent in a frown, and her large
black eyes looked surly and wrathful, and one versed in children's grievances could easily
see what the matter was,--she was turning a sheet! Perhaps, happy young female reader, you
don't know what that is,--most likely not; for in these degenerate days the strait and narrow
ways of self-denial, formerly thought so wholesome for little feet, are quite grass-grown with
neglect. Childhood nowadays is unceasingly fêted and caressed, the principal difficulty of
the grown people seeming to be to discover what the little dears want,--a thing not always
clear to the little dears themselves. But in old times, turning sheets was thought a most especial
and wholesome discipline for young girls; in the first place, because it took off the hands
of their betters a very uninteresting and monotonous labor; and in the second place, because
it was such a long, straight, unending turnpike, that the youthful travelers, once started
thereupon, could go on indefinitely, without requiring guidance and direction of their elders.
For these reasons, also, the task was held in special detestation by children in direct proportion
to their amount of life, and their ingenuity and love of variety. A dull child took it tolerably
well; but to a lively, energetic one, it was a perfect torture.

"I don't see the use of sewing up sheets one side, and ripping up the other," at last said
Sally, breaking the monotonous tick-tock of the clock by an observation which has probably
occurred to every child in similar circumstances.

"Sally Kittridge, if you say another word about that ar sheet, I'll whip you," was the very
explicit rejoinder; and there was a snap of Mrs. Kittridge's black eyes, that seemed to make
it likely that she would keep her word. It was answered by another snap from the six-year-old
eyes, as Sally comforted herself with thinking that when she was a woman she'd speak her mind
out in pay for all this.

At this moment a burst of silvery child-laughter rang out, and there appeared in the doorway,
illuminated by the afternoon sunbeams, the vision of Miss Roxy's tall, lank figure, with the
little golden-haired, blue-robed fairy, hanging like a gay butterfly upon the tip of a thorn-bush.
Sally dropped the sheet and clapped her hands, unnoticed by her mother, who rose to pay her
respects to the "cunning woman" of the neighborhood.

"Well, now, Miss Roxy, I was 'mazin' afraid you wer'n't a-comin'. I'd just been an' got my
silk ripped up, and didn't know how to get a step farther without you."

"Well, I was finishin' up Cap'n Pennel's best pantaloons," said Miss Roxy; "and I've got 'em
along so, Ruey can go on with 'em; and I told Mis' Pennel I must come to you, if 'twas only
for a day; and I fetched the little girl down, 'cause the little thing's so kind o' lonesome
like. I thought Sally could play with her, and chirk her up a little."

"Well, Sally," said Mrs. Kittridge, "stick in your needle, fold up your sheet, put your thimble
in your work-pocket, and then you may take the little Mara down to the cove to play; but be
sure you don't let her go near the tar, nor wet her shoes. D'ye hear?"

"Yes, ma'am," said Sally, who had sprung up in light and radiance, like a translated creature,
at this unexpected turn of fortune, and performed the welcome orders with a celerity which
showed how agreeable they were; and then, stooping and catching the little one in her arms,
disappeared through the door, with the golden curls fluttering over her own crow-black hair.

The fact was, that Sally, at that moment, was as happy as human creature could be, with a keenness
of happiness that children who have never been made to turn sheets of a bright afternoon can
never realize. The sun was yet an hour high, as she saw, by the flash of her shrewd, time-keeping
eye, and she could bear her little prize down to the cove, and collect unknown quantities of
gold and silver shells, and starfish, and salad-dish shells, and white pebbles for her, besides
quantities of well turned shavings, brown and white, from the pile which constantly was falling
under her father's joiner's bench, and with which she would make long extemporaneous tresses,
so that they might play at being mermaids, like those that she had heard her father tell about
in some of his sea-stories.

"Now, railly, Sally, what you got there?" said Captain Kittridge, as he stood in his shirt-sleeves
peering over his joiner's bench, to watch the little one whom Sally had dumped down into a
nest of clean white shavings. "Wal', wal', I should think you'd a-stolen the big doll I see
in a shop-window the last time I was to Portland. So this is Pennel's little girl?--poor child!"

"Yes, father, and we want some nice shavings."

"Stay a bit, I'll make ye a few a-purpose," said the old man, reaching his long, bony arm,
with the greatest ease, to the farther part of his bench, and bringing up a board, from which
he proceeded to roll off shavings in fine satin rings, which perfectly delighted the hearts
of the children, and made them dance with glee; and, truth to say, reader, there are coarser
and homelier things in the world than a well turned shaving.

"There, go now," he said, when both of them stood with both hands full; "go now and play; and
mind you don't let the baby wet her feet, Sally; them shoes o' hern must have cost five-and-sixpence
at the very least."

That sunny hour before sundown seemed as long to Sally as the whole seam of the sheet; for
childhood's joys are all pure gold; and as she ran up and down the white sands, shouting at
every shell she found, or darted up into the overhanging forest for checkerberries and ground-pine,
all the sorrows of the morning came no more into her remembrance.

The little Mara had one of those sensitive, excitable natures, on which every external influence
acts with immediate power. Stimulated by the society of her energetic, buoyant little neighbor,
she no longer seemed wishful or pensive, but kindled into a perfect flame of wild delight,
and gamboled about the shore like a blue and gold-winged fly; while her bursts of laughter
made the squirrels and blue jays look out inquisitively from their fastnesses in the old evergreens.
Gradually the sunbeams faded from the pines, and the waves of the tide in the little cove came
in, solemnly tinted with purple, flaked with orange and crimson, borne in from a great rippling
sea of fire, into which the sun had just sunk.

"Mercy on us--them children!" said Miss Roxy.

"He's bringin' 'em along," said Mrs. Kittridge, as she looked out of the window and saw the
tall, lank form of the Captain, with one child seated on either shoulder, and holding on by
his head.

The two children were both in the highest state of excitement, but never was there a more marked
contrast of nature. The one seemed a perfect type of well-developed childish health and vigor,
good solid flesh and bones, with glowing skin, brilliant eyes, shining teeth, well-knit, supple
limbs,--vigorously and healthily beautiful; while the other appeared one of those aerial mixtures
of cloud and fire, whose radiance seems scarcely earthly. A physiologist, looking at the child,
would shake his head, seeing one of those perilous organizations, all nerve and brain, which
come to life under the clear, stimulating skies of America, and, burning with the intensity
of lighted phosphorus, waste themselves too early.

The little Mara seemed like a fairy sprite, possessed with a wild spirit of glee. She laughed
and clapped her hands incessantly, and when set down on the kitchen-floor spun round like a
little elf; and that night it was late and long before her wide, wakeful eyes could be veiled
in sleep.

"Company jist sets this 'ere child crazy," said Miss Roxy; "it's jist her lonely way of livin';
a pity Mis' Pennel hadn't another child to keep company along with her."

"Mis' Pennel oughter be trainin' of her up to work," said Mrs. Kittridge. "Sally could oversew
and hem when she wa'n't more'n three years old; nothin' straightens out children like work.
Mis' Pennel she just keeps that ar child to look at."

"All children ain't alike, Mis' Kittridge," said Miss Roxy, sententiously. "This 'un ain't
like your Sally. 'A hen and a bumble-bee can't be fetched up alike, fix it how you will!'"

CHAPTER VI

GRANDPARENTS

Zephaniah Pennel came back to his house in the evening, after Miss Roxy had taken the little
Mara away. He looked for the flowery face and golden hair as he came towards the door, and
put his hand in his vest-pocket, where he had deposited a small store of very choice shells
and sea curiosities, thinking of the widening of those dark, soft eyes when he should present them.

"Where's Mara?" was the first inquiry after he had crossed the threshold.

"Why, Roxy's been an' taken her down to Cap'n Kittridge's to spend the night," said Miss Ruey.
"Roxy's gone to help Mis' Kittridge to turn her spotted gray and black silk. We was talking
this mornin' whether 'no 't would turn, 'cause I thought the spot was overshot, and wouldn't
make up on the wrong side; but Roxy she says it's one of them ar Calcutty silks that has two
sides to 'em, like the one you bought Miss Pennel, that we made up for her, you know;" and
Miss Ruey arose and gave a finishing snap to the Sunday pantaloons, which she had been left
to "finish off,"--which snap said, as plainly as words could say that there was a good job
disposed of.

Zephaniah stood looking as helpless as animals of the male kind generally do when appealed
to with such prolixity on feminine details; in reply to it all, only he asked meekly,--

"Where's Mary?"

"Mis' Pennel? Why, she's up chamber. She'll be down in a minute, she said; she thought she'd
have time afore supper to get to the bottom of the big chist, and see if that 'ere vest pattern
ain't there, and them sticks o' twist for the button-holes, 'cause Roxy she says she never
see nothin' so rotten as that 'ere twist we've been a-workin' with, that Mis' Pennel got over
to Portland; it's a clear cheat, and Mis' Pennel she give more'n half a cent a stick more for
't than what Roxy got for her up to Brunswick; so you see these 'ere Portland stores charge
up, and their things want lookin' after."

Here Mrs. Pennel entered the room, "the Captain" addressing her eagerly,--

"How came you to let Aunt Roxy take Mara off so far, and be gone so long?"

"Why, law me, Captain Pennel! the little thing seems kind o' lonesome. Chil'en want chil'en;
Miss Roxy says she's altogether too sort o' still and old-fashioned, and must have child's
company to chirk her up, and so she took her down to play with Sally Kittridge; there's no
manner of danger or harm in it, and she'll be back to-morrow afternoon, and Mara will have
a real good time."

"Wal', now, really," said the good man, "but it's 'mazin' lonesome."

"Cap'n Pennel, you're gettin' to make an idol of that 'ere child," said Miss Ruey. "We have
to watch our hearts. It minds me of the hymn,--

    "'The fondness of a creature's love,
      How strong it strikes the sense,--
    Thither the warm affections move,
      Nor can we call them hence.'"

Miss Ruey's mode of getting off poetry, in a sort of high-pitched canter, with a strong thump
on every accented syllable, might have provoked a smile in more sophisticated society, but
Zephaniah listened to her with deep gravity, and answered,--

"I'm 'fraid there's truth in what you say, Aunt Ruey. When her mother was called away, I thought
that was a warning I never should forget; but now I seem to be like Jonah,--I'm restin' in
the shadow of my gourd, and my heart is glad because of it. I kind o' trembled at the prayer
meetin' when we was a-singin',--

    "'The dearest idol I have known,
      Whate'er that idol be,
    Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
      And worship only Thee.'"

"Yes," said Miss Ruey, "Roxy says if the Lord should take us up short on our prayers, it would
make sad work with us sometimes."

"Somehow," said Mrs. Pennel, "it seems to me just her mother over again. She don't look like
her. I think her hair and complexion comes from the Badger blood; my mother had that sort o'
hair and skin,--but then she has ways like Naomi,--and it seems as if the Lord had kind o'
given Naomi back to us; so I hope she's goin' to be spared to us."

Mrs. Pennel had one of those natures--gentle, trustful, and hopeful, because not very deep;
she was one of the little children of the world whose faith rests on child-like ignorance,
and who know not the deeper needs of deeper natures; such see only the sunshine and forget
the storm.

This conversation had been going on to the accompaniment of a clatter of plates and spoons
and dishes, and the fizzling of sausages, prefacing the evening meal, to which all now sat
down after a lengthened grace from Zephaniah.

"There's a tremendous gale a-brewin'," he said, as they sat at table. "I noticed the clouds
to-night as I was comin' home, and somehow I felt kind o' as if I wanted all our folks snug
in-doors."

"Why, law, husband, Cap'n Kittridge's house is as good as ours, if it does blow. You never
can seem to remember that houses don't run aground or strike on rocks in storms."

"The Cap'n puts me in mind of old Cap'n Jeduth Scranton," said Miss Ruey, "that built that
queer house down by Middle Bay. The Cap'n he would insist on havin' on't jist like a ship,
and the closet-shelves had holes for the tumblers and dishes, and he had all his tables and
chairs battened down, and so when it came a gale, they say the old Cap'n used to sit in his
chair and hold on to hear the wind blow."

"Well, I tell you," said Captain, "those that has followed the seas hears the wind with different
ears from lands-people. When you lie with only a plank between you and eternity, and hear the
voice of the Lord on the waters, it don't sound as it does on shore."

"Sure enough, the wind is rising," said Miss Ruey, getting up from the table, and flattening
her snub nose against the window-pane. "Dear me, how dark it is! Mercy on us, how the waves
come in!--all of a sheet of foam. I pity the ships that's comin' on coast such a night."

The storm seemed to have burst out with a sudden fury, as if myriads of howling demons had
all at once been loosened in the air. Now they piped and whistled with eldritch screech round
the corners of the house--now they thundered down the chimney--and now they shook the door
and rattled the casement--and anon mustering their forces with wild ado, seemed to career over
the house, and sail high up into the murky air. The dash of the rising tide came with successive
crash upon crash like the discharge of heavy artillery, seeming to shake the very house, and
the spray borne by the wind dashed whizzing against the window-panes.

Zephaniah, rising from supper, drew up the little stand that had the family Bible on it, and
the three old time-worn people sat themselves as seriously down to evening worship as if they
had been an extensive congregation. They raised the old psalm-tune which our fathers called
"Complaint," and the cracked, wavering voices of the women, with the deep, rough bass of the
old sea-captain, rose in the uproar of the storm with a ghostly, strange wildness, like the
scream of the curlew or the wailing of the wind:--

    "Spare us, O Lord, aloud we pray,
      Nor let our sun go down at noon:
    Thy years are an eternal day,
      And must thy children die so soon!"

Miss Ruey valued herself on singing a certain weird and exalted part which in ancient days
used to be called counter, and which wailed and gyrated in unimaginable heights of the scale,
much as you may hear a shrill, fine-voiced wind over a chimney-top; but altogether, the deep
and earnest gravity with which the three filled up the pauses in the storm with their quaint
minor key, had something singularly impressive. When the singing was over, Zephaniah read to
the accompaniment of wind and sea, the words of poetry made on old Hebrew shores, in the dim,
gray dawn of the world:--

"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth; the Lord is upon many
waters. The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The Lord sitteth upon the floods, yea, the Lord sitteth King forever. The Lord will give strength
to his people; yea, the Lord will bless his people with peace."

How natural and home-born sounded this old piece of Oriental poetry in the ears of the three!
The wilderness of Kadesh, with its great cedars, was doubtless Orr's Island, where even now
the goodly fellowship of black-winged trees were groaning and swaying, and creaking as the
breath of the Lord passed over them.

We hear sometimes in these days that the Bible is no more inspired of God than many other books
of historic and poetic merit. It is a fact, however, that the Bible answers a strange and wholly
exceptional purpose by thousands of firesides on all shores of the earth; and, till some other
book can be found to do the same thing, it will not be surprising if a belief of its Divine
origin be one of the ineffaceable ideas of the popular mind. It will be a long while before
a translation from Homer or a chapter in the Koran, or any of the beauties of Shakespeare,
will be read in a stormy night on Orr's Island with the same sense of a Divine presence as
the Psalms of David, or the prayer of Moses, the man of God.

Boom! boom! "What's that?" said Zephaniah, starting, as they rose up from prayer. "Hark! again,
that's a gun,--there's a ship in distress."

"Poor souls," said Miss Ruey; "it's an awful night!"

The captain began to put on his sea-coat.

"You ain't a-goin' out?" said his wife.

"I must go out along the beach a spell, and see if I can hear any more of that ship."

"Mercy on us; the wind'll blow you over!" said Aunt Ruey.

"I rayther think I've stood wind before in my day," said Zephaniah, a grim smile stealing over
his weather-beaten cheeks. In fact, the man felt a sort of secret relationship to the storm,
as if it were in some manner a family connection--a wild, roystering cousin, who drew him out
by a rough attraction of comradeship.

"Well, at any rate," said Mrs. Pennel, producing a large tin lantern perforated with many holes,
in which she placed a tallow candle, "take this with you, and don't stay out long."

The kitchen door opened, and the first gust of wind took off the old man's hat and nearly blew
him prostrate. He came back and shut the door. "I ought to have known better," he said, knotting
his pocket-handkerchief over his head, after which he waited for a momentary lull, and went
out into the storm.

Miss Ruey looked through the window-pane, and saw the light go twinkling far down into the
gloom, and ever and anon came the mournful boom of distant guns.

"Certainly there is a ship in trouble somewhere," she said.

"He never can be easy when he hears these guns," said Mrs. Pennel; "but what can he do, or
anybody, in such a storm, the wind blowing right on to shore?"

"I shouldn't wonder if Cap'n Kittridge should be out on the beach, too," said Miss Ruey; "but
laws, he ain't much more than one of these 'ere old grasshoppers you see after frost comes.
Well, any way, there ain't much help in man if a ship comes ashore in such a gale as this,
such a dark night too."

"It's kind o' lonesome to have poor little Mara away such a night as this is," said Mrs. Pennel;
"but who would a-thought it this afternoon, when Aunt Roxy took her?"

"I 'member my grandmother had a silver cream-pitcher that come ashore in a storm on Mare P'int,"
said Miss Ruey, as she sat trotting her knitting-needles. "Grand'ther found it, half full of
sand, under a knot of seaweed way up on the beach. It had a coat of arms on it,--might have
belonged to some grand family, that pitcher; in the Toothacre family yet."

"I remember when I was a girl," said Mrs. Pennel, "seeing the hull of a ship that went on Eagle
Island; it run way up in a sort of gully between two rocks, and lay there years. They split
pieces off it sometimes to make fires, when they wanted to make a chowder down on the beach."

"My aunt, Lois Toothacre, that lives down by Middle Bay," said Miss Ruey, "used to tell about
a dreadful blow they had once in time of the equinoctial storm; and what was remarkable, she
insisted that she heard a baby cryin' out in the storm,--she heard it just as plain as could be."

"Laws a-mercy," said Mrs. Pennel, nervously, "it was nothing but the wind,--it always screeches
like a child crying; or maybe it was the seals; seals will cry just like babes."

"So they told her; but no,--she insisted she knew the difference,--it was a baby. Well, what
do you think, when the storm cleared off, they found a baby's cradle washed ashore sure enough!"

"But they didn't find any baby," said Mrs. Pennel, nervously.

"No; they searched the beach far and near, and that cradle was all they found. Aunt Lois took
it in--it was a very good cradle, and she took it to use, but every time there came up a gale,
that ar cradle would rock, rock, jist as if somebody was a-sittin' by it; and you could stand
across the room and see there wa'n't nobody there."

"You make me all of a shiver," said Mrs. Pennel.

This, of course, was just what Miss Ruey intended, and she went on:--

"Wal', you see they kind o' got used to it; they found there wa'n't no harm come of its rockin',
and so they didn't mind; but Aunt Lois had a sister Cerinthy that was a weakly girl, and had
the janders. Cerinthy was one of the sort that's born with veils over their faces, and can
see sperits; and one time Cerinthy was a-visitin' Lois after her second baby was born, and
there came up a blow, and Cerinthy comes out of the keepin'-room, where the cradle was a-standin',
and says, 'Sister,' says she, 'who's that woman sittin' rockin' the cradle?' and Aunt Lois
says she, 'Why, there ain't nobody. That ar cradle always will rock in a gale, but I've got
used to it, and don't mind it.' 'Well,' says Cerinthy, 'jist as true as you live, I just saw
a woman with a silk gown on, and long black hair a-hangin' down, and her face was pale as a
sheet, sittin' rockin' that ar cradle, and she looked round at me with her great black eyes
kind o' mournful and wishful, and then she stooped down over the cradle.' 'Well,' says Lois,
'I ain't goin' to have no such doin's in my house,' and she went right in and took up the baby,
and the very next day she jist had the cradle split up for kindlin'; and that night, if you'll
believe, when they was a-burnin' of it, they heard, jist as plain as could be, a baby scream,
scream, screamin' round the house; but after that they never heard it no more."

"I don't like such stories," said Dame Pennel, "'specially to-night, when Mara's away. I shall
get to hearing all sorts of noises in the wind. I wonder when Cap'n Pennel will be back."

And the good woman put more wood on the fire, and as the tongues of flame streamed up high
and clear, she approached her face to the window-pane and started back with half a scream,
as a pale, anxious visage with sad dark eyes seemed to approach her. It took a moment or two
for her to discover that she had seen only the reflection of her own anxious, excited face,
the pitchy blackness without having converted the window into a sort of dark mirror.

Miss Ruey meanwhile began solacing herself by singing, in her chimney-corner, a very favorite
sacred melody, which contrasted oddly enough with the driving storm and howling sea:--

    "Haste, my beloved, haste away,
    Cut short the hours of thy delay;
    Fly like the bounding hart or roe,
    Over the hills where spices grow."

The tune was called "Invitation,"--one of those profusely florid in runs, and trills, and quavers,
which delighted the ears of a former generation; and Miss Ruey, innocently unconscious of the
effect of old age on her voice, ran them up and down, and out and in, in a way that would have
made a laugh, had there been anybody there to notice or to laugh.

"I remember singin' that ar to Mary Jane Wilson the very night she died," said Aunt Ruey, stopping.
"She wanted me to sing to her, and it was jist between two and three in the mornin'; there
was jist the least red streak of daylight, and I opened the window and sat there and sung,
and when I come to 'over the hills where spices grow,' I looked round and there was a change
in Mary Jane, and I went to the bed, and says she very bright, 'Aunt Ruey, the Beloved has
come,' and she was gone afore I could raise her up on her pillow. I always think of Mary Jane
at them words; if ever there was a broken-hearted crittur took home, it was her."

At this moment Mrs. Pennel caught sight through the window of the gleam of the returning lantern,
and in a moment Captain Pennel entered, dripping with rain and spray.

"Why, Cap'n! you're e'en a'most drowned," said Aunt Ruey.

"How long have you been gone? You must have been a great ways," said Mrs. Pennel.

"Yes, I have been down to Cap'n Kittridge's. I met Kittridge out on the beach. We heard the
guns plain enough, but couldn't see anything. I went on down to Kittridge's to get a look at
little Mara."

"Well, she's all well enough?" said Mrs. Pennel, anxiously.

"Oh, yes, well enough. Miss Roxy showed her to me in the trundle-bed, 'long with Sally. The
little thing was lying smiling in her sleep, with her cheek right up against Sally's. I took
comfort looking at her. I couldn't help thinking: 'So he giveth his beloved sleep!'"

CHAPTER VII

FROM THE SEA

During the night and storm, the little Mara had lain sleeping as quietly as if the cruel sea,
that had made her an orphan from her birth, were her kind-tempered old grandfather singing
her to sleep, as he often did,--with a somewhat hoarse voice truly, but with ever an undertone
of protecting love. But toward daybreak, there came very clear and bright into her childish
mind a dream, having that vivid distinctness which often characterizes the dreams of early
childhood.

She thought she saw before her the little cove where she and Sally had been playing the day
before, with its broad sparkling white beach of sand curving round its blue sea-mirror, and
studded thickly with gold and silver shells. She saw the boat of Captain Kittridge upon the
stocks, and his tar-kettle with the smouldering fires flickering under it; but, as often happens
in dreams, a certain rainbow vividness and clearness invested everything, and she and Sally
were jumping for joy at the beautiful things they found on the beach.

Suddenly, there stood before them a woman, dressed in a long white garment. She was very pale,
with sweet, serious dark eyes, and she led by the hand a black-eyed boy, who seemed to be crying
and looking about as for something lost. She dreamed that she stood still, and the woman came
toward her, looking at her with sweet, sad eyes, till the child seemed to feel them in every
fibre of her frame. The woman laid her hand on her head as if in blessing, and then put the
boy's hand in hers, and said, "Take him, Mara, he is a playmate for you;" and with that the
little boy's face flashed out into a merry laugh. The woman faded away, and the three children
remained playing together, gathering shells and pebbles of a wonderful brightness. So vivid
was this vision, that the little one awoke laughing with pleasure, and searched under her pillows
for the strange and beautiful things that she had been gathering in dreamland.

"What's Mara looking after?" said Sally, sitting up in her trundle-bed, and speaking in the
patronizing motherly tone she commonly used to her little playmate.

"All gone, pitty boy--all gone!" said the child, looking round regretfully, and shaking her
golden head; "pitty lady all gone!"

"How queer she talks!" said Sally, who had awakened with the project of building a sheet-house
with her fairy neighbor, and was beginning to loosen the upper sheet and dispose the pillows
with a view to this species of architecture. "Come, Mara, let's make a pretty house!" she said.

"Pitty boy out dere--out dere!" said the little one, pointing to the window, with a deeper
expression than ever of wishfulness in her eyes.

"Come, Sally Kittridge, get up this minute!" said the voice of her mother, entering the door
at this moment; "and here, put these clothes on to Mara, the child mustn't run round in her
best; it's strange, now, Mary Pennel never thinks of such things."

Sally, who was of an efficient temperament, was preparing energetically to second these commands
of her mother, and endue her little neighbor with a coarse brown stuff dress, somewhat faded
and patched, which she herself had outgrown when of Mara's age; with shoes, which had been
coarsely made to begin with, and very much battered by time; but, quite to her surprise, the
child, generally so passive and tractable, opposed a most unexpected and desperate resistance
to this operation. She began to cry and to sob and shake her curly head, throwing her tiny
hands out in a wild species of freakish opposition, which had, notwithstanding, a quaint and
singular grace about it, while she stated her objections in all the little English at her command.

"Mara don't want--Mara want pitty boo des--and pitty shoes."

"Why, was ever anything like it?" said Mrs. Kittridge to Miss Roxy, as they both were drawn
to the door by the outcry; "here's this child won't have decent every-day clothes put on her,--she
must be kept dressed up like a princess. Now, that ar's French calico!" said Mrs. Kittridge,
holding up the controverted blue dress, "and that ar never cost a cent under five-and-sixpence
a yard; it takes a yard and a half to make it, and it must have been a good day's work to make
it up; call that three-and-sixpence more, and with them pearl buttons and thread and all, that
ar dress never cost less than a dollar and seventy-five, and here she's goin' to run out every
day in it!"

"Well, well!" said Miss Roxy, who had taken the sobbing fair one in her lap, "you know, Mis'
Kittridge, this 'ere's a kind o' pet lamb, an old-folks' darling, and things be with her as
they be, and we can't make her over, and she's such a nervous little thing we mustn't cross
her." Saying which, she proceeded to dress the child in her own clothes.

"If you had a good large checked apron, I wouldn't mind putting that on her!" added Miss Roxy,
after she had arrayed the child.

"Here's one," said Mrs. Kittridge; "that may save her clothes some."

Miss Roxy began to put on the wholesome garment; but, rather to her mortification, the little
fairy began to weep again in a most heart-broken manner.

"Don't want che't apon."

"Why don't Mara want nice checked apron?" said Miss Roxy, in that extra cheerful tone by which
children are to be made to believe they have mistaken their own mind.

"Don't want it!" with a decided wave of the little hand; "I's too pitty to wear che't apon."

"Well! well!" said Mrs. Kittridge, rolling up her eyes, "did I ever! no, I never did. If there
ain't depraved natur' a-comin' out early. Well, if she says she's pretty now, what'll it be
when she's fifteen?"

"She'll learn to tell a lie about it by that time," said Miss Roxy, "and say she thinks she's
horrid. The child is pretty, and the truth comes uppermost with her now."

"Haw! haw! haw!" burst with a great crash from Captain Kittridge, who had come in behind, and
stood silently listening during this conversation; "that's musical now; come here, my little
maid, you are too pretty for checked aprons, and no mistake;" and seizing the child in his
long arms, he tossed her up like a butterfly, while her sunny curls shone in the morning light.

"There's one comfort about the child, Miss Kittridge," said Aunt Roxy: "she's one of them that
dirt won't stick to. I never knew her to stain or tear her clothes,--she always come in jist
so nice."

"She ain't much like Sally, then!" said Mrs. Kittridge. "That girl'll run through more clothes!
Only last week she walked the crown out of my old black straw bonnet, and left it hanging on
the top of a blackberry-bush."

"Wal', wal'," said Captain Kittridge, "as to dressin' this 'ere child,--why, ef Pennel's a
mind to dress her in cloth of gold, it's none of our business! He's rich enough for all he
wants to do, and so let's eat our breakfast and mind our own business."

After breakfast Captain Kittridge took the two children down to the cove, to investigate the
state of his boat and tar-kettle, set high above the highest tide-mark. The sun had risen gloriously,
the sky was of an intense, vivid blue, and only great snowy islands of clouds, lying in silver
banks on the horizon, showed vestiges of last night's storm. The whole wide sea was one glorious
scene of forming and dissolving mountains of blue and purple, breaking at the crest into brilliant
silver. All round the island the waves were constantly leaping and springing into jets and
columns of brilliant foam, throwing themselves high up, in silvery cataracts, into the very
arms of the solemn evergreen forests which overhung the shore.

The sands of the little cove seemed harder and whiter than ever, and were thickly bestrewn
with the shells and seaweed which the upturnings of the night had brought in. There lay what
might have been fringes and fragments of sea-gods' vestures,--blue, crimson, purple, and orange
seaweeds, wreathed in tangled ropes of kelp and sea-grass, or lying separately scattered on
the sands. The children ran wildly, shouting as they began gathering sea-treasures; and Sally,
with the air of an experienced hand in the business, untwisted the coils of rosy seaweed, from
which every moment she disengaged some new treasure, in some rarer shell or smoother pebble.

Suddenly, the child shook out something from a knotted mass of sea-grass, which she held up
with a perfect shriek of delight. It was a bracelet of hair, fastened by a brilliant clasp
of green, sparkling stones, such as she had never seen before. She redoubled her cries of delight,
as she saw it sparkle between her and the sun, calling upon her father.

"Father! father! do come here, and see what I've found!"

He came quickly, and took the bracelet from the child's hand; but, at the same moment, looking
over her head, he caught sight of an object partially concealed behind a projecting rock. He
took a step forward, and uttered an exclamation,--

"Well, well! sure enough! poor things!"

There lay, bedded in sand and seaweed, a woman with a little boy clasped in her arms! Both
had been carefully lashed to a spar, but the child was held to the bosom of the woman, with
a pressure closer than any knot that mortal hands could tie. Both were deep sunk in the sand,
into which had streamed the woman's long, dark hair, which sparkled with glittering morsels
of sand and pebbles, and with those tiny, brilliant, yellow shells which are so numerous on
that shore.

The woman was both young and beautiful. The forehead, damp with ocean-spray, was like sculptured
marble,--the eyebrows dark and decided in their outline; but the long, heavy, black fringes
had shut down, as a solemn curtain, over all the history of mortal joy or sorrow that those
eyes had looked upon. A wedding-ring gleamed on the marble hand; but the sea had divorced all
human ties, and taken her as a bride to itself. And, in truth, it seemed to have made to her
a worthy bed, for she was all folded and inwreathed in sand and shells and seaweeds, and a
great, weird-looking leaf of kelp, some yards in length, lay twined around her like a shroud.
The child that lay in her bosom had hair, and face, and eyelashes like her own, and his little
hands were holding tightly a portion of the black dress which she wore.

"Cold,--cold,--stone dead!" was the muttered exclamation of the old seaman, as he bent over
the woman.

"She must have struck her head there," he mused, as he laid his finger on a dark, bruised spot
on her temple. He laid his hand on the child's heart, and put one finger under the arm to see
if there was any lingering vital heat, and then hastily cut the lashings that bound the pair
to the spar, and with difficulty disengaged the child from the cold clasp in which dying love
had bound him to a heart which should beat no more with mortal joy or sorrow.

Sally, after the first moment, had run screaming toward the house, with all a child's forward
eagerness, to be the bearer of news; but the little Mara stood, looking anxiously, with a wishful
earnestness of face.

"Pitty boy,--pitty boy,--come!" she said often; but the old man was so busy, he scarcely regarded
her.

"Now, Cap'n Kittridge, do tell!" said Miss Roxy, meeting him in all haste, with a cap-border
stiff in air, while Dame Kittridge exclaimed,--

"Now, you don't! Well, well! didn't I say that was a ship last night? And what a solemnizing
thought it was that souls might be goin' into eternity!"

"We must have blankets and hot bottles, right away," said Miss Roxy, who always took the earthly
view of matters, and who was, in her own person, a personified humane society. "Miss Kittridge,
you jist dip out your dishwater into the smallest tub, and we'll put him in. Stand away, Mara!
Sally, you take her out of the way! We'll fetch this child to, perhaps. I've fetched 'em to,
when they's seemed to be dead as door-nails!"

"Cap'n Kittridge, you're sure the woman's dead?"

"Laws, yes; she had a blow right on her temple here. There's no bringing her to till the resurrection."

"Well, then, you jist go and get Cap'n Pennel to come down and help you, and get the body into
the house, and we'll attend to layin' it out by and by. Tell Ruey to come down."

Aunt Roxy issued her orders with all the military vigor and precision of a general in case
of a sudden attack. It was her habit. Sickness and death were her opportunities; where they
were, she felt herself at home, and she addressed herself to the task before her with undoubting
faith.

Before many hours a pair of large, dark eyes slowly emerged from under the black-fringed lids
of the little drowned boy,--they rolled dreamily round for a moment, and dropped again in heavy
languor.

The little Mara had, with the quiet persistence which formed a trait in her baby character,
dragged stools and chairs to the back of the bed, which she at last succeeded in scaling, and
sat opposite to where the child lay, grave and still, watching with intense earnestness the
process that was going on. At the moment when the eyes had opened, she stretched forth her
little arms, and said, eagerly, "Pitty boy, come,"--and then, as they closed again, she dropped
her hands with a sigh of disappointment. Yet, before night, the little stranger sat up in bed,
and laughed with pleasure at the treasures of shells and pebbles which the children spread
out on the bed before him.

He was a vigorous, well-made, handsome child, with brilliant eyes and teeth, but the few words
that he spoke were in a language unknown to most present. Captain Kittridge declared it to
be Spanish, and that a call which he most passionately and often repeated was for his mother.
But he was of that happy age when sorrow can be easily effaced, and the efforts of the children
called forth joyous smiles. When his playthings did not go to his liking, he showed sparkles
of a fiery, irascible spirit.

The little Mara seemed to appropriate him in feminine fashion, as a chosen idol and graven
image. She gave him at once all her slender stock of infantine treasures, and seemed to watch
with an ecstatic devotion his every movement,--often repeating, as she looked delightedly around,
"Pitty boy, come."

She had no words to explain the strange dream of the morning; it lay in her, struggling for
expression, and giving her an interest in the new-comer as in something belonging to herself.
Whence it came,--whence come multitudes like it, which spring up as strange, enchanted flowers,
every now and then in the dull, material pathway of life,--who knows? It may be that our present
faculties have among them a rudimentary one, like the germs of wings in the chrysalis, by which
the spiritual world becomes sometimes an object of perception; there may be natures in which
the walls of the material are so fine and translucent that the spiritual is seen through them
as through a glass darkly. It may be, too, that the love which is stronger than death has a
power sometimes to make itself heard and felt through the walls of our mortality, when it would
plead for the defenseless ones it has left behind. All these things may be,--who knows?

       *       *       *       *       *

"There," said Miss Roxy, coming out of the keeping-room at sunset; "I wouldn't ask to see a
better-lookin' corpse. That ar woman was a sight to behold this morning. I guess I shook a
double handful of stones and them little shells out of her hair,--now she reely looks beautiful.
Captain Kittridge has made a coffin out o' some cedar-boards he happened to have, and I lined
it with bleached cotton, and stuffed the pillow nice and full, and when we come to get her
in, she reely will look lovely."

"I s'pose, Mis' Kittridge, you'll have the funeral to-morrow,--it's Sunday."

"Why, yes, Aunt Roxy,--I think everybody must want to improve such a dispensation. Have you
took little Mara in to look at the corpse?"

"Well, no," said Miss Roxy; "Mis' Pennel's gettin' ready to take her home."

"I think it's an opportunity we ought to improve," said Mrs. Kittridge, "to learn children
what death is. I think we can't begin to solemnize their minds too young."

At this moment Sally and the little Mara entered the room.

"Come here, children," said Mrs. Kittridge, taking a hand of either one, and leading them to
the closed door of the keeping-room; "I've got somethin' to show you."

The room looked ghostly and dim,--the rays of light fell through the closed shutter on an object
mysteriously muffled in a white sheet.

Sally's bright face expressed only the vague curiosity of a child to see something new; but
the little Mara resisted and hung back with all her force, so that Mrs. Kittridge was obliged
to take her up and hold her.

She folded back the sheet from the chill and wintry form which lay so icily, lonely, and cold.
Sally walked around it, and gratified her curiosity by seeing it from every point of view,
and laying her warm, busy hand on the lifeless and cold one; but Mara clung to Mrs. Kittridge,
with eyes that expressed a distressed astonishment. The good woman stooped over and placed
the child's little hand for a moment on the icy forehead. The little one gave a piercing scream,
and struggled to get away; and as soon as she was put down, she ran and hid her face in Aunt
Roxy's dress, sobbing bitterly.

"That child'll grow up to follow vanity," said Mrs. Kittridge; "her little head is full of
dress now, and she hates anything serious,--it's easy to see that."

The little Mara had no words to tell what a strange, distressful chill had passed up her arm
and through her brain, as she felt that icy cold of death,--that cold so different from all
others. It was an impression of fear and pain that lasted weeks and months, so that she would
start out of sleep and cry with a terror which she had not yet a sufficiency of language to
describe.

"You seem to forget, Mis' Kittridge, that this 'ere child ain't rugged like our Sally," said
Aunt Roxy, as she raised the little Mara in her arms. "She was a seven-months' baby, and hard
to raise at all, and a shivery, scary little creature."

"Well, then, she ought to be hardened," said Dame Kittridge. "But Mary Pennel never had no
sort of idea of bringin' up children; 'twas jist so with Naomi,--the girl never had no sort
o' resolution, and she just died for want o' resolution,--that's what came of it. I tell ye,
children's got to learn to take the world as it is; and 'tain't no use bringin' on 'em up too
tender. Teach 'em to begin as they've got to go out,--that's my maxim."

"Mis' Kittridge," said Aunt Roxy, "there's reason in all things, and there's difference in
children. 'What's one's meat's another's pison.' You couldn't fetch up Mis' Pennel's children,
and she couldn't fetch up your'n,--so let's say no more 'bout it."

"I'm always a-tellin' my wife that ar," said Captain Kittridge; "she's always wantin' to make
everybody over after her pattern."

"Cap'n Kittridge, I don't think you need to speak," resumed his wife. "When such a loud providence
is a-knockin' at your door, I think you'd better be a-searchin' your own heart,--here it is
the eleventh hour, and you hain't come into the Lord's vineyard yet."

"Oh! come, come, Mis' Kittridge, don't twit a feller afore folks," said the Captain. "I'm goin'
over to Harpswell Neck this blessed minute after the minister to 'tend the funeral,--so we'll
let him preach."

CHAPTER VIII

THE SEEN AND THE UNSEEN

Life on any shore is a dull affair,--ever degenerating into commonplace; and this may account
for the eagerness with which even a great calamity is sometimes accepted in a neighborhood,
as affording wherewithal to stir the deeper feelings of our nature. Thus, though Mrs. Kittridge
was by no means a hard-hearted woman, and would not for the world have had a ship wrecked on
her particular account, yet since a ship had been wrecked and a body floated ashore at her
very door, as it were, it afforded her no inconsiderable satisfaction to dwell on the details
and to arrange for the funeral.

It was something to talk about and to think of, and likely to furnish subject-matter for talk
for years to come when she should go out to tea with any of her acquaintances who lived at
Middle Bay, or Maquoit, or Harpswell Neck. For although in those days,--the number of light-houses
being much smaller than it is now,--it was no uncommon thing for ships to be driven on shore
in storms, yet this incident had undeniably more that was stirring and romantic in it than
any within the memory of any tea-table gossip in the vicinity. Mrs. Kittridge, therefore, looked
forward to the funeral services on Sunday afternoon as to a species of solemn fête, which imparted
a sort of consequence to her dwelling and herself. Notice of it was to be given out in "meeting"
after service, and she might expect both keeping-room and kitchen to be full. Mrs. Pennel had
offered to do her share of Christian and neighborly kindness, in taking home to her own dwelling
the little boy. In fact, it became necessary to do so in order to appease the feelings of the
little Mara, who clung to the new acquisition with most devoted fondness, and wept bitterly
when he was separated from her even for a few moments. Therefore, in the afternoon of the day
when the body was found, Mrs. Pennel, who had come down to assist, went back in company with
Aunt Ruey and the two children.

The September evening set in brisk and chill, and the cheerful fire that snapped and roared
up the ample chimney of Captain Kittridge's kitchen was a pleasing feature. The days of our
story were before the advent of those sullen gnomes, the "air-tights," or even those more sociable
and cheery domestic genii, the cooking-stoves. They were the days of the genial open kitchen-fire,
with the crane, the pot-hooks, and trammels,--where hissed and boiled the social tea-kettle,
where steamed the huge dinner-pot, in whose ample depths beets, carrots, potatoes, and turnips
boiled in jolly sociability with the pork or corned beef which they were destined to flank
at the coming meal.

On the present evening, Miss Roxy sat bolt upright, as was her wont, in one corner of the fireplace,
with her spectacles on her nose, and an unwonted show of candles on the little stand beside
her, having resumed the task of the silk dress which had been for a season interrupted. Mrs.
Kittridge, with her spectacles also mounted, was carefully and warily "running-up breadths,"
stopping every few minutes to examine her work, and to inquire submissively of Miss Roxy if
"it will do?"

Captain Kittridge sat in the other corner busily whittling on a little boat which he was shaping
to please Sally, who sat on a low stool by his side with her knitting, evidently more intent
on what her father was producing than on the evening task of "ten bouts," which her mother
exacted before she could freely give her mind to anything on her own account. As Sally was
rigorously sent to bed exactly at eight o'clock, it became her to be diligent if she wished
to do anything for her own amusement before that hour.

And in the next room, cold and still, was lying that faded image of youth and beauty which
the sea had so strangely given up. Without a name, without a history, without a single accompaniment
from which her past could even be surmised,--there she lay, sealed in eternal silence.

"It's strange," said Captain Kittridge, as he whittled away,--"it's very strange we don't find
anything more of that ar ship. I've been all up and down the beach a-lookin'. There was a spar
and some broken bits of boards and timbers come ashore down on the beach, but nothin' to speak of."

"It won't be known till the sea gives up its dead," said Miss Roxy, shaking her head solemnly,
"and there'll be a great givin' up then, I'm a-thinkin'."

"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Kittridge, with an emphatic nod.

"Father," said Sally, "how many, many things there must be at the bottom of the sea,--so many
ships are sunk with all their fine things on board. Why don't people contrive some way to go
down and get them?"

"They do, child," said Captain Kittridge; "they have diving-bells, and men go down in 'em with
caps over their faces, and long tubes to get the air through, and they walk about on the bottom
of the ocean."

"Did you ever go down in one, father?"

"Why, yes, child, to be sure; and strange enough it was, to be sure. There you could see great
big sea critters, with ever so many eyes and long arms, swimming right up to catch you, and
all you could do would be to muddy the water on the bottom, so they couldn't see you."

"I never heard of that, Cap'n Kittridge," said his wife, drawing herself up with a reproving
coolness.

"Wal', Mis' Kittridge, you hain't heard of everything that ever happened," said the Captain,
imperturbably, "though you do know a sight."

"And how does the bottom of the ocean look, father?" said Sally.

"Laws, child, why trees and bushes grow there, just as they do on land; and great plants,--blue
and purple and green and yellow, and lots of great pearls lie round. I've seen 'em big as chippin'-birds'
eggs."

"Cap'n Kittridge!" said his wife.

"I have, and big as robins' eggs, too, but them was off the coast of Ceylon and Malabar, and
way round the Equator," said the Captain, prudently resolved to throw his romance to a sufficient
distance.

"It's a pity you didn't get a few of them pearls," said his wife, with an indignant appearance
of scorn.

"I did get lots on 'em, and traded 'em off to the Nabobs in the interior for Cashmere shawls
and India silks and sich," said the Captain, composedly; "and brought 'em home and sold 'em
at a good figure, too."

"Oh, father!" said Sally, earnestly, "I wish you had saved just one or two for us."

"Laws, child, I wish now I had," said the Captain, good-naturedly. "Why, when I was in India,
I went up to Lucknow, and Benares, and round, and saw all the Nabobs and Biggums,--why, they
don't make no more of gold and silver and precious stones than we do of the shells we find
on the beach. Why, I've seen one of them fellers with a diamond in his turban as big as my fist."

"Cap'n Kittridge, what are you telling?" said his wife once more.

"Fact,--as big as my fist," said the Captain, obdurately; "and all the clothes he wore was
jist a stiff crust of pearls and precious stones. I tell you, he looked like something in the
Revelations,--a real New Jerusalem look he had."

"I call that ar talk wicked, Cap'n Kittridge, usin' Scriptur' that ar way," said his wife.

"Why, don't it tell about all sorts of gold and precious stones in the Revelations?" said the
Captain; "that's all I meant. Them ar countries off in Asia ain't like our'n,--stands to reason
they shouldn't be; them's Scripture countries, and everything is different there."

"Father, didn't you ever get any of those splendid things?" said Sally.

"Laws, yes, child. Why, I had a great green ring, an emerald, that one of the princes giv'
me, and ever so many pearls and diamonds. I used to go with 'em rattlin' loose in my vest pocket.
I was young and gay in them days, and thought of bringin' of 'em home for the gals, but somehow
I always got opportunities for swappin' of 'em off for goods and sich. That ar shawl your mother
keeps in her camfire chist was what I got for one on 'em."

"Well, well," said Mrs. Kittridge, "there's never any catchin' you, 'cause you've been where
we haven't."

"You've caught me once, and that ought'r do," said the Captain, with unruffled good-nature.
"I tell you, Sally, your mother was the handsomest gal in Harpswell in them days."

"I should think you was too old for such nonsense, Cap'n," said Mrs. Kittridge, with a toss
of her head, and a voice that sounded far less inexorable than her former admonition. In fact,
though the old Captain was as unmanageable under his wife's fireside régime as any brisk old
cricket that skipped and sang around the hearth, and though he hopped over all moral boundaries
with a cheerful alertness of conscience that was quite discouraging, still there was no resisting
the spell of his inexhaustible good-nature.

By this time he had finished the little boat, and to Sally's great delight, began sailing it
for her in a pail of water.

"I wonder," said Mrs. Kittridge, "what's to be done with that ar child. I suppose the selectmen
will take care on't; it'll be brought up by the town."

"I shouldn't wonder," said Miss Roxy, "if Cap'n Pennel should adopt it."

"You don't think so," said Mrs. Kittridge. "'Twould be taking a great care and expense on their
hands at their time of life."

"I wouldn't want no better fun than to bring up that little shaver," said Captain Kittridge;
"he's a bright un, I promise you."

"You, Cap'n Kittridge! I wonder you can talk so," said his wife. "It's an awful responsibility,
and I wonder you don't think whether or no you're fit for it."

"Why, down here on the shore, I'd as lives undertake a boy as a Newfoundland pup," said the
Captain. "Plenty in the sea to eat, drink, and wear. That ar young un may be the staff of their
old age yet."

"You see," said Miss Roxy, "I think they'll adopt it to be company for little Mara; they're
bound up in her, and the little thing pines bein' alone."

"Well, they make a real graven image of that ar child," said Mrs. Kittridge, "and fairly bow
down to her and worship her."

"Well, it's natural," said Miss Roxy. "Besides, the little thing is cunnin'; she's about the
cunnin'est little crittur that I ever saw, and has such enticin' ways."

The fact was, as the reader may perceive, that Miss Roxy had been thawed into an unusual attachment
for the little Mara, and this affection was beginning to spread a warming element though her
whole being. It was as if a rough granite rock had suddenly awakened to a passionate consciousness
of the beauty of some fluttering white anemone that nestled in its cleft, and felt warm thrills
running through all its veins at every tender motion and shadow. A word spoken against the
little one seemed to rouse her combativeness. Nor did Dame Kittridge bear the child the slightest
ill-will, but she was one of those naturally care-taking people whom Providence seems to design
to perform the picket duties for the rest of society, and who, therefore, challenge everybody
and everything to stand and give an account of themselves. Miss Roxy herself belonged to this
class, but sometimes found herself so stoutly overhauled by the guns of Mrs. Kittridge's battery,
that she could only stand modestly on the defensive.

One of Mrs. Kittridge's favorite hobbies was education, or, as she phrased it, the "fetchin'
up" of children, which she held should be performed to the letter of the old stiff rule. In
this manner she had already trained up six sons, who were all following their fortunes upon
the seas, and, on this account, she had no small conceit of her abilities; and when she thought
she discerned a lamb being left to frisk heedlessly out of bounds, her zeal was stirred to
bring it under proper sheepfold regulations.

"Come, Sally, it's eight o'clock," said the good woman.

Sally's dark brows lowered over her large, black eyes, and she gave an appealing look to her
father.

"Law, mother, let the child sit up a quarter of an hour later, jist for once."

"Cap'n Kittridge, if I was to hear to you, there'd never be no rule in this house. Sally, you
go 'long this minute, and be sure you put your knittin' away in its place."

The Captain gave a humorous nod of submissive good-nature to his daughter as she went out.
In fact, putting Sally to bed was taking away his plaything, and leaving him nothing to do
but study faces in the coals, or watch the fleeting sparks which chased each other in flocks
up the sooty back of the chimney.

It was Saturday night, and the morrow was Sunday,--never a very pleasant prospect to the poor
Captain, who, having, unfortunately, no spiritual tastes, found it very difficult to get through
the day in compliance with his wife's views of propriety, for he, alas! soared no higher in
his aims.

"I b'lieve, on the hull, Polly, I'll go to bed, too," said he, suddenly starting up.

"Well, father, your clean shirt is in the right-hand corner of the upper drawer, and your Sunday
clothes on the back of the chair by the bed."

The fact was that the Captain promised himself the pleasure of a long conversation with Sally,
who nestled in the trundle-bed under the paternal couch, to whom he could relate long, many-colored
yarns, without the danger of interruption from her mother's sharp, truth-seeking voice.

A moralist might, perhaps, be puzzled exactly what account to make of the Captain's disposition
to romancing and embroidery. In all real, matter-of-fact transactions, as between man and man,
his word was as good as another's, and he was held to be honest and just in his dealings. It
was only when he mounted the stilts of foreign travel that his paces became so enormous. Perhaps,
after all, a rude poetic and artistic faculty possessed the man. He might have been a humbler
phase of the "mute, inglorious Milton." Perhaps his narrations required the privileges and
allowances due to the inventive arts generally. Certain it was that, in common with other artists,
he required an atmosphere of sympathy and confidence in which to develop himself fully; and,
when left alone with children, his mind ran such riot, that the bounds between the real and
unreal became foggier than the banks of Newfoundland.

The two women sat up, and the night wore on apace, while they kept together that customary
vigil which it was thought necessary to hold over the lifeless casket from which an immortal
jewel had recently been withdrawn.

"I re'lly did hope," said Mrs. Kittridge, mournfully, "that this 'ere solemn Providence would
have been sent home to the Cap'n's mind; but he seems jist as light and triflin' as ever."

"There don't nobody see these 'ere things unless they's effectually called," said Miss Roxy,
"and the Cap'n's time ain't come."

"It's gettin' to be t'ward the eleventh hour," said Mrs. Kittridge, "as I was a-tellin' him
this afternoon."

"Well," said Miss Roxy, "you know

    "'While the lamp holds out to burn,
    The vilest sinner may return.'"

"Yes, I know that," said Mrs. Kittridge, rising and taking up the candle. "Don't you think,
Aunt Roxy, we may as well give a look in there at the corpse?"

It was past midnight as they went together into the keeping-room. All was so still that the
clash of the rising tide and the ticking of the clock assumed that solemn and mournful distinctness
which even tones less impressive take on in the night-watches. Miss Roxy went mechanically
through with certain arrangements of the white drapery around the cold sleeper, and uncovering
the face and bust for a moment, looked critically at the still, unconscious countenance.

"Not one thing to let us know who or what she is," she said; "that boy, if he lives, would
give a good deal to know, some day."

"What is it one's duty to do about this bracelet?" said Mrs. Kittridge, taking from a drawer
the article in question, which had been found on the beach in the morning.

"Well, I s'pose it belongs to the child, whatever it's worth," said Miss Roxy.

"Then if the Pennels conclude to take him, I may as well give it to them," said Mrs. Kittridge,
laying it back in the drawer.

Miss Roxy folded the cloth back over the face, and the two went out into the kitchen. The fire
had sunk low--the crickets were chirruping gleefully. Mrs. Kittridge added more wood, and put
on the tea-kettle that their watching might be refreshed by the aid of its talkative and inspiring
beverage. The two solemn, hard-visaged women drew up to each other by the fire, and insensibly
their very voices assumed a tone of drowsy and confidential mystery.

"If this 'ere poor woman was hopefully pious, and could see what was goin' on here," said Mrs.
Kittridge, "it would seem to be a comfort to her that her child has fallen into such good hands.
It seems a'most a pity she couldn't know it."

"How do you know she don't?" said Miss Roxy, brusquely.

"Why, you know the hymn," said Mrs. Kittridge, quoting those somewhat saddusaical lines from
the popular psalm-book:--

    "'The living know that they must die,
    But all the dead forgotten lie--
    Their memory and their senses gone,
    Alike unknowing and unknown.'"

"Well, I don't know 'bout that," said Miss Roxy, flavoring her cup of tea; "hymn-book ain't
Scriptur', and I'm pretty sure that ar ain't true always;" and she nodded her head as if she
could say more if she chose.

Now Miss Roxy's reputation of vast experience in all the facts relating to those last fateful
hours, which are the only certain event in every human existence, caused her to be regarded
as a sort of Delphic oracle in such matters, and therefore Mrs. Kittridge, not without a share
of the latent superstition to which each human heart must confess at some hours, drew confidentially
near to Miss Roxy, and asked if she had anything particular on her mind.

"Well, Mis' Kittridge," said Miss Roxy, "I ain't one of the sort as likes to make a talk of
what I've seen, but mebbe if I was, I've seen some things as remarkable as anybody. I tell
you, Mis' Kittridge, folks don't tend the sick and dyin' bed year in and out, at all hours,
day and night, and not see some remarkable things; that's my opinion."

"Well, Miss Roxy, did you ever see a sperit?"

"I won't say as I have, and I won't say as I haven't," said Miss Roxy; "only as I have seen
some remarkable things."

There was a pause, in which Mrs. Kittridge stirred her tea, looking intensely curious, while
the old kitchen-clock seemed to tick with one of those fits of loud insistence which seem to
take clocks at times when all is still, as if they had something that they were getting ready
to say pretty soon, if nobody else spoke.

But Miss Roxy evidently had something to say, and so she began:--

"Mis' Kittridge, this 'ere's a very particular subject to be talkin' of. I've had opportunities
to observe that most haven't, and I don't care if I jist say to you, that I'm pretty sure spirits
that has left the body do come to their friends sometimes."

The clock ticked with still more empressement, and Mrs. Kittridge glared through the horn bows
of her glasses with eyes of eager curiosity.

"Now, you remember Cap'n Titcomb's wife, that died fifteen years ago when her husband had gone
to Archangel; and you remember that he took her son John out with him--and of all her boys,
John was the one she was particular sot on."

"Yes, and John died at Archangel; I remember that."

"Jes' so," said Miss Roxy, laying her hand on Mrs. Kittridge's; "he died at Archangel the very
day his mother died, and jist the hour, for the Cap'n had it down in his log-book."

"You don't say so!"

"Yes, I do. Well, now," said Miss Roxy, sinking her voice, "this 'ere was remarkable. Mis'
Titcomb was one of the fearful sort, tho' one of the best women that ever lived. Our minister
used to call her 'Mis' Muchafraid'--you know, in the 'Pilgrim's Progress'--but he was satisfied
with her evidences, and told her so; she used to say she was 'afraid of the dark valley,' and
she told our minister so when he went out, that ar last day he called; and his last words,
as he stood with his hand on the knob of the door, was 'Mis' Titcomb, the Lord will find ways
to bring you thro' the dark valley.' Well, she sunk away about three o'clock in the morning.
I remember the time, 'cause the Cap'n's chronometer watch that he left with her lay on the
stand for her to take her drops by. I heard her kind o' restless, and I went up, and I saw
she was struck with death, and she looked sort o' anxious and distressed.

"'Oh, Aunt Roxy,' says she, 'it's so dark, who will go with me?' and in a minute her whole
face brightened up, and says she, 'John is going with me,' and she jist gave the least little
sigh and never breathed no more--she jist died as easy as a bird. I told our minister of it
next morning, and he asked if I'd made a note of the hour, and I told him I had, and says he,
'You did right, Aunt Roxy.'"

"What did he seem to think of it?"

"Well, he didn't seem inclined to speak freely. 'Miss Roxy,' says he, 'all natur's in the Lord's
hands, and there's no saying why he uses this or that; them that's strong enough to go by faith,
he lets 'em, but there's no saying what he won't do for the weak ones.'"

"Wa'n't the Cap'n overcome when you told him?" said Mrs. Kittridge.

"Indeed he was; he was jist as white as a sheet."

Miss Roxy now proceeded to pour out another cup of tea, and having mixed and flavored it, she
looked in a weird and sibylline manner across it, and inquired,--

"Mis' Kittridge, do you remember that ar Mr. Wadkins that come to Brunswick twenty years ago,
in President Averill's days?"

"Yes, I remember the pale, thin, long-nosed gentleman that used to sit in President Averill's
pew at church. Nobody knew who he was, or where he came from. The college students used to
call him Thaddeus of Warsaw. Nobody knew who he was but the President, 'cause he could speak
all the foreign tongues--one about as well as another; but the President he knew his story,
and said he was a good man, and he used to stay to the sacrament regular, I remember."

"Yes," said Miss Roxy, "he used to live in a room all alone, and keep himself. Folks said he
was quite a gentleman, too, and fond of reading."

"I heard Cap'n Atkins tell," said Mrs. Kittridge, "how they came to take him up on the shores
of Holland. You see, when he was somewhere in a port in Denmark, some men come to him and offered
him a pretty good sum of money if he'd be at such a place on the coast of Holland on such a
day, and take whoever should come. So the Cap'n he went, and sure enough on that day there
come a troop of men on horseback down to the beach with this man, and they all bid him good-by,
and seemed to make much of him, but he never told 'em nothin' on board ship, only he seemed
kind o' sad and pinin'."

"Well," said Miss Roxy; "Ruey and I we took care o' that man in his last sickness, and we watched
with him the night he died, and there was something quite remarkable."

"Do tell now," said Mrs. Kittridge.

"Well, you see," said Miss Roxy, "he'd been low and poorly all day, kind o' tossin' and restless,
and a little light-headed, and the Doctor said he thought he wouldn't last till morning, and
so Ruey and I we set up with him, and between twelve and one Ruey said she thought she'd jist
lop down a few minutes on the old sofa at the foot of the bed, and I made me a cup of tea like
as I'm a-doin' now, and set with my back to him."

"Well?" said Mrs. Kittridge, eagerly.

"Well, you see he kept a-tossin' and throwin' off the clothes, and I kept a-gettin' up to straighten
'em; and once he threw out his arms, and something bright fell out on to the pillow, and I
went and looked, and it was a likeness that he wore by a ribbon round his neck. It was a woman--a
real handsome one--and she had on a low-necked black dress, of the cut they used to call Marie
Louise, and she had a string of pearls round her neck, and her hair curled with pearls in it,
and very wide blue eyes. Well, you see, I didn't look but a minute before he seemed to wake
up, and he caught at it and hid it in his clothes. Well, I went and sat down, and I grew kind
o' sleepy over the fire; but pretty soon I heard him speak out very clear, and kind o' surprised,
in a tongue I didn't understand, and I looked round."

Miss Roxy here made a pause, and put another lump of sugar into her tea.

"Well?" said Mrs. Kittridge, ready to burst with curiosity.

"Well, now, I don't like to tell about these 'ere things, and you mustn't never speak about
it; but as sure as you live, Polly Kittridge, I see that ar very woman standin' at the back
of the bed, right in the partin' of the curtains, jist as she looked in the pictur'--blue eyes
and curly hair and pearls on her neck, and black dress."

"What did you do?" said Mrs. Kittridge.

"Do? Why, I jist held my breath and looked, and in a minute it kind o' faded away, and I got
up and went to the bed, but the man was gone. He lay there with the pleasantest smile on his
face that ever you see; and I woke up Ruey, and told her about it."

Mrs. Kittridge drew a long breath. "What do you think it was?"

"Well," said Miss Roxy, "I know what I think, but I don't think best to tell. I told Doctor
Meritts, and he said there were more things in heaven and earth than folks knew about--and
so I think."

       *       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, on this same evening, the little Mara frisked like a household fairy round the hearth
of Zephaniah Pennel.

The boy was a strong-limbed, merry-hearted little urchin, and did full justice to the abundant
hospitalities of Mrs. Pennel's tea-table; and after supper little Mara employed herself in
bringing apronful after apronful of her choicest treasures, and laying them down at his feet.
His great black eyes flashed with pleasure, and he gamboled about the hearth with his new playmate
in perfect forgetfulness, apparently, of all the past night of fear and anguish.

When the great family Bible was brought out for prayers, and little Mara composed herself on
a low stool by her grandmother's side, he, however, did not conduct himself as a babe of grace.
He resisted all Miss Ruey's efforts to make him sit down beside her, and stood staring with
his great, black, irreverent eyes during the Bible-reading, and laughed out in the most inappropriate
manner when the psalm-singing began, and seemed disposed to mingle incoherent remarks of his
own even in the prayers.

"This is a pretty self-willed youngster," said Miss Ruey, as they rose from the exercises,
"and I shouldn't think he'd been used to religious privileges."

"Perhaps not," said Zephaniah Pennel; "but who can say but what this providence is a message
of the Lord to us--such as Pharaoh's daughter sent about Moses, 'Take this child, and bring
him up for me'?"

"I'd like to take him, if I thought I was capable," said Mrs. Pennel, timidly. "It seems a
real providence to give Mara some company; the poor child pines so for want of it."

"Well, then, Mary, if you say so, we will bring him up with our little Mara," said Zephaniah,
drawing the child toward him. "May the Lord bless him!" he added, laying his great brown hands
on the shining black curls of the child.

CHAPTER IX

MOSES

Sunday morning rose clear and bright on Harpswell Bay. The whole sea was a waveless, blue looking-glass,
streaked with bands of white, and flecked with sailing cloud-shadows from the skies above.
Orr's Island, with its blue-black spruces, its silver firs, its golden larches, its scarlet
sumachs, lay on the bosom of the deep like a great many-colored gem on an enchanted mirror.
A vague, dreamlike sense of rest and Sabbath stillness seemed to brood in the air. The very
spruce-trees seemed to know that it was Sunday, and to point solemnly upward with their dusky
fingers; and the small tide-waves that chased each other up on the shelly beach, or broke against
projecting rocks, seemed to do it with a chastened decorum, as if each blue-haired wave whispered
to his brother, "Be still--be still."

 Instructed by her, all the
good wives knew the difference between his very best long silk stocking and his second best,
and how carefully the first had to be kept under lock and key, where he could not get at them;
for he was understood, good as he was, to have concealed in him all the thriftless and pernicious
inconsiderateness of the male nature, ready at any moment to break out into unheard-of improprieties.
But the good man submitted himself to Miss Emily's rule, and suffered himself to be led about
by her with an air of half whimsical consciousness.

Mrs. Kittridge that day had felt the full delicacy of the compliment when she ascertained by
a hasty glance, before the first prayer, that the good man had been brought out to her funeral
in all his very best things, not excepting the long silk stockings, for she knew the second-best
pair by means of a certain skillful darn which Miss Emily had once shown her, which commemorated
the spot where a hole had been. The absence of this darn struck to Mrs. Kittridge's heart at
once as a delicate attention.

"Mis' Simpkins," said Mrs. Kittridge to her pastor, as they were seated at the tea-table, "told
me that she wished when you were going home that you would call in to see Mary Jane; she couldn't
come out to the funeral on account of a dreffle sore throat. I was tellin' on her to gargle
it with blackberry-root tea--don't you think that is a good gargle, Mr. Sewell?"

"Yes, I think it a very good gargle," replied the minister, gravely.

"Ma'sh rosemary is the gargle that I always use," said Miss Roxy; "it cleans out your throat so."

"Marsh rosemary is a very excellent gargle," said Mr. Sewell.

"Why, brother, don't you think that rose leaves and vitriol is a good gargle?" said little
Miss Emily; "I always thought that you liked rose leaves and vitriol for a gargle."

"So I do," said the imperturbable Mr. Sewell, drinking his tea with the air of a sphinx.

"Well, now, you'll have to tell which on 'em will be most likely to cure Mary Jane," said Captain
Kittridge, "or there'll be a pullin' of caps, I'm thinkin'; or else the poor girl will have
to drink them all, which is generally the way."

"There won't any of them cure Mary Jane's throat," said the minister, quietly.

"Why, brother!" "Why, Mr. Sewell!" "Why, you don't!" burst in different tones from each of
the women.

"I thought you said that blackberry-root tea was good," said Mrs. Kittridge.

"I understood that you 'proved of ma'sh rosemary," said Miss Roxy, touched in her professional
pride.

"And I am sure, brother, that I have heard you say, often and often, that there wasn't a better
gargle than rose leaves and vitriol," said Miss Emily.

"You are quite right, ladies, all of you. I think these are all good gargles--excellent ones."

"But I thought you said that they didn't do any good?" said all the ladies in a breath.

"No, they don't--not the least in the world," said Mr. Sewell; "but they are all excellent
gargles, and as long as people must have gargles, I think one is about as good as another."

"Now you have got it," said Captain Kittridge.

"Brother, you do say the strangest things," said Miss Emily.

"Well, I must say," said Miss Roxy, "it is a new idea to me, long as I've been nussin', and
I nussed through one season of scarlet fever when sometimes there was five died in one house;
and if ma'sh rosemary didn't do good then, I should like to know what did."

"So would a good many others," said the minister.

"Law, now, Miss Roxy, you mus'n't mind him. Do you know that I believe he says these sort of
things just to hear us talk? Of course he wouldn't think of puttin' his experience against yours."

"But, Mis' Kittridge," said Miss Emily, with a view of summoning a less controverted subject,
"what a beautiful little boy that was, and what a striking providence that brought him into
such a good family!"

"Yes," said Mrs. Kittridge; "but I'm sure I don't see what Mary Pennel is goin' to do with
that boy, for she ain't got no more government than a twisted tow-string."

"Oh, the Cap'n, he'll lend a hand," said Miss Roxy, "it won't be easy gettin' roun' him; Cap'n
bears a pretty steady hand when he sets out to drive."

"Well," said Miss Emily, "I do think that bringin' up children is the most awful responsibility,
and I always wonder when I hear that any one dares to undertake it."

"It requires a great deal of resolution, certainly," said Mrs. Kittridge; "I'm sure I used
to get a'most discouraged when my boys was young: they was a reg'lar set of wild ass's colts,"
she added, not perceiving the reflection on their paternity.

But the countenance of Mr. Sewell was all aglow with merriment, which did not break into a smile.

"Wal', Mis' Kittridge," said the Captain, "strikes me that you're gettin' pussonal."

"No, I ain't neither," said the literal Mrs. Kittridge, ignorant of the cause of the amusement
which she saw around her; "but you wa'n't no help to me, you know; you was always off to sea,
and the whole wear and tear on't came on me."

"Well, well, Polly, all's well that ends well; don't you think so, Mr. Sewell?"

"I haven't much experience in these matters," said Mr. Sewell, politely.

"No, indeed, that's what he hasn't, for he never will have a child round the house that he
don't turn everything topsy-turvy for them," said Miss Emily.

"But I was going to remark," said Mr. Sewell, "that a friend of mine said once, that the woman
that had brought up six boys deserved a seat among the martyrs; and that is rather my opinion."

"Wal', Polly, if you git up there, I hope you'll keep a seat for me."

"Cap'n Kittridge, what levity!" said his wife.

"I didn't begin it, anyhow," said the Captain.

Miss Emily interposed, and led the conversation back to the subject. "What a pity it is," she
said, "that this poor child's family can never know anything about him. There may be those
who would give all the world to know what has become of him; and when he comes to grow up,
how sad he will feel to have no father and mother!"

"Sister," said Mr. Sewell, "you cannot think that a child brought up by Captain Pennel and
his wife would ever feel as without father and mother."

"Why, no, brother, to be sure not. There's no doubt he will have everything done for him that
a child could. But then it's a loss to lose one's real home."

"It may be a gracious deliverance," said Mr. Sewell--"who knows? We may as well take a cheerful
view, and think that some kind wave has drifted the child away from an unfortunate destiny
to a family where we are quite sure he will be brought up industriously and soberly, and in
the fear of God."

"Well, I never thought of that," said Miss Roxy.

Miss Emily, looking at her brother, saw that he was speaking with a suppressed vehemence, as
if some inner fountain of recollection at the moment were disturbed. But Miss Emily knew no
more of the deeper parts of her brother's nature than a little bird that dips its beak into
the sunny waters of some spring knows of its depths of coldness and shadow.

"Mis' Pennel was a-sayin' to me," said Mrs. Kittridge, "that I should ask you what was to be
done about the bracelet they found. We don't know whether 'tis real gold and precious stones,
or only glass and pinchbeck. Cap'n Kittridge he thinks it's real; and if 'tis, why then the
question is, whether or no to try to sell it, or keep it for the boy agin he grows up. It may
help find out who and what he is."

"And why should he want to find out?" said Mr. Sewell. "Why should he not grow up and think
himself the son of Captain and Mrs. Pennel? What better lot could a boy be born to?"

"That may be, brother, but it can't be kept from him. Everybody knows how he was found, and
you may be sure every bird of the air will tell him, and he'll grow up restless and wanting
to know. Mis' Kittridge, have you got the bracelet handy?"

The fact was, little Miss Emily was just dying with curiosity to set her dancing black eyes
upon it.

"Here it is," said Mrs. Kittridge, taking it from a drawer.

It was a bracelet of hair, of some curious foreign workmanship. A green enameled serpent, studded
thickly with emeralds and with eyes of ruby, was curled around the clasp. A crystal plate covered
a wide flat braid of hair, on which the letters "D.M." were curiously embroidered in a cipher
of seed pearls. The whole was in style and workmanship quite different from any jewelry which
ordinarily meets one's eye.

But what was remarkable was the expression in Mr. Sewell's face when this bracelet was put
into his hand. Miss Emily had risen from table and brought it to him, leaning over him as she
did so, and he turned his head a little to hold it in the light from the window, so that only
she remarked the sudden expression of blank surprise and startled recognition which fell upon
it. He seemed like a man who chokes down an exclamation; and rising hastily, he took the bracelet
to the window, and standing with his back to the company, seemed to examine it with the minutest
interest. After a few moments he turned and said, in a very composed tone, as if the subject
were of no particular interest,--

"It is a singular article, so far as workmanship is concerned. The value of the gems in themselves
is not great enough to make it worth while to sell it. It will be worth more as a curiosity
than anything else. It will doubtless be an interesting relic to keep for the boy when he grows
up."

"Well, Mr. Sewell, you keep it," said Mrs. Kittridge; "the Pennels told me to give it into
your care."

"I shall commit it to Emily here; women have a native sympathy with anything in the jewelry
line. She'll be sure to lay it up so securely that she won't even know where it is herself."

"Brother!"

"Come, Emily," said Mr. Sewell, "your hens will all go to roost on the wrong perch if you are
not at home to see to them; so, if the Captain will set us across to Harpswell, I think we
may as well be going."

"Why, what's your hurry?" said Mrs. Kittridge.

"Well," said Mr. Sewell, "firstly, there's the hens; secondly, the pigs; and lastly, the cow.
Besides I shouldn't wonder if some of Emily's admirers should call on her this evening,--never
any saying when Captain Broad may come in."

"Now, brother, you are too bad," said Miss Emily, as she bustled about her bonnet and shawl.
"Now, that's all made up out of whole cloth. Captain Broad called last week a Monday, to talk
to you about the pews, and hardly spoke a word to me. You oughtn't to say such things, 'cause
it raises reports."

"Ah, well, then, I won't again," said her brother. "I believe, after all, it was Captain Badger
that called twice."

"Brother!"

"And left you a basket of apples the second time."

"Brother, you know he only called to get some of my hoarhound for Mehitable's cough."

"Oh, yes, I remember."

"If you don't take care," said Miss Emily, "I'll tell where you call."

"Come, Miss Emily, you must not mind him," said Miss Roxy; "we all know his ways."

And now took place the grand leave-taking, which consisted first of the three women's standing
in a knot and all talking at once, as if their very lives depended upon saying everything they
could possibly think of before they separated, while Mr. Sewell and Captain Kittridge stood
patiently waiting with the resigned air which the male sex commonly assume on such occasions;
and when, after two or three "Come, Emily's," the group broke up only to form again on the
door-step, where they were at it harder than ever, and a third occasion of the same sort took
place at the bottom of the steps, Mr. Sewell was at last obliged by main force to drag his
sister away in the middle of a sentence.

Miss Emily watched her brother shrewdly all the way home, but all traces of any uncommon feeling
had passed away; and yet, with the restlessness of female curiosity, she felt quite sure that
she had laid hold of the end of some skein of mystery, could she only find skill enough to
unwind it.

She took up the bracelet, and held it in the fading evening light, and broke into various observations
with regard to the singularity of the workmanship. Her brother seemed entirely absorbed in
talking with Captain Kittridge about the brig Anna Maria, which was going to be launched from
Pennel's wharf next Wednesday. But she, therefore, internally resolved to lie in wait for the
secret in that confidential hour which usually preceded going to bed. Therefore, as soon as
she had arrived at their quiet dwelling, she put in operation the most seducing little fire
that ever crackled and snapped in a chimney, well knowing that nothing was more calculated
to throw light into any hidden or concealed chamber of the soul than that enlivening blaze,
which danced so merrily on her well-polished andirons, and made the old chintz sofa and the
time-worn furniture so rich in remembrances of family comfort.

She then proceeded to divest her brother of his wig and his dress-coat, and to induct him into
the flowing ease of a study-gown, crowning his well-shaven head with a black cap, and placing
his slippers before the corner of a sofa nearest the fire. She observed him with satisfaction
sliding into his seat, and then she trotted to a closet with a glass door in the corner of
the room, and took down an old, quaintly-shaped silver cup, which had been an heirloom in their
family, and was the only piece of plate which their modern domestic establishment could boast;
and with this, down cellar she tripped, her little heels tapping lightly on each stair, and
the hum of a song coming back after her as she sought the cider-barrel. Up again she came,
and set the silver cup, with its clear amber contents, down by the fire, and then busied herself
in making just the crispest, nicest square of toast to be eaten with it; for Miss Emily had
conceived the idea that some little ceremony of this sort was absolutely necessary to do away
all possible ill effects from a day's labor, and secure an uninterrupted night's repose. Having
done all this, she took her knitting-work, and stationed herself just opposite to her brother.

It was fortunate for Miss Emily that the era of daily journals had not yet arisen upon the
earth, because if it had, after all her care and pains, her brother would probably have taken
up the evening paper, and holding it between his face and her, have read an hour or so in silence;
but Mr. Sewell had not this resort. He knew perfectly well that he had excited his sister's
curiosity on a subject where he could not gratify it, and therefore he took refuge in a kind
of mild, abstracted air of quietude which bid defiance to all her little suggestions.

After in vain trying every indirect form, Miss Emily approached the subject more pointedly.
"I thought that you looked very much interested in that poor woman to-day."

"She had an interesting face," said her brother, dryly.

"Was it like anybody that you ever saw?" said Miss Emily.

Her brother did not seem to hear her, but, taking the tongs, picked up the two ends of a stick
that had just fallen apart, and arranged them so as to make a new blaze.

Miss Emily was obliged to repeat her question, whereat he started as one awakened out of a
dream, and said,--

"Why, yes, he didn't know but she did; there were a good many women with black eyes and black
hair,--Mrs. Kittridge, for instance."

"Why, I don't think that she looked like Mrs. Kittridge in the least," said Miss Emily, warmly.

"Oh, well! I didn't say she did," said her brother, looking drowsily at his watch; "why, Emily,
it's getting rather late."

"What made you look so when I showed you that bracelet?" said Miss Emily, determined now to
push the war to the heart of the enemy's country.

"Look how?" said her brother, leisurely moistening a bit of toast in his cider.

"Why, I never saw anybody look more wild and astonished than you did for a minute or two."

"I did, did I?" said her brother, in the same indifferent tone. "My dear child, what an active
imagination you have. Did you ever look through a prism, Emily?"

"Why, no, Theophilus; what do you mean?"

"Well, if you should, you would see everybody and everything with a nice little bordering of
rainbow around them; now the rainbow isn't on the things, but in the prism."

"Well, what's that to the purpose?" said Miss Emily, rather bewildered.

"Why, just this: you women are so nervous and excitable, that you are very apt to see your
friends and the world in general with some coloring just as unreal. I am sorry for you, childie,
but really I can't help you to get up a romance out of this bracelet. Well, good-night, Emily;
take good care of yourself and go to bed;" and Mr. Sewell went to his room, leaving poor Miss
Emily almost persuaded out of the sight of her own eyes.

CHAPTER XI

LITTLE ADVENTURERS

The little boy who had been added to the family of Zephaniah Pennel and his wife soon became
a source of grave solicitude to that mild and long-suffering woman. For, as the reader may
have seen, he was a resolute, self-willed little elf, and whatever his former life may have
been, it was quite evident that these traits had been developed without any restraint.

Mrs. Pennel, whose whole domestic experience had consisted in rearing one very sensitive and
timid daughter, who needed for her development only an extreme of tenderness, and whose conscientiousness
was a law unto herself, stood utterly confounded before the turbulent little spirit to which
her loving-kindness had opened so ready an asylum, and she soon discovered that it is one thing
to take a human being to bring up, and another to know what to do with it after it is taken.

The child had the instinctive awe of Zephaniah which his manly nature and habits of command
were fitted to inspire, so that morning and evening, when he was at home, he was demure enough;
but while the good man was away all day, and sometimes on fishing excursions which often lasted
a week, there was a chronic state of domestic warfare--a succession of skirmishes, pitched
battles, long treaties, with divers articles of capitulation, ending, as treaties are apt to
do, in open rupture on the first convenient opportunity.

Mrs. Pennel sometimes reflected with herself mournfully, and with many self-disparaging sighs,
what was the reason that young master somehow contrived to keep her far more in awe of him
than he was of her. Was she not evidently, as yet at least, bigger and stronger than he, able
to hold his rebellious little hands, to lift and carry him, and to shut him up, if so she willed,
in a dark closet, and even to administer to him that discipline of the birch which Mrs. Kittridge
often and forcibly recommended as the great secret of her family prosperity? Was it not her
duty, as everybody told her, to break his will while he was young?--a duty which hung like
a millstone round the peaceable creature's neck, and weighed her down with a distressing sense
of responsibility.

Now, Mrs. Pennel was one of the people to whom self-sacrifice is constitutionally so much a
nature, that self-denial for her must have consisted in standing up for her own rights, or
having her own way when it crossed the will and pleasure of any one around her. All she wanted
of a child, or in fact of any human creature, was something to love and serve. We leave it
entirely to theologians to reconcile such facts with the theory of total depravity; but it
is a fact that there are a considerable number of women of this class. Their life would flow
on very naturally if it might consist only in giving, never in withholding--only in praise,
never in blame--only in acquiescence, never in conflict; and the chief comfort of such women
in religion is that it gives them at last an object for love without criticism, and for whom
the utmost degree of self-abandonment is not idolatry, but worship.

Mrs. Pennel would gladly have placed herself and all she possessed at the disposition of the
children; they might have broken her china, dug in the garden with her silver spoons, made
turf alleys in her best room, drummed on her mahogany tea-table, filled her muslin drawer with
their choicest shells and seaweed; only Mrs. Pennel knew that such kindness was no kindness,
and that in the dreadful word responsibility, familiar to every New England mother's ear, there
lay an awful summons to deny and to conflict where she could so much easier have conceded.

She saw that the tyrant little will would reign without mercy, if it reigned at all; and ever
present with her was the uneasy sense that it was her duty to bring this erratic little comet
within the laws of a well-ordered solar system,--a task to which she felt about as competent
as to make a new ring for Saturn. Then, too, there was a secret feeling, if the truth must
be told, of what Mrs. Kittridge would think about it; for duty is never more formidable than
when she gets on the cap and gown of a neighbor; and Mrs. Kittridge, with her resolute voice
and declamatory family government, had always been a secret source of uneasiness to poor Mrs.
Pennel, who was one of those sensitive souls who can feel for a mile or more the sphere of
a stronger neighbor. During all the years that they had lived side by side, there had been
this shadowy, unconfessed feeling on the part of poor Mrs. Pennel, that Mrs. Kittridge thought
her deficient in her favorite virtue of "resolution," as, in fact, in her inmost soul she knew
she was;--but who wants to have one's weak places looked into by the sharp eyes of a neighbor
who is strong precisely where we are weak? The trouble that one neighbor may give to another,
simply by living within a mile of one, is incredible; but until this new accession to her family,
Mrs. Pennel had always been able to comfort herself with the idea that the child under her
particular training was as well-behaved as any of those of her more demonstrative friend. But
now, all this consolation had been put to flight; she could not meet Mrs. Kittridge without
most humiliating recollections.

On Sundays, when those sharp black eyes gleamed upon her through the rails of the neighboring
pew, her very soul shrank within her, as she recollected all the compromises and defeats of
the week before. It seemed to her that Mrs. Kittridge saw it all,--how she had ingloriously
bought peace with gingerbread, instead of maintaining it by rightful authority,--how young
master had sat up till nine o'clock on divers occasions, and even kept little Mara up for his
lordly pleasure.

How she trembled at every movement of the child in the pew, dreading some patent and open impropriety
which should bring scandal on her government! This was the more to be feared, as the first
effort to initiate the youthful neophyte in the decorums of the sanctuary had proved anything
but a success,--insomuch that Zephaniah Pennel had been obliged to carry him out from the church;
therefore, poor Mrs. Pennel was thankful every Sunday when she got her little charge home without
any distinct scandal and breach of the peace.

But, after all, he was such a handsome and engaging little wretch, attracting all eyes wherever
he went, and so full of saucy drolleries, that it seemed to Mrs. Pennel that everything and
everybody conspired to help her spoil him. There are two classes of human beings in this world:
one class seem made to give love, and the other to take it. Now Mrs. Pennel and Mara belonged
to the first class, and little Master Moses to the latter.

It was, perhaps, of service to the little girl to give to her delicate, shrinking, highly nervous
organization the constant support of a companion so courageous, so richly blooded, and highly
vitalized as the boy seemed to be. There was a fervid, tropical richness in his air that gave
one a sense of warmth in looking at him, and made his Oriental name seem in good-keeping. He
seemed an exotic that might have waked up under fervid Egyptian suns, and been found cradled
among the lotus blossoms of old Nile; and the fair golden-haired girl seemed to be gladdened
by his companionship, as if he supplied an element of vital warmth to her being. She seemed
to incline toward him as naturally as a needle to a magnet.

The child's quickness of ear and the facility with which he picked up English were marvelous
to observe. Evidently, he had been somewhat accustomed to the sound of it before, for there
dropped out of his vocabulary, after he began to speak, phrases which would seem to betoken
a longer familiarity with its idioms than could be equally accounted for by his present experience.
Though the English evidently was not his native language, there had yet apparently been some
effort to teach it to him, although the terror and confusion of the shipwreck seemed at first
to have washed every former impression from his mind.

But whenever any attempt was made to draw him to speak of the past, of his mother, or of where
he came from, his brow lowered gloomily, and he assumed that kind of moody, impenetrable gravity,
which children at times will so strangely put on, and which baffle all attempts to look within
them. Zephaniah Pennel used to call it putting up his dead-lights. Perhaps it was the dreadful
association of agony and terror connected with the shipwreck, that thus confused and darkened
the mirror of his mind the moment it was turned backward; but it was thought wisest by his
new friends to avoid that class of subjects altogether--indeed, it was their wish that he might
forget the past entirely, and remember them as his only parents.

Miss Roxy and Miss Ruey came duly, as appointed, to initiate the young pilgrim into the habiliments
of a Yankee boy, endeavoring, at the same time, to drop into his mind such seeds of moral wisdom
as might make the internal economy in time correspond to the exterior. But Miss Roxy declared
that "of all the children that ever she see, he beat all for finding out new mischief,--the
moment you'd make him understand he mustn't do one thing, he was right at another."

One of his exploits, however, had very nearly been the means of cutting short the materials
of our story in the outset.

It was a warm, sunny afternoon, and the three women, being busy together with their stitching,
had tied a sun-bonnet on little Mara, and turned the two loose upon the beach to pick up shells.
All was serene, and quiet, and retired, and no possible danger could be apprehended. So up
and down they trotted, till the spirit of adventure which ever burned in the breast of little
Moses caught sight of a small canoe which had been moored just under the shadow of a cedar-covered
rock. Forthwith he persuaded his little neighbor to go into it, and for a while they made themselves
very gay, rocking it from side to side.

The tide was going out, and each retreating wave washed the boat up and down, till it came
into the boy's curly head how beautiful it would be to sail out as he had seen men do,--and
so, with much puffing and earnest tugging of his little brown hands, the boat at last was loosed
from her moorings and pushed out on the tide, when both children laughed gayly to find themselves
swinging and balancing on the amber surface, and watching the rings and sparkles of sunshine
and the white pebbles below. Little Moses was glorious,--his adventures had begun,--and with
a fairy-princess in his boat, he was going to stretch away to some of the islands of dreamland.
He persuaded Mara to give him her pink sun-bonnet, which he placed for a pennon on a stick
at the end of the boat, while he made a vehement dashing with another, first on one side of
the boat and then on the other,--spattering the water in diamond showers, to the infinite amusement
of the little maiden.

Meanwhile the tide waves danced them out and still outward, and as they went farther and farther
from shore, the more glorious felt the boy. He had got Mara all to himself, and was going away
with her from all grown people, who wouldn't let children do as they pleased,--who made them
sit still in prayer-time, and took them to meeting, and kept so many things which they must
not touch, or open, or play with. Two white sea-gulls came flying toward the children, and
they stretched their little arms in welcome, nothing doubting but these fair creatures were
coming at once to take passage with them for fairy-land. But the birds only dived and shifted
and veered, turning their silvery sides toward the sun, and careering in circles round the
children. A brisk little breeze, that came hurrying down from the land, seemed disposed to
favor their unsubstantial enterprise,--for your winds, being a fanciful, uncertain tribe of
people, are always for falling in with anything that is contrary to common sense. So the wind
trolled them merrily along, nothing doubting that there might be time, if they hurried, to
land their boat on the shore of some of the low-banked red clouds that lay in the sunset, where
they could pick up shells,--blue and pink and purple,--enough to make them rich for life. The
children were all excitement at the rapidity with which their little bark danced and rocked,
as it floated outward to the broad, open ocean; at the blue, freshening waves, at the silver-glancing
gulls, at the floating, white-winged ships, and at vague expectations of going rapidly somewhere,
to something more beautiful still. And what is the happiness of the brightest hours of grown
people more than this?

"Roxy," said Aunt Ruey innocently, "seems to me I haven't heard nothin' o' them children lately.
They're so still, I'm 'fraid there's some mischief."

"Well, Ruey, you jist go and give a look at 'em," said Miss Roxy. "I declare, that boy! I never
know what he will do next; but there didn't seem to be nothin' to get into out there but the
sea, and the beach is so shelving, a body can't well fall into that."

Alas! good Miss Roxy, the children are at this moment tilting up and down on the waves, half
a mile out to sea, as airily happy as the sea-gulls; and little Moses now thinks, with glorious
scorn, of you and your press-board, as of grim shadows of restraint and bondage that shall
never darken his free life more.

Both Miss Roxy and Mrs. Pennel were, however, startled into a paroxysm of alarm when poor Miss
Ruey came screaming, as she entered the door,--

"As sure as you're alive, them chil'en are off in the boat,--they're out to sea, sure as I'm
alive! What shall we do? The boat'll upset, and the sharks'll get 'em."

Miss Roxy ran to the window, and saw dancing and courtesying on the blue waves the little pinnace,
with its fanciful pink pennon fluttered gayly by the indiscreet and flattering wind.

Poor Mrs. Pennel ran to the shore, and stretched her arms wildly, as if she would have followed
them across the treacherous blue floor that heaved and sparkled between them.

"Oh, Mara, Mara! Oh, my poor little girl! Oh, poor children!"

"Well, if ever I see such a young un as that," soliloquized Miss Roxy from the chamber-window;
"there they be, dancin' and giggitin' about; they'll have the boat upset in a minit, and the
sharks are waitin' for 'em, no doubt. I b'lieve that ar young un's helped by the Evil One,--not
a boat round, else I'd push off after 'em. Well, I don't see but we must trust in the Lord,--there
don't seem to be much else to trust to," said the spinster, as she drew her head in grimly.

To say the truth, there was some reason for the terror of these most fearful suggestions; for
not far from the place where the children embarked was Zephaniah's fish-drying ground, and
multitudes of sharks came up with every rising tide, allured by the offal that was here constantly
thrown into the sea. June 22-- Austro-german ability continue Lemberg, choir of Galicia, which has been motor

1,630 serviceman and 520,000 mermen as convict, 300 Zolkiew, 770 car,
and vast abstraction of action.



That night, when Zephaniah, in his evening exercise, poured forth most fervent thanksgivings
for the deliverance, while Mrs. Pennel was sobbing in her handkerchief, Miss Roxy was much
scandalized by seeing the young cause of all the disturbance sitting upon his heels, regarding
the emotion of the kneeling party with his wide bright eyes, without a wink of compunction.

"Well, for her part," she said, "she hoped Cap'n Pennel would be blessed in takin' that ar
boy; but she was sure she didn't see much that looked like it now."

       *       *       *       *       *

The Rev. Mr. Sewell fished no more that day, for the draught from fairy-land with which he
had filled his boat brought up many thoughts into his mind, which he pondered anxiously.

"Strange ways of God," he thought, "that should send to my door this child, and should wash
upon the beach the only sign by which he could be identified. To what end or purpose? Hath
the Lord a will in this matter, and what is it?"

So he thought as he slowly rowed homeward, and so did his thoughts work upon him that half
way across the bay to Harpswell he slackened his oar without knowing it, and the boat lay drifting
on the purple and gold-tinted mirror, like a speck between two eternities. Under such circumstances,
even heads that have worn the clerical wig for years at times get a little dizzy and dreamy.
Perhaps it was because of the impression made upon him by the sudden apparition of those great
dark eyes and sable curls, that he now thought of the boy that he had found floating that afternoon,
looking as if some tropical flower had been washed landward by a monsoon; and as the boat rocked
and tilted, and the minister gazed dreamily downward into the wavering rings of purple, orange,
and gold which spread out and out from it, gradually it seemed to him that a face much like
the child's formed itself in the waters; but it was the face of a girl, young and radiantly
beautiful, yet with those same eyes and curls,--he saw her distinctly, with her thousand rings
of silky hair, bound with strings of pearls and clasped with strange gems, and she raised one
arm imploringly to him, and on the wrist he saw the bracelet embroidered with seed pearls,
and the letters D.M. "Ah, Dolores," he said, "well wert thou called so. Poor Dolores! I cannot
help thee."

"What am I dreaming of?" said the Rev. Mr. Sewell. "It is my Thursday evening lecture on Justification,
and Emily has got tea ready, and here I am catching cold out on the bay."

CHAPTER XII

SEA TALES

Mr. Sewell, as the reader may perhaps have inferred, was of a nature profoundly secretive.
It was in most things quite as pleasant for him to keep matters to himself, as it was to Miss
Emily to tell them to somebody else. She resembled more than anything one of those trotting,
chattering little brooks that enliven the "back lot" of many a New England home, while he was
like one of those wells you shall sometimes see by a deserted homestead, so long unused that
ferns and lichens feather every stone down to the dark, cool water.

Dear to him was the stillness and coolness of inner thoughts with which no stranger intermeddles;
dear to him every pendent fern-leaf of memory, every dripping moss of old recollection; and
though the waters of his soul came up healthy and refreshing enough when one really must have
them, yet one had to go armed with bucket and line and draw them up,--they never flowed. One
of his favorite maxims was, that the only way to keep a secret was never to let any one suspect
that you have one. And as he had one now, he had, as you have seen, done his best to baffle
and put to sleep the feminine curiosity of his sister.

He rather wanted to tell her, too, for he was a good-natured brother, and would have liked
to have given her the amount of pleasure the confidence would have produced; but then he reflected
with dismay on the number of women in his parish with whom Miss Emily was on tea-drinking terms,--he
thought of the wondrous solvent powers of that beverage in whose amber depths so many resolutions
yea, and solemn vows, of utter silence have been dissolved like Cleopatra's pearls. He knew
that an infusion of his secret would steam up from every cup of tea Emily should drink for
six months to come, till gradually every particle would be dissolved and float in the air of
common fame. No; it would not do.

You would have thought, however, that something was the matter with Mr. Sewell, had you seen
him after he retired for the night, after he had so very indifferently dismissed the subject
of Miss Emily's inquiries. For instead of retiring quietly to bed, as had been his habit for
years at that hour, he locked his door, and then unlocked a desk of private papers, and emptied
certain pigeon-holes of their contents, and for an hour or two sat unfolding and looking over
old letters and papers; and when all this was done, he pushed them from him, and sat for a
long time buried in thoughts which went down very, very deep into that dark and mossy well
of which we have spoken.

Then he took a pen and wrote a letter, and addressed it to a direction for which he had searched
through many piles of paper, and having done so, seemed to ponder, uncertainly, whether to
send it or not. The Harpswell post-office was kept in Mr. Silas Perrit's store, and the letters
were every one of them carefully and curiously investigated by all the gossips of the village,
and as this was addressed to St. Augustine in Florida, he foresaw that before Sunday the news
would be in every mouth in the parish that the minister had written to so and so in Florida,
"and what do you s'pose it's about?"

"No, no," he said to himself, "that will never do; but at all events there is no hurry," and
he put back the papers in order, put the letter with them, and locking his desk, looked at
his watch and found it to be two o'clock, and so he went to bed to think the matter over.

Now, there may be some reader so simple as to feel a portion of Miss Emily's curiosity. But,
my friend, restrain it, for Mr. Sewell will certainly, as we foresee, become less rather than
more communicative on this subject, as he thinks upon it. Nevertheless, whatever it be that
he knows or suspects, it is something which leads him to contemplate with more than usual interest
this little mortal waif that has so strangely come ashore in his parish. He mentally resolves
to study the child as minutely as possible, without betraying that he has any particular reason
for being interested in him.

Therefore, in the latter part of this mild November afternoon, which he has devoted to pastoral
visiting, about two months after the funeral, he steps into his little sail-boat, and stretches
away for the shores of Orr's Island. He knows the sun will be down before he reaches there;
but he sees, in the opposite horizon, the spectral, shadowy moon, only waiting for daylight
to be gone to come out, calm and radiant, like a saintly friend neglected in the flush of prosperity,
who waits patiently to enliven our hours of darkness.

As his boat-keel grazed the sands on the other side, a shout of laughter came upon his oar
from behind a cedar-covered rock, and soon emerged Captain Kittridge, as long and lean and
brown as the Ancient Mariner, carrying little Mara on one shoulder, while Sally and little
Moses Pennel trotted on before.

It was difficult to say who in this whole group was in the highest spirits. The fact was that
Mrs. Kittridge had gone to a tea-drinking over at Maquoit, and left the Captain as housekeeper
and general overseer; and little Mara and Moses and Sally had been gloriously keeping holiday
with him down by the boat-cove, where, to say the truth, few shavings were made, except those
necessary to adorn the children's heads with flowing suits of curls of a most extraordinary
effect. The aprons of all of them were full of these most unsubstantial specimens of woody
treasure, which hung out in long festoons, looking of a yellow transparency in the evening
light. But the delight of the children in their acquisitions was only equaled by that of grown-up
people in possessions equally fanciful in value.

The mirth of the little party, however, came to a sudden pause as they met the minister. Mara
clung tight to the Captain's neck, and looked out slyly under her curls. But the little Moses
made a step forward, and fixed his bold, dark, inquisitive eyes upon him. The fact was, that
the minister had been impressed upon the boy, in his few visits to the "meeting," as such a
grand and mysterious reason for good behavior, that he seemed resolved to embrace the first
opportunity to study him close at hand.

"Well, my little man," said Mr. Sewell, with an affability which he could readily assume with
children, "you seem to like to look at me."

"I do like to look at you," said the boy gravely, continuing to fix his great black eyes upon him.

"I see you do, my little fellow."

"Are you the Lord?" said the child, solemnly.

"Am I what?"

"The Lord," said the boy.

"No, indeed, my lad," said Mr. Sewell, smiling. "Why, what put that into your little head?"

"I thought you were," said the boy, still continuing to study the pastor with attention. "Miss
Roxy said so."

"It's curious what notions chil'en will get in their heads," said Captain Kittridge. "They
put this and that together and think it over, and come out with such queer things."

"But," said the minister, "I have brought something for you all;" saying which he drew from
his pocket three little bright-cheeked apples, and gave one to each child; and then taking
the hand of the little Moses in his own, he walked with him toward the house-door.

Mrs. Pennel was sitting in her clean kitchen, busily spinning at the little wheel, and rose
flushed with pleasure at the honor that was done her.

"Pray, walk in, Mr. Sewell," she said, rising, and leading the way toward the penetralia of
the best room.

"Now, Mrs. Pennel, I am come here for a good sit-down by your kitchen-fire, this evening,"
said Mr. Sewell. "Emily has gone out to sit with old Mrs. Broad, who is laid up with the rheumatism,
and so I am turned loose to pick up my living on the parish, and you must give me a seat for
a while in your kitchen corner. Best rooms are always cold."

"The minister's right," said Captain Kittridge. "When rooms ain't much set in, folks never
feel so kind o' natural in 'em. So you jist let me put on a good back-log and forestick, and
build up a fire to tell stories by this evening. My wife's gone out to tea, too," he said,
with an elastic skip.

And in a few moments the Captain had produced in the great cavernous chimney a foundation for
a fire that promised breadth, solidity, and continuance. A great back-log, embroidered here
and there with tufts of green or grayish moss, was first flung into the capacious arms of the
fireplace, and a smaller log placed above it. "Now, all you young uns go out and bring in chips,"
said the Captain. "There's capital ones out to the wood-pile."

Mr. Sewell was pleased to see the flash that came from the eyes of little Moses at this order,
how energetically he ran before the others, and came with glowing cheeks and distended arms,
throwing down great white chips with their green mossy bark, scattering tufts on the floor.
"Good," said he softly to himself, as he leaned on the top of his gold-headed cane; "there's
energy, ambition, muscle;" and he nodded his head once or twice to some internal decision.

"There!" said the Captain, rising out of a perfect whirlwind of chips and pine kindlings with
which in his zeal he had bestrown the wide, black stone hearth, and pointing to the tongues
of flame that were leaping and blazing up through the crevices of the dry pine wood which he
had intermingled plentifully with the more substantial fuel,--"there, Mis' Pennel, ain't I
a master-hand at a fire? But I'm really sorry I've dirtied your floor," he said, as he brushed
down his pantaloons, which were covered with bits of grizzly moss, and looked on the surrounding
desolations; "give me a broom, I can sweep up now as well as any woman."

"Oh, never mind," said Mrs. Pennel, laughing, "I'll sweep up."

"Well, now, Mis' Pennel, you're one of the women that don't get put out easy; ain't ye?" said
the Captain, still contemplating his fire with a proud and watchful eye.

"Law me!" he exclaimed, glancing through the window, "there's the Cap'n a-comin'. I'm jist
goin' to give a look at what he's brought in. Come, chil'en," and the Captain disappeared with
all three of the children at his heels, to go down to examine the treasures of the fishing-smack.

Mr. Sewell seated himself cozily in the chimney corner and sank into a state of half-dreamy
reverie; his eyes fixed on the fairest sight one can see of a frosty autumn twilight--a crackling
wood-fire.

Mrs. Pennel moved soft-footed to and fro, arraying her tea-table in her own finest and pure
damask, and bringing from hidden stores her best china and newest silver, her choicest sweetmeats
and cake--whatever was fairest and nicest in her house--to honor her unexpected guest.

 "But, as I was sayin', he came up to me,
and made the politest bow that ever ye see, and says he, 'Cap'n Kittridge, I presume,' and
says I, 'Yes, sir.' 'I'm sorry to interrupt your reading,' says he; and says I, 'Oh, no matter,
sir.' 'But,' says he, 'if you would only be so good as to move your anchor. You've cast anchor
right before my front-door, and my wife and family can't get out to go to meetin'.'"

"Why, do they go to meeting in the bottom of the sea?" said Moses.

"Law, bless you sonny, yes. Why, Sunday morning, when the sea was all still, I used to hear
the bass-viol a-soundin' down under the waters, jist as plain as could be,--and psalms and
preachin'. I've reason to think there's as many hopefully pious mermaids as there be folks,"
said the Captain.

"But," said Moses, "you said the anchor was before the front-door, so the family couldn't get
out,--how did the merman get out?"

"Oh! he got out of the scuttle on the roof," said the Captain, promptly.

"And did you move your anchor?" said Moses.

"Why, child, yes, to be sure I did; he was such a gentleman I wanted to oblige him,--it shows
you how important it is always to be polite," said the Captain, by way of giving a moral turn
to his narrative.

Mr. Sewell, during the progress of this story, examined the Captain with eyes of amused curiosity.
His countenance was as fixed and steady, and his whole manner of reciting as matter-of-fact
and collected, as if he were relating some of the every-day affairs of his boat-building.

"Wal', Sally," said the Captain, rising, after his yarn had proceeded for an indefinite length
in this manner, "you and I must be goin'. I promised your ma you shouldn't be up late, and
we have a long walk home,--besides it's time these little folks was in bed."

The children all clung round the Captain, and could hardly be persuaded to let him go.

When he was gone, Mrs. Pennel took the little ones to their nest in an adjoining room.

Mr. Sewell approached his chair to that of Captain Pennel, and began talking to him in a tone
of voice so low, that we have never been able to make out exactly what he was saying. Whatever
it might be, however, it seemed to give rise to an anxious consultation. "I did not think it
advisable to tell any one this but yourself, Captain Pennel. It is for you to decide, in view
of the probabilities I have told you, what you will do."

"Well," said Zephaniah, "since you leave it to me, I say, let us keep him. It certainly seems
a marked providence that he has been thrown upon us as he has, and the Lord seemed to prepare
a way for him in our hearts. I am well able to afford it, and Mis' Pennel, she agrees to it,
and on the whole I don't think we'd best go back on our steps; besides, our little Mara has
thrived since he came under our roof. He is, to be sure, kind o' masterful, and I shall have
to take him off Mis' Pennel's hands before long, and put him into the sloop. But, after all,
there seems to be the makin' of a man in him, and when we are called away, why he'll be as
a brother to poor little Mara. Yes, I think it's best as 't is."

The minister, as he flitted across the bay by moonlight, felt relieved of a burden. His secret
was locked up as safe in the breast of Zephaniah Pennel as it could be in his own.

CHAPTER XIII

BOY AND GIRL

Zephaniah Pennel was what might be called a Hebrew of the Hebrews.

New England, in her earlier days, founding her institutions on the Hebrew Scriptures, bred
better Jews than Moses could, because she read Moses with the amendments of Christ.

The state of society in some of the districts of Maine, in these days, much resembled in its
spirit that which Moses labored to produce in ruder ages. It was entirely democratic, simple,
grave, hearty, and sincere,--solemn and religious in its daily tone, and yet, as to all material
good, full of wholesome thrift and prosperity. Perhaps, taking the average mass of the people,
a more healthful and desirable state of society never existed. Its better specimens had a simple
Doric grandeur unsurpassed in any age. The bringing up a child in this state of society was
a far more simple enterprise than in our modern times, when the factious wants and aspirations
are so much more developed.

Zephaniah Pennel was as high as anybody in the land. He owned not only the neat little schooner,
"Brilliant," with divers small fishing-boats, but also a snug farm, adjoining the brown house,
together with some fresh, juicy pasture-lots on neighboring islands, where he raised mutton,
unsurpassed even by the English South-down, and wool, which furnished homespun to clothe his
family on all every-day occasions.

Mrs. Pennel, to be sure, had silks and satins, and flowered India chintz, and even a Cashmere
shawl, the fruits of some of her husband's earlier voyages, which were, however, carefully
stowed away for occasions so high and mighty, that they seldom saw the light. Not to wear best
things every day was a maxim of New England thrift as little disputed as any verse of the catechism;
and so Mrs. Pennel found the stuff gown of her own dyeing and spinning so respectable for most
purposes, that it figured even in the meeting-house itself, except on the very finest of Sundays,
when heaven and earth seemed alike propitious. A person can well afford to wear homespun stuff
to meeting, who is buoyed up by a secret consciousness of an abundance of fine things that
could be worn, if one were so disposed, and everybody respected Mrs. Pennel's homespun the
more, because they thought of the things she didn't wear.

As to advantages of education, the island, like all other New England districts, had its common
school, where one got the key of knowledge,--for having learned to read, write, and cipher,
the young fellow of those regions commonly regarded himself as in possession of all that a
man needs, to help himself to any further acquisitions he might desire. The boys then made
fishing voyages to the Banks, and those who were so disposed took their books with them. If
a boy did not wish to be bored with study, there was nobody to force him; but if a bright one
saw visions of future success in life lying through the avenues of knowledge, he found many
a leisure hour to pore over his books, and work out the problems of navigation directly over
the element they were meant to control.

Four years having glided by since the commencement of our story, we find in the brown house
of Zephaniah Pennel a tall, well-knit, handsome boy of ten years, who knows no fear of wind
or sea; who can set you over from Orr's Island to Harpswell, either in sail or row-boat, he
thinks, as well as any man living; who knows every rope of the schooner Brilliant, and fancies
he could command it as well as "father" himself; and is supporting himself this spring, during
the tamer drudgeries of driving plough, and dropping potatoes, with the glorious vision of
being taken this year on the annual trip to "the Banks," which comes on after planting. He
reads fluently,--witness the "Robinson Crusoe," which never departs from under his pillow,
and Goldsmith's "History of Greece and Rome," which good Mr. Sewell has lent him,--and he often
brings shrewd criticisms on the character and course of Romulus or Alexander into the common
current of every-day life, in a way that brings a smile over the grave face of Zephaniah, and
makes Mrs. Pennel think the boy certainly ought to be sent to college.

As for Mara, she is now a child of seven, still adorned with long golden curls, still looking
dreamily out of soft hazel eyes into some unknown future not her own. She has no dreams for
herself--they are all for Moses. For his sake she has learned all the womanly little accomplishments
which Mrs. Kittridge has dragooned into Sally. She knits his mittens and his stockings, and
hems his pocket-handkerchiefs, and aspires to make his shirts all herself. Whatever book Moses
reads, forthwith she aspires to read too, and though three years younger, reads with a far
more precocious insight.

Her little form is slight and frail, and her cheek has a clear transparent brilliancy quite
different from the rounded one of the boy; she looks not exactly in ill health, but has that
sort of transparent appearance which one fancies might be an attribute of fairies and sylphs.
All her outward senses are finer and more acute than his, and finer and more delicate all the
attributes of her mind. Those who contend against giving woman the same education as man do
it on the ground that it would make the woman unfeminine, as if Nature had done her work so
slightly that it could be so easily raveled and knit over. In fact, there is a masculine and
a feminine element in all knowledge, and a man and a woman put to the same study extract only
what their nature fits them to see, so that knowledge can be fully orbed only when the two
unite in the search and share the spoils.

When Moses was full of Romulus and Numa, Mara pondered the story of the nymph Egeria--sweet
parable, in which lies all we have been saying. Her trust in him was boundless. He was a constant
hero in her eyes, and in her he found a steadfast believer as to all possible feats and exploits
to which he felt himself competent, for the boy often had privately assured her that he could
command the Brilliant as well as father himself.

Spring had already come, loosing the chains of ice in all the bays and coves round Harpswell,
Orr's Island, Maquoit, and Middle Bay. The magnificent spruces stood forth in their gala-dresses,
tipped on every point with vivid emerald; the silver firs exuded from their tender shoots the
fragrance of ripe pineapple; the white pines shot forth long weird fingers at the end of their
fringy boughs; and even every little mimic evergreen in the shadows at their feet was made
beautiful by the addition of a vivid border of green on the sombre coloring of its last year's
leaves. Arbutus, fragrant with its clean, wholesome odors, gave forth its thousand dewy pink
blossoms, and the trailing Linnea borealis hung its pendent twin bells round every mossy stump
and old rock damp with green forest mould. The green and vermilion matting of the partridge-berry
was impearled with white velvet blossoms, the checkerberry hung forth a translucent bell under
its varnished green leaf, and a thousand more fairy bells, white or red, hung on blueberry
and huckleberry bushes. The little Pearl of Orr's Island had wandered many an hour gathering
bouquets of all these, to fill the brown house with sweetness when her grandfather and Moses
should come in from work.

The love of flowers seemed to be one of her earliest characteristics, and the young spring
flowers of New England, in their airy delicacy and fragility, were much like herself; and so
strong seemed the affinity between them, that not only Mrs. Pennel's best India china vases
on the keeping-room mantel were filled, but here stood a tumbler of scarlet rock columbine,
and there a bowl of blue and white violets, and in another place a saucer of shell-tinted crowfoot,
blue liverwort, and white anemone, so that Zephaniah Pennel was wont to say there wasn't a
drink of water to be got, for Mara's flowers; but he always said it with a smile that made
his weather-beaten, hard features look like a rock lit up by a sunbeam. Little Mara was the
pearl of the old seaman's life, every finer particle of his nature came out in her concentrated
and polished, and he often wondered at a creature so ethereal belonging to him--as if down
on some shaggy sea-green rock an old pearl oyster should muse and marvel on the strange silvery
mystery of beauty that was growing in the silence of his heart.

But May has passed; the arbutus and the Linnea are gone from the woods, and the pine tips have
grown into young shoots, which wilt at noon under a direct reflection from sun and sea, and
the blue sky has that metallic clearness and brilliancy which distinguishes those regions,
and the planting is at last over, and this very morning Moses is to set off in the Brilliant
for his first voyage to the Banks. Glorious knight he! the world all before him, and the blood
of ten years racing and throbbing in his veins as he talks knowingly of hooks, and sinkers,
and bait, and lines, and wears proudly the red flannel shirt which Mara had just finished for him.

"How I do wish I were going with you!" she says. "I could do something, couldn't I--take care
of your hooks, or something?"

"Pooh!" said Moses, sublimely regarding her while he settled the collar of his shirt, "you're
a girl; and what can girls do at sea? you never like to catch fish--it always makes you cry
to see 'em flop."

"Oh, yes, poor fish!" said Mara, perplexed between her sympathy for the fish and her desire
for the glory of her hero, which must be founded on their pain; "I can't help feeling sorry
when they gasp so."

"Well, and what do you suppose you would do when the men are pulling up twenty and forty pounder?"
said Moses, striding sublimely. "Why, they flop so, they'd knock you over in a minute."

"Do they? Oh, Moses, do be careful. What if they should hurt you?"

"Hurt me!" said Moses, laughing; "that's a good one. I'd like to see a fish that could hurt me."

"Do hear that boy talk!" said Mrs. Pennel to her husband, as they stood within their chamber-door.

"Yes, yes," said Captain Pennel, smiling; "he's full of the matter. I believe he'd take the
command of the schooner this morning, if I'd let him."

The Brilliant lay all this while courtesying on the waves, which kissed and whispered to the
little coquettish craft. A fairer June morning had not risen on the shores that week; the blue
mirror of the ocean was all dotted over with the tiny white sails of fishing-craft bound on
the same errand, and the breeze that was just crisping the waters had the very spirit of energy
and adventure in it.

Everything and everybody was now on board, and she began to spread her fair wings, and slowly
and gracefully to retreat from the shore. Little Moses stood on the deck, his black curls blowing
in the wind, and his large eyes dancing with excitement,--his clear olive complexion and glowing
cheeks well set off by his red shirt.

Mrs. Pennel stood with Mara on the shore to see them go. The fair little golden-haired Ariadne
shaded her eyes with one arm, and stretched the other after her Theseus, till the vessel grew
smaller, and finally seemed to melt away into the eternal blue. Many be the wives and lovers
that have watched those little fishing-craft as they went gayly out like this, but have waited
long--too long--and seen them again no more. In night and fog they have gone down under the
keel of some ocean packet or Indiaman, and sunk with brave hearts and hands, like a bubble
in the mighty waters. Yet Mrs. Pennel did not turn back to her house in apprehension of this.
Her husband had made so many voyages, and always returned safely, that she confidently expected
before long to see them home again.

The next Sunday the seat of Zephaniah Pennel was vacant in church. According to custom, a note
was put up asking prayers for his safe return, and then everybody knew that he was gone to
the Banks; and as the roguish, handsome face of Moses was also missing, Miss Roxy whispered
to Miss Ruey, "There! Captain Pennel's took Moses on his first voyage. We must contrive to
call round on Mis' Pennel afore long. She'll be lonesome."

Sunday evening Mrs. Pennel was sitting pensively with little Mara by the kitchen hearth, where
they had been boiling the tea-kettle for their solitary meal. They heard a brisk step without,
and soon Captain and Mrs. Kittridge made their appearance.

"Good evening, Mis' Pennel," said the Captain; "I's a-tellin' my good woman we must come down
and see how you's a-getting along. It's raly a work of necessity and mercy proper for the Lord's
day. Rather lonesome, now the Captain's gone, ain't ye? Took little Moses, too, I see. Wasn't
at meetin' to-day, so I says, Mis' Kittridge, we'll just step down and chirk 'em up a little."

"I didn't really know how to come," said Mrs. Kittridge, as she allowed Mrs. Pennel to take
her bonnet; "but Aunt Roxy's to our house now, and she said she'd see to Sally. So you've let
the boy go to the Banks? He's young, ain't he, for that?"

"Not a bit of it," said Captain Kittridge. "Why, I was off to the Banks long afore I was his
age, and a capital time we had of it, too. Golly! how them fish did bite! We stood up to our
knees in fish before we'd fished half an hour."

Mara, who had always a shy affinity for the Captain, now drew towards him and climbed on his
knee. "Did the wind blow very hard?" she said.

"What, my little maid?"

"Does the wind blow at the Banks?"

"Why, yes, my little girl, that it does, sometimes; but then there ain't the least danger.
Our craft ride out storms like live creatures. I've stood it out in gales that was tight enough,
I'm sure. 'Member once I turned in 'tween twelve and one, and hadn't more'n got asleep, afore
I came clump out of my berth, and found everything upside down. And 'stead of goin' upstairs
to get on deck, I had to go right down. Fact was, that 'ere vessel jist turned clean over in
the water, and come right side up like a duck."

"Well, now, Cap'n, I wouldn't be tellin' such a story as that," said his helpmeet.

"Why, Polly, what do you know about it? you never was to sea. We did turn clear over, for I
'member I saw a bunch of seaweed big as a peck measure stickin' top of the mast next day. Jist
shows how safe them ar little fishing craft is,--for all they look like an egg-shell on the
mighty deep, as Parson Sewell calls it."

"I was very much pleased with Mr. Sewell's exercise in prayer this morning," said Mrs. Kittridge;
"it must have been a comfort to you, Mis' Pennel."

"It was, to be sure," said Mrs. Pennel.

"Puts me in mind of poor Mary Jane Simpson. Her husband went out, you know, last June, and
hain't been heard of since. Mary Jane don't really know whether to put on mourning or not."

"Law! I don't think Mary Jane need give up yet," said the Captain. "'Member one year I was
out, we got blowed clear up to Baffin's Bay, and got shut up in the ice, and had to go ashore
and live jist as we could among them Esquimaux. Didn't get home for a year. Old folks had clean
giv' us up. Don't need never despair of folks gone to sea, for they's sure to turn up, first
or last."

"But I hope," said Mara, apprehensively, "that grandpapa won't get blown up to Baffin's Bay.
I've seen that on his chart,--it's a good ways."

"And then there's them 'ere icebergs," said Mrs. Kittridge; "I'm always 'fraid of running into
them in the fog."

"Law!" said Captain Kittridge, "I've met 'em bigger than all the colleges up to Brunswick,--great
white bears on 'em,--hungry as Time in the Primer. Once we came kersmash on to one of 'em,
and if the Flying Betsey hadn't been made of whalebone and injer-rubber, she'd a-been stove
all to pieces. Them white bears, they was so hungry, that they stood there with the water jist
runnin' out of their chops in a perfect stream."

"Oh, dear, dear," said Mara, with wide round eyes, "what will Moses do if they get on the icebergs?"

"Yes," said Mrs. Kittridge, looking solemnly at the child through the black bows of her spectacles,
"we can truly say:--

    "'Dangers stand thick through all the ground,
        To push us to the tomb,'

as the hymn-book says."

The kind-hearted Captain, feeling the fluttering heart of little Mara, and seeing the tears
start in her eyes, addressed himself forthwith to consolation. "Oh, never you mind, Mara,"
he said, "there won't nothing hurt 'em. Look at me. Why, I've been everywhere on the face of
the earth. I've been on icebergs, and among white bears and Indians, and seen storms that would
blow the very hair off your head, and here I am, dry and tight as ever. You'll see 'em back
before long."

The cheerful laugh with which the Captain was wont to chorus his sentences sounded like the
crackling of dry pine wood on the social hearth. One would hardly hear it without being lightened
in heart; and little Mara gazed at his long, dry, ropy figure, and wrinkled thin face, as a
sort of monument of hope; and his uproarious laugh, which Mrs. Kittridge sometimes ungraciously
compared to "the crackling of thorns under a pot," seemed to her the most delightful thing
in the world.

"Mary Jane was a-tellin' me," resumed Mrs. Kittridge, "that when her husband had been out a
month, she dreamed she see him, and three other men, a-floatin' on an iceberg."

"Laws," said Captain Kittridge, "that's jist what my old mother dreamed about me, and 'twas
true enough, too, till we got off the ice on to the shore up in the Esquimaux territory, as
I was a-tellin'. So you tell Mary Jane she needn't look out for a second husband yet, for that
ar dream's a sartin sign he'll be back."

"Cap'n Kittridge!" said his helpmeet, drawing herself up, and giving him an austere glance
over her spectacles; "how often must I tell you that there is subjects which shouldn't be treated
with levity?"

"Who's been a-treatin' of 'em with levity?" said the Captain. "I'm sure I ain't. Mary Jane's
good-lookin', and there's plenty of young fellows as sees it as well as me. I declare, she
looked as pretty as any young gal when she ris up in the singers' seats to-day. Put me in mind
of you, Polly, when I first come home from the Injies."

"Oh, come now, Cap'n Kittridge! we're gettin' too old for that sort o' talk."

"We ain't too old, be we, Mara?" said the Captain, trotting the little girl gayly on his knee;
"and we ain't afraid of icebergs and no sich, be we? I tell you they's a fine sight of a bright
day; they has millions of steeples, all white and glistering, like the New Jerusalem, and the
white bears have capital times trampin' round on 'em. Wouldn't little Mara like a great, nice
white bear to ride on, with his white fur, so soft and warm, and a saddle made of pearls, and
a gold bridle?"

She invented long dramas and conversations in which they performed imaginary parts, and it
would not have appeared to the child in the least degree surprising either to have met an angel
in the woods, or to have formed an intimacy with some talking wolf or bear, such as she read
of in Æsop's Fables.

One day, as she was exploring the garret, she found in an old barrel of cast-off rubbish a
bit of reading which she begged of her grandmother for her own. It was the play of the "Tempest,"
torn from an old edition of Shakespeare, and was in that delightfully fragmentary condition
which most particularly pleases children, because they conceive a mutilated treasure thus found
to be more especially their own property--something like a rare wild-flower or sea-shell. The
pleasure which thoughtful and imaginative children sometimes take in reading that which they
do not and cannot fully comprehend is one of the most common and curious phenomena of childhood.

And so little Mara would lie for hours stretched out on the pebbly beach, with the broad open
ocean before her and the whispering pines and hemlocks behind her, and pore over this poem,
from which she collected dim, delightful images of a lonely island, an old enchanter, a beautiful
girl, and a spirit not quite like those in the Bible, but a very probable one to her mode of
thinking. As for old Caliban, she fancied him with a face much like that of a huge skate-fish
she had once seen drawn ashore in one of her grandfather's nets; and then there was the beautiful
young Prince Ferdinand, much like what Moses would be when he was grown up--and how glad she
would be to pile up his wood for him, if any old enchanter should set him to work!

One attribute of the child was a peculiar shamefacedness and shyness about her inner thoughts,
and therefore the wonder that this new treasure excited, the host of surmises and dreams to
which it gave rise, were never mentioned to anybody. That it was all of it as much authentic
fact as the Roman history, she did not doubt, but whether it had happened on Orr's Island or
some of the neighboring ones, she had not exactly made up her mind. She resolved at her earliest
leisure to consult Captain Kittridge on the subject, wisely considering that it much resembled
some of his fishy and aquatic experiences.

Some of the little songs fixed themselves in her memory, and she would hum them as she wandered
up and down the beach.

    "Come unto these yellow sands,
      And then take hands;
    Courtsied when you have and kissed
      The wild waves whist,
    Foot it featly here and there;
    And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear."

These words she pondered very long, gravely revolving in her little head whether they described
the usual course of things in the mysterious under-world that lay beneath that blue spangled
floor of the sea; whether everybody's eyes changed to pearl, and their bones to coral, if they
sunk down there; and whether the sea-nymphs spoken of were the same as the mermaids that Captain
Kittridge had told of. Had he not said that the bell rung for church of a Sunday morning down
under the waters?

Mara vividly remembered the scene on the sea-beach, the finding of little Moses and his mother,
the dream of the pale lady that seemed to bring him to her; and not one of the conversations
that had transpired before her among different gossips had been lost on her quiet, listening
little ears. These pale, still children that play without making any noise are deep wells into
which drop many things which lie long and quietly on the bottom, and come up in after years
whole and new, when everybody else has forgotten them.

So she had heard surmises as to the remaining crew of that unfortunate ship, where, perhaps,
Moses had a father. And sometimes she wondered if he were lying fathoms deep with sea-nymphs
ringing his knell, and whether Moses ever thought about him; and yet she could no more have
asked him a question about it than if she had been born dumb. She decided that she should never
show him this poetry--it might make him feel unhappy.

One bright afternoon, when the sea lay all dead asleep, and the long, steady respiration of
its tides scarcely disturbed the glassy tranquillity of its bosom, Mrs. Pennel sat at her kitchen-door
spinning, when Captain Kittridge appeared.

"Good afternoon, Mis' Pennel; how ye gettin' along?"

"Oh, pretty well, Captain; won't you walk in and have a glass of beer?"

"Well, thank you," said the Captain, raising his hat and wiping his forehead, "I be pretty
dry, it's a fact."

Mrs. Pennel hastened to a cask which was kept standing in a corner of the kitchen, and drew
from thence a mug of her own home-brewed, fragrant with the smell of juniper, hemlock, and
wintergreen, which she presented to the Captain, who sat down in the doorway and discussed
it in leisurely sips.

"Wal', s'pose it's most time to be lookin' for 'em home, ain't it?" he said.

"I am lookin' every day," said Mrs. Pennel, involuntarily glancing upward at the sea.

At the word appeared the vision of little Mara, who rose up like a spirit from a dusky corner,
where she had been stooping over her reading.

"Why, little Mara," said the Captain, "you ris up like a ghost all of a sudden. I thought you's
out to play. I come down a-purpose arter you. Mis' Kittridge has gone shoppin' up to Brunswick,
and left Sally a 'stent' to do; and I promised her if she'd clap to and do it quick, I'd go
up and fetch you down, and we'd have a play in the cove."

Mara's eyes brightened, as they always did at this prospect, and Mrs. Pennel said, "Well, I'm
glad to have the child go; she seems so kind o' still and lonesome since Moses went away; really
one feels as if that boy took all the noise there was with him. I get tired myself sometimes
hearing the clock tick. Mara, when she's alone, takes to her book more than's good for a child."

"She does, does she? Well, we'll see about that. Come, little Mara, get on your sun-bonnet.
Sally's sewin' fast as ever she can, and we're goin' to dig some clams, and make a fire, and
have a chowder; that'll be nice, won't it? Don't you want to come, too, Mis' Pennel?"

"Oh, thank you, Captain, but I've got so many things on hand to do afore they come home, I
don't really think I can. I'll trust Mara to you any day."

Mara had run into her own little room and secured her precious fragment of treasure, which
she wrapped up carefully in her handkerchief, resolving to enlighten Sally with the story,
and to consult the Captain on any nice points of criticism. Arrived at the cove, they found
Sally already there in advance of them, clapping her hands and dancing in a manner which made
her black elf-locks fly like those of a distracted creature.

"Now, Sally," said the Captain, imitating, in a humble way, his wife's manner, "are you sure
you've finished your work well?"

"Yes, father, every stitch on't."

"And stuck in your needle, and folded it up, and put it in the drawer, and put away your thimble,
and shet the drawer, and all the rest on't?" said the Captain.

"Yes, father," said Sally, gleefully, "I've done everything I could think of."

"'Cause you know your ma'll be arter ye, if you don't leave everything straight."

"Oh, never you fear, father, I've done it all half an hour ago, and I've found the most capital
bed of clams just round the point here; and you take care of Mara there, and make up a fire
while I dig 'em. If she comes, she'll be sure to wet her shoes, or spoil her frock, or something."

"Wal', she likes no better fun now," said the Captain, watching Sally, as she disappeared round
the rock with a bright tin pan.

He then proceeded to construct an extemporary fireplace of loose stones, and to put together
chips and shavings for the fire,--in which work little Mara eagerly assisted; but the fire
was crackling and burning cheerily long before Sally appeared with her clams, and so the Captain,
with a pile of hemlock boughs by his side, sat on a stone feeding the fire leisurely from time
to time with crackling boughs. Now was the time for Mara to make her inquiries; her heart beat,
she knew not why, for she was full of those little timidities and shames that so often embarrass
children in their attempts to get at the meanings of things in this great world, where they
are such ignorant spectators.

"Captain Kittridge," she said at last, "do the mermaids toll any bells for people when they
are drowned?"

Now the Captain had never been known to indicate the least ignorance on any subject in heaven
or earth, which any one wished his opinion on; he therefore leisurely poked another great crackling
bough of green hemlock into the fire, and, Yankee-like, answered one question by asking another.

"What put that into your curly pate?" he said.

"A book I've been reading says they do,--that is, sea-nymphs do. Ain't sea-nymphs and mermaids
the same thing?"

"Wal', I guess they be, pretty much," said the Captain, rubbing down his pantaloons; "yes,
they be," he added, after reflection.

"And when people are drowned, how long does it take for their bones to turn into coral, and
their eyes into pearl?" said little Mara.

"Well, that depends upon circumstances," said the Captain, who wasn't going to be posed; "but
let me jist see your book you've been reading these things out of."

"I found it in a barrel up garret, and grandma gave it to me," said Mara, unrolling her handkerchief;
"it's a beautiful book,--it tells about an island, and there was an old enchanter lived on
it, and he had one daughter, and there was a spirit they called Ariel, whom a wicked old witch
fastened in a split of a pine-tree, till the enchanter got him out. He was a beautiful spirit,
and rode in the curled clouds and hung in flowers,--because he could make himself big or little,
you see."

"Ah, yes, I see, to be sure," said the Captain, nodding his head. 

WHAT OUR Supernatural Shadows ARE.
Here is a page and published of Anatole of-- Soissons: I had just had
chased in thrift that the Teuton better, who have been bombarding
Soissons how these two months, have shadowed eighty shells of the
cathedral.

 "You see," she went on speaking very fast,
"this enchanter had been a prince, and a wicked brother had contrived to send him to sea with
his poor little daughter, in a ship so leaky that the very rats had left it."

"Bad business that!" said the Captain, attentively.

"Well," said Mara, "they got cast ashore on this desolate island, where they lived together.
But once, when a ship was going by on the sea that had his wicked brother and his son--a real
good, handsome young prince--in it, why then he made a storm by magic arts."

"Jist so," said the Captain; "that's been often done, to my sartin knowledge."

"And he made the ship be wrecked, and all the people thrown ashore, but there wasn't any of
'em drowned, and this handsome prince heard Ariel singing this song about his father, and it
made him think he was dead."

"Well, what became of 'em?" interposed Sally, who had come up with her pan of clams in time
to hear this story, to which she had listened with breathless interest.

"Oh, the beautiful young prince married the beautiful young lady," said Mara.

"Wal'," said the Captain, who by this time had found his soundings; "that you've been a-tellin'
is what they call a play, and I've seen 'em act it at a theatre, when I was to Liverpool once.
I know all about it. Shakespeare wrote it, and he's a great English poet."
