With our chosen friends, on the other hand, and still more between lovers (for mutual understanding
is love's essence), the truth is easily indicated by the one and aptly comprehended by the
other. A hint taken, a look understood, conveys the gist of long and delicate explanations;
and where the life is known even YEA and NAY become luminous. In the closest of all relations--that
of a love well founded and equally shared-speech is half discarded, like a roundabout, infantile
process or a ceremony of formal etiquette; and the two communicate directly by their presences,
and with few looks and fewer words contrive to share their good and evil and uphold each other's
hearts in joy. And to live out of doors with the woman a man loves is of all lives the most
complete and free.

*****

The flower of the hedgerow and the star of heaven satisfy and delight us: how much more the
look of the exquisite being who was created to bear and rear, to madden and rejoice mankind!

*****

So strangely are we built: so much more strong is the love of woman than the mere love of life.

*****

You think that pity--and the kindred sentiments-have the greatest power upon the heart. I think
more nobly of women. To my view, the man they love will first of all command their respect;
he will be steadfast-proud, if you please; dry-possibly-but of all things steadfast. They will
look at him in doubt; at last they will see that stern face which he presents to all of the
rest of the world soften to them alone. First, trust, I say. It is so that a woman loves who
is worthy of heroes.

The sex likes to pick up knowledge and yet preserve its superiority. It is good policy, and
almost necessary in the circumstances. If a man finds a woman admires him, were it only for
his acquaintance with geography, he will begin at once to build upon the admiration. It is
only by unintermittent snubbing that the pretty ones can keep us in our place. Men, as Miss
Howe or Miss Harlowe would have said, 'are such encroachers.' For my part, I am body and soul
with the women; and after a well-married couple, there is nothing so beautiful in the world
as the myth of the divine huntress. It is no use for a man to take to the woods; we know him;
Anthony tried the same thing long ago, and had a pitiful time of it by all accounts. But there
is this about some women, which overtops the best gymnosophist among men, that they suffice
themselves, and can walk in a high and cold zone without the countenance of any trousered being.
I declare, although the reverse of a professed ascetic, I am more obliged to women for this
ideal than I should be to the majority of them, or indeed to any but one, for a spontaneous
kiss. There is nothing so encouraging as the spectacle of self-sufficiency. And when I think
of the slim and lovely maidens, running the woods all night to the note of Diana's horn; moving
among the old oaks, as fancy-free as they; things of the forest and the starlight, not touched
by the commotion of man's hot and turbid life-although there are plenty other ideals that I
should prefer--I find my heart beat at the thought of this one. 'Tis to fail in life, but to
fail with what a grace! That is not lost which is not regretted. And where--here slips out
the male--where would be much of the glory of inspiring love, if there were no contempt to
overcome?

And lastly, he was dark and she fair, and he was male and she female, the everlasting fountain

Never ask women folk. They're bound to answer 'No.' God never made the lass that could resist
the temptation.

*****

It is an odd thing how happily two people, if there are two, can live in a place where they
have no acquaintance. I think the spectacle of a whole life in which you have no part paralyses
personal desire. You are content to become a mere spectator. The baker stands in his door;
the colonel with his three medals goes by to the CAFE at night; the troops drum and trumpet
and man the ramparts as bold as so many lions. It would task language to say how placidly you
behold all this. In a place where you have taken some root you are provoked out of your indifference;
you have a hand in the game--your friends are fighting with the army. But in a strange town,
not small enough to grow too soon familiar, nor so large as to have laid itself out for travellers,
you stand so far apart from the business that you positively forget it would be possible to
go nearer; you have so little human interest around you that you do not remember yourself to
be a man.

Pity was her weapon and her weakness. To accept the loved one's faults, although it has an
air of freedom, is to kiss the chain.

Marriage is a step so grave and decisive that it attracts light-headed, variable men by its
very awfulness. They have been so tried among the inconstant squalls and currents, so often
sailed for islands in the air or lain becalmed with burning heart, that they will risk all
for solid ground below their feet. Desperate pilots, they run their sea-sick, weary bark upon
the dashing rocks. It seems as if marriage were the royal road through life, and realised,
on the instant, what we have all dreamed on summer Sundays when the bells ring, or at night
when we cannot sleep for the desire of living. They think it will sober and change them. Like
those who join a brotherhood, they fancy it needs but an act to be out of the coil and clamour
for ever. But this is a wile of the devil's. To the end, spring winds will sow disquietude,
passing faces leave a regret behind them, and the whole world keep calling and calling in their
ears. For marriage is like life in this-that it is a field of battle, and not a bed of roses.

*****

For there is something in marriage so natural and inviting, that the step has an air of great
simplicity and ease; it offers to bury for ever many aching preoccupations; it is to afford
us unfailing and familiar company through life; it opens up a smiling prospect of the blest
and passive kind of love, rather than the blessing and active; it is approached not only through
the delights of courtship, but by a public performance and repeated legal signatures. A man
naturally thinks it will go hard within such august circumvallations. And yet there is probably
no other act in a man's life so hot-headed and foolhardy as this one of marriage.

*****

Again, when you have married your wife, you would think you were got upon a hilltop, and might
begin to go downward by an easy slope. But you have only ended courting to begin marriage.
Falling in love and winning love are often difficult tasks to overbearing and rebellious spirits;
but to keep in love is also a business of some importance, to which both man and wife must
bring kindness and goodwill. The true love story commences at the altar, when there lies before
the married pair a most beautiful contest of wisdom and generosity, and a life-long struggle
towards an unattainable ideal. Unattainable? Ay, surely unattainable, from the very fact that
they are two instead of one.

*****

When the generation is gone, when the play is over, when the thirty years' panorama has been
withdrawn in tatters from the stage of the world, we may ask what has become of these great,
weighty, and undying loves and the sweethearts who despised mortal conditions in a fine credulity;
and they can only show us a few songs in a bygone taste, a few actions worth remembering, and
a few children who have retained some happy stamp from the disposition of their parents.

Hope looks for unqualified success; but Faith counts certainly on failure, and takes honourable
defeat to be a form of victory. In the first, he expects an angel for a wife; in the last,
he knows that she is like himself--erring, thoughtless, and untrue; but like himself also,
filled with a struggling radiancy of better things, and adorned with ineffective qualities.
You may safely go to school with hope; but, ere you marry, should have learned the mingled
lesson of the world: that dolls are stuffed with sawdust, and yet are excellent playthings;
that hope and love address themselves to a perfection never realised, and yet, firmly held,
become the salt and staff of life; that you yourself are compacted of infirmities, perfect,
you might say, in imperfections, and yet you have a something in you lovable and worth preserving;
and that, while the mass of mankind lies under this scurvy condemnation, you will scarce find
one but, by some generous reading, will become to you a lesson, a model, and a noble spouse

Marriage is of so much use to women, opens out to her so much more of life, and puts her in
the way of so much more freedom and usefulness, that, whether she marry ill or well, she can
hardly miss some benefit. It is true, however, that some of the merriest and most genuine of
women are old maids; and that those old maids, and wives who are unhappily married, have often
most of the true motherly touch.

*****

The fact is, we are much more afraid of life than our ancestors, and cannot find it in our
hearts either to marry or not to marry. Marriage is terrifying, but so is a cold and forlorn
old age. People who share a cell in the Bastile, or are thrown together on an uninhabited isle,
if they do not immediately fall to fisticuffs, will find some possible ground of compromise.
They will learn each other's ways and humours, so as to know where they must go warily, and
where they may lean their whole weight. Away is no conviction-- for ours-- whole novel of the Pamphlet,

But the gymnast is not my favourite; he has little or no tincture of the artist in his composition;
his soul is small and pedestrian, for the most part, since his profession makes no call upon
it, and does not accustom him to high ideas. But if a man is only so much of an actor that
he can stumble through a farce, he is made free of a new order of thoughts. He has something
else to think about beside the money-box. He has a pride of his own, and, what is of far more
importance, he has an aim before him that he can never quite attain. He has gone upon a pilgrimage
that will last him his life long, because there is no end to it short of perfection. He will
better himself a little day by day; or, even if he has given up the attempt, he will always
remember that once upon a time he had conceived this high ideal, that once upon a time he fell
in love with a star. Judy had merely finish talk when they were kept by art to Who, who had returned
