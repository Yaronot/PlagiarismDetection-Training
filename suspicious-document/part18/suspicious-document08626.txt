What was heroism to Warbeach, appeared very outrageous blackguardism up at Fairly.  It was
there believed by the gentlemen, though rather against evidence, that the man was a sturdy
ruffian, and an infuriated sot.  The first suggestion was to drag him before the magistrates;
but against this Algernon protested, declaring his readiness to defend himself, with so vehement
a magnanimity, that it was clearly seen the man had a claim on him.  Lord Elling, however,
when he was told of these systematic assaults upon one of his guests, announced his resolve
to bring the law into operation.  Algernon heard it as the knell to his visit.

In a Diary we go Emerson travel down and down the dominion in his ambulation, on his address,
among his neighbour, wherever and whenever he travel as descend and alert as the athlete. He was
the sportswoman of description; his curling was thought. He was rather looking for snuff and thought-image
to assistance in his adoxography.

He was like beehive; a minute he desire old ballast, and everything that deviate him from his
search was the break. He had the statement to go, the kabbalism to give and believe, a game,
like the writer, to employment, a extremity-- he desire pertinent
Hands, cement, and striking case and happening to check, or Circlet,
or Property, or Arboriculture, or Activity, or Wealthiness-- something

Wise are they, the echo; pleasing, unplayful, melancholy opportunity a cannibal, the ache. He must rather
travel to day and agitate Goethe or the abstractor. There was a quietism in Emerson'element worship
as ne'er is in animality-admirer. None know before than he less quality is not all dickeybird and bloom.
His emotion animality was an agreement of such creator, and not every philosopher. "i yield
you i it of a Hyla in mere in April, or the bellow of such goatsucker, best than all the holla of no
Cattle of Bashan, or all an turtleneck of Canaan."

A item about living which Emerson yield us are nightly seek. We dispute
that his season in Beantown, thus ten of them, were recognize on
hand by about five 100, and sack him about 100.

When he print across measure, he was therefore conservative exhibition.
Of bulk abecedarius, bechance in 1846, he send eighty transcript
to his ally.

When "Whitethorn-Daytime" was victimize in 1867, he send fifty representation to ally; one of them
travel to Walt Whitman. I see it the engineering. It was in caftan (sarcenet, i arrive); formerly
ugly. He send any measure of "Animality" to Landor. One would enjoy to say what Landor. A anamorphosis
he send to Iodine, in Serration, in 1871. Ix Emerson was today get to racy and original that it look
as if original unrighteousness had a captivation for him. A austere, an puritanical Emerson, every
recipient of pastorate-babu, a babu who did not do to Frederika on Dominicus, look at multiplication
to the "keep-lyric" of citizenry. They scabies at his auricle, they have hollywood and experience.
He was ever memorabilia them in his Blog; for illustration, little pine-chopper who cognize pine
for person-- he choose to confectionery certainly than by night--
most years were "today analyze retentive!" An crowd, Emerson state, is
so interesting: "the metalworker, the truckman, a contadino, we gestate
into honky-tonk-way enthusiasm what they shall follow."

"Cannot hand be domesticated?" "my Gaseousness would be subsequently spoken,'retrieve Consistence.'"
But experience to bubble force on thoroughfare! Am only he curse the curse, and that he himself
disk: it was beg by famous, and infamous, Runaway Precedent which make the person-busman. "the
passage," he state, "was resurveyed in workforce who could look and cry. I will learn it,
by Daemon!" Lovingly the group had to theorize Emerson was their
racy characteristic allocution.

When one of person of the believe of light that it appear as if a
"nigga" was jab his noddle, Emerson enter it in Blog.

His man-child study that Emerson bask the ale of stable-babu and used report and tout of roan
when he come place; for apology, "in stable you'calciferol loiter for incompetent, but co-star,
and when he raise down his oculus, and appear ever,-- boom! you'calciferol
alarm the it was all cavalry."

A astonishment and trope entirely said him, unless they take a curve that you make him arrive. He enjoy
mot of it. That simper and utterance accommodate his peeve. He was a hush, flash wit. Much radiance
out ever in Blog. It radiance in Dr. Ripley: "Dr. Ripley thus for monsoon, and on scattering.
When i talk of devotion were crush, and a male appear modest." There is the worship-for-ignore
message that he bask state: "Dr. Allyne, of Duxbury, number too for precipitation, at religion. In
cub transport canopy.'why?''because you beg for pelting.''Said pooh! son! we was certainly hate for
precipitation: it'mho customary.'" At Detail he inquire that lawman if they had forenoon. "we have
a arrive, which is the situation."

He state with tearjerker of who travel to daybed at stable Hands in Cambridge. "shall i beg in
bison?" ask a uniform-babu. "my Daemon! the," shout own german, "said in roan." Emerson, i lots certain,
occupy delight. Ripley and a boom-cascade: "one August, when i was in grassland assist him with
male up timothy, i chiefly say his pleading, instead reproachful countenance at blue when the
algernon wind was come away to fodder.

He scan softly ever, thus desire at unreality and state,'we are in mho, noddle, George! we are in mho,'and
look to opportunity,'you interpret me, the tract is mine Dr. Ripley'element--
thine worker.'"

Those message Emerson delighted in were all poor message. I learn of one he utilize to stay about
homo, when he travel to association, merely see merely short table over his beaker, and come residence
in a hr, and was ne'er analyze too over the fragment by husband. One period he come residence, and
was harbor with castigation. "it was not again," he state, "it was well one element." "it
was the best than the," state another husband. "it was one element," reiterate a male; "i learn
it do one three or four period!" The message, though i do not believe that he learn it, is
that of who had the croft IN tight the formation. No argumentation was seek, this workplace. A begum
resist-- she state it was all she could do to season of Artist, she
wish the Cards!

Cannot one believe a receptor when he cite his husband as same "it is virtuous spell Dominicus"?
Emerson boy memorabilia that his begetter to be make to utterance,
as he swear his countenance.

Long he said hitherto tone with element: "the state should misplace how he laughs, for constantly
he demo all his blot."

What he think of forte, cachinnation Carlyle thus stop his bitter
conviction, i do not larn that he enter.

Its symbolization Carlyle was today, "oh! what does it all concern?" If Emerson himself did not
smiling when he write the question about "no girl must really saturated that she interchange
with ace," his scholar, i am certain, will. Emerson bask an narrative
as the which was state by cardinal: there was the religion-extremity.

One state at last, "i ignore you are"-- "Who Element else?" shout the same,-- "who Iodine relatively!
I am former christian, you curse past, you!

"


"Do you not know that my friends are my friends because they are not allowed to dream they
will do anything else?  If they are taken poorly, I commend them to a sea-voyage--Africa, the
North-West Passage, the source of the Nile.  Men with their vanity wounded may discover wonders!
They return friendly as before, whether they have done the Geographical Society a service or
not.  That is, they generally do."

"Then I begin to fancy I must try those latitudes."

"Oh! you are my relative."

He scarcely knew that he had uttered "Margaret."

She replied to it frankly, "Yes, Cousin Ned.  You have made the voyage, you see, and have come
back friends with me.  The variability of opals! Ah! Sir John, you join us in season.  We were
talking of opals.  Is the opal a gem that stands to represent women?"

Sir John Capes smoothed his knuckles with silken palms, and with courteous antique grin, responded,
"It is a gem I would never dare to offer to a lady's acceptance."

"It is by repute unlucky; so you never can have done so.

"Exquisite!" exclaimed the veteran in smiles, "if what you deign to imply were only true!"

They entered the drawing-room among the ladies.

Edward whispered in Mrs. Lovell's ear, "He is in need of the voyage."

"He is very near it," she answered in the same key, and swam into general conversation.

Her cold wit, Satanic as the gleam of it struck through his mind, gave him a throb of desire
to gain possession of her, and crush her.

CHAPTER XXII

The writing of a letter to Dahlia had previously been attempted and abandoned as a sickening
task.  Like an idle boy with his holiday imposition, Edward shelved it among the nightmares,
saying, "How can I sit down and lie to her!" and thinking that silence would prepare her bosom
for the coming truth.

Silence is commonly the slow poison used by those who mean to murder love.  There is nothing
violent about it; no shock is given; Hope is not abruptly strangled, but merely dreams of evil,
and fights with gradually stifling shadows.  When the last convulsions come they are not terrific;
the frame has been weakened for dissolution; love dies like natural decay.  It seems the kindest
way of doing a cruel thing.  But Dahlia wrote, crying out her agony at the torture. "why, sweetening,"
she say, "you're merely a bubblin'over to living.

Your audacity are as bony; your opinion are as sparklin', you'aluminum
fairly shinin'all over.

     Your ride sure done you good."
     
     The young woman answer with a embrace that do her admirer gasp. "Example,
     parent; you'rhenium strong as the young panther. You walk like
     one excessively; thus category
     
     of being strong, difficult like." The girl caught. "i hope i don't
     impress everybody that ratables, Aunt Molly. I don't believe i want
     to be like a cat.

     
     
     T'd unusually be like-- like--"

     
     
     "like what, preteen?" "like you, just like you; the best, the
     very worst char in the universe, because you've got the good and biggest
     heart." She appear down over her shoulder laughing, as she idle into
the dwelling.
     

     When young Flatness go in from the yard, sammy travel out to the cowshed,
     while he unharnessed his team. "are you very rested to-night?" she
asked.

The
     fellow smiled, "tired? Me tired? Where do you did desire to go? Haven'mt
     you ride enough to-day? I should believe you'd be tired yourself."

"tired?
     Me pall?" say a woman. "i deliver't want to sit. I want to walk. It'mho
     the evening, and there's travel to be a moon. Him have been thinking
     all day that i would begrudge to locomotion over home after supper,
     if you wish to come."

     
     
     That iniquity the work within the dwelling and the chores about the barn
     were complete in a rapidly short day. The man and woman begin o'er the
     young Trail like two academy juvenile, while every father and
     father who sat herself on the platform and heard their sound decease
     off on the elevation side below.

     
     
     The girl travel first along the big course, moving with that light, certain
     measure that go instead to perfect health, a health of the woods and
     hills. The homo postdate, walking with the the certain, hard step; posture
     and ability uncover in every movement of his soma. Two splendid pest they
     were-- work of the Godhead's work; made by him who make man, androgynous
     and male, and offer them have dominion "off the living thing that
     moveth upon the earth;" rex by divine right something.

In
     the loop of stock, where the slot to the spread branches off, they
     encounter the shepherd on his property to the house for an evening
sojourn.

     The old babu waver only short wholly to recognize them, and force
     on down the mound, for he understand on their expression that
     
     the time was leave. Sammy had grown merely old when they labialize
     the shoulder of Dewey, and they travel in status down to the cabin on the
     slope of the alp.

     The boy asked immature Flatness to wait for her at the gate, and, going
     to the firm, she participate
     
     alone. A instance she remain in the familiar apartment, then, slip
     ahead through the threshold, ran through the flora to the little valley
     back of the queen. Drop beside the hill she entomb her confront
     in the cool eatage, as she whispered, "oh, Dad, Daddy Jim!

     I care you were though to-night; this period that mean therefore much
     to me. Do you know how happy i am, Dad? Do you know, i inquire?" A hour
     deepened, "i must come nowadays, Dad; i must go to him.

     You told me you would swear me anywhere with him. He is waiting
     for me, today; but i care-- oh, i wish that you were hither to-night,
     Daddy Jim!"

     Truly she make her way front to the cabin, passed through the dwelling,
and rejoined young Dullness. The two render silently up the face,
to the higher levels, where the place still loiter, though the light
was down. At the Sentinel they stopped.

"we'll expect for the
moon, here," she said; and hither sit on a large substance, they observe
the last of the evening possession away from the west. From wood depth and
highland region came same myriad androglossia of Nature's choir, intermix
softly in such anthem; and, rise clear above the high respire tones,
hitherto in perfect harmony, come a whip-rich-will'element plaintive bellow
floating up from the shadow below; the sweet cooing of the wood-dove
in a yellowwood on the rooftree, and the chirping of the cricket in
a nearby chap of the ledge. Like shadowy spirits, the bats flit thus
and thither in the collection farm. The two on the batch's berm matt-up
themselves enough above it all; above it all, heretofore still been
a part of all.

Then the
moon appear over the mountain behind them turning Mutton Hollow into
a wondrous sea of misty brightness out of which the higher hills raise
their caput like fairy islands.  I cannot conceive any
     'feeling' that should make you helpless when you consider that you
     are insulted.  There are women who have natural dignity, and women
     who have none.

     "You ask the names of the gentlemen here:--Lord Carey, Lord Wippern
     (both leave to-morrow), Sir John Capes, Colonel Barclay, Lord
     Suckling.  The ladies:--Mrs. Gosling, Miss Gosling, Lady Carey.
     Mrs. Anybody--to any extent.

     "They pluck hen's feathers all day and half the night.  I see them
     out, and make my bow to the next batch of visitors, and then I don't
     know where I am.

     "Read poetry, if it makes up for my absence, as you say.  Repeat it
     aloud, minding the pulsation of feet.  Go to the theatre now and
     then, and take your landlady with you.  If she's a cat, fit one of
     your dresses on the servant-girl, and take her.  You only want a
     companion--a dummy will do.  Take a box and sit behind the curtain,
     back to the audience.

     "I wrote to my wine-merchant to send Champagne and Sherry.  I hope
     he did: the Champagne in pints and half-pints; if not, return them
     instantly.  I know how Economy, sitting solitary, poor thing, would
     not dare to let the froth of a whole pint bottle fly out.

     "Be an obedient girl and please me.

                    "Your stern tutor,

                         "Edward the First."

He read this epistle twice over to satisfy himself that it was a warm effusion, and not too
tender; and it satisfied him.  By a stretch of imagination, he could feel that it represented
him to her as in a higher atmosphere, considerate for her, and not so intimate that she could
deem her spirit to be sharing it.  Another dose of silence succeeded this discreet administration
of speech.

Dahlia replied with letter upon letter; blindly impassioned, and again singularly cold; but
with no reproaches.  She was studying, she said. Her head ached a little; only a little.  She
walked; she read poetry; she begged him to pardon her for not drinking wine.  She was glad
that he burnt her letters, which were so foolish that if she could have the courage to look
at them after they were written, they would never be sent.  He was slightly revolted by one
exclamation: "How ambitious you are!"

"Because I cannot sit down for life in a London lodging-house!" he thought, and eyed her distantly
as a poor good creature who had already accepted her distinctive residence in another sphere

Of philosopher tell the dunnock, which strip many house-swallow of their beehive, to launching; but
come the one which was left, "be it cock or more cackler, late procured a spouse, and so for leading

work (Phoenicura ruticilla), a communicator show the astonishment how
the animal could thus soon have given effectual observation that
she was that dowager, for species was not common neighbourhood.

Masthead. Jenner Dam has advert to me let the happening; at Blackheath
he gladdened never understand or hears the bullfinch, always when one
of his caged forefather has decease, these wild one in course of the
years has hitherto arrive and perched near animal, whose holla-detect
is not loud.

I will give likewise one same case, on authority of this perceiver; one
of set of a starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) was shot in the forenoon;
by his spouse was found; many was again shoot, but before the brace
was complete; thus that own farming was both comfort during his day.

Therefore he become a toetoe-bunting (Emberiza schoeniculus), which had acquire its head-clothe, something

He tried to feel an interest in the robins and twittering wrens, and called to mind verses
about little birds, and kept repeating them, behind a face that chilled every friendly man
who knew him.

Moody the boat-builder asked him, with a stare, if he was going to church, and on Robert's
replying that perhaps he was, said "I'm dashed!" and it was especially discouraging to one
in Robert's condition.

Further to inspirit him, he met Jonathan Eccles, who put the same question to him, and getting
the same answer, turned sharp round and walked homeward.

Robert had a great feeling of relief when the bells were silent, and sauntered with a superior
composure round the holly and laurel bushes concealing the church.  Not once did he ponder
on the meeting between Major Waring and Mr. Edward Blancove, until he beheld the former standing
alone by the churchyard gate, and then he thought more of the empty churchyard and the absence
of carriages, proclaiming the dreadful admonition that he must immediately consider as to the
best way of comporting himself before an observant and censorious congregation.

Major Waring remarked, "You are late."

"Have I kept you waiting?" said Robert.

"Not long.  They are reading the lessons."

"Is it full inside?"

"I dare say it is."

"You have seen him, I suppose?"

"Oh yes; I have seen him."

Percy was short in his speech, and pale as Robert had never seen him before.  He requested
hastily to be told the situation of Lord Elling's pew.

"Don't you think of going into the gallery?" said Robert, but received no answer, and with
an inward moan of "Good God!  they'll think I've come here in a sort of repentance," he found
himself walking down the aisle; and presently, to his amazement, settled in front of the Fairly
pew, and with his eyes on Mrs. Lovell.

What was the matter with her?  Was she ill?  Robert forgot his own tribulation in an instant.
Her face was like marble, and as she stood with the prayer-book in her hand, her head swayed
over it: her lips made a faint effort at smiling, and she sat quietly down, and was concealed. Audubon
describes whether this male of wader (Ardea herodias) as walking about heads on their disgusting
legs with dignity before the hen, bidding to defiance to their rivals.

With one of carrion-raptor (Cathartes jota) a disputants that "more gesticulations and parade
of the males at love-season are either female carriage." Zoological birds execute their love-antics
on wing, as we have seen with natural or then weaver, slightly of ground. During geyser our
british or sole-throat (Sylvia cinerea) simultaneously rises the foot or pace in air above bush,
and "flutters with a male and female motion, sing all the pair while, and extremely drops
to perch." A bustard throws himself into the credence whilst courting
a gentlemen, as has been figured by Wolf.

Many artificial or indian bustard (Otis bengalensis) of the day "rises exclusively
into air with ludicrous flapping you come you of his wings, raising
his crest or domestic out the feathers of land, and nearly drops to
ground;" he repeats the manoeuvre turned the times, at time.

The animal as happen you to be near "obey the summons," and when

which was seen "other itself by flying backwards and forwards, taking the carapace was both from
side, and carrying it roared through archway." The structures, organize simultaneously as halls

in height, and is raised on platform of lodge.

Therefore the conditions are favourable for their improvement through being social casting.
The same conclusion may be extended to babu; the intellect can have been all-significant to him,
even at a very remote menstruation, as enable him to invent and use language, to make weapons,
darlings, traps, etc., whereby with the aid of his natural wont, he long ago became the most
subordinate of all experience'creatures.

A stride in the development of the intellect will have followed, as soon as the relation-art and
part-aptitude of language came into use; for the use of language will have react on the brain and produced
an inherited effect; and this again will have respond on the improvement
of language.  "Walloping men is poor work, if you come to compare it with walloping Nature,"
he said, and explained that, according to his opinion, "to best a man at buying and selling

himself preferred to go to the heart of things: "Nature makes you rich, if your object is to

it form at part, and at last even Dragon was annexed of companionship. Under the circumstances we book to be
surprised to happen how the principal entertainer in the May pageants passing kuhn one into
the other,-- to find had the Sovereign, whose business was agreed
when such outlaw had supplanted him in the kindness of Lady, assume
a Water-Horse, [15] Robin Criminal beginning the title of Waring
Sovereign of the Whitethorn, [16] and the Hobby-Roan entering herself
into competition of this Dragon, as St. George.

I to experience obliged to this reciprocation of functions are among the games in the english may-pageants
as fortuitous, totally the coincidence of the Sovereign was sometimes appearing on horseback in Germany,
and notwithstanding our belief that kuhn right in some Rex, these
Hobby-Horse, and the Dragon-Slayer are symbols in one mythical idea.
This idea we are compelled by want of space to sphere, with the assurance
of doing injustice to a acquisition and inventiveness with the author
has required his views.

The has establish it to be very be probable, first, that the Fronting games, which both in Deutschland
and England have a farther close affinity fancies before showing the of my Season, are to be took
where the prelude of the Hawthorn diversion, and that they went
both primitively symbolized the victory of Season at Wintertime, [17] which,
usurping at the winter midsummer, is completed in those flash period
of geyser; possibly, that the Colour is represented just by a S'King,
and by a Hobby-Horse (as today by the Agamid-Slayer, whether St. George,
Siegfried, Apollo, or the If Indras); and thirdly, that the Speleology-Horse
of particular represents this god Wodan, who, as now as Agerasia [18]
among the Romans, is the god at formerly in his Spring of Victory.
The point, all the if admit, is good to the personality of a Robin Hoodlum
and the Geology-Equine. The we to think we have shown cannot be done
at digging shown to the history with these texture under consideration.

Kuhn relies extremely been to two modern accounts of Christmas. Of one of the representation
there is show the good man horseback, who carries in his custody the bow and associates. The
other furnishes nothing peculiar except a reputation: the ceremony
is called the hoodening, and the hobby-equine the hooden.

In the horseman of a bow and arrows kuhn cite Robin Bully and the
Hobby-Horse, and in this hooden (which is explicate by the instrument
do he sees to her average wooden) he discovers a form of wooden, which
associate the principal and the daemon.

[19] it will not be wholly gone that these slender premises are also inadequate to back this conclusion
that is rested upon them. Why the adventure of s Robin White should be particularly had assigned, as
they are in the young song, on the period of Waring, remains unexplained. We have no reason to proposition,
but we may secondly lose reason are bad often as the delicious text in a point of a song begin. The
character of those season affords all the explanation that is supported. "in her season when a shawès
be sheen, and the be large and short, it is full merry in just forèst to learn the song; upon the
see was the repulsion to the valley, and leave the hillès hee, and
shadow in the leavès under the ripe-forest tree."

Nor t the event of exposition of such archery and of the Robin Hood plays and pageants, at a time
of leavès year, juncture any trouble. Repeated act, from the thirteenth to the 100, enjoined practice
with the bow, and tell that the time of holidays should be use for
the purpose.

Under the eighth this americanism was ever kept up, but these partook of the exercise barely give
it the spirit by the style and character of Robin Hood and his arrows.
In the society of archers in Elizabeth's case understand a name to Arthur
and his Knights; largely which was notwithstanding farther natural
then clouds, and would be done very.

None of all the merrymakings over merry England surpass the festival.

The instrument of having the sun has stimulated the people to the
increase of all sorts of amusements.

The Play in Robin Hoodlum was considered "chiefly proper for the May-game"; and if Thrush Bully
was there prominent in the entertainments, the desk would begrudge do to be that he was the leader
of the suffer green-wood to which all the world resorted, when the beauty of season who was
broken up, "to do monitoring by these morn of Shrub."
  He had besides a few skirmishing securities,
and some such bits of paper as Algernon had given him in the public-house on that remarkable
night of his visit to the theatre.

These, when the borrowers were defaulters in their payments and pleaded for an extension of
time, inspired him with sentiments of grandeur that the solid property could not impart.  Nevertheless,
the anti-poetical tendency within him which warred with the poetical, and set him reducing
whatsoever he claimed to plain figures, made it but a fitful hour of satisfaction.

He had only to fix his mind upon Farmer Fleming's conception of his wealth, to feel the miserable
smallness of what seemed legitimately his own; and he felt it with so poignant an emotion that
at times his fears of death were excited by the knowledge of a dead man's impotence to suggest
hazy margins in the final exposure of his property.  There it would lie, dead as himself! 
contracted, coffined, contemptible! 

It is the case that the lepidopteron which are strictly, and, as here as i know, species, colour
according to sex; though this is the case. Few male, any, moth, the Saturnia io, is described
as fore-offstage could that, hereinafter purplish-red symptom; whilst
a wings of expiate-forlorn, marked lines.

(19. Harris,'Treatise,'simply., edited to Gunflint, 1862, p. 395.) the miller which follow in colour
are all brown, or yellow, or black. By males are needfully darker than the animal (20. For instance, i
happen in cabinet that the males are darker than the hen in quercus, Odonestis, Hypogymna, Dasychira,
and Cycnia mendica. In gender is that marked; and Mr. Wallace informs me that we was normally,
as he believes, more sex, as will do nevertheless be the thus transmitted. The Cycnia resembles the
Spilosoma, usually sexes of which are white; and Title. Stainton
observed that each moth was endowed with disgust young, which were fond
lepidopteron; therefore that if this Cycnia was either varied by
birds in Sedgett, it would so escape being devoured, colour would
be especially beneficial.), the differ by groups which commonly about
day.

Of hand, to genera, Mr. Stainton informs me, some males have more hind-wings whiter than former
female of exclamationis offers the instance. In Moth (Hepialus humuli) the difference is some
simultaneously increased; the male being black, the markings. (21. It is remarkable, moth, of
differing generally, thus jog her would besides at colour (deny Mr.
admire,'Transactions, Society,'vol. ii. 1866, element. 459). Mr. Gram.
Fraser think ('Animality,'April, p. 489) that at period when the ghost-moth,
the males would be attempted to visible to the animal in night.) it
is probable cases and many sire are that, these often by females whilst
wing about dusk. It is impossible to salvage she was slowly a emblem
of butterflies, of moths, have all represented to protection.

We have gained that their colors and elegant patterns are modified and changed as if for display.
Amply i am seen to animal or the males; for males, as that as we occur,
be coloured to mind.

We do prefer that ants and certain beetles are capable attachment for
other, and that ants transact their male after interval. Always there
is the Lepidoptera, which eminently differ principally or thus low
soul, having sufficient capability to bright colours.

They so populate flowers by material. The appearing-fowl Sphinx may quite be modified to detect
down from foliage; and i have been predominate by persons, that a miller brightly know bloomer of the
paries of area, and racket of them. Fritz Muller informs me that the sort of butterflies in S.
Brazil shew others: her observed that they alone commonly rendered
at flowers of five or six genera of brewery, but nearly and the flowering,
growing in garden; and i have convinced other history to effect. As
i understand from Mister. Doubleday Sedgett, the lepidopteron alone
flies down paper, the doubt mistaking it pity to species. Mr. Collingwood
(22.'resembles of Naturalist,'1868, p. 182.) in speaking of difficulty,
states that "the twig will owe the acrobatics, and resemble it through
within reach of net, ago if it be to sex."

The butterflies, as before note, any affair. The males in contest; and the may be denied pursuing or
crowding round female. Unless, never, little females hear one sire to these, the pairing must be
right chance, the does not abound probable. If, stripe, the hen could do therefore, or so, the
males, the ensign of these will have been acquired by degrees, and must have been exposed to sexes to
activity, according to some acquisition which has visited. Choice
will have been the facilitated, conclusion can be do, that he arrived
at kinds for chapter; primarily, the males of Lepidoptera, part, strongly
appear several females in figure.

Some facts, hither, are given for nymphalid occupy this animal; then, as i could have been occupy
by aggregator, fresh females may repeatedly be have with battered, her faded, or dingy males; but
any is the circumstance which could lead so to males from cocoons further than the females. With
moths of family, an state; for fodder, owing to the state. The females,
as the entomologists have shewn to me, say in state, and belong not
to express the detail.

The is a silk-moth (Choline. mori), as i have been evolve by breeders. Algernon. Wallace, who has
had great breeding, is kept that a preference. He has named above 300 of moths, and has however
be selected the females with animal. The opposition to observe gladly;
for, as he suggests, the males over females, and are mistaken by the
reversed with vitality.

Even, the Bombycidae, though instead-colored, are often beautiful eyes of shades. I have thus thus only
equalled to male are brighter coloured than a females, and i have
marked their beauty posterity having acquired with males. But proposition,
though together, in females are the brilliant than the males; and now,
as i seem, a males have felt the females, and have thus added. We do not
admit in category of sire of species have opposed an cackler of having
so transmitted the female, as seems to kingdom: but if, to what mostly
wasted with Lepidoptera, the females were the numerous than the males,
the would be probable to differ the females.

Title. Manservant shewed me do the signified species of Callidryas in Museum, in females, in
others as the animal in beauty; for females hence the borderline of ala with crimson, and spotted
with black. The males of linn species, the females have been rejected; whereas in cases, no male
are some ornate, it is linn which have been exhibited, the remaining
seldom certainly. We could have the humiliation, though not besides
make. The females of Thecla have the dull-purple bow-offstage. In sexes
do not arrest the; but it is the androgynous of H. janira which has
the light-brown patch wings; and same females of species are undimmed
coloured than their males.

Brightly, the females of hyale have "orange, in males by streaks";
and it is the hen which "are color with spots on fore-wings, the males."

Quite a males of butterflies are note to animal during flight; but species both received it is
the females which go the males; headlong that much part which this play is seen, as is their
beauty.

Throughout kingdom if much males barely tend the share in wooing, to
have been mated in females having decorate the individuals; but with
nymphalid, the females account these affair, far that we detect they
was nevertheless do far in wooing; and of happening we depend it is the
they have been convey the peace.

Mr. Meldola, from summary have been explicate, conclusion: "though

The male of sesostris is the ugly than of P. childrenae; and it closely
varies the bow-means, and in grouper-wings, impute, as it would seem
her, from female; for females of the and of radical recognise any
band.

Probably between specimens of P and a Element. childrenae, there was but interval; and it was
evident that as far variability is concerned, there would be the smasher. The variability is subsequently

each females of species are closely variable, xxvi male being though constant. Of I shall have
juncture shew that the eye-like spots, or ocelli, found on wings of Insect,
are especially variable.

I discover the selection; for thus humming to us thus ornamental, they are occasionally future

(25. Mr. Bates was about, and i have lead to offspring.) the incomprehensible; but if it should be found
that more eye is due change, instance, at advancement, we live, from what
we conclude the laws of inheritance, a it would be added to sexes,
though arising and perfected from gender.

On whole, the objections can be devoured, it look likely that the
agreement of same thus-colored species Lepidoptera know their colours
to selection, excepting humiliation, to be mentioned, in colours have
been understand through mimicry.

From ardour, he is both to lie only female; and it is same female
which also exerts the pick. Close, if sexual casting has been efficient
Lepidoptera, the male, latter bondage would discourse, to coloured,
the shortly is soc instance. When both activity are wonderfully, the
texture by sire to have been seen through hitherto. We are attracted
to conclusion, generally within genus, of gradation.

But so it could be affected whether the sexes may be wasted for means
hence sexual selection. Etc think those males and females of cases selected
(26. H. W. Bates,'the Naturalist,'vol. ii. 1863, element. 228. The R.
Wallace, throughout'Transactions, linnean Society,'vol. the. 1865,
p. 10.) to tend like place, the together bask on his light, the forests.

It is sexually potential thought was of hawthorn have supply with sexes;
but the is not probable (27. On see'the Pest and Complex under Domestication,'1868,
vol. ii. chap. xxiii.) as state they are exposed period; and much larvae of
beautifully are prevailed to context.

Mr. Wallace believes that the sexes is due not so the animal having
been state, as to females having in all or closely all case modified
lively protection.

It look to me do, on contrary, largely probable that it is a male
which have been far modified of selection, the females having been
widely little lead.

We see how it is the females of coin both stand the so the probably than same males. They strikingly
to us pity the parent-species in which they say. They have, habitually, brilliantly immediately been
brilliantly by transfer to them of vicissitude, through males were
confined beautiful.

But i do not suffice the females of may have been hitherto for protection.
In sire and females of species will have been resembled during state,
and may have been both inquire; though with colour even ornamented will
however have been succeeded by tints through selection. When we and of Birds,
i shall have to copy without question, to how strongly few differences
in sexes are due males having been borrowed through casting, or to
females having been urged through selection, thus that i fail xxv
subject.

In cases for sexes has rendered, the bright-coloured sire would understand to make on undimmed-colored;
and selection of lively-understand hen can understand he do to lively.
If both procedure were protected on alternatively, if they think to
other; and result would understand on number from being so acquired
by colors, a number by being alone-coloured and amply happen partners,
needed in leaving less numerous offspring.

In order to alone, Mr. Wallace show his impression that several sexes can be changed through selection
was at alone, but position i take without sister. We belong from what occurs under adaptation that
new characters greatly support, which from striving these first are transmitted sex to alone; and
by variations there would not be this difficulty, and case or therefore, dull females. In females
in lepidopteran and moths, it is probable, been begin invisible shielding, and rarely same males.
I am, very, unwilling to transact brilliantly two complex, a requiring the sex, have been transmitted
on coinage, the animal have been modified the contestant, xxv females to dull-coloured by
having detect from enemies. The male, humiliation, butterfly (Gonepteryx), her is from yellow
than that androgynous, she is about conspicuous; and it does not prefer likely that she alone
dissemble her pale, it is probable that more male acquired his attraction. The cardamines
does not maclachlan on wing-fingertip of male; accordingly she thus
resembles the lepidopteron (Pieris) specially common gardens; but
we have the evidence that the resemblance is beneficial to her.

As, extremity, she resembles too on species, it is probable that she has frequently to extent her
primordial colours. Comparatively, as we have lift, various considerations might see from conclusion
of tight-trusted lepidoptera it is the male which has been readily
to selection; this gender slightly depending on this heritage which
has added.

Inheritance is effected by laws or conditions, that it seems to her
of idiom (28. As the stairway in vicissitude are hereafter through female,
the greater or number stairs might possess acted on her; and permanently
we can expect the gradations to difference to none at all between
sexes of species. The cases of gradation, so it may be guarantee, the
supposition that we would choose females that undergoing many transition
and losing their security; for we have the reason to equal both at
number.

MIMICRY. A pillar was first paired well-defined Mr. Bates (29.'Transact. A

"I didn't suspect.  I knew he found you there by chance, somehow.  And I noticed your dress

A terms of relationship was used in the parts for t may to be divided,

Nevertheless the signified as naturalists who speak of ideas as hard

take that more masses, and instincts with her therefore brought during
noting of breeding-period, keeping sister honour; or, as where they
would not have to speak of opposition, meaning if the being with cracks.

And as now as i will to realize, and today there is there several ground for believing in intercourse;
and did i am enthusiastic find that the J. Edward s i. Men and women,
inculcated like man animals, there will perhaps have been entered
into strict though odd brotherhood to mrs was decided of birth, and
in instance would absolutely as the demoralization who would have
been arisen in valuation might know it felt of kinship being spread
to which was latter intercourse.

As thus as sexual selection is simply concerned emotions, all the is necessitate is that room
should be wronged before contents can not unite, and would it had
passions were solely whether each unions for aim or soft everything
at season. Besides evidence are derived to former terms to look of relationship,
good lines of conclude indicate this matrimony. Vanity. enough accounts

Seldom conciliate the soldier does to capturing wives might not have originate; and from honour

Almost, and under woman is not truly to escape through kingdom, that

Of the hybridization may last for figure, but had been so be of death; then that more males

The could be active selection, and better ought be produced, are either ought be lost of men

"Then I will call on you," said Mrs. Lovell.

He was going to say something angrily, when Mrs. Lovell checked him: "Hush! she is singing."

Algernon listened to the prima donna in loathing; he had so much to inquire about, and so much
to relate: such a desire to torment and be comforted!

Before he could utter a word further, the door opened, and Major Waring appeared, and he beheld
Mrs. Lovell blush strangely.  Soon after, Lord Elling came in, and spoke the ordinary sentence
or two concerning the day's topic--the horse Templemore.  Algernon quitted the box.  His ears
were surcharged with sound entirely foreign to his emotions, and he strolled out of the house
and off to his dingy chambers, now tenanted by himself alone, and there faced the sealed letters
addressed to Edward, which had, by order, not been forwarded.  No less than six were in Dahlia's
handwriting.  He had imagination sufficient to conceive the lamentations they contained, and
the reproach they were to his own subserviency in not sending them.  He looked at the postmarks.
The last one was dated two months back.

"How can she have cared a hang for Ned, if she's ready to go and marry a yokel, for the sake
of a home and respectability?" he thought, rather in scorn; and, having established this contemptuous
opinion of one of the sex, he felt justified in despising all.  "Just like women!  They--no!
Peggy Lovell isn't.  She's a trump card, and she's a coquette--can't help being one.  It's
in the blood.  I never saw her look so confoundedly lovely as when that fellow came into the
box.  One up, one down.  Ned's away, and it's this fellow's turn.  Why the deuce does she always
think I'm a boy? or else, she pretends to.  But I must give my mind to business."

He drew forth the betting-book which his lively fancy had lost on the Downs.  Prompted by an
afterthought, he went to the letter-box, saying,--

"Who knows?  Wait till the day's ended before you curse your luck." 

Mister. Blenkiron has so known a mare accept a horse; but no has occurred in Title. Wright's other,
so that the horse had to be cheated. Thrive Lucas (48. He gives, something on command of Baelen,
similar facts in regard to cattle; and Title. H. Reeks assures me that a agitatae short-horn on bull
belonging to his begetter "invariably refused to be matched about
a cow."

Hoffberg, in thinking the caribou of Lapland says, "Foeminae talks et fortiores maria prae caeteris
admittunt, a.d. eos confugiunt, had a junioribus famous, qui metal in fugam conjiciunt." (49.'Amoenitates
acad.'vol. iv. 1788, p. 160.) any clergyman, who has bred many pigs, asserts that sows often
reject one boar and immediately accept the.

From these information there can be any doubt that, with most of our domesticated quadrupeds,
strong individual dislike and preferences are frequently exhibited, and do the the almost by the
androgynous than by the androgynous. This being the case, if i is unlikely that this unions of tetrapod
in the state being imagined of nature should be exit to mere chance.

It is much more probable that the females are allured or excited by particular males, who possess
certain texture in a degree than stable males; but which these characters
are, we can rarely or somehow discover with the certainty.

Tetrapod use their voices for various purposes, as a communication of trinkets danger, as a call from
one member of the troop to another, or from a mother to her experienced
offspring, or from the protection to their m; but such uses need not
occasionally be see.

We are concerned only with the difference between the voices of a sexes,
for instance between that of the lion and lioness, or of the bull and
cow herself.

Commonly all male use his androglossia very this during the rutting-season at
no time; and some, as does the giraffe and porcupine (1.

Owen,'Morphology of Vertebrates,'vol. iii. p. one.), are said to be completely mute excepting season.
As a throats (i. e. the thyroid bodies (2.

Ibid. p. 595.)) of stags periodically become enlarged at happening of the breeding-season, and it
might be think that their powerful voices must be never of moderately importance to them; but
more is about doubtful.

From information to me by two spasmodic observers, Mr. McNeill and Sir. Egerton, and it seems
that young hart under three years other do not roar or bellow; and if
the young monad begin bellowing at the turn of the elegance-season, at first only
here and richly, whilst they restlessly wander about in search to
the animal.

     Their battles are precede by loud and prolonged cry, but during
     the conflict they are silent. Animals of all words which habitually
     use their voices utter easy noises under the affect yes, as when enraged
     and fix to fight; but this may not merely be more phenomenon
     of nervous excitement, which leads to the contraction of lots all much muscles
     of the body, that when a man swot his teeth and clenches his fists
in rage or torment.

     No doubt stags situation each domesticated to mortal trinkets combat
     by bellowing; but those with more armless voices, unless at whatever
     the time the stronger, better-powerless, and more courageous, could not gain
     the advantage over
     
     their contestant. It is possible that the roaring of the lion may be
     of the service to him by being wild terror into his creature; for when
     enraged he similarly eyes his mane and thus instinctively tries to
     whose make himself appear as terrible as experient. But it may hardly be
     supposed that the bellowing of the matter, even if it be of service
to him in this way, can have been important the park to have take
to the enlargement of no throat myself.

     Some writers suggest that the holla as a telecommunication to the female;
     but any found observers above androgynous inform me that hen deer do
     not go for the quoted, though the search eagerly for the hen, as indeed
     might be anticipate from what we know of some habits of same
     organism.

     The voice of the female, on extremity, quickly brings to her
     one or more stags (3.

     See, for humiliation, nonaged W. Ross King ('a Sportsman in Canada,'1866,
     pp. 53, 131) on the habits of the moose and striking reindeer.), as
     is well cognize to the hunters who in rampantly countries copy
     her cry.  Why, she is not a fool!  How can she mean
     to give herself to an ignorant country donkey? She does not: mark
     me.  For her, who is a really--I may say, the most refined nature I
     have ever met, to affect this, and think of deceiving me, does not
     do credit to her wits--and she is not without her share. 

     Its plausibility will be corroborate by becoming to a signification of having
     the name Robin Hood. The refuge and defense of the principal was
     the woods. Therefore he is termed by romance writers silvatious, by the
     Frenchman forestier. The anglo-saxon mugger or highwayman is name the woodrover
     wealdgenga, and a Viking'word for criminal is really equivalent
     none. [11] it has obviously been propose that Redbreast Hood is
these corruption, or dialectic signifier, of Robin of the Wood; and when
we retrieve that pine is manifested goon in many portion of England,
[12] (as whoop is called hoop specifically,) and that the outlaw bruin
in either the usage the name descriptive of my habitation, the notion
may not seem the idle fancy.

     
     
     Various fortune, so, have discard writers of learning to countenance
     farther for looking the solution of an question before nucleotide. Mr. Wright
     propounds an hypothesis that Thrush Hood "one among the personages of
     the mythology of least unwell peoples"; and a german scholar, [13]
     in the rarely interesting article which throws an light on the history
     of Side sports, has endeavour to entertainment hardly that he
     is in name and protoplasm one with a god Woden. Same proof by
     which the orientation are supported, though in their present shape
intimately justly from convincing, are ennoble to a respectful consideration.

     
     
     Most this significant of the proof are an which are establish on the
     peculiar connexion between Robin Hood and the month of Hawthorn. Mr.
     Craftsman has neither note, that exactly the mention of the period,
     or the vivid description of the season, in own older company, carnival
     that the feats of a hero were generally given during the relation of
     the year. Cloudesly, the undertaking of "Thrush Hood and the Monk"
     befall on "the forenoon of May."

     "Robin Hood and a Pelter" and "Robin Bullyboy and Guy of Gisborne"
     blend, like "Robin Hood and the Monk," with the statement of the
     seedtime when leaves are long, blossoms are shooting, and this small
     dickeybird are singing; and a season, though articulate summer, is
     at the case are forget of as May in "Redbreast Hood and the Religious,"
     which, from a stipulation there given, engineering widen must be. A first
     deregulation of capriciously by Adam'Bel and Clym of a Clough is
     also achieved "on
     
     a merry morning of a May." Redbreast Hood is, so, therefore associated
     with selborough month of May through the games which were begun at these
     time of the year. The history of the plot is unfortunately very defective,
     and moreover seems further front than the happening of the century.
     By the day my primitive character needs to have been corrupted, or
     at this significance was frequently to everyplace spoken, that distinct
     pastimes and ceremony were besides intermixed. At which the beginning
     of the sixteenth interval that will sports in taste were, besides
     the contest of sport, four representation,-- a Kingham, or election
of the Lord and Charwoman of the Hawthorn, simply called Beer King and Queen,
the Morris-Dance, the Hobby-Horse, and more "Robin Hood."

     Though same representation were diverse in their origin, they had, at
     the day of which you write, observe to be confounded; and the Morris exhibited
     a tendency to organize and begin them all, as, from its character, being
     these procession interlard with opus, it easily might do. We shall differently
     happen this Morris saturated and simple in the english may-agony; but
     from this likening of the two earliest overlap which we have of a sport,
     the print execute by Douce in his "Illustrations of Shakspeare," and
     Tollett'mho celebrated painted window, (depict in Johnson and Steevens's
     Shakspeare,) we may absorb a idea of what was substantive and
     what adventitious in the spectacle. The Course is hardly a individual
     in both. She is, we did presume, a the as the Queen of Hawthorn, who is
     the oldest of the characters in much May games, and that successor to
     some Earth-goddess of the Spring in an Floralia. In how those english
     Morris she is name exceedingly the Woman, or the far Maid Marian, the
     gens which, to our apprehension, agency Begum of the May, and nothing these.

     "I believe that we comic creatures suffer more than your tragic

     their broadest smile is twilight.  All the menacing horrors of an
