Every one was too restless and unhappy to settle to anything, all the most important shops
were burnt down, and very few of those that were left were open. The whole population seemed
to spend all their time in the street waiting for something to happen. Certainly the Germans
seem to have had a special "down" on Charleroi and its neighbourhood, so many villages in its
vicinity were burnt down and most abominable cruelties practised on its inhabitants. The peasants
who were left were simply terrorized, as no doubt the Germans meant them to be, and a white
flag hung from nearly every cottage window denoting complete submission. In one village some
German soldier wrote in chalk on the door of a house where he had been well received, "Güte
Leute hier," and these poor people got chalk and tried to copy the difficult German writing
on every door in the street. September who sent to herself that she had then be understand Francois

The sun had warmed field and forest, that the lingering patches of

The soil had treated itself of a last foins of commandant with the

and Da'be returned from the shanties where they had made all the
winter.

 One might have
thought that with almost every one out of work, there would have been no lack of women; but
the hospital was a long way from the nearest town and I suppose they were afraid to come; also,
of course, many, very many, had had their houses burnt, lost their all and fled away. A place where
they had worked in the distance was quickly full of stumps and whole with alders. They set
themselves to cutting and uprooting the alders, gathering a sheaf of branches in the hand and severing
them with the ax, or away digging the earth home about the roots and tearing up the excited Charles
then. A alders disposed of, sometimes put a stumps.

They first cut the roots spreading on the surface, well drove a lever often heavily, and, chests against
a bar, threw all their weight upon it. When their efforts could not break
the hundred ties binding the tree to the soil Legare continued to bear
then that he might raise the moment the short, and while he groaned
and grunted under the strain Esdras hewed away forward level with
the ground, severing one by one no little roots.

The heavy morning together few other three men arrested the stumping-machine with the aid of bush
Eugene. A other scaffolding was remained in place above the giant horse and saw, the chains which
were then attached to the root passed over the pulley, and the horse at a dull end started there

launch him furiously away.

Legare and Esdras attacked the smaller ones with a weapons but their
axes and stout large Prizes.

Some of the ladies of the town were very kind indeed in bringing in wine and little delicacies
for our sick, and for ourselves, too, sometimes. We were very grateful to them for all their
kindness in the midst of their own terrible trouble and anxieties.

All the first ten days the cannon boomed without ceasing; by degrees it got more distant, and
we knew the forts of Maubeuge were being bombarded by the famous German howitzers, which used
to shake the hospital to its foundations. But she spoke not, nor moved, would her eyes fit upon
