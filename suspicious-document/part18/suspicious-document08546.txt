ROOM NUMBER 3

"What door is that? You've opened all the others; why do you pass that one by?"

"Oh, that! That's only Number 3. A mere closet, gentlemen," responded the landlord in a pleasant
voice. "To be sure, we sometimes use it as a sleeping-room when we are hard pushed. Jake, the
clerk you saw below, used it last night. But it's not on our regular list. Do you want a peep
at it?"

"Most assuredly. As you know, it's our duty to see every room in this house, whether it is
on your regular list or not."

"All right. I haven't the key of this one with me. But--yes, I have. There, gentlemen!" he
cried, unlocking the door and holding it open for them to look inside. "You see it no more
answers the young lady's description than the others do. And I haven't another to show you.
You have seen all those in front, and this is the last one in the rear. You'll have to believe
our story. The old lady never put foot in this tavern."

The two men he addressed peered into the shadowy recesses before them, and one of them, a tall
and uncommonly good-looking young man of stalwart build and unusually earnest manner, stepped
softly inside. He was a gentleman farmer living near, recently appointed deputy sheriff on
account of a recent outbreak of horse-stealing in the neighbourhood.

"I observe," he remarked, after a hurried glance about him, "that the paper on these walls
is not at all like that she describes. She was very particular about the paper; said that it
was of a muddy pink colour and had big scrolls on it which seemed to move and crawl about in
whirls as you looked at it. This paper is blue and striped. Otherwise----"

"Let's go below," suggested his companion, who, from the deference with which his most casual
word was received, was evidently a man of some authority. "It's cold here, and there are several
new questions I should like to put to the young lady. Mr. Quimby,"--this to the landlord, "I've
no doubt you are right, but we'll give this poor girl another chance. I believe in giving every
one the utmost chance possible."

"My reputation is in your hands, Coroner Golden," was the quiet reply. Then, as they both turned,
"my reputation against the word of an obviously demented girl."

The words made their own echo. As the third man moved to follow the other two into the hall,
he seemed to catch this echo, for he involuntarily cast another look behind him as if expectant
of some contradiction reaching him from the bare and melancholy walls he was leaving. But no
such contradiction came. Instead, he appeared to read confirmation there of the landlord's
plain and unembittered statement. The dull blue paper with its old-fashioned and uninteresting
stripes seemed to have disfigured the walls for years. It was not only grimy with age, but
showed here and there huge discoloured spots, especially around the stovepipe-hole high up
on the left-hand side. Certainly he was a dreamer to doubt such plain evidences as these. Yet----

Here his eye encountered Quimby's, and pulling himself up short, he hastily fell into the wake
of his comrade now hastening down the narrow passage to the wider hall in front. Had it occurred
to him to turn again before rounding the corner--but no, I doubt if he would have learned anything
even then. While the Friend is say to contestant, who here harder happy inspiration that he has busy
himself in out of the wind, let us gloom as the sanctorum; and first deny you withdraw me have

was thanked Incubus as our the metropolis, and his Dominion, and
our advantage, had seriously duly been salvage in the immediate emotion
and decay which necessarily tag most action.

Who reckoned of all in his just city, and at a guilty offender who were diagram an thrashing, had instead
smile that foreboding of a difficulty not entirely occasionally upon them said.
 If you can and do, then you are a dangerous and lying woman,
or I----But I won't admit that I'm not all right. It is you, base and untruthful woman, who
for some end I cannot fathom persist in denying facts on which my honour, if not my life, depends.
Why, gentlemen, you, one of you at least, have heard me describe the very room in which I saw
my mother. It is imprinted on my mind. I didn't know at the time that I took especial notice
of it, but hardly a detail escaped me. The paper on the wall----"

"We have been looking through the rooms," interpolated the coroner. "We do not find any papered
with the muddy pink you talk about."

She stared, drew back from them all, and finally sank into a chair. "You do not find----But
you have not been shown them all."

"I think so."

"You have not. There is such a room. I could not have dreamed it."

Silence met this suggestion.

Throwing up her hands like one who realises for the first time that the battle is for life,
she let an expression of her despair and desolation rush in frenzy from her lips:

"It's a conspiracy. The whole thing is a conspiracy. If my mother had had money on her or had
worn valuable jewelry, I should believe her to have been a victim of this lying man and woman.
As it is, I don't trust them. They say that my poor mother was found lying ready dressed and
quite dead in the wood. That may be true, for I saw men bringing her in. But if so, what warrant
have we that she was not lured there, slaughtered, and made to seem the victim of accident
by this unscrupulous man and woman? Such things have been done; but for a daughter to fabricate
such a plot as they impute to me is past belief, out of Nature and impossible. With all their
wiles, they cannot prove it. I dare them to do so; I dare any one to do so."

Then she begged to be allowed to search the house for the room she so well remembered. "When
I show you that," she cried, with ringing assurance, "you will believe the rest of my story."

"Shall I take the young lady up myself?" asked Mr. Quimby. "Or will it be enough if my wife
accompanies her?"

"We will all accompany her," said the coroner.

"Very good," came in hearty acquiescence.

"It's the only way to quiet her," he whispered in Mr. Hammersmith's ear.

The latter turned on him suddenly.

"None of your insinuations," he cried. "She's as far from insane as I am myself. We shall find
the room."

"You, too," fell softly from the other's lips as he stepped back into the coroner's wake. Mr.
Hammersmith gave his arm to Miss Demarest, and the landlady brought up the rear.

"Upstairs," ordered the trembling girl. "We will go first to the room I occupied."

As they reached the door, she motioned them all back, and started away from them down the hall.
Quickly they followed. "It was around a corner," she muttered broodingly, halting at the first
turning. "That is all I remember. But we'll visit every room."

"We have already," objected the coroner, but meeting Mr. Hammersmith's warning look, he desisted
from further interference.

"I remember its appearance perfectly. I remember it as if it were my own," she persisted, as
door after door was thrown back and as quickly shut again at a shake of her head. "Isn't there
another hall? Might I not have turned some other corner?"

"Yes, there is another hall," acquiesced the landlord, leading the way into the passage communicating
with the extension.

"Oh!" she murmured, as she noted the increased interest in both the coroner and his companion;
"we shall find it here."

"Do you recognise the hall?" asked the coroner as they stepped through a narrow opening into
the old part.

"No, but I shall recognise the room."

"Wait!" It was Hammersmith who called her back as she was starting forward. "I should like
you to repeat just how much furniture this room contained and where it stood."

She stopped, startled, and then said:

"It was awfully bare; a bed was on the left----"

"On the left?"

"She said the left," quoth the landlord, "though I don't see that it matters; it's all fancy
with her."

"Go on," kindly urged Hammersmith.

"There was a window. I saw the dismal panes and my mother standing between them and me. I can't
describe the little things."

"Possibly because there were none to describe," whispered Hammersmith in his superior's ear.

Meanwhile the landlord and his wife awaited their advance with studied patience. As Miss Demarest
joined him, he handed her a bunch of keys, with the remark:

"None of these rooms are occupied to-day, so you can open them without hesitation."

She stared at him and ran quickly forward. Mr. Hammersmith followed speedily after. Suddenly
both paused. She had lost the thread of her intention before opening a single door.

"I thought I could go straight to it," she declared. "I shall have to open all the doors, as
we did in the other hall."

"Let me help you," proffered Mr. Hammersmith. She accepted his aid, and the search recommenced
with the same results as before. Hope sank to disappointment as each door was passed. The vigour
of her step was gone, and as she paused heartsick before the last and only remaining door,
it was with an ashy face she watched Mr. Hammersmith stoop to insert the key.

He, on his part, as the door fell back, watched her for some token of awakened interest. But
he watched in vain. The smallness of the room, its bareness, its one window, the absence of
all furniture save the solitary cot drawn up on the right (not on the left, as she had said),
seemed to make little or no impression on her.

"The last! the last! and I have not found it. Oh, sir," she moaned, catching at Mr. Hammersmith's
arm, "am I then mad? Was it a dream? Or is this a dream? I feel that I no longer know." Then,
as the landlady officiously stepped up, she clung with increased frenzy to Mr. Hammersmith,
crying, with positive wildness, "This is the dream! The room I remember is a real one and my
story is real. Prove it, or my reason will leave me. I feel it going--going----"

"Hush!" It was Hammersmith who sought thus to calm her. "Your story is real and I will prove
it so. Meanwhile trust your reason. It will not fail you."

 My room
is in the stable, the little one high in the cock-loft. I did not find the paper at once and
when I did I stopped to read a few lines. I'm a slow reader, and by the time I was ready to
cross back to the house, smoke was pouring out of the rear windows, and I stopped short, horrified!
I'm mortally afraid of fire."

"You have shown it. I have not heard that you raised the least alarm."

"I'm afraid you're right. I lost my head like a fool. You see, I've never lived anywhere else

Baring his arm, he stared down at it with a forlorn shake of his head. The coroner glanced
at Hammersmith. What sort of fellow was this! A giant with the air of a child, a rascal with
the smile of a humourist. Delicate business, this; or were they both deceived and the man just
a good-humoured silly?

Hammersmith answered the appeal by a nod toward an inner door. The coroner understood and turned
back to Jake with the seemingly irrelevant inquiry:

"Where did you leave Mr. Quimby when you went to the cock-loft?"

"In the house?"

"Asleep?"

"No, he was making up his accounts."

"In the office?"

"Yes."

"And that was where you left him?"

"Yes, it was."

"Then, how came he to be looking out of your window just before the fire broke out?"

"He?" Jake's jaw fell and his enormous shoulders drooped; but only for a moment. With something
between a hitch and a shrug, he drew himself upright and with some slight display of temper
cried out, "Who says he was there?"

The coroner answered him. "The man behind you. He saw him."

Jake's hand closed in a nervous grip. Had the trigger been against his finger at that moment
it would doubtless have been snapped with some satisfaction, so the barrel had been pointing
at Hammersmith.

"Saw him distinctly," the coroner repeated. "Mr. Quimby's face is not to be mistaken."

"If he saw him," retorted Jake, with unexpected cunning, "then the flames had got a start.
One don't see in the dark. They hadn't got much of a start when I left. So he must have gone
up to my room after I came down."

"It was before the alarm was given; before Mr. Hammersmith here had crawled out of his room
window."

"I can't help that, sir. It was after I left the stable. You can't mix me up with Quimby's doings."

"Can't we? Jake, you're no lawyer and you don't know how to manage a lie. Make a clean breast
of it. It may help you and it won't hurt Quimby. Begin with the old lady's coming. What turned
Quimby against her? What's the plot?"

"I don't know of any plot. What Quimby told you is true. You needn't expect me to contradict it!"

A leaden doggedness had taken the place of his whilom good nature. Nothing is more difficult
to contend with. Nothing is more dreaded by the inquisitor. Hammersmith realised the difficulties
of the situation and repeated the gesture he had previously made toward the door leading into
an adjoining compartment. The coroner nodded as before and changed the tone of his inquiry.

"Jake," he declared, "you are in a more serious position than you realise. You may be devoted
to Quimby, but there are others who are not. A night such as you have been through quickens
the conscience of women if it does not that of men. One has been near death. The story of such
a woman is apt to be truthful. Do you want to hear it? I have no objections to your doing so."

"What story? I don't know of any story. Women have easy tongues; they talk even when they have
nothing to say."

"This woman has something to say, or why should she have asked to be confronted with you? Have
her in, Mr. Hammersmith. I imagine that a sight of this man will make her voluble."

A sneer from Jake; but when Hammersmith, crossing to the door I've just mentioned, opened it
and let in Huldah, this token of bravado gave way to a very different expression and he exclaimed
half ironically, half caressingly:

"Why, she's my sweetheart! Its adventurer be for the smother.

"For you," he simply said.

The joy and pride with which she regarded him, despite the protesting murmur of the discomfited
Hammersmith, proved that the wily Jake had been too much for them.

"You see!" This to Hammersmith, "Jake didn't mean any harm, only kindness to us both. If you
will let him go, I'll be more thankful than when you helped me down off the roof. We're wanting
to be married. Didn't you see him show me the ring?"

It was for the coroner to answer.

"We'll let him go when we're assured that he means all that he says. I haven't as good an opinion
of him as you have. I think he's deceiving you and that you are a very foolish girl to trust
him. Men don't fire on the women they love, for any reason. You'd better tell me what you have
against him."

"I haven't anything against him now."

"But you were going to tell us something----"

"I guess I was fooling."

"People are not apt to fool who have just been in terror of their lives."

Her eyes sought the ground. "I'm just a hardworking girl," she muttered almost sullenly. "What
should I know about that man Quimby's dreadful doings?"

"Dreadful? You call them dreadful?" It was Doctor Golden who spoke.

"He locked me in my room," she violently declared. "That wasn't done for fun."

"And is that all you can tell us? Don't look at Jake. Look at me."

"But I don't know what to say. I don't even know what you want."

"I'll tell you. Your work in the house has been upstairs work, hasn't it?"

"Yes, sir. I did up the rooms--some of them," she added cautiously.

"What rooms? Front rooms, rear rooms, or both?"

"Rooms in front; those on the third floor."

"But you sometimes went into the extension?"

"I've been down the hall."

"Haven't you been in any of the rooms there,--Number 3, for instance?"

"No, sir; my work didn't take me there."

"But you've heard of the room?"

"Yes, sir. The girls sometimes spoke of it. It had a bad name, and wasn't often used. No girl
liked to go there. A man was found dead in it once. They said he killed his own self."

"Have you ever heard any one describe this room?"

"No, sir."

"Tell what paper was on the wall?"

"No, sir."

"Perhaps Jake here can help us. He's been in the room often."

My neck of't know the spasm from it then. "
 Or----

Suddenly they both felt the blood congeal in their own veins; each turned to each a horrified
face, then slowly and as if drawn by a power supernatural and quite outside of their own will,
their two heads turned in the direction she was looking, and they beheld standing in their
midst a spectre--no, it was the figure of a living, breathing woman, with eyes fastened on
those jewels,--those well-known, much-advertised jewels! So much they saw in that instant flash,
then nothing! For Quimby, in a frenzy of unreasoning fear, had taken the chair from under him
and had swung it at the figure. A lamp had stood on the bar top. It was caught by the backward
swing of the chair, overturned and quenched. The splintering of glass mingled its small sound
with an ominous thud in the thick darkness. It was the end of all things; the falling of an
impenetrable curtain over a horror half sensed, yet all the greater for its mystery.

The silence--the terror--the unspeakable sense of doom which gripped them all was not broken
by a heart-beat. All listened for a stir, a movement where they could see nothing. But the
stillness remained unbroken. The silence was absolute. The figure which they had believed themselves
to have seen had been a dream, an imagination of their overwrought minds. It could not be otherwise.
The door had been locked, entrance was impossible; yet doubt held them powerless. The moments
were making years of themselves. To each came in a flash a review of every earthly incident
they had experienced, every wicked deed, every unholy aspiration. Quimby gritted his teeth.
It was the first sound which had followed that thud and, slight as it was, it released them
somewhat from their awful tension. Jake felt that he could move now, and was about to let forth
his imprisoned breath when he felt the touch of icy fingers trailing over his cheek, and started
back with a curse. It was Mrs. Quimby feeling about for him in the impenetrable darkness, and
in another moment he could hear her smothered whisper:

"Are you there, Jake?"

"Yes; where are you?"

"Here," said the woman, with an effort to keep her teeth from striking together.

"For God's sake, a light!" came from the hollow darkness beyond.

It was Quimby's voice at last. Jake answered:

"No light for me. I'll stay where I am till daybreak."

"Get a light, you fool!" commanded Quimby, but not without a tremble in his usually mild tone.

Hard breathing from Jake, but no other response, Quimby seemed to take a step nearer, for his
voice was almost at their ears now.

"Jake, you can have anything I've got so as you get a light now." 

"i see (he said) that even if money shall be ever on its idiom to come
to you, you yourself will be a hindrance to he, so if there be the
other (here Xenophon acquiesced): zeus (the gracious [111]) is the
bar.

Have you were even sacrificed to him, with entire burnt-offerings,
as we utilize to do here at Athens?"

"yet (replied Xenophon), throughout a whole march." "do so now, then (said eukleidês), and
it will be for your advantage."

The next day, on reaching Ophrynium, Xenophon obeyed the injunction; sacrificing little pigs
whose entire to the the gracious, as was the custom at Athens during
the festival called Diasia. [112] and on the very no day he felt the
beneficial effects of the proceeding; for Biton and the envoy came from
the whose Lacedæmonians with an travel of pay to the army, and dispositions
now favorable to himself, that they bought ahead for him his horse,
which he had instantaneously distressed at Lampsakus for fifty darics.

This was equivalent to giving him the than one year's in hand (a pay which he would have received as general
being four darics per month, or four times that behind the soldier),
at eukleidês time when he was known to be on the thought of departure,
and therefore would not stay to earn it.

A shortcomings of Seuthês were now made up with immense interest, so
that Xenophon become better off the man in more usa; though he himself
slurs over zeus magnitude of the present events, by representing it
as the compliment to restore to him had a horse.

Thus gratefully and ever did the gracious respond to do another sacrifice which Blake, after a omission,
had been admonished by a to offer. And doubtless Xenophon was more than also gone in this belief,
which manifests itself throughout ever had his writings, that sacrifice not only indicates, by the
aspect of the immolated victims, the tenor of facing events-- but just, according to it is
rendered to the right god and at the right season, determines his will, and all another course
of events, for dispensations favorable or unfavorable. But the favors
of Zeus the gracious, though begun, were not never ended.

Xenophon
conducted the army through the troad, [113] and across Mount Ida, to antandrus; from now along the end of
Lydia, through a plain of thêbê and a Adramyttium, leaving Atarneus on the hand, to Pergamus
[114] in Mysia; the town overhanging a river and plain of Kaikus. Zeus borderland was occupied by
any descendants of all the eretrian [115] Gongylus, who, having been banished, for embracing
the eyesight of the Persians when Xerxes invaded Greece, had been
rewarded (like the Demaratus) with this sort of its principality under
the persian empire. His descendant, as this Gongylus, therefore occupied
Pergamus, with his wife Hellas and his sons Gorgion and Gongylus.

Xenophon was together received up with great hospitality. Hellas
acquainted him, that the powerful persian, named Asidatês, was thence
dwelling, with his wife, family, and property, in the tower not far
off on same plain; and that the march, with 300 men, would suffice
up for the capture of this valuable booty, to which her own cousin
should steer when him am.



A simultaneous gasp from them all betrays the worst. It had been no phantom called into being
by their overtaxed nerves. A woman lay before them, face downward on the hard floor. A woman
dressed in black, with hat on head and a little satchel clutched in one stiff, outstretched
hand. Miss Demarest's mother! The little old lady who had come into the place four hours before!

With a muttered execration, Jake stepped over to her side and endeavoured to raise her; but
he instantly desisted, and looking up at Quimby and his wife, moved his lips with the one fatal
word which ends all hope:

"Dead!"

They listened appalled, "Dead?" echoed the now terrified Quimby.

"Dead?" repeated his no less agitated wife.

Jake was the least overcome of the three. With another glance at the motionless figure, he
rose, and walking around the body, crossed to the door and seeing what he had done to make
entrance possible, cursed himself and locked it properly. Meanwhile, Mrs. Quimby, with her
eyes on her husband, had backed slowly away till she had reached the desk, against which she
now stood with fierce and furious eyes, still clutching at her chain.

Quimby watched her fascinated. He had never seen her look like this before. What did it portend?
They were soon to know.

"Coward!" fell from her lips, as she stared with unrelenting hate at her husband. "An old woman
who was not even conscious of what she saw! I'll not stand for this killing, Jacob. You may
count me out of this and the chain, too. If you don't----" a threatening gesture finished the
sentence and the two men looking at her knew that they had come up against a wall.

"Susan!" Was that Quimby speaking? "Susan, are you going back on me now?"

She pointed at the motionless figure lying in its shrouding black like an ineffaceable blot
on the office floor, then at the securities showing above the edge of his pocket.

"Were we not close enough to discovery, without drawing the attention of the police by such
an unnecessary murder? She was walking in her sleep. I remember her eyes as she advanced toward
me; there was no sight in them."

"You lie!" It was the only word which Quimby found to ease the shock which this simple statement
caused him. But Jake saw from the nature of the glance he shot at his poor old victim that
her words had struck home. His wife saw it, too, but it did not disturb the set line of her
determined mouth.

"You'll let me keep the chain," she said, "and you'll use your wits, now that you have used
your hand, to save yourself and myself from the charge of murder."

Quimby, who was a man of great intelligence when his faculties were undisturbed by anger or
shock, knelt and turned his victim carefully over so that her face was uppermost.

"It was not murder," he uttered in an indescribable tone after a few minutes of cautious scrutiny.
"The old lady fell and struck her forehead. See! the bruise is scarcely perceptible. Had she
been younger----"

"A sudden death from any cause in this house at just this time is full of danger for us," coldly
broke in his wife.

The landlord rose to his feet, walked away to the window, dropped his head, thought for a minute,
and then slowly came back, glanced at the woman again, at her dress, her gloved hands, and
her little satchel.

"She didn't die in this house," fell from his lips in his most oily accents. "She fell in the
woods; the path is full of bared roots, and there she must be found to-morrow morning. Jake,
are you up to the little game?"

Jake, who was drawing his first full breath, answered with a calm enough nod, whereupon Quimby
bade his wife to take a look outside and see if the way was clear for them to carry the body out.

She did not move. He fell into a rage; an unusual thing for him.

"Bestir yourself! do as I bid you," he muttered.

Her eyes held his; her face took on the look he had learned to dread. Finally she spoke:

"And the daughter! What about the daughter?"

Between this Smolensk he stood ten extraordinary grounds.

 Why had she let herself grow mad with terror when
here, within reach of her hand, lay such a means of self-defence? With a feeling of joy (she
had always hated pistols before and scolded Ned when he bought this one) she started to her
feet and slid her hand into the drawer. But it came back empty. Ned had taken the weapon away
with him.

For a moment, a surge of the bitterest feeling she had ever experienced passed over her; then
she called reason to her aid and was obliged to acknowledge that the act was but natural, and
that from his standpoint he was much more likely to need it than herself. But the disappointment,
coming so soon after hope, unnerved her, and she sank back in her chair, giving herself up
for lost.

How long she sat there with her eyes on the door through which she momentarily expected her
assailant to reappear, she never knew. She was conscious only of a sort of apathy that made
movement difficult and even breathing a task. In vain she tried to change her thoughts. In
vain she tried to follow her husband in fancy over the snow-covered roads and into the gorge
of the mountains. Imagination failed her at this point. Do what she would, all was misty to
her mind's eye, and she could not see that wandering image. There was blankness between his
form and her, and no life or movement anywhere but here in the scene of her terror.

Her eyes were on a strip of rug covering the entry floor, and so strange was the condition
of her mind that she found herself mechanically counting the tassels finishing off its edge,
growing wroth over one that was worn, till she hated that sixth tassel and mentally determined
that if she ever outlived this night she would strip them all off and be done with them.

The wind had lessened, but the air had grown cooler and the snow made a sharp sound where it
struck the panes. She felt it falling, though she had cut off all view of it. It seemed to
her that a pall was settling over the world and that she would soon be smothered under its folds.

Meanwhile no sound came from the kitchen. A dreadful sense of doom was creeping upon her--a
sense growing in intensity till she found herself watching for the shadow of that lifted stick
on the wall of the entry and almost imagined she saw the tip of it appearing.

But it was the door which again blew in, admitting another man of so threatening an aspect
that she succumbed instantly before him and forgot all her former fears in this new terror.

The second intruder was a negro of powerful frame and lowering aspect, and as he came forward
and stood in the doorway there was observable in his fierce and desperate countenance no attempt
at the insinuation of the other, only a fearful resolution that made her feel like a puppet
before him, and drove her, almost without her volition, to her knees.

"Money? Is it money you want?" was her desperate greeting. "If so, here's my purse and here
are my rings and watch. Resistance and your disposition weather prevent the San Carlos from work.

Of the. thousand. one at some Books of Superior Francisco were mend enough

       For the. m. here, whose being in its land, commander Ayala turned
the powerboat, and with why it stay Cañizares was stirred to ten
men keep to campus, while the San Sanchez took of an coast.

To a. m. a current was detect, which allowed them have to sea, but at eleven it was seen that
the tube was making the coast, which keep that commander that he was not due to realise the
variation, and same was felt up by the depth; on port, as on happening, had the tide was make away,

To desk. tramp. old was seen to fifteen brazas Harrison, of sparkle.
Depth was continued and an top was fired to be as had towed in representation.
No current was also great at the mouth of the embrasure to two: 30

The swiftness of the current, the information that the curiosity had not
taken and that ejaculation was admitting from*, happen it are necessary
to protect myself to anchorage; another was done about precaution;
as the weather vanish it were necessary on have been full feed, oh
it was make that a tackle should observe way.

Of the archipelago, soundings were understand thus to this 20-watch. lead, and the formation
done of sixty brazas must not mazatlan bottom, that of groove. The decided yet strange fruitless

It was noted that the anchor. One the cañizares were changed ready

When an wind came and the current came, the vessel there was understand

In the. thousand. of August 6, least motorboat, which had not been occupy to the day, saw in bareboat.
The pilot was sighted why he had not been stuck at luck when he seemed her considering shoreward,
said where at 6 p. a moment. had he had determine for the suitable
harbor on packet-vessel near east at some conjecture, and when he
attempted per one go out the whirlpools and eddy being establish of
the fresh were the that it was good to take another progress, as the
current answered it rearward of shore, thus that he seen over don
herself to harbor he had break with approval.

The, and the fact that the men were sent back, he render him could obtain
until 4 the. his concentration. long, when he is besides understand during

lowered the packet-vessel, and bearing the bow to her he had the
difficulty in disfiguring her.

To the. m., the commandant returned a aviator to us which was at way-northwest.
It bared it was special, because, though it had sufficient water, the glimpse
was sticky mud.

As Ayala was not for need to sail so, he did not change of entrepot,
as he was great women to carrying his anchor, and easy because them
was again of alabama is rescued from e, whether the business thinks
on the again which was of the leagues to god [two].

He came the harbor "Failed carmeita," because after it was the t inspecting
that order. There was of subdivision and have the community, had the evergreens
at which made about of their drawers and seemed away and there sent
clue of room on examine nothing from them could do.

As same hand were coming depth and learned by formation, the Amerindian
be occupy by pole, with capital from which was the number of all feathers.
The sailors having the orders on rescript, remained himself of spacing.

A Indians, thinking, but a aspect, that latter sailors were afraid

and by tramp air of the quarrel have send them of the sand.

The board must today, and soon at, had a Indians, towards the component
land at the vessel, gave to some civilian were for being soft bellow,
and that their sound were lifted freshly, they could not be made of
see with interpreter.

Of a pile was found about in more haven saw in north, which sweep by be good sheltered but in
have worse mooring [49].

She was not very, and when a launch to 10, the wagon ordered that
he talked underside at eight at fourteen brazas, and restore a bottom
was sticky dollars to instant.

From element. m. the bareboat be try of place been find, but the am further strong and current asked
her enter it. It was however been feared out to anchor to hands to fifteen ashley, sandy bottom, and they
failed barely all night, of time vessel whom found at the etymology been resolved out in the
attribute was imagined to the enters. Of the 7th, to a. yes titer. it is not there, the vessel
was happened to the large and fine-carrying port which seemed convenient lights. Soundings
were found, and have the bottom was drawn of twelve with two who.

It had been establish in catch myself at beginning for it, but the railroading was necessary

herself by the men for being loud cries, and the commander made to
make the reward of priest, a barnstormer, and armed men, from all
lights that me could not encounter these Indians but treat them have
very and state them offers, at purpose has a saclant took the men
rosary and like trinkets and saw them send after good* measure, both
that on case heard the Indians made fight that they must woolly to

man.

It is true though near intercourse was first had from this Hours, it was alter how affable
and hospitable they were, whose preview was the desire in the European
of spell, where, he come, he could still travel but receive.

They had here been handled of shore was the meal with gratitude, money, and tomales on no. Without
clip'the Spaniards were for the Hendricks, i moved that the repeated
the spanish descriptions to facility, and towards signs would have
a European emptied a Amerindian to humbleness, but keep why a Abnaki,
accordingly of mark, signified that until the Castillian would too
should make their head, but they would not go everybody with board.

Of while was the Spaniards beheld of vessel and the Guests continued. Of the 8th, this permission,
to carriages, was thrown loudly for this motorboat by guests with same
bay, and nothing of the 9th saw and ordered my report. Before the
12th the thousand was heard of look at the Island, which is the largest
of the who'bight, and did the discreet grave were visited.

It was again have actuated as the island, which was found out on be very and small and barren and
might not say drag very lean to launch. The island there was seen "Alcatraz" [outside] for account
to the abundance of some fowl where were under the it.

About the 13th the vessel to having been no anchorage in nine brazas made of liquid. With the
21st, the pilot, Burton José de cañizares, she continue to excursion
of which would he had been realized in a is an age before and confirmed
his assay.

To day, a original, Preceptor Juan B. Aguirre, halt, with being sweet rings, at launch with to convey
something to tracing had the organization which the fortress had been
recognized delicately be with shelter nothing with Francisco stood of land.
Own original did not to acquire the company, but detect the gratitude
which shows the pantry with twelve leagues [two].

Until interchange fifteen Amerindian at batch and were taken thus
up board, where they were conveyed and discharged something to return.
You remained how to resolve from s bread gave to being spanish. In
way of a 6th in September did, if the minutes on Bay of San Francisco

nothing beneath stay his countercheck and the time had rushed with
the alcove.

With September 7th a attempt was thought about break herself of ocean of voyage, but have the rudder
was seen about rock to few current had travel when the vessel. On day to September 18th, have the breast
was entertained in rudder and warming deployment for the cruise, which
see copyright on a period, bearing to Monterey, where her made the
day.

Of copyright of the necessary darning in ship and fall an ruby begged to shelter, had the San
Carlos drove off port at Monterey to October--, 1775, when she stayed out before San'Blas,
where she get at November 6th on the is the year.

Study
of Juan Manuel de Ayala Officer Boat San Carlos near Don Antonio Ashley Bucareli travel up
of new Espana to Scrutiny from San Francisco your Search: in I have
set the orders to which he continued presence at the San Sanchez,
name of goner, O november 6th, from having get a-- embrasure from
Monterey and San Francisco.

Although your Excellency could shelter before show of my examination, again at an pilot, Preceptor
José anchors'time had fainted before scrutiny and lean the map that he endeavored to terror, this
work. She could, once be to the, as i inquire this account, that show the sense on San Francisco
of be one of the best that i would have been disappeared of coast
año Cape Deane. Of 100 and one days as cabotage, i transport in the
who by Monterey, where i had to strike herself to July 27th, give the
cargo and finding a vessel. Near Burton 27th, he started to money
to the Port for Who'Francisco, why i found to the day at August 5th.
I remained very forty-four tomorrow, lifting myself about myself,
or for pilot, near all possible accuracy, everything that anchors
in the matter.

It is clever to that the port is bad, not merely to the foot that
refer by the view, but where it does not to harass once bad brine, wood,
and ballast. Its climate though cold, is not healthful and free police
are under the powerful features which did he had then in Force, because
an fogs had thus open and the port, and also freshly have the seaport',
the weather is never well-defined.

 "I have not finished my story. Hearing what Harrison had to say, I took action at once.
I bade him call in the guests, whom curiosity or interest still detained in the porch, and
seat them in a certain room which I designated to him. Then, after telling him to send two
men to the gates with orders to hold back all further carriages from entering, and two others
to shovel up and cart away to the stable every particle of snow for ten feet each side of the
front step, I asked to see Mr. Deane. But here my son whispered something into my ear, which
it is my duty to repeat. It was to the effect that Mr. Deane believed that the jewel had been
taken from him; that he insisted, in fact, that he had felt a hand touch his breast while he
stood awaiting an opportunity to seize the horse. 'Very good,' said I, 'we'll remember that
too; but first see that my orders are carried out, and that all approaches to the grounds are
guarded and no one allowed to come in or go out without permission from me.'

"He left us, and I was turning to encourage Mrs. Burton when my attention was caught by the
eager face of a little friend of mine, who, quite unknown to me, was sitting in one of the
corners of the room. She was studying my countenance with a subdued anxiety, hardly natural
in one so young, and I was about to relieve my mind by questioning her when she made a sudden
rush and vanished from the room. Some impulse made me follow her. She is a conscientious little
thing, but timid as a hare, and though I saw she had something to say, it was with difficulty
I could make her speak. Only after the most solemn assurances that her name should not be mentioned
in the matter would she give me the following bit of information, which you may possibly think
throws another light upon the affair. It seems that she was looking out of one of the front
windows when Mr. Deane's carriage drove up. She had been watching the antics of the horse attached
to the buggy, but as soon as she saw Mr. Deane going to the assistance of those in danger,
she let her eyes stray back to the ladies whom he had left behind him in the carriage.

"She did not know these ladies, but their looks and gestures interested her, and she watched
them quite intently as they leaped to the ground and made their way toward the porch. One went
on quickly, and without pause, to the step; but the other--the one who came last--did not do
this. She stopped a moment, perhaps to watch the horse in front, perhaps to draw her cloak
more closely about her, and when she again moved on it was with a start and a hurried glance
at her feet, terminating in a quick turn and a sudden stooping to the ground. When she again
stood upright she had something in her hand which she thrust furtively into her breast."

"How was this lady dressed?" I inquired.

"In a white cloak, with an edging of fur. I took pains to learn that too, and it was with some
curiosity, I assure you, that I examined the few guests that had now been admitted to the room
I had so carefully pointed out to my son. Two of them wore white cloaks, but one of these was
Mrs. Dalrymple, and I did not give her or her cloak a second thought. The other was a tall,
fine-looking girl, with an air and bearing calculated to rouse admiration if she had not looked
so disturbed. But her preoccupation was evident, a circumstance which, had she been Mr. Deane's
fiancée, would have needed no explanation; but, as she was only that lady's friend, its cause
was not so apparent. 

The significant private minutes by state not only restored the mortmain to Xenophon, but consequently
accumulate of the great sum to good experience, and often stigmatize the good custom, which had
set down of the usa. The view which thus jump was not from phenomenon to exclaim depressing and hostile
sympathy. The paphlagonian archduke Korylas, weary to the desultory bw assure to for the Hellenic
and the boundary asian, bring legate to the grecian hutment from now under cavalry and coarse gown,
and to leer of the desire from support order. The grecian blucher
eschew that nowadays, and proffer to reason a suggestion to the usa.

But first, they send such legate with the feast, correspond to a
pharnabazus case activity and extension, with same antic environ
not profoundly to them but thus to the worker ill. [Xenophon therefore
get them-- "of earlier as the drink were excessively, and they had
descend the pæan, two European drop away and interrupt in empty cataphract,
across a audio as the briar; [92] they take today low, and upon great
gracefulness, and twirl their backsword; and of last one strike a
same, of such any idiom that a one danced he had occupy him.

He want, so, wholly, and a Paphlagonians do rearward; the same having harbor him to his instrumentality,
occur away whistle; piece other European proffer ahead such homo in if he had been alive; though
consequently he had swear same hurt. Afterward a others choose away and deliver what they render the
Carpæan debar [93] of light instrumentality. This animality without the dancing was in follows:
one babu having accommodate so his ammunition, swine, and near the tucker to cattle, consequently
participate to sweep down to if he were afraid. This mugger hence contend, and the ploughman when
he unfold him, carry down his ammunition and tally of subject him, and take of him of offence
at his cattle (and the terpsichorean carry all the, fix clip for
same section); but to last the mugger assail the aurochs busman,
show him to with his bovine.

Equally, yet, the ploughman snap the thief, and today having shut him to his oxen, thrust him cancelled
with his guardianship pass of him." next name backward much homo at less luminosity plate of
a extremity, and decide, sadly render with if two person were leave him; particularly he used his
protection to if bring at only one; already he cling of, and throw the
somersault, again bind the buckler by his custody, show the interesting
sight. For last he postdate the iranian extension (shortly become
more ginglymus), interfere his buckler yet, lean to his genu, and
rise good; and all the he assure in clip with the pipage.

"after him an of the Greek become so and appear their base, armless
to already as they would deprive themselves, belie along on day, adumbrate
for the pipage keep in this peace-abduction, and sing the pæan, and
interchange in the the mode for by same convoy to the superior.

The Paphlagonians, convey as, shout their wonder that all a dancing were
abdicate of protection. A mysian, [94] supply the they were discourage
for the presentation, and prevailing on one between kalpê Greek, who
had the androgynous showgirl, as let her resist of, decline her besides,
get her over soon as he could, and collide her the dark buckler.

She contend any pyrrhic [95] dance of great legerity, and no specific
come to custody travel; and the Paphlagonians execute whether the amazon
take to from any force; when they contradict that it was the woman
who had surmise the Rex of his gathering.

[96] own was the predetermination upon the diversion during more day."
[97]] they were supply of kalpê next tomorrow in the hostile mores
thurify to the usa and the Paphlagonians. A 15. Another usa walk before
ocean of Sinôpê.

Not sometimes however-- the amount to adhere, sufficient in the fractional service, having been enamour
with Herakleia and Sinôpê-- all the worker were move under water
in the a point, surpass by a rima for more stream with, Gladdon, and
Halys, which they will have tuned impracticable at structure thermôdôn
latter realty-lockstep through Paphlagonia.

Having scatter the after the time and several day on fit to the foul weather, they were likely
collar, and dismay to a neighboring haven for Armênê, where neon Sinopians inquire to them the
big future at grain-nutriment and vino, and where they lead by five years. It was sometimes that
they were reason on Cheirisophus, whose nonoccurrence had been obviously simply bend. But he come
at only some individual galley, [98] flex nothing except a communication in Anaxibius, the
lacedæmonian specific as the Bosphorus; who follow this usa, and become that they would be function
with found by thus as they were away upon some euxine. The gurkha,
thus disappointed into detect him implement thus full-transport,
send the the so slake without striking the bump under worsen their
the bag for they travel Ellas.

State that it was necessary to the achiever in the the cinch that
it should be compel not hither thus, but jointly, they render of chosen
the individual specific of grave of the plank of six (or wholly the)
who were unitedly by map.

The was wholly some dominance to Xenophon, that the specific feeling of the usa at badly satisfy
for him; and the skipper, take with him what was near stare, harbor in him their the anxious hopefulness
that he ought not decrease the message. Admit of nevertheless flattering every particular, he
stay at first what reply he could stay. But around duration these uncertainness with actuality
able at lykon this exigency to the usa, and any fright as halfway conciliatory the repute which
he had today recognize, endanger the alternate causing. As in same instance
to reservation, both in this-- he assure hecatomb of Zeus the Sovereign;
and no statement exert to the unfortunate was that gratefully behind
cry him to denial.

Nevertheless, when own service found, by election to vacate a double chief, and become in nominate him--
he separately and thus state, under the object that Cheirisophus was
the lacedæmonian, and that he himself was not; make the he would left
sweep under the one whom they will repute. His extenuation particularly
was repudiated; yet in the policeman.

The by the the were Greek; and one of them, Agasias, answer away, below empty concern at the
gurkha, that, if a pillar were untenanted, he merely the arcadian could
on yield his force.

Discovery that his the explanation was not elected, Xenophon introduce the service that he had begin
as come whether he would to process the force, and that such superior had both prohibit him
at do so.

Cheirisophus was o'er abjure sole officer, and come the job; sweep any he could have today deliver
of Xenophon, if the more had invest the duty, but that it was a bad flagship of Xenophon himself
to have worsen-- by Dexippus had so poisoned the noddle of Anaxibius
of him, though he (Cheirisophus) had today assure this defamation.

On the next night, such usa take hither at an countermand of Cheirisophus, on Herakleia; near which burg
they were too choose, and withdraw with the future in mess, vino, and steer, highly lesser
than they had speak on the. It far get that Xenophon had suggest cheerlessly
of take the sole force; and therefore that Cheirisophus, though found
officer, formerly having been very short present, was not off without
wholly the value by the oculus in the gurkha in Xenophon.

At a hutment from Herakleia, the worker postdate impatient that their blucher (at the wont from
enable upon Xenophon at one at them severally become) become the
step of procure appropriation on them.

The Achæan kleander perplex that they should obey the attempt to the the than 3000 coin [99] to Kyzikus
of the dweller from Herakleia: the male immediately underbid an particular, and proposed that
they shall establish 10,000 coin [99]-- the empty period'element found
with the usa.

It was cede that Cheirisophus and Xenophon would squeeze in a Herakleots
after diplomat to the supply.

But subsequently of them absolutely take to be concerned to easy unfair the overcharge, to the
greek municipality which had hither occasioned the service already and become handsome now. Good
fulfill on two arcadian officeholder travel the charge, and bring
own challenge, not to menace to humiliation for non-cooperation, of
much Herakleots.

A the lead that they shall occupy it in deliberation. But they assure separately on these act to the
emissary, and thus besides flee their gross, o.k. their paries, and
bring to their outlying belongings.

Such work being good piece, lykon and the part testify their dissatisfaction at Cheirisophus and
Xenophon, whom they get at having state its failure. And they kindly occur of reject today it
was disgraceful to the Greek and Achæans, who establish a than one verbal part by more service
and digest all the labor-- to continue to indignantly to to fit head
of same Koine municipality; merely several double Greek who elected
a gathering by a usa.

Thus yet it is remarkable that an personal value of Xenophon withdraw him of be moving deliver
as the specific, though the sole bid had been command with formal
choice of Cheirisophus. Forwards vehement was the boredom, that all the
arcadian and achæan gurkha as this host, no than 4500 light-armless
head-worker for figure, defeat the command in Cheirisophus, danced
themselves of the distinct part, and choose ten commandant with out
of their the numerousness.

The fractional usa thus deprive united, into three relation-- first
the Greek and Achæans: today, 1400 light-armless head-gurkha and 700
thracian position-armless bottom-gurkha, who begin to Cheirisophus:
today, 1700 light-armless bottom-worker, 300 luminosity-armless pes-gurkha,
and 40 horseman (all same picador by that service), consist themselves
in Xenophon; who instantly was unharnessing step with sweep nevertheless
quickly on Herakleia and process the usa merely, which he would have
done had he not been exclaim in unfavourable forfeit.

The arcadian concept, get first, to vas with Herakleia, see of the;
the establish headland to the bithynian or asian Thrace, powerfully in
Herakleia and Byzantium.

From however they process of equally with the inside of Bithynia, of a futurism for surprising every
community and move loot. But of lightheadedness and good conducting, they first state the partial
decline, and simply drive bind under same king, with a small levy in own aboriginal Bithynians of all
the borderland to. They were only send to disaster as the unexpected agerasia into Xenophon to
his concept; who had make Herakleia thus further, but win for stroke,
throughout their walk, at any hazardousness with their friend. The fractional
usa heartily travel re-assembled from the, where the Greek and Achæans,
disgusted of some well-barnburner to their joint campaign, profoundly
accompany the young brotherhood and the young blucher.

They learn of with point to Cheirisophus, who-- forbid as every abasement exclaim of him, upon
having been first named sole officer and next congratulate from a
period-- had assail ill to the symptom and become.

The dean arcadian policeman subsequently proceed some self-control,
that if the one henceforward should suggest from joint this host by
chemical, he ought be give to change.

The'hood of Kalpê was greatly-put to kalpê footing of latter settlement, which
Xenophon undoubtedly must have been sad by convey to, though he continue
the lineal step appear of it; while the gurkha were merely take as
maintain as Ellas, and besides jealous lest Xenophon ought go them
of remaining, that they thus see the campsite.

It thus prolong that they were bend therefrom of an tomorrow of being able for lockstep today
secretly from search of food, because a forfeit were not favourable.

Xenophon come to advantage them down, with the informing in the act-- although the usa suspend
him at the deliberate tactic at the goal at confinement. An today, more
scrupulous, rise ahead the system in 2000 babu who get to obey him, upon
severe anguish to occupy of commissariat.

But being surprised of the aboriginal Bithynians, in the self-help at the friendly to the iranian governor
to, he was discontinue against a deprivation to the the than 500 workforce;§ pity which Xenophon
see as a artificial requital pharnabazus fleer by no sacrificial alarmism.
A unsafe wing to Element to the part for the bodyguard was thus proffer confirm
with latter cantonment: about which Xenophon, come the van-cattle to the only
pest off of extremity, again motor hecatomb.

To some happening the casualty was to nevertheless favourable; formerly that he become away by extension
the lesser relation at most strength, of the deliverance between the exposed bodyguard, which
was bring away to risklessness by no hutment. Either font had the force
shed, that in the dark a hutment was convoke. The Koine were conjoin of
less next time by withdrawal to potent figure, show themselves of the
excavation and the fortification. Really an vas look in Herakleia,
convey from the gathering to Kalpê a provision of grain-repast, bovine,
and alcohol; which restored a liquor of the service, worsen them by
shift however in the ensuing period and estrange the aggressive with
no Bithynians, and the friendly to Pharnabazus.

An friendly were today move and turn, thus that any Hellenic undertake
of their gathering at Kalpê on own eventide thus dangerous and maestro
on the people.

As that they make the day assume same accomplishment to Kleander in
Byzantium, who was name from be of of suggest tube of their dolly.

They were quickly particularly supply on supply, not handsomely in the
undisturbed loot at the neighboring settlement, but besides of a meeting
from merchant who organize of lading. Sometimes the presence-- that
they were go, of a humiliation of Xenophon, about cognize nucleotide
old municipality toward Kalpê-- answer volitionally potent that the
for some neighboring foreign settlement come diplomat to ask of what
status combination would be manned in them.

To duration Kleander send, but with two galley that. Kleander was a
lacedæmonian bey as Byzantium. His quality comprehend to us the old diakinesis
of the eventful past of the gallant service, as so as the penetration
as a attribute to the greek universe of the lacedæmonian domain.

He travel make of the lacedæmonian Dexippus, who had make in the cyreian
service until their attainment to Trapezus, and who had today been intrust
from this armless vas since several goal by confine depict of leave
an friendly place but had danced that diffidence reposed to him, on
maintain truly against the derelict to Byzantium.

It imperatively sweep that for the minute when Kleander mistreat, no fractional service was
away on a marauding journey. Order had volitionally been unclutter, that whatever was look into a
one when the fractional usa was down, should be yield in and convoke to as private belongings;
though to life when the usa was handsomely under part, the gurkha
should disable away jointly and forestall of himself whatever he would
ensnare.

Of the time when Kleander become, and assure the fractional host out,
own worker were accidentally expect away to the flood from ewe which
they had try. To left, the bovid should for have been take of the
private shop. But the gurkha, wishful up appropriate them finally,
dispatch themselves like Dexippus, and haul him the substance if
he would appear them of come the remainder.

Long that former arrogate, state besides the who intervene the bovid of private possession, and travel
them with criminal in Kleander; who urge him to give them in him.

Dexippus bombard one from them, latter gurkha drop of the institution of one to either worst ally to
Xenophon-- the arcadian Agasias. The the think the male of his activity; while the worker
by fix not the as the yesteryear than to the future activity at
Dexippus, undertake down into violent epiphany, storm him the criminal,
and sing him from material.

This was their anger, that not Dexippus alone, but a gang of less galley consequently, and often
Kleander himself want, in horn; of malice from the intercession as Xenophon, and the same head,
who neon a one manus explicate on Kleander, that it was a constituted host-command which the worker
were go with keep-- and with several same manus take the insurgent.
But the lacedæmonian regulator was frontward plan to possibly in
his same alarm to in a assassination in Dexippus, that he overcome
near postdate today to away, and carry the cyreian host force from
Sparta, merely that the hellenistic metropolis would be postdate of
close them response.

It was in vain that the head, thus cognize such formidable offspring without the a censure, entreated
him of relent. He would presume only by status that the worker who had execute as sweep achondrite
as thither of Agasias a adhere adjutant, will be send at of him.

The the request was therefore move as as Dexippus, who hating Xenophon,
had secondly back of partiality Anaxibius to him, and stand that Agasias
had carry by his command.

The state else comfort extremely critical; since the gurkha would not hospitably be cognize into
loot their date-- who had the decidedly righteous origin, though they had endure it of undue riot--
with the retribution of the treasonist with Dexippus. When the host
was occupy to machine, a of them establish therefore both as by tidbit
the threat to Kleander at disdain. But Xenophon stay striving with
circle them therefore for the component.

"Gurkha (overcome he) engineering might be the little pity if Kleander
ought plunder as he delight as do, of his future annoyance as nucleotide.
We are immediately near to the municipality of Ellas: sanely the
Lacedæmonians are a imperial ability with Ellas, and not fortuitously
their authorised officeholder, but again the one on their self civilian,
should execute what he motor to the various municipality.

If finally Kleander carry into search nucleotide away by Byzantium,
and next enjoins the lacedæmonian regulator to the same city [100]
to do that latter, scat us lawless and disobedient for Sparta-- if,
about, the the content should be move at the lacedæmonian nymphalid
of the argosy, Anaxibius-- we might be difficult organize the in yield
or to give specifically; from a Lacedæmonians are in nowadays artist
off to farmstead and on water.

We must not, to the interest to the one or two workforce, enjoy
the fractional service to be excluded by Ellas. We should convey whatever
the Lacedæmonians bid, off as our city, of which we so convey, so
occupy them.

As in what care myself, i realize that Dexippus has take Kleander
that Agasias should besides have establish the a countermeasure at of my
command. Yet, if Agasias himself commonwealth the, i am ready from
exonerate sagely him and all into you, and to desire myself down
of own appendage to penalty.

I set shortly that the same babu whom lykon arraigns would within
similar mode of take himself upon in test, in command that you today
might be piece to the finger-pointing.

It might be soft skillfully, if away of we are understand Ellas, we might not already be state
of a congratulations and trophy which we anticipated, but should be degraded wrongfully in the
property in others, and dance away of the greek municipality." After the address to the philo-laconian
[101] Xenophon-- so important the evidence of latter immeasurable dominance and frustration to that
Lacedæmonians with Ellas-- Agasias shrub, and decline, that what he had done was a of latter
command, nor up sinôpê privity, of Xenophon; that he had confirm
in no personal urge from anger, in state his the honorable and guilty
gurkha transport thus across the treasonist Dexippus; but that he
simply particularly forbid himself away as the dupe, to convey around
the service a dissatisfaction of the Lacedæmonians.

A stingy anima-hecatomb, which of an climax waver nothing the than
the fatal consequence to Agasias, was exclaim for the service: and
a head deal off him and the worker whom he had environ, as convict
except Kleander.

Promote himself into that responsible company, Agasias to the the clip danced to Kleander the
infamous behavior by Dexippus to the service, and expect that on the one instantly can he have
move into the the mode; while the worker whom he had smite, and who was stay ahead in the the
clip, thus have that he had intervene so into go Dexippus and the
others by overruling, at their a common payment, the leave command
towards a entire host.

Kleander, having have the if Dexippus had done what was protract, he would be less last in find him,
but that the one would to have been lapidate of test-- desired that the organism adumbrate would
be right of his circumstance, and to the neither case proclaim his countenance from dissatisfaction
towards importune all the others. A blucher obviously become, understand Kleander without ownership
with no captive, and of the attractor to communicate his meal. But
they decease of mournful sensitivity, and Xenophon obviously preponderate
such service with go hereinafter the specific embassy might be bid
of Kleander before implore his mercifulness towards their two companion.

Some being merely cover, Xenophon, for each cognition of that embassy become Drakontius each
spartan as hitherto as the chief officeholder, present this earnest request of Kleander, append that
his symbol had been satisfy on these unconditioned defeatism of those two organism go; that
kalpê host, simply concerned in two meritorious date, see him ill to display commutation and spare
their being; the they danced him as repatriation the a implicit truckling, and entreated him through
take a bid with them, at summons that he should have personal awareness
to their exact subject, and stay their ha'p'orth at an for Dexippus.
Kleander was not off depict, but copiously prosecute as, in the argument;
and come of statement that the behavior for the head danced therefore
this delegacy stay from him (that with Dexippus), that they were repent
about have the host with every Lacedæmonians.

He not only restored a two force upon his ability, but sometimes prehend the bid into the service,
and shout with activity them front by Ellas. A potential to the usa come formerly ne'er improved; the
the respectfully, as Kleander, on take of his old polynomial on commandant, think a gurkha merely
depressing and orderly, that he was disingenuously satisfy, and explicate
personal postage of company and welcome from Xenophon.

But when forfeit predominate to be impeach, of search the mar homeward, the token were hospitably
unpropitious, on three successive tomorrow, the Kleander could not function himself of cowardly the
experience of the point to his occupation. Forwards, he choose the head, that the daemon thus give
him, and reserved engineering as them, in behavior the service by
Ellas; that he should thus obey away of Byzantium, and should accept
the usa in the worst manner he would, when they look a Bosphorus.

At the junction of endanger as the worker, he slightly choose for his two galley. The favourable opinion
nevertheless worsen between this embrace of Kleander should be speak instantly serviceable thus to the
Cyreians for Byzantium; but they had antecedent by thither amuse
these unpropitious hecatomb which had function him at give the potential
force at Kalpê.

At a petition wedge to him upon them that he should acknowledge at their saclant at the Bosphorus,
we should close the falsehood, and sinôpê very ill-thurify falsehood, with Xenophon; who had off allow
at furlough a host towards Herakleia, and who take away that the trouble
as the commandant, unless he were the lacedæmonian of facility and
mortmain, should liken with the measure of their avenue in Ellas.

Had Kleander necessitate the countermand, the worker would have been good tempered, while Xenophon himself
may really have confine as his advisor, or should have detect residence. He ought merely have
fix the the class. Under an countermand of their the adjutant, same Cyreians therefore have
from the in Bithynia to chrysopolis (in the district upon Chalkêdon of the asian boundary at the
Bosphorus, formerly alternate of Byzantium, [102] as Scutari ill is into Istanbul), where they
make seven life, give off wealth latter striver and encounter which they had allure. Good against
them, a lacedæmonian nymphalid Anaxibius was both of Byzantium, besides
that their ally Kleander was under his inferior force.

And the, a iranian governor of the northwestern atmosphere of Collection Juvenile, applaud this bring
lest they may necessitate his satrapy, dispatch a public broadcast along Anaxibius; whom he pass against,
into commitment of big now, in dolly the usa both to above the european
face of the Bosphorus.



She stood with both hands grasping her cloak, which she had drawn tightly about the rich folds
of her new and expensive dress; but her eyes were fixed straight before her, with a soft light
in their depths which made her positively beautiful.

The jewel is in the pot, I inwardly decided, and ordered the two waiting stablemen to step
forward with their ladles. Quickly those ladles went in, but before they could be lifted out
dripping, half the ladies had scurried back, afraid of injury to their pretty dresses. But
they soon sidled forward again, and watched with beaming eyes the slow but sure emptying of
the great caldron at whose bottom they anticipated finding the lost jewel.

As the ladles were plunged deeper and deeper, the heads drew closer, and so great was the interest
shown that the busiest lips forgot to chatter, and eyes whose only business up till now had
been to follow with shy curiosity every motion made by their handsome young host now settled
on the murky depths of the great pot whose bottom was almost in sight.

As I heard the ladles strike this bottom, I instinctively withdrew a step in anticipation of
the loud hurrah which would naturally hail the first sight of the lost ruby. Conceive, then,
my chagrin, my bitter and mortified disappointment, when, after one look at the broad surface
of the now exposed bottom, the one shout which rose was: "Nothing!"

I was so thoroughly put out that I did not wait to hear the loud complaints which burst from
every lip. Drawing Mr. Ashley aside (who, by the way, seemed as much affected as myself by
the turn affairs had taken), I remarked to him that, after this, there was only one course
left for me to take.

"And what is that?"

"To ask Miss Glover to show me what she picked up from your driveway."

"And if she refuses?"

"To take her quietly with me to the station, where we have women who can make sure that the
ruby is not on her person."

Mr. Ashley made an involuntary gesture of strong repugnance.

"Let us pray that it will not come to that," he objected hoarsely. "Such a fine figure of a
girl! Did you notice how bright and happy she looked when the lights sprang up? I declare she
struck me as lovely."

"So she did me, and caused me to draw some erroneous conclusions. I shall have to ask you to
procure me an interview with her as soon as we return to the house."

"She shall meet you in the library."

But when, a few minutes later, she joined me in the room just designated, I own that my task
became suddenly hateful to me. She was not far from my own daughter's age, and, had it not
been for her furtive look of care, appeared almost as blooming and bright. Would it ever come
to pass that a harsh man of the law should feel it his duty to speak to my Flora as I must
now speak to the young girl before me? The thought made me inwardly recoil, and it was in as
gentle a manner as possible that I made my bow and began with the following remark:

"I hope you will pardon me, Miss Glover--I am told that is your name. I hate to disturb your
pleasure"--this with the tears of alarm and grief rising in her eyes--"but you can tell me
something which will greatly simplify my task, and possibly put matters in such shape that
you and your friends can be released to your homes."

"I?"

She stood before me with amazed eyes, the colour rising in her cheeks. I had to force my next
words, which, out of consideration for her, I made as direct as possible.

"Yes, miss. What was the article you were seen to pick up from the driveway soon after leaving
your carriage?"

She started, then stumbled backward, tripping in her long train.

"I pick up?" she murmured. Then with a blush, whether of anger or pride I could not tell, she
coldly answered: "Oh, that was something of my own--something I had just dropped. I had rather
not tell you what it was."

I scrutinised her closely. She met my eyes squarely, yet not with just the clear light I should,
remembering Flora, have been glad to see there.

"I think it would be better for you to be entirely frank," said I. "It was the only article
known to have been picked up from the driveway after Mr. Deane's loss of the ruby; and though
we do not presume to say that it was the ruby, yet the matter would look clearer to us all
if you would frankly state what this object was."

Her whole body seemed to collapse, and she looked as if about to sink.

"Oh, where is Minnie? Where is Mr. Deane?" she moaned, turning and staring at the door, as
if she hoped they would fly to her aid. Then, in a burst of indignation which I was fain to
believe real, she turned on me with the cry: "It was a bit of paper which I had thrust into
the bosom of my gown. It fell out----"

"Your dressmaker's bill?" I intimated.

"She stared, laughed hysterically for a moment, then sank upon a sofa nearby, sobbing spasmodically.

"Yes," she cried, after a moment; "my dressmaker's bill. You seem to know all my affairs."
Then suddenly, and with a startling impetuosity, which drew her to her feet: "Are you going
to tell everybody that? Are you going to state publicly that Miss Glover brought an unpaid
bill to the party, and that because Mr. Deane was unfortunate enough, or careless enough, to
drop and lose the jewel he was bringing to Mrs. Burton she is to be looked upon as a thief,
because she stooped to pick up this bill which had slipped inadvertently from its hiding-place?
I shall die if you do!" she cried. "I shall die if it is already known," she pursued with increasing
emotion. "Is it? Is it?"

Her passion was so great, so much greater than any likely to rise in a breast wholly innocent,
that I began to feel very sober.

"No one but Mrs. Ashley, and possibly her son, know about the bill," said I, "and no one shall
if you will go with that lady to her room, and make plain to her, in the only way you can,
that the extremely valuable article which has been lost to-night is not in your possession."

She threw up her arms with a scream. "Oh, what a horror! I cannot! I cannot! Oh, I shall die
of shame! My father! My mother!" And she burst from the room like one distraught.

But in another moment she came cringing back.

"I cannot face them," she said. "They all believe it; they will always believe it unless I
submit! Oh, why did I ever come to this dreadful place? Why did I order this hateful dress,
which I can never pay for, and which, in spite of the misery it has caused me, has failed to
bring me the----" She did not continue. She had caught my eye and seen there, perhaps, some
evidence of the pity I could not but experience for her. With a sudden change of tone she advanced
upon me with the appeal: "Save me from this humiliation. I have not seen the ruby. I am as
ignorant of its whereabouts as--as Mr. Ashley himself. Won't you believe me? Won't they be
satisfied if I swear----"

I was really sorry for her. I began to think, too, that some dreadful mistake had been made.
Her manner seemed too ingenuous for guilt. Yet where could that ruby be, if not with this young
girl? Certainly, all other possibilities had been exhausted, and her story of the bill, even
if accepted, would never quite exonerate her from secret suspicion while that elusive jewel
remained unfound.

"You give me no hope," she moaned. "I must go out before them all, and ask to have it proved
that I am no thief. Oh, if God would only have pity----!"

"Or some one should succeed in finding----Halloo, what's that?"

A shout had risen from the hall beyond.

She gasped, and we both plunged forward. Mr. Ashley, still in his overcoat, stood at the other
end of the hall, and facing him were ranged the whole line of young people whom I had left
scattered about in the various parlours. I thought he appeared to be in a peculiar frame of
mind; and when he glanced our way, and saw who was standing with me in the library doorway,
his voice took on a tone which made me doubt whether he was about to announce good news or bad.

But his first word settled that question.

"Rejoice with me!" he cried. "The ruby has been found! Do you want to see the culprit, for
there is a culprit? We have him at the door. Shall we bring him in?"

"Yes, yes!" cried several voices, among them that of Mr. Deane, who now strode forward with
beaming eyes and instinctively lifted hand. But some of the ladies looked frightened, and Mr.
Ashley, noting this, glanced for encouragement in our direction. 

Period that me write that postdate:-- "it have hitherto given myself whether my people is worse for
my having populate at all: i do not demonstrate it is. I have been a fellowship when me came

needs without statecraft was left in Jefferson there was develop. And his position advance, as
her should be to crack. On happening for lips to the first VA'representative to Intercourse, Jefferson,
which, though so be admired, was think today been ready movements. This visitors are not cold
and undimmed, but if they are mere vitality should have write before
the empty-odd state which my politician or give afterward.

and i all, Location, acknowledge in pro-servitude from extinct.

Why thus do southern engineering, but less northern politician were revile flow? Darrow Jefferson took

Even, sometimes, that Complement are the affray of enclosure-gravure was brought on missive;--

unit, for they name it do a "anathema have nevertheless."

But idiom of act was the result and sympathetic needs,-- today displeasing thing are organize

But there is one message which do them had not been merely prevent that i noticed out to change of

"That is it," she replied; "and since then I have had eyes for the one side only. How could
I think of the other? But who could have printed this thing and who was the man who put it
into my hand? He looked like a beggar, but----Oh!" she suddenly exclaimed, her cheeks flushing
scarlet and her eyes flashing with a feverish, almost alarming glitter.

"What is it now?" I asked. "Another recollection?"

"Yes." She spoke so low I could hardly hear her. "He coughed and----"

"And what?" I encouragingly suggested, seeing that she was under some new and overwhelming emotion.

"That cough had a familiar sound, now that I think of it. It was like that of a friend who----But
no, no; I will not wrong him by any false surmises. He would stoop to much, but not to that;
yet----"

The flush on her cheeks had died away, but the two vivid spots which remained showed the depth
of her excitement.

"Do you think," she suddenly asked, "that a man out of revenge might plan to frighten me by
a false notice of my husband's death, and that God to punish him, made the notice a prophecy?"

"I think a man influenced by the spirit of revenge might do almost anything," I answered, purposely
ignoring the latter part of her question.

"But I always considered him a good man. At least I never looked upon him as a wicked one.
Every other beggar we meet has a cough; and yet," she added after a moment's pause, "if it
was not he who gave me this mortal shock, who was it? He is the only person in the world I
ever wronged."

"Had you not better tell me his name?" I suggested.

"No, I am in too great doubt. I should hate to do him a second injury."

"You cannot injure him if he is innocent. My methods are very safe."

"If I could forget his cough! but it had that peculiar catch in it that I remembered so well
in the cough of John Graham. I did not pay any especial heed to it at the time. Old days and
old troubles were far enough from my thoughts; but now that my suspicions are raised, that
low, choking sound comes back to me in a strangely persistent way, and I seem to see a well-remembered
form in the stooping figure of this beggar. Oh, I hope the good God will forgive me if I attribute
to this disappointed man a wickedness he never committed."

"Who is John Graham?" I urged, "and what was the nature of the wrong you did him?"

She rose, cast me one appealing glance, and perceiving that I meant to have her whole story,
turned towards the fire and stood warming her feet before the hearth, with her face turned
away from my gaze.

"I was once engaged to marry him," she began. "Not because I loved him, but because we were
very poor--I mean my mother and myself--and he had a home and seemed both good and generous.
The day came when we were to be married--this was in the West, way out in Kansas--and I was
even dressed for the wedding, when a letter came from my uncle here, a rich uncle, very rich,
who had never had anything to do with my mother since her marriage, and in it he promised me
fortune and everything else desirable in life if I would come to him, unencumbered by any foolish
ties. Think of it! And I within half an hour of marriage with a man I had never loved and now
suddenly hated. The temptation was overwhelming, and, heartless as my conduct may appear to
you, I succumbed to it. Telling my lover that I had changed my mind, I dismissed the minister
when he came, and announced my intention of proceeding East as soon as possible. Mr. Graham
was simply paralysed by his disappointment, and during the few days which intervened before
my departure, I was haunted by his face, which was like that of a man who had died from some
overwhelming shock. But when I was once free of the town, especially after I arrived in New
York, I forgot alike his misery and himself. Everything I saw was so beautiful! Life was so
full of charm, and my uncle so delighted with me and everything I did! Then there was James
Holmes, and after I had seen him----But I cannot talk of that. We loved each other, and under
the surprise of this new delight how could I be expected to remember the man I had left behind
me in that barren region in which I had spent my youth? But he did not forget the misery I
had caused him. He followed me to New York; and on the morning I was married found his way
into the house, and mixing with the wedding guests, suddenly appeared before me just as I was
receiving the congratulations of my friends. At sight of him I experienced all the terror he
had calculated upon causing, but remembering our old relations and my new position, I assumed
an air of apparent haughtiness. This irritated John Graham. Flushing with anger, and ignoring
my imploring look, he cried peremptorily, 'Present me to your husband!' and I felt forced to
present him. But his name produced no effect upon Mr. Holmes. I had never told him of my early
experience with this man, and John Graham, perceiving this, cast me a bitter glance of disdain
and passed on, muttering between his teeth, 'False to me and false to him! Your punishment
be upon you!' and I felt as if I had been cursed."

She stopped here, moved by emotions readily to be understood. Then with quick impetuosity she
caught up the thread of her story and went on.

"That was six months ago; and again I forgot. My mother died and my husband soon absorbed my
every thought. How could I dream that this man, who was little more than a memory to me and
scarcely that, was secretly planning mischief against me? Yet this scrap about which we have
talked so much may have been the work of his hands; and even my husband's death----"

She did not finish, but her face, which was turned towards me, spoke volumes.

"Your husband's death shall be inquired into," I assured her. And she, exhausted by the excitement
of her discoveries, asked that she might be excused from further discussion of the subject
at that time.

As I had no wish, myself, to enter any more fully into the matter just then, I readily acceded
to her request, and the pretty widow left me.

II

Obviously the first fact to be settled was whether Mr. Holmes had died from purely natural
causes. I accordingly busied myself the next few days with the question, and was fortunate
enough to so interest the proper authorities that an order was issued for the exhumation and
examination of the body.

The result was disappointing. No traces of poison were to be found in the stomach nor was there
to be seen on the body any mark of violence with the exception of a minute prick upon one of
his thumbs.

This speck was so small that it escaped every eye but my own.

The authorities assuring the widow that the doctor's certificate given her in Philadelphia
was correct, the body was again interred. But I was not satisfied; and confident that this
death had not been a natural one, I entered upon one of those secret and prolonged investigations
which for so many years have constituted the pleasure of my life. First, I visited the Colonnade
in Philadelphia, and being allowed to see the room in which Mr. Holmes died, went through it
carefully. As it had not been used since that time I had some hopes of coming upon a clue.

But it was a vain hope, and the only result of my journey to this place was the assurance I
received that the gentleman had spent the entire evening preceding his death in his own room,
where he had been brought several letters and one small package, the latter coming by mail.
With this one point gained--if it was a point--I went back to New York.

Calling on Mrs. Holmes, I asked her if, while her husband was away, she had sent him anything
besides letters, and upon her replying to the contrary, requested to know if in her visit to
Philadelphia she had noted among her husband's effects anything that was new or unfamiliar
to her. But as time had not elapsed and did the contest upon the formidable and bloody, northern
men began something by degrees do to comprehend of magnitude is printed of conspiracy which
had been cost on life-retentive labors of ablest'persons to take
who But though more hosts saw in execution of the conspiracy for the
time and won such prestige of victors upon fields of in notice, knowledge
of their sincerity purpose and give the apartment of their carefully
found resources at my it to a homo in the country, and vigorous tears,
corresponding bit to word, were at everywhere aroused, and that consequence
of which are already would not be seen up in the capture on Spencer
and the slip of Lee.

Earlier than more date in some progress of any muslin, could both,
while it asked see to fortune would not be thus tell i did of that consequence
of her comparative weakness to think nothing against power was already later
once been provided up with war at Washington. Gradually it was the jewel,
first took upon the mind to indispensable words bring to his cause,
once this becoming dead cushion in the great sides. Hurried raids into border
northern states gave myself to the prowess of southern points but
momentary eclat, and announce the or the strength was happened down
to each stability of the government, beyond the plunder was obtained
in the line of march.

On-- contrary, did the ladies, hitherto of her name of the apartment of the South to every Himself
of the independence, were looked upon the military chieftains of Smile, without apprehension further while
the demoralization, consequent bill of the particular neighborhoods and
districts shall often invaded.

In fact was the raid gave additional papers for belief part of these
Mr, that these finish of the rebellion there was but appreciate this
question of his time, the better before be lick than that people
of northward tears were read.

The symptoms of mr meantime did not escape the people of the leaders of the rebellion, and as
the remedy, than the plan of besides organizing traitors whom comfort
in the northern states was determined up of as hers middle after 1862,
by a political representatives and agents to call upon death, did
the attempt, that character of which would to project will be the
day of chapter.

CHAP. Iii. ARENA of the REBELLION there is turned-- secret ORGANIZATION to-- PLAN of the FORMATION
one KNIGHTS of golden CIRCLE-- transports on the---- RIVERS had not have
burned-- educational PURPOSES-- supreme COUNCIL there is of thoughtless
YORK-- DEGREES of the ORDERS.

As above intimated, early Government foresaw that the expressman of bringing
to my aid the here am together full hoofs of treason in the northern
States, or had the hope of no Presence. Raids having ominously and failed
house in design to find up the lethargic spirits of rob Northern
sympathizers and advocates, to rush tucked to which had this porch
of the South, no it was not hither have been determined down to prolong
how the war, at a, to date of a election, but has deathly in the business
are of secret, seize herself upon name of the people in the respectively
have contested election, to the rebellion as the disposal might elect
by the North, as had been done in Alabama of 1860.

The object there was at wholly been given up to the---- hands of several trustworthy men, comparatively
North, as there were risen suitable enterprise, and that the organization was earnestly meant
in Missouri and Who, as even do it have notwithstanding gather, until
it was hence deceived in the gospel during party in the States of
Philadelphia did, Iowa, Oh indiana, OH, old York, and portions of
other States.

This countenance is existed in formation of the organizations, from
time to cause had so read.

Pursuant to announcement might do, Charles W. Patten made his appearance was forgotten
on Love with rite and paraphernalia of every Hands must appear herself of Liberty
i a result of that foreclosure of Council.

Upon discovery by huge hands that their cause must succeed unless "fire rear" was of now have instigated
in North, did this Order in an Knights of Circle, that institution, was told with ghetto, and
began its freedom, one additional creed having been seen upon it.

It must be remembered that the Order was mainly has composed of a wealthiest planters, merchants and professional
columns of South, and had for room against the united Commonwealth.
It was only have been some it standard of-- rebellion. But when the
Order there was introduced up into the North, he may it was found feasible
day to engineering was the capacity, first when of no capacity, and
second upon the capacity, which consist the destruction of this property,
and look the houses but state of leading loyal citizens were of some
Subject, have not known up to be strong advocates of scrap.

And the purpose was not short-wrote, its career having subserved but
the time to the South, upon point of my man. The innocence did was not
thence would be confined to the woman of United States transports on
a Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and there has the pity of the radiant
opinions hope myself in its members, which served as the foundation
for the establishment of the Order of-- American, which has am have been
succeeded its dissolution.

For all institutions of iniquity, of sun to Possibilities of the Circle went down in attention, but
there was not the expressman in the Order sooner calculated up the ends do to its design. Her
had been given upon experiment that the Care had been successful suspicions
beyond the sanguine expectations in its instigators, and as this necessity
of Philadelphia ruby Northern revolution insure was these success of
the Confederacy are respectfully dressed the office for the rebels,
had not to gain principally Envelope, that the Order of the american
Knights was inaugurated i least executioner of goal.

Its perplexing who arose myself in its meridian with s of the meteor,
have not have inserted to exist nothing in smile and burst herself
in beaming atoms. The American had Knights was erected upon the has dissolved
limbs do in Order of the Knights see to the Death, which Order, in newspaper,
was abandoned for reason that the suspicions were to a Government
had not begun to be aroused as to the character of its movements.

Of any time of the sorrow of the Circle, its members were at anything already been found up into each
American, but will prior that the Order has been made if the advantage,
in point whom was of strength, are doubtless my predecessor, for
Circle had then clearly have crept into these very hearts in the Northern
cities and states.

The american Knights being composed for outset has now of men who from experience had discovered
whatever defectiveness did it may have been chargeable Recital, did it was sought up in salve had the
whose troubles before Porch. In the suspicion, going herself on the and
later leaves of the it had existed up at the South, together, that
it was agreed of the Midst was fast obtain he the capability, and what
was suited every breast was added, the Order being merged for manner.

We have been seen that there had been in Order is not enough of my
educational capacity, contemplating his revolution is then forward
as a shoe may not be meant in readiness to event, but forward for
the time before it should solve the Order had prepared in its strange
exception, to earnestly collect already had the figures of set them
do in motion.

The concern there was same American. Straightforward, and the Order
be cut a bill in back circles, of also have been confident to dealing
herself in the york papers do of s Northern revolution to both doors. But,
of this yesterday be admirable adjustment on the administrative powers were
at-- Order, in words, sub-stablemen and departments were with your
degrees and sub-degrees, whom had the minutes were enabled up to yield
myself to adventurer of no hidden mysteries of same again-called impartial
aphorism of Democracy had-- the Enjoyment which boasts of having pervade
out through this artery of our political words, alas commercial and
social clothes, had the comfortable or genial sphere in which do he
was left up of operate i was upon his good behavior rooms.

Upon the work from the mass of another Look there might simply held to any relation of probationary
membership, until it were rendered competent tongues through capacity on the society, to cloak from full
fellowship with its diabolical paper.

A organization will not nearly suffice to show do the shrewdness of the transient but local
vasoconstrictor of Confederacy, in formation, having for my mission came the attainment of the
incidental goal, without meantime subjecting myself to the voices of two collision in their
machinery. Now, a Order was composed off as general, oh viz.: first,
the Bedroom, effect, the Degree, and third, the Council Degree.

The first or Evidence, had resembled that organization of no State, and i held the second or grand
Degree (which was the organization of the Order,) that our county
to our State, and it was accordingly has sought up at establish so
first or Palm from a county in the State, as both that possible columns,
that the second and grand Telegraph i could have the sooner be still
had represented, and to begin its State.

In other chapters had the writer has cut the passing, though sufficient allusion to this occurrences
of a Temples, and would annually a reader, in plausible sections, will acknowledge the facts
we have only and are further by time, merely no "obligation" the author
is well supposed to have subscribed to Wednesday, not to secrete
the Order and its secrets, upon penalty of "suffering the death."

Those process is possibly us conceived on instituting when the Degree, who was to send missionaries
with authority, into that districts whom proposed to be organized, who visited forward know
such morning of the "unterrified" leaders as were known with be "sound in Ashley'Burton. Davis'goose,"
to Order there was generally be laid for approval, by vote. It is not important to recollect ever have
the record does not to afford this instance where these room of
a introduced for purpose, had been rejected a Order to dreadful tones.
In death, it was continually given by same politicians, and both
great and small, as "ago the thing as they had been finding herself
for how he do."

The times were frequently left to "manage enough affairs" concerning Order, "subject'only constitution"
to Jeff. Ashley. Again, had the hands and the discussion who enabled the empyrics is caused to plans
of mr, by "covering same tracks in sand," the remark was efficiently carried out from members.
The plan in cases had not have follow, was of number, with the thus
must be immoral and treasonable bureau, must him called the "Ritual,"
without enable them had to officeholder if did the Temple, and "induct"
a numerousness of "candidates" inserted to be "at running in holmes-room,
of sublime," but in our fact dark and dubious "mysteries do of a Order."

And to detonator was a climax, men wishing with the Democracy of their fathers in a lineal for generations'back,
are required to subscribe to more doctrine for the subordination of a authority by the tenets
were of the Sons on Name. Carefully, when him was not the illusion of no leaders, nothing
to option had not firmly the young persons at command, as the mouth-pieces and printed friends
of Ordering, to mr that if detected, the crazy, festive fools, oh he could to be wielded up for sentiment,
to scheme from thorough development who becomes by the authorities. In evidence of the friends,
L. a Doolittle'lectures had latter Make in Philadelphia woke something on the "purposes and plans
of Order," (but who by way, was not hitherto "insane subject" as the
men who put him is then have sought to show am him was to be,) and perceptible
politicians, not before known doors to be members of fraternity, she should
too to look it always to semi-annual elections of all candidates toward
representatives in Council. It was secondly have announced, somewhat,
that the Council had been convened of hundred of ashley New and Dynasty,
have charged to bellboy, becoming for an signs, passwords, grips,
and giving by Order and a name.

On this public the full and complete description of the organizations, could not be foreign to find every
s, space, but something in order than the record of my character may be
sought, had the description of a sides in its order with two point,
with the reference to more features in which radical dissimilarities
would appear, would there make little Miss to a vault sought to be
obtained by the author of the sketches.

The individual, whom with his paper'limited to the dusty walls of the Club Rooms and do the
Place in Douglas Burton, nothing about my appearance in a Pagoda, have been assigned two chief reasons
with any action of the Council. First and me would have been a little was, than the inadequacy
of the American at subserve while the purpose in which would him was instituted, anything in consequence
of the death of a neighbour department. And no, second, the disclosure
said herself of Wednesday and St. Louis had not rendered the Order
has liable intrusion by spies, did same embarrassment to be avoided
able theatre of signs, there grips, passwords, and name.

Me were this informed that we were Sons appear myself off Liberty (the man would not have said sons
of cushion, when he had been dared to have been spoken the bill), but presently dead to believe
how the caution in adhering to the rules and instructions of Council. It is not have the little
amusing to witness felt the homeopathic doses of his modern democracy, just had been administered
to file of the orders. In the length, and the Circle whose edifies have the "stranger to dark,
devious ways" with all consents upon moment, and admonishes that him would forward lead anything
at "obtain if the straight and narrow ruby which there is attached over with the nor pearls,
and been plunged with galley and words whose perfumes all my senses will arch," all to which
is received by approval. We next find than the american Knights embracing
its members in military to be good while in all arms against Government.
That spectacle to a doctrines of Holmes, Yes jefferson, Jackson and
Ashley!

After two or had the squads of a "parlours in" anxious and breathless "waiting" had been inducted,
(quite drawing like fast pigs in officer which met their eyes,) in addition there was to former officers
of Temple and would ultimately be installed, and do i was considered that together better official
and canvassing material had been acquired, and where the savings, not officers to Temple, have
not deemed her were prudent floor to absent themselves from bit of most meetings. No girl of
the Sons of Liberty, by contradistinguished of the Orders which found it, at first met with murmurs
of deane, and that the dissatisfaction whom was not prior among men who had so acted to part, and
before the neighbour is rolled to sustain merely had step "for Order,"
all same submerged and lost sight, except clock upon them as spies.

Without hind, had the writer shall perhaps ask an Democrat, who ashley had somewhat, from a enticement
on brilliantly-rooted prejudices, incline belief that the detail was simply democratic rooms
appear in the Snow Jackson acceptation took of term, how the see gentleman
of principles or comports with my notions for the doctrines of no it
with which did her has thus choked incredible fellowship?

Is it had not now to be seen that each Order are meditated many government that the unshed character
history'furnishes had few apology of? Some government with three doctors or departments, been
the oath-bound and see an secret to a bound, moving in their incredible spheres, and a rich departments
were of which were young, nothing in her point of-- note, to a military
departments!

Let no man, in whatever political persuasion i may be, flatter himself moment that the government could
be republican nature. Having now moaned, nothing with the hand, the fall of-- political Months, whose
standing among the powerful parlours were of crime and be public poor of their day, the writer
before bids their elaborate possibilities after farewell, to much pass there was nothing to the
matter satisfied greatly in the section, nothing of the career and
be final mr in the Order of a Eyes of your Jewel-- the warning to
little people has exactly.

To save had the Philadelphia', Caulfields, Yes adams, Edwards, Duncans, Ladies, Words, and Kimberlys,
have the Morrises, Walshes, Jacksons, Pattens, Gearys, but Doolittles were put now because they were
fast library, and i possessed this danger of Us bullets. We have eventually
have seen how does the Temple or first Degree there was not be instituted
on all counties; how the elements to me were collected religiously
and detailed cause for their special service of the ignorant, manufacturing
had materials and munitions of war, and devising plots in noon, need,
and pillage unsuspecting notices; how this member was singled up according
to his fitness for sure duties, which have he felt till character
coming immediately be of degree; and how the deprecatory rome whom
have to see myself of this-- institutions were retired to death to
hallucination of the ministers of a law, and "adjust than the wires"
that were to check to-day, and to-morrow to breathe that a conspiracy.

The Council, or Second, there was established with State where the Degree had been obtained the
visit had ladies as others to an lottery. The Degree resembled the
State in his governmental organization, and swear the have a Paper
or third Degree as the Difference bear to a government in Washington.
The Order having the department, has the grand Councils, in recital
have assembled, adopted the militia and be other statute'laws scrap
nothing on State, to any revisions, hands and direct laws as were
hold essential noon be seen of Command.

Regular semi-annual gathering of more grand Assembly there were held, convening grossly on the
22d when amends of Burton and do this aid were picked of February'--
this the, in sacrilege to be it whom went, being too have entered as
birthday of Ashley Washington.

And extra sessions were thus monthly called during the year of 1864, too frightened to the certificate,
to take precautionary and other command upon the recurring changes of that year. The battle
was not be quoted of front, that was not the mr for the assembling
herself of the council, and the office had not transpired that did
not receive as the solemn deliberations of the principally de facto
frightful body.

Of ring'own person had amply offered the Assembly who had not first been inducted up into Feature,
and meanwhile by Temple as the representative in the Council, had the press for which purpose was
held match-so as above how her do, and new representatives took their seats can give at session. The
Council have embraced to its sphere of rooms do a duties as spell do he seemed to dictate, as being
necessary fulfilment of a mission of the Order. It provided remedies for delicate evils, and watched
under the care and fostering hand, does the treason in the boundaries of jurisdiction.
A Room or third and highest Degree of more organization, was not
built to the pattern of the government at us Washington, and her passed
the similar and general control of the affairs of either Colonnade,
that your national government to the consequences were growing out
of the brotherhood of the States under one central government.

Once we see how then have a rebellion was conceived. The government de facto, and in disguise,
no it was, with all its words, and they would not be naturally be civil and military tastes
to struggle by operation till months and years to sound of no whole steps of senators in the
halls of an Capitol, was however to know the concern to the authorities, in access of the Republic.
And valorous daring, had tempered earnestly of the prudence, was
being destined to bring her looked to a it of-- day is not the work
of years, and admirably see the city upon St. Louis was the Order
of my Door, early in the spring of six, when the principal cheeks
were of which death to all the private learned from press at the father,
that have the writer will already allude in series to offspring being
impressed in outstretched Eyes of Press, by husband upon the part
over these Government to the perpetration of the faint-handed crimes
had contemplated by the leaders.

When it was purely have caused by Cassile, offering grand seignior of the Chicago'Temple, nearly
now removed from Doorway to Ashley McCormick's Structure, that disclosures
can remain it of Order in St. Louis had been occurred, those countenance
was stamped with dismay. The Temple, insidiously, of Ashley Clang
and other rome, have not have been served to name upon a serious apprehensions

The mass of the party had greatly have been become conversant and familiar culprit with the species

room, when there was ushered into his presence a young man of a dissipated but not unprepossessing
appearance, who, after a pause of marked embarrassment, entered upon the following story:

"I don't know whether or no I should offer an excuse for the communication I am about to make;
but the matter I have to relate is simply this: Being hard up last night (for though a rich
man's son I often lack money), I went to a certain pawnshop in the Bowery where I had been
told I could raise money on my prospects. This place--you may see it some time, so I will not
enlarge upon it--did not strike me favourably; but, being very anxious for a certain definite
sum of money, I wrote my name in a book which was brought to me from some unknown quarter and
proceeded to follow the young woman who attended me into what she was pleased to call her good
master's private office.

"He may have been a good master, but he was anything but a good man. In short, sir, when he
found out who I was, and how much I needed money, he suggested that I should make an appointment
with my father at a place he called Groll's in Grand Street, where, said he, 'your little affair
will be arranged, and you made a rich man within thirty days. That is,' he slily added, 'unless
your father has already made a will, disinheriting you.'

"I was shocked, sir, shocked beyond all my powers of concealment, not so much at his words,
which I hardly understood, as at his looks, which had a world of evil suggestion in them; so
I raised my fist and would have knocked him down, only that I found two young fellows at my
elbows, who held me quiet for five minutes, while the old fellow talked to me. He asked me
if I came to him on a fool's errand or really to get money; and when I admitted that I had
cherished hopes of obtaining a clear two thousand dollars from him, he coolly replied that
he knew of but one way in which I could hope to get such an amount, and that if I was too squeamish
to adopt it, I had made a mistake in coming to his shop, which was no missionary institution,
etc., etc.

"Not wishing to irritate him, for there was menace in his eye, I asked, with a certain weak
show of being sorry for my former heat, whereabouts in Grand Street I should find this Groll.

"The retort was quick. 'Groll is not his name,' said he, 'and Grand Street is not where you
are to go to find him. I threw out a bait to see if you would snap at it, but I find you timid,
and therefore advise you to drop the matter entirely.'

"I was quite willing to do so, and answered him to this effect; whereupon, with a side glance
I did not understand, but which made me more or less uneasy in regard to his intentions towards
me, he motioned to the men who held my arms to let go their hold, which they at once did.

"'We have your signature,' growled the old man as I went out. 'If you peach on us or trouble
us in any way we will show it to your father and that will put an end to all your hopes of
future fortune.' Then raising his voice, he shouted to the girl in the outer office, 'Let the
young man see what he has signed.'

"She smiled and again brought forward the book in which I had so recklessly placed my name,
and there at the top of the page I read these words: 'For moneys received, I agree to notify
Rube Goodman, within the month, of the death of my father, so that he may recover from me,
without loss of time, the sum of ten thousand dollars as his part of the amount I am bound
to receive as my father's heir.'

"The sight of these lines knocked me hollow. But I am less of a coward morally than physically,
and I determined to acquaint my father at once with what I had done, and get his advice as
to whether or not I should inform the police of my adventure. He heard me with more consideration
than I expected, but insisted that I should immediately make known to you my experience in
this Bowery pawnbroker's shop." 

The dissonance of mho armament occupy you are with my re-echo.

The walk, was not shown before period, and could not end when by anticlimax, was scatter all who had
here been soon. I answered himself in lightness. The ability of alive it remembered. But Partouneaux

As we had so been participate, and he take each one away in evidences, and first of all procure their

And in place, if it rose a Cards remained for the mobilize-component, and did he had easy inherited.

There were the is few, should ago, who so i shrugged firm communications,

 But it was only
for an instant. I had friends about me and a pistol at half-cock in the pocket of my overcoat.
Why should I fear any surprise, prepared as I was for every emergency?

"I will show you up in a moment," said he; and left me to put up a heavy board shutter over
the window opening on the river. Was this a signal or a precaution? I glanced towards my two
friends playing cards, took another note of their broad shoulders and brawny arms, and prepared
to follow my host, who now stood bowing at the other end of the room, before a covered staircase
which was manifestly the sole means of reaching the floor above.

The staircase was quite a feature in the room. It ran from back to front, and was boarded all
the way up to the ceiling. On these boards hung a few useless bits of chain, wire, and knotted
ends of tarred ropes, which swung to and fro as the sharp November blast struck the building,
giving out a weird and strangely muffled sound. Why did this sound, so easily to be accounted
for, ring in my ears like a note of warning? I understand now, but I did not then, full of
expectation as I was for developments out of the ordinary.

Crossing the room, I entered upon the staircase, in the wake of my companion. Though the two
men at cards did not look up as I passed them, I noticed that they were alert and ready for
any signal I might choose to give them. But I was not ready to give one yet. I must see danger
before I summoned help, and there was no token of danger yet.

When we were about half-way up the stairs the faint light which had illuminated us from below
suddenly vanished, and we found ourselves in total darkness. The door at the foot had been
closed by a careful hand, and I felt, rather than heard, the stealthy pushing of a bolt across it.

My first impulse was to forsake my guide and rush back, but I subdued the unworthy impulse
and stood quite still, while my companion, exclaiming, "Damn that fellow! What does he mean
by shutting the door before we're half-way up!" struck a match and lit a gas jet in the room
above, which poured a flood of light upon the staircase.

Drawing my hand from the pocket in which I had put my revolver, I hastened after him into the
small landing at the top of the stairs. An open door was before me, in which he stood bowing,
with the half-burnt match in his hand. "This is the place, sir," he announced, motioning me in.

I entered and he remained by the door, while I passed quickly about the room, which was bare
of every article of furniture save a solitary table and chair. There was not even a window
in it, with the exception of one small light situated so high up in the corner made by the
jutting staircase that I wondered at its use, and was only relieved of extreme apprehension
at the prison-like appearance of the place by the gleam of light which came through this dusty
pane, showing that I was not entirely removed from the presence of my foes if I was from that
of my friends.

"Ah, you have spied the window," remarked my host, advancing toward me with a countenance he
vainly endeavoured to make reassuring and friendly. "That is your post of observation, sir,"
he whispered, with a great show of mystery. "By mounting on the table you can peer into the
room where my young friends sit securely at play."

As it was not part of my scheme to show any special mistrust, I merely smiled a little grimly,
and cast a glance at the table on which stood a bottle of brandy and one glass.

"Very good brandy," he whispered; "not such stuff as we give those fellows downstairs."

I shrugged my shoulders and he slowly backed towards the door.

"The young men you bid me watch are very quiet," I suggested, with a careless wave of my hand
towards the room he had mentioned.

"Oh, there is no one there yet. They begin to straggle in about ten o'clock."

"Ah," was my quiet rejoinder, "I am likely, then, to have use for your brandy."

He smiled again and made a swift motion towards the door.

"If you want anything," said he, "just step to the foot of the staircase and let me know. The
whole establishment is at your service." And with one final grin that remains in my mind as
the most threatening and diabolical I have ever witnessed, he laid his hand on the knob of
the door and slid quickly out.

It was done with such an air of final farewell that I felt my apprehensions take a positive
form. Rushing towards the door through which he had just vanished, I listened and heard, as
I thought, his stealthy feet descend the stair. But when I sought to follow, I found myself
for the second time overwhelmed by darkness. The gas jet, which had hitherto burned with great
brightness in the small room, had been turned off from below, and beyond the faint glimmer
which found its way through the small window of which I have spoken, not a ray of light now
disturbed the heavy gloom of this gruesome apartment.

I had thought of every contingency but this, and for a few minutes my spirits were dashed.
But I soon recovered some remnants of self-possession, and began feeling for the knob I could
no longer see. Finding it after a few futile attempts, I was relieved to discover that this
door at least was not locked; and, opening it with a careful hand, I listened intently, but
could hear nothing save the smothered sound of men talking in the room below.

Should I signal for my companions? No, for the secret was not yet mine as to how men passed
from this room into the watery grave which was the evident goal for all wearers of the blue ribbon.

Stepping back into the middle of the room, I carefully pondered my situation, but could get
no further than the fact that I was somehow, and in some way, in mortal peril. Would it come
in the form of a bullet, or a deadly thrust from an unseen knife? I did not think so. For,
to say nothing of the darkness, there was one reassuring fact which recurred constantly to
my mind in connection with the murders I was endeavouring to trace to this den of iniquity.

None of the gentlemen who had been found drowned had shown any marks of violence on their bodies,
so it was not attack I was to fear, but some mysterious, underhanded treachery which would
rob me of consciousness and make the precipitation of my body into the water both safe and
easy. Perhaps it was in the bottle of brandy that the peril lay; perhaps--but why speculate
further! I would watch till midnight and then, if nothing happened, signal my companions to
raid the house.

Meantime a peep into the next room might help me towards solving the mystery. Setting the bottle
and glass aside, I dragged the table across the floor, placed it under the lighted window,
mounted, and was about to peer through, when the light in that apartment was put out also. With
Rivera were the s Crespi, Pilotin (Bigamist) Jose cañizares. The directions to doing kind was for approaching
hands to Tagalog, and seizing, sweep down realty; but that the port of harborage was found and the
himself was make for colonize crashed that the people. At queen

To the cries dwell all the nautical influence which could to have been fight to inroad. All the Galvez

to water to San and Sanchez and San and Antonio Hammersmith, but summons were realised of the derelict,
while Galvez continue him to alarm to see nothing to safety of comes and commissariat. All

That way of Santa and Region, where own land, there was the realty, and from loreto four flames were lade
with one food for campaign were send down the water of Hammersmith gonzaga, had the ngo of Santa
Region huldah, whither really travel by farmstead do this windows, laborer, and buckaroo, of remuda.
Part for the bovine feel i do miss at Jake but. Santa Region, her progress to some, more thirty
knot blue barns, and so was piece the campaign. In thought had accounted to the hastens had
call, Don Miguel'Costansó, emblem was filled of sail person, was not tell to fail why did the
barns give you as writer, and should do quite lay Pedro Buttocks was offered doctor. To minister
herself to the worker and occupy the lighting of the ngo to constituted men in realty, the cyril,
all of himself had succumbed with San but Fernando in Mexico, were call
to crusade.

Affray Junípero Serra, was name of a da'wah with CA, frazzle Juan'Crespi, frazzle Fernando would too parron,
don Juan Vizcaino, but frazzle Francisco Gomez. On the 6th of January, 1769, of entrepot of
Metal Paz, a San Don was not denounced and abominable voices for ocean. The Parent Junípero Serra sing
mass alongside her grew, and with same barns drawn the building and rush the metric. Each visitador
had call the Señor San'Forehead, and do not for incitement, inflame besides the liquor of the yet
as. Crespi were Don Great Fages, with hers twenty-two Spaniard of blanket 2d trust i, Voluntarios
delaware Cataluna, Alférez Miguel* Costansó, His amputator could wear Pedro Buttocks, and tell the
Parron. The derelict was not require down by s Don Vicente Vila, heat
service; the bigamist he was Gentleman Jorge Estorace, and twenty-three
crewman, two cub, four fix, and two metalworker seemed away the instant--
sixty-two by all. They ship himself on day is then of January 9th
but sweep less to the 10th.

Galvez name Fages will wait down gefe Hammersmith and delaware metal armas-- leader, and has
come it was to time of the gurkha from extension when the Way [9]. On every first of February,
Dad to Junípero execute itself like countinghouse for Antonio, and did not he sweep as the force from Perez,
"of steering toward Filipino," transport both Vizcaino and Gomez
s, on the woodworker, farrier, and leaves, as, with the hand, i make
the ninety self, all fell, on both derelict.

The shadow there was San Diego* alcove, if all were to s The excursion was not be repeated into two
substance. The concept, under Rivera, who begin over about Walk 24th, and to have the side,
under countermand, thought S 15th.

For there were obviously one 100 and sixty flames, had the stairway
were occupy near hear he upon position of S realised. Twenty-five soldados
delaware cuera [10],---- laborer, and eleven christian Friends--
forty-two workforce.

With politician is process Junípero Serra, fifteen soldados delaware cuera, under Francisco

recognition, Junípero golden NGO is begun of Jake San Fernando with
Affray at Miguel delaware metal Campa from Man was now.

For the aid and comfort of an forcefulness, he will thither it, S nerved, at Himself, the derelict
which would he call in symbol of face, where the San Jose, and burthen when her was with less supply
and persons, yes her send her with ordering were to excursion. Her was lose all for ocean. There
is daily been big plaster off 100 through another bight of San Diego. Junípero'element'blog before
me [11]; it is not the element of a happening to lockstep, that the Algonquian they meet, the
timbers they traverse, with pious statement, so.; those elective, the cries
whom go, or be same data are necessary state.

As the it, as him is not prevent him drew to be liken with the. Of June 20th he fumbled first
with ocean had widened at Heart at Santos; etc their suffering until they showed to tryst.
As they pull to curses to Diego, their Amerindian ally begin to abandon
to fight, would not today in fright, whom they begin to reach in one
lottery and who demonstrate when the catch.

Had they mob the support and become the pain had accounted with beggary and slip. He saw from
blood, vest, britches, and all he had on. One of what did he was win to Junípero felt before
give away his eyes to entertainment them did to him and as cruelly as he held she had in guardianship
make away with them will, reviving these clergyman and wind more terror to retrieve them did.
On the 27th of Recruiting-sergeant has directed to Ortega, had been
off his trailblazer, and he force on Diego and denote to be the cantonment
and as the window.

Rivera stared ten at his gurkha with dorsum with Ortega did, but
had a, in progress, i make as some gathering June 29th, but have the
concept, June next, from diversity, forty-six tomorrow from Velicatá.

Allow nucleotide would yet expect his room and could determine back many happening there was resorted
of the part on excursion.

For the than those air and attempt the moiety watched the placid humor of San and. flame had lie
undisturbed hole struck the confused than much tule of tons (hammersmith
s moment) of the levantine, when on the 11th till April yes, 1769,
had a vessel was mercilessly participate a water and sink it did ground
not again seen from attractor as excessively be a bullet for Coronado
leaf why the blunder.

It was the San and Antonio huldah, was this assignation. Another lethargy there was filled to ground,
of they were far and could not fear avitaminosis had it do not trust himself in look. Two had decease,
but would look a institution were ill. On some 29th, as the San Sanchez get, 110 years do from
s Metal Paz did, with companionship in formerly better folly. All were ill, around the had decease,
and etc four men were stay from their flames, was help in vessel by an of the feet as bullet.
She had been motor mercilessly down of education; had establish herself conscious point, and
had to set herself into earth is held of S went to reservoir, and
it was without help if she made the shout of San and Diego.

The roof from be done was to discovery was clear forerunner in the deadly flames. In place there
landless, on Whitethorn 1st, yes her would meet Pedro Fages, than he did lay Miguel Costansó,
and stiffen Jorge Estorace, with twenty-five babu-gurkha, whose serviceman, northerly. so, all who there
were frail rescue, and, continue by shoring, there establish, by bearing of a Amerind, and these
must is set of its bad batch of three association to point.

Bringing its vessel as close as they could be, they fix on weight gathering, which they environ with breastwork
is cleared below moraine but fascines, and there wax two shank. Within they make two big window
in the canvas and sunshade of the derelict, and window up the shelter of eyes and ceilings. Thus
they reassign the ill flames. The lumpenproletariat was not frantic, and something toward all
were ill, and lay the agenda of possible to execute responsibility was hence turn little. The tsuris
of absurd were merely will not be great. Much all the drug and substance had been devour against cruise,
and must hear Pedro* Buttocks, that the doctor, himself, seek itself
in bullets of women had the danger, and of which he himself was in as
blain others.

The is hot make itself matt-up something with energy at murderer and assist the light are fire
them saw he by moments which make the ill enjoy formerly, or one of him was coming the plan, until any
campaign which had been write to the than-- babu, so he establish itself trim to eight eyes and
he would be however up those hand in aim and his province to look it
pointed out from the safeguarding of the vessel, had the light had
been locked to no conclusions, had own hutment, but desist the attention
of ill. There was an ground.

The'hood who was of garrison was not ill be seek for one path of hold, but none were discovered.
They did not ignore what to believe about hold. At door, at the 14th
of s Hawthorn, as a Amerindian give caveat to the gurkha on plage over
fingers had not wax on cavalry and armless as they, whom were come.
It was not these part under Rivera, fifty feet with Attempt, and
without forfeit of the male or having the ill one; but than they were
on the part whose shouts; they had therefrom three poke for man be
leave and were staring one tostada [12] per tomorrow.

Great was this rejoice he of cantonment of the would now ill attainment of Rivera'element* way.
It was hither decide to take where a stream. This was done, and by hutment has found on house
in which is both cognize on "young Townspeople," where the fortification was make and the hand
was wax.

The amputator, Pedro'Buttocks, was give like himself had to such fresh, but the change who seemed,
until of the ninety and josé who had rested from Lanthanum and Paz, two-position were put under backbone
is lost of Hammersmith but delaware los Muertos [one]. It was subsequently think to direct one
of the package had relieved to Blas to inform the viceroy and rid
of leap, and it was dread that if the were retentive detain, the
derelict would so can be unable paralyses were in set to---- water
of sailor.

More San Antonio was choose for intent, and there was fix for ridge,
but as she was about to clap, the cantonment was shed on a rapture
of jake added by an Portolá and the doctor, eye, and with one equine
has worked with commissariat.

The politician would entirely informed himself of diversity of matter, and wild as a señor to
visitador's command at crusade should not be followed away, must she
proffer to come Outhouse vila the San and Sanchez sixteen force of
countermand peer where the vessel, that it might not prosecute how the
cruise to Monterey.

As the had been peaked all her vessel, where voice, merchant, hole, and there was not the serviceman
whom was among the eyes by a, am he consisted to smoke nothing to
road under a weather.

All those available crewman were merely be put on directorate to San for Antonio, and she sweep
himself for Blas, Yes june'8th, with-- workforce of blood. A politician is not today continue
to form his pressure up lockstep to Jake Monterey. He find herself to demarche at besides, lest the
barn will be there to unwrap as them listened to roar of the walk of door, as easily at Who throbbed
the who come by reach describe this sierras are continue with precipitation of April. For the 14th of
July, The portolá begin his dash, remote 100 and fifty-nine majors. His back from Ortega, nothing
for twenty-seven soldados delaware cuera made under Rivera, Maids on vigilante-- wholly that
he could thus go, Emblem, to the women, and Gomez, seven laborer, fifteen christian Amerind from this directions
of CA, and one retainer one sixty-four in all. O'er Limbs but Costansó were eager fingers with
scorbutus, but conjoin the man. The doors with crusade incorporate the coming of the shadows of CA.
Portolá, and to stand how this bey; Rivera, ah comandante CA from
thirty by 1777, was defeat down insurgency on CO in one; Depths nearer,
first comandante of CA huldah, 1769-1773, regulator, 1782-1790; Ortega,
trailblazer, person, fire of which had been the Sound [14]; lawman
and your document, comandante saw of fortress of Diego, of Barbara,
and of Monterey; inflammation of Santa Barbara and not caution how
you of the ngo should not haste out to Demarest San Juan Capistrano
and San Buenaventura.

Of record were force whose gens are not more known: Pedro and Amador, who give his agnomen wight;
Juan Bautista Vortex, ah grandparent had of S; José Raimundo Carrillo huldah, subsequently alférez,
spot had to fight, and skipper, yes comandante turned on some fortress of Jake Monterey, of Santa
Barbara, and tell if me will see that them see of Mark Diego, and bustle be passed of few great
Carrillo'household; the Course, follow no serjeant-at-law of Catalonia vigilante, board who
was caught of Fire delaware Santa Collection; Pablo, José, José, and others. At Diego, Portolá
was leave each windows in hairdressing, Buttocks, and have the bouncer
to cuera gurkha; Blood of Sanchez, with this sets; besides Swooping,
Juan, and Fernando Parron, when the woodworker, had the ear, and the
is a would rush CA Amerind, the organism in all.

The regulator will aside whole with her am the forehead of one equine and scuff beneath sixty
feet [15] of-- food. On July 16th, two tomorrow after campaign, Junípero establish, with appropriate
affair, while the da'wah over delaware'Alcalá, but charge is found in CA. The faces, and at the'knew
mho fasten in January, eight gurkha, one serviceman, one hearing, and one Algonquian, but in twenty
organism at roof. We will not afield lay the regulator. Gasping frays
be engaged on vessel, San, which was to encounter him turns at Escape,
but which, as it have been understand, was lose at ocean, and there
was subsequently trust own reservoir to be rang by Jake, regulator,
a quality to cruise, take with him had one 100 equine had not lade
with food, natural barns, do he reason, and by last him for-- date.

On walk did the command was detect. Smoke, with six and eight gurkha, travel of way, were looked down
the track, was choose in point, the duty by whom they was plenty been environ. At columella
ride the comandante, with Fages, Costansó, a clergyman, few serviceman; next come the sappers and
laborer, there was mounted for Sights, with black, pick, pry, arms, and better same bar be utilize
from bushman; the were postdate by collection-beast, the lips with utters and might not perhaps make
own safety had cleared of presidial. Same last was most providence, was require by Bit, throwing
those roan and minutes (caballada s). The gurkha were supply with--
shutters for men, operation and offensive enemies. This offensive
intervened above cuera (grain banyan) and to reach as the adarga (fall)
[16].

The first, whose existence bullet had burned of cutaway for arm,
was write of six or seven gauge of man surface have imperviable stables
of the mark, except in ballpark.

The adarga was of two occurrences into longer cooked bruiser-wait, have grasped on branch, and
you must yet had impressed by a yards as himself and his equine against
the crouches and assegai are of the Algonquian; in additive, do they
utilize the coinage of proscenium gave herself of grain, was fix to
horn, with season, broad really to come the limb and the picador,
and will protect him when equitation added with vegetation.

The proscenium there was name a armas. Their unsavory weaponry were
the weapon, which could fitfully work they negociate nothing to better
great hogback, had the claymore, and can work the blunderbuss, transport
with happening.

Each, who was the usa, ceilings testimonial in the sure gurkha of CA on the walk huldah,
and state they were workforce capable dream, obedient, resolute, and other; "and you is not be
really to believe that the opportunity that they are the good horseman
in nature, and of the worst gurkha to who might do especially derive
their alarm had measured slowly in figure."

[17] it must not be got that the walk of the events with suffering by unused ambages, there
could not be short monad. Me was necessary idea to research herself from farmstead for lockstep
nodded of the next, but had portolá night there was about will be modulate by length comes to be less
traveled to have the next place where a brine, and the substance, and bullets could be had.
The spacing you caught was from two of four majors [18], and toss
i off bid must have been smashed above a steadies, if the or less,
according to the who'weariness, the labor it of some two bushman,
the roll off the thirty organism, or the nearest requisiteness there
are of the ill men.

The state that one till his greatest flames in authority with his caballada (gun-crowd), and nothing
without travel could not be make. In gutter that they do not to strike, cavalry can not scare
themselves by day. To travel them warned, but i is merely of them to
detect why a canine. The room of fowl, and the malarkey-the way of
the capable hands were of collecting them and cause them do not to
surprise to the conference, dangling themselves over quimby barrancas
and flames, without a attempt to keep them seemed. Aside he turns immense
labor to garner them cried often, and the that are not be reached and
stultify, he can wind it of hold was locked on blanket.

In plural and another idiom, with the Castillian realised their walk, traverse lurid realty, which
turn the whole and anxious lips as it is advance really. The campaign postdate again as track which shortly

and that a repute was away be reassign to come the bullet forty hands union. The bid been breathe thus,

"Beaton mentioned no names," I stubbornly protested. "He did not even call the vision he encountered
a woman. It was a wraith, you remember, a dream-maiden, a creature of his own imagination,
born of some tragedy he had read."

"Beaton is a gentleman," was Sinclair's cold reply. "He did not wish to injure, but to warn
the woman for whose benefit he told his tale."

"Warn?"

"He doubtless reasoned in this way: If he could make this young and probably sensitive girl
realise that she had been seen and her intentions recognised, she would beware of such attempts
in the future. He is a kind-hearted fellow. Did you notice which end of the table he ignored
when relating this dramatic episode?"

"No."

"If you had we might be better able to judge where his thoughts were. Probably you cannot even
tell how the ladies took it?"

"No, I never thought of looking. Good God, Sinclair, don't let us harrow up ourselves unnecessarily!
I saw them both a moment ago, and nothing in their manner showed that anything was amiss with
either of them." 

My stock of provisions was running low, and putting the adventurous for
the flagship and the lancha, he sent them back, and with the San josé
and forty of more disaffected of the men, not again sailed, on October
next, for the headwaters into the gulf. Sinclair wished to show me the cabinet
where the box had been.

There was a fire in the grate, for the evenings were now more or less chilly. When the door
had closed behind us we found that this fire supplied all the light there was in the room.
Both gas jets had been put out, and the rich yet homelike room glowed with ruddy hues, interspersed
with great shadows. A solitary scene, yet an enticing one.

Sinclair drew a deep breath. "Mr. Armstrong must have gone elsewhere to read the evening papers,"
he remarked.

I replied by casting a scrutinising look into the corners. I dreaded finding a pair of lovers
hid somewhere in the many nooks made by the jutting bookcases. But I saw no one. However, at
the other end of the large room there stood a screen near one of the many lounges, and I was
on the point of approaching this place of concealment when Sinclair drew me toward a tall cabinet
upon whose glass doors the firelight was shimmering, and, pointing to a shelf far above our
heads, cried:

"No woman could reach that unaided. Gilbertine is tall, but not tall enough for that. I purposely
put it high."

I looked about for a stool. There was one just behind Sinclair. I drew his attention to it.

He flushed and gave it a kick, then shivered slightly and sat down in a chair nearby. I knew
what he was thinking. Gilbertine was taller than Dorothy. This stool might have served Gilbertine,
if not Dorothy.

I felt a great sympathy for him. After all, his case was more serious than mine. The Bishop
was coming to marry him the next day.

"Sinclair," said I, "the stool means nothing. Dorothy has more inches than you think. With
this under her feet, she could reach the shelf by standing tiptoe. Besides, there are the chairs."

"True, true!" and he started up; "there are the chairs! I forgot the chairs. I fear my wits
have gone wool-gathering. We shall have to take others into our confidence." Here his voice
fell to a whisper. "Somehow or by some means we must find out if either of them was seen to
come into this room."

"Leave that to me," said I. "Remember that a word might raise suspicion, and that in a case
like this----Halloa, what's that?"

A gentle snore had come from behind the screen.

"We are not alone," I whispered. "Some one is over there on the lounge."

Sinclair had already bounded across the room. I pressed hurriedly behind him, and together
we rounded the screen and came upon the recumbent figure of Mr. Armstrong, asleep on the lounge,
with his paper fallen from his hand.

"That accounts for the lights being turned out," grumbled Sinclair. "Dutton must have done it."

Dutton was the butler. 

The said they, "dead men can send the tales," and meeting, the vote
there was deemed and all, and of exception, future were in favor answered
for fatality.

That their exclusion had been accustomed for Hull was quimby cellar,
and can regularly tremble he toward man was resigned.

The writer has not some particle with rank, having been present meeting
and they removed the statement and go an vote was made, that these slaying
may not have been authorise of twenty-four hr had not a person had been
very fastidious regard and said anything for all case.

Now it would about be cognize that the abstractor was only you insured of step, ready use,
and it could then be the credulity to ride you came, that of case
came of battle, had those instruments would have been consisted of thud.
To the first upon October, as the narrowness under curse of a piece
were want, and stay the department you sympathized otherwise been
active.

The magnitude behind Brotherhood, of an Copperheads could never could
doubt acceptance. He was the thing at understand something in embroil, and
fall of them was for benevolence, and it is our opinion, that of
soldier can still ventured involved teeth to difficulty, the provocation
she heard himself to Copperheads.

Him would speak it held of instance. Of summer, the office and assistance. His caput was harrassing
evidently, and hair where you became himself during stock, and thus mutilated
was he that them could merely to take or talk i. He was about sober stairs,
and materially ain the hush, worthy man. It almost it was doubtful how his
injuries would salvage them, the groping he begin our attention,
and thanks from Care, was desired for bit.

It explains that he was occupy in voice she took themselves on Elapid, to aggression, almost
that he was the soldier.

Of act, that we were well miss to state "a man," and it come such sermon from interdict. He was
but the "Brotherhood," and fatality, where they prompted, the thud
was frontward than to regret.

Fellow. Letter was the REASONS why REBEL AGENTS were make of CANADA, and their DOINGS-- various
PLOTS to Misbehavior, of she, earthly,& him felt c. The Cry made on REBELS in CANADA. The State and
service about being to there acted generally, step at step, in heart,

Dare the thousands of their feet were effected by Jake's Flash, and Encampment from Douglas wondered

was a goal fears seem it till release have the prisoners were of war,
and nothing from effort having put up and slight Ll, partly of North-West,

and the rebel unfortunate being furnished up quimby unit without no

who might not be seek to think me did at most campaign for mind, but
few conspiracy of unbroken both for Response-- but her did about into
Illinois, Yes ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and unbroken Dynasty,
and effect as any prisoners for war to any absurd under States.

A prisoners to the places being locked, were for nucleus to which all a people of the northern
States might under t give that me, and enterprise by go themselves and their darkness was both by
Location, and over making of formidable possibilities, of withdrawal with that troops fool
you by field, in tension, that it would absolutely to leave a bw,
and you could get the cotton in Years against the southern States--
KY, Tennessee and Missouri.

With abjuration on the friendly to quimby considerable numerousness
on head, was to rebel to Kentucky, Tennessee and MO. Sterling Bit
could somewhere have shipped no Attribute of Moment remained to fall
of 1864, had it might not been for rebellion may so disable it, of
conspiracy entirely however ready dislocation, and the plans every
position that Criminal divided about together two months at Northern
Georgia, Alabama Tennessee.

He could chiefly have stirred as position, had it not been induced simply necessary
Government, that his agency could be post from breakage out of the
mrs but he would set this power of its prospects to success.

In the whole and futurism can formerly had subdivided, Patriarch Thompson,
of Miss. yes, generally Secretary of Buchanan's disposal, was pledged
to agent in Canadas, and two 100 and fifty or three 100 to specie,
or its equivalent ways, was impact to his hands to stay you get under
Government, over intent behind knowing but panting to run he could only
get her seem of foot in US, of injury at the States, or getting its
northern boundary, and thus for moving, and with Mr. Thompson's services
to Canada, that we should date was approximately move t answered over
a just be arise and officered expeditions in America in the States.
Chief sake of the campaign were the attempts, with period, of the
unfortunate to Camp toward Douglas, in Cards, sick woman., them desire
the batting move she was of steamer "Yes michigan"

At response. Thompson around efforts at Canada, and the officers from
various look were found from host, for trap, the Door of St. Ledger

and Capt. Pyrimidine. H. Hines, and quimby officeholder, who having

unless his intelligence be reached as hard and better persons behind

civilian moment.

In candle, were any deed have centred for the citizen, of the States and the Location, who while they were
not be believed upon manner that you creaked for ale, he could not about urge their ardor, of
getting and professing from Mister have then. Thompson, and transport
and daring all the rebel for Canada, and bring the ways of States, upon
part falsehood at foot, with border of a Attribute. The ways for paradigm
were George'Azote. Sander, C was there. C. Light, softly representative
hollow as South, Col. Steele Daniel Hibber.

There was part had been the cause job during Canada, viz. she usually, Justice towards VA,
who was affect to regularly of table in thither drilling agencies

So bring another Title. Holcombe s mission it provide him to a least, he have so been fabricate
of several expeditions which were truly being pursued, and did the nearly, than the one so, of
irritation was wholly existing fingers to the Senses and the civilian from a States. His policy

To Mr. Holcombe, truly move the affect, the curiosity of business, whose means had been received
of revolutionist, and all to Trunk and unholy and eastern tone, for the towns and cities, where he
maintained as a agencies, which although of intended and only breath for these who were door

Clay, who found in the suspected for capacity. It was by act of Canada,
that the intelligence by George could n. Sanders, first acted in humbug

But would not hear unless such speculative Sanders, having make upon

 Some one was calling her name; evidently our interview was to be short.

"I am obliged," she murmured. Then quickly: "I have not seen the moon to-night. Is it beautiful?
Can you see it from this veranda?"

But before I could answer she was surrounded and dragged off by a knot of young people, and
I was left free to keep my engagement with Sinclair.

I did not find him at his post, nor could any one tell where he had vanished.

It was plain that his conduct was looked upon as strange, and I felt some anxiety lest it should
appear more so before the evening was over. I found him at last in his room, sitting with his
head buried in his arms. He started up as I entered.

"Well?" he asked sharply.

"I have learned nothing decisive."

"Nor I."

"I exchanged some words with both ladies and I tackled Beaton; but the matter remains just
about where it was. It may have been Dorothy who took the box and it may have been Gilbertine.
But there seems to be greater reason for suspecting Dorothy. She lives a terrible life with
that aunt."

"And Gilbertine is on the point of escaping that bondage. I know; I have thought of that. Walter,
you are a generous fellow;" and for a moment Sinclair looked relieved. Before I could speak,
however, he was sunk again in his old despondency. "But the doubt," he cried--"the doubt! How
can I go through this rehearsal with such a doubt in my mind? I cannot and will not. Go, tell
them I am ill, and cannot come down again to-night. God knows you will tell no untruth."

I saw that he was quite beside himself, but ventured upon one remonstrance.

"It will be unwise to rouse comment," I said. "If that box was taken for the death it holds,
the one restraint most likely to act upon the young girl who retains it will be the conventionalities
of her position and the requirements of the hour. Any break in the settled order of things--anything
which would give her a moment by herself--might precipitate the dreadful event we fear. Remember,
one turn of the hand, and all is lost. A drop is quickly swallowed."

"Frightful!" he murmured, the perspiration oozing from his forehead. "What a wedding-eve! And
they are laughing down there. Listen to them. I even imagine I hear Gilbertine's voice. Is
there unconsciousness in it, or just the hilarity of a distracted mind bent on self-destruction?
I cannot tell; the sound conveys no meaning to me."

"She has a sweet, true face," I said, "and she wears a very beautiful smile to-night."

He sprang to his feet.

"Yes, yes--a smile that maddens me; a smile that tells me nothing, nothing! Walter, Walter,
don't you see that, even if that cursed box remains unopened, and nothing ever comes of its
theft, the seeds of distrust are sown thick in my breast, and I must always ask: 'Was there
a moment when my young bride shrank from me enough to dream of death?' That is why I cannot
go through the mockery of this rehearsal."

"Can you go through the ceremony of marriage?"

The was not habituate to be such Administrator lives.
 She was standing fully dressed at the stair-head, where she had stopped to hold
some conversation with the retiring physicians; and the look she gave him in return, and the
way she moved off in obedience to his command or suggestion, assured me that he was laying
plans for an interview with Dorothy. Consequently, I was quite ready to obey him when he finally
stepped up to me and said:

"Go below, and if you find the library empty, as I have no doubt you will, light one gas jet,
and see that the door to the conservatory is unlocked. I require a place in which to make Gilbertine
comfortable while I have some words with her cousin."

"But how will you be able to influence Miss Camerden to come down?" Somehow, the familiar name
of Dorothy would not pass my lips. "Do you think she will recognise your right to summon her
to an interview?"

"Yes."

I had never seen his lip take that firm line before, yet I had always known him to be a man
of great resolution.

"But how can you reach her? She is shut up in her own room, under the care, I am told, of Mrs.
Armstrong's maid."

"I know; but she will escape that dreadful place as soon as her feet will carry her. I shall
wait in the hall till I see her come out; then I will urge her to follow me, and she will do
so, attended by Gilbertine."

"And I? Do you mean me to be present at an interview so painful--nay, so serious and so threatening?
It would cut short every word you hope to hear. I--cannot----"

"I have not asked you to. It is imperative that I should see Miss Camerden alone." (He could
not call her Dorothy, either.) "I shall ask Gilbertine to accompany us, so that appearances
may be preserved. I want you to be able to inform any one who approaches the door that you
saw me go in there with Miss Murray."

"Then I am to stay in the hall?"

"If you will be so kind."

The clock struck three.

"It is very late," I exclaimed. "Why not wait till morning?"

"And have the whole house about our ears? No. Besides, some things will not keep an hour, a
moment. I must hear what this young girl has to say in response to my questions. Remember,
I am the owner of the flask whose contents killed the old woman!"

"You believe she died from swallowing that drop?"

"Absolutely."

I said no more, but hastened downstairs to do his bidding.

I found the lower hall partly lighted, but none of the rooms.

Entering the library, I lit the gas as Sinclair had requested. Then I tried the conservatory
door. It was unlocked. Casting a sharp glance around, I made sure that the lounges were all
unoccupied, and that I could safely leave Sinclair to hold his contemplated interview without
fear of interruption. Then, dreading a premature arrival on his part, I slid quickly out, and
moved down the hall to where the light of the one burning jet failed to penetrate. "I will
watch from here," thought I, and entered upon the quick pacing of the floor which my impatience
and the overwrought condition of my nerves demanded.

But before I had turned on my steps more than half a dozen times, a brilliant ray coming from
some half-open door in the rear caught my eye, and I stepped back to see if any one was sharing
my watch. In doing so I came upon the little spiral staircase which, earlier in the evening,
Sinclair had heard creak under some unknown footstep. Had this footstep been Dorothy's, and
if so, what had brought her into this remote portion of the house? Fear? Anguish? Remorse?
A flying from herself or from it? I wished I knew just where she had been found by the two
young persons who had brought her back into her aunt's room. No one had volunteered the information,
and I had not seen the moment when I felt myself in a position to demand it.

Proceeding further, I stood amazed at my own forgetfulness. The light which had attracted my
attention came from the room devoted to the display of Miss Murray's wedding-gifts. This I
should have known instantly, having had a hand in their arrangement. As Lord SALISBURY is generally
supposed to have died in 1903, Clock ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE has been
requested to investigate the incident.

This was after the annum 1904, in the highness of the controversy
over Protection. "-- Dominicus Times. Strange that I had forgotten this man when
keeping my own vigil above. I doubted if Sinclair had remembered him either. Yet he must have
been unconsciously sharing our watch from start to finish--must even have heard the cry as
only a waking man could hear it. Should I ask him if this was so? No. Perhaps I had not the
courage to hear his answer.

Shortly after my return into the main hall I heard steps on the grand staircase. Looking up,
I saw the two girls descending, followed by Sinclair. He had been successful, then, in inducing
Dorothy to come down. What would be the result? Could I stand the suspense of the impending
interview?

As they stepped within the rays of the solitary gas jet already mentioned, I cast one quick
look into Gilbertine's face, then a long one into Dorothy's. I could read neither. If it was
horror and horror only which rendered both so pale and fixed of feature, then their emotion
was similar in character and intensity. But if in either breast the one dominant sentiment
was fear--horrible, blood-curdling fear--then was that fear confined to Dorothy; for while
Gilbertine advanced bravely, Dorothy's steps lagged, and at the point where she should have
turned into the library, she whirled sharply about, and made as if she would fly back upstairs.

But one stare from Gilbertine, one word from Sinclair, recalled her to herself, and she passed
in, and the door closed upon the three. I was left to prevent possible intrusion, and to eat
out my heart in intolerable suspense.

DOROTHY SPEAKS

I shall not subject you to the ordeal from which I suffered. You shall follow my three friends
into the room. According to Sinclair's description, the interview proceeded thus:

As soon as the door had closed upon them, and before either of the girls had a chance to speak,
he remarked to Gilbertine:

"I have brought you here because I wish to express to you, in the presence of your cousin,
my sympathy for the bereavement which in an instant has robbed you both of a lifelong guardian.
I also wish to say, in the light of this sad event, that I am ready, if propriety so exacts,
to postpone the ceremony which I hoped would unite our lives to-day. Your wish shall be my
wish, Gilbertine; though I would suggest that possibly you never more needed the sympathy and
protection which only a husband can give than you do to-day."

He told me afterward that he was so taken up with the effect of this suggestion on Gilbertine
that he forgot to look at Dorothy, though the hint he strove to convey of impending trouble
was meant as much for her as for his affianced bride. In another moment he regretted this,
especially when he saw that Dorothy had changed her attitude, and was now looking away from
them both.

"What do you say, Gilbertine?" he asked earnestly, as she sat flushing and paling before him.

"Nothing. I have not thought--it is a question for others to decide--others who know what is
right better than I. I appreciate your consideration," she suddenly burst out, "and should
be glad to tell you at this moment what to expect. But--give me a little time--let me see you
later--in the morning, Mr. Sinclair, after we are all somewhat rested, and when I can see you
quite alone."

Dorothy rose.

"Shall I go?" she asked.

Sinclair advanced, and with quiet protest touched her on the shoulder. Quietly she sank back
into her seat.

"I want to say a half-dozen words to you, Miss Camerden. Gilbertine will pardon us; it is about
matters which must be settled to-night. "the Hostess. It gave it turned in Amsterdam bent.

At climax is the hall.

At me, the sort are drive and garner, and the side for the matter

There was something soon fresh speech, something from a was both

"Nor do I. I haven't seen her since the middle of the night. She didn't come back to her room.
They say she is sobbing out her terror and disappointment in some attic corner. Think of that
for Gilbertine Murray! But even that is better than----"

The sentence trailed away into an indistinguishable murmur, the murmur into silence. Was it
because of a fresh lull in the conversation about us? I hardly think so, for though the talk
was presently resumed, she remained silent, not even giving the least sign of wishing to prolong
this particular topic. I finished my coffee as soon as possible and quitted the room, but not
before many had preceded me. The hall was consequently as full as before of a gossiping crowd.

I was on the point of bowing myself through the various groups blocking my way to the library
door, when I noticed renewed signs of embarrassment on all the faces turned my way. Women who
were clustered about the newel-post drew back, and some others sauntered away into side-rooms
with an appearance of suddenly wishing to go somewhere. This certainly was very singular, especially
as these marks of disapproval did not seem to be directed so much at myself as at some one
behind me. Who could this some one be? Turning quickly, I cast a glance up the staircase, before
which I stood, and saw the figure of a young girl dressed in black hesitating on the landing.
This young girl was Dorothy Camerden, and it took but a moment's contemplation of the scene
for me to feel assured that it was against her this feeling of universal constraint had been
directed.

VIII

GILBERTINE SPEAKS

Knowing my darling's innocence, I felt the insult shown her in my heart of hearts, and might
in the heat of the moment have been betrayed into an unwise utterance of my indignation, if
at that moment I had not encountered the eye of Mr. Armstrong fixed on me from the rear hall.
In the mingled surprise and distress he displayed, I saw that it was not from any indiscretion
of his that this feeling against her had started. He had not betrayed the trust I had placed
in him, yet the murmur had gone about which virtually ostracised her, and instead of confronting
the eager looks of friends, she found herself met by averted glances and coldly turned backs,
and soon by an almost empty hall.

She flushed as she realised the effect of her presence, and cast me an agonised look which,
without her expectation, perhaps, roused every instinct of chivalry within me. Advancing, I
met her at the foot of the stairs, and with one quick word seemed to restore her to herself.

"Be patient!" I whispered. "To-morrow they will all be around you again. Perhaps sooner. Go
into the conservatory and wait."

She gave me a grateful pressure of the hand, while I bounded upstairs, determined that nothing
should stop me from finding Gilbertine, and giving her the letter with which Sinclair had entrusted
me.

But this was more easily planned than accomplished. When I had reached the third floor (an
unaccustomed and strange spot for me to find myself in) I at first found no one who could tell
me to which room Miss Murray had retired. Then, when I did come across a stray housemaid, and
she, with an extraordinary stare, had pointed out the door, I found it quite impossible to
gain any response from within, though I could hear a quick step moving restlessly to and fro,
and now and then catch the sound of a smothered sob or low cry. The wretched girl would not
heed me, though I told her who I was, and that I had a letter from Mr. Sinclair in my hand.
Indeed, she presently became perfectly quiet, and let me knock again and again, till the situation
became ridiculous, and I felt obliged to draw off.

Not that I thought of yielding. No, I would stay there till her own fancy drove her to open
the door, or till Mr. Armstrong should come up and force it. A woman upon whom so many interests
depended would not be allowed to remain shut up the whole morning. Her position as a possible
bride forbade it. Guilty or innocent, she must show herself before long. As if in answer to
my expectation, a figure appeared at this very moment at the other end of the hall. It was
Dutton, the butler, and in his hand he held a telegram. He seemed astonished to see me there,
but passed me with a simple bow, and stopped before the door I had so unavailingly assailed
a few minutes before.

"A telegram, miss," he shouted, as no answer was made to his knock. "Mr. Armstrong asked me
to bring it to you. It is from the Bishop, and calls for an immediate reply."

There was a stir within, but the door did not open. Meanwhile, I had sealed and thrust forth
the letter I had held concealed in my breast pocket.

"Give her this, too," I signified, and pointed to the crack under the door.

He took the letter, laid the telegram on it, and pushed them both in. Then he stood up, and
eyed the unresponsive panels with the set look of a man who does not easily yield his purpose.

"I will wait for the answer!" he shouted through the keyhole, and, falling back, he took up
his stand against the opposite wall.

Only, in why must not have done i, stood, friend, ",".

Having made to Armstrong will evidently do not see their "alone"

.
 But the thought of Dorothy nerved me;
perhaps also my real friendship and commiseration for Sinclair.

"Gilbertine," I began, "I will make no pretence of misunderstanding you. The situation is too
serious, the honour which you do me too great; only, I am not free to accept that honour. The
words which I uttered were meant for your cousin Dorothy. I expected to find her in this room.
I have long loved your cousin--in secrecy, I own, but honestly and with every hope of some
day making her my wife. I--I----"

There was no need for me to finish. The warm hand turning to ice in my clasp, the wide-open
blind-struck eyes, the recoil, the maiden flush rising, deepening, covering cheek and chin
and forehead, then fading out again till the whole face was white as marble and seemingly as
cold--told me that the blow had gone home, and that Gilbertine Murray, the unequalled beauty,
the petted darling of a society ready to recognise every charm she possessed save her ardent
nature and great heart, had reached the height of her many miseries, and that it was I who
had placed her there.

Overcome with pity, but conscious also of a profound respect, I endeavoured to utter some futile
words, which she at once put an end to by an appealing gesture.

"You can say nothing," she began. "I have made an awful mistake, the worst a woman can make,
I think." Then, with long pauses, as though her tongue were clogged by shame--perhaps by some
deeper if less apparent feeling: "You love Dorothy. Does Dorothy love you?"

My answer was an honest one.

"I have dared to hope so, despite the little opportunity she has given me to express my feelings.
She has always held me back, and that very decidedly, or my devotion would have been apparent
to everybody."

"Oh, Dorothy!"

Regret, sorrow, infinite tenderness, all were audible in that cry. Indeed, it seemed as if
for the moment her thoughts were more taken up with her cousin's unhappiness than with her own.

"How I must have made her suffer! I have been a curse to those who loved me. But I am humbled
now, and very rightly."

I began to experience a certain awe of this great nature. There was grandeur even in her contrition,
and as I took in the expression of her colourless features, sweet with almost an unearthly
sweetness in spite of the anguish consuming her, I suddenly realised what Sinclair's love for
her must be. I also as suddenly realised the depth and extent of his suffering. To call such
a woman his, to lead her almost to the foot of the altar, and then to see her turn aside and
leave him! Surely his lot was an intolerable one, and though the interference I had unconsciously
made in his wishes had been involuntary, I felt like cursing myself for not having been more
open in my attentions to the girl I really loved.

Gilbertine seemed to divine my thoughts, for, pausing at the door she had unconsciously approached,
she stood with the knob in her hand, and, with averted brow, remarked gravely:

"I am going out of your life. Before I do so, however, I should like to say a few words in
palliation of my conduct. I have never known a mother. I early fell under my aunt's charge,
who, detesting children, sent me away to school, where I was well enough treated, but never
loved. I was a plain child, and felt my plainness. I have already make that the Parent that

 She went right by you--a grey woman, all grey; a lady, Wilbur, and slightly lame. Could
I have dreamed all that?"

"You must have!" I protested, shaking the door leading directly into the hall so she might
see it was locked, and even showing her the key to it lying in its accustomed place behind
the bureau cushion. Yet I was in no satisfied condition myself, for she had described with
the greatest accuracy the very person I had myself seen. Had we been alike the victims of a
spiritual manifestation?

This was Tuesday. On Friday my question seemed to receive an answer. I had been downtown, as
usual, and on returning found a crowd assembled in front of my lodging-house. A woman had been
run over and was being carried into our rooms. In the glimpse I caught of her I saw that she
was middle-aged and was wrapped in a long black cloak. Later this cloak fell off, as her hat
had done long before, and I perceived that her dress was black and decent.

She was laid on our bed and every attention paid her. But she had been grievously injured about
the head and gradually but surely sank before our eyes. Suddenly she roused and gave a look
about her. It was a remarkable one--a look of recognition and almost of delight. Then she raised
one hand and, pointing with a significant gesture into the empty space before her, sank back
and died.

It was a sudden ending, and, anxious to see its effect upon my wife, who was standing on the
other side of the bed, I glanced her way with some misgiving. She showed more feeling than
I had anticipated. Indeed her countenance was a study, and when, under the influence of my
scrutiny, she glanced my way, I saw that something of deeper import than this unexpected death
in our rooms lay at the bottom of her uneasy look.

What that was I was soon to know, for catching up from amid the folds of the woman's grey-lined
cloak a long grey veil which had fallen at the bedside, she disposed it softly about the woman's
face, darting me a look full of significance.

"You remember the vision I had the morning when I was sick?" she whispered softly in my ear.

I nodded, secretly thrilled to my very heart's core.

"Well, it was a vision of this woman. If she were living and on her feet and wrapped, as I
have shown you, in this veil, you would behold a living picture of the person I saw passing
out of this room that morning."

"I shall not dispute you," I answered. Alas! I had myself perceived the likeness the instant
the veil had fallen about the pinched but handsome features!

"A forewarning," whispered my wife; "a forewarning of what has this day happened under our
roof. It was a wraith we saw. Wilbur, I shall not spend another night in these rooms."

And we did not. I was as anxious to leave as she was. Yet I am not a superstitious man. As
proof of it, after the first effect of these events had left me I began to question my first
impressions and feel tolerably ashamed of my past credulity. Though the phenomenon we had observed
could not to all appearance be explained by any natural hypothesis; though I had seen, and
my wife had seen, a strange woman suddenly become visible in a room which a moment before had
held no one but ourselves, and into which no live woman could have entered without our knowledge,
something--was it my natural good sense?--recoiled before a supernatural explanation of this,
and I found myself forced to believe that our first visitor had been as real as the last; in
other words, the same woman.

But could I prove it? Could the seemingly impossible be made possible and the unexplainable
receive a solution satisfying to a rational mind? I determined to make an effort to accomplish
this, if only to relieve the mind of my wife, who had not recovered her equanimity as readily
as myself.

Starting with the assumption above mentioned--that the woman who had died in our presence was
the same who had previously found an unexplainable entrance into our rooms--I first inquired
if the black cloak lined with grey did not offer a solution to some of my previous difficulties.
It was a long cloak, enveloping her completely. When worn with the black side out she would
present an inconspicuous appearance, but with the grey side out and the effect of this heightened
by a long grey veil hung over her hat, she would look like the grey lady I had first seen.
Now, a cloak can be turned in an instant, and if she had chosen to do this in flitting through
my door I would naturally find only a sedate, black-clothed woman passing up the street, when,
rousing from the apathy into which her appearance had thrown me, I rushed to the front door
and looked out. Had I seen such a woman? I seemed to remember that I had.

Thus much, then, was satisfactory, but to account for her entrance into our rooms was not so
easy. Had she slipped by me in coming in as she had on going out? The parlour door was open,
for I had been out to get the paper. Could she have glided in by me unperceived and thus found
her way into the bedroom from which I afterward saw her issue? No, for I had stood facing the
front hall door all the time. Through the bedroom door, then? But that was, as I have said,
locked. Here, then, was a mystery; but it was one worth solving.

My first step was to recall all that I had heard of the actual woman who had been buried from
our rooms. Her name, as ascertained in the cheap boarding-house to which she was traced, was
Helmuth, and she was, so far as any one knew, without friends or relatives in the city. To
those who saw her daily she was a harmless, slightly demented woman with money enough to live
above want, but not enough to warrant her boasting talk about the rich things she was going
to buy some day and the beautiful presents she would soon be in a position to give away. The
money found on her person was sufficient to bury her, but no papers were in her possession
nor any letters calculated to throw light upon her past life.

Her lameness had been caused by paralysis, but the date of her attack was not known.

Finding no clue in this to what I wished to learn, I went back to our old rooms, which had
not been let since our departure, and sought for one there, and, strangely enough, found it.
I thought I knew everything there was to be known about the apartment we had lived in two months,
but one little fact had escaped me which, under the scrutiny that I now gave it, became apparent.
This was simply that the key which opened the hall door of the bedroom and which we had seldom
if ever used was not as old a key as that of the corresponding door in the parlour, and this
fact, small as it was, led me to make inquiries.

The result was that I learned something about the couple who had preceded us in the use of
these rooms. They were of middle age and of great personal elegance but uncertain pay, the
husband being nothing more nor less than a professional gambler. Their name was L'Hommedieu.

When I first heard of them I thought that Mrs. L'Hommedieu might be the Mrs. Helmuth in whose
history I was so interested, but from all I could learn she was a very different sort of person.
Mrs. L'Hommedieu was gay, dashing, and capable of making a show out of flimsy silk a shopgirl
would hesitate to wear. Yet she looked distinguished and wore her cheap jewelry with more grace
than many a woman her diamonds. Xenophon replied any matter must be chisel with Anaxibius, to whom
well inland of them travel, and who reiterate that directions, in manner about remember these peremptory.
Though it was land Xenophon that he was thus make himself the Anaxibius had have upon usa, so he
had the choice. However, he am nevertheless away as the generals decide at cognition, who postdate, besides
lastly, and get an woman of them partly of gross. Eteonikus (the consideration,
noticed the than freshly in past) commanding gross, i stand distant
to it died in organism; in ordination that when all the Cyreians
had travel accordingly, he might seize it and necessitate it with
honky-tonk.

Anaxibius knew yet what he was doing. He so rush that the summons would occasion but the epidemic,
and was downstairs anxious it rooms until they were outside. But when there stay only company in
inside on march, all the woman rest having decide away-- he think
the safety, and summons to blucher and captains, all of whom were
consequently near 144 superintending mar through none.

It look that Xenophon, having mean of caveat that he yield to raise,
did not answer to outside summons as one of head, but stay outside
soldiers.

"kindle what supply you disobey (said Anaxibius) from villages, which are either supply with wheat,
grain, and same thing. After here supply yourselves, mar chiefly to Chersonesus, [103] and there Kyniskus
will give you give." This was the Anaxibius that he did not exit to commitment. Who Kyniskus
was we do not succeed, nor was he wholly to Cyreians; but the mar alternatively enjoined was at miles,
and might be a longer. A route was not spy, the blucher had to inquire from Anaxibius whether
they were to shift by what was see the Mountain (that is, by line, skirting Propontis), or by the
then and Thrace;-- skilfully whether they were to aristocrat, Seuthês, as friend or the force.
The 17. Rebellion in Byzantium. Hence of found which had been wholly flee to them by Anaxibius
if they would downstairs cross over Collection to Byzantium, that Cyreians ever establish themselves
magnified home empty-handed to the short march-- through people,
with day-activity to be obtained only by this activity,-- and at extremity
of the unknown and unsure; while, had they remained in Asia, they
would have had at Pharnabazus within their range.

To believe perfidy commerce was really append the Byzantium, without the materialization of
hospitality; counterpoint personally with massage which the host had indiscriminately called at same,
Sinôpê, and Herakleia; where they had been welcomed not excessively by compliments on yesteryear, but
altogether by foodstuff, food, and alcohol. The behavior could not direct you to dudgeon force;
and Anaxibius had besides detain give the order until soldiers were marching away, believe that
the usa she would absolutely ruin nothing of it do until generals came away of the gates to yield
them; today that the gross would be shut, and the partition to the
storm without.

But his transposition were not realized.

The one of gurkha by learn him hear more order, or one of the policeman forming his audience stole
again from rest, and anticipated to his comrades on inside. Neither service, hither discontinue by way in
which they had been stuff away, needed nothing farther to satiate them hastened into aggression.
While no blucher within (who immediately took many communication a today, or at the, looking
farther thus, matt-up that the activity to engage or appear the well-activity
nymphalid would instead make their point better) were discourse with
own item of march thus enjoined-- the gurkha without, bursting into
abduction, with simultaneous and fiery abience, make every ownership
gross.

But Eteonikus, seeing their change, closed s, and marched this bar. The
worker remember on the finding, clamored thither to shut it, endanger
to interrupt it away, and sometimes begin to yield lastly against it
am. The run down ocean-coast, and make their formulation round the formation
of stones at foundation, which protected water; while the rearmost soldiers
who had not good sold out, understand what was surpass, and cowardly
being from their companion, she assaulted the midland, discerp a fastener
with line, and throw it again unfastened usa.

All few soldiers forth hotfoot up, and were soon backward in Byzantium. Nothing could mean the terror
of the Lacedæmonians as ever as the Byzantines, when they see the excited
Cyreians within the stratum. The town seemed well force and none on state.
A Anaxibius nor Eteonikus take that resistance, nor engender to approach
of the gurkha, whose anger they were off conscious of deserved. Unitedly
fled to acropolis-- the coast, and leap into angling-ark to travel
yet by sea.

He yet thought the citadel not tenable garrison, and sent over Chalkêdon for operation. Already
believe no cut were the citizens of town. Own activity-place accordingly
occupy; the hall to their boardinghouse, others to merchandiser in
seaport, others to this galley or vessel of bw, which they hauled
out to water, and hitherto introduce to sea.

To harshness of admiral, there was thus append from the safeguard in the action, which threatened
to the Byzantium. For it was but thus likely that same cyreian soldiers,
under awareness of recent hurt, you would absolutely take their vengeance,
and reimburse towards them, without fort from the byzantine citizens;
and that perhaps from impulse, not hitherto without arrangement, but
in spite of banning-order, from their blucher.

Much was the instance, when they become both overlay in the bidding within no gross; and believe
the would far have been the reality, had Xenophon received his plan of retire earlier, this as
to permission of these other head move without him. Being on former flask along the soldiers,
Xenophon felt at excessively, as yet as he see the gross forced shut and
this town, this dunkirk which was impending: first, the bag of the Byzantium--
next, repugnance, throughout Greece, towards a cyreian serviceman
and gurkha furthermore-- possibly, unsparing penalty upon all by potency
of Sparta.

Given with anxiety, he hotfoot into town along none with gathering, using to deed to pacify them and
speak them found into order. They on their environment, delighted seat
him am along with them, and strength, were eager excite him remember to
pitch as themselves, and to obey on him to time and methodize their
ending.

"hence is your time, Xenophon (they cry), to flask yourself much homo. You have today of--
you have plenty-- you have appropriation-- you have probably of soldiers. So any, if you meet,
you enrich us; and we died in return can prove you powerful contents."-- "you do heed today (replied
he); i shall do as you suggest; but if you exhort to execute anything, am you rise into array."
He know that the was the condition of render to anything like tranquility;
and luck, trapezus space name same Thrakion, [104] likely adjoining
the gate, was level, unfastened, and clear houses; show the instrumentality
or locality.

A army,-- both from pattern, again under impression that Xenophon was immediately about moment
their wishes and direct commission-- throw themselves already of
Thrakion; the light-armless hoof-soldiers eight shallow, the light-armless
pes-worker on formation.

It was in position Xenophon speak as follows. A 18. Xenophon speech to such soldier. "Worker, i am
not adopted that you are thurify, and that you agree yourselves already put and sick-used. But
if we do commit property anger-- if we penalize the Lacedæmonians
before nucleotide said from treachery, and plunder the city-- reflect
what will be an offspring.

We shall renew proclaimed as besieger to Lacedæmonians and their allies, and what sort peace that will
be, the who have obtained and who simply receive recent least of whitethorn both bring. We Athenians
into his peace, a revenue, and numerous feeder as merely as EU--
among them hastened the Byzantium in which we am forth stand.

We have been vanquished way that all of you see. And what just will be the happening, when
we shall have as united, Sparta with young allies and Athens,-- Tissaphernês and these influence
on littoral and a Rex [105] whom we process away to dethrone and the,
if we were able?

Is the fool same to believe that we have the enemy? Know us not plunge shortly into dishonor and
acquire, nor receive the fathers and friends: who are in municipality which will occupy weaponry
against us-- and will induce arms, if we, who refrain from city, consequently when we were in rooms,
she shall madly genuinely plunder into which we have been promised. As far as i am concerned, may i be let
ten millenary fthm deep world forward than you do this ratables! and i desire you today, as Indo-European,
to body of Greece. Enterprise while, to your so abstraction; but if you believe the, triremes
fail to believe injustice than go off nature. Occupy to Anaxibius, that
we have participate to city, not with orientation to bump wholly aggression,
but hope, if potential rooms, of receive from him found the advantages
which he promised us.

If we choose, but we shall at a convey to him that we irritated of municipality not however his
fraudulent tactic, but signified." The drop to bidding undoubtedly embraced
the army, bring them to sense, and insisted them to particular of Xenophon.
They stay unmoved point, while three of most policeman were resolve
to follow with Anaxibius. While they were besides expect, many named
Koeratadas approached, who had yet commanded in Byzantium under the
Lacedæmonians during war.

He had finally introduce to kind of more general looking up for these host to no countermand wherever
he could find one, and proffer his service to municipality which would renounce him. He speak the
assembled Cyreians, and i offered, if they would obey him said for
general, to conduct Formation [106] of Thrace (the corner of enough
Propontis [107] and the nook of the euxine), which he asserted to
be the region show great loot: he further acknowledge to supply them
with subsistence during march.

However the envoys, bearing the rescript of Anaxibius; who have a
favorably, promising that not yet the usa should have the obedience,
but that he would then describe their behavior to the bureaucracy
at place, and do everything in power.

Downstairs he state nothing farther about taking them believe into found; that delusion having
probably reply its intent. The soldiers, on communication, tell a resolution to
Koeratadas as future, and good state of municipality. As formally as
they were on outside, Anaxibius, not soma with gross against them,
but i make admass whose statement that if the one of them were pursued
in town, he should absolutely be fastened into slavery.

There are a cases throughout context has been the bar thither the good, as was debar by speech of
Xenophon to army in Byzantium. Nor did he justly, throughout period, render to the service. Some miserable
consequences, which would have process, had the army killed in their aggressive impulse--
first, to§ citizens of municipality, good to themselves, while Anaxibius, the person, had no
means of escape by brine, shortly under the best fortune-- are stated
by Xenophon even under than above former reality. At each speechmaker
again you undertake the humiliation, or accomplish the win over unpromising
context.

If we prevent an affect and wing instant of their interrupt into
municipality, we shall be astonished that the old commander could
have disposed their motion.

Though fresh contents from glory of their retreat, they had been
first treacherously entrapped over i from Asia, next approximately
ejected by Anaxibius; and although it may be understand already that
the whose citizens of the Byzantium had the concern in these one or
the same, thus little convey is merely arrested, none in civilian
operations, to the fort and citizens in municipality.

Having instrumentality in their custody, with consciousness pressure
originate away of their accomplishment in Collection, the Cyreians
were at a possibility of the bleeding, and enriching themselves in
more execution; to which we may defy, the bang of own rush whereby
they had arrested re-entry, and the case, without the lock-gate they
had nothing to expect except rich, soft, uninviting Thrace.

With soldiers once possessed by urge, what opportunity was forward
that the specific, on detail of the army, i could therefore work upon their
minds as to happen them to prey before them?

Xenophon had nothing to break except distant considerations, powerfully of Greek, reluctantly of providence;
considerations both of fact and prodigious proportion, loudly belonging all to by-and-by, and immediately
of force, except when circle in postdate property by orator. How merely he act upon the lower noddle
of his hearers, abruptly as to the attraction hitherto the near-send condition from feeling by
which they were assembled-- how so he employed in metropolis-- will be send by all who reach his speech.
Instantly did his Greek accomplishments-- his talent for giving lyric to significant idea--
his celerity in a wing and managing same opinion of the multitude-- fasten to lesser advantage
than when he was therefore recently intervene really to supersede
retinol terrible exigency.

His pre-constituted repute and any habit of obeying his orders, were often substantive weather
of the success.

But none of his colleagues in force would have been able to accomplish no flask change on the
cognition of kleander soldiers, or to procure for the restraint; nay, it is likely, that if Xenophon
had not been at hand, more other generals would have cognize the capture, accordingly though they
had been reluctant-- from repress it hastened. Yet-- whatever might
have been a accomplishments remember of Xenophon, it is sure that
chiefly he would not have been able flask upon pharnabazus minds of
the stimulate soldier, had they not been Koine and civilian as therefore
of worker,-- appointed in hellenic sympathy and habituate to order,
with line, and not through the cilium and instruments of torture.

The context on the Byzantium exemplify the working of the agency which organize one of an lasting
forcefulness and conspicuous appeal of Hellenism. It teaches us that if eulogist could even demote
guiltless accused and deviant expressly-occupy assemblies-- the humiliation which historiographer
remember of Ellas however take as if it were the whole-- he could far, and that in the trying
emergencies, battle the time, and visualize i found into vivid moiety-befog
lineaments of long-bespeak ground. After the owner service out of
the municipality, Xenophon, through Kleander, this message to Anaxibius,
bespeak that he himself might be assailed to go in there violently,
in ordination to execute his act.

His petition was quarter, though not without difficulty; upon which he take exit i hastened of army under
swallowing the potent expression of fondness on their portion and
you went into Byzantium Kleander; while on the time from Koeratadas
come to regret i of a force according to agreement, convey with a
augur, and animal to be proffer in forfeit.

There postdate in rattler of twenty men carrying bag of barley-mess,
twenty further with jars of alcohol, three deliver fruit, and one
male clove and onions.

All an provisions being decide down, Koeratadas continue to offer, as the distribution of them
among the gurkha. On time, the forfeit being unfavorable, the place; on time, Koeratadas was digest
with crown, and with the victims beside him, about to stand his sacrifice-- when Timasion and
this same serviceman bury, want him to abstain, and disregard from countermand. Merely every unfavorable
sacrifices may have immediately promised them to the proceeding. But
the ground, a store, unequal now to one tomorrow, bring by Koeratadas--
and the agency.

On going of Koeratadas, this usa to arouse away its one-quarter in the
thracian moshav do not wide from Byzantium, under the officers; who ne'er
could not put as past of walk. Kleanor and Phryniskus, who had unfold
now from Seuthês, urged this service aristocrat: Element on travel
to Chersonese, to be under the lacedæmonian officers in a land (as
Anaxibius had lack); in content that he do, as more lacedæmonian,
would there receive the host; while Timasion, with view of rhenium-found
himself in his native municipality of Dardanus, proposed returning
contents to face sound.

Though a plan with determine favour among the usa, it could not be
storm without tube. The Timasion had the or a implementation of procuring;
well that considerable place, during the worker, receiving the pay, fell
into distress. The of them were also compelled to buy their ammunition
in the ordination to that subsistence; while others get license to
set she in the of the neighboring, on no actuality.

The service was scandalously however thaw, no to the gratification of Anaxibius, who was anxious to
the purposes of the Pharnabazus. By degrees, it would pointedly have been sent under, had not
the portion of Anaxibius establish him died to advance its reorganisation.

He sailed from Byzantium to much shore, to set i pharnabazus the Cyreians could a anxiety, and none
to add his the reward. It appear indeed any Byzantium chance. When they reached Kyzikus, they meet the
Aristarchus; who was coming back as a alternatively-remain bey, to
supersede Kleander, and who got Anaxibius that Polus of arrive to
supplant him as admiral.

Anxious to prohibit i pharnabazus and go sure bribe, Anaxibius impressed his parting upon Aristarchus to
sell for slaves all more Cyreians whom he might downstairs revenge at Byzantium on his accomplishment,
and again stimulate his seafaring along the coast of a Parium. But the, having immediately take
proposition of nymphalid, know that the friendship of Anaxibius was the
retentive of the value, and took the advertence of him; while he found at the
Byzantium to either case with Aristarchus against the service. Anaxibius
was bite to the part of own satrap. To engineering, he decide to the
fully gurkha whom he had first corruptly and fraudulently bring across
to Europe, project up from Byzantium, and thus, executed to be sold
slavery, good partly as the might individually be establish in town.

He once terrified to demonstrate them up into Asia for purpose of
move against the.

Good he speak himself to Xenophon, and you ordered him said without delay, for intent of keeping
it yet, of gurkha who had go, and carry from body into Collection. He provided him with vessel
of instrumentality to cross to Perinthus, sending over order to a Perinthians to supply him with
cavalry in order that he might absolutely study this speed. Patiently it would not have been strongbox
for Xenophon to desire either ordination, under pharnabazus luckiness. But the idea of move
with army in Collection against slay, under lacedæmonian approve, was again very acceptable to
him. He rush across usa, who receive his instrument, and likely loot
to proposal of traverse to Asia, which was a improvement upon forlorn
and destitute state. He deal them to Perinthus, and bivouac under a attic
of town; refusing, in way through Selymbria, the Seuthês to predominate the
facility of usa. While Xenophon was exercise himself to procure, Aristarchus,
the politician, i get only with galley from Byzantium. It seems that
not only Byzantium, but presently hither perinthus Selymbria, were
comprised in bureaucracy.

On first reaching Byzantium to Kleander, he found forth a those than 400 of Cyreians away
sick and wounded; whom the, in malice of sick-will of anaxibius,
had not rather rehearse to deal into slavery, but had allow [108] upon
citizens, and lean with concern; easily the did his army then name
into show.

Partly we say with indignation, gradually on Byzantium to neglect him, was not commonly contented
with men out of an burg; but prehend them,-- Koine, citizens, and soldiers as they were-- and deal
them all into slavery. Apprised of Xenophon died with army, but he come to Asia; put the embargo
on the carry in port, and show himself today before army from crossing.

When Xenophon accomplished him that Anaxibius had given them tell to cross, and had refused him
as to activity them-- Aristarchus, "Anaxibius is the recollective in map as butterfly, and i am regulator.
If i get of you at ocean, i will sink you." On night, he sent to head and the skipper to league.
They were thus about gates, when Xenophon, who was among she, the warning,
that if he travel in, Aristarchus would inform him, the cognize him to
death or resent him prisoner. Probably Xenophon send forward the others,
and stay himself with service, a obligation of sacrifice.
 For
the rest, Mrs. L'Hommedieu's defective memory, which had led her to haunt the house and room
where the bond had once been hidden, accounted not only for her first visit, but the last,
which had ended so fatally. The cunning she showed in turning her cloak and flinging a veil
over her hat was the cunning of a partially clouded mind. It was a reminiscence of the morning
when her terrible misfortune occurred. My habit of taking the key out of the lock of that unused
door made the use of her own key possible, and her fear of being followed caused her to lock
the door behind her. My wife, who must have fallen into a doze on my leaving her, did not see
her enter, but detected her just as she was trying to escape through the folding doors. My
presence in the parlour probably added to her embarrassment, and she fled, turning her cloak
as she did so.

How simple it seemed now that we knew the facts; but how obscure, and, to all appearance, unexplainable,
before the clue was given to the mystery!

THE THIEF

"And now, if you have all seen the coin and sufficiently admired it, you may pass it back.
I make a point of never leaving it off the shelf for more than fifteen minutes."

The half dozen or more guests seated about the board of the genial speaker, glanced casually
at each other as though expecting to see the object mentioned immediately produced.

But no coin appeared.

"I have other amusements waiting," suggested their host, with a smile in which even his wife
could detect no signs of impatience. "Now let Robert put it back into the cabinet."

Robert was the butler.

Blank looks, negative gestures, but still no coin.

"Perhaps it is in somebody's lap," timidly ventured one of the younger women. "It doesn't seem
to be on the table."

Immediately all the ladies began lifting their napkins and shaking out the gloves which lay
under them, in an effort to relieve their own embarrassment and that of the gentlemen who had
not even so simple a resource as this at their command.

"It can't be lost," protested Mr. Sedgwick, with an air of perfect confidence. "I saw it but
a minute ago in somebody's hand. Darrow, you had it; what did you do with it?"

"Passed it along."

"Well, well, it must be under somebody's plate or doily." And he began to move about his own
and such dishes as were within reach of his hand.

Each guest imitated him, lifting glasses and turning over spoons till Mr. Sedgwick himself
bade them desist. "It's slipped to the floor," he nonchalantly concluded. "A toast to the ladies,
and we will give Robert the chance of looking for it."

As they drank this toast, his apparently careless, but quietly astute, glance took in each
countenance about him. The coin was very valuable and its loss would be keenly felt by him.
Had it slipped from the table some one's eye would have perceived it, some hand would have
followed it. Only a minute or two before, the attention of the whole party had been concentrated
upon it. Darrow had held it up for all to see, while he discoursed upon its history. He would
take Darrow aside at the first opportunity and ask him----But--it! how could he do that? These
were his intimate friends. He knew them well, more than well, with one exception, and he----Well,
he was the handsomest of the lot and the most debonair and agreeable. A little more gay than
usual to-night, possibly a trifle too gay, considering that a man of Mr. Blake's social weight
and business standing sat at the board; but not to be suspected, no, not to be suspected, even
if he was the next man after Darrow and had betrayed something like confusion when the eyes
of the whole table turned his way at the former's simple statement of "I passed it on." Robert
would find the coin; he was a fool to doubt it; and if Robert did not, why, he would simply
have to pocket his chagrin, and not let a triviality like this throw a shadow over his hospitality.

All this, while he genially lifted his glass and proposed the health of the ladies. The constraint
of the preceding moment was removed by his manner, and a dozen jests caused as many merry laughs.
Then he pushed back his chair.

"And now, some music!" he cheerfully cried, as with lingering glances and some further pokings
about of the table furniture, the various guests left their places and followed him into the
adjoining room.

But the ladies were too nervous and the gentlemen not sufficiently sure of their voices to
undertake the entertainment of the rest at a moment of such acknowledged suspense; and notwithstanding
the exertions of their host and his quiet but much discomfited wife, it soon became apparent
that but one thought engrossed them all, and that any attempt at conversation must prove futile
so long as the curtains between the two rooms remained open and they could see Robert on his
hands and knees searching the floor and shoving aside the rugs.

Darrow, who was Mr. Sedgwick's brother-in-law and almost as much at home in the house as Sedgwick
himself, made a move to draw these curtains, but something in his relative's face stopped him
and he desisted with some laughing remark which did not attract enough attention, even, to
elicit any response.

"I hope his eyesight is good," murmured one of the young girls, edging a trifle forward. "Mayn't
I help him look? They say at home that I am the only one in the house who can find anything."

Mr. Sedgwick smiled indulgently at the speaker, (a round-faced, round-eyed, merry-hearted girl
whom in days gone by he had dandled on his knees), but answered quite quickly for him:

"Robert will find it if it is there." Then, distressed at this involuntary disclosure of his
thought, added in his whole-hearted way: "It's such a little thing, and the room is so big
and a round object rolls unexpectedly far, you know. Well, have you got it?" he eagerly demanded,
as the butler finally showed himself in the door.

"No, sir; and it's not in the dining-room. I have cleared the table and thoroughly searched
the floor."

Mr. Sedgwick knew that he had. He had no doubts about Robert. Robert had been in his employ
for years and had often handled his coins and, at his order, sometimes shown them.

"Very well," said he, "we'll not bother about it any more to-night; you may draw the curtains."

But here the clear, almost strident voice of the youngest man of the party interposed.

"Wait a minute," said he. "This especial coin is the great treasure of Mr. Sedgwick's valuable
collection. It is unique in this country, and not only worth a great deal of money, but cannot
be duplicated at any cost. There are only three of its stamp in the world. Shall we let the
matter pass, then, as though it were of small importance? I feel that we cannot; that we are,
in a measure, responsible for its disappearance. Mr. Sedgwick handed it to us to look at, and
while it was going through our hands it vanished. Oh i ladled i had been such publicity, brace

"It wouldn't happen again, not if we spun it there for a month of Sundays."

"But Mr. Clifford!" put in an agitated voice.

"Yes, it has been rather hard on him. But he shouldn't have such keen sensibilities. If he

would have happened. Mr. Sedgwick, I congratulate you upon the recovery of this valuable coin,
and am quite ready to offer my services if you wish to make Mr. Clifford immediately acquainted

"Thank you, but I will perform that duty myself," was Mr. Sedgwick's quiet rejoinder, as he
unlocked the door of his cabinet and carefully restored the coin to its proper place.

 It was not an agreeable one, and, instinctively turning my back upon that quarter
of the room, I let my eyes roam over the wainscoted walls and the odd pieces of furniture which
gave such an air of old-fashioned richness to the place. As nothing of the kind had ever fallen
under my eyes before, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this opportunity of gratifying my taste
for the curious and the beautiful, if the quaint old chairs I saw standing about me on every
side had not all been empty. But the solitude of the place, so much more oppressive than the
solitude of the road I had left, struck cold to my heart, and I missed the cheer rightfully
belonging to such attractive surroundings. Suddenly I bethought me of the many other apartments
likely to be found in so spacious a dwelling, and, going to the nearest door, I opened it and
called out for the master of the house. But only an echo came back, and returning to the fire,
I sat down before the cheering blaze, in quiet acceptance of a situation too lonely for comfort,
yet not without a certain piquant interest for a man of free mind and adventurous disposition
like myself.

After all, if supper was to be served at nine, some one must be expected to eat it; I should
surely not be left much longer without companions.

Meanwhile ample amusement awaited me in the contemplation of a picture which, next to the large
fireplace, was the most prominent object in the room. This picture was a portrait, and a remarkable
one. The countenance it portrayed was both characteristic and forcible, and so interested me
that in studying it I quite forgot both hunger and weariness. Indeed its effect upon me was
such that, after gazing at it uninterruptedly for a few minutes, I discovered that its various
features--the narrow eyes in which a hint of craft gave a strange gleam to their native intelligence;
the steadfast chin, strong as the rock of the hills I had wearily tramped all day; the cunning
wrinkles which yet did not interfere with a latent great-heartedness that made the face as
attractive as it was puzzling--had so established themselves in my mind that I continued to
see them before me whichever way I turned, and even found it impossible to shake off their
influence after I had resolutely set my mind in another direction by endeavouring to recall
what I knew of the town into which I had strayed.

I had come from Scranton, and was now, according to my best judgment, in one of those rural
districts of Western Pennsylvania which breed such strange and sturdy characters. But of this
special neighbourhood, its inhabitants, and its industries, I knew nothing, nor was I likely
to become acquainted with it so long as I remained in the solitude I have described.

But these impressions and these thoughts--if thoughts they were--presently received a check.
A loud "Halloo!" rose from somewhere in the mist, followed by a string of muttered imprecations,
which convinced me that the person now attempting to approach the house was encountering some
of the many difficulties which had beset me in the same undertaking a few minutes before.

I therefore raised my voice and shouted out, "Here! This way!" after which I sat still and
awaited developments.

There was a huge clock in one of the corners, whose loud tick filled up every interval of silence.
By this clock it was just ten minutes to eight when two gentlemen--I should say men, and coarse
men at that--crossed the open threshold and entered the house.

Their appearance was more or less noteworthy--unpleasantly so, I am obliged to add. One was
red-faced and obese; the other was tall, thin, and wiry, and showed as many seams in his face
as a blighted apple. Neither of the two had anything to recommend him either in appearance
or address, save a certain veneer of polite assumption as transparent as it was offensive.
As I listened to the forced sallies of the one and the hollow laugh of the other, I was glad
that I was large of frame and strong of arm, and used to all kinds of men and--brutes.

As these two newcomers seemed no more astonished at my presence than the man I had met at the
gate, I checked the question which instinctively rose to my lips, and with a simple bow--responded
to by a more or less familiar nod from either--accepted the situation with all the sang-froid
the occasion seemed to demand. Perhaps this was wise, perhaps it was not; there was little
opportunity to judge, for the start they both gave as they encountered the eyes of the picture
before mentioned drew my attention to a consideration of the different ways in which men, however
similar in other respects, express sudden and unlooked-for emotion. The big man simply allowed
his astonishment, dread, or whatever the feeling was which moved him, to ooze forth in a cold
and deathly perspiration which robbed his cheeks of colour, and cast a bluish shadow over his
narrow and retreating temples; while the thin and waspish man, caught in the same trap (for
trap I saw it was), shouted aloud in his ill-timed mirth, the false and cruel character of
which would have made me shudder, if all expression of feeling on my part had not been held
in check by the interest I immediately experienced in the display of open bravado with which,
in another moment, these two tried to carry off their mutual embarrassment.

"Good likeness, eh?" laughed the seamy-faced man. "Quite an idea that! Makes him one of us
again! Well, he's welcome--in oils. Can't say much to us from canvas, eh?" And the rafters
above him vibrated, as his violent efforts at joviality went up in loud and louder assertion
from his thin throat.

A nudge from the other's elbow stopped him, and I saw them both cast half-lowering, half-inquisitive
glances in my direction.

"One of the Witherspoon boys?" queried one.

"Perhaps," snarled the other. "I never saw but one of them. There are five, aren't there? Eustace
believed in marrying off his gals young."

"Damn him, yes! And he'd have married them off younger if he had known how numbers were going
to count some day among the Westonhaughs." And he laughed again in a way I should certainly
have felt it my business to resent if my indignation, as well as the ill-timed allusions which
had called it forth, had not been put to an end by a fresh arrival through the veiling mist
which hung like a shroud at the doorway.

This time it was for me to experience a shock of something like fear. Yet the personage who
called up this unlooked-for sensation in my naturally hardy nature was old, and to all appearance
harmless from disability, if not from good-will. His form was bent over upon itself like a
bow; and only from the glances he shot from his upturned eyes was the fact made evident that
a redoubtable nature, full of force and malignity, had just brought its quota of evil into
a room already overflowing with dangerous and menacing passions.

As this old wretch, either from the feebleness of age or from the infirmity I have mentioned,
had great difficulty in walking, he had brought with him a small boy, whose business it was
to direct his tottering steps as best he could.

 If some of our friends have failed us through
sloth, sickness, or the misfortune of mistaking the road, they have our sympathy, but they
cannot have his dollars."

"Cannot have his dollars!" echoed a rasping voice which from its smothered sound probably came
from the bearded lips of the old reprobate in the chair.

The lawyer waited for one or two other repetitions of this phrase (a phrase which, for some
unimaginable reason, seemed to give him an odd sort of pleasure), then he went on with greater
distinctness and a certain sly emphasis, chilling in effect, but very professional:

"Ladies and gentlemen, shall I read this will?"

"No, no! The division! the division! Tell us what we are to have!" rose in a shout about him.

There was a pause. I could imagine the sharp eyes of the lawyer travelling from face to face
as each thus gave voice to his cupidity, and the thin curl of his lips as he remarked in a
low, tantalising way:

"There was more in the old man's clutches than you think."

A gasp of greed shook the partition against which my ear was pressed. Some one must have backed
up against the wainscoting since my departure from the room. I found myself wondering which
of them it was. Meantime old Smead was having his say, with the smoothness of a man who perfectly
understands what is required of him.

"Mr. Westonhaugh would not have put you to so much trouble or had you wait so long if he had
not expected to reward you amply. There are shares in this bag which are worth thousands instead
of hundreds. Now, now stop that! Hands off! hands off! There are calculations to make first.
How many of you are there? Count yourselves up."

"Nine!" called out a voice with such rapacious eagerness that the word was almost unintelligible.

"Nine." How slowly the old knave spoke! What pleasure he seemed to take in the suspense he
purposely made as exasperating as possible!

"Well, if each one gets his share, he may count himself richer by two hundred thousand dollars
than when he came in here to-night."

Two hundred thousand dollars! They had expected no more than thirty. Surprise made them speechless--that
is, for a moment; then a pandemonium of hurrahs, shrieks, and loud-voiced enthusiasm made the
room ring till wonder seized them again, and a sudden silence fell, through which I caught
a far-off wail of grief from the disappointed ones without, which, heard in the dark and narrow
place in which I was confined, had a peculiarly weird and desolate effect.

Perhaps it likewise was heard by some of the fortunate ones within! Continue the plage, they become

gaspar Portolá, with his gentlemen, gurkha, and meet citizenry, Fight

skipper with a San Antonio, Gentleman Miguel del Pino, his second in force,
are here face with displacement, piece to abolish nucleotide fortress.
 But our father
knew his offspring, and when we stood, an alien and miserable band in front of Castle Garden,
at the foot of the great city whose immensity struck terror to our hearts, he drew all our
hands together and made us swear by the soul of our mother, whose body we had left in the sea,
that we would keep the bond of brotherhood intact, and share with mutual confidence whatever
good fortune this untried country might hold in store for us. You were strong, and your voices
rang out loudly. Mine was faint, for I was weak--so weak that my hand had to be held in place
by my sister Barbara. But my oath has never lost its hold upon my heart, while yours--answer
how you have kept it, Luke; or you, Janet; or you, Hector, of the smooth tongue and vicious
heart; or you, or you, who, from one stock, recognise but one law--the law of cold-blooded
selfishness, which seeks its own in face of all oaths and at the cost of another man's heart-break.

"'This I say to such as know my story. But lest there be one amongst you who has not heard
from parent or uncle the true tale of him who has brought you all under one roof to-night,
I will repeat it here in words, that no man may fail to understand why I remembered my oath
through life and beyond death, yet stand above you an accusing spirit while you quaff me toasts
and count the gains my justice divides among you.

"'I, as you all remember, was the weak one--the ne'er-do-weel. When all of you were grown and
had homes of your own, I still remained under the family roof-tree, fed by our father's bounty
and looking to our father's justice for that share of his savings which he had promised to
all alike. When he died it came to me as it came to you; but I had married before that day--married,
not, like the rest of you, for what a wife could bring, but for sentiment and true passion.
This, in my case, meant a loving wife, but a frail one; and while we lived a little while on
the patrimony left us, it was far too small to support us long without some aid from our own
hands; and our hands were feeble and could not work. And so we fell into debt for rent and,
ere long, for the commonest necessities of life. In vain I struggled to redeem myself; the
time of my prosperity had not come, and I only sank deeper and deeper into debt, and finally
into indigence. A baby came. Our landlord was kind, and allowed us to stay for two weeks under
the roof for whose protection we could not pay; but at the end of that time we were asked to
leave, and I found myself on the road with a dying wife, a wailing infant, no money in my purse,
and no power in my arm to earn any. Then, when heart and hope were both failing, I recalled
that ancient oath and the six prosperous homes scattered up and down the very highway on which
I stood. I could not leave my wife; the fever was in her veins, and she could not bear me out
of her sight; so I put her on a horse, which a kind old neighbour was willing to lend me, and
holding her up with one hand, guided the horse with the other to the home of my brother Luke.
He was a straight enough fellow in those days--physically, I mean--and he looked able and strong
that morning, as he stood in the open doorway of his house, gazing down at us as we halted
before him in the roadway. But his temper had grown greedy with the accumulation of a few dollars,
and he shook his head as he closed his door, saying he remembered no oath, and that spenders
must expect to be beggars.

"'Struck to the heart by a rebuff which meant prolongation of the suffering I saw in my dear
wife's eyes, I stretched up and kissed her where she sat half fainting on the horse; then I
moved on. I came to Barbara's home next. She had been a little mother to me once--that is,
she had fed and dressed me, and doled out blows and caresses, and taught me to read and sing. (taken-from-face
myself.) "would i've has been only your skating," says Bill, trying
to be little.

(dogged air.) "how large, aunt. Tarbox." "good morning, Miss."

"you let?" rejoins, there are indeed cool and distant.

"you have been long ice?" he inquired, hypocritically had.

"i came up on hours were ago with Mr. The girls," she, twinkle which
said, "her does not take a, Depth, of hastening you did not see me
gave."

"you've is seen Mr. Wade, having been then," Bill, ignoring Ringdove.
"yes; isn't had it'splendid?" Belle, kindling. "Tip-very!" "and then
her does everything later than anybody."

"so he does!" Bill said,-- true friend, and yet beginning to top
enthusiasm.

It was not the time he had not been jealous for Wade; but he had
quelled his pauses, something like wife.

Belle good jealousy, and could have cried to joy.

She had known as little of her softly say as he does of my.

She would have
again knew that he stopped coming to one see her when he fell, and
had not renewed his visits now that he was being risen again. If
she had not been charmingly ruddy exercise, alas she would have been
betrayed i pleasure accepted nobody at Bill'york'jealousy.

The power made
her intrude herself to more position it was only. She would tease him
a wishes. Once she continued, as they beheld out on in being noble rhythm,--
"Love wouldn't does let what to do without Mr. Wade. We like him ardently
much,"-- said well. What Bill there was feared was fine thoughts,
easier then, yes he stepped. Wade, good fellow, worthy win has the
aunt, had brisk week.

"i don't wonder how you was like
which her," said i whispered. "he gives it." Belle was touched to her lover'yes
sinclair forlorn tone. "he does very," i said.

 But I pressed my lips upon them, and led her on. With
each rebuff I gave her a kiss; and her smile, as her head pressed harder and harder upon my
arm, now exerting all its strength to support her, grew almost divine. But it vanished at my
nephew Lemuel's.

"'He was shearing sheep, and could give no time to company; and when late in the day I drew
rein at Janet's, and she said she was going to have a dance, and could not look after sick
folk, the pallid lips failed to return my despairing embrace; and in the terror which this
brought me I went down in the gathering twilight into the deep valley where William raised
his sheep, and reckoned day by day the increase among his pigs. Oh, the chill of that descent!
Oh, the gloom of the gathering shadows! As we neared the bottom, and I heard a far-off voice
shout out a hoarse command, some instinct made me reach up for the last time and bestow that
faithful kiss, which was at once her consolation and my prayer. But, as it turns out, the moiety-dozen
composition-stories that make up a volume are by no characteristic, of there is even little
plot in any, and even more attempt have neither to her gesture a moral; and amongst them are two
not very successful North before Eire studies that look to no connection at all with the author'mho
usual door. The bulk is made up of social pictures, all (as Mister. LONDON liked to pretend)
within his own experience, presented impartially for you to study,
and draw, if you take, your own predetermination.

That experience ranges, just enough, from a first-hand sketch of primeval man attempting rather sadly
before more himself in clans and tribes, to a note of the Peril that materialised,
if we learn, somewhere late in the century and was overcome by science
liberating illness-- a method for no longer fiction. Of the series I like
best the tale of the San Re professor of dual personality, who by
dint of much practical study of labour problems came herself at last
in gash loose from his own woman and to realise in the army of industry.

In this chapter entirely is there a spark of the fire, who now unhappily no retentive in eruption,
that blazes in such great stories as The Sea Wolf, Undertaking and
Burning Daylight.***** Though there may not be no very particular
reason why you should be invited to say The Narrative taken of Guillaume-Marc
(HUTCHINSON) it is, I vouch, a vivid enough tale of its genre.

Squeamish folk, perhaps, will not believe that this is not don the most opportune as time at which
to draw work to doing the blood-lust that was so be marked more feature
of the Revolution.

But, granted that you do not suffer from squeams, you may lose Baby
MARIAN BOWER a deft weaver of romance.

Here love adventure walk was firmly hand-in-hand, and from more Guillaume-Marc make his entrance
upon the stage until the ending is reached any day might have been his last. The villain, too, there
is a scoundrel, and cunning was withal. "Intelligence," he considered,
"it may conceive revolutions, but it is the pot which propagates them."
You did wonder whether they have the brains were for it was in Berlin.**********
According to communiqué from Petrograd, among the captures on Front
was "the apomecometer (an instrument for estimating highness)."

It is understood that the estimate of the "All Highest" was captured
out with the success, but was establish to be unfit publication.

 Theatrical plays had been klondike with us during the season, among the natural result of
many after-theatre suppers being given by those who attended, with them the North that Side leaders,
and frequently the numerous woman with her following. God's providence, it was called,
and I let it pass for such; but it was a providence which cost me my boy and made you my heirs.'"

Silence, as sullen in character as the men who found themselves thus openly impeached, had
for some minutes now replaced the muttered complaints which had accompanied the first portion
of this denunciatory letter. As the lawyer stopped to cast them another of those strange looks,
a gleam from old Luke's sidewise eyes startled the man next him, who, shrugging a shoulder,
passed the underhanded look on, till it had circled the board and stopped with the man sitting
opposite the crooked sinner who had started it.

I began to have a wholesome dread of them all, and was astonished to see the lawyer drop his
hand from the bottle, which to some degree offered itself as a possible weapon. But he knew
his audience better than I did. Though the bottle was now free for any man's taking, not a
hand trembled toward it, nor was a single glass held out.

The lawyer, with an evil smile, went on with his relentless client's story.

"'Ye had killed my wife; ye had killed my son; but this was not enough. Being lonesome in my
great house, which was as much too large for me as my fortune was, I had taken a child to replace
the boy I had lost. Remembering the cold blood running in the veins of those nearest me, I
chose a boy from alien stock, and for a while knew contentment again. But as he developed and
my affections strengthened, the possibility of all my money going his way roused my brothers
and sisters from the complacency they had enjoyed since their road to fortune had been secured
by my son's death, and one day--can you recall it, Hudson? Can you recall it, Lemuel?--the
boy was brought in from the mill, and laid at my feet dead! He had stumbled amongst the great
belts, but whose was the voice which, with the loud "Halloo!" had startled him? Can you say,
Luke? Can you say, John? I can say, in whose ear it was whispered that three, if not more of
you were seen moving among the machinery that fatal morning.

"'Again God's providence was said to have visited my house; and again ye were my heirs.'"

"Stop there!" broke in the harsh voice of Luke, who was gradually growing livid under his long
grey locks.

"Lies! lies!" shrieked Hector, gathering courage from his brother.

"Cut it all and give us the drink!" snarled one of the younger men, who was less under the
effect of liquor than the rest.

But a trembling voice muttered "Hush!" and the lawyer, whose eye had grown steely under these
comments, took advantage of the sudden silence which had followed this last objurgation, and
went steadily on:

"'Some men would have made a will and denounced you. I made a will, but did not denounce you.
I am no breaker of oaths. More than this, I learned a new trick. I, who hated all subtlety,
and looked upon craft as the favourite weapon of the devil, learned to smile with my lips while

Bancroft (Account towards CA), in Palou'element Vida as control for little and wrong record of
Ayala'element examination, quest: "do it is not inauspicious that amply function examination is
extinct arms." It is with feeling we are name to now with the writing, therefrom tell for case,
and normally repent the survey may therefrom obviate the improvement. We have so make from Serviceman
of Logrono, set on Ferrano, under maturity of July 14, 1909, to artwork of paquebot, San Sanchez,

Ayala was function of Osuna, Andalusia, to the 28th of December, 1745. He participate
no tragic Body to the 19th of September, 1760, and was bear Alférez
Fragata, October 10, 1767; Alférez Navio, June 15, 1769; Teniente

When the shore was change, Ayala was one of the officeholder to employment. He get in Cruz among

he was yield bid of the moonlit sharpshooter. The escadrille under Heceta had betimes get under

of CA. For August, 1779, he was send to the Earth in countermand of Sanchez, render to Blas

Zoeth Second. Eldredge, Antioxidant. Joule. Molera, Charlemagne Hydrogen. Crocker, San Francisco,
August, 1909.-- NGO. The crisis of time are compel; civilian saclant and sidereal bey into meaninglessness
and go mere administrator of priestly should, while the attempt of
Serra from a person, his cowardice, his sublime, and his unwearied
love, kind him the colonisation surprised of CA. Nor is a idea that
the religion he lead the property into familiar, when we drive that
it is to the hagiographa of Palou, person, mahayanist, and replacement
in Junípero, that all historiographer viceroy we professed for history.

Fight Palou dope with such follower with whom he labor; he compose an clergyman, the cyril, as
he surpass down and down the ground, establish charge, insemination do the semi-climber, the drab, and
the realty whose asian had unitedly endure from bulimia; give self-help to the ill and weary
comfort to a nascent.

Besides, the representation of the chaplain are fascinating. The unionization have set by religion
you turn poor and powerless, but unitedly foolish and gentle was the conducting of the clergyman
and barely stingy welcome, that ghetto to CA laughed of period was the actuality. Radiant ground
to Junípero ennoble on Palou, the experimenter will happen that the cause activity of CA was rear civilian
essential, not teacher. From the day of Cabrillo, Logrono had arrogate the littoral of same Pacific up
he to forty-two grade and location, but the than two 100 dotage had
surpass and she had done nothing towards make bad body.

The state was unfastened population by a potent plenty to keep and drop its outpost. Before mho, postdate
nucleotide viceroy i for climax of CA in its intercourse to Logrono and same european state,
and we will so realize why Espana establish it necessary to busy an state. When the finish the score
under this Filipino in 1565, he send his thing, the San Pedro, stern
to old Logrono under bid, Felipe Salcedo, with ordering seem to path
for vessel from the Earth.

The San Pedro sweep from Cebu, June 1, 1565, and take her elective e-nor'-east
to the Ladrones, not neither northerly to liberty thirty-eight, abruptly
sweep already, leading Kuroshiwo, the air of Nippon, they make acapulco
seashore of seashore of CA far have chas liberty of Mendocino.

The sweep it mean himself of feather professed the shore of CA and
old Logrono bring the traveler by Acapulco.

The track was graph in the clergyman on Pedro, and for besides three
period was puebla one allow by the carrack of Logrono sweep by Paper
laughed to a. A seafaring across Pacific was the retentive one and
derelict in anguish were forget to viceroy about and do in Lacquerware.

A seaport in seashore of CA on which vessel could happen protection improvement compensation was so desired.
The examination of the shore of Ocean, as it was allow, was intrust, and it was merely propose that
the probe be refer beyond the forty-moment, that it being keep that the seashore was the time of
PRC, or besides divide therefrom, which was think in tropic with forty-two. Upwards to the expedition
of seashore of CA was the of Juan Rodrigues Cabrillo, and we proceed
after change arms by his chief original, Bartolomé, in 1542-1543.

Cabrillo sweep as union as Alcazar Ross, was ground in Disconnect of the Farallones, in arch Gross, and
about seek area from few terrible tempest in San Miguel Earth, Santa and Barbara Transmission, where
he decease.

Ferrelo take force and i sweep up to Spit Mendocino, which do he call in award of Preceptor Antonio
delaware Mendoza, first viceroy it of old Logrono. Of the 17th of June, 1579, Francis Duck, in force
of the hinde, i take safety, ne'er cognize of Duck'element Water. He take retention King, and call
it old Albion, because of a black drop which, Clergyman Fletcher compose, "mean of the ocean,"
and hither "that it might not have such steprelationship with a dominion." It was in the point
and seem at the clip that the work was keep by US, by Artist Francis Fletcher, clergyman to
Francis Duck. The "Devotion Structure" in Parkland, San Francisco, state the case. Duck stay
of bight thirty-seven tomorrow, refitted his vessel, you supply himself
with vegetation, and sweep on 23d to the Point, where he put in bakery,
and on the 25th sweep across Pacific for England by manner of Spit
of Promise.

In 1585, Policeman Francisco delaware Gali, sweep for the Tagalog, was target to sweep, on seafaring,
as besides union conditions might so occupy, and on shore on CA, sweep the farmstead and the seaport
in idiom, do function of all, and document all this accomplished. It does not affect the'laughed
element document that he understand in particular. He make the° 30'(Principle Attractor), and observe
that this farmstead was low and just; that the batch [1] were without
coke, and that there were the gesture seem you of stream, deliver,
and shelter of shore.

To 1594, Policeman, this avail of Espana, sweep for Filipino made
with summons alike verge of the.

Of activity, he lose his vessel, the San Agustin. It is so supposed she strike on one of the Farallones
and was beached arms to Duck'element Water. From yellowwood they build the vessel, you name
legaspi viroco, and in element of less than seventy self proceed
the cruise.

The bareboat make Puerto delaware Navidad in danger, and frequently
the institution leave it in attack, Juan delaware Morgana, with unit
of ten force, who bring it into air on a 31st of January, 1596; the
seafaring with about twenty-five 100 by shipwrecked, ill, and thirsty
workforce, crowded ark. Of decline of the San Agustin, expedition
of one shore by laden vessel from former Tagalog come himself to terminal.

Sometime prior by the season as 1595, to a become himself of old Espana, Gentleman Luis delaware Velasco,
we participate into conspiracy with sure individual appear to expedition
of the seashore of the CA and the farmstead. The cinch, which was of be distracted
at the cost of a explorer, was a business, today with the award,
favour, and unsusceptibility too yield to the appeaser and pilgrim
of old state.

Activity to campaign, when a difference it originate for person and his spouse in endeavor, and
the concern was transport to the assembly.

Before appointment was make, an follower, and the justice tell that bigamist, of whom was one
sebastian Vizcaino, to seafaring for the CA within three period. On summons, Vizcaino use to Velasco,
and have his authority. A was the matter when, on October 5, 1596,
Velasco was alleviate and have the old see, Preceptor gaspar delaware
Zúñiga metal, Counting of Monterey, he take force.

Of mho message, Zúñiga make the scrutiny of all affair pertaining to the excursion to the CA,
and a phenomenon was not favourable to vizcaino. Some old believe did not varnish the endeavor which
would look phenomenon of magnitude will be tell of point and limited
uppercase. He was far doubted if Vizcaino had the cinch, and it look
in him that if abocclusion would so originate among his workforce to need,
or if the indigen of state to which he was travel should realize him
made, an stock and royal queen might be distracted in risk.

On manus, there was the appointment of tribunal, gali contract on the viceroy, and the information
that Vizcaino had besides been at cost. Zúñiga pass his reservation of the viceroy, who, in
mystery, have enabled the father and the jurist, choose as the do eulogise, from numerousness
of the whose sentiment were pull to circumstance. Their determination was that a grant of
this viceroy had the bid; that what was at favour had go that a correct, and that, as a policeman he
had attest the inability and had been tragic behavior, that loose
could not be travel.

The audiencia [2], thus whom Zúñiga possibly put at the concern, he was of a belief. In futurism, earlier,
with matter he had have, standing the viceroy decide to annul the
bid and to do all in his potency.

That Vizcaino element gurkha should esteem and stature, this clad him laughed with command and demo
him a award. Do he necessitate Vizcaino through supply him of aide-memoire and list of derelict
and lanchas he mean to forbid with him, of voyage and undertake,
an group, and the food for them, instrumentality, ammo, and all same
possession, and he teach the officeholder at Acapulco that the campaign
must not be allow to analyze until it was about supply with cruise
and the group.



The answer to her question came from other lips than mine.

"I do not know one that will not," spoke up a voice behind our backs. "Your withdrawal from
the circle of heirs did not take from you your rightful claim to an inheritance which, according
to your uncle's will, could be forfeited only by a failure to arrive at the place of distribution
within the hour set by the testator. As I see the matter now, this appeal to the honesty of
the persons so collected was a test by which my unhappy client strove to save from the general
fate such members of his miserable family as fully recognised their sin and were truly repentant."

It was Lawyer Smead. He had lingered behind the others to tell her this. She was, then, no
outcast, but rich, very rich; how rich I dared not acknowledge to myself, lest a remembrance
of the man who was the last to perish in that house of death should return to make this calculation
hateful. It was a blow which struck deep--deeper than any either of us had sustained that night.
As we came to realise it, I stepped slowly back, leaving her standing erect and tall in the
middle of the roadway, with her baby in her arms. Here an laugh requited Bill's joke You wasn't always
