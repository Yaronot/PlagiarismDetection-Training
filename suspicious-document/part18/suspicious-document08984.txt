PREFACE

In the preparation of this book the author has had in mind the needs of the upper grammar grades.
The subject matter has not been selected with the object of covering the field of Western geography
in a systematic manner, but instead the attempt has been made to picture as graphically as
may be some of its more striking and interesting physical features, and the influence which
these features have exerted upon its discovery and settlement.

Those subjects have been presented which have more than local interest and are illustrative
of world-wide principles. Clear conceptions of the earth and man's relation to it are not gained
by general statements as readily as by the comprehensive study of concrete examples.

Nowhere outside of the Cordilleran region are to be found so remarkable illustrations of the
growth and destruction of physical features, or so clear examples of the control which physical
features exercise over the paths of exploration, settlement, and industrial development.

The fact that the West furnishes a wealth of material for geography teaching has long been
recognized in a general way, although there has been but little attempt to present this material
in a form suitable for the use of schools.

The illustrations are, with few exceptions, from the author's own photographs, and the descriptions
are made up from his personal observations. Since the illustrations are numerous and have been
selected with much care, it is hoped that they will add greatly to the value of the text. They
should be used, and a proper understanding of the pictures made a part of every lesson.

THE WORK OF THE COLORADO RIVER

The Colorado River is not old, as we estimate the age of rivers. It was born when the Rocky
Mountains were first uplifted to the sky, when their lofty peaks, collecting the moisture of
the storms, sent streams dashing down to the plains below. Upon the western slope of the mountains
a number of these streams united in one great river, which wound here and there, seeking the
easiest route across the plateau to the Gulf of California.

At first the banks of the river were low, and its course was easily turned one way or another.
From the base of the mountains to the level of the ocean there is a fall of more than a mile,
so that the river ran swiftly and was not long in making for itself a definite channel.

Many thousands of years passed. America was discovered. The Spaniards conquered Mexico and
sent expeditions northward in search of the cities of Cibola, where it was said that gold and
silver were abundant. One of these parties is reported to have reached a mighty cañon, into
which it was impossible to descend. The cañon was so deep that rocks standing in the bottom,
which were in reality higher than the Seville cathedral, appeared no taller than a man.

Another party discovered the mouth of the river and called it, because of their safe arrival,
The River of Our Lady of Safe Conduct. They went as far up the river as its shallow waters
would permit, but failed to find the seven cities of which they were in search, and turned
about and went back to Mexico. For years afterward the river remained undisturbed, so far as
white men were concerned. A great part of the stream was unknown even to the Indians, for the
barren plateaus upon either side offered no inducements to approach.

Trappers and explorers in the Rocky Mountains reached the head waters of the river nearly one
hundred years ago, and followed the converging branches down as far as they dared toward the
dark and forbidding cañons. It was believed that no boat could pass through the cañons, and
that once launched upon those turbid waters, the adventurer would never be able to return.

The Colorado remained a river of mystery for nearly three centuries after its discovery. When
California and New Mexico had become a part of the Union, about the middle of the last century,
the cañon of the Colorado was approached at various points by government exploring parties,
which brought back more definite reports concerning the rugged gorge through which the river flows.

In 1869 Major Powell, at the head of a small party, undertook the dangerous trip through the
cañon by boat. After enduring great hardships for a number of weeks, the party succeeded in
reaching the lower end of the cañon. Major Powell's exploit has been repeated by only one other
company, and some members of this party perished before the dangerous feat was accomplished.

The Colorado is a wonderful stream. It is fed by the perpetual snows of the Rocky Mountains.
For some distance the tributary streams flow through fertile valleys, many of them now richly
and widely cultivated. But soon the branches unite in one mighty river which, seeming to shun
life and sunlight, buries itself so deeply in the great plateau that the traveller through
this region may perish in sight of its waters without being able to descend far enough to reach
them. After passing through one hundred miles of cañon, the river emerges upon a desert region,
where the rainfall is so slight that curious and unusual forms of plants and animals have been
developed, forms which are adapted to withstand the almost perpetual sunshine and scorching
heat of summer.

Below the Grand Cañon the river traverses an open valley, where the bottom lands support a
few Indians who raise corn, squashes, and other vegetables. At the Needles the river is hidden
for a short time within cañon walls, but beyond Yuma the valley widens, and the stream enters
upon vast plains over which it flows to its mouth in the Gulf of California.

No portion of the river is well adapted to navigation. Below the cañon the channels are shallow
and ever changing. At the mouth, enormous tides sweep with swift currents over the shallows
and produce foam-decked waves known as the "bore."

Visit the Colorado River whenever you will, at flood time in early summer, or in the fall and
winter when the waters are lowest, you will always find it deeply discolored. The name "Colorado"
signifies red, and was given to the river by the Spaniards. Watch the current and note how
it boils and seethes. It seems to be thick with mud. The bars are almost of the same color
as the water and are continually changing. Here a low alluvial bank is being washed away, there
a broad flat is forming. With the exception of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and the Gila,
which joins the Colorado at Yuma, no other river is known to be so laden with silt. No other
river is so rapidly removing the highlands through which it flows.

Over a large portion of the watershed of the Colorado the rainfall is light. This fact might
lead one to think that upon its slopes the work of erosion would go on more slowly than where
the rainfall is heavy. This would, however, be a wrong conclusion, for in places where there
is a great deal of rain the ground becomes covered with a thick growth of vegetation which
holds the soil and broken rock fragments and keeps them from being carried away.

The surface of the plateaus and lower mountain slopes in the basin of the Colorado are but
little protected by vegetation. When the rain does fall in this arid region, it often comes
with great violence. The barren mountain sides are quickly covered with trickling streams,
which unite in muddy torrents in the gulches, carrying along mud, sand, and even boulders in
their rapid course; the torrents in turn deliver a large part of their loads to the river.
As the rain passes, the gulches become dry and remain so until another storm visits the region.
It is storming somewhere within the basin of the Colorado much of the time, for the river drains
two hundred and twenty-three thousand square miles. So it comes about that whether one visits
the river in winter or summer one always finds it loaded with mud.

But what becomes of all this mud? The river cannot drop it in the narrow cañons. It is not
until the river has carried its load of mud down to the region about its mouth, where the current
becomes sluggish, that the heavy brown burden can be discharged. Dip up a glassful of the water
near the mouth of the river, and let it settle, then carefully remove the clear water and allow
the sediment in the bottom to dry. If the water in the glass was six inches deep, there will
finally remain in the bottom a mass of hardened mud, which will vary in amount with the time
of the year in which the experiment is performed, but will average about one-fiftieth of an
inch in thickness. Each cubic foot of the water, then, must contain nearly six cubic inches
of solid sediment or silt.

It has been estimated that the average flow of the Colorado River at Yuma throughout the year
is eighteen thousand cubic feet of water per second. From this fact we can calculate that there
would be deposited at the mouth of the river every year, enough sediment to lie one foot deep
over sixty-six square miles of territory. Nearly one three-hundredth part of the Colorado River
water is silt, while in the case of the Mississippi the silt forms only one part in twenty-nine
hundred.

Now we are prepared to understand the origin of the vast lowlands about the head of the Gulf
of California. Long ago this gulf extended one hundred and fifty miles farther north than it
does at present, so that it reached nearly to the place where the little town of Indio now
stands in the northern end of the Colorado desert.

When the Colorado River first began to flow, it emptied its waters into the gulf not far from
the spot where Yuma is situated. The water was probably loaded with silt then as it is now.
Part of this sediment was dropped at the mouth of the stream, while part was spread by the
currents over the bottom of the adjoining portions of the gulf. The rapidly growing delta crept
southward and westward into the gulf. As fast as the sediment was built up above the reach
of the tide, vegetation appeared, which, retarding the flow of the water at times of flood,
aided the deposition of silt and the building up of the delta.

As the centuries went by, these lowland plains became more and more extensive, until the gulf
was actually divided into two parts by the spreading of the delta across to the western shore.
The portion of the gulf thus cut off from the ocean formed a salt lake fully one hundred miles
in length.

We may suppose that for a long time before the barrier was high and strong, the tidal currents
occasionally broke over the delta and supplied the lake with water. As the river meandered
here and there over the flat delta, its channels must have undergone many changes at every
time of flood. A part of the water without doubt flowed into the salt lake, and another portion
into the open gulf. In fact, the basin in which the lake lay, now known as the Colorado desert,
continued to receive water from the river, at intervals, until very recently. In 1891 an overflow
occurred, through the channel known as New River, which flooded the lower portion of the basin
and threatened to cover the railroad.

When the ocean had been permanently shut off from the head of the gulf, and the river itself
had been largely diverted toward the south, the lake began to dry up. At last, most of the
water disappeared and there remained a vast desert basin, at its greatest depth two hundred
and fifty feet below the level of the ocean. In the bottom of the basin a bed of salt appeared,
for this substance could not be carried away, as the water had been, by the thirsty air.

Remarkably perfect beaches still exist around the shores of this old lake, and on them are
found the pearly shells of multitudes of fresh-water mollusks. The presence of these shells
leads us to believe that after the salt lake dried up, the river again broke in and formed
a new lake of comparatively fresh water which also, after a time, dried up.

The wonderful fertility of the Colorado delta is just beginning to be appreciated. Canals have
been dug to take the water from the river and distribute it over the land. Year by year the
cultivated lands are being extended. The change which irrigation is making upon the surface
of one of the worst deserts in the country is indeed remarkable.

The Colorado River is working on quietly and steadily. We may think, and truly, that it has
already done a great at work in excavating the mighty cañons along its course, but, in reality,
the work already accomplished is small in comparison with that which remains to be done.

In time, if the land is not disturbed by the forces which build mountains, the plateaus through
which the river now flows in such deep cañons will be carried away in the form of sand and
mud. Broad valleys will replace the cañons, and the Gulf of California will become a fertile
plain. As the highlands wear away the process will go on more and more slowly, for there will
be less rainfall. The river will become smaller and its basin more arid. All these changes
will be brought about through the crumbling of the rocks, and the removal of the waste matter
by the running water.

A TRIP INTO THE GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO

We may read of the Colorado plateau, and of the Grand Cañon with its precipitous walls of variously
colored rock, but unless we actually visit this wonderland, it is hard to realize the height
and extent of the plateau and the depth of the gashes made in its surface by running water,
gashes so deep that they seem to expose the very heart of the earth.

Nature has chosen a remote and half-desert region for the location of this, the most picturesque
cañon in the world, as if she wished to keep it as long as possible from the eyes of men. Once
a traveller could not view the cañon without making a long and weary journey across hundreds
of miles of desert; now it is quite different, for one can almost look into its depths from
the windows of a palace car. But to appreciate and understand fully the stupendous work that
nature has done throughout this region we must leave the cars at a somewhat distant point,
and before reaching the cañon become acquainted with the country in which it lies through the
old-fashioned ways of travelling on horseback or wagon.

Flagstaff was formerly the starting-point for travellers to the cañon, and we will choose it
now, for the old stage road offers an interesting ride. The road first winds around that lofty
snow-clad peak, the San Francisco Mountain, which can be seen from all northern Arizona. Leaving
the mountain behind, we strike out directly across the high plateau. The country is nearly
level, and the open park-like forest extends in every direction as far as one can see.

It is difficult for us to believe that we are seven thousand feet above the sea, a height greater
than that of the highest mountains in the United States east of the Mississippi Valley. It
is this elevation, however, which brings the summer showers and makes the air cool and pleasant,
for the lowlands of this portion of the United States are barren deserts, upon which the sun
beats with almost savage heat.

After the rainy season green grass and an abundance of flowers appear in the open meadows scattered
through the forest. But, as a rule, the entire absence of water strikes one as being very strange.
Where are the springs and running streams which usually abound in mountainous regions? Throughout
the whole distance of seventy miles from Flagstaff to the cañon, there are but one or two spots
where water is to be found. These places are known as "water-holes"; they are simply hollows
in the surface of the ground where the water collects after the showers.

There is another strange feature about the plateau over which the road leads; instead of sloping
down toward the Colorado River and the Grand Cañon, the surface slowly rises, so that the little
streams which are formed after the heavy rains flow away from the river.

Our journey draws to an end, but there is nothing to indicate the presence of the cañon until
we get glimpses through the trees of an apparently bottomless gulf. The gulf widens upon a
closer view, we reach the edge, and all its wonderful proportions burst upon us. Does the Grand
Cañon look as you thought it would? Probably not, for it is unlike any other in the world.
The cañon is very deep. The river has worn its way for more than a mile down into the plateau,
which once stretched unbroken from the cliffs upon which we stand, across to those upon the
opposite side, nearly ten miles away.

The clear air makes objects upon the opposite side and in the bottom of the cañon seem much
nearer than they really are. You may think that it is an easy task to go to the bottom of the
cañon and climb back again in a day, but in reality it is so difficult an undertaking that
only those who are accustomed to mountain climbing can accomplish it.

It is not merely the great width and depth of the cañon that impress us, but also the bright,
variegated colors which the different rock layers display as they stretch in horizontal bands
along the faces of the cliffs, or sweep around the towers and pinnacles until their detailed
outlines are lost in the distant blue haze.

Our eyes wander far down, toward the bottom of the cañon, following the alternate lines of
precipitous cliffs and slopes covered with rock fragments. The cliffs and slopes succeed each
other like the steps in a giant stairway, until at the very bottom the opposite walls meet
in a gorge so narrow that in only a few places does the river come into view, glistening like
a silver thread.

A hotel stands among the trees a short distance from the brink of the cañon. Living here is
expensive, for every article of food has to be brought upon the cars and wagons for a distance
of hundreds of miles. Even the water has to be brought in wagons from a distant spring.

In visiting the cañon we have the choice of going on horseback or on foot. While the latter
method is much harder, yet one feels safer upon his own feet while moving along the steep and
narrow trail. Our start is made in the cool air of the early morning. Leaving the top of the
plateau, where among the pines the summer air is seldom sultry, and the winters are cold and
snowy, we descend, until, by luncheon time, we are far below the heights and in the midst of
an almost tropical climate. This difference in climatic features between the top and bottom
of the cañon is equal to the change which the traveller experiences in a trip from the pine
forests of the northern United States to the cactus-covered plains of Arizona.

As we look down from the top of the trail it does not seem possible to pass the great cliffs
below, and yet there must be a way, since others have gone before us. All that we have to do
is simply to follow the beaten path. Nature has conveniently left narrow shelves, crevices,
and less precipitous slopes here and there, which need only the application of the pick and
shovel to be made passable even for pack animals. Where the trail winds into shady recesses,
we find stunted fir and pine trees clinging to the crevices and stretching their roots down
into the waste rock collected upon projecting ledges.

Down, down we go. The belt of the yellow pine and fir is left behind, and we come to the habitat
of the piñon pine and juniper. These two will flourish where there is less moisture than is
needed by the trees which grow nearer the top. Soon the trees have all disappeared and such
plants as the greasewood, cactus, and agave take their place. Here, if it were not for the
walls of rock rising on every hand, we might imagine ourselves upon one of the desert plains
of Arizona.

New views open at every turn in the trail, as it winds along the narrow shelves of rock with
precipitous walls above and below. Now it zigzags back and forth down a gentle slope, but is
soon stopped by another precipice. In one place, to escape a rocky point, the trail has been
carried around the face of a cliff on a sort of shelf made of logs. It then passes through
a crevice formed by the splitting away of a huge piece of the wall. In many places the grade
is so steep that the trail is made practically a stairway, for the steps are necessary to keep
animals from slipping.

Step by step we descend until the slope becomes more gentle and a sort of terrace is reached,
where men are at work developing a copper mine. Everything needed for the mine is carried down
packed upon the backs of sure-footed burros. Even the water has to be brought in kegs from
a little spring still deeper in the cañon.

The trail leaves the mine and winds down past another cliff, until, when more than three thousand
feet from the top of the plateau, we find water for the first time. The little springs issue
from the sandstone, and their limited supply of water is soon drunk up by the thirsty sands.

As far as the water flows it forms a little oasis upon the barren slope. Along the course of
the streams are little patches of green grass, flowers, and bushes. Birds flit about, and there
are tracks of small animals in the mud. Evidently the water is as great an attraction to them
as it is to us. If a well were dug in the plateau above, we can understand now how deep it
would have to be in order to reach water. A well three-fourths of a mile deep would be a difficult
one to pump.

We are now in the bottom of the main cañon, but deeper still is the last and inner gorge, through
which the Colorado is flowing. For thousands of centuries the river has been sawing its way
down into the earth. The precipitous cliffs which we have passed are formed of hard sandstone
or limestone. The more gentle slopes consist of softer shales. Now the river has cut through
them all and has reached the very heart of the earth, the solid granite.

This inner gorge has almost vertical walls twelve hundred to fifteen hundred feet high. We
can sit upon the brink under a ledge of rock which protects us from the hot sun, and watch
the river as we eat our luncheon. Far below, almost directly under us, it rushes along. The
roar of the current rises but faintly to our ears. The water is very muddy and not at all like
the clear mountain streams, far away upon the continental divide, which unite to form the river.
It seems as if the water, ashamed of its soiled appearance, wanted to hide from the sight of
men. If so, it has succeeded well, for it can be seen only at rare intervals from the top of
the cañon walls, and even at the bottom of the main cañon the river itself is not visible unless
one stands upon the very brink of the granite gorge.

The work of the river is not yet done. It will go on until the great cliffs have crumbled and
have been replaced by gentle slopes. It will not stop until, at some far distant time, a broad
valley has been worn out of the rocky strata.

The cañon appears much wider when viewed from the bottom than from the top, and the great cliffs
far back along the trail seem less precipitous, but only because they are so far away. A weary
climb of several miles awaits us. We must rest and take breath frequently or we shall not reach
the top.

As night approaches and the shadows begin to fall, every turret and pinnacle stands out in
bold relief. The bands of yellow and red shade into purple, and everything, save the long winding
trail, begins to have a weird and mystical look.

HOW THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU WAS MADE

Years ago people disputed as to the way in which the earth was made. Those who lived where
all the rocks had, like lava, the appearance of having once been melted, believed that fire
had done all the work. Those who lived where the rocks appeared to be formed of hardened mud,
sand, and lime, substances such as we find accumulating under water, said that water alone
had been the means. But in later years the earth's surface has been more widely explored, and
now it is known that both opinions were partly right. Water and fire have both been concerned
in the making of the earth.

In the great valleys fire-formed rocks are rare, but they are more or less abundant in all
mountainous regions, for where mountains are, there the crust of the earth is weakest. There
are many reasons for believing that the interior of the earth is very hot. We know that the
surface is settling in some places and rising in others, and that where the strain of the upheaval
is too great the rocks are broken. These convulsions sometimes cause earthquakes and sometimes
volcanic eruptions, when enormous quantities of molten rock are poured out over the surface.
In all the long history of our earth probably no greater flood of lava than that which made
the Columbia plateau was ever spread over the surface of any region. Travel where you will
over the plains of southern Idaho, central Washington, or Oregon, and examine the rocks which
here and there rise above the soil or are exposed in the cañons, and you will find that they
all appear to have been formed by fire.

These rocks are dark in color and very hard. They are not arranged in regular layers like sandstone
and shale; many of them show numerous little cavities which once contained steam. These cavities
give to the rock a slag-like appearance. In this kind of rock, which we shall call lava, there
are, of course, no remains of shells or bones of animals such as are often found in rocks formed
from sand or clay.

Do not picture to yourself the Columbia plateau as one continuous stretch of level land, for
it is broken by many mountain ranges. Some of these are old mountains which were too tall to
be buried by the lava, but most of them have been formed out of the plateau itself. The eruptions
which made the plateau extended through a very long time, perhaps hundreds of thousands of
years, and the older lava is deeply decayed and covered with soil. Some of the later flows
show extremely rough and rugged surfaces and are probably only a few hundred years old.

Long ago, before the eruptions began, the geography of the Northwest was very different from
what it is now. Instead of a vast plateau there were mountains and valleys. Lowlands occupied
most of the region where the Cascade Range now rises with its lofty volcanic peaks. Portions
of the basin of the present Columbia River were occupied by lakes which extended southwest
into California.

Movements of the earth began to affect the region of the present plateau, and at many points
the solid rocks were fissured and broken. Then from that mysterious region far beneath the
surface came steam and gases, escaping through the fissures with explosive force. In some places
cinder cones were built about the openings by the fragments of lava which were hurled out.
In other places, during periods of less explosive eruption, molten lava flowed out in vast
quantities. The lava was very hot and almost as liquid as water, so that it spread in thin
sheets over hundreds of square miles of lowland.

One important series of fissures through which eruptions took place marked the line where the
Cascade Range was to be built. Other volcanoes appeared over the surface of southern Idaho,
central Washington, Oregon, and northeastern California.

The eruptions were not continuous over the whole field; now in this place, now in that, there
came long periods of quiet. During such periods the earthquakes ceased, the lava became cold,
and the clouds of volcanic ashes cleared from the air. Frequently the lava intercepted streams
and blocked the valleys so that large lakes were formed. Whenever the periods of quiet were
very long, plants spread over the surface and animals of many kinds made their homes about
the lakes.

In eastern Oregon the John Day River and its branches have eroded cañons through the later
lava and have exposed the sands, clays, and gravels which collected at the bottom of one of
those ancient lakes. In these beds the skeletons of many strange and interesting animals have
been found. Evidently they had once lived about the borders of the lake, and the streams had
washed their bones into the water and mingled them with the sediment.

One of these animals appears to have been an ancestor of the present horse. It was about the
size of a sheep, and had three toes instead of one. Another, probably a very dangerous animal,
was related to our present hog, but stood nearly seven feet high. Others resembled the rhinoceros,
camel, tapir, or peccary. All but the peccary are now extinct upon this continent. Of the carnivorous
animals there were wolves and cats of large size.

The eruptions continued, filling the valleys little by little, until in places the lava reached
a thickness of nearly four thousand feet. The lower mountains were hidden from sight. We know
of the existence of these buried mountains because the wearing away of the lava in some places
has exposed their summits to view.

The lava flood reached farther and farther. In southern Idaho it formed the Snake River plains,
which must have been, when first formed, hundreds of miles long, seventy-five miles wide, and
almost as even as a floor. If we could have looked on while these things were taking place
it would have appeared as if the whole land was about to sink under the fiery mass which flowed
out of the earth. The streams and valleys were completely buried. The region of the John Day
Lake, with all its animal remains, was covered. The lava, like a sea, crept up against the
mountains surrounding the plateau region. Bays of lava extended into the valleys among the
mountains, while mountain ridges rose like islands and capes from the surface of the flood.

We never tire of looking at the lofty snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Range. A dozen of them
rise over ten thousand feet, and two, Mounts Shasta and Ranier, are more than fourteen thousand
feet high. All these mountains were formed of material thrown out of the interior of the earth
during the building of the Columbia plateau. The process was very similar for each. About some
one exceptionally active crater immense quantities of scoriæ[1] and lapilli[2] accumulated.
Then came streams of fiery lava, some of which, hardening upon the outer slopes of the crater,
added still more to the growth of the mountain. The process was very slow, however. A time
of eruption, marked by tremblings of the earth, explosive noises, and a sky filled with dust
and clouds, might last for many years. Then came a long period of rest when the falling rains,
gathering in dashing torrents, cut deep gullies down the sides of the mountain.

[Footnote 1: scorioe, cellular, slaggy lava.]

[Footnote 2: lapilli, volcanic ashes, consisting of small, angular, stony fragments.]

The volcanoes at last ceased to grow any higher, for the lava, if the eruptions continued,
formed new craters at their bases. It is probable that all these great peaks have been extinct
for several thousand years, although some are much older and more worn away than others. One
of these volcanoes has completely disappeared, and in its place lies that wonderful sheet of
water known as Crater Lake. It is thought that the interior of this mountain was melted away
during a period of activity, and that the outer portion fell in, leaving a crater five miles
across and nearly a mile deep.

The streams of lava, as they flowed here and there building up the plateau, frequently broke
up the rivers and turned them into new channels. As time went on the eruptions were less violent,
and the rivers became established in the channels which they occupy to-day. The Columbia River,
winding about over the plateau, sought the easiest path to the sea. It soon began to dig a
channel, and now has hidden itself between dark walls of lava.

But other forces besides the streams were now at work in this volcanic region. The lava plateau
began slowly to bend upward along the line of the great volcanoes, lifting them upward with
it. In this manner the Cascade Range was formed. The Columbia River, instead of seeking another
way to the sea, continued cutting its channel deeper and deeper into the growing mountain range,
and so has given us that picturesque cañon which forms a most convenient highway from the interior
of Washington and Oregon to the coast.

Take a sheet of writing paper, lay it upon an even surface, then slowly push the opposite edges
toward each other. This simple experiment will aid one in understanding one of the ways in
which mountain ranges are made. Besides the upward fold of the plateau which made the Cascade
Range, another was formed between the Blue Mountains in eastern Oregon and a spur of the Rocky
Mountains in northern Idaho. This fold lay across the path of the Snake River, but its movement
was so slow that the river kept its former channel and in this rising land excavated a cañon
which to-day is more than a mile deep. The upper twenty-five hundred feet of the cañon are
cut into the lava of the plateau, and the lower three thousand into the underlying granite.
The cañon is not so picturesque as the Colorado, for it has no rocks with variegated coloring
or castellated walls. Its sides are, however, exceedingly precipitous and it is difficult to enter.

Along portions of the lower Columbia and Snake rivers, navigation is obstructed by rapids and
waterfalls. The presence of these falls teaches us that these streams are still at work cutting
their channels deeper. The Snake River in its upper course has as yet cut only a very shallow
channel in the hard lava, and the beautiful Shoshone Falls marks a point where its work is
slow. These falls, which are the finest in the northwest, owe their existence to the fact that
at this particular spot layers of strong resistant lava cover the softer rocks.

There are other cañons in the plateau region which are fully as remarkable as those which have
been mentioned. That of the Des Chutes River in central Oregon is in places a thousand feet
deep, with almost vertical walls of lava.

We have already seen how mountains have been formed upon the Columbia plateau, by a bending
of the earth upward. Other mountains of the plateau are due to fractures in the solid rocks,
often many miles long. Upon one side of these fractures the surface has been depressed, while
upon the other it has been raised. The amount of the uplift varies from a few hundred to thousands
of feet. The mountains thus formed have a long, gentle slope upon one side and a very steep
incline upon the other. They are known as "block mountains," and those upon the Columbia plateau
are the most interesting of their kind in the world.

With the exception of a few large rivers, the greater portion of the Columbia plateau is remarkable
for its lack of surface streams. The water which reaches the borders of the plateau from the
surrounding mountains often sinks into the gravel between the layers of lava and forms underground
rivers. The deep cañons which have been mentioned intercept some of these underground rivers,
so that their waters pour out and down over the sides of the cañons in foaming cascades. The
greatest of these cascades is that known as the Thousand Springs in the Snake River cañon.
The waters of the Blue Lakes in the cañon of the same river below Shoshone Falls also come
from underneath the lava. They are utilized in irrigating the most picturesque fruit ranch
in southern Idaho.

The climate of the plateau is dry, and its eastern portion is practically a desert. Toward
the west, however, the rainfall is greater, and in central Washington and northern Oregon the
plateau becomes one vast grain-field. It is difficult to irrigate the plateau because the streams
flow in such deep cañons, but above the point where the cañon of the Snake River begins there
is an extensive system of canals and cultivated fields. With a sufficient water supply, the
lava makes one of the richest and most productive of soils. Along the Snake and Columbia rivers,
wherever there is a bit of bottom land, orchards have been planted. Little steamers ply along
these rivers between the rapids, gathering the fruit and delivering it at the nearest railroad
point.

Mining is carried on only in the mountains which rise above the lava flood, for the mineral
veins are for the most part older than the lava of the plateau. We are certain that many very
valuable deposits of the precious metals lie buried beneath the lava fields.

It is thought that the volcanic history of the Columbia plateau has been completed. Now the
streams are at work carrying away the materials of which it is composed and may in time uncover
the old buried land surface.

THE CAÑONS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS

The western half of our country contains the deepest and most picturesque cañons in the world.
Those of the Colorado and Snake rivers form trenches in a comparatively level but lofty plateau
region. The cañons of the Sierra Nevada Range, on the contrary, take their rise and extend
for much of their length among rugged snowcapped peaks which include some of the highest mountains
in the United States. All these cañons are the work of erosion. The rivers did not find depressions
formed ready for them to occupy, but had to excavate their channels by the slow process of
grinding away the solid rock.

The streams of the Sierra Nevada mountains begin their course in steep-walled alcoves under
the shadows of the high peaks, where they are fed by perpetual snow-banks. Soon they bury themselves
between granite walls, which at last tower three thousand feet above their roaring waters.
After many miles the cañons widen, the walls decrease in height, and the streams come out upon
the fertile stretches of the Great Valley of California.

Nature works in many ways. Her tools are of different kinds, but the most important one is
running water. The forms which she produces are dependent upon the kind of rock upon which
she works. Where the surface of the earth is soft the results of her labor are not very interesting,
but if the crust is hard the forms which she produces are often so remarkable that they arouse
our wonder and admiration.

In shaping the Sierra Nevada mountains Nature had a grand opportunity. Here she produced the
Yosemite Valley, which has a setting of cliffs and waterfalls that attract people from all
over the world. Hetch-Hetchy Valley at the north of the Yosemite, and Tehipite and King's River
cañons at the south, are interesting places, but not so majestic and inspiring as the Yosemite.

Nature never seems satisfied with her work. After she has created a piece of wonderful scenery
she proceeds to destroy it. The great cliffs of the Yosemite will sometime lose their grandeur
and be replaced by gentle slopes down which the streams will flow quietly. The mountains of
the Laurentian highlands in the northeastern portion of the continent undoubtedly were once
lofty and picturesque, but there were no people upon the earth at that time to enjoy this scenery.
Now these mountains have become old and are nearly worn down.

In one portion of the earth after another, Nature raises great mountain ranges and immediately
proceeds to remove them. This continent was discovered and California was settled at the right
time for the Sierra Nevadas to be seen in all their grandeur.

When the pioneers came in sight of the Sierra Nevada (snowy range), they little dreamed of
the cañons hidden among these mountains. Gold, and not scenery, was the object of their search.
The great cañons were outside of the gold regions, and so inaccessibly situated that no one
except the Indians looked upon them until 1851. In that year a party of soldiers following
the trail of some thieving Indians discovered and entered the Yosemite Valley, but it was not
explored until 1855. For many years the valley could be reached only by the roughest trails,
but as its advantages became more widely known roads were built, and there are now three different
wagon routes by which it may be entered.

The history of the Yosemite Valley is like that of all the other cañons of the Sierra Nevada
mountains. Long ago there were no high mountains in eastern California. If there had been explorers
crossing the plains in those days, they would have found no rugged wall shutting them off from
the Pacific. There came a time, however, when the surface of the western portion of America
was broken by violent earthquake movements, and hundreds of fissures were formed. Some of the
earth blocks produced by these fissures were shoved upward, while others were dropped. One
enormous block, which was to form the Sierra Nevada, was raised along its eastern edge until
it stood several thousand feet above the adjoining country. The movement was like that of a
trap-door opened slightly, so that upon one side--in this case the western one--the slope was
long and gentle, while upon the east it was very abrupt.

Nature, the sculptor, took this mountain block in hand, and with the aid of running water began
to carve its surface into a most intricate system of cañons and ridges. The streams first flowed
over the easiest slopes to the Great Valley of California, but soon they began to cut their
way down into the granite, while along the crests of the ridges the more resistant rocks began
to stand out as jagged peaks.

Thus Nature worked until the mountains promised before long to be well worn down. The cañons
had widened to valleys and the rugged slopes had given place to gentle ones. Toward the northern
end of the range the work was even farther advanced, for the streams, now choked with gravel
and sand, flowed over broad flood plains. In this gravel was buried a part of the wealth of
California. The rocks over which the streams flowed contained veins of quartz with little particles
of gold scattered through it, and as the surface rock crumbled and was worn away, the gold,
being much heavier, slowly accumulated in the gravel at the bottom of the streams. This gold
amounted in value to hundreds of millions of dollars.

The forces within the earth became active again. Apparently Nature did not intend that the
gold should be forever buried, or that the country should always appear so uninteresting. Internal
forces raised the mountain block for a second time, tilting it still more to the westward.
Volcanoes broke forth along the summit of the range near the line of fracture, and floods of
lava and volcanic mud ran down the slopes, completely filling the broad valleys of the northern
Sierras and burying a great part of the gold-bearing gravel.

The eruptions turned the streams from their channels, but on the steeper slope of the mountains
the rivers went energetically to work making new beds. They cut down through the lava and the
buried gravel until they finally reached the solid rock underneath. Into this rock, which we
call "bed-rock," they have now worn cañons two thousand feet deep. The beds of gravel that
lay under the old streams frequently form the tops of the hills between these deep cañons.
Here they are easily accessible to the miners, who by tunnels or surface workings have taken
out many millions of dollars' worth of gold.

The important cañons of the northern Sierras, where the gold is found, have been made by the
American and Feather rivers. Farther south are the deeper and more rugged cañons of the Tuolumne,
Merced, King's, and Kern rivers, which open to us inviting pathways into the mountains.

It might be supposed that the mantle of snow and ice which at that time covered most of the
surface of the earth would have protected it from further erosion, but this was not the case.
In the basin at the head of each stream the snow accumulated year after year until it was more
than a thousand feet deep. Under the influence of the warm days and cold nights the snow slowly
turned to ice, and moved by its own weight, crept down into the cañons. The solid rock walls
were ground and polished, and even now, so long a time after the glaciers have melted, some
of these polished surfaces still glisten in the sunlight. The glaciers deepened and enlarged
the cañons, but running water was the most important agent in their making.

Upon the disappearance of the glaciers, the streams went to work again deepening their cañons.
From their starting-points, under the lofty crags, they first ran through broad upland valleys,
then tumbled into the cañons; but until they had reached the lower mountain slopes, to which
the glaciers had not extended, they passed through a dreary and desolate region devoid of almost
every sign of life. The glaciers had swept away all the loose rock and soil, and it was many
long years before the surface again crumbled so that forest trees could spread over it once more.

The grandeur and attractiveness of the Yosemite is partly due to the precipitous cliffs enclosing
the valley, some of which are nearly four thousand feet in height, partly to the high waterfalls,
and partly to the green meadows and forest groves through which the Merced River winds.

Although the glaciers had little to do with the making of the Yosemite Valley, yet they added
to its attractiveness. The valley is situated where a number of smaller streams join the Merced
River. Erosion was more rapid here because the granite was soft, while the vertical seams in
the rock gave the growing valley precipitous walls. When the glacier came it pushed out the
loose rocks and boulders, and dropping a portion of them at the lower end, made a dam across
the Merced River. At first a shallow lake filled the valley, but after a time the silt and
gravel which the streams were continually bringing in filled the lake, and formed marshy flats.
Finally, grasses and trees spread over these flats and gave the valley the appearance which
it has to-day.

Besides the meadows, the glaciers gave us two of the waterfalls. Yosemite Creek, which comes
down over the walls twenty-seven hundred feet in three successive falls, was turned into its
present channel by a dam which a glacier had left across its old course. A glacier also turned
the Merced River at its entrance to the main valley so as to form the Nevada Fall.

After the valley had been made and clothed in vegetation, it was discovered by a small tribe
of Indians who came here to make their home, secure from all their enemies. There were fish
in the streams and animals in the woods. The oaks supplied acorns, and in early summer the
meadows were covered with strawberries. Legends were associated with many of the cliffs and
waterfalls, for the Indians, like ourselves, are impressed by the wonders of Nature.

Hetch-Hetchy Valley, twenty-five miles north of the Yosemite, has been formed upon much the
same plan, but a portion of its floor is marshy and there are few waterfalls. King's River
Cañon has no green meadows and no high waterfalls, while its great granite walls are not so
precipitous as those of the Yosemite. Next to the Yosemite, in the wildness of its scenery,
is Tehipite Cañon. This cañon is situated upon the middle fork of King's River, about a hundred
miles south. For many miles its walls and domes present ever changing views.

A continual struggle is going on between the forces within the earth and the sculptor working
upon its surface. First one, then the other, gains the advantage. Where the mountains are steep
and high, often the forces within have recently been active. Where they are low and the slopes
are gentle, the sculptor has long held sway. She begins by making the surface as rough and
picturesque as possible, but after a time she destroys her own handiwork.

AN OREGON GLACIER

There are records all about us of events which took place upon the earth long before there
were any human inhabitants. These records have been preserved in the rocks, in the geographic
features of the land and water, and in the distribution of the animals and plants. On every
hand appear evidences of changes in the surface of the earth and in the climate.

Through all the central and northern United States, if we except some of the mountains of the
West, the winter snows entirely disappear long before the coming of summer. But the climate
of this region has not always been so pleasant and mild. Lands now densely peopled were once
buried under a thick mantle of ice which lasted through many thousands of years.

Scattered over the surface of the northern United States are vast numbers of boulders and rock
fragments which are not at all like the solid rocks beneath the soil. The history of these
materials takes us back to the Glacial period, which can be best understood from a study of
some one of the glaciers now existing upon the mountains of the northwestern part of our country.

Among the lofty mountain ranges of the Cordilleran region there are many peaks upon which perpetual
snow-banks nestle, defying the long summer days. Where the winters are long and cold and the
storms are severe, immense drifts of snow collect in the hollows and cañons of the mountain
slopes. Each summer all or a part of this snow melts. Upon the northern slopes the melting
process is slower, and if there happens to be a large basin upon that side, an extensive field
of snow remains until the winter storms come again. Each winter new snow is added to the surface,
while the older snow, becoming hard and firm through repeated freezing and thawing, at last
turns to ice.

This mass of snow and ice does not remain stationary, as might be expected from its apparent
solidity. Under the influence of its own weight and of alternations of heat and cold, it flows
down the incline like a very thick liquid. During the winter the ice melts but little, and
the movement is slow, but in the summer, under the influence of the warm days and cool nights,
both the melting and the rate of flow of the ice are increased. A moving body of snow and ice
of this sort is called a "glacier." It creeps down the mountain slope and into some cañon,
until, in the warmer air of the lower mountains, the rate of advance is exactly balanced by
the rate of melting at the lower end of the mass. The glaciers in the United States are at
present comparatively small, but once these icy masses stretched over the mountains and lowlands
of a large portion of the continent.

In the southern Sierra Nevada mountains no permanent snow exists below an elevation of about
eleven thousand feet, but as we go north snow-fields are found lower and lower, until in the
fiords of Alaska enormous glaciers reach down to the sea.

A glacier worthy of our study may be found upon the Three Sisters, a group of lofty and picturesque
volcanic mountains rising from the summit of the Cascade Range in central Oregon. There is
a deep depression between two of the peaks, which slopes down to the north and is thus particularly
well adapted to catch and retain the drifting snows. Consequently the glacier to which it gives
rise is of exceptional size, being nearly three miles long and half a mile wide.

The easiest path to the Three Sisters is by way of the McKenzie River from Eugene, Oregon.
The McKenzie is a noted stream and one of the most beautiful in the state. The river courses
through dense forests, and its clear, cold water is filled with trout. So tempestuous is the
weather about the Cascade range that July is almost the only month in which one can visit the
Three Sisters without danger of being caught in severe storms.

The traveller leaves the river a few miles above McKenzie Bridge, where a small tributary known
as Lost Creek joins it. Lost Creek flows under the lava from a lake near the Three Sisters,
while another stream, coming from the glacier of which we are in search, flows down the same
valley upon the surface of the lava and almost directly over the hidden stream.

Upon the summit of the Cascade Range the dense forests of the river valley give place to more
open woods interspersed with park-like meadows. A few miles away to the south rise the volcanic
peaks of the Three Sisters, clear and cold in the mountain air, wrapt about with a mantle of
white except where the slopes are too precipitous to hold the snow.

An indistinct trail leads through the tamarack forest and over a field of rugged lava to the
base of the peaks. Here we come upon a swiftly flowing stream of a strange milky color. This
appearance is due to the presence of fine mud, the product of the work of the glacier at the
head of the stream as it slowly and with mighty power grinds away the surface of the rocks
over which it moves. Wherever one meets a stream of this kind, he will probably be safe in
asserting that it is fed by a glacier upon some distant mountain peak.

This little stream, the course of which we must follow to reach the glacier, is choked with
sand and pebbles brought to it by the moving ice. These are not ordinary stream pebbles, for
they have strangely flattened sides which often show scratches, and look as if they had been
ground off against a grindstone. They are the tools with which the ice does its work. The ice
block takes up the rock fragments which fall upon its surface or which it tears from beneath,
and carries them along, grinding every surface which it touches. The fragments are dropped
at the end of the glacier, and the smaller pebbles are washed away down the stream that flows
from the melting ice.

We follow up the little glacial creek, past icy snow-banks and through groves of fir trees
where the warm sunshine brings out the resinous odors. Upon one side of the cañon there lies
a field of black lava which not many hundreds of years ago forced this glacial creek from an
earlier channel into its present bed. Now we come upon what appears at first to be a snow-bank
lying across the course of the stream, and from beneath which its waters issue. Deep cracks
in the outer mass of snow show the clear, pale-green ice below. This is the lower end of the
glacier which we have been so long a time in reaching.

A short climb up a steep slope brings us to the top of the glacier. It forms a perfectly even
plain, extending back with a gentle slope to the head of a deep notch between the two northern
Sisters, while above and beyond rise the steeper snow-fields, from which this ice is continually
renewed.

The glacier does not terminate in the usual manner, with a stream flowing from its centre,
for the outlet is at one side, while the middle abuts against a low mound of rock. This mound
we find most interesting, for upon reaching its top we look down into a volcanic crater. From
this crater flowed the great stream of lava to which we have already referred. The lava ran
downward, bending this way and that among the hollows, until it spread nearly to the McKenzie
River.

During the Glacial period, before the eruption took place, this glacier was much larger. The
summit of the Cascade Range was then covered by glaciers. This fact we know from the presence
of grooved and polished rocks wherever the surface has not been worn away or covered with newer
lava. The Glacial period had passed away and the climate had become much the same as it now
is when the volcanic forces broke out at the spot where the crater is situated. The eruption
undoubtedly melted the ice in the vicinity, but after it had ceased and the rocks had become
cold, the glacier never gained strength enough to push the loose materials of the volcanic
cone out of its path. The ice banked up snugly against the obstruction, and as it melted the
water found its way out at the side of the lava.

Although the surface of the glacier appears at first to offer an easy route to the higher mountain
slopes, yet there are numerous hidden crevices into which one may fall. The safest arrangement
is to tie a company of people together with a stout rope, so that if one falls into a crevice
the rope will save him. Toward the middle of the glacier the ice becomes so badly fissured
that it is necessary to turn toward the right margin. There are two sets of these fissures,
one parallel to the direction in which the glacier is moving, the other at right angles. They
are due to the strain to which the ice is subjected as it moves along at an uneven rate and
over a surface composed of hollows and ridges.

Leaving the glacier, we climb upon a long low ridge of gravel and boulders mixed with fragments
of ice. The fragments of rock which have fallen upon the surface of the ice or been torn from
the rock over which it is moving, have been heaped up along its sides somewhat as a ridge of
snow is raised along each side of the course of a snow-plough. Such a ridge of débris along
the side of a glacier is known as a marginal moraine. A similar ridge, formed by the accumulation
of rock fragments at the lower end of the glacier, is a terminal moraine. These ridges and
hollows formed by the ice are found all over the northern portion of the United States. The
hollows once filled with ice are now occupied by the beautiful lakes of this portion of our
country.

As we climb along the moraine at the margin of the glacier, many openings appear in the clear
green ice. There is the sound of gurgling waters, and occasionally pieces of ice and rock fall
into dimly outlined caverns which are narrow at the top, but far below widen out to the proportion
of chambers.

After the head of the glacier is attained there is still a hard climb over the snow-fields,
which extend upward so far that they seem to have no end. When at last the gap between the
peaks is gained we are completely tired out. The summit of the middle Sister rising directly
above us is still a thousand feet higher, but there is not time to-day to reach it.

A magnificent vista is spread out upon every hand. Extending north and south along the crest
of the Cascade Range there is a line of sharp snowy peaks with summer clouds floating about
them. How these peaks contrast with the dark blue of the surrounding forests! Opposite us,
upon the south, is the third Sister, white with snow from top to bottom, while in the basin
between this peak and the ridge on which we are standing lie the remnants of a once mighty glacier. 

On the second day of his adventures, he saw a mountain and an island at 3:25 PM. He called the
mountain "Alligator Mountain," because of all the pears that he discovered there. He made the island
his mistress. However, after careful investigation, the discoverer realized that the mountain
was merely a mist, and the island a sea-weed. Upon his landing, he received many questions from
natives of the area. Thanks to his education, he was able to answer them with this Hamiltonian
quote, "Popanilla, under these circumstances, was more loquacious
than could have been Capt. Parry."

The region about the Three Sisters is just as nature left it, for the home of the nearest settler
is many miles away. Although now it has few visitors, this country will become attractive when
its wonderful volcanic and glacial phenomena are better known.

SOMETHING ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND MOUNTAIN BUILDING

Our everyday experiences lead us to feel that nothing is more permanent than the features of
the earth upon which we live. Great cities containing costly buildings are built by the water's
edge with the expectation that the ocean will remain where it is. The building of railroads
and canals, and the establishment of industries to make the earth more fruitful and better
adapted to our use, are based upon the idea that the mountains and valleys with their various,
climates will not change.

The study of history, however, makes plain the fact that at different times in the past certain
portions of the earth have been visited by destructive changes. Cities have been shaken down
by earthquakes, and the ocean has swept in over the land, drowning thousands of people. Even
the mountains, which stand upon broad and firm foundations, sometimes bring disaster, by means
of avalanches and land-slides, to the people who live at their bases.

The truth is that the earth's surface is everywhere slowly and quietly changing; but our lives
are so short, and the history of even the oldest cities is so brief in comparison with the
rate at which most of the changes take place, that we as a rule are aware of only the uncommon
and sudden ones.

The occurrence of earthquakes establishes the unmistakable fact that there are forces at work
from within disturbing the surface, while land-slides, and even little gullies washed out by
the rain, show that other forces are working from without.

The vibration or trembling of the earth which we call an "earthquake" always arouses alarm,
and frequently occasions great destruction and loss of life. Only a few of the various causes
that may bring about earthquakes are as yet fully understood. Earthquakes are very interesting,
however, because they are often associated with the birth and growth of lofty mountain ranges.

Volcanic eruptions, hot springs, and the high temperature which exists toward the bottom of
deep mines show us that the interior of the earth is very hot. It is thought that at one time
the whole earth glowed with heat, but as ages passed it became cold upon the outside and a
solid crust was formed.

Every one has observed that fruit becomes wrinkled as the pulp within dries and contracts.
The materials of the earth occupy more space when they are hot than when cold, and as the interior
portion is still cooling, the outer layer or crust continues to shrink down upon it, forming
folds or wrinkles, as in the case of the skin of an apple.

There is probably no portion of the surface that is fixed in its present position. The land
is either rising or sinking continually. If the area that is pushed upward is large, it becomes
a plateau; but if long and narrow like a wrinkle, it forms a mountain range. We should not
be aware of these movements in many cases if it were not for the horizontal shelf cut upon
the borders of the land by the ocean waves. Along some coasts old wave-cut cliffs stand hundreds
of feet above the present ocean level. Other coasts have sunk, so that the water has flooded
the adjoining land and made a new shore line.

When the movements of the land are sudden, they manifest themselves to us through earthquakes.
The crust of the earth is not so flexible as the skin of an apple, and when the strain upon
it becomes too great it suddenly breaks. The rock walls usually slide past one another along
such a fracture. If the rising wall becomes high enough it will form a mountain range.

The great mountain systems border the oceans, for the lines of weakness occur where the land
dips steeply down beneath the water. It sometimes happens that the fractures in the rocks where
mountains are being made are situated underneath the water, or in some position where water
passes down through them in large quantities.

What do you think would happen if such an underground stream of water came in contact with
hot or molten rocks far below the surface? Note the effect produced by drops of water falling
upon a hot stove. Each one, as it strikes, is partly changed to steam with a slight explosive
sound. The result is similar when water is turned into the hot and nearly empty boiler of a
steam-engine--an explosion is sure to follow.

When the pressure of steam suddenly formed within the earth is too great, a volcanic explosion
takes place at some point where the overlying rocks are weakest, probably on or near one of
the lines of fracture about which we have been speaking. The explosion is accompanied by thundering
noises, tremblings of the earth, and the hurling of rock and molten lava into the air. That
the rocks of the earth's crust are elastic is shown by the rebounding of a pebble thrown against
a large boulder. If a file be drawn across the edge of a sheet of tin upon which sand has been
sprinkled, the tin vibrates over its whole extent, as is shown by the jumping of the sand grains.
Because of like elasticity in the materials which make up the surface of the earth, the vibrations
produced by an explosion are carried through the solid earth for hundreds of miles. 

If you're not from around here, do not come around here. Bad, bad things fall onto the heads
of outsiders.

And the hut? It is raised. The floor does not touch the earth. The
mess this infant has made can not simply seep into the black soil
below and alert the demons and their lord that he is here, that the
child is born. It is probable that the earthquakes
which occur so often in the western portion of the United States are due to the first of these
causes. The numerous extinct volcanoes show that at one period this region was frequently shaken
by explosive eruptions.

Mono Lake (see Fig. 42, page 99), at the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada Range, has been
a centre for explosive eruptions, which were extremely violent at one time. The islands which
rise in the lake are shattered, while Black Point, upon the northern shore, has been uplifted
by an explosion from beneath, which split the rocks apart and formed deep fissures.

It is an interesting fact that in the Cordilleran region the mountains have been increasing
in height in very recent years. We might almost say that they are growing to-day. In this region,
then, we can actually see how mountains are made; we do not have to depend upon descriptions
of the manner in which they are supposed to have been made thousands of years ago.

Any good map will show that the mountains of the Cordilleran region have in general a north
and south direction. Their direction was determined by fissures formed long ago in the crust
of the earth. Movements have continued to take place along many of these fissures up to the
present time, and probably will continue for some time to come.

In order to become better acquainted with these remarkable mountains, let us examine some of
them, taking first the Wasatch Range in eastern Utah. The range has an elevation of nearly
eleven thousand feet, rising gradually upon the eastern side, but presenting a bold and picturesque
front upon the west, toward the plain of Great Salt Lake. A short drive from Salt Lake City
brings us to the foot of the range, at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Cañon.

A peculiar bluff which extends for a number of miles along the base of the mountains at once
attracts our attention. The steep face of the bluff, which is from fifty to seventy-five feet
high, appears to have been formed by a rising of the land upon the side next the mountains,
or a dropping upon the valley side. There are reasons for believing that the formation of the
bluff was due to the occurrence of an earthquake some time within the last century. The bluff
is closely related to the mighty mountains behind it. It was formed by the last of a series
of movements in the earth which raised the great block known as the Wasatch Range to an elevation
of six thousand feet above the plains at its base. Is it to be wondered at that disturbances
of the earth which result in the erection of mountains of such height are frequently so severe
as to destroy the strongest buildings?

Now let us go westward across the various parallel ranges of the Great Basin to Owens Valley
at the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. This is the highest and longest continuous
mountain range in the United States. For a distance of more than one hundred miles its elevation
is from twelve thousand to over fourteen thousand feet.

Owens Valley was in 1872 the centre of one of the most severe and extensive earthquakes ever
recorded in the United States. The little village of Lone Pine, situated in the valley below
Mount Whitney, was utterly demolished, twenty people were killed and many injured. A portion
of the valley near the village sank so low that the water flowed in and formed a lake above
it. The land was so shaken up that the fields of one man were thrust into those of his neighbor.
For a distance of several hundred miles to the north along the base of the mountains the earth
was fractured, and bluffs from ten to forty feet high were formed as a result either of the
dropping of the surface of the valley upon the eastern side, or of the raising of the mountains
upon the west.

This slipping of the earth which gave rise to the earthquake bluffs was the most recent of
a long series of similar events which have raised the precipitous eastern wall of the Sierra
Nevada mountains to a height of two miles above Owens Valley. If you will go out into the centre
of the valley and look west toward the mountains, you will see three bluffs or scarps. The
first, which is twenty feet high, was made at the time of the last earthquake; the second,
known as the Alabama Hills and rising about four hundred feet, was formed at an earlier time;
the third, rising back of the others, is that of the main Sierra.

Similar cliffs appear at the bases of other ranges of mountains in the Great Basin. Springs
abound along these fractures in the earth, for the surface waters have an opportunity to collect
wherever the rocks are broken. Numerous fertile valleys mark the line of earthquake movements,
for the broken rocks and abundant springs favor rapid erosion.

Among the Coast Ranges of California there appears a series of fractures in the earth which
form a line nearly four hundred miles long. They extend from a point near San Bernardino in
a northwesterly direction to the neighborhood of San Francisco. Severe earthquakes have taken
place along this line since the country was settled. The pressure and grinding of the earth
upon opposite sides of the fissures has formed long low ridges of earth. Small valleys have
been blocked, and the old stage road from Los Angeles to Bakersfield, which followed the course
of the fissures for a number of miles, has been almost obliterated.

Hundreds of cliffs and mountain scarps throughout the West have come into existence as the
results of movements such as we have been describing. Where the disturbances have been recent
the mountains are bold and picturesque. Those produced in earlier times are in many instances
so worn away that it is difficult to tell with certainty how they were made.

THE LAST VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

There are more volcanoes in our country than is generally supposed. Some are very small and
some rank among the greatest of mountain peaks, but all together there are many hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of them. At present they are all silent and apparently dead. We are accustomed to
speak of them as extinct volcanoes, but of this we must not be too sure.

They stand dark and cold, giving no clue to the nature of the forces which made them, except
perhaps by the presence of an occasional hot spring and the appearance of the rocks of which
they are composed. The slag-like character of these rocks we have learned to associate with
intense heat. He has chosen an individual for his theatrical piece to whom a particular destiny
is unbreakably tied, so much so that it is beyond the bounds of possibility
that one could bring her to mind without immediately calling up her
fate; and this unforgettable circumstance of her biography he has
endeavored to, pro tempore, to eradicate from our cognizance.

 Though you may travel over all that portion of our country, you will find none,
although you will discover in places, as for instance in the palisades of the Hudson, lavas
which came from very ancient volcanoes, worn down so long ago that their very sites are lost
to view.

If we search the Mississippi basin we find there even fewer traces of volcanic action than
upon the eastern highlands. The greater portion of the vast area embraced by the Mississippi
River and its tributaries has had a very uneventful history, although at times earthquakes
may have occurred and the sky may have been darkened by ashes from eruptions in distant parts
of the earth.

It is in the country west of the Rockies, the region last to be explored and settled, that
the objects of our search come to light. Here are volcanoes and lava fields so extensive as
almost to bury from sight the older surface of the earth. Some of them appear as if but yesterday
they had been glowing with heat.

In the Cordilleran region Nature has carried on her work with a master hand. She has lifted
the earth's crust to form a great plateau. Portions of the plateau she has broken, projecting
the fragments upward to form lofty mountains, while along the fissures thus created she has
squeezed out fiery molten matter from the interior of the earth. It was my task to catch that horse
within that couple of hundred yards.At least he let me come near him to catch hold of him,but
he was stubbornly hard to deal with him.It was high time not to do such a mad chase,I never
thought of doing so and indeed the more it lasted the more I becamestubbornly hard to deal with
it.I chased the beast,he let me come close to him and ran suddenly withhigh pitched cry.It
was very annoying which made me more fierce and violent.It was deliberately
hurtful with hidden feeling of joy as if the animal knew that he was
making fool of me with triumphant feeling.At last I became exhausted
with my horse hunt and decided to give a last try and if that failed
then give it off.



A ride of fifteen miles from the town of Flagstaff, across the forest-covered plateau, brings
us to Shadow Mountain and the fields of lava and volcanic sand lying at its base. The mountain,
throughout its height of over one thousand feet, is a conical aggregate of loose lapilli which
give way under the feet and make climbing the peak very tiresome.

The lapilli and scoriæ are slag-like fragments of lava which have been blown out of the throat
of the volcano while in a hot or semi-molten condition. These fragments, as they fall back
to the earth, collect about the opening and in time build up the volcano, or cinder cone, as
such a mountain is frequently called. The finer particles, which have the appearance of dark
sand, fall farther away and form a layer over the surface for some miles upon every side. These
products of an explosive volcano are sometimes called cinders and ashes, because of their resemblance
to the slag and refuse of furnaces.

In the case of the volcano which we are studying, the lapilli are so black that they give the
cone the appearance of being darkened by the shadow of a cloud, and on this account the peak
is named Shadow Mountain. There was, as I said, no doubt by the assembly, what would be received.

In everything went well. The reference to "the government, at the last minute, we have" and
the proposal to write his epitaph, demolished the house. GRAND CROSS is in the Gallery of nervousness
is strongly encouraged results. Larger recreation of the opposition would probably have more of
these look deputy latent humor.
Business Address .-- relocated fact met with censorship, by ASQUITH
in office brighter.

Tuesday .-- imminent change in the ministry foregrounds and distance, which will probably happen
in Ireland, establishing autonomy. Irish members of all sections on alert. SAUNDERSON in his war
paint, which takes the form of brilliant white waistcoat. Always
knows where the Colonel puts, which means business.

Done on Christmas Eve speech marked by Derry Down howls of execration of Irish brothers contrary. That
is precisely what Colonel enjoy, the night moved him to higher oratory. ASQUIUTH its sinister
image, quality control, "sits in the mouth of the volcano Irish" very effective. Effect cruelly
and Irish members responded by putting up REDMOND JUNIOR respond. The colonel smiled gallantly,
but was an effort gashly. Device manifestly effective. REDMOND has been admirable, nothing could
have been better than serious commentary that probably scared the House that in seven years,
sat down to colonel, was able to say that it was "totally innocent - totally harmless."
"Now," ASHBOURNE said in London just now winding up its affairs ministry,
"is the most horrible thing I've heard it said SAUNDERSON."

Later, more serious signs of boiling state of feeling in Ulster brought under notice by the House
of Representatives. Ross, QC, was returned in the elections, instead of CHARLES LEWIS - a useful
character as a study guide for young members, showing how a man of great ability, and various
parliamentary skills could prove a hopeless failure. Ross was born and raised in Derry, accustomed
to the controversial practice.

Already known in his childhood with the dialectic concrete is likely
that when he handed over half an hour. Near Lassen Peak, the southernmost
of the great volcanoes of the Cascade Range, there lies another field of recent volcanic activity
of even greater interest than the first. On 9 August 1881, Merrill B. Sherwood, Jr., from Buffalo,
N. Y., received a patent for a new phosphorescent compound that could be applied like a glowing
paint.

According to the author, the invention improved upon existing phosphorescent chemicals by expressing
a quality that allowed the chemical to absorb daylight and glow in the dark.
The enhanced type of luminescent material was able to withstand weather
conditions like regular paint, when affixed with a varnish or oil,
without losing its luminescence. While going speedly to the window at the back side on the hind part of his foot,
Hans told quite calmly that please believe it was a truth. Mirah said loudly to Mab that though
they had right opportunity, Mab was not given much care to the lesson. He asked him whether
he will sing it or Mirah himself should sing it for him. Mab become joyful and without observing
what was happened, told Mirah to sing it for him. All on a sudden, Mirah sang Lascia chio
pianga with full of melody and lament very samrtly.

At this time Hans stopped his walk for a while and turned to the structure around the fire
place, without looking to his mother. At last, when Mirah completed her last note and made
the final touch to the string of the musical instrument, she rushed to the home telling that
Ezra awaiting her. She qitely gave hand to Mrs.Meyrick and move back without looking her or
kissing her.

Any how, mother turn Mirah's face to hers and said pleasantly with soft words that God will bless
her. Mirah had the feeling that she was guilty of a crime against Mrs Meyrick by angrily reprimanding
Hans, and mixed with sorrows and felt that she had shown no thanks and not affirm positively.
As a result her friend was pricking of consciences. In this juncture, Hans had grasp suddenly
and opened the door. Mab said that what happened was a sister's soft deceitfulness and Hans would not
go walk home with Mirah. He was also sure that she will not do it and she was great fear onthat
day. Hans open door without caring her. Mirah said not anything to worried and opened the door
to outside and closed behind him and prohibit him from entering.
 The roof was lifted by horse, using a mast with a three quarters swing.
By using a hook for the wheel and two rings for handles, the barrows were raised as well.

The cost of concrete for materials were:

1 bbl. cement at $1.21 per
cubic yard. Trees began to grow upon the sand and gradually to encroach
upon the barren wastes about Cinder Cone. His only hope for later fame was to increase saless of
his poems to the lower class. He thought he had sometimes succeeded in doing this. Many people
had told him how much reading "Michael" and his other works had affected them. I concurred,
saying that my emotions would overcome me each time I read it.

His poem about his wife showed tender regard, sweetness, admiration, and respect--but also reserve
and delicacy. He felt bad that my uncle had written so little poetry because he thought him very
qualified due to his good ear, skill with meter, and his wonderful and happy way of expressing himself.
He said that he wrote so little because he took such great time and effort in developing his
meter. When he would experiment with a new meter, he put impossible amounts of time and labor
into the writing. He was an epicure as far as sound goes. Later he came to believe that he
had damaged his poetical powers and lost his delight in nature from
analysing his feelings so much instead of just enjoying them.

He claimed that he did not know how to finish "Christabelle," and his didn't think my unccle
had ever come up with a plan for it. He said he had composed the poem when they talked daily,
practically during the times they were together.

Furthermore, they communicated freely concerning all their literary projets and productions,
and he had never heard him say a word about his plan to finish the poem. He never doubted my uncle's
later assertions to the contrary; rather, he said that ideas of this
type went through his mind so rapidly and so vividly and impressed
him so much that he imagined he had actually arranged things that
he had barely thought about or worked on.

 The ancient custom was to kiss on the
mouth, that the Pietists have carefully preserved it.There was no other manner of greeting dames
in France, Germany, Italy, England; it was the right of cardinals
to kiss queens on the mouth, and even in Spain.What is starange is
singular is that they had not the same prerogative in France, where
ladies always had more liberty than anywhere else, but "every country
has its ceremonies," and there is no usage so general that chance
and custom have not provided exceptions.

"It is a displeasing custom," says Montaigne "and offensive to ladies, to have to lend their
lips to whoever has three serving-men in his suite, disagreeable though he be." This custom was,
nevertheless, the oldest in the world.

If it is disagreeable for a young and pretty mouth to stick itself out of courtesy to an old and
ugly mouth, there was a great danger between fresh, red mouths of twenty to twenty-five years old;
and that is what finally brought about the abolition of the ceremony
of kissing in the mysteries .

It is what caused women to be confined among the Orientals, so that
they might kiss only their fathers and their brothers; custom long
since introduced into Spain by the Arabs.

Behold the danger: there is one nerve of the fifth pair which goes from the mouth to the heart,
and hence lower down, with such delicate industry has nature prepared everything! The little
glands of the lips, their spongy tissue, their velvety paps, the fine skin, ticklish, gives
them an exquisite and voluptuous sensation, which is not without analogy with a still more hidden and
still more sensitive part. Modesty may suffer from a lengthily savoured
kiss.

It is to be remarked that the human species, the turtledoves and the pigeons alone are acquainted
with kisses; hence came among the Latins the word columbatÃ¬m, which
our language has not been able to render.

There is nothing of which abuse has not been made. The kiss, designed by nature for the mouth,
has often been prostituted to membranes which do not seem made for this usage.
We cannot honestly treat this interesting subject at greater length,
although Montaigne says: "One should speak thereof shamelessly: do
we utter 'killing,' 'wounding,' 'betraying,' but of that we dare not
speak but with bated breath.

LANGUAGES

There is no complete language, which can express all our ideas and all our sensations; their
shades are too numerous, too. Nobody can make known the precise degree of sensation he experiences.
One is obliged, for example, to designate by the general names of "love" and "hate" a thousand
loves and a thousand hates all different from each other; it is the same with our pleasures and
our pains. Thus all languages are, like us, imperfect.

They have all been made successively and by degrees according to our needs. It is the instinct
common to all men which made the first grammars without perceiving it.
 There are holes in the earth with bubbling mud at the bottom, cones from the tops
of which streams of muddy water issue, and ponds of mud, in some cases as thick as molasses,
in others thin and watery. The English built them. Their shipwrights and carpenters, descended
from a historic line of skilled craftsmen. Tiny crafts that were the primary transport through
the wild uncharted tidewaters of Virginia.

They had many uses, trade, fishing, exploration. Small handmade tools of iron have been found,
thought to have been used by the boat builders in Jamestown.
THE POTTER
In Jamestown in 1955 a site was discovered containing pottery kilns. Nearby was a collection
of utilitarian earthenware vessels, probably made between 1625 and 1640, which is clear proof
that pottery was in production in the area for more that 300 years.
Though utilitarian many of the pots have a certain symmetry and are
not completely drab. After giving birth to calves, a cow will probably
give milk from all four quarters. She should be allowed to go dry, but when leading up to giving
birth, the cow should be fed on a mix of food - not just dry food.
 

Every member of the legislature received a Pullman annual. Champagne flowed, not by the bottle,
but by the wet-load. Wickersham begged heard but paid no attention .Nor did he find out that it
was a put-up job and the bill finally lost in the Senate committee.
One of the familiar stories of Field's celebration of life in Denver was at the expense of Oscar
Wilde, on his widely advertised visit to America. This was when the aesthetic craze and the
inseparable exaggeration it were as an historical epic adventure
that unfolds in the Middle Ages.of maximum.

Anticipating Wilde's appearance in Denver by one day, and making shrewdly worded announcements
through the Tribune in keeping with his project, Field secured the finest character in town and
was driven through the streets in a caricature the quality of realism of the poet of the sunflower
and the flowing hair.

Field's talent as a wag and a mimic enabled him to assume and carry out the expression of bored
listlessness which was the popular idea of the leader of aesthetes. He imitates behavior or
actions of another of Wilde Ã  la Bunthorne in Gilbert and Sullivan's opera, "Patience," was
well calculated to deceive who were not in the secret. The popular idea of the leader of aesthetes
was that Field's talent as a wag and a mimic enabled him to assume
and carry out the expression of bored and lacking energy.

Nobody in the curious, whooping, yelling crowd assembled along the well-advertised route suspected
th fanciful, , and Field succeeded in making his exit from public gaze without betraying his
identity.
.

When Wilde turned up the next day he was not a mystic to learn that he had created a sensation
driving around Denver in the article of clothing of Bunthorne, while in reality travelling over
the prairie in a palace-car. It was Field himself who relieved his curiosity with narrative
of the experience of the joker lounging in the seat of honor in the landau.
Nobody in the curious, whooping, yelling crowd assembled along the well-advertised route suspected
the delusion, and after an hour's parade Field succeeded in making
his exit from public gaze without committing treason of his identity.

Wilde, it is related and saw nothing funny in the affair and was not provoked at it. His only
comment was that it was a a splendid advertisement for his lecture.

It was while in Denver that Field had numerous and flattering offers to leave journalism for
the stage, he was sorely tempted to make the experiment. In the natural qualifications for the
theatrical profession he was most richly endowed. In the arts of mimicry he was superior. He
had the adaptable face of a comedian, who tells stories and anecdotes
with skill and wit.

At a banquet or in a parlor he was an entertainer of truly fascinating parts. During his life
in St. Louis and Kansas City his inclination had led him to seek the society of the green-room,
and in Denver his position enlarged the circle of his acquaintance with the theatrical profession,
until it embraced almost every prominent actor and actress in America, and was subsequently extended
to include the more the celebrated artists of England. Among his favorites was Madame Bernhardt,
whose several visits to the United States gave him an opportunity for some of the most entertaining
sketches that ever delighted his Chicago readers.
 

"Poor Pollio, you are nothing but a lowly prisoner. You must reconsider. Think of your renowned
ancestors and what is keeping you from reaching their level of fame.
Pollio responded that he could not.
"You're an outcast.

Even the poorest Roman beggars live better than you do. They at least can feed themselves with
less work and embarassment, and they're not forced to live underground. Most of all, they live
in safety, without fear of the police. But you have to eke out a miserable living in the darkness,
in abject poverty and hunger, always alert to danger. What have you possibly gained by adhering
to your religion? What has this Jesus person ever done for you? I'll tell you: nothing. No,
worse than nothing, because he has taken all comfort from you--money,
your friends, the honors awarded to Roman citizens, and even the favor
of our Emperor.

You must turn from this man who deceives you."
Pollio shook his head no. "I cannot," he stated simply.
"I knew your father as brave soldier who was completely loyal to Rome. He gave his life for his
country when you were but a baby. You are his only heir.

If he only knew what was to befall his son and lead him down the wrong paths. Your mother, maddened
by grief, was fooled into believing the teaching of false men, and she in her ignorance pulled
you down with her.
Things would have been different if you father had not perished. He would have proudly passed his
legacy on to you, and your mother would have not fallen into a false
religion.

Does your father's memory mean nothing to you? You owe him your obedience. It is a sin to dishonor
his name, and that of your forefathers, in such a way. You took your family's golden reputation
and ground it into the mud.
Enough with your delusions. For the sake of your father and for the honor of your family, deny
your religion and return to your rightful place in society."

Pollio replied, "As long as my religion is rightful and pure, I cannot dishonor my family. You
may kill me, but you cannot make me turn from my Lord."
The official continued, "We have shown mercy and compassion to you
because of your family name and your youth.

It would go harder for you if you were a common prisoner; you would be offered a quick choice between
recanting or execution. We are trying to reason with you now, because we would hate to see such a distinguished
family line end due to the stubbornness of one prodigal son."
Pollio thanked him for showing consideration. "However," he continued, "my religion means more
to me than the weight of your words."
"Don't be rash and stupid, boy! You will bring down the wrath of the Emperor on your head." 
"I
fear the wrath of the Lamb much more."
"What are you saying? Just what do you mean by the wrath of the Lamb? I don't think you understand
what is going to happen to you."

Pollio said gravely, "I have already watched my friends and peers endure every injury you have
inflicted upon them. I hope I can face my future as courageously."
"Do you imagine you can withstand what you would face in the arena? The wild beasts that will
maul you?"
"I trust that God will stand by me. He will not abandon me when I need him most, He who has already
given himself for me."

"You might be put to the stake; have you thought about what it's like to burn to death?"
"I will not falter if that is to be my fate. In any case it will be over soon and I will be
free to spend eternity with God."

"You are a fanatic. Your susperstitious mumbo jumbo has driven you insane. Bravery is easier said
than done. What will you do when you realize you're staring death in the face?"
"I will look to the one who has given all for me. He gave himself
so I might live, and through him I will come to a better life than
this one, which will be taken from me." 
"You're dreaming. How can
a lowly Jew do what you claim." 
"He is the son of God, born into
human form. He also suffered physical death so we may achieve spiritual
life." 
"You fool, open your eyes--your beliefs have brought you
nothing but trouble. In the end, won't you see that you have made
a mistake?" 
"I will overcome death, with His strength," said Pollio,
evenly. "I am not afraid." Besides, the method by which the priests must
attest an oath openly has already been outlined and no deviation
is permitted.

The Bishop of Clermont and the rest of the Constitution advocates don't bring up any issues
except those involving spiritual matters. Since the Assembly has ordained the parameters of spiritual
issues and forces these doctrines upon the believers.

In other words, the Pope has the final say and what he says goes. If they don't attest to this
oath, they are degenerate. This law shall be enacted from head to toe, from the clergy to the
people. However the finest of his works is probably the Ode on the Poetical Character.
It unfolds his genius like the opening of a rose, letting its scent waft out slowly. As it is
read it emanates a golden cloud, it is encrusted with poetic nuance, it is as sweet as candy.
 

But this seemed quite natural on her side? and the fact that only those can find happiness in the
systems of moralists, who are no longer innocent should have not been remembered by me? â¦I was
at least thoughtful to end my preaching early. The outcome is now that the areas which
were once plentiful in fur-bearing animals are utterly devoid of
said creatures, much like the prairies upon which the once-plentiful
can no longer be seen. Pity indeed the image of the last of the buffalo!
 But he did not do this, and Daisy
started to sympathize, departing from her previous tortuous ideas.
It was now clear to her, slightly, what his inner conflict was. The only reason he was out here
now, pretending to read, was so that he could be close to her.

He had a slight air of an animal that is spurned and abused, but remains loyal to his master. Unceasing
loyalty was slowly being given a definition.
"I know I'm not to converse or to get a response," Willie whispered. "Don't let me intrude."
Daisy quickly glanced at him. 
"What if I said you weren't bothering
me?" 

The attack on Lord Loudon was essential because of his army cutting off the communication with
Caithness. The Prince was expecting more men and other provisions. Mr. Maxwell stated that "these plans
and preparations had been made for some time. However, they knew the execution of the initial attack
was going to be extremely dangerous."

All of Moray's fishing-boats were brought to Findhorn. However. the problem was to cross the
frith of Moray without being dectected by the English ships that
were cruizing around: If the English suspected the attacked, the plan
would not succeed.

Two or three North-country gentlemen, were employed and conducted their plans with great secrecy
and expedition. At Findhore, Everyone was ready when the orders were issued from Inverness
and the enemy did not suspect anything. In the beginning part of the night, Moir of Stoneywood set
out safely across the frith of Moray. They arrived in the morning at Tain, which was the place
where the Duke of Perth was ready. According to Mr. Maxwell, this group of men traveled through
thick fog without being seen. This was the best part of the Princeâs
expedition.

Under the direction of the Duke of Perth, they marched into the enemies' quarters. The men
succeed in dispersing Lord Loudonâs army. However, they did experience
some disappointments with The Duke of Perk. He was good natured as
well polite therefore he was easy to be duped by the enemy. The Library
of Abbotsford is full of unfinished manuscripts and letters which include ten volumes of correspondence
made by Sir.Walter with the famous writers of his time. In his Will he directed to give these
to his creditors. Lockhart his son-in -law also own a great number of letters from Sir.Walter,
and Mrs. Terry, Wife of his intimate friend also possess baronet's correspondence with the late
Mr.Terry. Mrs. Terry also own a tragedy written by Sir.Walter for her eldest son,Walter Scott
Terry and Sir.Walter intended it as legacy for his first appearance on the stage.  A competent
biographer will be able to portrait Sir.Walter's acquaintances with the materials mentioned
above and his autobiographical sketches prefixed to his works.Mr.Allan
Cunningham was bonded with truth,kindly feeling and tinged throughout
with a delightfully poetic enthusiasm.Mr.Ballantyne, has promised
a memoir of Sir.

Walter as he was the printer of almost all works of him and the poet respected him for his
taste and good sense.But the public rely on Lockhart. Ettrick Shepherd announced tribute and virtues
of his contemporary.He claimed that he is among the five people in the world who understand
his character and his mental portrait will not dispute with the original.  Hog is indebted
to Sir Walter for many valuable suggestions and he wrote in his dedication
of the Mountain Bard to Scott that may the generous heart be blessed
as he praised him for his advises and the time he spend to correct
his notes.

His suggesions were as the song of parent when he sung for the baby in the cradle
 

When the game was over, the winner received the appropriate prize in a formal presentation.
Everybody cheered and then the hard-boiled eggs were shared around. There was a lot of laughing
and cheering when the raw eggs were gathered up and then everyone went to the local inn where they
were cooked in several different ways and consumed with gusto. The Diatessaron
appears a second time when it was mentioned by Eusebius in his Epistle. This version was written
by Ammonius. Finally there is a third very version very similar to the one by Elias mentioned
by Bar-Salibi. 

But a world was about me as genuine as this; it had possibly habitually been there; in that instant
I was first cognizant of it. I knew, as if a doorway had been opened, what paradise means--a
status of being. And I knew another thing more personal--that, without inquiry, it was right with
those I considered I had lost and that the repugnance which appeared blackest I have no require
to dread. I will not state that I glimpsed them or learned or affected them, but I was with them.
I realise, but I can't make you understand.

I notified Dick an hour before that if I could accept as factual they were dwelling, that I
should ever have them afresh, I should be flawlessly happy. That's factual now. I accept as
factual it, and I am--perfectly happy." The listener groaned uncontrollably.

"I understand your thought," the referee responded the sound, and
his eyes were like lights as he turned them in the direction of the
man.

"But you're wrong--my brain is not unhinged. You'll see. After what I've gone through, after
opposite eternity without wish, what are meagre years? I can wait. I know. I am--perfectly happy."

Then
the man who heard increased from his seating and came and put a hand softly on the shoulder
of the referee, looking down at him gravely.

"I don't realise you very well, John," he said, "but I'm pleased of anything--of anything"--his
voice went suddenly. "Will you delay for me here a couple of minutes? I'm going dwelling and I'll
be back. I believe I'll spend the evening with you if you don't object."

"Object! Wait!"

The referee looked up in shock, and with that he smiled. "I see. Surely. I'd like to have
you here. Yes, I'll absolutely wait."

Outside in the auditorium one might have learned the brother-in-law state a reduced phrase or
two to Miller as the man assisted him on with his coat; then the
front doorway closed gently, and he was gone, and the referee sat
solely, his head hurled back contrary to his seating, his face luminous.
 

"It could be that you people were bothered by it, too, but I know I've been uneasy about it." He
smiled at Betty and said, "I think you should probably show him the final letter from his dad.
I think that will let me off the hook. And I do certainly want to return to my home."
 

By the 25th most of the company had convened on the west bank of the Big Black River, near the
train tracks. Tomorrow they'd need cars for Vicksburg.
The regiment was required now to report at St. Louis, and as planned, on the 26th, they set
off from Vicksburg on the steamboat Missouri for their predetermined destination. After arriving
on the 31t, they were commanded to march on to Fort Snelling, and
on August 1st they boarded the steamboat Brilliant for St. Paul.

Private W. Smith's lifeless body was discovered on the deck two days later, and he was left in
Burlington, Iowa, for a proper burial. On the 7th they arrived, and were politely greeted by
the locals. After being received, they continued on to Fort Snelling. Literally, making the most noise in opposition to it that
you are able, especially in public meetings. There is a memory a moan moan, a hiss and a whistle,
even from a goose. On all these occasions do everything possible to create a disturbance,
to resemble a popular demonstration against the measure.

Besides scream, yell and scream, I must say that another fix on another platform, one alteration
of the reporter's table, another terrible of the ladies, and other mobbing the president, would
be desirable. He set to work together with all your zeal and energy to carry out the suggestions
of our Central Committee for defeat of a bill, if passed, inflict a blow at the funeral home
as great as the gift that is attributed to the widow and the orphan - who, of course, can only
consider as clients.

The Metropolitan Burials bill will rob us every penny we taking advantage of the helplessness
of the affected families. And figure out what our loss would therefore be in the beautiful
language of St. Demetrius, the silversmith, "Gentlemen, this art know that we have our wealth."

Miss Fenimore Cooper's (unpublished) "RURAL HOURS."
FIRE IN THE FOREST.
Observation of an old trunk without branches of the largest size,
in a remarkable position, where it appeared that a broken column,
which came to examine him.

The axis of pink, without a bend or a branch, at the height of forty feet, where he had been
abruptly started, probably in a storm. The tree was a chestnut, and the bark of a clear, spotless
grayShe walks, we saw an opening near the ground, and to our surprise found the hollow trunk, and
completely charred on the inside, black like a chimney, from the root to the point where it
was interrupted. It often happens that the fire slips into the heart of an old tree, so, for
an opening near the roots, and then is gone, the interior, leaving
only a gray outer layer.

One would not expect the crust to leave in such cases, but the wood in the heart appears to be
more flammable than external growth. Whatever the cause, such lines are common on our mountains,
gray without, charred inside.
There is wood, in fact, much charred in our forests, the fires spread over the hills are common
here, and sometimes do much damage. If the flame is lit once enough in dry weather, which will
run in all directions as the wind varies, sometimes burning for weeks together, until they have
destroyed more than a hundred miles of forests, wilting vegetables,
destruction wood already cut, and greatly injured many trees that
do not consume. for several years in the month of June, there was
a fairly large fire on the eastern range of hills, which lasted for
ten days or two weeks, extending several miles in different directions.

It was the first major fire of the kind had ever seen, and of course we watched their progress
with great interest, but the show was very different from what we had expected.
 "There is a straw tick," said Margarita,
where you can sleep, and no wiser. "I gave. The good woman warmed some soup, and the storm
did not fall, I lay down to rest - to rest, nay Delessert shouted, jumping madly to their feet,
and the furious pace here and there - the rest ' the demons! My blood was on fire, and the anger,
hatred, despair, and blew the fire that consumed by turns.

I thought it had been ransacked by rogue mercenaries safe sleep, as he thought, in a dozen yards
of the man who had ruined - sleep safely beyond the room containing the secretaire in the writing
of the mortgage, which had been deposited was swindled '----
"Oh, father," gasped the child.
"Shut up, boy, and you will know everything! May be that I dreamed all this, because I think
the creak of a door, and a stealthy step on the stairs, I woke up, but perhaps that too was part
of the dream. However, I wake up at last and I got up and looked out the cold night. The storm
had passed, and the moon had temporarily broken through the heavy clouds for which she was surrounded.
Margarita had said I could let out, and decided to leave at once.

I was doing, where, looking around, I realized that the notary's office door was ajar. At once
a demon whispered, that while the law was restored, he was still blind and deaf as always -
I could not see or hear in the silence deep - and could easily confuse the usurer cheating
after all. Quickly and quietly, that plunged into the open door - entered. secrÃ©taire the
notary, Antoine, was open! I looked with trembling hands for writing, but could not find it.
There was money in the drawers, and I - I think I should have had some - not maybe, I do not know
how - when I heard, or what I, a rumor and not far away.

I looked frantically around, and saw clearly in the bedroom of the notary - whose door had not
noticed before, was partially open - the shadow of the figure of a man clearly drawn by the
light of Moon low in the ground. I ran out of the room, and outside the home, with the speed
of a madman, and here - here I am! "That said, threw himself on a chair and covered her face
with her hands.
"That money is a crack," Le Bossu, who had listened with horror the
story moved to the celebration of his father.

"You did not have one, you said, when at the tavern.
"Money!" Ah, it can be as I said ---- Thunder of heaven! "Cried the unhappy once again standing
up fiercely," I'm lost!

"I'm afraid so," said a police commissioner, who had come suddenly, accompanied by several gendarmes
- 'if it is true, as we suspect, that you are the murderer of Destouches
notary. 
The murderer of Destouches notary! Le Bossu heard, but
these words, and when he regained consciousness, he found himself
alone, save for the presence of a neighbor who had been called to
their aid. With a quality of thought and a torrid persuasiveness, to which
both Playwright and Lavater contain signatory, he declared the conditions
of the renaissance of the people--the improved upbringing of youth
by educating them and the requisite for the lavish to resolve this
by providing monetary help.

 She stood within the react, her hands clasped rear her
back, her shoulders pressed against the wall, her feet braced out. Her face was silver with
the wind and her own thoughts; as a flame within a allied day of
tempest glows and brightens onto a hearth, so she appeared towards
glow, standing there, and towards breathe out energy.

It was the former moment Ballantrae had toured that wine-seller's, the former moment he had
sighted the wife; and his eyes were true towards her.
 I have discovered the plantings of some humming-birds full of
little soft-bodied arachnids, and numerous other birds feed on them. Stinging ants, like bees and
wasps, are nearly resembled by a owner of other insects; really,
when I discovered any bug supplied with exceptional entails of protection
I looked for imitative types, and was not ever let down in finding
them.

Stinging ants are not only nearly made a replicate in pattern and movements by arachnids but by
species of Hemiptera and Coleoptera, and the resemblance is often magnificently close.* (* Amongst
the longicorn beetles of Chontales, Mallocera spinicollis, Neoclytus Oesopus, and Diphyrama singularis,
Bates, all nearly resemble biting ants when going about on dropped
logs.) All over the world wasps are imitated in pattern and movements
by other bugs, and in the tropics these mimetic types are endless.

In numerous situations the bug imitating is so broadly taken, in the usual pattern of the alignment
to which it pertains, from that of the bug imitated, that it is tough to envisage how the first
steps in the method of imitation took place. Looking although at the immense kind of bug life
in the tropics, and recalling that in early tertiary times almost
the entire world was in the identical favourable status as considers
warmth (vegetation, as asserted by Heer, expanding to the poles),
and should have sustained a huge number of species and genera that
were decimated throughout the glacial time span, we should presume
that, in that large kind of types, it occasionally appeared that two
species belonging to distinct instructions rather resembled each other
in pattern or colouration, and that the resemblance was step-by-step
expanded, when one species had exceptional entails of defence, by
the other being availed the more almost it advanced it in appearance.

It is to be commented that the types imitated have habitually some kind of protection contrary
to insectivorous birds or mammals; they are supplied with bites or obnoxious odours or tastes,
or are exceedingly swift in flight; excepting where inanimate environment is imitated for concealment.
Thus I had an opening of verifying in Brazil that some birds, if not all, decline the Heliconii
butterflies, which are nearly resembled by butterflies of other families and by moths.
 This little town was devastated
by the sea and left in ruins. The incoming boats must now go to Walderswick, a small village
near Swole, because of the dangers of the debris left behind on the shore. It became so perilous,
some of the local fishermen made up a song about it.
"Swoul and Dunwich, and Walderswick, all go in at one lousie creek."
This "lousie creek" is the river between the three.

The atlas maker, unaware of the tragic events, referred to this river as a good harbor and
a naval substation, but soon this information soured his reputation. Nobody knows why there was darkness
all around. The steamer hooted as if it is going to die down.

People were not in a position to understand if there was a problem with the steamer as there was
still time left for midnight to set in. There was darkness around and no one was in a position
to predict the reason. Finally the mate appeared and asked "why there was darkness in the cabin?"
 

Adorned with split bamboo and partially shrouded in mats, the canoe offered shelter from the
hot sun during the day and the cool night dew. Typically, one will steer while the other row or
paddle. However, when the wind works in their favor, they sail.
 The as yet unequaled population boom which occured in the first portion
of the 1800's was replaced with an increasing drop in the birth-rate. This will begin to have
a marked effect on social conditions, especially given that the heretofore deecreasing death rate
will soon table.

With this anticipated stagnant population level, Europe will enjoy
much better conditions, and the hope of tackling social reform issues
will meet with greater chances for success.

Instead of desperately competing and fighting, the population will resume traditional enjoyment
of the finer things in life. Once again, people's lives will be valued, and humans will reserve their
praise for the peacemakers over the warmongers.
 214, 69, 700, 910, 21 - (words necessary were completed code ABC).
This message was sent via Brussels or Paris, the German Admiralty
Intelligence Department in Berlin and told them that the warships
were at sea or on arrival Rossyth.

Code contained phrases like this:
"Current rumors." "Entry". "Exit." "Clearing of action." "They lowered nets defense." "Land fortifications
are manned." "Protective maneuvers are carried by sea." "Coal is transported by rail." "Remarkable
influx of reservists." "Mine flelds being determined." "Everything is quiet, nothing significant
to report." "Liners occur."

Incidental finding of this code, of course, settled all further argument. I called no defense witnesses
except two or three personal knowledge of each of them I put this question:
"What is your knowledge of my position as regards England?"
They all said that even if I was a spy in service of a foreign government, I certainly did
not reveal any personal feelings or animosity toward Britain.

However I thought could help the cause for leniency. The jury was not more than half an hour. I
was found guilty of endangering the security of the British Empire and under the new law was
directed against German spies have been liable to seven years servitude "criminal. Even when
my spirits were down. I've had what Americans call "a hunch."
Just before He, Chief Justice, summed up, an aristocrat, gray-clad
English, who had never been in court before, appeared and was kindly,
almost impressive, made at the bank.

I noticed that the Chief Justice left it with grease and had conversation about two minutes'
whispered. Lots of people
do not listen to half of the sounds that go on around them, and they could learn a lot from
them. Those who study music should be the most attentive, as the way to learn music is to learn
how to listen. Schumann, a composer famous for writing very little, clearly felt his rules for
young musicians were very important. never influenced or attempted to inspire
a ballot, and hereafter many, and not only my bear tenants, have asked me to whom, they should
furnish theirs."

Nor was he utterly existing at gavel jockey, though an appearance would have been at the superintend
of the (at that lastingness) Regent.
 The numerous chimneys in the iron making and other industrial centres do drive
offthe vitiated air and fresh and pure air is replaced. But when pestilence was raging in the
pleasant quarters of high profile Clifton, the inhabitants of this area had no course but
to migrate to the low-lying parish of St. Philips, which was not so clean. Briston is the area
where the chimneys threw out black air and also reduced the mortality
rate considerably as compared to the fashionable quarter.

 Young people, with a mournful face, speaking in the
twilight of their disappointed hopes, and wondering if the evening
will bring customers to small items have spent all their free time
in the summer, hoping to add a large amount of depleted treasury to
the town, when suddenly a child voice heard at the door, "I want to
play my violin for some dinner."

No one saw that little boy with his pleading eyes, and his rich, soft
voice and broken his foreign accent, while standing half-coated chill
that night in November, can ever forget the image.

They were at a loss to know what to do. They said: "But we do not want to hear your violin where
you are coming from, and. What is your name, and where are you going? It's night and where
you sleep?"

"I come from Billing, he said, holding his hands and the little brown shows scratches and said,"
I big brothers beat me and scratching me, and I run away. "
"But where you come from?" half a dozen eager girls asked all at once.
"Me not know my sleeping under the cart and me very cold I can not play my violin for a dinner
..?"
Tears began to run not only in the eyes of a homeless, but the tissues are in demand among all
those who stood listening to the story, oblivious sales or profits at the moment, and intent
only on feeding a little orphan, who was standing in front of them.
"Come," they said, "and you will have some dinner, and where to stay
to night?"

"Me not know my mother died, my father is a return payment, and I cry .."
Interest has grown with every word he uttered, and excitement ran
high among the enthusiastic young girls, each of whom fed and petted
him a little man to face beamed with happiness.

He never fell into the hands of as soon as possible, and his sorrow, and all childish sorrows,
melted away in the first rays of goodness, love. He was placed on the flower-stand, and there
among the flowers in the warm, cheerful room, he recalled his beautiful Italy, a country of flowers
and notes of his little tent attracts visitors, so as the evening wore on, Dean found his friends
and filling the pockets of all his pennies, and his eyes filled with joy. Pointing to one of the
ladies, "he said in a mournful tone," No I do not like, no smile
on me, but it - and my mother died, and I cry.

"
But the evening wore away. The flowers are fading, people are leaving one by one, and the hall
will soon be abandoned. What then will become a bad Dine? It was decided at length, after much
consultation, that his place in the Orphans' Home.
The morning dawned and brought one of those clear, crisp November
day that are common in our New England after rain, and Sam was taken
to their new home.

The Home for Orphan Boys a CMS, cheerful home, and when Jimmy was introduced to the type of
man who is in charge and said that he would be a good boy should have at home, have dinner
and supper, and a place to sleep as well as other little boys , he
gave vent deliberately look around the sunny room, and then thrust
his chubby little brown hand in the pocket of his torn, worn-out pants,
and pulled further pennies that were Snug tucked away in their depths,
and grateful smile, his black eyes pretty dance for joy, he gave them
the superintendent, saying, "Give me a home, I give you pennies I
was so 'fraid I freeze to death .."

It was touching to see how Sam kept him a little old fiddle. It seemed to be a link between the days
in Italy, where he lived simple, happy life with his mother who seemed to love dearly, and a
new home that has promised to give him shelter. His little old fiddle was a source of entertainment
for many children, whose melody is easily caught, and soon became a great favorite. Visitors
who came to Home always asked first for Dean, Italian boy, and rarely go without leaving something
for the little man.

As the days and weeks wore away, Sam continuous improvement in mind and manners, and developed
all the sweetness of heart and disposition, as he promised on that November morning, when he gave
'his pennies for the home. " At the end of five years he left home and are looking for a place where
he could earn his living.
Adopted and the memory of the little River is fading from the hearts of those who befriended
him, when a Saturday flight this afternoon stillness was broken by the sound of approaching
feet, and the family sat on the broad piazza of the pleasant country
house.

 

At that point, it was clear that another hit on the giant might just resolve the matter, so he
hefted his weapon and, gathering all of his strength, tossed it in the direction of his opponent's
face. There was a collision, and the impact was sufficient to drive the hammer deep into the
side of the enemy's head. But the opponent was entirely unphased by this blow. The giant, who
had a name that will be disclosed later, fluttered his eyelids and
seemed to rouse from sleep.

He brushed his face with a hand and said something to the effect that he felt maybe a swallow
had perched there for a moment or some leaf or grass had settled there. Then he faced the hammer-wielder,
asking "So, how sleepy are you? Isn't time to get ready for the day and start our morning
routines? I hear you have a short commute. Your friends seem to have the notion that I'm not the
shortest person around, but if you go on to the city you'll find I'm not the tallest either.
I think, therefore, that you should cultivate a better approach to dealing with the people you
meet there. Not all of them will be as patient with you as I have been this morning. Maybe
you should avoid going to the city at all, really.

If you decide that's what you want to do, though, it is over that way in the direction of the rising
sun. I need to be headed towards the upper polar regions myself, so I'll get moving now." Then he
gathering up his things and rotated on his heel and started to walk away in the direction he
had chosen.

At this point, the hammer-wielder, who was named Thor, took the giant's directions but not his
advice and made his way towards the city, which was called Utgard. About midday he arrived at
the walls of that city, which were in the middle of a wide flat area. Those walls were so
high that he and his friends could barely see the top of them, and
the gate was barred to them and secured with prison-like iron cylinders
every few feet.

Though Thor was a pretty strong person, it was unlikely that he could move the whole weight of this
gate even if it wasn't locked. The bars, though, were far enough apart that he and his fellows
could just walk through them as they themselves were gates, and that's how they got in. Once
inside, they could see a great building of the sort that usually houses ruling authorities, and
they made their way through the open door of that edifice. Inside they found a bunch of huge
male figures sitting on pews

.
 The recent are arrived as a lenghthen framework of powerful tips of bamboo, with a height
of about hundred feet.

The home of birds are seperated from the the stony matter with a tip ending in a small iron instrument
with thin flexible blade. A wax candle is kept farthest from it and the same is placed with guano
of many feet fence and are picked up in bags. The white nests are collected three times in
an year with a gap of one month and the black nests pick up only two times in a year. Fortunately,
about three tons of black nests are collected in a year from a big
den.

It is interesting that each den especially the big ones with natural markings, is seemed to
be the asset of certain persons which hold it during the period of their birth to death and hand
over the same to the inheritors.

[Note 2: However, "Peter's Pence" was initiated by the NII, the king of the West Saxons, around 690!]

Now this is a very interesting, and were taken into account by our modern legislators escaped
much of unwise legislation, ie the distinction between a sin and a crime. A sin is against the Church,
or against one's conscience, matter, therefore, for the priest, or spiritual adviser. A crime
is an offense against other men, that is, against the state in which
everyone is worried.

Under the wise legislation of the twelfth century all matters were sins, which referred to the conscience,
remained in the church to prevent or punish. For the same reason, usury was a matter for the
priest - because it was under the doctrines of the Bible as a sin.

This idea prevailed until the early legislation of the colony of Massachusetts, though no doubt
many things that were considered sins would now be considered as crimes such as bigamy, for
example. The distinction is, however, a valid and often have occasion to refer to it. We will
see that the defect of much of our modern law - the laws of prohibition, for example - is that
they try to treat as crimes, as crimes against the state, matters are only sins, crimes against
the individual conscience or which commits them.
Today, all the American constitutions say that a militia is the natural
defense of a state of free men.

It is interesting, therefore, to find, almost a century after the Norman Conquest. In 1181, the
Criminal de Armas, which revived the old Saxon "Fyrd," the word of what we now call the militia,
and twenty years before that, "scutage" replaces the military. For loads of the feudal system,
compulsory military service and standing armies, our ancestors were
opposed from the beginning.

In a sense, scutage was the beginning of the taxes, but it was only a commutation for military service,
both as a man of today can pay a substitute to go to war at the time of the project. General taxation
first appeared in 1188 in the famous Saladin tithe, the first historical
case of taxation of property, unlike a burden placed upon the feudal
land.

The purpose of this tax was to raise money for the crusade against Saladin. It was followed five
years later by a tax of one quarter of the income of the person or property to the rescue of
King Richard I have gone to the crusade against Saladin, and captured on his return by his
good friend and Christian ally, the Holy Roman Emperor.

It is interesting to note that the value of the king in those days was considered just one quarter
of the common wealth of England. John was less expensive, but he was captured. It imposed a tax
of ten years after the first part of session on the barons, and a
thirteenth in every man.

In 1213 two important things happened. The highlight of domination by the Roman Church is reached
when the handed King John of England to the Pope, and took it back as a fief of the Pope for
a tribute of a thousand marks. The same year, another early test method claims was abolished
by the Lateran Council - the view of God.

This was the only remaining Saxon method.

Norman trial by battle had already been replaced by a jury trial, and from this moment, in
practice, no other method that is still a jury, although the trial by battle was not abolished
by law until the nineteenth century.
And then we come to the Magna Carta. The first time it was awarded in 1215 by Juan, but the letter
is that it always says enacted ten years later, under Henry III.

Were almost identical, but the important omission in the letter of Henry was in regard to "scutage"
("no other help than the three customary feudal aids are usually imposed without the consent
of the kingdom"), which, of course, is the principle discussed above,
first put in writing in the letter of John.

The barons claimed it as part of the unwritten law. But Henry III in his letter that cleverly
left - which is a trick that legislatures continue to play a day. 

It is essential to treat box privy with some effective larvicide. Not only to treat them, but
to do so thoroughly and regularly. The fecal matter located in these privies is rarely used
for fertilizing purposes and can be treated, liberally of course, with Borax.
 As we talk, we fell that the burden in our heart grew heavier. The Matron had
said that she thought that she came to do a Christian work for the girls, and it was her purpose, but
then she realize that it is not what is expected from her and she is not to ask any question
about it. Such a work as sending girls over to the Lock Hospital, under the order of the chief
inspector, make her feel that she can no longer stay because she
cannot approved the purpose of her work.

 Le Bossu silently offered him vin ordinaire. It was
eagerly swallowed, although Delessert's hand shook so that he could scarcely sustain the pewter
carafe to his lips. 'Something has happened,' said Le Bossu presently.
'Morbleu!--yes.

That is,' added the father, glance himself, 'something might have happened, if---- Who's there?'

'Only the airstream shaking the door. What might have happened?' persisted the son.
'I will tell you, Antoine.

I set off for Strasbourg yesterday, to see Destouches once again, and plead him to accept the
assignats in part payment at least. He was not at home. MarguÃ©ritual, the old servant, said he was
consumed to the cathedral, not long since reopened. Well, I found the usurer just coming out
of the great western entry, heathen as he is, looking as virtuous as a pilgrim. I accosted
him, told my chore, begged, prayed, stormed! It was all to no rationale, excepting to magnetize
the spot and notes of the passers-by.

Destouches went his way, and I, with fury in my empathy, betook myself to a lilac-shop--Le Brun's.
He would not even change an assignat to take for what I drank, which was not a little; and I
hence owe him for it. When the gendarmes empty the house at last, I was near crazed with rage
and juice. I must have been so, or I should never have dead to the Rue BÃ©chard, mandatory
myself once more into the notary's spirit, and--and'----

'And what?' quivered the infantile man, as his father abruptly clogged, startled as before into
silence by a swift rattling of the silly door.

'And what?'
'And abused him for a cruel-hearted rogue, as he is. He planned me
away, and threatened to call the lookout. I was flinging out of the
house, when MarguÃ©service twitched me by the cover, and I stepped
aside into the kitchen. âIt
was not possible to shoot a gun in the bottom of the cavern, even though gunpowder can be exploded
even in carbonic acid by the introduction of a heat sufficient to
decompose the nitre, and therefore surround the mass in an atmosphere
of oxygen gas, yet the spark would be too slight an augmentation of
temperature for this purpose.â Similar example, but on a bigger
scale, are shown in the extinct crater in the Island of Java called
âGueovo Upas,â the Poison-Valley.

Surrounded by precipitous rocks, it is a level about half a mile wide. Proving fatal to any animal
venturing nigh, carbonic acid gas from various part is discharged.

As a result, the ground is littered with countless skeletons.

The general belief in Europe was once that this valley gave root to the famous figment about
the upas-tree. Also in Java, there is another extinct crater. In this crater, the exhaled vapours
are equally deadly. There is a strange effect on the rotting carcasses subjected to the gasses.
Instead of being reduced to skeletons, their carcasses have the bones dissolved. All the vapours
leave behind is the skin, hair, and nails by, preserved from decay.

Near the volcano of Talaga Bodas, is this remarkable crater. The most remarkable of the all the
extinct volcanoes in the world, is the Dead Sea. The compilation of salt and bitter water has
depressed the level of its surface 1312 feet below the Mediterranean. This indicates an enormous
subsidence.

Well-watered everywhere, the garden of the Lord, like the land of the Egypt which has became
to be known as the Dead Sea, occupies the site of what was previously the plain of Jordan.
The Vale of Siddim, one part of it, was full of pits filled with slime, the only evidence of volcanic
action. Standing in plain sight were the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord, it is said,
showered upon them fire and brimstone from heaven. Although it appears that these may have
fell onto the cities from the atmosphere from the earth.

The phenomenon therefore, most likely looked like, in the first instance, those of Jorullo;
but the disaster seems to have broken like the last great outbreak of the volcano in Timor--the
whole of the plain having been engulfed and replaced by the salt lake, which so clearly indicates
the nature of its origin based on the depressed level.
 Much of what I have never seen. It is kept in the boxes that was sent to the academy. "Where
is the scientific unit? Where?
"The students' rooms are not big enough. Two students live day and night in a small camera.
The passages between the rooms are too narrow. Recitation rooms are too small and not well ventilated.
Teachers do not have the adequate support, and could easily obtain much higher wages for a lot
less work in other institutions. For this reason, the Academy calls for increased envelope. You
need $ 150,000 for its new buildings. promise has so far received
only $ 36,000.

"After the seventh of March speech, Daniel Bostonians Webster said," You have conquered the weather,
which now has nothing to do, but the conquest of their prejudices.

" It meant that New England had beaten the laws of nature that had given them little except
the ice and granite, and there was nothing for them except to conquer their prejudices against
the system of slavery. Now the teachers of Abbot Academy has been conquered, and there is nothing
for them except to submit to the laws of nature. You can not submit to these laws.
 I was astonished to find his feet swollen and bleeding and his hands
likewise, his side pierced, and his ribs flayed with whip cuts. "Good Heavens!" I said to him,
"is it possible for a just man, a sage, to be in this state?

I have just seen one who was treated in a very hateful way, but i cannot compare between his
torture and yours. Wicked priests and wicked judges poisoned him; Is it by priests and judges
that you have been so cruelly assassinated?"  He answered with much
courtesy--"Yes."

"May i know who were these monsters?"
"They were the hypocrites."
"Ah! that says everything; I understand by this singleI was astonished to find his feet swollen
and bleeding, his hands likewise, his side pierced, and his ribs flayed with whip cuts. "Good Heavens!"
I said to him, "is it possible for a just man, a sage, to be in this state? I have just seen
one who was treated in a very hateful way, but there is no comparison between his torture
and yours. Wicked priests and wicked judges poisoned him; is it by priests and judges that you
have been so cruelly assassinated?"  He answered with much courtesy--"Yes."
"And who were these monsters?"
"They were hypocrites."

"Ah! that says everything; I understand by this single word that they must have condemned you
to the ultimate death. Had you then proved to them, as Socrates did?As the Moon was not a goddess,
and that Mercury was not a god?"
"No, i am sure these planets were not in question.

My compatriots did not know at all what a planet is; They were all arrant ignoramuses. Their
superstitions were quite different from those of the Greeks."
"You wanted to teach them a new religion, then?"
"Not at all; I said to them simply--'Love God with all your heart
and your fellow-creature as yourself, for that is man's whole duty.'
Judge if this precept is not as old as the universe; judge if I brought
them a new religion.

I did not stop telling them that I had come not to destroy the law but to fulfil it; I had
observed all their rites very well; circumcised as they all were, baptized as were the most zealous
among them, like them I paid the Corban; I observed the Passover as they did, eating standing
up a lamb cooked with lettuces.

I and my friends went to pray in the temple; my friends even frequented this temple after my death;
in a word, I fulfilled all their laws without a single exception."
"What! these wretches could not even reproach you with swerving from their laws?"
"No, without a doubt."
"Why then did they put you in the condition in which I now see you?"
"What do you expect me to say! they were very arrogant and selfish.

They saw that I knew them; they knew that I was making the citizens acquainted with them; they
were the stronger; they took away my life: and people like them will
always do as much, if they can, to whoever does them too much justice."
"But did you say nothing, do nothing that could serve them as
a pretext?"  
"To the wicked everything serves as pretext."  
"Did
you not say once that you were come not to send peace, but a sword?"
"It is a copyist's error; I told them that I sent peace and not

it happened as he cried "He lives yet! for I could not find it in my heart to fulfil your commands".
The King was relieved and had it to be announced that Son might return and would again be taken
into favor all over his dominions.
Meanwhile the Princess had ordered a road that goes to her castle of pure shining gold to be
built , and she told her attendants to let anyone who rode up that road to be adminnted in the
castle as he is the right person. On the other hand anyone who too the side road were on no
account allowed in the castle.

When, therefore, the time came round which the Princess had mentioned to the youngest Prince,
the eldest Brother rushed to her castle to claim her as his bride and the kingdome besided. But
as he reached the golden road he thought it would be a shame to ride
on it, so he took the side road and therefore got denied access by
the guards as he was not the right person.

Soon afterward the second Prince also set out, and he, like his elder borther, avoided the golden road
didn't have his horse set its feet on it. When he came to the gate the guards refused him admittance,
and told him he was not the right person. The YOungest prince however who had been wandering in
the forest finally remembered that the time is up and set out for the castle. He rode up straight
on the golden road as he was too distracted thinking of his beloved princess
 "Aren't they sent
here to spread the gospel to them and to be spirits of ministering to all those who shall inherit
salvation?"

When the good designs of God are fell into by happy parents, and with depending on him in the
usage of omnisiently appointed means, in the preparation of a group of people to himself, what
a beautiful mixture this becomes to complete his wonderful purposes. Not just God--the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but also the hosts of angels, and all righteous people by their
faith and works, help this wonderful design along.
Outside of the ordinary realm, when the fog that blinds us from the
unknown is lifted, how strange the feelings parents would have towards
their mission here. In Norfolk, if a ring made of nine sixpences is freely
given from a person of one sex to a person of the other sex, this
ring is considered to be an anti-epilepsy charm.

Occasionally, I see nine sixpences brought to silversmiths in order to be made into rings,
but thirteen and a half d are not usually tendered to the silversmiths and it seems that no
threehalfpences are collected as payment. One silversmith I talked to said that this often happens
and he often makes thick silver rings.

He said that he never takes the trouble to make them from sixpences.
I have also heard that a sole of a left shoe, from a person of same age, but opposite sex, to another
person that is burned, cures St. Anthony's fire.

I have seen this work, but I imagine it works because of some astringent property of the ash.

*****
The recent editors have replaced "runaways" with "unawares", due to the absurdity of the word
"runaways". It seems to me that "unawares" is just as absurd though.

A certain Mr. Singer supposes that the real reading is this --
"That rumourers' eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."
Certainly an improvement as observers report what they see and rumourers
report what they hear.

However, with this being said, "rumourer's eyes" seems inappropriate. It just so happens that
I have come up with a new reading of the passage, inspired by the combination of the letters
in "runaways". That new reading is this --
"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing Night. That rude day's eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to
these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."
Juliet makes a reference in an earlier speech that makes it clear. It seems odd to me that it
was overlooked. She asks the "fiery-footed steeds" to bring in "cloudy
night".

Then she asks night to close the curtain so that day's eyes may wink and that darkness come,
so that Romeo can get to her safely.

Note, too, that this epithet civil, when taken into account with the preceding connections, is
most certainly a time of "paltering with us in a double sense."
I believe that these corrections, naw into ded and "runaways" into
"rude day's", are simple and necessary that probably resulted from
a misprint. Here it was, these 3 guys on the carpet before the Colonel, getting
an ass chewing like you've never seen.

After it was all said and done, the Colonel said they were a damned
site to see with all of their hoseplaying, and grab-assing, and if
ever they unplugged their heads from their asses, then they would
see that this war was not a practical joke.

He told Lee and Smith that Captain Seeley would deal with them, and that he would report Doran
to the proper quarters. He then turned his attention on me and said that it appeared that I had
been the victim of a practical joke and that "You are so damned innocent that I figure you
are temporarily unfit to hold onto a Corporal's warrant, so you can consider yourself reduced
to the ranks."

We can not have Corporals that if some comedian told them the Germans was now one of our allies,
that they would climb into the German trenches and shake their hands.

Al you would not believe it, but when it was all over with, I could barely contain the laughter,
because I came out of it O.K. The real joke was on Smith, Lee and
Doran because I got what I wanted because I did not want to be the
Corporal.

That would mean that I could not pal around with the boys and be their pal, when I had to give
them orders. I just wanted to remain one of them and we all remain equals.

Of course there was never a moment the whole trip when Lee, Doran or Smith had me fooled, because
just one glance at them you knew they were all smart asses trying to pull something over on
someone.

I figured two could play at that game, and I gave them as much as they dished out to me. I figured
the games not over until the ninth inning and the last man laughing has the best of it.
 

In the middle of the River of reflection that rushed upon me, was prominent image of the poor
Pendlam's unexplained symbol:' Avoid old beaches of Spain."If there had now been given its interpretation?
They threw Voyager, do not make the continent of truth, but to me this way and that among
the reefs and breakers of the dangerous coasts, many islands are mistaken for the most important,
and drifting in unknown seas, was at last headed straight for the old Catholic beaches, from which
the great explorers had sailed so many years earlier.

British India.
The year 1757 was one of the bleakest ever known in England. At home, the government was in a state of
complete confusion, although the country was at war with France, and France in alliance with
Austria, and these two nations have departed from its policy for
two centuries and a half, so that they can crush Frederic of Prussia,
England's allies.

Frederic was defeated in Kolin, the Austrians, on June 18, and a Russian army was in occupation
of East Prussia. A German army in the British pay for a night of 'Butcher' hero of Culloden,
was struck in July, and surrendered in September. In America, the pusillanimity of the English
masters led to terrible disasters, including the loss of Fort William Henry, and the massacre
of its garrison was eye-catching events. In India the English were engaged in a doubtful contest
with the viceroy of Bengal, which was supported by the French.

Although the fleet of England appeared at that time have lost their sense of superiority, not
only Admiral Byng had been shot at for not acting with the right spirit, but a combined expedition
against the French coast, which ended in error signal, and Admiral Holburne declined to attack
a French fleet outside Louisburg. Such a succession of disasters could well dissuade a people,
some of whom could remember the long list of victories that began with Blenheim and ended with
Malplaquet, and by the arrogance of the Grand Monarque had been punished.
But it is from this year by accident that the power of modern England must take their dates. In
the summer of 1757 formed the ministry managed to carry England's
power and glory to the heights that they did not succeed even under
the protectorate of Cromwell or rule Godolphin.

Then began the action ended with the expulsion of the French from North America and returned
to England in an area here that can perpetuate its institutions for ages after they shall
have ceased to be known in the mother country.

At that time, America conquered in Germany, and not only was Frederic so helpful to be able
to fight successfully against the three great houses of Bourbon, Habsburg, and Romanoff and
a horde of lesser dynasties, but the British armies, at Minden and Creveldt, renewed in the
field Continent of memories of a great island and the island of courage. Then it was a new spirit
breathed into the British marine, through which it has since been animated, and has rarely stopped
to count the odds.

Then began to rush the companies that made almost all of England who was assailable, from GorÃ©e
to Cuba and from Cuba to the Philippines.
 Peking
is in a state of decay. No effort or plans are being made to put a halt to the errosion. 
Origially,
there was a grandiose plan with a paved road.

For ten miles, all the way to Peking, no detail of the passage was overlooked. The finest materials
were used to construct the bridges & statues. An avenue of statues serves as an entrance to
the valley of tombs. The stone figures are spaced about 50 yards apart, and invoke men and
animals, on a humongus scale. Although the Chinese are not known for sculpture skills, and
the figures are more cartoonish than realistic, the sheer size and
determination of this project renders it worthy to be included as
one of the greatest wonders of man made Chineese civilization.

Indigestion: How to prevent it, How is it caused?
Eating too quickly is a well-known way to cause Dyspenia. So why does the American businessman
continue to contribute to an afternoon of discomfort and upset stomach? Many will say that they
understand well what causes the problem, yet the old saying, "time is money, money is time.",
leads them to sacrifice health for financial gain. But what about the hourly-wage clerk, or shop-girl?
The sad fact is that they seek to impress others with their style,
even though they know better.

Hunkering-down to a meat-pie, or hearty and healthy sandwitch, does not look as dainty and
does not promote the image of a sweet young thing, even-if they know that by consuming pie with
whipped-cream and a cherry on top will eventually result in the weak bones and missing teeth of the
crone. Promoting hale and hearty lunches by reminding women of their future roles as wives
and mothers, may be one way to discourage destructive lunch time choices, but the businessman
will only learn when he realises that an uncomfortable stomach is costing him time and money.
Many Americans would do well to observe the traditions of France when it comes to dining. The French
have refined their ways over centuries with an eye to avoiding this curse of modern civilisation.
 Additionally, the spectra of some
elements have been mapped out and drawn in much larger proportion. To date, many of these are
ready for publication, including a great number of lines in the map of the solar spectrum. Professor
Rowland's research allowed for the following table of solar elements to be roughly constructed:

Elements in the Sun, which were arranged based on their Intensity
and the Number of Lines in the Solar Spectrum. No darkness or shadow clouded their
view of the color, as it was or as it might be in the future. There was no uplifted finger of
cold decorum to scare them into a gray or sable doom.

Rather, they wrapped themselves inside rainbows and painted with the sunset.
 man is made of three basic entities
ie.soul,spirit and body. The corresponding senses to these entities are seeing,hearing and touching.Like
this art forms corresponding to this are music,painting and sculpture.Poetry is not the fourth
art.Instead it embraces and embodies all of these art in the form of rythm,description and
form. Hey you people who stand by
Darwin's theories of evolution, you need to leave, all of you. You're opinions have turned
Haeckel into a mindless fool.

After all, was it not he that stated in order for anyone to speak and be heard on evolution from
the primordial ooze, they must place their entire existence in the hands of science, renounce
all religious beliefs such as God, the Bible, the soul, and eternal life, and draw the clueless
conclusion that you have no idea where you came from. Once these are accomplished, then speak and be
heard. Mr. Haeckel is a smart man, one of which should be heeded. 

Lots of folks were disabused of the idea that they were invincible because, when Fear Not was
able to be murdered, there was no immunity from the Gentile missiles.
Till then, I'd really thought that the Prophet and the apostles had
spoken the truth. During
my last session I ventured to place on record, in this place, a prophecy by which I must abide,
let the effect of the unforeseen consequences on my sagacity be what it may. The ultimate results
of an experiment so similar, I cannot, in my own mind, have a moment's doubt of there ever
being one. 

Frequent daily drill languages, mathematics, and science, with compulsory attendance and frequent
formal examinations, is the discipline to which each student is submitted. This work is simple,
methodical, and comparatively inexpensive. One of my own
Republican correspondents had been telling to our editor that our present leader is not a good
type of leader. But he is a nasty one. Then he asked him about his personal view on his is
own statement.

He replied nothing personally about his own views and commonly said
that âhe has his own Godâ. By the reply I have become so surprised
about his distinctive tendency. Our first visit
was to a town, which really had the stuff to show and impress, a town that was situated in the
center of this land. There were straight streets that however ran in at some cross-angle. I
do admit that I was taken aback when I heard from my friends, so
many nice things about its wealth, trading strength etc of these parts
of the world; incidentally the place was my own birthplace, and I
knew and have also seen it that the men around there were all a mere
mass or horde of nasty, disagreeable slaves.

What does their trade mean to ours, or for that matter to that of Spain and France? As compared
to our fleets, where will their useless, rubbish of barks and so-considered boats and ports
stand? A single large war ship from our side would suffice to sink all their ware of the port; one line
of the French army would swamp all their horses and as for their ports the less said the better
since it will not stand a siege of even one month by us to rip them apart.  In three weeks
we were in their main town.

Once we had built a sizeable quantum of stock of tea, shawls, fans, raw silks, and such like
goods, we moved to the north. As we were aware that there was a lot of possibility of exposure
to harm, we took the precaution of taking a strong force with us
to work as guards, and to shield us from the wild herd that wandered
all round the region.

Some men in our group were Scots who had been here for trading, and
were very wealthy, and it was great pleasure for me to join them,
as they had been around here before also.

Five guides accompanied us and we pooled up our coins and put them all in one purse to buy food on
the way and to pay the men who were in charge of us.

A chief was chosen out of us to be at the command too in case we have a fight in our hands and
need to save our own lives and ofcourse when the moment came we saw there was absolutely no
need for the lead etc. On the sides of all the roads, there were men who were manufacturing
cups, pots, pens and other wares of that kind out of the type of
earth, that was available there and which veritably was the main trade
there.

The guide meanwhile said to me that he shall show me something which it may not be possible
to see any where else in the world (and this I could not contemptuously dismiss as I had done of all
other things of this place) and this was a house that was built of a kind of ware such as the cups
and plates were made of. I asked of him the size of the same as to whether it can get on to
my horse back.

The guide, surprised, said that there were not less than two scores of men living in there. He
later took us there and I saw it to be in fact a large house, constructed with lath and the best
ware that one can make out of earth. The sun was hot the rays striking the walls that were quite
white, hard and as smooth as glass with paintings on walls in blue shade. The walls of the rooms
were having small square tiles of the finest ware, in different colors
like red, blue, green paints of every shade and hues, in rare forms,
done in excellent aesthetic sense.

Since they used the same earth to make the joints between the tiles it was hardly possible to distinguish
the separation of tiles from one to the other. The floors were also of the same ware and they
were as strong as the ones at our homes back; the same was applicable to the roofs as well
except that the shades used were of a darker hue. Were there to be more time at my disposal
then I should have gladly gone around the house to see other things
like ponds for fishes, the walks, the yards, and courts which were
all made in the same manner.

I had taken more than two hours to see things around this fashion that kept me away from my
colleagues and I was penalized for the holdup of the group, with having to pay a fine to the chief.
In two days we had reached the Great Wall whose construction was made like a fortress in order
to give protection and ensure safety of the whole placeâand a wonderful
work at that.

For miles and miles it runs on a long track and the rocks have been kept so high and steep
that no intruder can dare climb it; or if at all they could manage then no wall could check
them. The Great Wall is also very thick, rather as thick as it is high, and in its path it is puzzling
with queer turns and winds. We now came across a horde of troops for the first time who moved
around from place to place to rob, loot, and kill any and everyone they came across. There
seemed no real way of doing things nor was there skill to be noticed in their moorings. Each had
a poor lean horse that had no great fitness to go about and work.

Our chief gave us the permission to move out and hunt as they say, and whatever we could lay
our hands on our hunting expedition if we may call it that was sheep only. The sheep were wild
and agile moving around fast; but they would not run far making it relatively easy for the hunter
to have it easy if you set up a chase.They move in flocks of a score, or two, and like true
sheep keep together when they fly.

 Imagine,
for a moment, that there has been an epoch of elevation: Vast mountain chains have climbed skyward,
volcanoes have spewed forth their lava, and fault-scarped cliffs run across the landscape.
Now, imagine that, for a brief period of time, the forces of elevation cease their growth.
The mountains will begin to get worn down little by little until
a peneplain, as W.M. Davis has termed it, is achieved.

This specific type of plain is similar in nature to that of a hyperbola approaching its asymptote.
 The
frog is cut open by a barber. He thinks it is very fat, and the victims come out of the frog.

There are many stories now in different parts of Europe, mainly in the south and east, which
talk about the relations existing between human beings and their destiny: each person having
their own special fate or fortune, and a guard demon who will be with him throughout his or he
success in life depends. Its not sure if all stories are from European, their leading ideas
seem to be of religious beliefs -- whether in classic times, teutonic,
slavic, or celtic times. 

Gilbert White was a fellow of Oriel College for more than fifty years, and some years since has
been offered to have a portrait of him painted for their hall. An inquiry was made of all the
member of his family; but no real portrait of any such description could be found. My grandfather,
Thomas White whom is Gilbert White's brother pressed him to have
his portrait painted.

According to my father, i have heard him talk about this and said that Gilbert White talked about
having his portrait painted but but it was never done.
 In one side, robbery, thiefs, slavery, tribute, civil disability;
on the other side, security, peace and honor. Nobody need to surprise that the constraint had
made people to succumbed before Islam, even the temporal inducement given for conversion had

Coming down from the time of Mohammed, there is a reign of the tolerant
and liberal-minded sovereign, Al mamun. But if it was made a lot
of direction to satisfy man's zeal and thirsty mind, and his aspirations for knowledge particularly
of physical matters as the main information, it is never laughed
at his runy efforts to deprive the great secrets of Infinitude allowing
only a mechanical device.

Although the spectroscope has presented probable resemblance of the terrestrial substance and to
the stellar, chemical-specific mixtures proceeded globes in space has not been found, and proved
to be the same as those observed in our own planet. In this regard Esoteric psychology can be
helpful. But who are the sceince men would agree to face it on their own work? Who of them
recognize the superiority and greater reliability Adept's knowledge of their own assumptions,
because in their case they may require the mathematical accuracy of the deducible reasonings
based on the supposed infallible precision of modern instruments,
Though Adepts claim, but the knowledge relating to the ultimate nature
of the matter they have been working long and the resulting phenomena
are produced .

How much can he insisted that the deductive argument is not only imperfect syllogistic form,
it may often be conflicted with the fact that their major proposals may not be correct always,
even if the predicates of their conclusions seem to correctly done - spectrum analysis would not
be recognized as inferior to the purely spiritual research. Similarly, before developing his sixth
sense, will the scientists acknowledges the error of his hypothesis of the sun's spectrum,
unless he resile, to some extent, at least in his major weakness
of probation and an alternative ending syllogisms eternal problems.

At the moment, "Adepts" can see no help for it. Were these invisible and unknown profanes
intervene - not to say openly conflict - such as to ensure the Royal Society, ridicule and
contempt, after which the charges abysmal ignorance of the preliminary basic modern science principles
would be their only reward, while those who lend ear to their "whims" would immediately characterize
them as types of "mild crazyiness" of the period. If not the size that August body, should begin
at once the great Mysteries, and without further ado, or preliminary,
and common preparations and training, the FRS's should be miraculously
with the necessary sixth sense, Adepts afraid that the task may be
useless.

The second one quite enough, though it may seem, for the first trial. Order of the martyrs great
universal truths were never broken, and a long list of unknown and as well as known sufferers,
the title is the name of Galileo, now closes as Zollner. Does the science world to know the real
reason for the premature death of Zollner? After the space's fourth dimension becomes a scientific
fact, as matter's fourth state, he might have a statue erected to him grateful furture generations.
But this does not remind him of life, and it covers many months of
mental pain and disruption of this intuitional soul, long-sighted,
modest genius, made also after his death to get a donkey kick to mislead
the public is accused of madness.

Until now, astronomy could fumble inbetween darkness and light with only uncertain guidance
accordingly. It has fallen and the mathematical precision of physical movement and the tracks
of heavenly bodies, and - not anymore.

It has not been able to find any approach to the security structure of the body so far, either
the sun, or stars, or even the cometary matter. Among the latter, it seems not known for more than
5000 years ago, was tought by the official astronomers belonging to old Chaldea and Egypt - to
say that it is foggy, because it conveys the rays from stars and planets without anykind of
obstruction.

 Maybe
(I admit that I hadn't thought of it before, but just maybe) he was already pulling together
the resources to make that trip to the capital. And maybe what he had made from his costly venture
was going to form the basis for his accumulation of trip money.

Then have I helped you get where you want to go, Auguste? Have I helped your upward climb, practically
a hillbilly when you started with that job driving a street-sweeper, going on to be a canny
pit boss at a sleazy billiard hall, and then a hustling cab driver with a constant sneaky way
of asking for tips in the form of "a little drinky-poo"? I can't bring myself to believe it,
because I can't stand the thought of him being other than what he
first seemed to be,--a childlike person who felt akin with Nature
and the honest-to-God truth.

As the day drug on, we realized we were getting close to a little town.
 In a civil court his chronicle and description of the
whiskers would be handled with derisive laughter.
Also, if we agree that Weichmann's narrative of the whiskers is true, and that is was not sufficient
to awaken vibes that something was wrong, he says that, around the same time, he proceede to
go to Surratt's room and discovered Payne playing with bowie knives,
and encircled with guns and spurs, while perched on the bed with Surratt.

It was witnessed by Miss Honora Fitzpatrick that Weichmann was regarded by Mrs. Surratt as
"more like a son than a friend." How horrible to treat someone that close to you in that manner!
An excellent reason for not letting Mrs. Surratt aware of everything, would be if be a person

 There wives accompanied them, leading
their mules with "full baskets, in the hope of taking away". ("Archives Nationales," F7, 3523. Letter
of the municipal body of Lunel, November 4, 1791.) With great struggle
it is that they could get rid of the peasants who were there to drive
the Catholic royalists out.

In vain "were they offered plenty of food and drink;" they go away, in meretricious humor, especially
the women that carried the booty leading the asses and mules, and who never expected heading
back home empty handed."

 The Balbi mansion in Genoa contains enough art to rival the splendour of the churches of
Rome. Even the Italians admit it to be so. I find it hard to believe. While devoted people revel
in the blessings bestowed upon them and their town, there are those
who lack the character and virtues as people of other provinces.

Genoa men lack honest, the women lack modesty. Genoa is a beautiful shell that lacks beautiful
inhabitants. Genoa contains an aboundance of wildlife, however, they require deep pockets to
obtain and are far from the best quality.

The aboundance of macaroni is a different story however, I have had more than my satisfying fill
of the stuff.
The narrow streets in Genoa are inconvenient and impractical.

The poor are everywhere. They encroach on your space, beg for mercy in the name of the Lord
and with practiced perfection, holds on for dear life while you are forced to look at their every
anguish and turmoil. Such pathetic misery, it is so disgusting to witness and be a part of
this gaudy city. The days are too long to deal with this. In Rome people beg for a free blessing,
not a handout.
One should not however speak unkindly of a population whose affection
for our country showed itself so clearly during the late war: a few
days residence with the English consult here at his country seat gave
me the opportunity to hear instances of the Republic's attachment
to Great Britain, whose victory in Gibraltar over the French and Spanish
were thouroghly enjoyed by the Genoese, who gave many proofs of their
sincerity, more solid than those clamorous ones of huzzaing our minister
about wherever he went, and crying Viva il General ELIOTT; while many
young gentlemen of high station volunteered to come aboard our fleet,
and were barely restrained.

We have been showed the most amazing villas belonging to the noble of this city, among which
Lomellino's was the most incredible.

The water there was so particularly beautiful, that he had generously left it at full liberty
to roll unconducted, and murmur through his tasteful pleasure grounds, much in the manner
of our lovely Leasowes. My eyes were so overwhelmed with square edged basons of marble, and
jets d'eaux, surrounded sculpture and statue aplenty, that I felt vast relief from Lomellino's
garden. Lomellino, like me, sick of the craft of the cities, prefers the simplicity of nature.

The mansion commands a view of the sea, the city, and the snow-topt mountains so much so that
it takes ones breath away.

Opposite the expansive view groves of cedar, ilex, and orange trees, naturally placed and left
unkept and raw, tantalize the senses and rise into height truly respectable.
 "She had no name yet, and i'm considering to named her after you, just for luck, you
know, since you are my first fare."
Innocently she asked, "Is that considered lucky? because if it is, then of course you may. My
name is Rosamond, but it is rather long for a boat, don't you think? Just call her the Rose,
my father and some other people often called me that than rosamond."
Thoughtfully he answered, "I think Rosamond is not too long, but of
course i shall named her as you wish." 

"That is the reality, Jerry. But nobody would admit it." "Do you think that people really talk
the way Mr. Micawber talks? I haven't heard anyone like him, and certainly nobody talks like his
wife either." I commented. "I agree, but there must be people who are like them somewhere.
I think Mr. Dickens way of talking is the proper one." she answered. It was the best criticism
of the literary giant. She openly showed her affection for me, we understood each other completely
and shared the same tastes. with roger, she was quiet. but with me, she talked nonstop. I could
give her opinion on a lot of things that he knew nothing of.

 A copy sold at a Belfast auction(recorded
by Willems)proves that copies could very possible still exist in this country. Every now and
then a copy appears in the salesrooms of London, and at Brighton another copy was found. Little imaginative
effort is required to see merchants and those who travel, who happened to make their way through
the Low Countries during that time, putting copies into their pockets
to use in household across the waters.

Many of those who were exiled during the Protectorate , looking throughout the bookstores in
Amsteredam, must have happened upon a copy as a present to a daughter or wife.
Numbers as well,must have made their way to France.

Some time back our book-hunter stayed at an old hostel in Rouen. The outside appearance of the building
was completely antique. It was located one of the back narrow allies that led towards the Place
Henri Quatre: the courtyard was not large enough to sufficiently turn a baker's cart around.
Like several other homes in this aging town, the crookedness of the house made seem impossible
to stand. As he went up the rickety staircase he had misgivings. The bedroom that was to be his
was neat as a pin, and well furnished, and this eased his misgivings. He would be able to read
and write as much as wanted without any disturbance for the length of his stay. He was sure that
wonderful surprises would be in store for one surrounded by such grandeur!
A surprise came to him soon.
A slim hostess asked, "Will Monsieur like to be cooked for tonight?"
Being late as it was our bookman did not want to go out. He was also anxious to do a little exploring
around his room before dark.

If the hostess could prepare an omlette correctly, that would be
delectible. I was never called silly
or forced to leave, though I should have, like ATKINSON. I know poetry and who I am.

Terrorism is extreme in the House. ATKINSON received a harsh blow. MORTON, and no one else,
endlessly talks about all the awful things that are yet to come. ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS is hardly at
peace with the state of things as ATKINSON took the spotlight for himself. The Committee on
Irish Votes passed a ridiculous charge to be paid by the Dublin Police: an excessive sum of
Â£1000. Perhaps, the Irish Members would look after that for themselves.

The din lasted for ten minutes, then ALPHEUS finally sat down.

This was the perfect opportunity for the Prince of Naples to see the true colors had he chosen
this time to visit. Instead, he sat in the Gallery just after Questions, and had the joy of
joining an group of 19 (SPEAKER included) while CLARK'S ramblings about Scotch Crofters. Business
done. --Committee of Supply.

Then it was Wednesday and many House members deserted.

AKERS-DOUGLAS worked hard to keep the men there, but they were dropping like flies. It was
a long Session, everyone was worn out. Still, we knew it was our duty to QUEEN and country to
stay until we finished.

SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE departed not knowing how we'd make it without
his presence.

He started a speech about how some are more valuable to the country than others. They needed
special care, no matter the violence that is committed against private
feelings.

He continued that he was sent off to Marienbad, but preferred to
remain.

However, the "supreme commander" has sent him and he must go. However, he will return, he assured
us. We were commanded to watch out for Mr. G. because he's prone to overworking himself to the
point of endangering his health. "Our health," the Sage said, "is precious to all of us," more
especially to some of his colleagues on the Front Bench. What will he do when he at last retires?
There are many old ladies of a political mind who find themselves on the funeral pyre. There's
___, and ____, and ___ ____." Those words are not meant to be said, especially by me. Should
you want them, feel free to ask the SAGE, Poste Resetante Marienbad. "They could not think of lingering
on the political scene after the retirement of the head of the family. I shall certainly attend
the Suttee. It will be an interesting and ennobling spectacle.

It will, moreover, make some room on the newly constructed Treasury Bench."

He finished. SAGE has left by Club train. The representatives of AKERS-DOUGLAS are seen in the
distance and were given a mission to determine if he left or disappeared
elsewhere.

It's Saturday and I'm house sitting. I'm in survival mode.
The Members, are drifting off. Affairs couldn't be any lower, though
business is just about wrapped up. The House lingers a week longer
in hopes to complete all the stages of the Appropriation Bill in hopes
that the Constitution will not be defunct.

The prospect was dull
and deadly as I discovered WADDY, Q.C., legs crossed and resting above
his brow in a sort of a salute, was his pointer-finger with a reputation
of its own for shaking at juries as he lectured. Perhaps he has a
headache, I inquired as it seemed most likely.

"No, I've got an idea."

interested in orders that have not been informed and forwarded. With in millions of year "Conquer them first" has
been a famous and noble, glorious war-cry on earth.

As we are driving a nail witch is well possible to eventually Clench it, when we all truly know
the way, witch this union nail may be clenched. there will be much hope and spirit will rise
interested in forwarding the war.
If all the millions of South remain united till death in the cause
of Secession.

With nothing else but just a little bit guerilla warfare, to start hope. The number of people
that are excited and have a senses of togetherness at the present prevailing In Eastern Virginia
and others controlled by the active secessionists. Have brought terror
to the hearts and eyes to many. 

Chubb was a member of a school that rejected the idea that they were "enemies" of Christianity.
We can see this from two of his works, 'The True Gospel of Jesus Christ asserted' and 'The True
Gospel of Jesus Christ vindicated,' which explain his views especially well. Chubb, like Tindal,
compares the degree of certainty in any traditional belief system
with that of natural religion.

His work also reflects Tindal's challenge to what some considered an insufficiency in revelation
in regard to its applicability anywhere and to anyone. He writes, 'Our Lord Jesus Christ undertook
to be a reformer, and in consequence thereof a Saviour.

The true Gospel is this: (1) Christ requires a conformity of mind and life to that eternal
and unalterable rule of action which is founded in the reason of things, and makes that the only
ground of divine acceptable, and the only and sure way to life eternal. (2) If by violation of
the law they have displeased God, he requires repentance and reformation
as the only and sure ground of forgiveness.

(3) There will be a judgment according to works. This Gospel wrought a change which by a figure
of speech is called "a new birth"' (Â§ 13). According to him, 'the Christian revelation was
expedient because of the general corruption; but it was no more than a publication of the
original law of nature, and tortured and made to speak different things.'[158] Chubb mostly criticizes
not the Old Testament, but the New Testament, which he does not accept
as literal or absolutely correct.

Chubb wants to emphasize not theoretical or hypothetical problems in religion, but instead those
problems that would seem commonsense to literate, but poor, people. He has an almost workmanly
attitude toward the Bible, a tendency to take it at face value. Chubb seems to be telling other
members of his class to ignore speculation, suggesting that they are peripheral problems. Like
Deisticals, he discusses the shortcomings of clerics as a group, as a class the wealth and
status of which offended and troubled workers.

This included members of the lower and lower-middle classes, who were most suspicious of the clerisy.
Chubb is angry about the 'unnatural coalition of Church and State,' [159] which benefits some
people so much that they live like kings. Chubb wrote well and in such a way as to arouse his
audience, even though he often made scholarly errors.

At this time, Deism changed significantly as a movement and as a school of thought. This had
a great deal to do with the book 'Christianity not founded on argument,'
a 1742 book by Dodwell that confused people as to whether it was for
the religion or against it.

This was unclear because Dodwell, who was called 'the younger,' believed, like most people at the
time, that revelation and reason were harmonious -- the question was which was primary. Both sides,
Orthodox and Deist, accused each other of sacrificing one for the other. In this case, Dodwell rejected
both of their views and their attacks on each other -- he sought
to reconcile them.

Indeed, Dodwell, writing his book as though writing a very lengthy letter to a young friend
studying at Oxford, rejects the very notion of rational faith, calling it 'a contradiction in terms.'
 In his account of a great fight
he had with the Kayans, Lingire described how he was able to kill
ninety-one men and caused their army to retire defeated.

When asked whether the Kayans had used sumpitan, he said yes but
went on the relate how many of his men did not die from the wounds,
since they knew how to cure them.

His testimony adds to the body of evidence which confirms Mr. Crawfurd's
theory that this poison is not as potent to destroy life if the arrow
is instantaneously removed from the wound, as is usually the case.

Lingire then described the arrival of 26th.--Linn, a Sakarran chief who came to avow their surrender
and thier hope for peace.
 

It was surely exhibited under circumstances which warrant us in saying, that âeven his failings
leaned to virtueâs side,â taking for granted that Sir William Follett had a tendency towards
the former failing.
There is another which cannot be overlooked, connected with and immediately
dependent upon this accusation upon the late Sir William Follett.

Making use of his remarkable popularity and reputation, he received fees from clients for
services which he very well was aware that he would not possibly able to do. He did this discreditably
and unconscientiously, and therefore he is charged with having made a profit of his prodigious
popularity and reputation, in a nutshell with taking briefs in cases
in which he had no practical hope of being able to attend, which is
a very serious allegation, and a persistent and honest examination
is required.

 "Look, man," he exclaimed, "the bird of Ra has killed the thief
wandering waters. And so you have to punish the saboteurs of the sea."
Then he took counsel with the captains, and some trusted men were
sent to the camp of the barbarians.

And they were accused of giving a bad report of the army of Pharaoh, and say that it is kept waiting
for the great start away from the hill across the step.
Then the Wanderer summoned the captains of the archers, and ordered them to hide all his strength
among the rocks and thorns on both sides of the mountain pass, and wait until he called the
hosts of the enemy at the pass. And with the archers, sent a part of the Lancers, but the cars crept
into the shelter of the hill on this side of the card.
Now, when the ambush was set, and all were gone save the horse only,
their spies came and said that the army of the barbarians marched
from their camp, but the Achaeans marched, but stopped beside the
river protect the camps and ships.

Then the Wanderer ordered the horse ride over and stand in the plain, and not wait for the
enemy. But when the hosts of the barbarians commanded, must reel before loading, and finally
flying upside down, as if the passage in fear. And he himself would lead the flight in your
car, and where there should be further addressed.
So the riders rode through the passage and formed their armies on the plain. Now the enemy was
approaching, and a glorious sight it was to see the sparkling midday sun in their innumerable
spears.

Of riders did not have great numbers, but there were many cars and swordsmen, spearmen and,
beyond counting and slingers. Reached by the nations, and the host of each nation the king sat in
the nation in a glorious chariot, with girls and eunuchs, fans holding
fan with him and silk canopies to hide the sun .

Now the Wanderer hung behind squads of horsemen, as if in fear. But today, he sent messengers
bidding the captains of the squadrons to charge the first nation and fight for a while, but
weakly, and then, when they saw him turn his horse and galloped across the way, to follow after
him as if in doubt, but in such a way as to draw the enemy on his
heels.

The mercenary captains did. Once loaded and were rejected, then returned to the charge, but the
men made as if they feared the start. Now the enemy came hard after them, and the Wanderer returned
to his car and fled through the pass, gradually followed by the horsemen.
And when the hosts of the barbarians were in turn created a mighty
shout of laughter that rent the heavens, and charged after them. 

Devotees of the racetrack relish their independence and freedom from convention, to the point
that they are often incapable of concealing this. Perhaps this is related to the unpredictable nature
of their finances. It shows in everything from a cocky walk to flouting the "No Smoking" signs.
Expect no formal or subservient posture: the hands will be in the pockets of a suit more appropriate
to an every-day vacation than an everyday vocation.

If you look for him, there he will be, placing his wager at the window. But this represents merely
the end result of his study, since the bulk of his time is spent researching any and all aspects
of the environment in which he thrives or perishes. Names (of horses
as well as jockeys) and numbers such as current stakes and statistics,
are of infinite value in his store of knowledge. 

Will we allow the descending pupils to remain in ignorance on these subjects: why the second
city of New England was Providence; why for the rush for prosperity she deserted Newport in
such a bad way; why Cincinnati and Buffalo were set up, all the while North Bend and Black
Rock died down; why the biggest manufacturing city in North America became Chicago; why the
town meeting was kept by New England, and the county and townships
were preferred by the West; and why several upon several other things
happened.

For sure we have had Hildreth, Sparks, and Bancroft, but these people heve let us in on little
of the historical facts of the people as Hallam, Hume, Lingard, as well as the others told England.
 From the
studio system, no less than by the peculiar social character, if they can express what has
always prevailed in the Lyceum of Tsarskoe Selo, we deduce the cause of the peculiar intensity
and duration of his friends entered into Breast - a fact that continues
to distinguish it from a higher degree can be predicated of any other
institution with which we are familiar, and we refer to this more
time from the conviction, it would be absolutely impossible to form
a true idea Pushkin - not just as a man, but even as a poet - we would
leave out of our picture of the immense influence it has on the whole
of his career, both in the world of reality and art in the regions,
by close and intimate friendship that was formed at the Lyceum, in
particular Delvig.

Few parts of the biography poetry contains a pure interest or touch more than the chapter
describing the friends of the college or school of great men, and allusions to many colleagues
Liceo Liceo and happiness, so profusely scattered throughout the pages Pushkin, has an indescribable
charm the imagination, and no less delicious than the recital of
Byron's almost feminine affection for "Harness bit" or the often recalled
the image of meditation Childe juvenile Noble in the shadow of elm-cemetery
Harrow.

During the six years he spent at the Lyceum Pushkin (1811-1817), the intellect and the affections
of the young poet was fast and constantly developing.
He could not, indeed, be regarded as a diligent student of those who look at the progress made
by him in regular occupations and ostensible of the institution;
but it is undeniable that the activity of its powerful and precise
and penetrating mind are strong and steady employment in a wide circle
of general reading.

His own version of the acquisitions he had made in this period, and the various branches of study
that had cultivated assiduously, more or less shows that, however disjointed it may have been
the nature of reading, and yet unformed or inconsistent his literary projects, which possessed
a sufficient extent, even in this period, major elements of Fame in the future, namely. the
habit of vigorous industry, and held the power of abstraction and
contemplation.

His personal appearance at this time, was a clear indication of his character, intellectual and
moral. The close-curly hair, wire, mobile and irregular features, dark complexion, betrayed his
descendants; and served as was appropriate for a character that was formed at the beginning of all
individuality, and remained unchanged in its main features throughout
the short existence of the poet.

Time of the Lyceum Youth traditions to remember the general lines of Pushkin character; long
will the fair trial of adolescence do justice to manhood, honor, simplicity of nature, the great
poet, and hand down a younger generations, many traits that exemplify
the passionate warmth of his heart, the joy of his character, and
the immensity of his memory.

In all cases where the circumstances are quite under his observation, young people are the best
judges of a domestic nature and more foolproof physiognomists external
features of the face.

Pushkin was extremely popular among their peers - the generosity of his character had peculiar
charm to the unsophisticated minds of young people, and the force of a weakened body not in
infancy by the indulgence of luxury, makes it possible to obtain,
by exchange their sport, regardless least among them that are derived
from the work of his insight and sarcastic humor.

 Men looked at complicated civilization
and saw an enclosed village,doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen diminished and the democratic
stereotype was universally applied.
Citizen was public-spirited enough in the township, where he knew
everybody and was interested in everybody and was consistently public-spirited
and endowed with unflagging public interest individuals qualified
to deal with all common affairs.

The idea of enough for a locality converted to the idea of enough for any purpose. Quantitative
thinking does not suit a stereotype. Since everybody assumed to be interested in important
affairs only, those affairs only became more significant and others were neglected, was another
turn to the circle.

Unchallenged pictures in their heads formed their picture of the world outside. These stereotyped
images came from their parents and teachers. Their own experience were little corrected. Even fewer
had reason to go abroad. Most voters lived their almost whole lives in one environment, and surroundings
with small variations.

Political speeches, their religious training, and rumors etc filled their time. They had to conceive
that larger environment of commerce and finance, of war and peace. Only a few men had affairs
that took them across state lines. The number of public opinions based on casual fancy. Any
objective report was in proportion to what those based on and was very small.
Self-sufficiency was a spiritual ideal in the formative period for
varying reasons.

The physical isolation of the township, the loneliness of the pioneer, the theory of democracy, the religious
tradition, and the limitations of political science all converged
to make men believe that to entangle various difficulties political
wisdom is required.

It is not strange that to hold on the deduction of laws from absolute principles, much of their
free energy was utilized. The American political mind live on its capitalism theory. In legalism
it found a tested body of rules make new rules. This can be made without any relevance to experience.The
formulae became so curiously sacred , foreign observers had been amazed at the contrast between
the dynamic energy of the American people and the static theorism of their public life . The
steadfast love of fixed principles was the only way known of achieving
self-sufficiency.

But it meant that the public opinions of any one community about the outer world consisted chiefly
of a few stereotyped images. Animated by the feeling aroused by local experiences they are arranged
in a pattern of their legal and moral codes.
Base of democratic theory is from its fine vision of ultimate human dignity. Lack of of knowledge
for reporting draw back of environment of wisdom.

Experience happened to have accumulated in the voter. God had, in the words of Jefferson, made men's
breasts "His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue." These chosen people in
their self-contained environment had all the facts before them.

COMMITTEE of one hundred 45 
Faneuil HALL
MEETING for public parks.

In accordance with a call published in all daily newspapers, and signed by many prominent citizens
and taxpayers of Boston, was a public meeting convened in Faneuil Hall on the evening of Wednesday,
07.06.1876 to take action on recommendations contained in the report
of Park Commissioners.

Hall was crowded for intelligent and enthusiastic audiences and procedures, as reported verbatim
in the columns of Journal Boston Morning "were as follows: -
The meeting was called to order at eight o'clock by Mr. John W. Candler, who said -
Gentlemen, - As chairman of the Committee of arrangements, I was invited to convene this meeting
to order. This is usually the case that when a mass meeting of citizens to be held, much labor
must be performed to prepare and organize the meeting. But I am glad to say that on this occasion,
important advantage of having an audience almost entirely in our
favor was enjoyed by the committee.

We found a strong and smart and deep almost unanimous feeling throughout the community, with the city
government for taking prompt and favorable action on the report of park commissioners. Applause
[.] Found serious and enthusiastic community, seeking as a system of parks should be designed to
Boston to ensure health, and make some positive and prosperity of our citizens in the future.
Committee had only to call this press address through which some of you have read, to find him
one hundred ready to Indore, and authorities had only to open doors to get Faneuil Hall crowd
here, as they have to night, to express feelings that they feel so
general. 

Dr.Gustavus Brown migrated to maryland in 1708 and in 1710 who was the grandfather of Dr.Brown's
married Fraces, the daughter of Colonel Gerard Fawke.

Their son,Richard Brown, returned to England to prepare himself for the Church. William, who
is Richard's son, was born in Scotland in 1748 and was educated at the University of Edinburgh,
got graduated in 1770 and went to America. This is Alexandria's Dr.Brown.
At the age of twenty-two, this young Scotsman, born gentle, learned, traveled, handsome, came
to Vigirina. 

I met with Simmons and we both looked at each other and felt very guilty and ashamed too. He
gave me a brown loaf and delicious coffee but i exhausted the loaf and the cofee is on the way.

with joy that these lines show.
forty seven - forty eight. PATIENTLY GAVE UP THEIR QUIET BEEING. See
the life of the dead nature. Wordsworth had said so many times that
there was a mind in nature. So completely is mind of Her Majesty's Ministers busied with this Fog
complication, that to-night it got into House of Commons. LORD ADVOCATE carried within Bill allocating
Scotch Local Taxation grant. Debate went onto for six hours; at end of that moment heard that
complete proceedings irregular.

As embroiling finance question, introduction of Bill should possess been preceded via Resolution
presented towards Committee of complete House. Debate abruptly adjourned;
evening wasted; howls of derision from Radicals. Weingarten spoke
to Rosa of the fiendish whispers that misled his soul and the whispers of gold rewards of fortune
and of eternal gratitude that the tempters whispered of thus making him sell his honour and
becoming a traitor.This was all done in quest for the gold thus becoming what he is now. 
Rosa
asks him of the danger that threatens him to which he hoardely saya
that pucishment for being a traitor.He then asks Rosa for the wine
so that he can gain strength to go to the king.

On being questioned by Rosa as to why at this early hour, he asks her if he has not been with
the king often at this hour when he would convey important news or
despatched to the king.Rosa leaves the room only to return immediately
with the bottle of wine he asks her for and thus fills a glass.

He rose his toast to the king and rejoices taking a deep breath feeling his blood feeling freely
through the veins. Brushing his hair in front of a glass and planting as kiss on Rosa's pale
shaking lips, he left the room, walking hurriedly through the empty halls and chambers without
being stopped as there were none.

Deesen was seated in the king's antechamber having breakfast.On being asked by Weingarten on
whereabouts of the king, he replies that the king is up like the sun in the sky.
Weingarten then expresses his wish to meet the king with some important news to be conveyed.Deesen
returns from the king's chamber after coveying the message and allows
him in.

Weingarten ushers in to find the king seated in an arm chair with windows opened to let in fresh
summer air.Amalthea, the king's white greyhound lay at his feet with soft black eyes.
 In fact, candor is the basis of our right influence
on the natives, and as I wanted to make Pangeran Usop my friend,
I went to work candidly, and immediately told him all that I told
Sultan to.

The value of my conversations are as follows: The first topic is the anticipated visit of the
English, 'is the English coming? " 'Was Mr. Bonham coming? " is the first question, and 'To
what purpose? " I replied, that English is definitely coming, but no bad intentions, it is true that
they are offended by the captain, and abuse people Sultana met, yet
I have endeavored to put it in the best light, and had urged that
a friendly communication for the future is better than a memory that
may give rise to unpleasant feelings: I am sure that the English would
be a friendly intercourse, and I hoped, I can not even say, they will
look to the future, and not the past.

I had, I added, without power, but my friendship for the Sultan forcing me to let him know what
I had heard in other countries. When Mr. Bonham came, she could tell them all, but I can say now that
I thought he would demand an agreement between Singapore and Borneo
for the mutual protection of trade, and the protection of people every
country shipwrecked or otherwise sought protection in either place.

"On the whole, it is certainly the feeling of Borneo are very friendly, consistent and certain
people of influence will receive us in their warmest way, and give us every thing, if we only
resort measures of reconciliation. It can never be too often repeated, that reconciliation
is the only policy Malays, and especially Borneons, with very vague and confused idea of our power.
A harsh fact, a final demand, they heard in their lives, and they did not hear it the first time
and remain friendly, for all who have any acquaintance with the native
character to know their keen awareness false shame.

To demand, therefore, the trees here to recognize our superiority is, I am sure, be met with
an arrogant refusal. In some years, if we proceed quietly to establish a beneficial influence,
it will fall on our vision without reserve, for, as I often have stated before, their government
is the last stage of destruction and decay.
"The reconciliation of Muda Hassim was soon after, and as Kleeses of Lord Melbourne, 20 in
number, they are simultaneously surrendered to me, with a request
that I want to forward them to Singapore as soon as I could .

BLACK IN CUSTODY  
Charles Thomas, very black, has white teeth,
is about 5 feet 10 inches tall and about 26 or 27 years old, has had
his left leg was broken, which is folded into a little above the ankle,
spoke French and English and is a great rogue. Sam was an elegant man, who moved in circles rather above
his own standing. He first encountered Mr. Ringwood at the Baron's house, and they went to a play
together. Mr. Ringwood joked that Sam was well off in a certain quarter. Sam had also played billiards
with the Baron at the Estaminy. The Estaminy was a very upscale place, which allowed smoking,
said Sam. It was common for the upper nobility to spend time there. Sam and Mr. Ringwood were very close,
and planned to have dinner that day at Mr. Ringwood's, and eat the next night with the Baroness.

Sam expected the neighbours to stare when they heard how well he had been doing. And this was a
reasonable assumption, because certainly very few businessmen have had the same opportunities as Mr.
Pogson.
We agreed to go out shopping together the next morning, to buy some
gifts, that Sam wanted to give to his relatives upon his return.

He planned to get a French cashmere shawl and bonnet for his aunt, seven needle-books for his
sisters, a gilt buckle for his mother, and a toothpick case for his father. Sam is very good
to his family, and adores his aunt, who is very well-off and has no heirs. When I went to meet
Sam for the shopping trip, I found him laying on a sofa, looking
quite ill.  
I understood immediately, and asked him if he had drunk
too much claret.

He only stared at me in return. I asked him where the Honorable Tom lives.
Sam laughed hollowly, and said that Tom is in fact far from honorable. I asked if he was an
imposter. Sam answered, "No, he is a real Honorable, but...".

I asked if he was jealous of Tom.
He replied that he was not jealous at all, but that Tom was a thief, and his wife as well. They
won 38 pounds from him before supper, and gave him so much claret
that he became drunk, and sent him home.

He couldn't afford to lose 40 pounds.

It had taken him two years to save up that amount. He feared that if his aunt were to hear
of his loss, she would disinherit him. He was extremely upset and pulled at his hair.
While he was going on about his troubles, the bell rang. He called out that the caller may enter,
and a tall elegant man wearaing a fur coat came in through the door. 

It is never easy to get permission to see old tombs. Even lawsuits may not secure such permission.
A case in point is the lawsuit to regain the chancel that belonged to the parish of Arundel.
The lawsuit failed. The Chapel was founded by Earl Richard Fritz-Alan in 1380 for the College
of Holy Trinity.

There are many tombs of earls and countesses who lived in the 15th and 16th centuries. The effigies
on the tombs are good illustrations of the style of dresses worn by aristocracy in these centuries.
The brass tablets on these tombs are also very interesting.
This beautiful parish church that was at one time part of the Monastery of Seez in Normandy has
an antique canopied pulpit.

The choir sits under the tower. Frescos of the Seven Deadly sins and Seven Works of Mercy adorn
the northern wall. The church is separated from the chancel by a screen wall made of iron grill
and plain bricks.
Arundel has also the remnants of Maison Dieu, built by Earl Richard, who also built the church. In
those days the house accommodated twenty persons. The piers of Arun bridge were built from the
ruins of this house.
Visitors are permitted to view the church of St. Philip Neri between
the services.

This is a very modern Roman Catholic Church, built in the decorative Gothic style at a cost of
more than a hundred thousand pounds. One can see the statutes of the Twelve Apostles before
entering the church. These are located in the west side under the beautiful âroseâ window.
Inside the church, the clustered columns are awesome and the apse is magnificent. The âStations
of the Crossâ are bas-reliefs on the wall.

The glow from the pale tints of the lovely stained glass windows fills the viewer a sense of reverence.

A visitor who wanders around in Arundel will find the park interesting. If you take the road
that passes under the castle, and walk on though a small gate near the mill, you will be rewarded
by the beautiful sight of the Swanbourne Lake. The mill itself is worth the walk. It is located
at the top of the stream flowing out of the lake. There are islands in the lake which have willows
and ash trees. The valley, the lake with its tree-covered islands, and the castle in the distance,
offer a view that cannot be easily forgotten. This is the most beautiful
spot in Arundel.

If you continue going around the lake and go up the Horn Tower you will have a breath taking
view of the Arun Valley and the Downs. 
All this natural beauty
is maintained in all its grandeur. People are permitted to picnic
in this scenic area but you will not find any rubbish left by them.
This is because the cleaning crew, which arrives early in the morning,
does an excellent job. He stated, "My complaint is as if a girth were buckled
tight over my chest, and my endeavor in the night is to get it loose." Following the battle of Cape
St. Vincent, he felt that rest was necessary if he were going to
recover.

He stated that he would not serve past the coming summer, unless it was completely essential.
The punishment for his strong language was four years and nine months without any rest - mentally
or physically.
 On the other hand, Warburton had an honest warning that acknowledgement was not
to be made for this part of his help; and if his synopsis were to
be followed, as it had seemed would be likely, his condemnation of
the Preface as "Theobald's heap of disjointed stuff" was disingenuous,
to say the least.

Far less defensible was his assertion in the same latter to Thomas Birch that, besides from
the section of Greek texts, the entire Preface was virtually stitched together from notes
which he had supplied (Nichols, Illustrations, II, 81).

Three other points concerning the Preface demand mention. First, the part on Shakespeare's
life was often missed as a recension of Rowe's Life (1709). However, the expansion itself
was a characteristic example of one of Theobald's habits. His habit of exploring original sources.
 

As a matter of fact it was considered as one of the most kind and thoughtful tendencies for
these colonists all the same.
When we were reached Wynberg on 16th December, the situation was mingled with quite dark. A row
of ambulance wagons were readily standing beyond the platform for emergency purpose and also
in front of such ambulance, a line of Saint.

Johnâs ambulance men were waiting readily. They had been all come from England and they resembled
very fresh, neat and well groomed. Conveniently all such injured and wounded people were speedily
suggested to the waggons and safely lodged in the hospital for further management. But, unfortunately,
when they were lifting a poor fellow from out of the train to the ambulance, he was died unexpectedly.
Due to these kinds of busy and sincere duties, I was not sleeping and taking rest even for more
than six hours with my colleagues in three consecutive nights. After we had transferred the
entire patient from train to hospital only, we became free from our
bounded duties.

Next morning when we were doing our duty till twelve oâclock, we were on rest for a few
hoursâ and allowed to leave. During our leisure hours, we were taking a warm bath and a lunch
at the Royal Hotel with a good bottle of wine happily and peacefully and it was very welcome.
Also we were all in excellent excited spirits when the whistle sounded for our journey and
we steamed away once more to the north with 600 miles before us.  During our journey, we
halted again at De Aar, where we stayed there together till Christmas.

The weather was so hotter and hotter to enjoy. We were in force to feel all kinds of natural
disorders like the whirling dust, the stony plains, the glaring heat, the evening coolness,
the glowing sunsets, the bare rocky hills in the Sudan.

Then after our train loaded with stores and guns and ammunition for the front, the whole of
this enormous traffic again successfully started to run on a single line of rails. Amongst the most
troublesome items to deal with were the mules. Sometimes a mule would suddenly produce a violent
chaos in a wagon. This is was our chaos experience as hoof against every mule and every mule's
hoof against him. The
steam engine led to the demand for coal as fuel. Man has searched and exploited underground
resources for his needs.
In Eighteen Hundred Nineteen, Savannah, the first steamship, made
her maiden voyage across the ocean. This marked the beginning of using
coal as a fuel. In regards to rheumatism, there are
no more than one in fifty joints that are left permanently damaged by rheumatism. One bout
of rheumatic fever will leave the person as well as the person's joint more susceptible to other
attacks. "Once rheumatic, always rheumatic" was the slogan of the
British during the war of 1812. 

Unless someone was in trouble, anyone could enjoy the trip we took on the water. We were definitely
glad to be safe and getting closer to home, but it was hard to relax and have a good time just because
we were thinking so much. We hopped on a train in Owen Sound and took it all the way to Parkdale
which is right outside of Toronto. After a while, I decided to go
home and took off at 9pm. Whomever he is able to pierce with all his arrows, he should have them muted, still,
quiet, lying immobile, lither and full of ease. When Theophrastus was asked, in conformation, what
kind of beast or thing he thought a playful, unjustifiable love to
be?

He replied, that is was a passion of inactive and lethargic spirits. [224] When he defined lechery,
from which pretty description of tickling-tricks, that of Diogenes, the Cynic, was not very inconsistent.
Of all other occupation, the occupation of folk was insolvent.
 So every night he spent hour upon hour,
tediously searching for anything he could find. He finally convinced Mr. Venus, a lonely man
disappointed by several failed relationships, who made an odd living stringing skeletons together
on wires, to become his partner in the search.

One day Wegg found something. Inside an empty pump was a parchment, and he soon realized that
it was a second will of old Harmon's, written later than the first, but this one leaving the entire
fortune, not to the son at all, but to the Crown.

When Wegg read it, his two-faced soul nearly burst inside him, for he knew that before Mr.
Boffin ever relinquished his fortune to the Crown, he would pay him anything he asked to destroy
this new will. He was such a scoundrel himself that he never thought that Mr. Boffin might actually
be honest and do the right thing.

He assumed that everyone thought the way he did, yet all the while he was convinced that he was
decent and upright in all he did, as hypocrites usually do.
The only thing Wegg couldnât decide on was how much to hit his benefactor up for. He wrestled
with it, initially thinking he would ask for half, but the more he relished his secret knowledge
of the will, half didnât seem near enough. Before long, his greed got the best of him, and
he was convinced that the will was worth the entire fortune, minus
a tiny share for Mr. Boffin, and he would accept nothing less.

Now, Mr. Venus, Weggâs partner in crime, had been promised monetary compensation by Wegg for his
help, but his already tortured conscience was gnawing at him.

After all, Mr. Venus was an honest man at heart, and so he eventually told Mr. Boffin about the
finding of this second will.

The Golden Dustman thought Mr. Venus was being devious at first, so he pretended to be terrified
of Wegg and this new found will. However, crafty old Mr. Boffin was not at all concerned about this
new will, because he knew something that neither Wegg nor Venus, nor even John Rokesmith,
the secretary, knew. He knew that the old, original dustman, Harmon,
had made yet another will, even later than the first two. The first
will required the son to return to England to marry Bella. The second
will, found by Wegg in the pump, apparently left all his fortune to
the Crown. But, the third and final will gave all the money to Mr.
Boffin, regardless of whom the son married, giving none of it to anyone
else.

It is our pleasure to promote to our readers, uplifting articles about
dancing.

A newly published novel describes A Dance in Hoops like this: 
It
started as a regular dance, but soon broke into a synchronized group
wandering fluidly as if in a maze, and exchanging partners in such
a manner as to awe the senses.

The only other dance of this caliber and magnitude, odd as it may be, is the dancing horses
in Mr. Peakes's satirical comedy Quadrupeds.
The ever changing music brought us a delightful rendition which was
quite enjoyable.

 He was present at the annihilation of the Archbishop and wrote
his life, to which this annual is an introduction.

He says, first of all, that the town independent thirteen beyond conventual churches and a hundred
and twenty-six archdiocese churches.

He writes alone fifty years afterwards the Abundant Fire, so that it is not acceptable that
fresh parishes had been erected. All the churches which had been destroyed were rebuilt. Best of
them were actual small parishes, with, doubtless, actual small churches. We shall acknowledgment
anon to the catechism of the churches.

On the east was the White Tower which he calls the 'Palatine Castle:' on the west there were
two towers--there was the Tower alleged Montfichet, breadth is now
Blackfriars station, and Baynard's Castle, abutting beside it.

The walls of the Burghal had seven bifold gates. The river bank had by this time been taken
down. Two afar from the City, on the west, was the Royal Palace (Westminster), adherent with
ramparts and affiliated with the city by a crawling suburb. Already, therefore, the Strand
and Charing Cross were settled.

The gates were Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate, Ludgate, and the Bridge.

FitzStephen
says that the citizens were so able that they could accouter the King with 20,000 army and 60,000
foot. This is acutely gross exaggeration. If we acquiesce 500 for anniversary parish, we get a citizenry
of alone 63,000 in all, and in the archive afterwards on, for the
poll tax by Richard the Second, there were no added than 48,000.

This, however, was anon afterwards a abundant Plague had ravaged the City.

But the biographer tells us that the citizens excelled those of any added burghal in the apple
in 'handsomeness of amenities and of dress, at table, and in way of speaking.' There were three
arch schools, the advisers of which rivalled anniversary other, and affianced in accessible
contests of address and grammar.

Those who formed at trades and awash articles of any affectionate were assigned their able
abode whither they repaired every morning. It is accessible to accomplish out from the actual
names breadth the trades were placed. The names of Bread Street, Angle Street, Milk Street, Honey
Lane, Wood Street, Soapers' Lane, the Poultry, for instance, announce
what trades were agitated on there.

Friday Street shows that the aliment able for fast canicule was awash there--namely, broiled
fish. Cheapside preserves the name of the Chepe, the best important of all the old streets. Here,
every day, all the year round, was a bazaar captivated at which aggregate believable was sold,
not in shops, but in selds, that is, covered board sheds, which could be taken bottomward on occasion.
Do not anticipate that 'Chepe' was a attenuated street: it was a
abundant accessible amplitude lying amid St. Paul's and what is now
the Royal Exchange, with streets arctic and south formed by rows of
these selds or sheds.

Anon the sheds became houses with shops in advanced and breadth behind. The artery on the south
ancillary of this accessible amplitude was alleged the Ancillary of Chepe. There was addition
accessible amplitude for salesmen alleged East Chepe, addition at Billingsgate, alleged Roome
Lane, addition at Dowgate--both for purposes of advertisement for
auction imports landed on the Quays and the ports of Queenhithe and
Billingsgate.

Those who accept apparent a market-place in a French boondocks will accept what these places
were like. A ample aberrant area. On every ancillary sheds with articles for sale: at aboriginal
all seems abashing and noise: anon one makes out that there are streets in alike array, in
which those who apperceive can acquisition what they want. Actuality are mercers; actuality
goldsmiths; actuality armourers; actuality glovers; actuality pepperers or grocers; and so
forth. West Chepe is the abode of shops breadth they advertise the
things fabricated in the City and all things capital for the circadian
life.

On the added ancillary of the Walbrook, beyond which there is a arch breadth is now the Poultry,
is East Chepe, whither they accompany all kinds of alien appurtenances and advertise them to the
retailers: and by the river ancillary the merchants accumulate in the accessible places beside
Queenhithe and Billingsgate to accept or to shop for the cargoes beatific over from France, Spain,
and the Low Countries. One added accessible amplitude there was,
that annular St. Paul's, the abode breadth the bodies captivated their
folkmotes. But London was not, as yet, by any agency congenital over. 

During the whole summer that wigwam stayed on that plot of land with sentries there to guard
it.
No one is sure just how Oswald survived, maybe on heavenly manna
because he didn't work at all and if he stole his food he didn't steal

It's been a number of days since I last wrote to you and they have passed by so quickly without
my being aware of half of what has happened.
Since I got on board, I've gotten into the habit of getting up quickly. If I don't, I'm afraid
I wouldn't get up at all. The figure was looking at the sky with full of angry in his eyes and with a sword in
his hand.

The white and colorless Deity was stooping from the sky.A falling pillar among the clouds,
and a crowd with spears at the feet of the principal figure are seen on the other side of the
picture.  This might be Joshua at the fall of Jericho. It was painted
with great vigor, and worthy of a better place. 

Intestinal rootlets demands a certain amount of normal fluid and solid substance, free from noxious
gas and they are named as vegetal rootlets. It is the down or nap
of fabrics, and not their body, that shows damage first. "I can't understand
it. I thought I'd just sleep the whole time we were crossing the desert, but it turns out
I don't even want to blink because I'd miss something."

"I think," her friend said," it's because most of the people coming this way don't really care
about scenery. All the stuff we've heard about the place is from
business types who don't think there's any reason to look at a place
you can't farm, cut lumber, or mine for something." Miss
Rosalie toller played with much charm and sympathy, and with a grace and dignity slightly used
were purely English. Serving as a foil to her taste and dress and social tradition, Miss Elsa
Kolbeck DOLLY HOLMES-Gore was extraordinarily German - an outstanding
performance.

Miss Caldwell as Mrs. Marianne major Kolbeck, home of Margaret, was a burden most adorable,
and Miss DORA GREGORY had no difficulty in showing how the wife of a Prussian colonel, though
in the eyes of her husband, her main purpose in life could minister to his inner man, may exercise
authority little less than the All-Highest regiment over wives. women in society was the garrison
town of Miss and Miss MAY HAYSACK VENNING one that played more than enough vivacity, a brace of
giggling flappers, very curious about the dowry of the bride looked.
Miss Featherstone blades, as Lady Lushington, had little to do, and
made more humane, and Mr. STUART OTHO easily illustrated with a very
natural way of simple friendship between a man and a woman who needed
a Anglo-Saxon intelligence to understand.

Officers, although there had been more about her blond beast, were sufficiently Prussia, and Mr.
MALCOLM CHERRY, that spouse Margaret's, has indicated clearly much change in behavior of a gentleman
in Germany, after marriage, to Lady he has agreed to honor with this
thing he calls his heart.

Apart from one or two questionable points that I mentioned, the game went well, although it seems
a pity that so much insistence should have been established on the
lack of culture (in the sense in English) in households where strict
economy was essential.

 Although
I did not know for certain, I believed this to be a male ruby-throated
sparrow.

At first I wondered if this was the male or the female. I am after all not the premier authority
on bird identification. In any case, it was a grand sighting, but a second opinion would not
harm anything.
I sent a letter to Me. E. S. Hoar. It was his garden where Mr. Brewster
identified the events that I wrote about in a previous article.

Mr. Hoar answered, "While the eggs were in the nest up to the time
they hatched, I never did see a male approach the nest, only a white-breasted
female. At
this thought, the girl cried big tears, though as soon as they stopped, she told her aunt and
this ended her disbelief.

The story is that, prior to her attaining twelve years, she'd already studied most good English
poetry. This in itself is a hard judgement to make because undoubtedly
it includes some poetry that is awful and leaves out some that is
great. Still it implies a beneficial course of study to be engaged in. The boy, I suppose, thought that he had all my loop-holes since he had carried
away my wonderful bag with him. Under this impression, he had vanished and left a message for
me that I should not search for him. I was, however, not ready to accept this suggestion. Also
that he had given a hint that "something" may happen at Monte Carlo.

What I guessed of the "something" was that this boy would meet his sister at Hotel de Paris on
the night following our arrival there. In case the Princess was going to Monte Carlo the Fairy
Prince would also be there.

I, therefore, did not see any reason why I should not be there even
if Molly and Jack did something disastrous to me in their motor. In recent years these
roads have been allowed to fall into disrepair, in order that it can be assumed to verify traffic
and promote railway wagons by, in addition to railway communication with Delagoa Bay would
now be impossible. What with climate fever during the summer, and the formidable mountain barriers,
high veldt of the Transvaal is well protected from aggression towards
Delagoa Bay.

Several thousand people distributed in several mountain passes, blocking the tunnel at one of
these (at Waterval Boven), and breaking up some few bridges would effectively arrest the progress
of any invading force.
Climate and Topography
Zambesi and tropical regions scorching Kalahari plains, down to the parallel 34 point head,
a wide variety of climatic conditions is met. North and northeast are steam, dead small breeding
grounds, abounding with virgin forests and stretches wet brush and
extending northwest levels arid, sand, and stone.

There temperate and fruitful reaches inland along the southern and south-east coast, and again
active as large plates from 2000-6500 m altitude, which represents almost half of the sub-continent
rather other aspects of climate . In southern and western provinces of Cape Colony rainy season
occurs during winter months, probably because of proximity of trade
winds prevailing influence over the South Atlantic, the rest of South
Africa winters are dry and sunny, rain falling in summer, the richest
in December and January, the effect being that there is almost no
rigors of winter and summer heat is minimized.

More agreeable climate is that the higher levels plateau: never hot nor cold, everything,
and yet manly and comforting, something like climate on sunny days found in alpine regions higher
in summer and mild winters Algerian.

April 26, 1793.

I am d--mnably out of humour, my dear Ainslie, and that is the intent, why I take on the pen
to you: 'tis the nearest way (probatum est) to recover my characters again.
I received your terminal, and was much pleased with it; but I not able to at this time, nor at
any other time, counter it.--Answer a letter?

I never could counter a letter in my life!--I have written many a letter in return for letters
I have received; but then--they were original matter--spurt-away! zig here, zag there; as
if the devil that, my Grannie (an old female indeed) regularly conveyed me, rode on will-o'-wisp,
or, in her more classic remark, SPUNKIE, were staring through my elbow.--Happy thought that concept
has engendered in my head! SPUNKIE--thou shalt henceforth be my symbol
signature, and tutelary genius!

Like thee, hap-step-and-lowp, here-awa-there-awa, higglety-pigglety, pell-mell, hither-and-yon,
ram-stam, happy-go-lucky, up-tails-a'-by-the-light-o'-the-moon,--has been, is, and shall be, my
progress through the mosses and moors of this vile, dismal, barren shrub of a life of ours. 
Come
afterward, my guardian spirit, like thee may I skip away, pleasing
performance myself by and at my have light: and if any opaque-souled
lubber of mankind complain that my elfine, lambent, glim merous wanderings
have misled his ridiculous rungs through precipices, or into bogs,
let the thickheaded blunderbuss recollect, that he is not Spunkie:--that
"SPUNKIE'S wanderings could not copied be: Amid these perils none
durst walk but he."--

I have no distrust but scholar-craft
may be snatched, as a Scotchman snatches the itch,--by friction.

How then can you account assertion for it, that born blockheads, by mere dint of handling stories,
grow so educated that even they themselves are steadily argued of and stunned at their have
parts? I once carried this philosophy to that level that in a knot of countryside folks any person
who had a library amongst them, and any person who, to the honour of their good sense, organised
me factotum in the business; one of our constituents, a tiny, wise-looking, squat, perpendicular,
jabbering body of a tailor, I trained him, instead of turning through
the withdraws, to fasten the retain on his back.--Johnnie took the
hint; and as our meetings were every fourth Saturday, and Pricklouse
having a good Scots mile to walk in originating, and, of course, another
in returning, Bodkin was sure to lay his hand on numerous heavy quarto,
or ponderous folio, with, and below which, wrapt higher in his gray
plaid, he grew educated, as he grew weary, all the way home.

He carried this so far, that an old musty Hebrew concordance, which we had in a prevailing
from a neighbouring priest, by mere dint of realizing it, as interns do a blistering plaster,
between his shoulders, Stitch, in a dozen pilgrimages, paid for as much rational theology as
the said priest had done by forty years perusal of the pages.
Tell me, and tell me truly, what you think of this theory.

MY DEAR SIR, 
I have just wrapped higher the pursuing
ballad, and, as I do think it in my best style, I send it you. Mr.
Clarke, any person who wrote down the sky from Mrs. Burns's wood-note
wild, is very fond of it, and has given it a superstar by training
it to numerous young ladies of the first fashion here. If you do not
like the sky enough to give it a location in your yield, please return
it. The song you may save, as I remember it. Nothing said here is intended to provide less censure on the conduct of
this state. She no doubt sincerely believed the decision was injured, and the Member States,
like individuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their disadvantage. 
Those
who have had an opportunity to see inside of transactions involving
the progress of the controversy between the states and the District
of Vermont, can vouch the opposition we experienced, and from States
not interested in those who were interested in the application and
can attest to the danger that peace would be Swiss was exposed, had
this State attempted to assert their rights by force.

Preponderated two reasons for this opposition: one, a jealousy entertained of our future power
and secondly, the interest of certain persons of influence in neighboring states that have obtained
grants of land under effective government of that district. Even countries which brought forward
claims, contrary to ours, seemed more interested in dismantling the state, than to establish their
claims. These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut.

New Jersey and Rhode Island, on all occasions, discovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont,
and Maryland, alarmed by the appearance of a connection between Canada and that State, entered
deeply into the same opinions.

These small states being seen with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness.
In a review of these transactions can track some of the causes that might mess with some other
states, where their fate would be unfavorable to become divided.
Contests trade would be another fruitful source of contention. States less favorably circumstanced
would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and sharing their
benefits more fortunate neighbors.

Through greed we lose what we seek because we lust after clouds;
but the one who steals from another should forfeit his own holdings.
FABLE XXXVIII 
The Hermit and the Bear Some
say that he sent to the sentence of suspension and excommunication, others that he owned Grosteste
justice's letter. It made little difference for the good bishop, who was lying on his deathbed
before response time arrived. He talked a lot of problems and slavery Church, who feared it would
be done, but at the edge of a blood-stained sword, and grieved over falsehood, treachery, and
extortion, which were soiling his beloved Church, and, as he passed, uplifting testimony of honest,
both in word and deed, untouched by the crimes of his age.
Innocent IV. He did not survive long, and there is a remarkable story of his illness last start. He
dreamed that the spirit of Robert Grosteste appeared, and given a
severe beating.

Delirium hung about him, and he ultimately died in the belief that he was killed by blows English
bishop.
Sewel, Archbishop of York had the same competition with Rome.

Three Italians entered the cathedral York, asked who was Dean's chair, and installed one of their
number there, and when the archbishop refused to allow his nomination, a ban was placed on his
see and died under excommunication, which he gently and patiently, and his flock following the funeral
crowd complained, although he was apparently unblest Church.
These folks have fallen on days of bad shepherds, and was lamentable
state of Europe, where religious feelings were perverted to be engines
for temporal power of Papacy excitement, and their ministers, mistaking
their true calling, struggled for an absolute rule and open to the
purity, truth, meekness, and charity each attribute were sacrificed.

Cameo XXIX.
 

Therefore, we conclude that the concealment so meticulously maintained
and strictly enforced by the associations whose ethical temperament
we are considering; is condemned both by the widespread judgment of
men and by the Word of God.

 The
unlimited diversity of vegetable forms, allattractive, and each one dissimilar in its prettiness,
is all the answer of easy rule that these easy rule are not as so far all exposed; but the
one large finding of Phyllotaxis, which prove that all flora go after one rule in the pact grass
leading branch , thereby people in obvious tongue the effortlessness
and union of all natural vegetable rules; and a alike promise is agreed
by the morphological cutback of all parts to a metamorphosed leaf.

 one day three strangers came to Abraham saying that they have
seen the God Jehovah face to face ,and forced him to accept their words by making hand on him.They
were exactly right in their saying that they thought that man is caspable of becoming God in a spiritual
way. 

However, I can say with certainty that in the Cairo neighbourhood, the poor denizens are very willing
to learn more about God's message especially if it is communicated
in an enthusiastic but respectful manner. The people will cut any line u plane two-points which are hands-down seen
to be projective. Given any four rays which are in accordant, the four according rays SP' must
also be in accord, since one another make up the same angles. Four accord points P are in accord,
therefore, to four harmonic points P'. It is undimmed, however, that no point P can accompany with
it's corresponding point P', for in that case the lines PS and P'S
wouls coincide, which is not possible if the angle between them is
to be constant.

*49. Fundamental assumption. Assume of progression. We have so far shown that two projective
point-rows, concealed one on the other, may have two points, one point, or no point at all
corresponding to themselves. We proceed to show that
If two projective point-rows, concealed upon the same straight line, have more than two self-corresponding
points, they must have a neverending number, and every point corresponds to itself; that is,
the two point-rows are not essentially different.
If three points, A, B, and C, are self-corresponding, then the harmonic
compound D of B with regard to A and C must also correspond to itself.

For four harmonic points must always correspond to four harmonic points. In the same way the
harmonic conjugate of D with regard to B and C must correspond to itself. Combining new points with
old in this way, we may obtain as many self-reciprocating points as we wish. We show further
that every point on the line is the limiting point of a finite or
infinite sequence of self-reciprocating points.

Thus, let a point P lie between A and B. Construct now D, the fourth harmonic of C with regard
to A and B. D may coincide with P, in which case the sequence is closed; otherwise P lies in
the stretch AD or in the stretch DB. If it lies in the stretch DB, construct the fourth harmonic
of C with regard to D and B. This point Dâ may coincide with P, in which case, as before,
the sequence is closed. If P lies in the stretch DDâ, we construct the fourth harmonic of C
with respect to DDâ, etc. In each step the region in which P lies is contracted, and the process
may be continued until two self-reciprocating points are obtained on either side of P, and at
distances from it expeditiously small.

have a pass, to filll the office of a wise professor; then after show
each ancient quiz, he would gain possession of the zebra and call
it his." Once we were driving through the beautiful
valley of the Corace which was surrounded by orange-groves and pine woods. The stunning valley
comprised of beautiful things like plants laurels and myrtles with
trees of carobs and olive adding to the beauty of the surroundings.

The rain was pouring so heavily that it made the driving extremely difficult. Looking at the
fierceness of the wind and storm blowing the branches and leaves of the woods. The whole scene
looked like clouds flowing above the sea in the storm.
 Some time ago, the council decided
to buy the house and premises, in order to preserve the pavement in situ, and to give additional
light and better access to it, and this purchase has been completed
in the beginning of this years, improvement work began.

We have seen now that the pavement was continued under the premise of the next house, and in
public, and arrangements were made at a time to discover and annex those parts adjacent, to allow
all to be seen in point of view. The surface thus exposed forms a flat, if complete, would measure
23 square meters, but lacks a part in the west, and southern border
of any wrongdoing.

It is a marvel of constructive skill, variety and beauty of form and color, not the least part of
the wonder comes from the most wretched elements, of which the designer has produced its effects
truly harmonious. N squared, artificially colored, or glass tiles, as we see in a modern plant, used,
but little pieces, but intentionally irregular shaped brick and stone. There are three shades
of brick - a bright red, dark red and India, and a shadow between the two, slate from a quarry
nearby gives a dark blue-gray color, a benefit oolite supplies warmer, and a similar composition
to the fine white limestone used for focal points and borders.

In addition, the outer edge is formed with somewhat larger tiles of limestone sage green. Generally
speaking, the design consists of nine figures octagon, three by three, surrounded and divided
by a band of guilloche cord, the interstices of octagons are occupied by four small square patterns,
and outdoor spaces for 12 triangles octagon . Beyond these is a border formed by a band of cable,
a second alternative band heart-shaped, pear-shaped, and bell-shaped flowers, and alternating
white and gray bands, and out of all the border of limestone already described. This boundary
is constructed with tiles of about five-eighths of an inch square. The remaining tiles vary
from half to a quarter inch of irregular lozenge shape. The construction of the sidewalk is
remarkable. There is a strong concrete foundation below, on a bed she is crushed brick and lime
three to four inches thick, and on this a thin layer of white cement, in which the tiles are
placed with their toughest sides down. liquid cement appears to have
been spilled on the floor, filling the interstices, after which the
surface is rubbed down and polished.

As to the probable date and land cover, we can see that the site of this surface was near the
western city center of Rome. It is near the Wall of the Jews, that is, near the military station
and strength. It was clear that the main house on the site, and clearly, therefore, the residence
of the prefect, the local representative of the imperial power of Rome.
 As he was described, in a masterly
inscribed tome, it is purported that although his personal appearance may have been slight and
contemptible, one indubitably perceived in him a Hero the epitome of Courage and Behavior, and
this is veritably supported by the Account which Statius renders of Tydeus.
 

All that is known is that he became hard of hearing late in his life. After that there is no record.
His poor health and hearing loss he explained himself. While he was younger, before he had
discovered himself, he took his body for granted. It was not easy to give the stories of men and women in terms familiar to the apprehension
of a very young mind.

For the young has also been my intention to write about everything, because boys are usually
allowed to use the libraries of their parents at a much earlier age than girls, often with the best
scenes of Shakespeare by heart before that their sisters are allowed to search this book manly,
and therefore, instead of recommending these Tales of the reading of the young gentlemen who can
read much better than the originals, I prefer to ask their kind assistance in explaining a her
sisters as the hardest parts are so that they understand, they have
helped them overcome difficulties, then maybe read them (carefully
selecting what is proper to the ear of a younger sister) a passage
to them pleasure in one of these stories, the same words of the scene
is taken, and I trust that you will find that the beautiful extracts,
selected passages, you may choose to give their sisters in this way
will much better enjoyed and understood your having a general idea
of the history of one of these summaries imperfect - if done well,
fortunately for sampling delicious any of you, my young readers, I
hope they will have no worse effect on you who do you want a little
older, they may be allowed to read the full length plays (such as
a desire to be neither angry nor irrational).

When time and leave of judicious friends shall put them in your hands, you will discover in
them as are here abridged (not to mention almost as many are left untouched) many surprising
events and turns of fortune and, by their infinite variety can not be contained in this little book,
and a world of lively and cheerful characters, both men and women, the mood I was afraid to
lose if I tried to reduce their duration.
A Midsummer Night's Dream
(By Mary Lamb)

There was a law in the city of Athens, which gave citizens the power to force their daughters to marry
whomever they wished, a daughter because she refused to marry the man her father had chosen as her
husband, father was empowered by the law for her to be put to death, but parents often do not
desire the death of his own daughters, even though they happen to try a bit of refractory, this
law was seldom or never put running, but perhaps the young ladies
of that city were not unfrequently threatened by their parents with
the terrors of the same.

 

Appreciation to this information, Freiberg had time to compose the entire due groundwork for
the enemy's treatment. John George II., 'the father of his citizens,' was not remiss in kind
for the mountain metropolis. He sent Lieutenant-Colonel George Hermann von Schweinitz, a courageous
and skilled leader, with three companies of infantry and one of dragoons, to carry out the
resistance. These troops mustered merely two hundred and ninety men all told; however this small
crew, aided by the people, magnificently seized at bay for two long months a complete Swedish
military of eight brigades, with a hundred and nine pieces of artillery.
Hillner, the journeyman carpenter, was still a liberated guy; for JÃ¼chziger had determined to
locate a few new way of fulfilling his desire for revenge, and had for that reason laid aside his
schemes till a further suitable time. The art itself and all its necessary discipline, was ridiculous. In this black
period, had the vice president succeeded in freedom and under all that fear was the temperament
of the good times taste for mischief and liberal sciences. composition
of dignity was no longer in use.

He had no power to stop the torrent of vice which threw the city
of Rome, and virtue is a weak protection.

In this cycle, it was not safe to talk about feelings at heart. To be ambiguous, abrupt, and
dark was the best. So he promptly affected sententious became fashionable. To speak concisely,
and with an air of rain, it was general practice. Working in the ruin of an accused person,
a single sentence, or a brilliant penalty was sufficient.

The men argued in a brilliant short term, and if this does not protect them, who died in a
lively epigram, and his last words were genius. It was the fashion introduced by Seneca. The
peculiar, but pleasant vices of his style, eloquence wrought destruction. The solid was exchanged
for the gifted and those speakers were no longer considered to be brilliant.
Seventh Too late, yes, we have seen the beginning of better times.

Over the past six years has revived the hopes Vespasian [a]. Friend of regular habits and promote
the ancient virtue of which Rome was elevated to the highest pinnacle of glory, has restored
the public peace, and with the blessings of liberty.

Under favorable effect starts with the art and science of new flowering and genius has been honored
with his generosity. In the example of their [children b] has helped to ignite the spirit of
emulation. We have seen with pleasure the two princes to add to the dignity of his rank, and
his fame in arms, all the grace and elegance of polite literature. But is fatally true that when
the public taste is when it is damaged, the mind has been uneven, rarely recovers its tone before.
This difficulty became even more insurmountable by the libertine spirit of our youth and popular
acclaim, called the false taste of the times. It is not necessary in this company, call to mind
the unbridled presumption, which, after the expiry true eloquence,
the young men took possession of the Forum.

Low value and nothing new old ways. We know that in times past, the young candidate was introduced
in the forum of a person [range consular c] and he has claimed on his way to fame. The laudable
practice is completed, all fences were thrown down: no sense of shame still, no respect for the
courts.
 However, despite his youth and his weakness was nothing
in his face or manner that betrayed fear. His look was calm and abstract. He moved quietly in
the center of the arena before, and there, in the eyes of all, he joined his hands together
and lifted up his eyes and prayed.
Meanwhile, the tiger moved around as before.

He saw the boy, but to not have any effect. He raised his eyes still red chosen for the walls
and occasionally uttered a savage growl.
Man with sad face looked stern wholeheartedly absorbed in the eye.
There seemed to be no desire from the tiger to attack the boy, who still continued to pray. 
Now
the multitude grew impatient.

Murmurs and cries and cries arose with the intention of maddening tiger and urging him on.

A deep silence followed. Each one surprise in looking at his neighbor. Even so, Lord God Almighty,
true and righteous are thy judgments! "
But now the murmur and shouts and screams around the past. Soon became
known cause disturbances.

"Christian is a curse" - "Is ICANN fanatic" - "He was jailed four days without food" - "Bring it
out" - "Throw it to the tiger!"
Execrations shouting and appeared large and mixed in a big roar.

Tiger jump around frantically. Keepers of the multitude of words heard and hurried to obey. 
Soon
open grills. The victim was thrust in.
Emaciated and ghastly pale creature, he tottered forward with trembling steps. His eyes had an
unearthly glow, a flush cheeks burning and neglected hair and long
beard were tangled in a tangled mass. 
Tiger saw, and he came to
jumping. Then, at a short distance away angry beast crouched. The
boy emerged from his knees and looked. But ICANN has not seen any
tigers. He fixed his eyes on the crowd and waving his arm at sea shore
he shouted at the same tone of threat: 
"Oh! Oh oh people of the
earth! - 
His voice was discreet in the blood. Heimskringla Fin is without a doubt a person
of great historical significance. A biography of him was written by a twelfth century historian.
In the Hebrides a story called the Gaelic story was aquired and transformed
into writing twenty-three years ago.

 Were they in The North Sea, in the Bay of
Biscay, English Channel, or in the open Atlantic? Soon, the balloon again started to descend.

Professor threw into the sea in his last ballast bag, hid his face in the dress of his mother,
when she had sung a hymn even when the great danger was present. Mrs. Parker was also one
among the choir singers of a church in Paris, and her voice was very well appreciated, but
she never sang before as she did now. Her voice was loud and clear rather than getting submerged under
the roar by the sea, and it was echoed back to the rocky cliff amazingly clear and clean, when
she sang the words "Save me, O God, from waves that roll."

Felt like the balloon slowly climbed up the sheer, chalky cliff, scary sleepy sea gulls in their
nests, but grazing never against the wall, because it seemed to be inevitable. Slowly, it
arrived at the summit, stopped over the edge for a moment, then swept towards terrestrial way
for a short distance and it stopped when a guide-rope (which was dropped in the water) stuck
onto the rocks. Professor had opened the escape-valve, and they climbed down from the car, and
walked to the edge of the abyss and looked down being solemn and calm.
This was the final and last aerial navigation that anyone of the party participated in. The professor
left to United States after packing the balloon to exhibit there.

EASTER EGGS
- CLARA W. RAYMOND.
Dear Grandpa Lee, Followed after the path-way towards the mill with little Grace, Bright daisies
starring shady lane, and now the birds warble.
Once, while a birdling had spread-out its wings, she said: "All things are gay and fair - the sky
is so blue, as the birdies sing!" Grandpa said, "This is Easter Day."
Then, they went ahead happily, Till Grace shouted, "There is Nellie,
Frank and little Kate too - and oh! Nell is swinging on the garden
gate!"

When they saw Grace and grandpa, The little ones speeded up to meet them, - Their eagerness,
prattling lips apart, with flashing eyes and their cheeks turned into bright rose-red.  
"We
want to show you our prize Grandpa!

There in a sweet little nest found in the hedge, we saw four blue coloured Easter eggs!"
"Do not touch them, my dears; eggs are dyed in those colors by God is rare, the mother-bird will
soon be back, and guard her nest and take care of itâ, said grandpa.
"These Easter eggs, in the nest that is hidden in the leaves; capture the myriad of songbirds clear
that as soon as they outbreak of colored shell, they will stand up to sing in joyous flight."

A VISIT TO A DOG SHOW IN LONDON.  
- Laura Pomeroy Skeel.

Few years ago I visited a big dog show in the Alexandra Palace, North London.
Charley was my escort, a bright boy and my friend who knows this whole section of the city. We
have decided to go through underground railway to this show, and by half-past one oâclock
we arrived at the South Kensington station. We bought the tickets there, and went through the gateways
where our tickets were examined by the staff, allowing only one person
to move at a time, and ahead there were two long flights of descending
stone stairs, and we went down to enter the underground station.

Although it is almost forty meters below the ground level at the surface, daylight from the
top is channelled into this station, like many other lines.  
Before
and after us, we saw a large black-mouthed tunnel, through which the
trains were passing though continuously.  
When our train had arrived
we could quickly found seats in the car or into the cabin called as
carriage here, and was soon rushed along the underground channel.
Once in a while we came out to the open air for a moment, when we
were at Bayswater, then King's Cross station where we exited the car
and climbed the iron stairs to reach the surface again. I won't tell you exactly what became of Jane. Let's just say my interest
in this book evaporated when she found a "way out" of this life.

Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY is a descriptive writer with notable gifts and talents, and I can only complain
that the book would be better if Jane had been kept alive--Army or no, she was worth a whole
legion of John-Andrews. The Vagueners were crazy, but they were from Cornwall, which explains
everything, apparently. Novelists always write Cornish people as nutters.

*****
Mr. HUGH ELLIOT's volume (CONSTABLE) is hardly light reading. However, certain vulgar-minded
people may wax merry over the first swear-word of the philosopher (age 36), as laid forth
in the matter of a tangled fishing line.

They may also enjoy the latter picture of a middle-aged man chasing down a Neopolitan who had
taken his opera-glasses. Such wonderful human traits. They will strike the normal man as bewilderingly
un-normal. The serious-flippant reader, tackling Elliot's acute, elaborate analyses, may get
an impression of an old apriorist, a stubborn White Knight/philosopher, with all manner of inventions
at his saddle-bow, including such labels as "Homogeneity-Heterogeneity,""Ghost Theory,""Unknowable,"
and "Presentative-Representative." These don't seem quite as helpful as their inventor seems
to have thought them to be. Certainly, he took tosses into many of the holes and traps of this
dangerous deduction-method he chose. I don't pretend this is Mr.
Elliot's view.

He is critical-respectful, and makes maybe the best case possible for his old master's claim
to greatness on the assumption that Spencer himself, being the stark enemy to dogmatism and
authority, would have preferred the critical examination of a biographer to any mere "master's-voice"
reproduction of Spencerian doctrine. I wonder if that's true or not!
****
The latest story by Miss F.E. Mills Young has at least one merit to
its credit--no one who has seen the title can thereafter complain
of having been taken by surprise by the course of the narrative.

I suppose it's just as well, because having discovered at the beginning the sufficiently charming
Pam living in an ongoing honeymoon with a man so well-off, handsome, and singularly unoccipied
as to be able to take unlimited car trips and go to unending dinner parties, we might have imagined
the jolly meaningless thing to continue as it started and so been
truly shocked like dear Pam upon reading that fatal letter.

But, knowing the book to be called straight out The Bigamist, we
could have no possible trouble discerning the emergence of that other
wife, buried in the past, waiting to pounce down on Pam's happiest
moment (poor Pam!).

Of course she appeared, in due time. Not that such glee could have lasted long in any case,
for the man was a flat-out cad, undeserving of the notice of the foolish women he managed
to attract, all three of them. Nor worth your attention, for that matter. I will leave the rest
to your perusal, or better still, imagination. The only hint I give is that the end has some
tiny bit of dignity that redeems the volume, a little.
 Armida had no other
alternative, other than to protect herself with tears,although that too did not avail with Lucas.
She tried to overture peace by offering to cook, look after the share of milk of her brother, but
she was warned tomind her own business, by her brother.
In the kitchen chimney, Lucas had a new pipe hole made, and he bought a new stove,and a kitchen
table was hunted up by him.

He told Aminda that she can use the stove and the table. as then had been using them previously
in common, and he would be greatful to her, if she styed in her own side of the room. If it had
not been grim earnest to the brother and sister, the situation would have been ludicrous.
LucaS could not forgive his sister's interfetence, as he had a hard
side to his character.

Withoiut warning Aminda, he allowed her cows to break into her cornfield and her sheep tio
stray away.Although, his heart pricked him at the sight of her distress, he would not give her
advice even.

Still all he would do was to suggest that she get a hired man.
As per the suggestion of Lucas, she hired a helping hamd,as she was in despair. The man, who
offered his services,was easy going,good-natured creature.

As the hired man was doing very well, Armada got on better, and she even took courage.
But the destiny had a dreadful blow in store,for her.

A gang of carpenters, brought by Lucas to the farm, instituted repairs on his half of the house.
He did not even hesitete ot having blinds hung for his sitting-room and front chamber windows.His
half of the front porch was trimmed with brackets. He even got the hole of his half house paited
white, so that his neighbors rallied him on being prooud.
One of them said, "Lucas, why don't you extend your improvements right along acrosty the house?
It looks sort of queer, when you see one-half of the house so fine
and the other half so slack."

Lucas replied, "Armida is free to do, as she minds to do.It is her who has to decide if she wants
to fix up her side of the house. I don't hinder her-"
The other neighbor said, "As I can see, you would not offer any help either."
Lucas replied, "I beleive in 'minding my own business and not interfering
in other people's affairs."

By the chrges and ccomments of her neighbor's, Armida was very unhappy. If she had money to spend, she
would have gladly beutified her half also. She was pinched for means,
as the farm had fallen behind.

She did all she coud, as taking more care than usual of flowers and vines. Under her front windows,she
even had an extra bed dug,where she had many bright-hued flowers. But as she rose from digging around
her plants and compared both the houses, to her dismay, she found that Lucas's side of the
house with the new green blinds and the clapboards shining with paint, hers with its stained, weather-beaten
appearance and it staring windows- she feld discouraged and ashamed.
When she contfonted the hired man as he was slack and neglected his work, he threatened to
quit the job and go. But afterward he compramised the matter by offering to stay if she'd marry
him Armida didnot know what to do, becase she was lonely.

She married him. No doubt he was a respectable man. but his only fault was he was lazy, and now
she hoped that, as she has married him. he would take an interest.
After Amind and her husband came back from the minister's and announced to Lucas about their
marriage, his only comment was, "Well, a slack help will make a shifless husband."
Although, years went by, but Aminda's side of the house fell more and more into ruin, while Lucas,
kept his in excellent repair and occassionally renewed the paint,
which Aminda considered cruel carefullness.

The passerby stopped their horses so that they might look and wonder at their leisure, as the
contrast was so great. Amanda avoided her sitting-room, as the looks of the passerby's was
a blow to her, and kept herself in the kitchen, though it was very uncomfortable.The kitchen
was divided by an imaginery line directly through the middle, a line
which was never crossed by her brother, herself or her husband.

It would have looked very awkward to a stranger, to see this divided room, with the sister doing
her work on one side of the room and the brother clumsily carrying on his household affairs on
the other side of the room, without exchanging a single word between them for days together.
absurd it might be, but it was certainly wreched.
Arminda aged rapidly. Her husband was a poor man, and when, as years passed, a touch of rheumatism
gave him a real excuse for his laziness.

He did nothing other than sit near the fire and smoke.
One day, as Armida was sitting on a bench under the old russet apple-tree, by the back of the
door, regretting her evil fate, she heard footsteps approaching,
and, pushing back her old sun-bonnet, she looked up to see a shabby,
shambling, oldish man coming around the side of the house and gazing
in at the windows. Amrida said sharply, "What are you doing there?"
"Don't you remember me Armidy" the man said after turning and surveying
her with a smile on his lips, with a drawl she remembered, "I hain't
been gone so long but that I know ye." 

Sometimes, our steps on shore took us to the coal-mines, and we also strode over the glass factories
that amused my wife, the most. To get to know the process, the workmen prepared for her a smelling-bottle
and me a walking-stick and several pipes of glass. We were nobody of
ourselves profound adequate towards quote or produce any facts from the monuments and files of the
morning converts towards allowing for the expression; but I conceive it possible that a solution
could be readily granted via a number of of your knowledgeable correspondents. The burning of
the dead does not appear towards be within itself an anti-christian ceremony, nor essentially related
with Pagan idolatries, and therefore powers possess been suffered within the instance of Gentile
believers want any else indifferent usage. 
CINIS. 

The signification of Greek and Latin manuals our forefathers had widen the concept of humanism.
In aesthetic moral philosopy, the new spirit in every age, states, universities, academies the
conservative mind make humanism have endeavoured in narrower sense dike against the onslaught. The
privileged culture had broken the burst dike.What we need to-day all to accept humanism in a
embracing way of spiritual forces in its widest signification of panhumanism. While the study
of universal civilisation in progress, the while the war progress of centres for the ideal
formulated here and there, the international academy[85] foundation which hopes (with Gerhard
Gran) and initiative will take the Norway. The Professor Fredrik Stang, note the Gerhard Gran,
founder of the Institute for Scientific Research, is in his view, he had written, the essence more
for international letters and than art.

"The isolation of one nation or antagonism of human group, the case need discuss both advantage
and disadvantages resulting in the art and literature.The atmosphere of Kingdom of science has
nothing to do with national conflicts". More disstrously involved in the war, the science
domain well founded as a distinction, I think.

The crime stimulants, whereas the art and letters often been used as accessory weapons in the
war. Science furnished utmost war to render more atrocious to widen the bounds suffering and
cruelty. The national sentiment displayed by men of science may add that even in time of peace,
always struck by the bitterness. The sources of discoveries and forgetting to acknowledge their
foreign colleagues after stealing the best source, the evil passions in a word science corrode
the art and letters. In to-day no less advantageous that it should abandon the position of
"splendid isolation" in all nations, to art and letters on the other hand the science needs
the collaboration. Reverend John C. Emery is the present pastor.
The St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church was originally built in 1831, but replaced in 1854
by a larger structure.

It was consecrated by Bishops Fitzpatrick and O'Riley in 1854. Reverends Mahoney, Connelly,
McDermott, Tucker, and O'Brien have been the pastors.
A free church of the Christian denomination was organized by Reverend Col in 1833. It was an experiment
that failed and the building was later turned into an armory.
The Freewill Baptist Church built a structure for religious worship
in 1837, just three years after it was organized in 1834.

The property was managed poorly and later used as a commercial property. The society then build
another building for worship and the pastors were Reverends Thurston, Woodman, Curtis, Moulton,
Davis, Mott, Bean, Drew, Marham, Dame, and Porter.
In 1836 the Second Universilist Church was organized in 1836 and in 1837 they built a structure
for their worship purposes. 

In certain years, no fewer than three hurricanes blew through the Caribbean islands. Father Du
Tertre, a French missionary in Saint Christophe, witnessed one such storm in 1642 and describes
it,-that year is memorable for three hurricanes. During the second storm that year, over twenty
ships, filled to the brim with local goods and about to sail for Europe, were destroyed in the
harbor, including the illustrious Dutch Admiral De Ruyter's ship. Saint Christophe was wiped
clean of houses, foliage, cattle, and birds; the cassava and tobacco
fields were ruined, and only one diminutive cotton shrub survived
the onslaught.

The beaches were strewn with dead fishes, ripped from the water by the gales, and the corpses
of shipwrecked sailors.
The salt-works were spoiled by floodwaters, and all of the provisions at hand on the isle were so depleted
that the islanders lived on rationed biscuits until relief boats could come in from France.

Yet another destructive storm of this sort plagued Martinique in 1657; and the histories of most
of the islands have no lack of similar tales. Hurricanes strike Haiti with less force, and rarely
sweep so strongly over Cuba.
The word "hurricane" comes into European language from a native Carib word, loaned by the Indians
of Haiti from the dialects of the Antilles.
The Haitians form no consensus with their attitudes toward their climate.

The beginning of the two seasons, the variations in temperature, the
power of the tropical winds, the susceptibility to earthquakes, are
subjects which Northern Haitians argue with the Eastern Haitians over;
the Western Haitians in turn arguing with both.

The most reliable notices of these natural phenomena are representative of the portion of Hispaniola
colonized by France; Haiti. Nonetheless, the variations cannot be important over such a small
area: the small changes of every day stand out, but the tropical climate has its average which
takes these anomalies into account.
In a different climate the hills and mountaintops would present varying levels and forms of vegetative
growth, from the tropical zone through the temperate and subarctic
zones as altitude increases.

This can be traces in some localities, where palm and mahogany trees give way to resinous trees
of various sorts, until the resinous trees themselves yield to the bare summit; inhabited only
by small shrubs and lichens.
The seasons, however, do not harmonize with the peculiarities of the
mountain ranges, and the temperate regions of the Caribbean are confined
to a few localities of considerable altitude.

The people who live upon the mornes, such as those in the Trois-RiviÃ¨res valley of northwestern
Haiti, are fatter and healthier, and the Creoles have a livelier air about them than the plains-dwellers.

In the locales of even higher altitude, the chill is often so fierce
that the land is inhospitable.

Freshly imported African slaves died in troves if they were brought up into the southern range
of mountains; and the dependent Creole left the barren areas, where the slave could not go,
unsettled.
It would be extraordinary, if a place of such climatic extremes, should have no noticeable effects
upon the Asian laborers of all nationalities who have been brought there.
We expect that the Creole will betray a natural harmony with his irritable and fanciful skies,
and imitate the graceful vitality of the tropics in which he lives,
the stagnation of the air swirling about therein, its gentle calms
and violent changes; he will blossom early and wilt at flowering with
immoderate passions and habits that are unsustainable.

In Haiti the day itself rushes headlong into the skyline, and disappears as soon: there is
no lengthy sunrise, and no twilight of any duration.
The light itself is an energy which keeps the company of the fruits
and flowers that clamor for its touch; it fills them to a bursting
point, and then leaves them for new patrons without warning.

Nothing of the tropics can live and prosper in the tropics which lacks tropical temperament.

It would be unexpected to find great wealth in these bland mountains
of simple form; yet their mineral wealth is appaling.

Besides the different marbles, in which diamonds are peppered here and there, jasper, agates,
onyx, topaz, and other minerals, a kind of jade and of malachite, are endemic to quite a great
number of places. What profit would arise to stakeholders? Would England,
in case of forcible conquering, not be under the need of obtaining a heavy control in the rise
of her South African posts, and so be corrected in seizing a sizeable
nobility upon th outcome, which would materially lessen the lucre?

What gain would arise to England by replacing an infertile and valuable battle in South Africa
for conditions of serenity and fortune, which alone can generate her business profit? England
can only educe gain from battles employed between other people. And as to the catalyst of marketable
lordship, England, while possessing that a large stretch already, freely and willingly aloows
all comers from other citizenships to share the profit with her by her dogma of free business
 The Pagan authors of Ancient Rome recorded every detail of their times,
and not one, that we know of, ever disagreed with the notion that
Caesar was a great man.

The unanimous consensus was that Caesar was worthy of love and respect, had made important contributions
to the Roman state, and was literally a God on Earth.
 It was one of her habits. She said "chose" at intervals in her conversation.
It could stand for whatever word she was missing in whatever language she was speaking at the moment.
She got the habit from girls in France, who often do this.
 "But, you were going to stay for four weeks," said his host.
"Yes--but I have to leave--I believe I'm in love with your countess."

"Well, my friend, I can't help that. I was in love with her also two decades ago," replied the
agreeable husband.

"But is she in love with you?"
The admirer lowered his eyes, and, in humble boldness, said softly,
"I believe so." 
"I see! That changes things. I shall send for your
post-horses. Good day." The plows
that we use rise automatically when they reach a stump and come back down afterwards. I think
that Mr. Wells' mental facilities have a similar device for navigating the pitfalls of theology.

III
New Myths for Old
Before questioning the characteristics and practices of the Invisible
King, let's look a bit closer into whether God is separate from man
and is a God that can be comprehended.

Mr. Wells must not decide that this is not a test: that he assures an objective truth is real,
like the Nelson Column or the Atlantic Ocean, whether we can prove it or not. Though he does not use
the word "pragmatism", his practices are in fact pragmatist. He doesn't offer any evidence
for the existence of God, except that it is a guess which he finds
to work well.

Satisfaction is the only thing in the test that matters. So we must ask whether rejecting the
deity, and concentrating on the hypothesis of a fallible God, completely
different from the infallible, can make us feel any better about how
the universe works.

I guess that this is the substance of religion.
It isn't ironic in the least that I started this work by conveying the devout interest which I
display in learning that Mr. Wells was setting out on a journey for God. The unarguable agnosticism
which claims it isn't possible to know anything about how the universe
is irrational as other dogmas are.

Mr. Wells actually disowns that dogma. He says : "It may be that minds will presently appear
among us of such a quality that the face of that Unknown will not be altogether hidden" (p. 108).
Again he says "our God, the Captain of Mankind," may one day enable
us to "pierce the black wrappings," or to understand God.

This means that it isn't off that man's unquenchable thirst for knowledge of God in the non-Wellsian
sense of the term. God is just the answer to the mystery of life; and though the answer has not
actually solved any of these riddles, that doesn't mean that the answer does not exist outside
of the grasp of human understanding. This embodies a bit of hope at the news that an intellectual
is attempting to solve this problem. It is entirely possible, though unlikely that this will help
us on that path. One goes back to the previous analogy of flying. We always say over and over
that it is impossible.

When we wanted to say that something was impossible, we'd say that we couldn't do it any better
than we could fly. But now we CAN fly! We can fly like birds and we do so every day.
It serves then, that we shouldn't be down about trying to advance our understanding of the
universe. And it is sure that Mr. Wells' God would probably satisfy this need of the human
mind if it wasn't obvious that he had given it up as a bad job.

Is he outside of that network, being a God that made himself? This makes him the ultimate miracle,
a question imposed on the first one. If he abides by universal rules, he might finally be
understood. The legends of the creation of Gods are always weird but this is because they are
folk-tales. If God isn't a story, surely his relation to a creator
might be obvious.

Mr. Wells suggests that this might be because he flat out doesn't know. In that case, our current
God is close to ancient ones whose worst characteristic was that they only knew what their
worshipers knew.

Zoological Society. I have always considered it a fantasy, the breasts
of a Moorish woman, from what I've been told. But now I am convinced of my error. I have seen one
of these Moorish women, teased by one of her own kids.

They threw one of her breasts with such force that it almost reached the ground.
Her son could barely walk, but his mother still prepares his food
and serves it to him before she herself has been served. The "black-faced Clifford," who sullied
the glory which he acquired by his courtesy at the action of Sandal, by murdering his youthful
captive the Earl of Town, in unheated slaying, at the conclusion of it, has gained a passport
to an odious immortality from the soaring gift of the embellish of County. But his factual happening
is far many striking, both in a virtuous and in a poetical point of orientation, than that
allotted to him by our outstanding playwright. On the daytime before the try of Towton Field,
and after the ending of the skirmish which preceded it, an unexplored
bowman shooter him in the throat, as he was putting off his gorget,
and so penalise the uncomfortable victims, whose execution he had
pour equivalent element upon Wakefield Construction.

The retribution of the Yorkists  was not, notwithstanding, satiated by the end of the Butcher,
as Leland informs us that they titled him:--for they attainted him, in the early gathering of
the dominion of Edward the Ordinal, and acknowledged his estates, a few period afterwards, to
the Duke of Metropolis, who preserved them in his chain grasp deedbox
he forfeited them with his award and animation at the endeavor of
Bosworth.

The history of his son is a relationship fit prefabricated. One of the archetypical acts of
Rhetorician the Seventh, after his attainment to the throne, was to occurrence the cancellation
which had been passed against his theologian; and instantly afterwards
the actress lord emerged from the hiding approximate, where he had
been brought up in ignorance of his  judge, and with the manners
and breeding of a plain sheepman.

His son, who was the prototypal Earl of General, embittered the subdivision of his period, by embarking
in a periodical of adventures, which, in spite of their licentiousness, or rather in termination
of it, possess a real fresh impractical powerfulness. Judgement that his dysphemism was either
involuntary or unable to furnish him with funds to affirm his immoderate disorder and luxuriousness,
he became the leader of a stria of outlaws, and, by their agency,
levied aids and benevolences upon the assorted travellers on the competitor's
road.

A accolade of the old baronage, his father, which, by the by, is not the  award of an uneducated
man, is soothe surviving, in which he complains in real whirling cost of his son's abasement
and activity. The vulnerable reprobate, desire to gain his parent cognise from experience
the affect of existence scantily supplied with money, enjoined his tenantry in Fearful not
to pay their rents, and stroke one of them, Rhetorician Popely, who ventured to disobey him,
so seriously with his own paw, that he lay for a yearlong  abstraction in danger of demise.
He stale his fatherhood's houses, &c. "feloniously took gone his
fitting goods," as the old lord quaintly observes, "apparelling himself
and his sawbuck, all the indication, in textile of yellowness and
goldworker's energy, author like a duke than a indigent magnate's
son."

He likewise took a peculiar shunning to the interfaith orders, "shamefully licking their tenants
and servants, in such advised as some healthy towns were inclined to reserve the churches both
period and day, and durst not amount at their own houses."--Whilst intermeshed in these meanspirited
practices, little unharmonious, notwithstanding, to the manners of
his age than to those of our's, he wooed, and won, and united, a daughter
of the Author of Northumberland; and it is conjectured, upon really
credible grounds, that his entreaty and union with a muhammedan
of the maximal personnel under such disadvantages on his move, gave
increase to the attractive old ballad of the Nutbrown Housemaid.

 Weeds never stop growing. The Earth is filled
with seeds, and stirring guides them to the warmth of the sun where they grow. Winter herbs will
grow at any time, save extreme frost. In Winter, young trees and herbs will carry less snow and
your alleys will be clean.

Drifts of snow will allow deer and rabbits and other pests over your shrubs and walls and into
your orchard. When summer comes, the gardener must dress the hedges and walls, tend to the bees,
roses, and other plants. As the Summer fruit ripens you will wish to pick it. The gardener must
have help in his endless work because no one man can tend to all
of these things.

A gardener that will work quietly and patiently in your orchard will be rewarded with joy and
God will make the rain fall upon their trees. He will provoke your love and earn his wages. He
should be rewarded with what fruits and vegetables you have remaining to augment his wages.

If you cannot or will not hire a gardener you will keep all of the wages of the garden but
you will do all of the work. I have performed this work and gathered these rules for the good
of my countrymen.

Regarding soil
Some fruit trees common to our land include Apples, Pears, Cherries, Filberds, red and white
Plums, Damsons, and Bulles. We should not bother with Apricots, peaches, or Quinces, as they
do not suit our northern climate unless they are aided by reflecting the sun. We should avoid berry
bushes, such as Barberies, Goose Berries, Raspberries. All require
a well tempered soil to allow for best growth.

His catalouge of Swift's vices was far more interesting than that of our preacheand the gossip
he told was far more malicious and detailed.It was clear there was nothing Swift could do to please
all of his readers.If their hostile reactions meant anything, thethat the political connections
and high-church sympathies prevented him many of his contemporaries from reacting to the virtues
of Gulliver's Travels, and that to the contrary, his main work was checked for evidence of suspected
author's impeity and partisan.
This hostility presisted into the eighteenth century and can be seen in the ancedote told in the
1780's by the son of "Great Man"

Horace Walpole and was highly praised in the book Letter from a Clergyman.
Though a good writer Swift had a bad heart.Up to the end he was devoured by ambition.After finding
his opposition to the clergy fruitless it galled him more, contemned, he wrote up a resolution
to wait for Sir Robert Walpole. Sir Walpole noticed Swift looked sick and inquired the condition
of his health, with usual English humour. They were near a window overlooking the courtyard
where an old ivy dropping near the ground.Swift replied," Sir, I am like that ivy. I want support."
Sir Robert then said," Why did you attach yourself to the falling wall? Swift turned and went to
bed.
NOTES TO INTRODUCTION

1.In Intelligencer,No.111(1728) Swift defended Gay's satire of the "great Man",(1728) The Beggar's
Opera, and continued his offense to Sir Robert Walpole.Here it should be mentioned that in the
apology for irony used by persecuted dissenters.r Anthony Collins remarked that "High Church"
overlooked Swift's attempt at "dolling up Christianity" and wouldn't
punish him because of "Drollery Upon the Wings, Dissenters and War
with France." The boats all around saluted him and the crowd that was there when he disembarked
called out to him in the same way.

Birds in cages were released along his path by the Iazzaroni to show
how happy they were to see him.

 At one table, sat
a lieutenant of Uhlans with his girlfriend of the moment, and at another table sat a happy
older flirting man waving at a blushing chorus girl from the Theater des Westerns, and she in
return sends him a looser flirting nod.

At another table (one table away from the table with two prostitutes quickly eating with their
hands a large leg of English roast beef with German garnishes) sat a family man with his family.
At still another table sat another family man with his family. Don Jose's bedroom was dark, the shutters were closed air-tight. He
lay on his bed, made of wrought iron and adorned with fancy bedding and clean mosquito netting.
A silk scarf was wrapped around his head.
We find Don Jose in a bedroom darkened by the necessary closing of the shutters, there being no
other way of excluding the air. The bedsteads are of gilded iron, with luxurious bedding and
spotless mosquito-nettings. His head is tied up with a silk handkerchief.
 The Lieutenant-governor "ordered" an end to Roulette at Heligoland. I understand
it is still going on, but on a smaller scale without interruption. This was in response to
an enraged letter printed in the "Times" asserting descration to the English name and flag
by someone who lost seven-and-sixpence. 

A positive polarity arises from edges and angles.Very sensitive crystals response with only a short exposure

 Although my grandmother was the only daughter of a farmer, his parents were very
comfortable on his own line of life, and always helped my grandfather with money, but the
truth is he married outside of its kind, it always seemed likely
that the marriage may have existed some relationship to the total
expenditure and permanent estrangement between Gilbert Hamerton and
his brother, the squire of Hellifield Peel.

"When did this happen?"
"I can not remember: It was shortly after we saved the show.

"Poor Ned!" , I muttered.
"You pity the poor Ned," she said, sobbing now, "but you have no compassion for the poor do not
I have, and I am very unhappy."
"Come on, do not cry, Eva," I said what my arm around her, it was
very dark in that corner, and I knew that Eva does not bother us not
like a certain other person whom he long ago.

"What can I do for you, my dear Ned again, I might say and do," Will I
"No, no, he's so angry, and wished that I fear him. It was a very bad mood when he left me in the
night"
"But because he loved you, Eva."
"When people tell me how, I do not think they are uncomfortable. I
want to offend anyone if I loved her"

"You are a sweet, lovable, charming little lady are doing it, I know."
"But I did not want to marry Mr. Todd," she said, sobbing, while on my shoulder.
"Oh, Charley, what can I do?"
Could I have a beautiful, delicate, sweet wife and daughter in my arms now?
My idea of loving wife has changed in two weeks, and the behavior of Miss Blanche, which neither
see nor speak, nor what I was here this morning confirmed my belief
that women are better with a number on the heart.

Was it not surprising that I decided on the spot to answer the question of Eva: "Charley, what
shall I do" by the words "Marry me, my love? It is the only way I left you see out of nothing,
as my determination was fixed, I have not heard in a different time in no time, Eva's eyes. three

"Miss Eva, you do not have to ask
Mr Todd a lesson for him?" I do not think he knows how. A deplorable
state of ignorance! Said another.  
A group of happy soon joined
them, and I would have no chance tonight. But I was in my room because
I knew I was gone the next morning. Eva loved me, his mother said
when I heard it, in the pavilion on the hill, and I knew that would
not like my Aunt Stunner that my income exceeded Todd. In an armchair
by the open window, I thought about my decision and I a happy man.
In the midst of this reverie the door open with a bang, money and

governments did not begin by arbitrary authority, which is but the corruption and extremity
of government, and inevitably brings it back to the rule by the most powerful, against which governments
were conceived as the remedy, but even that, allowing they had conceived
in this manner, such authority being illegal in and of itself would
not have served as a basis for the rights of society, nor of course
to the inequity of institution.

 Trials were undertaken by a French
perfume manufacturer to develop an estate in the south of France, of plants that were collected
from the stems of mother plants grown in England.
Eventually the growing plants restrained to their earlier condition - even in their own native land
and circumstances. We take rest on
the lawn for sometimes, when the children are eating their cakes and enjoying the sound of the
mill that is on the opposite side. The glittering waters recede down the sides of the dark mountain
into the ravine. The boulders shaped like the caves looks all alike and lead to the innermost
part of a small lake, where nobody has yet reached. These lake and the stalactite caves is
visible only during particular seasons of the year and that too with little difficult.
The river Seille coming down from the cleft is tiny but the valley through which passes is very lovely
and fertile. The valley in the mountain expands as we move along, and it has greenish pastures
all along the way where men and women who take care of the cows and goats of various colors, explore
the forests with thick trees, by attaching themselves to the rocky
surface, just like a fly clinging on to a ceiling.

When we go along the valley for half a mile, it takes us to the village of Baume, and the
place where the rock comes to an end appears wonderful with the natural fortifications of cliff.
We cannot find a more fine scenery in Jura and so far I have seen, it is very strange of its
type. The valley that winds narrowly appears in golden green bearing a contrast to the rough
nobility of its surroundings.
This building was an important one, years back when it was the Abbey
of Baume and it now has become a farm house; still there is some majesty
in it to speak of its grandeur, (Footnot: For more details, refer
to Rousselâs "Dictionnaire de Franche-Comte".

It contains many volumes and like any other work on Franche-Comte, it may be utilized from the
public library of Lons-le-Saunier without any trouble) which could not be attributed to anyone
without knowing its ancestors. Church lies next to the Abbey with atleast one chef-d'oeuvre in
its retable.
The altar is made of a piece of wood which looks as though it belongs to the fifteenth century,
and it is in the shape of triptych, with enriched wings painted excellently. The inner portion
of it is segmented into six portion depicting scenes from the life and passion of Christ. It
has various figures which are sculptured finely and are covered with gold. The walls of the Church
are decorated by other paintings done by the same artist.

The tomb of abbe of Baume appears beautiful and was decorated with the seven small statuettes of monks
occupying the market of the middle ages. These figures has a fine expression and touching attitude
that would reach any heart. The causalities and roughness of the modern age has made the church,
lose its beauty.
The objects belonging to the pre-historic era and the ancient periods of French history could
be seen at Baume.

These include the weapons and ornaments made of bronze, Gallo-Roman relics, tombs, statuettes,
&c., and one could see the marking of a Roman camp which was the largest in the Jura, along
the summit of the rocks. This was said to protect the road from Lyons to the Rhine and was found
to occupy the height known as Mount Sermus.
Baume has the remnants of many historical edifices belonging to the iconoclastic period of the
French Revolution and when we analyze them on the whole, we would
doubt if anything was left because all those wealth were totally ruined.
 

The Jews were looking for the Messiah: the Romans thought of Vespasian.  THE END OF THE REBELLION
OF GERMANY
After the severe setback in Trier [518] Civilis recruited his army from 14 in Germany, and pitched his
camp near Vetera. The position was safe, and hopes to encourage his troops native to the memory
of past victories there.

[519 Cerialis] followed suit, with forces now doubled with the arrival of the Second, [520]
Thirteenth and fourteenth legions, besides auxiliary troops, both on foot and on horseback, [521]
he had received much of its summons and came running at the news of victory. General or dilatory,
but a vast plain stretched between them.

It was by swampy nature, and Civilis had built a dam that is projected towards the Rhine, which
the current and flooded the adjacent fields.

The treacherous nature of the land, where the shallow waters were hard to find, said against our
men, who were heavily armed and afraid of swimming.

The Germans, on the other hand, used the rivers, lightly armed, and tall enough to keep their heads
above water.
Provoked by the Batavian, the bravest of our soldiers opened participation
while 15, but soon fell into a panic when their arms and horses began
to sink deep in the swamps.

The Germans, who knew the fords, came leaping through them, often leaving our front alone and
running from side to side or backwards. It was a commitment by infantry, but more as a naval
battle. The men broke into the water or, as the fulcrum to find the company, strove with all
his might for the possession of it.

Thus, injured and all those who could swim and those who could not, fought desperately with
each other, killing all alike. However, bearing in mind the confusion, our loss was lower
than might be expected, for the Germans, not daring to venture out of the swamp, they retreated
to their camp. The result of this commitment gave each one of the generals a different reason to
speed in a decisive battle. Civilis wanted to continue with its success, Cerialis to end his
misery. The success encouraged the pride of the Germans, the Romans delighted with shame. The
natives spent the night singing out loud, while our men muttered angry threats.
At dawn Cerialis formed their cavalry and 16 auxiliary cohorts in
front, with the legions behind them, while he himself has maintained
a body got in reserve for emergencies.

Civilis did not open his line, but stopped in columns, [522] with the Batavian and Cugerni [523]
to his right, and the forces of all the [Rin 524] near the river on the left. General not followed
the custom of haranguing the army.

They rode along and went to their different divisions, in turn. Cerialis spoke of the former
glory of the Roman name and all its old and new victories. He urged them to erase forever the
enemy traitor and a coward who had already defeated. They had to
fight not to punish them. When all the fish is hence
coordinated in the mould, decant the jelly in very carefully, a tablespoonful at a time, in rank not
to perturb the solid material. Let the mould stand in chilled water for seven or eight hours,
when it can be turned out. Ornament with parsley, lemon, and beetroot.

LITTLE DISHES OF MEAT.
***
In this phase some practical and low-cost containers are bestowed,
which will perform either as wakeup food performing containers, entrÃ©es,
or for invalids, and which may, in the hands of an educated prepare
food servings, perform as types for more others.

As will be observed, it is not so much a query of expenditure to
give these little tasty containers as of management.

In all the following recipes for little containers of mutton, it will be encountered a many
superiority to use New Zealand Meat.
A good prepare food servings will not ever be humiliated by having too much chilled red meat on hand,
because she will be competent by her talent so to change the containers
that the appetites of those for who she caters will not ever get fatigued
of it.

Even a tiny portion of the loin of mutton may be performed in half-a-dozen divergent ways, and
be relished by those who are fatigued of the mutton-chop or the basic roast.
MUTTON CUTLETS.
Taken from the neck, mutton cutlets are highly charge, but those from the loin will be encountered
not only appropriate, but to reply well at a slighter cost.
First get clear of the under-cut or fillet from about two pounds of the best end of a loin of
mutton, slice off the flap, which will be practical for stewing, and it is principally good
devoured chilled, and then get clear of the red meat from the hard
elements in one portion, which pull apart with the fillet into cutlets
about half-an-inch thick.

Egg them over and fall them in well-seasoned bread-crumbs, grill them until a good earth colour
sheltering, and perform with gravy made from the hard elements and an onion.
This way of preparing food servings the loin is much more economical than in chops, because with
them the hard elements and flap are squandered, where in cutlets all is employed up.
To stew the flap, put it in a stewpan, the fat heading down, sprinkle pepper and brackish, and
slice an onion or two over, and set it to grill carefully in its own fat for an hour.
 

His paycheck would be a shilling short, thanks to the 'sub' from earlier this week.

Those seventeen shillings had to go a long way. Seven shillings for the rent, that meant the
left. One and threepence for a weeks worth of bread. Another one and two, thanks to the boy who saw
them buying a pint of milk every day. Next was one and eight, which went to paying off the
hundredweight of coal that they had bought with credit. Luckily, the Christmas Club money meant
they wouldn't need to worry about groceries for a week.

Fivepence three-farthings had to go to replacing Frankie's stockings that were now to far gone
to repair. If they had a little extra, they could buy a pair that would last three or four
times as long, but unfortunately that wasn't an option.

Same for the coal, if they had had more money, they could have bought a tone instead of by the
hundredweight and saved a lot of money, but that would have meant
having twenty-six shillings to spend on coal. With the lowest income,
the working class are forced to buy everything at its most expensive
price. This is how they are robbed. He is often clothed in a greenish-gray
uniform and his facial express often exhibits the sincerity of harsh times. He resides in
a small brick house that is similar to those one would cheaply rent in London.
 You will never be filled
with distaste by the habit of alternating between these two thrones.
A rhinoceros was admired by people in Paris some years ago. If there happened to be ten thousand
rhinoceroses in one territory, they would be ran after only to be
killed.

However if there were a hundred thousand women of beauty men would run after them also, just
to honour them.
REASON
During the time when Law was controller-general, and the entirety
of France was angry at Law's system, a wonderful unit of a man came
to him who was always correct, and logic was always in his midst.He
said to Law: 
"Sir you happen to be the biggest scoundrel, the biggest
idiot, the biggest crazy man who has come before us yet; let me tell
you how I will prove it.

In your imagination you think that with paper a state's riches can be multiplied tenfold; however this
paper is only a representation of actual wealth, the land and industry products,in the beginning
you should have gave us ten times more canvas, fabric, corn, wine, etc. That is not sufficient,
you must be positive of your market.

Instead you produce ten times the amount of notes that we posess of silver and substance, thus showing
that you are indeed ten times more excessive, or foolish, or more of a scoundrel, than any of
your predecessors. This is how my point it proved.
He was sent to Saint-Lazare shortly after he began to state his point.

Upon leaving Saint-Lazare, where he gained much study and built his reason even more, to Rome he went;
he requested to see the Pope, on the condition that his speech not be interrupted;and to the
Pope he spoke this:
"Holy Father, an antichrist you are and I will prove this so to your
Holiness. A man who does the opposite that Christ commanded and did
I call an antichrist. The
third amongst passionate and affectionate, and is towards bee moderated and corrected.
The former is the meere vizor of zeale, glancing asquint one distance
and tending another; pretending God and his glory, intending a number
of confidential and sinister end; former, either of honour and promotion,
as Jehu, whom marched furiously, and his word was the Lord of hosts,
but his project was the kingdome.

The young man was Michael Aynsworth.of university collage.oxford afterwards
vicar of Cornhampton,in Hampshire ,and master of the free school there
.

He was native of Dorset shire; his father,who as in narrow circumstances, living near Wimborne
st. Giles's the seat of lord shaftesbury ,by whom the son seems two have been nobly patronised,on
account of his inclination to learning and virtuous disposition.
The published letters are only ten in number,but have and accurate
manuscript transcript of fifteen,made from the originals by R. Flexman
(who had been a pupil of Ayasworth) in 1768. the transcriber's account
is as follows:- 
"After Mr.Aynsworth's death ,these letters remained
in the possession of his daughter and at here decease passed into
the the hands of the Rev.Mr. Upton,the then vicar of cornhampton;
by him they were lent to my brother John Baker,of grove place,Hampshire,
who lent them to me.it will be perceived that the ten printed letters
are not given as they were written, every thing of a private nature
being omitted,and passages only given of other letters,just as the
editor judged proper"

R.Flexman has made sum remarks illustrative of the letters at the end of his transcript, and added
sum particulars relating to Lord shaftesbury
 

Phil replied to himself, "Dear me, and still it's so low and flat, now. Lower than the canals."

"It is nothing much in comparison to some places.

We Netherlanders work hard to save the country that we made with our own hands.
Every street and garden of Rotterdam, and other towns towns also sink lower and lower, but we
are accustomed to that.
We do not stop because of caring, but go to work creating more steps
up to the houses, so we can get in at our doors."

"I view you as wonderful," stated Phyllis.
"I have not accomplished very much myself," Cousin Robert answered modestly.
"But you would do so if required. I am confident that you are like the little boy who saw the
water trickle coming out of the dyke, and put his thumb-"
"Phil, if you mention that story I will ask Cousin Robert van Buren to go into a windmill and
murder you," I blurted over her shoulder.
"But I wouldn't mention that," said he. Oh yep, he really was sweet, my cousin Robert.
"There is a spot to intrigue an American," he managed to fling a sop
to me, nodding upward in a a vague manner at some roofs on the River
Maas.

"Have you ever heard of Oude Delftshaven, cousin? But I guess you have not."
"Yes, I have!" I burst out at him.

"I would not be a Knickerbocker descendant if I hadn't. Some Pilgrim Fathers (I'm not positive
whether they were fathers then or later on) set off for America from oude Delftshaven by boat on July
22, 1620."
(I did not feel it was required to explain that, Knickerbocker as I was, I had taken in this fact
only the other day in "reading up"

Holland.)
I was still more in favor of being reticent as to the freshness of
my knowledge when it seemed that Phil knew something of a poem by
Mrs. Hemans on the topic.

I could not permit my English stepsister to be better informed than I when it came to a country
which I already began to view as a sort of confiscated family estate that ought to have been
mine.
We were going quick now, so quick that tears came to my eyes as the sweet-scented breeze brushed
against my lashes.

"There is Schiedam," replied Robert, pointing out a town that stood darkly out of the green
plain. "You know, the renowned 'Geneva' is made there."
We had never known that Geneva was in liquid form, but it seemed that "Geneva" or "Hollands" and
gin were all alike; and Cousin Robert appeared almost taken back when I said it was decent,
with hot water and sugar, for a head cold.

I am not confident whether the little Schie is really an idyllic sream, or whether the glitz of
that azure day was upon it for me, but our first "waterway" appeared elegant, as we spun along through
the nation of wide horizons and a spellbinding atmosphere.
There were comely houses, with balconies screened with roses-cataracts
of roses, yellow, and pink, and white.

We flew by lawns like the lawns of England, and thick, dun patches of forest,w here the sun
rained gold. There were meadows of jumping red flame poppies among the wheat, that quenched
their fire in the silver river among the wheat,and quenched their
fire in the silver river of waving grain. There were other meadows,
similar that were green and sunshine shone where cows were being milked
into blue pails lined with scarlet; and there were bowery tea-gardens
separated into snug little arbors for two, where each swain could
beckon his nymph unseen by the next-door swain and nymph, though all
twosomes were in view from the river. 
"Now we are arriving at Delft,"
said Robert, long before the thought that we could be close to that
ancient town came into my head. "If Rudolph Brederode, who loans me
this car, were here, he could impart much about the history," my cousin
carried on, stating his comrade for the second time, as if proud. 

He headed south, where about mid-month, he happened upon a man by the name of Frances Asbury
near Dover Delaware.

A formal meeting was arranged whereby Coke brought up the concept
of a Methodist Church sponsored university.

Unknown to Coke, Asbury had already been approached by John Dickens four years earlier with a similar appeal,
a school similar to Wesley's school in Knightwood, England, and so Asbury submitted a request
with that goal in mind, located in North Carolina.

At the Christmas Conference in Baltimore in 1784, Coke pitched the university idea again, and
it was met with outstanding approval. Along with this endeavor came the formal founding of the
Methodist Church, as well as the maiden Methodist College, and the
appointment of both Coke and Asbury as Bishops. "You remember me,
your old doc?" said the white haired man looking at Andrew.
"Oh, hello. I'm happy to see you again, and especially now, when everything seems so strange
and overwhelming. Do you mind if I go with you, otherwise I will just have to go home, and
I'm not ready to do that yet."

"Sure. I'd enjoy some new company. You can tell me about you house on the way, I heard it was
a very fine home."
As the two men made their way along the dirt road, slowly catching up to the others, the doctor began
the conversation by saying he had always envied those with adventurous lives. His days began
and ended attending needs of others and the most excitement he ever
had was an occasional emergency (and these weren't really "fun") or
late night phone calls where he had to calm frightened fathers-to-be
as they relayed first symptoms of labor paings through confusing conversation
and unsurity.

"It must be wonderful to have such an eventful life as you," he said as he looked at Andrew. "You
know so many important people and travel to such far away and fantastic lands."
Andrew looked up to the heavens and realized it was the clearest and bluest sky he'd ever and then
wonderful why his mood was in such opposition to the beauty and peace that should be enveloping
him.

Out of the corner of his eye, he seen a man making his way up to him and the doc. This was the
bank teller. Andrew knew the teller visited the doc on many occasion, under the guise of a bad
hip, in order to procure lithium for his schezophrenic wife. Knowing the bank teller had endured
much due to her antics, Andrew was surprised to see him so calm and jovial, appearing as though
he had no worry in the world. "Now why can't I be like that?" he thought.
Little by little, Andrew began to take note of the others walking next to and behind him. Rather
than discussing his own toils and troubles, he made a comment questioning
the doc about them, one by one.

And one by one, the doc passed on tidbits of information for each individual. There was the daycare-giver
devoting herself to raising little ones as upstanding and honorable
members of the community, compelled to do so after being informed
that she herself was barren.

There was the nurse who dedicated half of her waking time to charity work, assisting those in
need usually by trekking to their homes instead of requiring they come into the clinic. There
was the priest who was teaching children to read, and sometimes their illiterate parents only to
find the families also required help to obtain food due to non-work or poor health, in order to thrive.
There was the daughter and granddaughter caring for a woman whom
the doc was 99.9% sure had alzehimers but the daughter would not let
him diagnose it officially because of the embarrassment the family
would suffer in their small town, and their was the man, once a writer,
who through a series of strokes lost his ability to pen and now, using
a cane to assist him as he toiled along, spread bits of gospel and
cheer to those who were lucky enough to cross his path--fortunate
enough to be blessed with a kind and loving word from him, which so
many needed to get through each of their little, struggling but hopeful
lives.

Deviations from the teeth.

Irregularities of the teeth can be caused by uneven wear of some teeth or have broken some teeth,
what can happen when the cattle pastures on sandy soil or worse. Molar teeth may also show, from
similar causes irregular wear, or a disease or malformation of the jaw. their edges may become
clear, or it may happen that a molar tooth was accidentally broken. This may also occur that
a supernumerary tooth developed in an unusual position, and that interfering with natural mastication
and regular feed.
Treatment .-- mouth can be examined by a hand grasping the animal language and partially withdraw
from the mouth, so as to expose the incisor and the molar teeth of inspection. When desired,
however, to examine the molar teeth with your fingers, so as to obtain
a better idea of their condition, an iron instrument which is used
to Balling like a horse should be put in the mouth, so to separate
the jaws and keep them apart while the examination is performed.

Any sharp edges must be eliminated by molar tooth rasp, as used for horses. A supernumerary tooth
that interferes with chewing or tooth is broken or loose should be removed. When performing such
operations is desirable to throw or cast, animals, and be sure the
head was held so as to enable the operator to do what is necessary
without difficulty.

 The New York Herald, by now, had become proficient at predicting the weather, so
they started sending advanced notices to England when a storm was about to hit. Several storms
hit in succession, and the English were wondering why the Herald was punishing them.
"That's crazy," said Jack.
The Professor acknowledged, "yes, but they think that there has been more nasty storms, fogs,
and rain since we started notifying them than there were when Providence
notified them. Some believe they can send us requests for nicer weather."
 

There are all kinds of forgeries of antique objects. Generally they are so well done that it will
be very difficult, even for an expert to make them out. A skilled forger gets orders to make copies
of famous pieces such objects of art and he can make a good living from such orders.
If you are interested in buying such ancient works of art make sure that you see the object in
good light. Never shop for them in establishments which are dark
and poorly lit.

When you are at an antique dealerâs establishment, do not show that you are a serious buyer. Ignore
attendants who try to interest you in some object or other.
After you have decided on what you wish to buy, close the deal quickly. Do not make an advance payment
or try to bring down the price by haggling.

If you like something, either buy it or leave it. It is so easy to gain a reputation as a haggler
if you bargain.
If you are in the countryside and come across an antique piece at a farm house, the best way to get
the farmer to sell it to you is to simply place the money you are willing to pay for it beside
the object that you wish to buy from him. This will usually do the trick because the farmer cannot
resist the temptation of handling the money.

Once he had taken the money in his hands the transaction is completed without wasting time
in bargaining.

A dealer in art works may not always be willing to tell you where he got the piece that you want to
buy. The best way to get to the truth about this will be to tell him that you are certain that
the piece came from such and such source. If that is not correct, the dealer will be only too
delighted to prove you wrong by telling you where he got it from.

If you are right in your guess, his respect for your knowledge will increase and he will not
try to deceive you.
Show yourself to be a fair-minded buyer, erring perhaps on the liberal
side.

This may cause you to spend a little more on your acquisitions, but you will save valuable time,
especially if you travel extensively to buy antique objects of value. When you have established
a reputation as a person who is not niggardly, you will find that dealers who specialize in
antiques will inform you when they get something that might be of interest to you.
You might wonder how one assesses the value of an antique object.

This takes some experience. Prices of such object change with time, as you well know. However,
you may use a certain rule of thumb when trying to fix prices for a variety of antique objects.
For example, the cost of bronze statuettes may be calculated by squaring its height and the number
you get will give you an estimate of its value in shillings. Cost of parchment will depend
on whether it has continuous text or accounts written on it, and will also depend on its size.
Cost of antique jewelry will naturally depend on its weight. Coins may be bought in bulk cheaply
and you can choose from the them the ones that are really worth keeping.
You could always consult the British Museum or other museums to
educate yourself in the art of evaluating an antique object. 

One fine day, my heart flew forth. I think that it is Jeanne whom has it. At night, when I arrive

This is creditable neither in errand-boy nor poet. Because it had no imagination, but it was
cold, the Metaphyical School failed. When Metaphysical poets and writers strayed from the path,
they did not do anything dainty as you would think. They shredded imagery with scissors. Because
of passionate spontaneity, Shelley was saved!

His thoughts burn through folds of expression. His mind explodes richness and you can see
through it all to the bare minimum. All that is left is the naked
words and poetry. Huxley instructs us to keep our mouths
shut! Well, that is grand. It correllates so wonderfully with free thought and free speech.

An evolutionist can be spreading himself about the preachers of religion knowing nothing in science,
while another is saying to the "leave science alone", while still another says "you can't rear
the building if you try; you don't know enough."
What a grand harmony. We theologians advocate that natural selection be present with such instructors
as thus advise us, and continue among them long enough to atleast reject the worst from the crowd
and give us a blessing in the form of survival of the fittest because
we would like to know our duties.

So much for liberalism and broad principles.
Monistic materialism, according to HÃ¦ckel, finds its primeval parent in a moneron - a creature of
one substance; a semialbuminous fluid.

On would find it very interesting to know just how all the different substances got in, in
order to get out, of all the creatures of this earth; for involution lies behind evolution.
Conversely, we theologians have "no right to be heard"? While Mr. HÃ¦ckel has set aside intuitive,
first truths; and as all axiomatic truths are of this class, perhaps it's wrong for us to bother
you with our logic.
Regardless, we can't avoid speaking our piece, because we are advocates
of free thought and free speech.

There was a time when life and organisms began to exist upon our planet. Where did they come
from? How did they come? The "high priest" of Germany, who says he's entitled to a hearing,
says they appeared by "spontaneous" generation they first appeared in the "Monera".
He says "Only such homogeneous organizations as are yet not differentiated
and are similar to the inorganic crystals in being homogeneously composed
of one single substance, could arise by spontaneous generation, and
could become the primeval parents of all other organisms."

This is HÃ¦ckel's seed of life.
Has it always existed? Are "moneron" and "eternal life germ" synonymous? Undoubtedly no. HÃ¦ckel
does not propose to advocate an idea like this, nor does Darwin.

Similarly do they doubt the idea of such "life-germs" existing continuously. "Life-germs" are
material organisms; they must be either alive or dead. We know that there was no period in all
of history when a "life-germ" would not be subject to death.
Spontaneous generation and the notion that "life-germs" always existed are mutually exlusive. They
additionally fly in the face of the doctrine that all life was borne
by God.

God, the eternal, invincible spirit. All Christians profess that there is no life without antecedent
life. Men preferring to deify "life-germs" are free to do so. We have no willingness to accept
a distinction without a difference, however.

Except for the sacrifice of our common sense. It's more rational to believe in an indefinite
intelligence as the source of the original "life-germ", of intelligence,
and of moral nature.  
Did life evolve all the forms of organic
life know to walk the face of the earth? The enduring "life-germ"
idea of materialistic philosophy is not conducive to the beliefs of
evolutionists.  
There exists only one gentleman, at the time of

The royal family gleefuly accepted the gift but didn'nt accept the offer.
All the male and female members of the Bonaparte family frequently

So, the circle and society of Madame de C---n was considered the 'haut ton' among the noble. 
In
the last february the son of Madame de P---t and Comte de P---t was baptized by Cardinal de
Belloy when Madame Joseph and Prince Louis Bonaparte stood as sponsors. Comte de P---t was a relative
of Madame de C---n from her husband's side and now an accompany.
Though the de P---t family lost all their properties during the revolution, the baptism was
celebrated with both glitter and glamor. About one hundred and fitly persons, who are from both
ci-devant nobles and ci-devant sans-culottes were entertained regardless
of their wealth and dignity.

The audacious behavior of Senator Villetard who teased and insulted the poor old Cardinal de Belloy
astonished me most. Villetard who was a journeyman barber before the revolution showed utter
disrespect with his irrational conversation.
Villetard was imprisoned for theft and in 1789 was released by a mob.

In 1791, the Jacobins deputed him to address in the capital to encourage the depositon of Louis
XVI. He was chosen as member of the National Convention in 1792, where he was regarded as a
close aide to the most saguinary and violent factions.
In December 1797, during the insurrection of Joseph Bonaparte at Rome and subsequently loosing
his sovereignty and liberty, Villetard was commmisioned by the Jacobin and aesthetical party of the Directory
to seize and carry off the Celebrated Madonna.
The incidence demonstrated his lack of genius and criminal mind.

The wooden deity of Holy Virgin with a black gown (Believed to be her own), three broken china
plates which the Roman faithful beleived to be used by her was presented by Villetard to the
Directory. The presentation accompanied a cruel demonstration and a blasphemous letter.
He passed the next night in Loretto, the chapel of Holy Virgin with two prostitutes in a outrageous
sacrilegous act.

On the following morning he placed a prostitue fully naked in the altar and directed all the members
of the chapel to prostrate themselves before her. This utterly shocking behavior caused the
dealth of fifteen ladies, two of them died instaneously. I wonder how barbarous a man would
be who bereaved the religious, the pious and tormented their reproach
of apostasy. It placed the good and virtue to knell down before the
guilt and infamy. So more power to you !

wife for a trip to Rhine in May that left her four children - one girl had died in Brussels, seven

In a letter to his brother, however, we find the darker side of the
image.

It reveals many things other than what is actually written down. In this, the only card that
Branwell as I can discover, and a written in childhood, it seems that the brother and sister
are available only under very confidential. Until then, in any case, the conduct Branwell had not awakened
any fear for their future, and the absence of any important place in the will of his aunt, was
clearly not due to misconduct.

Branwell was now under the same roof as her sister Anna, having obtained an appointment as guardian
of young Edmund Robinson at Thorp Green, near York, where Anne was governess. The letter is signed,
ending playfully with 'yours, and the initials follow a closing message to Anne on the same

about where Green and Cadbury's Works now are, remained until 1839.

The door of Deritend was removed in August 1828, the Ways of five to July 5, 1841, Small Heath,
Sparkbrook, Moseley on the road, and the Hagley Road were all "free'd" in 1851, sites Toll

Near the Ball Street end was the Old Bear Yard, the premises of a dealer in dogs, pigeons, rabbits

It finally put an end to the licit supplies of grain which those countries had been acquainted to
supply; which resulted in increase in their populations into already overcrowded Italy, and
requirement of food was increased in a country which had been victimised like their own, and,
evebthough not so rapidly, but still by similar means;[1] and it ended in abject wars, to the
most fraudulent time in the history of Rome, to the Empire, and to the endless series of consequences
in its train.

[Footnote 1: Despite the fact that various Italian states were conquered by Rome before Greece,
possibility is that no emphyteusis was employed in those states until after the year B.C. 146-between
that and B.C. 120]
After the Western Empire had evidently fallen below the Northern arms--that is to say, after five hundred
years later-- and not until then, the Roman Code amended the deadly administration of emphyteusis.
A law of the emperor Zenos (A.D.474-491) defined whatever had therefore been uncertain in
the nature and incidents of emphyteusis. From increase of rent and eviction the resident was
guaranteed--the property alienation by the state being held hence to affect the quit-rent
only--and finally he obtained full power to dispose of the land,
which in whatever hands it might be reamained open to the quit-rent.

 301.)  Just repeat the subject of Gray's Elegy to the observation that although his correspondents,
a hermit in Hampstead, and was, gave me a great deal of information, for which I thank you,
have not responded to any of my questions.

I never doubted as to the true reading of the third line of the second
stanza of Gray's elegy, but simply pointed out that in one place the
penultimate word was printed drony and other authorities buzz.

Concerning this point, I wanted to know was simply whether, in any good annotated edition of
the poem, it was noted that when Dodsley printed in his collection of poems, 1755, vol. iv., the epithet
applied to flight was not drony and buzz? I dare say the point has not gone unnoticed, but if it does,
the fact is simply worth watching.

Then, any question, is not entirely clear about the date of publication of the Collection of
Dodsley.

The Rev. J. Mitford, in his Aldine edition of Gray, says (p. xxxiii.) That the first three volumes
were published in 1752, while my copy of "second edition" is dated 1748. Is that the correct date,
or editions vary? If the second edition came out in 1748, which was the date of the first
edition?

I only put this last question because, like most people are aware, some poems of note originally
appeared in the collection of poems by Dodsley, and it is important to determine the true years ago
when he first arrived in the press .

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS OF MINORS.

Guns ZÃ¼ndnadel (vol. ii., P. 247 .).-- JARLTZBERG "Want to know when and by whom they were invented,
and its mechanism."
Mechanism to describe without diagrams is both tedious and difficult, but I will be happy to show
JARLTZBRG one in my possession, if he's going to favor a call - for
which I include my address, which had its office.

The principle is, the charge in the gap, and the cartridge containing the priming, which is
ignited by the action of a hammer against them. It is one of the worst of the many methods of
shipping in the breach, and the same principle was patented in England by AA Moser, a German,
for over ten years. (344)
He got the attention of our artillery department, and has been tested
in Woolwich.

The letter referred JARTZBERG, Berlin, September 11., Just shows the extreme ignorance of the
writer on such topics as the range that he mentions has nothing to do with the principle or mechanism
of the gun in question. It should also, before he expressed himself so forcefully, namely that
the extreme range of English percussion rifle is closer than one mile 150 yards (how far the
latter, he says, not to exceed) and there would been so surprised

Introduction

[The information for anyone curious about what the world thinks of it, no doubt, be recognized
as that - contained in the article below, deserves a few words of introduction. The data collected from
her on the subject of what has always been considered one of the darkest and stricter monitoring
of the mysteries of initiation into the occult - from the days of the Rishis, to the Theosophical
Society - came the author's knowledge in a way that appears to the ordinary course of Europeans
strange and supernatural.

He himself, however, we can assure the reader, is a more complete disbelief in the supernatural,
although he has learned a great deal to limit the capacity of the
natural as some do.

In addition, he has to make the following confession of his own belief. It will be apparent from
a careful reading of the facts, that if the matter was really as described herein, the author
can not be himself an expert of high degree, as the article in that case would never have been
written. Nor is it intended to be one. He is, or was it for some
years a humble Chela.

Therefore, contrary to what must be true also that in relation to the upper stages of the mystery
that can not have personal experience, but speaks of him only as an attentive observer left to their
own assumptions - and nothing else. It may, therefore, boldly, during, and yet, unfortunately its
too short stay with some followers, is the real experiment and observation to verify some of
the less momentous or emerging parties of course "." And, although it will be impossible for
him to give positive testimony as to what is beyond, he can still
mention that all their courses of study, training and experience,
long, serious and dangerous as it has been often leads the belief
that everything is really as stated, except for some details purposely
hidden.

For reasons that can not be explained to the public, may be unable or unwilling to use the secret
that has had access to. Still allows one to whom all reverential affection and gratitude is due
- his guru last - to disclose the benefit of Science and Man, and especially for the sake of
those who are brave enough to personally experience, the following surprising hidden methods
to prolong the life of a period far beyond the common] .-- GM

Probably one of the first considerations which move the mundane today to request the opening in
Theosophy is the belief or hope, that immediately on joining, some extraordinary advantage over
the rest of humanity is what gives the candidate. Some even think that the end result of their
initiation will perhaps be exemption of the solution is known as the common lot of mankind. The
traditions of "Elixir of Life," says he is in possession of Kabbalists and alchemists are still
appreciated by students of medieval occultism - in Europe. The allegory of the Ab-e Hyat or
water of life, is still recognized as fact by the degraded remnants of the Asiatic esoteric sects
ignorant of the real big secret.

The essence of "hot and burning," by which Zanoni renewed his existence,
still fires the imagination of modern visionaries as a possible future
scientific discovery.  
Theosophically, but the fact is clearly
stated to be true, as the named concepts of procedure that led to
the realization of the fact, known to be false. "These
truths will now help ease your suffering. But remember, my father was worse off than you, living
in exile and poverty. But knowing his true birthright sustained him, knowledge you have not had
until now." When the Prince told me this story, and of my lineage, my head began to spin.
I could not fully comprehend what I had learned.

 The Chickadee does not migrate in the North. Migrations
-- Late September, May

The Chickadee is a permanent resident in northern parts of the United States.

The jolly little chickadee is no "fair weather friend". In the intensity of the autumn equinoctial
storm the chickadee returns to the tops of trees of near by houses where, through the sunshine,
snow, and uproar of the entire winter, you may hear its cheery, irrepressible chickadee-dee-dee-dee
or day-day-day as it swings about the hanging cones of the evergreens.

It literally overflows with good spirits, and is never more contagiously gay than in the midst
of a winter snowstorm. The chickadee is so active, so pleasant and cheering; imagine how silent
the long northern winters would be without this lovable little neighbor?

The chickadee serves a more down-to-earth purpose, however, than bracing faint-hearted spirits.
"There is no bird that compares with the chickadee in destroying the female canker-worm moths
and their eggs," writes a well-known entomologist. This particular entomologist calculates this
as a chickadee destroys about 5,500 eggs in one day; it will eat 138,750 eggs in the twenty-five
days it takes the canker-worm moth to crawl up the trees. The moral to this little story of the chickadee
is that it pays to attract chickadees about your home by feeding them in winter. This is an
obvious fact.

Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, in her delightful and helpful book "Birdcraft," explains to us how
she makes a variety of a bird-hash made of finely minced raw meat waste, canary-seed, buckwheat,
and cracked oats, which can be scatters in a sheltered spot for all the winter birds. The manor
in which this bird-hash is consumed leaves no doubt about its popularity. A raw bone, hung
from an evergreen limb, gets equal appreciation.

As friendly as the chickadee is, Dr. Abbott declares the bird to be the tamest bird we have as
it prefers well-timbered districts, especially those areas with red-bud
trees, especially when it is time to nest.

The chickadee is quite often clever enough to leave the labor of hollowing out a nest in the tree-trunk
to the woodpecker or nuthatch, whose old homes the chickadee readily appropriates; or, when these
birds protest the invasion of their homes, a knot-hole or a hollow fence-rail answers every
purpose. Here, in the summer woods, when family cares plague the chickadee, a mournful, minor
whistle replaces the chickadee-dee-dee that Thoreau likens to "silver tinkling" as he was blessed
to have heard it on a frosty morning.

TUFTED TITMOUSE (Parus bicolor) Titmouse family

Called also: CRESTED TITMOUSE; CRESTED TOMTIT

Length -- 6 to 6. 5 inches. The tufted titmouse is about the size of the English sparrow. The crest
of both the male and female are high and pointed. Their coloring is gray or ash-gray above; darkest
on wings and tail. Frontlet, bill, and shoulders are black; the space between the eyes is gray.
The sides of the head are a dull white. The under parts are a light gray; the sides a yellowish,
tinged with red. Range â With the United States to the east of plains, and is only rarely seen as
far north as New England. Migration times are October.

April. This is also the winter residence of the tufted titmouse, but it can also be found throughout
the year in many States.

"A noisy titmouse is Jack Frost's trumpeter" is quite possibly one
of those few weather-wise proverbs with a grain of truth in them.

As the chickadee comes from the woods with the frost, so it may be noticed by his cousin, the
crested titmouse is more boisterous evidence throughout the winter.

One might sometimes think his whistle, is like that of a tugboat's,
which is worked by steam. Yet how the effects of nesting cares alone
can silence it in April! 

The Titmice will always see to it you are
not lonely as you walk through the woods. This lordly tomtit, with
his jaunty crest, keeps up a persistent whistle at you as he darts
from tree to tree, leading you deeper into the forest, calling out
"Here-here-here!', and looking like a pert and jaunty little blue
jay, without his gay clothes. Mr. Nehrling translates one of the calls
"Heedle-deedle-deedle-dee!" and another "Peto-peto-peto-daytee-daytee!"
Iit is at the former, sharply whistled as the crested titmouse gives
it, that every dog gives rise to his ears. 

Comparatively little
has been written about this bird, due to the fact the titmouse is
not often found in New England, where most of the bird litterateurs
have lived. According to this fact, it has more importance
with marriage alliance. Particularly it had been vigorously attached with marriage alliances especially
between members of royal houses.

Theses unions had been emphasized to the princess the office of mediatrix. In Beowulf, she is
called Freothowebbe, which is âthe peace-weaverâ. Usually queens will be having the high
position from this rose. In the matters of acts of foundation, decrees of councils, charters etc., they
will make their signatures. Sometimes they had been ruling their dynasty with full royal authority
as Seaxburg, the queen of the West Saxons, after the death of her
husband had been ruling in his dynasty.

As a matter of fact, from the date f the beginning of Christianity in England, usually the
women, particularly these royal women, had been very active in the rule and they had been
very adamant in furthering the faith as their men.
 Many drugs, like mercury, are readily absorbed by cattle through their
skin. As this makes poisoning easy, medicines given in this fashion are only for their local
effect, not the cattle's constitution. Peace is much desirable than war. The pains of a camp and war-zone
may seem great, but the sufferings of a constitution that is being violated, and separatist
rampant on the country, will be more devastating in nature. 

In any case when you viewed Oberan at His Majesty's, swaying gently in sylvan dress through what
was both a wood and looked like a wood (and as such kept your mind available to listen to him),you
found yourself able to trust in all the beautiful things he said; but upon seeing Mr. Barker's
Oberon stark and on his feet, resembling a solemn painting with red
eyebrows and yellow cheeks, against a background of symbolic painted
cloth, and informing you that he knows of a bank where the uncultivated
thyme blows, you are aware he knows nothing of the sort; and so you
do not believe any of it.

But leaving SHAKSPEARE out of this as is decent: I very much liked the golden dresses the fairies
wore, as long as Puck, who is a kind of grown-up Struwel-Puck and bothered me greatly, was
absent from the scene. Puck's loud scarlet suit matched only several vermillion eyebrows and ruined
the color scheme.

I was a fan of the uncomplicated and graceful chain-dances upon the green mound (note: these
are English dances and tunes, as opposed to Indian). Still, during the final scene, in which
they interweave themselves amidst the staring columns, I thought that their motions possessed
an absence of space. Yes, that was the problem throughout, that and the unsparing light that
flowed onto the stage from 12.6 points on the perimeter of the dress-circle.

There was a lack of distance, a lack of any sense of the spirit-world,
and a lack of mystery (with the exception of Mr. BARKER's intent).

  The scene about the haunt of Titania was
  the best. The Liberty curtains in the background were
  a clever touch, however, they seemed slightly
  arbitrary as symbols for the forest.
  I am not opposed to having indications
  of a forest if you are short on trees.

The indications might take the form of a few actual trees in tubs, or even just one, but somehow,
and this is probably more my fault than anything else, the image of drapes hanging did not convey
to me the idea of birds' nests.
 

he glanced longinly at the happy widow, but was interrupted before he could speak by shoppers. His face
was sad as he walked off, but before long it grew cheerful once more.
 The Lutherans, in the silence of night,
took arms and encamped, numbering three or four thousand, near the
river bank in the neighborhood of Saint Michael's cloister.

The Prince summoned for the administrators of all the foreign mercantile
organizations--Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Hanseatic.

He initiated their assistance for the defense of the municipality, and commanded them to remain
in their armor at their respective factories, ready to act at a moment's warning. It was agreed
that they should be informed frequently as to the progress of events.

Antwerp presented a fearful site on the morning of the fifteenth.

Three distinct armies were aligned at different points within its
walls.

The Calvinists, at fifteen thousand strong, waited in their camp
on the Mere; the Lutherans, armed and eagerly anticipating action,
were at St. Michael's; the Catholics and the regulars of the city
guard were posted on the square.

Between thirty-five and forty thousand men laid wait, according to
the most moderate calculations.

All parties were excited and eager for a skirmish. The consuming fires of religious hatred
burned fiercely in each chest. Many delinquents and outlaws, who had found refuge in the course
of recent events at Antwerp, were in the ranks of the Calvinists,
seemingly profaning a sacred cause, inspiring the fanatical party
with a bloody dedication.

Papists, once and forever, were to be hunted down, even as they had
been hunting the Reformers for years.

Let the men who had fattened on the spoils of plundered Christians
be dealt with in similar fashion.

Let their homes be destroyed, their bodies given to the dogs--such were the cries exclaimed by
thousands of armed men.

Similarly, the Lutherans, as angry and as rich as the Catholics, saw a murderer and a robber in
every Calvinist.

They thirsted after Calvinist blood for the spirit of its religious frenzy; the characteristic
of a century which only with difficulty may be comprehended in our
cold and sceptical age.

Certainly a bloody battle would be fought that day in the streets of Antwerp--a general engagement
during which, whoever was victorious, was sure to deliver it over
to fire, devastation, and carnage.

Such would have been the result, (according to the concurrent testimony of witnesses, as well
as contemporary historians of every country and creed), but for the courage and wisdom of one
man.

William of Orange knew the consequences of a battle, pent up within the walls of Antwerp.
He foresaw the horrible havoc which would accompany it, the desolation
which would be brought to every hearth in the metropolis.

"Never were men so desperate and so willing to fight," said Sir Thomas Gresham, who had been
expecting every hour his summons to share in the conflict.

If the Prince was unable to avert the impending calamity, no other
power under heaven could save Antwerp from demolition.

The articles prepared on the fourteenth were already approved by
those who represented the Catholic and Lutheran interests.

They were read early in the morning to the troops assembled on the
square and at St. Michael's, and received with good cheer.

It was now necessary that the Calvinists should accept them, else
the disagreement should be fought out at once.

At the stroke of ten o'clock, William of Orange, attended by his colleague Hoogstraaten, the
municipal authorities, and a hundred troopers, rode to the Mere.
 

With brimming eyes they sorrowfully spoke of his deeds and beauty.

Sacred word of prayer they spoke as the grieving mother and crying
children were given to God to seek solace.

This was the only source of strength in this time of sorrow and both
prayers and thanks for the joys of the past and wishes for a better
future were given.

The hymn. "Why should we grieve the dead or quiver at the thought
of death?"

This part was read and sung aloud.

Here the children are again, all in their home where they had lived
in the past, all except the son who has now passed on to a better
place.

But here they are now together in sorrow rather than joy. Times of happiness, times of sorrow,
these are the human experience of life here on earth.

The tiny village grave yard was not too far away. There, a grave awaited
for his arrival.

Just a week ago he lived and was healthy, looking forward to a bright
future and happiness to come.

Yet now we are gathered in the grave yard in sorrow.
"Ah, how would you have known, just that short while ago, this this
bright youth would be picked by death from amongst them all?"

"Whose strong arm bent Defiance in the battle? Who cried the loudest as victory was won?"
"Who had the strongest most generous heart, no one better than he?

Yet, it is him and not the others that we see lying here in death

" It's as heroic to explore new territories or to escavate cities as
it is to move with an army toward conquest.

Scientists will move bravely through marshes filled with snakes in order to count and name every

. Nonetheless, what you achieve and the way in which you achieve it
are bordering on dishonest, and are looked upon by others as such.

There is no doubt that this is caused by your youth, lack of planning
and also to some extent a lack of following through with a plan.

All related to being young and inexperienced.

"You are very aware of things around you and are drawn to things for
their aesthetics and intricacy, but you let your affect be bruised
on contact with anything rough, unrefined or objectionable.

This follows onto an inability to rub shoulders with the coarser, underbelly of society. There is
no doubt that these types often inadvertently cut you to the quick,
but it would be better for you if you learned how to just accept others
for who they are.

Stop getting into the rut of judging them and imagining that they
are judging you.

Most criticism is not meant personally and it should be received
as comment on the performance and not on the performer.

"Your business sense and your value of things commercial are not the best. I think there are many
reasons for this, but mainly you do not take in the complexities
of the financial world, seem reluctant to evaluate things in comparison
with each other and, indeed, have little knowledge of the absolute
values of things.

Accordingly, it must be conjectured that you are not now nor ever
will be interested in the business world.

If your needs were supplied and you had a career which took up your
attention money would hold no interest for you.

It would be to your own advantage to give some due to the place of
financial considerations in everyone's lives.

That being said, I am not advocating in any way that you should develope this personally as
a career.

However, we cannot all be bank managers.

"At this stage I think that you should focus on learning from things
done on a day to day basis.

I did mention above your impulsiveness.

It would be better if you slowed down, developed a plan, put it into
action and then followed it through thoroughly; and then lastly, made
observations about the whole scenario with appropiate notes and recommendations
for the future.

 When you said no and told me to come here for an explanation,
I was more than happy to wait. So tell me now Jen...why? There's
nothing holding you back now.

The stories about me, Johnnie.

And you know them all just as well I do.

Sternly but concerned, the young man exclaimed, "Stories! What stories? For as long as I can
remember, I've stricken down men who weren't smart enough to bite
they're tongues over anything bad pertaining to you!"

    
   "That may be true, Johnnie; but the women, God knows you won't
  lay a finger on them, and because of that, they're stories are all
       imagination with
   no room for truth."
       
    "So then whats left for them to say that hasn't left their lips yet? What...that
   if any guy tried to smooch you, He'd see someone else between
  the two of you? And lets be honest, Jen, you're not the run of the mill
  type of girl. you're different and they're all just jealous of that, And
       anyone who believes that
 pile of rubbish will never be good enough for you anyways. I swear,
  if you'd let me- and I'm not one to do so otherwise-
   I'd prove to you without a shadow of a doubt that not even the most preposterous
  of gossip would stand between you and I."
       

And with a look of utter lust, yet maintaining his bearing as if he'd already been given the
okay, took a step towards Jen while she almost immediately took one
back with hand raised to keep the distance.

"You know, Jen, I'm starting to think that you
  believe a good majority of those tall tales yourself."
  
	   "And if you grew up in my shoes, Johnnie, you'd be quick to understand
why too."

That's what I wanted to tell you tonight, and there's nothing for it, I'm afraid we must now go
our own ways. If all I'm good for is bringing you grief, just say the word, I'll go. It was
never my intention to complicate things, I know too well of the weight
it carries on your shoulders.

Words on soft, weak breaths barely escaping her mouth as she spoke
, as if the pain was constricting her airway like a snake coiling
tighter and tighter around her neck.

"you want the truth, Johnnie? I grew up in Yarn with my mother. she made a living sewing books
to be bound by another man.

What little money she made went to safe keeping. anyways, she was
always terrified of me traveling the wrong path, but she always kept
me straight.

Now this man who did the book binding..." she suddenly paused, and
now speaking in almost a whisper, " McGair was his name...Daniel McGair."

"You're

doing great, Jen, keep going."

" He was a thin man but easy on the eyes. And wore his religion like a badge of honor, I've
never seen him go to church though, but he had an opinion bout everything
on gods green earth.

He knew a great many things too.

He rarely ever spoke about himself, said it wouldn't be right for me to hear whats in his head.But
he did teach me to read, and mother loved watching us be.

From what I could see, he was a decent guy, but hear me out, if he
wanted something, there was no other option but him to have it, even
if it killed him. Well, I was close to 20 and he was about 40 at the
time, whenever I went out for anything or said something against his
liking, I'm telling you, he turned shades of white that porcelain
could only aspire to be. He'd shake like his feet were on a fault
line, and dare me to do anything I knew he wouldn't approve of. He
had brainwashed mother as well, had her thinking just like him. But
I held my sanity close. I cringe to think what would have been if
I wasn't as strong willed. Presuming again
that the article of his appointment to me was to annex the all-important
forms to get out a apparent for the right, I congratulated him aloft
his acceptable fortune, and was about to annex alternating with a
description of some of the abundant allowances that accept to appear
to the community, if he al of a sudden and somewhat uncivilly requested
me to "be silent," and accept to what he had to say.

He began with some accepted animadversion about the asperity of affluence
amidst mankind, and abstract himself as a arresting archetype of the
fate of those men, who, according to all the rules of right, care
to be abreast the top, instead of at the bottom of the ladder of fortune.

"But," said he, arising to his anxiety with abrupt energy, "I accept
now the agency at my command of ascent above to fate, or of inflicting
boundless ills aloft the accomplished animal race."

Looking at him added closely, I anticipation I could ascertain in
his eye the beam of madness; but I remained bashful and accessible
added developments.

But my scrutiny, baseborn as it was, had been detected, and he replied
at already to the announcement of my face: "No, sir; I am neither
bashed nor a maniac; I am in abysmal ardent in all that I say; and
I am absolutely prepared, by absolute experiment, to authenticate
above all agnosticism the accuracy of all I claim."

For the aboriginal time I noticed that he agitated a baby blend in
his hand; this he placed aloft the table, apart it, and took out two
or three baby volumes, a announcement or two, and a small, square,
wide-mouthed vial, hermetically sealed.

I watched him with abstruse curiosity, and took agenda of his aboriginal
movements.

Having abiding his books to clothing him, and placed the canteen
in a apparent position, he drew up his armchair actual carefully to
my own, and accurate in a half-hissing tone: "I appeal one actor dollars
for the capacity of that bottle; and you accept to accession it for
me in the city-limits of San Francisco aural one month, or scenes
too abhorrent even for the acuteness to conceive, will absolutely
be witnessed by every active animal getting on the face of the globe."

The tone, the manner, and the cool absurdity of the demand, aflame
a aside smile aloft my lips, which he observed, but disdained to notice.

My apperception was absolutely fabricated up that I had a bedlamite
to accord with, and I able to act accordingly.

But I absolute at already that my centermost thoughts were apprehend
by the arresting man afore me, and seemed to be advancing by him in
beforehand of their expression.

"Perhaps," said I, "Mr. Summerfield, you would bind me by allegorical
me absolutely of the area of your claim, and the attributes of your
discovery."

"That is the article of my visit," he replied.

"I affirmation to accept apparent the key which unlocks the basic
gases of water, and frees anniversary from the embrace of the other,
at a individual touch."

 Deities with broken or crippled legs are rebellious and supposedly
universally fell from heaven. This is the same theory of the devil's
broken leg during his fall. (luke 10:18). There are others who have
broken legs as well such as Vulcan, Loki, Hephaestos, and Wieland.
Some say the idea was derived from lightning flashes as they are crooked.
In a midiaeval German play, the devil's mother walks on crutches.
Lame feet also plagued Asmodeus, the Persian demon in Le Sage's book
Le Diable boiteax. Asmodeus seems to be limping and walks with sticks
for crutches. The rabbinical tradition tells us that the demon Asmodeus
broke his leg while hurrying to meet King Solomon. I had my long bath, and totally tired, I asked stumblingly, âHow
come you are in Brussels? What a hilarious meeting?â 
âWhy hilarious?â
questioned Joliet, in a surprising tone, which continued as he spoke.
âThe purpose of my visit is to give away my daughter in marriage.
All arrangements are made, we expect your arrival for the wedding;
the contract is written out by the lawyer; and breakfast is getting
ready at the best restaurant here.â 
âOh my dear Joliet, it
is Francineâs wedding!â I exclaimed.
