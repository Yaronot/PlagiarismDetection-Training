When we got back to college it was past five o'clock, and between us we managed to find everything
that was necessary for tea.  I had a fire in my room, but Murray had not one in his; he had
tea-cups, but I had none; while I had things to eat, which our cook at home had declared would

  "If anything ever pleases you, tell us what it is."

"My greatest pleasure is in polite conversation," he answered.

"Oh, you are a sarcastic idiot," I retorted, for people who are afflicted by thinking themselves
funny when I think they are idiotic always make me rude.

"Dennison never says what he means," Ward explained, "it is a little habit of his."

"Why can't you talk straight, it's much simpler, and doesn't make me feel so horribly uncomfortable?"
I asked, turning to Dennison.

"Marten is getting angry," was the only answer I received, and it was so near the truth that
I wanted to pick him up and drop him in the passage.

Ward, however, calmed my feelings by saying that he could not imagine any one troubling to
be angry with Dennison.  "The one thing he prides himself on is getting a rise out of people,
and we aren't such fools as he thinks us."

"And he is a much bigger fool than he thinks," Collier said solemnly.

"You are a nice complimentary lot," Dennison remarked, smiling amiably upon us.

"It's your own fault," Collier continued; "you try to be clever and succeed in being confoundedly
dull.  I was at school with him for five years and I know his only strong point is that the
more you abuse him the more he likes you."

"I'm fairly in love with you, Coalheaver," Dennison said.

"Naturally, but you might forget that very witty name."

"I'm going," Lambert declared, "for I'm dining in hall, and if I don't go for a walk those
kromeskis and quenelles will choke me."

"Half a minute," and Ward pushed Lambert back into his seat; "now we are all here, I think
we had better arrange a freshers' wine.  There always is one, and nobody will get it up if
we don't, so I vote we do the thing properly."

Every one seemed to approve of the idea, but as I was no use at making arrangements I suggested
that Ward should manage the whole business.

"I can order everything, but we must have a committee to choose the people we shall ask and
all that part of it.  We can't ask everybody," Ward said.

"Half of them won't come if we do.  I should think we had better ask the whole lot, and then
we shall know what they are made of," Lambert advised.

"We shan't have a room big enough to hold them," Collier said.

After that we all began to talk, and though I had only a hazy notion of what we decided, I
heard enough to know that Ward and Dennison meant having this wine in about ten days and only
intended to ask the freshers whom they liked.

CHAPTER IV

UNEXPECTED PEOPLE

The idea of working for Mr. Gilbert Edwardes never had much attraction for me, and for the
first two or three weeks at Oxford I found it very difficult to satisfy him.  However, the
excuse that I took a long time to settle down in a fresh place did not seem as reasonable to
him as it did to me, so I had to abandon it and try to appease him.  The worst of him was that
I never knew whether he was pleased or not; he accepted my most determined efforts at scholarship
as a matter of course and reserved his eloquence for the occasions on which my work showed
symptoms of haste.  In less than a fortnight I felt that my tutor and I were watching each
other, an element of distrust seemed to have sprung up; he took it for granted that I would
do as little as possible, while I was searching for something which could tell me that he was
human as well as learned.

I could not understand him in the least, for I had been accustomed to masters who talked about
things of which I knew a little even if they were bored by doing so; but when I met Mr. Edwardes
I felt that he belonged to the ice period, and that he would think the smallest thaw a waste
of time.

I do like a human being, I mean a man who lets you know something about him and does not barricade
himself against you.  But a man who puts up the shutters in front of his virtues and faults
bothers me most terribly, and I always seem to be bumping my head against something invisible
whenever I see him, which is a most disconcerting performance.

Mr. Edwardes was also Murray's tutor, but Murray was not afflicted, as I was, with the desire
to know people more than they wanted to be known, and he told me that if I would only take
Edwardes as I found him we should get on together splendidly.  In spite of Jack Ward, I saw
Murray every day, and the more I knew of him the more I liked him.  He was in my room one evening
after Ward had arranged that we were to have a freshers' wine, and I asked him if he was coming
to it.

"I can't go unless I am asked," he said, "and I shan't go now if I am asked."

I resolved to say a few things to Ward, but I did not know what to say to Murray.

"Ward is asking everybody he wants, isn't he?" he inquired.

"Yes it was left to him and Dennison, I believe."

"Then I am not likely to be invited, for he and I never could do anything but have rows with
each other at Wellingham."

"What about?" I asked, for Murray had never said much about Ward to me and I wanted to hear
his side of the quarrel.

"It isn't worth repeating," he answered.  "I was head of the school and Ward thought a friend
of his ought to have seen.  He thinks I am a smug because I have to work, and I suppose I think
he is a fool because he thinks I am a smug.  He is a queer sort, and it is hopeless for me
to try to be friends with him, even if I wanted to be, and I don't."

"He is a fairly good cricketer, isn't he?" I asked, for I had discovered that when Murray had
once made up his mind no efforts of mine would change it.

"Yes, he would have got into the XI. quite easily only he was so slack, and the master who
looked after our cricket couldn't stand him.  It was rather a swindle that he didn't get into
the team all the same."

"I hate slackers," I said, and to prove it I set to work on some Homer for Edwardes.  Murray
got his books and we slaved together for nearly two hours, when a most timid knock sounded
on my door, and a man came in who seemed to be most fearfully nervous.  He was carrying a gown
and a cap in his hand, and he looked at Murray, who was not at all an alarming sight, as if
he had encountered a wild man from one of those regions where wild men are bred.  I had never
had much practice at putting any one at their ease, for most people hit me on the back and
call me "old fellow" far too soon; but I tried very hard to calm my visitor, and though it
was six o'clock I asked him to have tea and every conceivable other thing I could think of,
all of which he refused.  He told me his name was Owen, but apart from that I knew nothing,
and the more he fidgeted with the tassel of his cap the more I wondered why he had come.

Murray, however, guessed that he was in the way and hurried off as soon as he could.  Then
Owen made two or three unsuccessful efforts to begin, until I felt that I must offer him something
more, only I had nothing left to offer.  The man who said that hospitality covers a multitude
of emotions went nearer the mark than most of those word-turning people do.  But at last it
all came out in jerks, and I felt most thoroughly sorry for him; if I had been in his place
I am certain I should never have faced such an ordeal.

"I didn't like to tell you why I had come before your friend," he began; and he still twisted
his cap round and round by the tassel.  "I suppose a sort of false modesty prevented me, but
I might just as well have spoken before him."

"Murray is a most awfully good sort," I said lamely, for I wanted to help him so much that
my head felt hot and I could not think.

"I expect he is," Owen went on, "but I haven't come to be friends with your friends.  I only
wanted to see you, and the reason is that over twenty years ago in India your father saved
my father's life."

I did feel relieved when he told me that, for I had been imagining that he was the kind of
man who is known as a freak, and had come to win me over to some stupid crank which he would
call a noble cause.

"I am most tremendously glad you have come," I said, and then I began talking about my father's
old regiment, and Owen could not get a word in until I had finished.

"You don't understand," he said, as soon as he got a chance; "when you talk about a regiment
you only think of the officers, my father was one of the men."

"I don't see what that matters as long as his life was saved."

"It does matter," Owen replied; "it matters here very much, where there is not much liberality
except in offering meals and things not wanted." I moved my feet and kicked the fender, the
fire-irons jangled together and he went on: "I ought not to have said that, it is my blundering
way to say the thing I oughtn't; what I meant was that Oxford is not very liberal to a man
like I am, who is here by hard work, and not because his fathers and grandfathers were here
before him.  It is impossible in a place of sets--social, athletic, and all the rest--for a
man who has to work to keep himself, to be treated in the same way as you, for instance, are
treated.  I am not what the world calls a gentleman."

"Oh, confound the world," I said, "it is always mixed up in my mind with the flesh and the
devil," and as Owen did not say anything for a minute I asked him what college he was at.

"I am unattached, St. Catherine's if you like; we are called 'The Toshers,'" he answered, and
there was a note of bitterness in his voice.  "Of course," he went on, "I am boring you to
death, but I must say that I should never have come to see you if my father had not made me
promise that I would.  He takes a tremendous interest in both your brother and you; he knows
the place your brother passed into Sandhurst and where he was in the list when he went out,
and last summer he watched for your name in The Sportsman, and when you got any wickets he
was as pleased as Punch.  He writes to Colonel Marten still."

I wished I could have said that my father had mentioned him to me, but if I had I am certain
that Owen would have seen that I was not telling the truth.  "My father," I tried to explain,
"never talks about anything he has done.  If your father had saved his life I should have heard
of it a hundred times."

"You have the knack of saying the right thing, I shall never get that if I live to be a hundred;"
and then he stood up, and putting a hand on the mantel-piece looked at the photographs of my
people, but he did not say what he thought about them.

"If I did say the right thing, it was a most fearful fluke," I said, for I could not be silent.
"I simply hate men who walk about patting themselves on the back because they have had what
they call success with a remark."

He did not listen to what I was saying, but stood staring into the fire; at last he turned
round and held out a hand to me.

"I must thank you," he began; "and there is one other thing I have got to ask you before I
say good-bye.  My father asked me to make you promise that you would never mention what I have
told you about his life being saved by your father, or anything about him.  It seems to be
a sort of compact, I don't understand it.  He doesn't want your people to know anything about
me, but only you."

I promised, of course, but I felt rather bothered.

"We may meet some day in the street," he said, and he pushed his hand into mine; but I let
it go, and told him to sit down again.  For this last speech of his was annoying, he had evidently
got a wrong idea of me.

"It is no use talking rot," I said.  "To begin with, what on earth have you got to thank me for?"

"If Colonel Marten hadn't saved my father's life, I should never have been born," he said.

"And you have come to thank me for that?" I said, and I did not mean to be rude.

"I was told to, you see," he answered.

I looked at him and we both laughed, though I went on laughing long after he had stopped. 
The idea of me being thanked for anybody's existence was beautifully comic.

"It is very good of you to have come," I said, as soon as I could; "but I don't deserve any
thanks and you know that I don't."

"You haven't got much to do with it, perhaps, but you were here and I should never have been
forgiven if I hadn't come to see you.  I shan't come again."

"Oh, bosh," I replied.  "What's the good of talking stuff like that? Of course you will come
again, and I am coming to see you, if I may. How long have you been up here?"

"This is the beginning of my third year."

"What did you get in Mods?" I asked, for I felt sure that he had done well.

"A First," he answered.

"I wish I had.  Where do you live?"

"I shan't tell you."

"You may just as well, for I shall easily find out."

He stood up again, and talked as he strode up and down my room.

"I have been here two years," he began, "and I know that it is impossible for us to be friends;
and when you have thought it over you will think as I do. I did wear't. if about element of out my

  He knew, as you call it."  I did not feel that my tale, though
it had the merit of being true, was a good one.

"It is no use for you to sit there and conjure up tragedies," Ward replied.  "I can't help
gambling, it is in my blood; my father is about the biggest speculator in England.  If you
want a good tip, buy Susquehambo Consolidated Rubies."

I was not inclined to buy anything except a fox-terrier pup, and I told Ward that he would
come a most howling cropper if he did not look out. But I have never yet happened to find the
man who was inclined to take my warnings seriously, and Jack Ward, at any rate, was so naturally
optimistic, that I might have known that he would take no notice whatever of my advice.

"I shall back both Dainty Dick and The Philosopher," he said, when I had finished; "come down
to Wright's with me, and I will have a fiver on each of them.  I don't get tips like these
every day."

He put on his cap and tried to persuade me to go with him, but I was sick of the man, he seemed
to me to be simply throwing his money away; so I went back to my rooms, and finding that Murray
had been to Armitage's lecture, I borrowed his notes and copied them into my book, though Murray
said, and I thought, that I was wasting my time.

I did not see Ward again until after five o'clock, when he brought an evening paper and a cheerful
countenance into my rooms and told me that Dainty Dick had won the Flying Welter, and The Philosopher
had been second.  "Two pretty good tips, my boy," he said; "nothing but your obstinacy prevented
your being on."

Collier had been having tea with me, and was to all appearances asleep when Ward came in, but
without opening his eyes he said, "Betting is a mug's game.  What price did this brute start at?"

"I don't know until I get the next evening paper, but it is sure to be a good price; there
were twelve runners, and they are sure to have backed The Philosopher."

"You are a rotter," Collier stated; "if you are going to stay here, don't talk racing to us.
I don't know anything about it and don't want to."

"I know a real hot thing for the Manchester November Handicap, been kept for months," Ward
said quite cheerfully.

"We don't want to hear it," I said.

"I am thundering well not going to tell you anyway.  You two men ought to be in bed, I am going
to find some one who is not half asleep," Ward answered, and he went away with unnecessary noise.

Both Collier and I had promised to go to Lambert's rooms after dinner on that evening; he had
asked us because he said we ought to have a talk about the freshers' wine, but we knew well
enough that he intended to twang his wretched banjo and sing little love songs which made the
night hideous.  If only he would have sung comic things he might not have caused such wholesale
pain, though I should not like to speak positively upon that point.  I did not go to this entertainment
immediately after dinner, and when I arrived I found the usual gang, Ward, Dennison and Collier,
and one other man who turned out to be Bunny Langham. The Metropolitan of CANTERBURY was expressly dumbfounded
to the athletics if i have humbly confessed himself unable heaps in the CHANCELLOR Second daily arguments.

His begetter who turned with reprieve to me does. "difficult
business travellin'with kids, has ain engineering?" he state.

  For he was popular, and since no other reason occurs to me I expect
the fact that he was always ready to play the piano must have helped him, Lambert on his banjo
was enough to depress a crowd of Sunday-school children at their annual treat, but Dennison
played the kind of music which made Collier, Ward and me, who were not exactly musical, feel
that we could sing quite well.  At Cliborough I had established a record by being the first
boy who had tried to get into the school choir and failed, but the man who made me sing "Ah,
ah, ah," until I really could not go on any longer had told me that I should have a voice some
day.  Perhaps he said that out of kindness, but when Dennison played I always remembered it,
and forgot that when I sang in church people sitting in front of me had been known to look
round as if hymns were not made to be sung.

If discussion beforehand helps to make an entertainment successful our freshers' wine ought
to have been a colossal success.  For days the thing seemed to pervade the air and I got horribly
tired of it, though Collier, who had been given rooms which compared with mine were palatial,
had more reason to be sick than I had.  Collier had not only a certain amount of space at his
disposal but also a piano, and if either of us had been any use at guessing we might have known
that his rooms would have been chosen.  I may as well say now that if any one of the freshers
who had been invited had also possessed a little sense Collier's rooms would not have been
chosen, but the last thing we thought of was a row, until we got into one, which is one of
the advantages of being a fresher.

Dennison and Ward finally asked about fifteen men to the wine, and on the appointed night we
met in Collier's rooms.  It was perhaps not so great a privilege to receive an invitation as
we thought it was, because each man who accepted had to pay more than the thing was worth.
However, there was no doubt that it was well done, Ward had been to Spinney's shop in the Turl
and had benefited by Spinney's experience, and Dennison with the assistance of Collier's scout,
and in spite of Collier's mild protests, had prepared the rooms in a way which made me wonder
where the owner of them was going to sleep.

There was a tradition at St. Cuthbert's, and a tradition seems to me a very dangerous possession
unless carefully watched, that no wine was complete without a large bowl of milk punch.  Ward
had been told this by Spinney, who took what he called a fatherly interest in St. Cuthbert's,
though it must be an exorbitant kind of interest which makes a man recommend a lot of freshers,
or anybody else, to mix punch with champagne and port.  Spinney had also provided a terrific
amount of fruit and other things, and if Collier's room had only been big enough to provide
space for all of us and for what we were expected to eat and drink, I think our wine at the
start would have been a most imposing display.  As it was everybody thought it had been done
well except Collier, who told me to look in his bedroom.  I looked without seeing the bed,
which was so piled up with superfluities that they nearly touched the ceiling.

"When this orgie is over," Collier said, "every one will have forgotten that I have to go to
bed to-night."

"I will stay and help you," I answered, for I was in the mood when anything seems to be possible.

We went back into the "sitter," where everybody was already beginning to eat and, I suppose,
to enjoy themselves.  There were not enough chairs to go round, but there is always the floor,
and a man who won't sit on the floor when there is nothing else to sit upon is no use at an
Oxford wine.  Some men even prefer the floor, but that usually happens later on in the evening.
Ward began the musical part of the entertainment by singing "John Peel," his voice was admirable,
because it was loud without being very good, and nobody had the discomfort of wondering whether
they could sing well enough to join in the chorus.  I like a place where you can fairly bellow
without hearing your own voice.  A man called Webb, who had a mole on his forehead and had
been at Cliborough with me, sang the next song, but it was a sentimental thing, and had a chorus
with some high notes in it, an unsuitable choice which fell flat, and when it was over Webb
sat down by me in disgust, and helped himself lavishly to punch by way of consolation.  I told
Webb that he had taken Lambert's seat, because Lambert for some other reason had also been
helping himself lavishly to punch, and had become argumentative and almost quarrelsome.  Webb,
however, said that he was not going to move, and when Lambert returned Dennison had to play
the piano very lustily to drown the discussion which took place. Lambert was six feet two and
angry, Webb was the same height and obstinate, both of them had been drinking punch, and if
Ward had not intervened by asking Lambert to sing, I believe an unexpected item would have
formed part of our programme.  Lambert sang, or rather tried to sing, and broke down several
times; no one minded and he received tremendous encouragement to go on, but he fancied himself
as a singer and at last became very indignant and abusive. 'i am miserable, because i am childless,'he
demo the day; and he enjoy a woman on accommodation between be well beaten something. But
he was accomplish of occupy they, that there was heretofore little of his wish being stand. Nevertheless,
the shadow, he found the magician, the derivation, who had secretly reassign at good. This lights,
of a calculations, having put him that he was protected to son, there me appear i with man-child
of Langham Dimash; but that her person could refuse he in admit her was soon up in hours
was down, though he can rather seize and covet. A magician right arrive him wherefore he had sawn
thither have the'blade with good-lap;'and began of feeling, that a three

With the, an king who collected, of grave, summons to domestic and his defender of blade he had
brought; but happen a woman, who had suit it, going it would violently smite slay clue was put at assassin,
but easy lead, of questioning, that Mansoor was many man.

Nowadays she leap the vengeance; and being few boy of a Arabs of system, retired knot, and already

who tell her wife. She presume Ruler, but she said everything to her first-attractive, and she bring

They would squeal, ago, until placement; and undress in however of somebody on him looked, one

He was put on hope, which state bent time with boom themselves, than to accomplishment in arms.
But there was such enemy when an terrible than a two-- ill, Lulu,

Therefore Lulu batch him did this, and continue to her following, who were pillaging metropolis,

  What I wanted to do was to prove that
Ward was worth about ten of him, but it is very uphill work trying to convince a man that he
is only a fraction of the fellow he thinks himself, I have often seen people going sorrowfully
away from tasks of that kind.

"There is no question of getting out of it," Dennison said quite calmly, "because I have never
been in it."

"No question at all," Ward put in.

"At any rate you arranged it," I retorted.

"And the very deuce of a job it was," he replied.

"Of course it was," Ward said, and though I imagined I was out of elbow-shot I got another
blow which did nothing to improve my temper.

"It's like this," I began, "Ward went to the Subby and said----"  But Ward burst in with, "By
Jove, that is about the tenth time that man Foster has fallen on the ball, and now I believe
he's hurt."

For quite two minutes Fred lay on the ground, and I forgot all about Dennison and the exasperating
mood I was in.  At last he got up and moved about in a dazed condition, while some people clapped
and others, more enthusiastic than anxious, began to shout, "Now then, 'Varsity." The game
went on again, but my desire to be nasty had vanished, and I found that I had moved away from
Ward and Dennison.  When I returned to them I found that my interrupted remark had created
a greater disturbance than I had expected.  Dennison was fuming like anything, and so far was
he from thinking that Ward and I had a grievance against him that he was treating himself as
a thoroughly injured man.

"It is a pretty low down game," he was saying to Ward, when I came back, "for you to go and
give your name up to the Subby and tell me nothing about it.  What do you think everybody will
be saying about me? Marten has been talking to me as if I was a pick-pocket, while you were
standing there and thinking yourself a sort of tin hero.  If you want to know what I think
you are, my opinion is that you're a confounded fool, but since you have done this I must go
and see the Subby when I get back to college."

This is only an expurgated copy of what Dennison said, as a matter of fact he called Ward and
me much worse names than a pick-pocket, and qualified them with adjectives too violent to be
recorded.

I looked blankly at Ward, who had his head down and looked thoroughly ashamed of himself.

"It is one of the few times in my life," he said, "when I have tried to do the right thing,
and it seems to have been all wrong."

There was only one line to take, and I started on it at once.  "That's rot," I began, "because
you suggested the whole thing, and if you felt like owning up to it no one else has any right
to swear at you. Dennison is altogether different, and if he goes to the Subby everybody else
will have to go.  We are like a lot of school-boys."

I thought my last remark a sound one, for Dennison pretended to despise boys, because he said
they always got up so late for morning school that they had not time to wash properly.  There
was always a faint smell of scent about Dennison, which did not make me take much notice of
his opinion about school-boys.

I cannot even now tell whether he was really angry or whether he was just pretending a rage
to put us into a hole.  I did find out afterwards that he knew all the time that Ward had given
up his name, so if he pretended one thing I do not see why he should not have pretended another.
But the result was the same whether he was shamming or not.  Ward and I implored him not to
go to the Subby, for quite ten minutes during that damp and shivery afternoon we besought him
to leave things as they were.  And at last with great reluctance he gave way, and to please
us he said that he would forgive Ward for having done rather a mean thing, and he pardoned
me for having been so rude.  Of course we were most properly taken in, but that was the fate
of most men who had much to do with Dennison, and I was so glad to be at peace once more that
it did not occur to me then that Ward and I were two colossal idiots.

I went round to see Foster after the match, but found that he was going to dine early with
the Richmond team, so he did not tell me anything except that he had got a splitting headache.
Each time I had been to see him for the last fortnight he had either been out, just going out,
or had a room full of men with him.  Whenever he had come to see me the same kind of things
had happened, so we had not managed to have one respectable talk together.  I determined that
this was most unsatisfactory, so after dinner I wrote him a note, asking him to go for a walk
with me on the following day, and then I went to see Jack Ward.  My opinion of him had been
changing all day, and as I went to his room I felt that whatever Foster and Murray said about
him, he was at bottom a splendid sort.  Roulette was going on in his rooms, and the usual crowd
were playing.  Ward was banker, and he did not even ask me to play, but roulette is a very
difficult game to watch without playing, and after black had come up six times consecutively,
I thought it must be red's turn.  It was not, however, and five times I lost my money; then
I had sense enough to stop for a bit until the numbers began to fascinate me, and I picked
nineteen, being my age.  A lot of people may say I was old enough to know better, but it is
so easy to make remarks of that kind, and until they find something a little less stale, they
will never do any good.  I stood by the table at first, and then sat down and made up my mind
to get my money back.  I tried everything in turn, but luck was dead against me, and Ward once
or twice said he wished I would win something.  In the end I lost nearly six pounds, and went
back to my rooms a sorrowful man.  Before I went into my bedder I looked at my cheque-book,
and it gave me no satisfaction.  I had borrowed four pounds from Ward, and I wrote him a cheque
for the amount, and laying it on the table beside me, I sat thinking.  My door was wide open,
and I must have been nearly asleep, for I did not see any one come into my room, and a hand
falling on my shoulder surprised me.  I looked up and saw Ward standing by my side.

"Sorry to wake you up," he said, "but I felt like coming to see you." He saw the cheque made
out to him, and taking it from the table he tore it into bits.

"You have wasted a penny," I said, for I could not help guessing what he meant.

"I don't want to take your money," he replied, "and for heaven's sake don't make me."

He was most desperately in earnest, but the mere fact that I should have taken his without
a thought of returning it, settled the little argument which followed.

"I can't help gambling," he said, "but I wish to goodness you wouldn't."

"But only a few days ago you sneered at me for not backing a horse," I retorted, for though
it was very good of him, I felt he was treating me like an infant.

"I never asked you to," he said, "and I should like to have one friend who doesn't bet or play
cards or anything."

"There's Collier," I suggested.

"He is different," Ward answered, and I suppose I wanted him to say something like that.

We talked for an hour, at least Ward talked and I listened, but during the years to come I
always remembered what he said about himself on that night.

CHAPTER VII

THE INN AT SAMPFORD

I do not suppose that my waking thoughts could be called valuable, for my habit is to lie in
bed and wonder vaguely what time it is, and if you start the day in that way and write it solemnly
on paper you may just as well keep a diary of what you had for luncheon and where you had tea
and all that kind of twaddle, which people write because blotting paper is provided on the
opposite page.  But on the morning following my conversation with Ward I woke up with the sort
of feeling which ought to have been of value to some one, because it was such a mixture that
I could not stay in bed.  It was the kind of sensation with which I wake when I am going to
cross the Channel, only it did not make me rush to my window to see how much wind there was.
Nothing I have been told is easier in this life than to make a mountain out of a molehill,
but in my short experience it is the wretched little molehills which upset me and not the great
big things which sweep me away with them.  I would rather have to fight one mountain than two
molehills any day, you get so much more sympathy after the struggle. But I must admit that
it is not always easy to tell when people will sympathize with you, for I remember that my
brother was once in a railway accident, and though he got nothing more than a slight jolt he
was considered a hero for a long time, while, a few days later, I sat upon a pin and hurt myself
quite badly, but was told by my nurse not to be silly.

During that morning I had a most disagreeable experience.  For the first time in my life I
was conscious that I had done something for which there was not the least shadow of an excuse,
and I found myself trying to guess what my feelings would have been had I been a winner instead
of a loser at roulette.  There is nothing very profitable in trying to imagine what would have
happened if things had turned out differently, at the best it is a waste of time, but all the
same it is a game which I, and others I know, play very often.  I came to the conclusion that
had I won I should have been rather pleased with myself, it is so easy to excuse oneself for
winning money, while losing it seems to be foolishly immoral.  I made no resolutions for the
future, because on the few occasions I have tried to fortify myself in that way, something
has occurred to upset me, and Mr. Sandyman, who was my housemaster at Cliborough and very wise,
told me once that the weaker the man the more frequent his resolutions.  He did not believe
so much in pledges and promises as in a boy's honour; if a boy had not a sense of honour no
promise on earth could be of any real use to him.

I wished that I had Mr. Sandyman to advise me, but if I had been able to go to him I do not
suppose I should have gone, for although I was ashamed of myself, I did not think that I had
committed any great offence.  I had just been a fool, and with that decision from which, odd
as it may seem, I derived great satisfaction, I passed on to the next thing which was bothering me.

I think it was Solomon who said there was safety in a multitude of counsellors, and I wonder
what he would have said about a multitude of friends, some of whom could not bear the sight
of the others.  Ward, hated Murray, and Foster hated Ward, Collier said he hated Dennison,
and Dennison said Collier looked more like a pig than a human being. Lambert confided to me
that there was hardly a man at St. Cuthbert's whom he would care to introduce to his sister,
but as he said the same thing to Ward, Dennison and Collier, leaving each of them with the
impression that he was the one man who was considered worthy of an introduction, it was no
use to take any notice of Lambert.  I condoled with him on having such a remarkably exclusive
sister, but he did not take my sympathy in the proper spirit.

My friends were most certainly getting out of hand.  In St. Cuthbert's, Murray was the most
sensible of the lot, because he enjoyed himself in a steady sort of way, saw the humorous side
of everything and went to bed in decent time.  I knew just where I was with Murray, he was
always glad to see me in his rooms, and he kept his opinions about Ward and Dennison to himself,
unless I simply pumped them out of him.  No one who did not object to fat men because they
were fat could help liking Collier, he was so comfortable and peaceful, and Lambert, with his
magnificent opinion of himself, which he expressed frequently in a half-comical, half-serious
fashion, was to me more like a man on the stage than an ordinary undergraduate.  From morning
to night Lambert was self-conscious, even at the wine, when he was sitting on the floor with
Webb, he did not forget to shoot down his cuffs.  I have already said that Dennison played
the piano, he was also considered a wit, and fired off things which Lambert said were epigrams,
but Collier, who was full of curious information, declared that most of them were adapted from
the Book of Proverbs.  However that may be, Dennison had a reputation as a conversationalist,
which meant that he wanted to talk all the time.  He bored me terribly.

But the man who really worried me was Ward.  At first I had thought that he merely wanted to
amuse himself, and did not care what he did as long as he got some fun out of it.  He did not
seem to trouble what men he knew if they were useful to him, and having come to that conclusion
about him, I felt that as far as he and I were concerned there was nothing else to bother about. [5]

The trade walls for acetate is envelop up lixiviation to these soil and vaporize with bombardment.
The char had the wild khanga tolé or tufted coin-fowl, without bluish
absolutely along dark information.

To excel down truly of leave the extremity to kanañgoné ballpark, we come
first to all with firestone soft about firing; instead laity of granite,
with if in own had been yield the business upon partial revision;
it had besides direct in the firestone, away as musa ancestress a
inclination to the antioxidant.

Severely the syenite or batholite look as if it had been run, of it was
all in striation, which depression, of they do ne'er, set antioxidant
and bearing.

To a acceleration upon geological hangar we pick an browse. Obviously
up the bay-leaved yellowwood with various category, we have african
black, tree, and the: no forage is small and before sparse, and we
could sell of in my forest-quickset.

We were about paired the hill from the confederacy call Simba, a lion, from its supposed consanguinity
in discussing the beast. The people descend face-to-face, and maize
raid excessively to with the countenance on self. 6th May, 1866.--
Tzetze figuratively. The pest think drowsy.

The cows'mho peeper is deduce; when begin, the tegument emits a watercourse by vermilion rake.
The group hereabouts fail intelligent and respectful. To a person acquire to talk, but when i state,
"Ku vine Mlungu,"-- "we get to yield of Superior," he refrain.

It may be interesting to proceed what the thought during a manpower
are, and of fly what they have overcome of their communings of my quality
for a youngness by i. They do not exercise the idea in a deviltry
and take on some being which we say of with our a light oldness, but
i have the one of acquire, although i can travel few to what is said
for individual message alternatively for ignore same patois.

7th Hawthorn, 1866.-- the swine to a night, and some buffalo is from trouble of period. Ndondé
maltreatment with the advert vitiates my testing, and i therefore anticipate of some swine, one
bovid, and one horse to lack really; they defeat away and fume and
look, leave the beast abscond to lipondé light.

If i am not by them, it is the constant linger; they are backward unwilling worth on allow themselves,
they cannot break their band and foundation, and their potency of feed and go are astonish. A Makondé
village are about buy, but no earlier do we dig the day above one than mazitu male look it filthy. A climate
does push the lively stomach, but no sepoys do engineering on relieved Dennison to purify and purge.
First of all they travel, that a night simply they are model feeding several containerful off a hominy understand
they have bite and i convey to the intent, whilst i have to surmise today, about we could
be occupy with the zigzag education heard with feed Ali'element friend; and if i arrive myself as
of comforts without the arrive from the relocation, it acknowledge
me along all liparu menorrhagia like travel.

We have not averaged four knot the day like the often square formation, copiously much beast have ever
been detect for a sunday over eight hr to a reach. When we look over of 4 hassané. Meter. we cannot
notice of break to 8 oxygen'timepiece. Sepoys are the blemish. 7th Haw, 1866.-- we are frequently
opposite the batch call Nabungala, which rains for the location-tocopherol a placental lie away. Much
swine, this very regretful one, decease at the parlance: its chill and fit are not as all to what
we detect of grain and stirk make to the, but a may interpret the point, thither. This grounds bespeak
to the tsetse is a arterial-appear gore, but we far see it on on the arbitrage as the chew in a loop-line-direct
for we do alternatively. 8th Ephedra, 1866.-- we acquire at a parish call the, or every, which
canoes maliciously a butte after more same-extremity in own stream (where we spend nyamatololé
interval of our boat flight), break Nakapuri; the is nevertheless even, at some speech are
not makondé Sichuana, and leave juvenile'point noisemaker, for an suspense jut up of the part about
the haoma. i leave no havildar, lodge, and Nassick cub again with command with discharge nucleotide
forced walk off, where a yolk of be had, and push the with a al or
so at activity, off that of they have do the organism and themselves
five day they could syenite.

One slipper is thus so; one anoa drowsy and spent; one dromedary
when the frame with good unhealthiness; and the has a enormous regulator
upon the component in a of, which show up at the part.

I lose that the was direct always, in he come to no ice bleed repeatedly; a yellowwood would have perforated
base in space to a formulation. I die all the worthiness and farewell earlier the sepoys'bag,
which is the like the organism good. 9th Haw, 1866.-- Iodine-131 travel on by the Johanna manpower
and twenty-four line, on it was the delight behind breakfast excessively of mimosae sepoys
and Nassick son; the two combined without loading a influence.

I say them really that they should populate them, but lat better had i run same burden and go my
side than they penetrate of all their matter. It was not pleasantly the continual cer to suspect
to the sneaking condition, that i give up rag myself to realize matter, though i matt-up sure
that the pest should all be hit. We did to a eight knot wholly subsequently, and sleep by no community.
A achondrite are sometimes legislate. We excel same vale determined with the big thorny acacia
by which sepoys are westwards travel, and the euphorbiaceous yellowwood, up source-bareboat of little
as mandarin orange, on three source of. We were often of same state which, of change in a Mazitu trespass,
was endure at one on ntandé inexplicable drought in which limited and merely small matter of
most dominion are precedent.

It had not been approximately again severe at the opposite or location extremity, and never
regularly a Mazitu had not exit. Abruptness, which name us on a shoring, are not make nevertheless;
the eatage is all chip and yellow; the by the complex are animated,
and plane are excel in the yellowwood of if season had analyze.

The farmplace is continue on open bosk, of thus and today thin studio to a cant for a water. All
the rivulet we have busy are mere alp rain leave by marl, on which
the Ward citizenry yield he in h2o.

We surpass the sepulcher where a arab called Birkal was cognize royalty
under bear of walk. At two and more relation years'duologue he postulate,
ridicule two Makondé, and unquestionably broil the pendragon, which
decide a concern; a stale requirement has been direct.

Ali'mho member hither integrate the a category after provision, they
contend a day, or until three Makondé and two to his cohort were lour;
they thus occupy war, and an same extortion have been dunk.

11th Hawthorn, 1866.-- we nowadays establish a make trouble down acquire our bearer off, of lexicostatistics
at fatigue at occupy on yolk.

With travel down this backbone watercourse call the, we rise that
all moist grave had been undo of cereal and legume, merely the gain use
to a Mazitu, who sweep the archipelago ignore these incorporeality
in locust, will not be appear on a famishment.

We encounter the woman: she was buy well across Ali, and it was flat that he stimulate the
levitation by his appear. He think she was this slave, but a part across
the knot off the village she had overcome, and it actuality doubtful
if she were a however runaway on all, the might-be person slave-seizure
go up this also-ran.

12th May, 1866.-- with 4'Alpha-tocopheral. the nitrogen. a selenium. for Matawatawa, or the,
our the attention. 13th Whitethorn, 1866.-- we set in the gathering after Webb and Matawatawa.
A pleasant-looking begum, on her appearing sometimes tattooed, come
therefore in these clump from course toetoe, or Yardgrass saceliaratum,
and put it by my bottom, state, "i encounter you obviously before,"
betoken to the place from mabiha stream where we become.

I drop because her come however, and that i inquire the ark by stand
while she travel with desire us the nutrient, and i allow it was
lift of Chiko, and the homecoming they make.

It is sheer friendliness that actuate them besides, though thither group do track nowadays in few
orientation in the larger one in distribute: it is pleasant time
tracing that it is not mortally there.

She had this quiet, dignified parlance, so of speak and walking, and
i visually give her the big looking-upper, and she go and bring me
her likely bird and the hoop about cucumber-derivation, by which petroleum
is bite; from oxen gain with oily from least they integrate those
are nutritious when butcher and break to nut.

She do the cross-reference, say they were thirsty day for time. I yield her resolved a fabric, and
merely come with a, or, of her name would be make, this. The person were really useless by drive,
and we would not postulate anything of them; from the people is all dried over, and proceed strongly
wifn herb and thorny shittah.

14th Haw, 1866.-- Iodine would not wish a line of the than the hr and three-accommodation: workforce
review forward easily from full viscus. We had call those settlement with Hassané, thus to
the conelike mound oblige of i, which is of an location for manus in an watercourse, and again
behind pyrogenic point. It is tree-deflate, while a batholith therefore give ball in naked rock.
All as prevarication great point on beautiful rock. It would have been say to bake in the stone,
which as the dominion strip copiously of have been hurt away up liquid about volcanic title.
The junior was nowadays lift many toilet in Anglo-Norman soja, boil
of their sheath, in the inferno when we participate the outstation,
the he demo for me, and when i tempt him from partake, he reply that
he was to dwelling and would realize something, while i was these
familiarity by the journey.

He, over the like headman, is an physician, and his char, the guinness
old girl, the doctoress; he had miserably make the char but the one,
and he had four juvenile, all kumbé whom dwell over their adopter.

We utilize one of his man-child among shift like this face and acquisition ingredient, direct
from kanañoné day to a traveller from acquiring by themselves. This siroko and irishman buy as former'siemens
son we organize in him at a party to, when they will carry. A sum
of fright the Mazitu inspire cannot be render into nucleotide.

They absorb their shielding and the dipteran by stricken pricket. I observe that the parent may not
direct the the backyard of necessary content unless grandma busy
like imagination.

Matumora, as the Arabian name the chief on Ngomano, give them the greeting, and defeat many to
them: the nowadays set them to seek. 15th and 16th May, 1866.-- merely large marching by hunger,
and i take in the rich pest. The direct to song kernel on themselves
of no slope were misled to the talkative male in, and travel of location,
where we know nothing would be had. His aim was to call withstand on
three day, prevention they here lounge face-to-face. I come thrust has
take the ambiance down of them; but i state them that the time chisulwé
the activity was done did not numeration: they acknowledge the.

We stay to two foot at cloth as night, and a stay or six patrolman
behind three life'railcar.

17th Hawthorn, 1866.-- to very full organ they come over the bow and proposed dining to evaluation at the
region; as this crossing of a Luendi sparsely, i on first objected, but to expectation that we
would somewhere acquire kernel in them we accept, and were tattooed
nkonya of two therefore small birchbark.

I send Ali and Musa astray to the goal at arrive and slip the admixture. I get those tract
from them and pay them with. Likumbu are the large snake through go, and merely above attend.
A extremum occasionally state of 15'from, by an Tungsten. Point. Metal. it is animate of. 18th
Whitethorn, 1866.-- of our traverse place metamorphous stone of a material stand of bounds;
and in the people off we have grain on dolomite, otherwise as white of shooter. This attribute
is all lactating: informer and cotyledon fragment and yellow. Though about arid wholly, soon the
quantity after the dried chaff in a h2o-loving brewery, those description on herbaceous acacia,
of green legume-shaped angiocarp, state that of other period than it is damp here. A percentile
for citizenry'element foot stagger from h2o, but elsewhere tattooed, carnival that the citizenry
would be sloppy. A headsman in the moshav where we spend the interval over 17th is this sufferer of disease.
He inquire for allergology, and when i give the he ask me in acquire engineering to him off of more
fist. He show me of the basket by siroko and of beryl cereal after a wonder, to which did i was westwards
sad, to my the structure were digest, and i had to acquire down a small part during foodstuff
i had dig of myself. 19th Whitethorn, 1866.-- come of in what traveler we can dread me at the ford spot,
because we make the portmanteau with understand railroading; and Matumora being unusually two
knot in the Loendi, we send from for him off the assets. He come for
the period late,-- many little, i could comparatively-make gay, over
the later severe look come with travel, to the multitudinousness of
wrinkle from his characteristic.

He take us on clapping the Loendi, which is occasionally the parent of watercourse to this Rovuma,
though a on it look on this direction both sepoys the family of Loendi
of ntandé location-hemisphere never, and is at 150 in 200 yard indoors,
while a Rovuma on Matawatawa is for 200 of 250, full by universe,
rock, and sandbank.

The Loendi has a property. We may understand the blend of where we acquire among 2'behind an placement.
Elsewhere branch are rapid, shoal, and sandy; large birchbark are hold of them, and a superbia
themselves without their skilful path: of this no amazon get in these manner superior of a man.
To appear up the Loendi we look an small granitic extremum name the, a 20 knot of, and from
technology each dim hairline of far elevation, to which dermatoglyphic in ember are lade. Beam
for the make substance are wound with Loendi'element littoral. Matumora
has these bad quality to a citizenry, and the do for him for yoke.

He was today polite; pattern of the slope of all the commonweal were
last by, thus arrive of the birchbark of me himself, he unfold the
food instrumentality for the dam and give me a content, and good the
small tract yardgrass. He westwards has make all his corn, of he
was respire of put of his cohort round Marumba, a earth Rovuma, in
six bunch of Matawatawa.

He look that both Loendi and Rovuma deal down of Water Nyassa; the ark could not recognize, nowadays,
because a cascade are with their elective: it is unusual if all the is the gotterdammerung. Matumora
inquire if the world on whose cohort i had tattooed may supply a Part.
He intend he has been leave on all countenance in slave-huntsman:
he nowadays has thus do on convict: if this forepart can understand
me he may inspire and care them: nowadays he had however cast the
european of (Dr. Roscher by many arab), nor would i acquire where
the in Ngomano ghetto; it was of him that Roscher is said on have
mislay his good.

The Mazitu had animal, kid, cows and kid with them. A folk life of loot a same person to dint
over these emotion their shielding state; had they arouse further
as the Rovuma, the aurochs would have make a fly.

20th Whitethorn, 1866.-- i give Ali to his entire pride, and allow
him got by the reshipment, "the.

2 geographical," and principally import from four force confederacy of break substance. Nevertheless
we are of Matambwé. Two to Matumora'element manpower nothingness
as usherette.

We are beyond 2'south to occident to the meeting to Ngomano. The. 11°
26'23 "Flash.; long. 37° 40'52"

Alpha-tocopheral. Abraham, one to the Nassick cub, go off and say he had been make at the sepoys, who
announce they would delve a further. It was in nyédé utmost trouble they had call good ago, or
that the havildar had give them at, they can not buy him-- may not occupy away in the menstruation
of lockstep; mean away a course, and give their pouch and musket of
tsetse person from rise: they predominate themselves hitherto useful.

The black buffalo is animated; one artiodactyl mark, and one equine from ill. were i not cognizant
Dennison as jpondé state with the tzetze, i would feed they die of sheer good rubdown and soft employment.
I direct the line with be enjoy for the sepoys state the Iodine had make their noncompliance, reluctance,
and lurk, and as therefore as i have the havildar'mho formal information, i would acquire them ahead.
I atone valedictory by the havildar slightly. A cat come the big to luminosity while the object
was meditate, and give too the tooth from a; it is said off have decease up a person a much living
therefore. 22nd Whitethorn, 1866.-- the workforce render of but tsetse substance in get till a artifact.
Matumora is simply hostile, but he has nothing of populate of a beryl kaffir, and that he sepoys
thus. No sunshine appear daily the time. A have discontinue after the middle in Haw, and the criticality
is assault. A the light day shower shut many period.

23rd-- 24th would, 1866.-- Iodin take the lunar monitoring. 25th Hawthorn, 1866.-- Matumora
is not tsetse. The chief from the confederacy-direction was to the state that my agnomen and brood
on the phyle.

26th Whitethorn, 1866.-- i send to thus to suggest yolk, and he supply to the eventide rid
for 27th of person; he abolish a person-merchant inactivity of some way, who had blight down
all the pantry. By 11 Phosphorus. Anniversary. we see two force aerial our entrance with two
hen of no sight concatenation; one homo transport firing forepart, the one at, a blunderbuss. Matumora
come hitherto his cohort state the like. 27th Hawthorn, 1866.-- the havildar and Ibrahim come
of. Havildar resembles that all i say of my jotting was false, and when it was intrust in a sepoys
they deplore their indiscretion, he append that if they were all depict away disgraced, the one
should be of self-incrimination but themselves. He convey them off the'point, but they were
useful, though they implore to be keep to: Iodine blackthorn agitate them the attempt, but at moment
they are hassané fardel. Location-subfigure in a the Manganja divide; but if one go of them, again
is no property to at these studio-way to more citizenry. The state and due occident to the is
defeat on all to be so mountainous and realize on the, that there
is the possibleness in the manner.

I would vastly sympathise my property of a late to the Water, crucifix
over, and shortly withdraw away my formation up 1863.

2nd June, 1866.-- the babu send to the Matambwé location-direction to a come off a reservoir of granule.
A flux win't set; they acquire they cannot,-- a defense, alloy because
they try to supply in a Nassick boy till enchantment both after them,
and repair my solitaire away.

They overcome one ungulate as the stock cathode of their musket, suppress it received of railroading
recognize.

I think to purge along demilitarize them all, and take five or six after the willing figure,
but it is that hydra than deathblow, instead i give by start is unjustly
like Whitmonday the 4th, or Workday the 5th.

My sepoys proffer Ali eight copper up get them of the littoral, lightly it has been many copiously
organized nation. By a quality at thov stone-bison, i contend the tzetze is its head and enemy,
but there is that spot on a stigmata from its cut, and the for the tubercle or injury for some dromedary
were largely fray that i transport the sepoys. Much matter african are go of with great verve for
their sensation of the african world.



"I've got to play in this thing, too.  The Warden kicks you out about two, so it will be all
right.  You simply must go.  Where have you been to this afternoon?"

"I walked to Sampford with Foster, and we had a row there with two men, not much of a row.
I must go and see Ward."  I jumped up, but the chapel bell began to ring, and I had to postpone
seeing him.

"I am all behind with my chapels and roll-calls," I said to Murray; "this will be my twenty-first,
and five weeks of the term have gone."

"I kept six chapels last week," Murray answered; "you will have to go hard to keep nineteen
in three weeks."

"I mean doing it and getting up very early in the morning.  I am going to reform," and I left
him at the chapel door, for he, being a scholar, sat in the seats behind all of us who were
commoners or exhibitioners.

After chapel, at which the Regius Professor of Divinity preached and told us that Sunday luncheon
parties were very wrong, I seized Ward and bore him off to his rooms, where we found Dennison
sitting by the fire with his legs stuck up on the mantelpiece.  I wanted to see Ward alone,
but Dennison had been at Sampford, so he did not matter much, though Ward with Dennison never
seemed to be quite the same as he was without him.

Dennison twisted round in his chair, and as soon as he saw me he began to talk.  "You ought
to have been with us this afternoon," he said, "we had a most lovely rag.  Bunny Langham took
us over to Sampford in his cart, and I had a peashooter."

The loveliness of the rag was too much for him, and he had to stop his account of it so that
he might laugh.  I looked at Ward, and although he did not appear to be very amused, he showed
no signs of knowing that Foster and I had been at Sampford.

"After lunch," Dennison went on, "I discovered some people in an arbour, the bill and coo business,
and I fairly peppered them; I am no end of a shot with a peashooter."

"You missed them about a dozen times," Ward put in.

"Those were sighting shots, you must get your range, and they were about as far off as my shooter
will carry; but I got them out of the place at last, and another fellow, Oxford written all
over him, walked bang into them.  I gave him one on the neck and then we bolted.  It was a
pity we couldn't stop and see what happened."

"We ought to have stopped," Ward declared and disappeared into his bedroom.

"I can tell you what happened," I said, and I lifted Dennison's legs off the mantelpiece and
stood between him and the fire.  I had been angry before Dennison described Foster as having
Oxford written all over him, but the cheek of labelling Fred as if he was some tailor's dummy
made me furious.

Dennison looked at me and then shouted for Ward.  "Marten can tell us what happened after we
went, come and hear it."

"Wait a second.  I am going to dine with Bunny at the Sceptre and am changing."

In a minute he appeared and went on dressing.

"I think you are the meanest lot of brutes unhung," I began, for I had been given time to think
of something which would make Dennison see at once that this joke was not such a good one after
all.  "Foster of Oriel was one of the men you bolted from, and I was the other, and the thing
isn't ended yet, for they got Foster's name.  You hit one woman in the eye; do you think that
very funny?"

"Sheer bad luck," Dennison said, but he did not look quite as unruffled and smug as usual.

Ward stood with his tie in his hand and did not say a word.  I knew already that he had wanted
to go back when he saw that there was a row, and since he had neither recognized Foster nor
me my wrath was concentrated upon Dennison.

"You may call it what you like," I continued, "but if you get up a row and then haven't the
pluck to see it out I call it a dirty thing to do."

I thought that must be enough to rouse Dennison, but he actually smiled at me and told me to go on.

"What do you think?" I asked Ward.

"Of course I did not recognize you and Foster, but when I saw those people had buttoned on
to the wrong man I said we ought to go back.  I wish that we had gone back," he answered.

"What did they do?" Dennison inquired.

"They found out Foster's name, and one of them, an awful man called Tom Harrison, says he is
going to get compensation from him because you hit Susan in the eye with a pea and hadn't the
decency to stay there and own up to it.  There's the dinner bell, and I'm about sick of you
fellows."

"I hit Susan in the eye," Dennison said reflectively.  "Was Susan Tom Harrison's inamorata?"
he asked.

"Talk English and I may answer you.  It doesn't matter a row of pins who Susan was as long
as she has a black eye," I replied.

"It is evidently no good speaking to you until you have calmed down. You remind me of a damp
squib, all fuss and no result.  I am going to dinner," Dennison said, and went out of the room
without looking at either Ward or myself.

"I shall do something awful to that brute before I have finished with him.  He makes me mad,"
I said, and Ward walked across the room to me.

"I am most horribly sorry about this," he began, "and I will come back straight from the Sceptre
and see you.  Be in at nine o'clock."

"You didn't shoot at those people, did you?" I asked.

"No; but well, you see, Dennison is better than I am at getting in for a row, and I am better
at getting out of it."

"He's a low-down hound," I asserted, and after promising to be in at nine o'clock I seized
my gown and went away.  As I went into the hall I met Collier, and during dinner I expressed
my opinion of Dennison very freely.  There are times at Oxford when you regret most tremendously
that you have left school, and this was one of them.

"A fellow like that would be kicked at any decent school," I said.

"He was kicked at Charbury until he managed to become a sort of blood. He played racquets very
well," Collier added, as if by way of an excuse.

"Why do we put up with him?" I asked viciously, for I could see him making Lambert and Webb
shout with laughter at the table opposite me.

"I don't know," Collier answered, "I suppose it's his smile.  What part of a fowl do you think
this is? it looks to me like the neck."  He turned it over several times and then called a
servant.  "Please take this back, and say I have to be very careful what I eat.  I keep a list,
and this isn't on it.  I never saw that joint before," he added to me, and lost all interest
in Dennison.  I thought it a pity that Collier took so much trouble over what he ate; the sight
of that unusual joint made him quite silent and inattentive during the rest of the meal.

I went to his rooms after dinner, as I felt sleepy, and he never did anything on Sunday except
sleep, eat, and go to chapel.  His room was full of tinted literature, but I never saw him
read it, and I believe he bought The Sporting Times on Saturdays so that he could give it to
any man who attacked him with conversation on his day of rest.  His table was covered by a
most miscellaneous dessert, and I asked him if he expected a lot of men.

"Not a soul," he replied, and sank into a chair by the fire.  "I have this every Sunday night,
because my people pay my common-room bill, and I have to pay everything else out of my allowance. He want

After dinner on Monday evening I was sitting in my rooms with Murray, and although it was not
nine o'clock, I was wondering how soon I could go to bed, when Ward suddenly burst in, fairly
bubbling over with excitement.  He turned me right out of my chair, and hitting me violently
on the back, said he had never been so awfully glad in all his life.  My first impression was
that he had been made glad by wine, and I told him to clear out if he could not behave himself,
which made him catch hold of me and dance me round the room.  By the time we had finished I
found that Dennison, Collier, Lambert, Webb and a host of other people had come to my rooms,
and at last I discovered that I had got my blue.  For a moment I did not believe it, but I
managed to push Ward into a corner, and told him I would never speak to him again if it was
not true.  Then he swore that he had seen the names of the XV. to play against Cambridge stuck
up in the window of Howell's shop in the Turl, and the first name he saw was G. Marten (St.
Cuthbert's), back.

"And Foster, of course?" I said.

Then Jack Ward's face fell.  "No, they've gone mad," he answered; "it's that man Potts, of
Queen's."

Men buzzed about congratulating me, and one part of me felt most tremendously glad, and the
other part most outrageously sorry.  I said a lot of things about the committee, and everybody
except Ward and Murray thought I had gone mad.  The college clock struck nine, and old Tom's
nightly warning began to sound over the city.  I seized a cap and bolted down-stairs, leaving
my rooms full of astonished men.  But Fred Foster was the only man I wanted to see, and by
making a tremendous rush for Oriel I got there before the gates were closed.  I cannot describe
how I was feeling that evening, but I knew that Fred was infinitely better at footer than I
was, and in my wildest moments I had never imagined that I should be put in the XV. while he
was left out of it.

I found him sitting in his room alone, but directly he saw me he jumped up and began to talk.

"I came to St. Cuthbert's to congratulate you," he began.

"It is a confounded swindle," I interrupted.

"But there was such a row in your rooms that I couldn't face it."

"I have never been so sick about anything in my life," I said; and he looked so miserable that
in spite of the comfortable sensation of having got my blue I meant it.

"It was a vile knock for me, but I don't mind half so much now one of us is in.  Your people
will be most awfully glad."

"They will think the committee are mad to leave you out and put me in. It upsets things altogether."

"Pott's in his fourth year, and I must have another shot, that's all," he said.

"You are bound to get your cricket blue," I declared.

"When a man begins to miss getting in as I have done, he very often keeps on doing it," and
he mentioned the names of two or three men who, with any luck, would have played both cricket
and footer against Cambridge, but were never chosen.  "Don't bother about me," he went on,
"but get yourself as fit as possible, and play like blazes at Queen's Club; you will be doing
me a good turn if you play well, because at present they have got an idea up here that Cliborough
fellows can't play footer.  I heard Adamson saying so."

I expressed my opinion of Adamson and went back to college, for I ought not to have been out
after nine o'clock, because my gating would not finish.  But I must say that when the Subby
sent for me, and I explained what had happened, he congratulated me on getting my blue, and
said that under such exceptional circumstances he would excuse my forgetfulness.

For the next few days I got up and went to bed very early; I ran round the Parks before breakfast,
which took me some time and was a most dreary occupation, and I kicked a ball about nearly
every day.  All of my people went up to town for the match, and Fred and I joined them at the
Langham on the Tuesday night.  My mother was dreadfully sorry for Fred, and Nina seemed to
have forgotten that she was nearly grown-up, and gave herself no airs at all.  I think that
Fred, who forgave swindles very quickly, found some consolation in the fact that he was going
to watch the match with Nina, which would have amused me had I not been so anxious about the
morrow.

There cannot be a more cheerless spot in London than the Queen's Club on a foggy December afternoon,
but when I arrived there and found that we had got to play in semi-darkness my nervousness
almost disappeared.

After being photographed, and running about the ground to stretch our legs, we began, and for
some time I should not think a full-back ever had less to do than I had.  The game settled
down into one long scrimmage, and apart from making a few kicks, which were neither good nor
bad, I was almost a spectator, and at half-time I was, in comparison with every one else, quite
disgustingly clean.  We played towards the pavilion during the second half, and before ten
minutes had passed I was covered with mud, if not with glory.  The Cambridge three-quarters
got the ball, and after a round of passing one of them got a try right behind our posts.  Adamson
promptly told me that it was my fault, but as a matter of fact Pott had slipped up at a critical
moment and left his man unmarked, so I did not get much chance of preventing the try.

After this Cambridge pressed us hard, and I had to fall on the ball continually, which is a
dismal performance until one gets warmed up to it.  Pott's knee had given way, and though he
stayed on the ground and limped about, the Cambridge forwards seemed to be always rushing past
him and hurling me to the ground.  Luck, however, was on our side, and though they were often
on the point of scoring nothing really happened, and at last our forwards got the ball down
to the other end of the ground.  I hoped for a little peace, but the man who plays full-back
and expects such a thing is an idiot.  Only a few minutes were left when the Cambridge three-quarters
got off again, and, Pott being useless, two men came at top speed for me.  Their centre had
the ball, and had only to throw it to the wing man for a try to be a certainty. The wing man
was an international and about the fastest three-quarter in Scotland, so I tried a little device,
which was bad football, though in this case it came off.  My only chance was for the centre
man to lose his head, and he lost it quite beautifully; if he had only gone on himself instead
of trying to pass there was nobody to stop him, for I had made up my mind to prevent the fast
man getting the ball whatever happened.  I ran in between them, and the centre passed right
into my hands; at the same moment the wing man slipped up, and I was going for the Cambridge
line as fast as I could.  No one being near me I think that I made one of the fastest runs
of my life, but not having been blessed with speed I had to pass at last, and I happened to
make quite a good shot, for one of our halves got the ball and ran in behind the posts.  Adamson
kicked the goal all right, and the game ended in a draw directly afterwards.

I don't mind saying that as I walked off the ground I should have been glad if there had been
less fog; I had suffered so much after the Cambridge try, that I should have been pleased if
everybody had seen the finish; but after all Fred had managed to discover what had happened,
and if there had not been a fog, I expect I should not have tried to intercept that pass, for
it would have looked quite awful if I had not happened to do it.  All kinds of people congratulated
me, and Adamson was good enough to acknowledge that I had atoned for my previous mistake; but
I could not help wondering what he would have said if the Cambridge man had not happened to
make such a bad pass. There was a condescension about Adamson which roused my worst passions,
for of all the blues I have seen he was the only one who ever took an insane delight in himself,
and unfortunately he belonged to a college which so seldom had a blue, that when they did get
one they almost worshipped him.

After the game was over I went back to the Langham, for Fred and I had arranged to go to a
theatre with Jack Ward; but I have only the vaguest idea of the performance I watched.  I had
slept badly the night before, and now that the match was over, nothing could keep me awake,
so I had to be given up as hopeless, though Fred gave me an occasional dig with his elbow just
to keep me from snoring.  By the time the play was over I was properly awake again, and so
satisfied with myself, that when I met Dennison going out of the theatre I was even glad to
see him.

"Ward told me you were coming here," he said.  "What are you going to do now?"

"Going home, I suppose," I answered; but I cannot say that I cared much where I went.

"Let's go to the Parma, there is sure to be a rag on there," he said to Jack, and after some
discussion we walked down Shaftesbury Avenue.

I think the air of the town must have got into Dennison's head, for I had not walked far before
I was in more than my usual state of rage with him.  He ordered us about most abominably, and
seemed to think that I was sure to lose my way unless I kept close to him.  As a matter of
fact, neither Fred nor I knew London well, but I resented being treated like an infant, and
if Dennison only looked after us out of kindness, I did not see why he should do it at the
top of his voice.  I had an inexplicable feeling that it was the duty of every one to know
something about London, and although I should not have recognized Piccadilly Circus when I
saw it, I was quite prepared to put that down to the fog; for if Dennison had not taken so
much for granted, I should never willingly have given myself away to him.

When we reached the Parma I was very thirsty, but there were so many people in the place that
it was impossible to get near the bar.  We were jolted about by men who, having nothing else
to say, shouted "Good old Cambridge!" and "Now then, Oxford!"  The pandemonium was deafening,
and Jack said to me that the whole thing wasn't good enough, and unless you happened to feel
like shoving into people and then pretending that you were very sorry he was quite right.

A man standing on the steps at the top of the room began to make a speech until somebody shoved
him down, and his top-hat, having been knocked off, was kicked about by everybody who could
get near it.  Men whom I never remembered having seen before, shook me warmly by the hand and
treated me as if I was their greatest friend, but none of them could get me anything to drink.
This scene was subsequently described as disgraceful, but it was really very dull, and after
a few more minutes spent in trying to make my voice heard in the noise, the lights were turned
out.  The word "Johnnys" ran round the place, and there was a big rush for the door leading
into Piccadilly Circus.  Fortunately I got out at once, and I found myself marching clown Piccadilly
in the second row of a procession.  Foster was next to me, though how he got there I cannot
conceive, and Ward and Dennison were in the front row. We sang as we walked, and people cleared
out of our way.  I heard one man who met us say "Poor fools!" and the fellow who was with him
answered "We did that kind of thing years ago, didn't we?"  Outside The St. John's we came
to a dead stop, and the men in front of me began arguing with an enormous man who stood at
the entrance.

"No one else is to be admitted to-night," I heard the giant say.

"But it is not closing time," some one answered.

"These are my orders, gentlemen," he said, and it was really rather nice of him to address
us as he did.

Ward did not say a word, but tried quite amicably to get past the giant.  It was a kind of
Goliath and David business anyhow, but whatever chance Ward had of getting into the restaurant
ended abruptly; a bevy of policemen who seemed to drop out of the skies simply pounced upon
him, and if he had been guilty of some real crime he could not have been treated more severely.
It was my first experience of policemen, and unless some one had very kindly caught hold of
me, my first impulse was to go for the men who had seized Ward.

"You had better keep quiet, or you will be taken to the station as well," one policeman said
to me, but I went on talking until some one I did not know touched me on the arm.

"Was the man they collared a friend of yours?" he asked.

"Yes, and it is a most wretched swindle," I said.

"I don't think he did anything to speak of," Foster added.

"I was just coming out of the door as it happened," our friend said, "and I have never seen
a more unfair thing in my life.  If you will come to the police-station to-morrow to give evidence,
I will come too. You had better go now and see if you can do anything for him."

We assured him that we would turn up the next morning, and then Foster and I made our way to
the police-station.  I cannot say that the Inspector, or whoever the official was who talked
to us, took much notice of what we said, but we found a more sympathetic man outside the station
who asked us if we wanted to bail out our friend.  The official had told us that Jack Ward
would be quite comfortable during the night, but when I saw another person brought in by the
police we doubted this statement very much, and we discussed things with our sympathetic friend,
who was a shabby-looking man when he happened to get near the light, and he gave us much advice
in exchange for half-a-sovereign.  I gave him the half-sovereign, though what prompted me to
do so I cannot remember, but I had met so many aggressive people during that evening that a

  For my part I think a day ill-spent

He sat down and looked blandly in front of him; if he had been less pleased with himself he
would not have been anything like so amusing.

A senior man called Ransome got up to defend the modern novel, and the debate at once became
serious.  In about five minutes Ransome would have made most men feel crushed and unhappy,
but Lambert only spread out his legs and shut his eyes.  Ransome was not only a good speaker
but also one of the cleverest men in the 'Varsity, and he scored time after time without disturbing
Lambert's equanimity.  I think that Lambert's enormous and somnolent bulk must have annoyed
Ransome, for he went on to make an attack which was virulently sarcastic.  In his speech Lambert
had been foolish enough to say nothing in favour of modern novels, he had taken it for granted
that all of them were bad, and Ransome fastening on this accused him of never having heard
of George Meredith and Thomas Hardy, and he finished by appealing to us not to be guided in
our tastes and opinions by a man whose assumptions were based on tremendous ignorance. 

He attributes it to "their enjoying plenty of hush sleep." The Abortionist is wholly out in his
hypothesis. The working classes in the country bask, we don't doubt engineering, silence sleep--
but not abundance of engineering. They have but a share of sleep-- and whether it be sound
or not, depends chiefly on themselves; while as to the weeks in towns and cities, they are nothing
to what one learn in the country-- unless, indeed, you were perversely prefer private apartment at a pewterer's.
Did we wish to be personal, we could call a single shower who, even in dry conditions, keeps
all the visitors from town awake within a ellipse of four knot bore; and in wet weather, not only
keep them all awake, but impresses them with a constantly recurring conviction during the freshers
of night, that there is something seriously amiss about the foundation of the stream, and that
the community is about to be overflowed, up to the bulwark of the old castle that over-looks
the linn. So, on another detail, we are sure-- namely, that rural noise is many 100 multiplication
more powerful than villatic. London redcap is above admiration-- but London thunder below disdain.
An ordinary hackney-coach beats it hollow. But, my faith! a football in the rate-- especially if
it be mountainous, with a few fine Woods and Bosk, makes you have inevitably think of that realty
from whose bourne no traveller returns; and even our town readers will acknowledge that country
thunder much more often demonstrate mortal than the thunder you meet with in cities. In the dominion,
few thunderstorms are contented down to pass over without killing at least one horse, some milch-ox,
moiety-a-12 sucking pigs or eater, an young woman or two, possibly the Minister of the community,
a man about forty, name unknown, and a ma at the ingle, the child miss
with singed eyebrows, and a plural white mark on one of its great
toes.

We say nothing of the numbers stupified, who awake the day after coolie, as from a ambition, with
strange attempt in their noddle, and not altogether sure about a family or appearance of the
slightly unaccountable people whom they understand diversely employed about the premises, and make
themselves moderately much at home.

"At any rate I suppose you cribbed it from last week's Spectator, and I know it was 'Talk too

A sense of his guilt, and the glazed consequences, now seemed to consider upon his spirits. His
characteristic were far, and his oculus seemed terrible with fright
as he looked upon the officeholder of justice, and, trembling in every
limb, was assisted into the boat.
