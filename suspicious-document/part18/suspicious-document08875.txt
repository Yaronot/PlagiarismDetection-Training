5. FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY ARE HOME VIRTUES, without which no household can prosper. Dr. Johnson
says: "Frugality may be termed the daughter of Prudence, the sister of Temperance, and the
parent of Liberty. He that is extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce
dependence and invite corruption." The necessity of practising economy should be evident to
every one, whether in the possession of an income no more than sufficient for a family's requirements,
or of a large fortune, which puts financial adversity out of the question. We must always remember
that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a little well. "He is a good waggoner,"
says Bishop Hall, "that can turn in a little room. To live well in abundance is the praise
of the estate, not of the person. I will study more how to give a good account of my little,
than how to make it more." In this there is true wisdom, and it may be added, that those who
can manage a little well, are most likely to succeed in their management of larger matters.
Economy and frugality must never, however, be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and meanness.

6. THE CHOICE OF ACQUAINTANCES is very important to the happiness of a mistress and her family.
A gossiping acquaintance, who indulges in the scandal and ridicule of her neighbours, should
be avoided as a pestilence. It is likewise all-necessary to beware, as Thomson sings,

                                 "The whisper'd tale,
  That, like the fabling Nile, no fountain knows;--
  Fair-laced Deceit, whose wily, conscious aye
  Ne'er looks direct; the tongue that licks the dust
  But, when it safely dares, as prompt to sting."

If the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a mistress, society should
be formed of such a kind as will tend to the mutual interchange of general and interesting
information.

7. FRIENDSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE HASTILY FORMED, nor the heart given, at once, to every new-comer.
There are ladies who uniformly smile at, and approve everything and everybody, and who possess
neither the courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to defend virtue. The friendship
of such persons is without attachment, and their love without affection or even preference.
They imagine that every one who has any penetration is ill-natured, and look coldly on a discriminating
judgment. It should be remembered, however, that this discernment does not always proceed from
an uncharitable temper, but that those who possess a long experience and thorough knowledge
of the world, scrutinize the conduct and dispositions of people before they trust themselves
to the first fair appearances. And Joanna Baillie tells us that

  "Friendship is no plant of hasty growth,
   Though planted in esteem's deep-fixed soil,
   The gradual culture of kind intercourse
   Must bring it to perfection."

8. HOSPITALITY IS A MOST EXCELLENT VIRTUE; but care must be taken that the love of company,
for its own sake, does not become a prevailing passion; for then the habit is no longer hospitality,
but dissipation. With respect to the continuance of friendships, however, it may be found necessary,
in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a household,
many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life. This will be the more requisite, if
the number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities.

9. IN CONVERSATION, TRIFLING OCCURRENCES, such as small disappointments, petty annoyances,
and other every-day incidents, should never be mentioned to your friends. The extreme injudiciousness
of repeating these will be at once apparent, when we reflect on the unsatisfactory discussions
which they too frequently occasion, and on the load of advice which they are the cause of being
tendered, and which is, too often, of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable. Greater events,
whether of joy or sorrow, should be communicated to friends; and, on such occasions, their
sympathy gratifies and comforts. If the mistress be a wife, never let an account of her husband's
failings pass her lips; and in cultivating the power of conversation, she should keep the versified
advice of Cowper continually in her memory, that it

  "Should flow like water after summer showers,
   Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers."

In reference to its style, Dr. Johnson, who was himself greatly distinguished for his colloquial
abilities, says that "no style is more extensively acceptable than the narrative, because this
does not carry an air of superiority over the rest of the company; and, therefore, is most
likely to please them. For this purpose we should store our memory with short anecdotes and
entertaining pieces of history. Almost every one listens with eagerness to extemporary history.
Vanity often co-operates with curiosity; for he that is a hearer in one place wishes to qualify
himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company; and therefore more attention is
given to narrations than anything else in conversation. It is true, indeed, that sallies of
wit and quick replies are very pleasing in conversation; but they frequently tend to raise
envy in some of the company: but the narrative way neither raises this, nor any other evil
passion, but keeps all the company nearly upon an equality, and, if judiciously managed, will
at once entertain and improve them all."

10. GOOD TEMPER SHOULD BE CULTIVATED by every mistress, as upon it the welfare of the household
may be said to turn; indeed, its influence can hardly be over-estimated, as it has the effect
of moulding the characters of those around her, and of acting most beneficially on the happiness
of the domestic circle. Every head of a household should strive to be cheerful, and should
never fail to show a deep interest in all that appertains to the well-being of those who claim
the protection of her roof. Leaf xv (Commencement): the kōri'(day prefecture) did not have another

 The writer there says, "Let
people write, talk, lecture, satirize, as they may, it cannot be denied that, whatever is the
prevailing mode in attire, let it intrinsically be ever so absurd, it will never look as ridiculous
as another, or as any other, which, however convenient, comfortable, or even becoming, is totally
opposite in style to that generally worn."

12. IN PURCHASING ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL, whether it be a silk dress, a bonnet, shawl,
or riband, it is well for the buyer to consider three things: I. That it be not too expensive
for her purse. II. That its colour harmonize with her complexion, and its size and pattern
with her figure. III. That its tint allow of its being worn with the other garments she possesses.
The quaint Fuller observes, that the good wife is none of our dainty dames, who love to appear
in a variety of suits every day new, as if a gown, like a stratagem in war, were to be used
but once. But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her husband's estate; and,
if of high parentage, she doth not so remember what she was by birth, that she forgets what
she is by match.

    To Brunettes, or those ladies having dark complexions, silks
    of a grave hue are adapted. For Blondes, or those having fair
    complexions, lighter colours are preferable, as the richer,
    deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter. The colours
    which go best together are green with violet; gold-colour with
    dark crimson or lilac; pale blue with scarlet; pink with black
    or white; and gray with scarlet or pink. A cold colour generally
    requires a warm tint to give life to it. Gray and pale blue, for
    instance, do not combine well, both being cold colours.

13. THE DRESS OF THE MISTRESS should always be adapted to her circumstances, and be varied
with different occasions. Thus, at breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple
manner, wearing no ornaments. If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the breakfast-hour,
and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as usually follow that meal, then it
would be well to exchange it before the time for receiving visitors, if the mistress be in
the habit of doing so. It is still to be remembered, however, that, in changing the dress,
jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress for dinner is assumed. Further
information and hints on the subject of the toilet will appear under the department of the
"LADY'S-MAID."

14. CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE ARE DUTIES which a mistress owes to herself as well as to her fellow-creatures;
and there is scarcely any income so small, but something may be spared from it, even if it
be but "the widow's mite." It is to be always remembered, however, that it is the spirit of
charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amount, and is by far its better
part.

  True Charity, a plant divinely nursed,
  Fed by the love from which it rose at first,
  Thrives against hope, and, in the rudest scene,
  Storms but enliven its unfading green;
  Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies,
  Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies.

    Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really
    to understand the actual state of each family; and although
    there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the
    metropolis and other large cities, yet in country towns and
    rural districts these objections do not obtain. Great advantages
    may result from visits paid to the poor; for there being,
    unfortunately, much ignorance, generally, amongst them with
    respect to all household knowledge, there will be opportunities
    for advising and instructing them, in a pleasant and unobtrusive
    manner, in cleanliness, industry, cookery, and good management.

15. IN MARKETING, THAT THE BEST ARTICLES ARE THE CHEAPEST, may be laid down as a rule; and
it is desirable, unless an experienced and confidential housekeeper be kept, that the mistress
should herself purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house. If the mistress be
a young wife, and not accustomed to order "things for the house," a little practice and experience
will soon teach her who are the best tradespeople to deal with, and what are the best provisions
to buy. Under each particular head of FISH, MEAT, POULTRY, GAME, &c., will be described the
proper means of ascertaining the quality of these comestibles.

16. A HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNT-BOOK should invariably be kept, and kept punctually and precisely. Their index:
SUBJECT for's'there was mis-spelled, manifested in source, do it corrected it will do. Communication:
It Cannot-yo-metal'was not any-import, column there are manifested intrinsically be let from
book, so will be refine. Happiness: entry buraku'was mis-worn, let from source, do her rectify. Scale:
construction Cannot-no-an-no-kami children-spelled, denied.'Index: fashion Children-kō U-cannot'did
not have that it, are so be edited for the entry delights.
 The housekeeping accounts should
be balanced not less than once a month; so that you may see that the money you have in hand
tallies with your account of it in your diary. Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than
when he said, "No man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means, and no one is poor whose
incomings exceed his outgoings."

    When, in a large establishment, a housekeeper is kept, it will
    be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly.
    Then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent, can
    easily be explained, and the housekeeper will have the
    satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her
    department well and economically, have been successful.

17. ENGAGING DOMESTICS is one of those duties in which the judgment of the mistress must be
keenly exercised. There are some respectable registry-offices, where good servants may sometimes
be hired; but the plan rather to be recommended is, for the mistress to make inquiry amongst
her circle of friends and acquaintances, and her tradespeople. The latter generally know those
in their neighbourhood, who are wanting situations, and will communicate with them, when a
personal interview with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the characters
of the applicants, and to suit herself accordingly.

    We would here point out an error--and a grave one it is--into
    which some mistresses fall. They do not, when engaging a
    servant, expressly tell her all the duties which she will be
    expected to perform. This is an act of omission severely to be
    reprehended. Every portion of work which the maid will have to
    do, should be plainly stated by the mistress, and understood by
    the servant. If this plan is not carefully adhered to, domestic
    contention is almost certain to ensue, and this may not be
    easily settled; so that a change of servants, which is so much
    to be deprecated, is continually occurring.

18. IN OBTAINING A SERVANT'S CHARACTER, it is not well to be guided by a written one from some
unknown quarter; but it is better to have an interview, if at all possible, with the former
mistress. By this means you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant
for your place, from the appearance of the lady and the state of her house. Negligence and
want of cleanliness in her and her household generally, will naturally lead you to the conclusion,
that her servant has suffered from the influence of the bad example.

    The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal
    interview with the lady is this:--The servant in search of the
    situation must be desired to see her former mistress, and ask
    her to be kind enough to appoint a time, convenient to herself,
    when you may call on her; this proper observance of courtesy
    being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the
    part of a stranger. Your first questions should be relative to
    the honesty and general morality of her former servant; and if
    no objection is stated in that respect, her other qualifications
    are then to be ascertained. Inquiries should be very minute, so
    that you may avoid disappointment and trouble, by knowing the
    weak points of your domestic.

19. THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS is of the highest possible moment, as well to the mistress as
to the domestics themselves. On the head of the house the latter will naturally fix their attention;
and if they perceive that the mistress's conduct is regulated by high and correct principles,
they will not fail to respect her. If, also, a benevolent desire is shown to promote their
comfort, at the same time that a steady performance of their duty is exacted, then their respect
will not be unmingled with affection, and they will be still more solicitous to continue to
deserve her favour.
