INTRODUCTION.

The worship of the sanctuary is a living subject of discussion and practice in the Presbyterian
Churches of the world at large, and, within late years, in that of the Canadian Dominion. 
Many earnest minds are approaching the study of the subject from various standpoints, each
worthy of attentive consideration.  One regards it from the dogmatic position of scriptural
precedent, or from the larger one of Christian principle; the aesthetic mind comes to it with
visions of order and beauty; the practical, with his view of the Church's needs in mission
fields and in mixed congregations.  There is room in the discussion for the largest statement
of lawful opinion, founded on conviction of absolute right, and on Christian expediency, and
for the exercise of abundant charity.

Dr. Johnston gives no uncertain sound on the subject.  To his mind the duty of the Church,
first and last, is to preserve spirituality of worship, and to discountenance everything that
may tend to interfere with the same.  But, while this spirit pervades his work, his method
is historical, and thus preeminently fair and impartial in statement. The presentation of the
argument in concrete or historical form invests it with an interest which could hardly be commanded
by either dogmatic or practical methods, while it excludes neither.

Dr. Johnston brings to his task ripe scholarship, including extensive knowledge of Church history
and ecclesiology, his proficiency in which he has recently vindicated in such a manner as to
leave no room for doubt. To this he adds the teaching of pastoral experience in mission fields,
prior to his ordination, and, since then, in large and influential congregations; and, to crown
the whole, heartfelt devotion to the Church of his fathers, and unswerving personal loyalty
to its King and Head.

With adoring thanks to the great Teacher of us all, who rewards professors in their declining
years with the affectionate regard of their whilom best students, now become wise and strong
men in the Church's service, I cordially commend to all who may read these words, this outcome
of Dr. Johnston's Christian erudition and conscientious literary labor.

The revision, however, was never accomplished, Henderson confessing, according to the historian,
Baillie, that he could not take upon him "either to determine some points controverted, or
to set down other forms of prayer than we have in our Psalm Book, penned by our great and divine
reformer."

A book which held for so long a time its place of authority in the Scottish Church, and which
embodied during so important a period the law of the Church concerning worship, deserves particular
study at the hands of those who are interested in the history of this important subject, but
inasmuch as the form of worship alone is under discussion, it will be necessary to refer only
to those parts of it which bear on this phase of the Church's practice.  Before doing so, however,
it will be instructive to notice what is too frequently overlooked, that the adoption of Knox's
Book of Common Order by the Scottish Church indicates even in that age a desire for forms of
worship less liturgical than those which were employed by other parts of the Reformed Church.
It is to be remembered that those parishes in which the Reformed religion prevailed had been
accustomed to the use of the English Book of Common Prayer with responsive services for the
people, and with prayers from which the minister was not supposed to deviate. This Book was
set aside, and in its place was adopted an Order of worship in no part of which provision was
made for responses, and in all of whose prayers the minister was not only allowed freedom,
but was encouraged to exercise the same.  Such action on the part of men accustomed to make
changes only after careful deliberation, clearly indicates an intelligent choice of a non-liturgical
service as opposed to one of the opposite character.

More than this, the Scottish Book of Common Order is marked by an even greater freedom from
prescribed forms than is Calvin's original Book of Geneva from which Knox copied so largely.
For while both of them agreed in avoiding a responsive service, Knox seems to have been even
less than Calvin in sympathy with prescribed forms of prayer from which no deviation was to
be allowed.  There is nothing to indicate that Knox would have agreed with the sentiment expressed
in Calvin's letter to the Protector Somerset, in which he says: "As to what concerns a form
of prayer and ecclesiastical rites, I highly approve of it, that there be a certain form from
which the ministers be not allowed to vary.... Therefore there ought to be a stated form of
prayer and administration of the Sacraments."  The form of Church prayers, as originally prepared
by Calvin in keeping with his sentiments above expressed, do not provide for any variation
in certain parts of the service. In Divines of S so it speed it was of which was the intention
of all. The was either dangerous claimed first land; the wait; but it practise it was of rule

In this matter, however, permission was granted to congregations to use their discretion; Knox,
we know, preached a sermon after the burial of the Regent Moray, and the directions in the
Book of Common Order clearly leave much to be determined by the circumstances of the case:

"The corpse is reverently brought to the grave accompanied with the Congregation without any
further ceremonies: which being buried, the Minister, if he be present and required, goeth
to the Church, if it be not far off, and maketh some comfortable exhortation to the people
touching death and resurrection; then blesseth the people and so dismisseth them."

This is but one of many instances that show that the early reformers accorded to the Church,
in matters not absolutely essential to the preservation of sound doctrine and Scriptural practice,
the greatest liberty.  With regard to the administration of the Sacraments and the public worship
of God, they laid down well-defined regulations and outlines to which conformity was required;
in matters that might be looked upon as simply edifying and profitable, liberty was allowed
to ministers and congregations to determine according to their discretion, as Knox himself
declared with respect to exercises of worship at burials:

"We are not so precise but that we are content that particular Kirks use them in that behalf,
with the consent of the ministry of the same as they will answer to God and Assembly of the
Universal Kirk gathered within the realm."

We have thus presented in brief outline the contents of the Book of Common Order, commonly
used in Scotland from 1562 to 1645, in so far as its regulations refer to public worship and
the administration of the Sacraments.  The book is itself so simple and clear in its statements
that it is not difficult to discover the spirit of its compilers, and their understanding of
what was required for the seemly and Scriptural observance of the different parts of Divine
worship.  The results of our survey may be summed up in a few words.

The Scottish Church gave a prominent place to prayer, to the reading of Holy Scripture, and
to praise, in the public worship of God on the Lord's Day.  Not in any sense do these exercises
seem to have been regarded as subordinate in importance to the preaching of the Word; the congregations
assembled for Divine worship, of which preaching was one important part.  But even where there
was no preaching, the people nevertheless came together for Divine worship, in which they were
led, in the absence of any minister, by persons duly appointed for that purpose.

The service in public worship was not in any of its departments a responsive one.  The only
audible part shared by the people was in the praise; they did not respond in prayer even to
the extent of uttering an audible "Amen," nor did they join audibly in any general confession,
in a declaration of faith as contained in the Apostles' Creed or in any other formulary, nor
did they even repeat with the minister the Lord's Prayer when that model of prayer given by
Christ to His disciples was used in public worship.

Liberty under the guidance of the Holy Spirit marked the minister's use of the forms provided,
and the privilege of extempore prayer was sacredly guarded, the example of Knox, as well as
his precept, encouraging his brethren in the ministry to cultivate free and unrestricted prayer
to God.  In this matter the Church declared her belief in the Holy Ghost and in His presence
with her, believing that those who were divinely called to the work of the ministry were by
the Spirit of God duly equipped for the performance of the important duties of that office.
Although forms of prayer were provided, these appear to have been intended mainly for the use
of the Readers, who were not duly ordained to the ministerial office, and for the guidance
of ministers, but IN NO PART OF PUBLIC WORSHIP APART FROM THE SACRAMENTS WAS THE MINISTER CONFINED
TO THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FORMS.  Even the Readers enjoyed a degree of liberty in this matter,
a liberty which they exercised, as is evident from an Order of Assembly passed in the reign
of James forbidding Readers to offer extemporary prayers, but requiring them to use the forms
prescribed.

Lastly, in the administration of the Sacraments honor was put upon them by the care that was
observed in their public, reverent and frequent observance.  Simplicity marked all the service
connected with these holy ordinances, while, at the same time, whatever might appear to unduly
exalt them to an unscriptural position in the thoughts of men, was carefully avoided, as well
in the prayers and exhortations used as in the manner of administration.  The Sacraments were
regarded as helps to the spiritual life of God's elect, as "medicine for the spiritually sick,"
and were never represented as holy mysteries into which only certain of God's children should
penetrate.

If these conclusions are just, it is very evident that those who to-day advocate the introduction
into Presbyterian worship of responses and prescribed forms can find no support for such a
practice, however they might limit it, in Knox's Book of Common Order, or in the practice of
our Scottish ancestors in this so virile and vigorous period of the Church's history.  Just
as little support, too, can those find who would impose upon the ministry of the Church the
use of set forms from which no deviation is to be allowed either in the conduct of public worship
or in the administration of the Sacraments.  The most that can be argued from this ancient
regulation of worship, which is much more accurately described as a Directory rather than as
a Liturgy, is the desirability of a uniform order of service for the whole Church, of a due
proportion of attention to each part of worship, and of the conformity by all ministers to
a uniform method in the administration of the Sacraments.  The Book of Common Order clearly
indicates the conviction of the Scottish reformers that all things in connection with the worship
of God should be done "in seemly form and according to order," and it quite as clearly indicates
their purpose to acknowledge and rely upon the operation of the free Spirit of God, in the
exercise of that worship and in the performance of the public ordinances in the sanctuary.

A Diet of Public Worship in the Time of Knox.

Chapter IV.

A Diet of Public Worship in the Time of Knox.

A diet of worship on a Sabbath day in Scotland in the days of Knox, or in the period immediately
succeeding his death, had for the people of that time a profound interest.  It was a period
of storm and upheaval, and the Church, with its worship and teaching, was the centre around
which, in large measure, the struggles of the age gathered; and although for us these struggles
are simple history, and the subjects of debate are, many of them, forever laid aside, still
it is of interest to learn how a service in connection with the public worship of the day proceeded
in this formative period of Presbyterian practice, when order and method were less matters
of indifference than they are now.

 History has left but little doubt
in the mind of the careful student that Laud's deliberate purpose and persistent influence,
both in England and in Scotland, were towards a revival of Romanism within the Church of which
he was a prelate, or at least towards the creation of a high Anglicanism which would differ
but little from the Romish system. Adroitly, and frequently concealing his real purpose, he
labored to this end, and it is not too much to say that the vigorous and, at last, successful
opposition to his plans in Scotland, saved the English Church from radical changes which it
is clear he was prepared to introduce in the southern Kingdom when his desires for Scotland
had been effected.  England owes to Scotland the preservation of her Protestantism on two occasions:
first, in the days of Knox, when the work of the sturdy Reformer prevented what must have taken
place had a Catholic Scotland been prepared to join with Spain in the overthrow of Protestant
England, and again when Scottish opposition effectively nipped in the bud Laud's plans for
a Romish movement in both Kingdoms.

The history of the movement under Laud it is only possible briefly to summarize.  In 1629 Charles
revived the subject, to which his father had devoted so much attention, of an improved service
in the Church of Scotland, and wrote to the Scottish Bishops ordering them to press forward
the matter of an improved liturgy with all earnestness.  As a result, the draft of the Book
of Common Prayer prepared in the reign of James was again brought to light and forwarded to
Charles, and this would probably have been accepted and authorized for use but for Laud's influence.
It however was too bald and simple to suit the ritualistic Archbishop, who persuaded the King
that it would be entirely preferable to introduce into Scotland the English Prayer Book without
change. Correspondence upon the matter was continued until 1633, when Charles, accompanied
by Laud, visited Scotland for the purpose of being crowned, and also "to finish the important
business of the Liturgy."

During his stay in Scotland Charles followed the example of his father in parading before the
people upon every possible occasion the ritual of the Church of England, conduct on his part
which served only to stir up further and more deeply-seated opposition. Well at 9: 30 the preacher,

This feeling of opposition on the part of the people to the introduction of a liturgy into
the Church of Scotland, found due and official expression in the following year.  The General

Common Order as containing the Law of the Church respecting worship. SALEM, October had 22, 1832. [the

The liberty of free prayer so dear to the Scottish reformers was, if not entirely denied, largely
encroached upon; a responsive service, to which, in common with the great leaders of Geneva,
Knox and Melville had been so uniformly opposed, was introduced; and particularly in the service
for the administration of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, forms of words were employed
which seemed to teach doctrines rejected by the reformers.  Here then was abundant ground for
opposition to Laud's liturgy when judged on its merits, and this ground the stern theologians
of that day were not likely to overlook.

Nor is it to be forgotten that in the many supplications which from time to time were presented
to the King both from Church and State against the introduction of the Service Book, the anti-English
plea never found a place, but uniformly, reference was made in strong terms to the unscriptural
form of worship suggested for adoption by the Scottish people, together with a protest against
the arrogant imposition upon them of a form of service not desired.  Persistently in these
supplications the subscribers expressed their desire that there should be no change in the
form of worship to which they had been accustomed, and prayed for a continuance of the liberty
hitherto enjoyed.  In a complaint laid before the Privy Council the Service Book and Canons
are described as "containing the seeds of divers superstitions, idolatry and false doctrine,"
and as being "subversive of the discipline established in the Church."  The Earl of Rothes
in an address spoke thus: "Who pressed that form of service contrary to the laws of God and
this kingdom?  Who dared in their conventicles contrive a form of God's public worship contrary
to that established by the general consent of this Church and State?"  And that the form of
worship ever held a prominent place in the discussions of the time, appears from a letter supposed
to have been written by Alexander Henderson, in which he defends the Presbyterian Church against
a charge of disorder and neglect of seemly procedure in worship; he says, "The form of prayers,
administration of the Sacraments, etc., which are set down before their Psalm Book, and to
which the ministers are to conform themselves, is a sufficient witness; for although they be
not tied to set forms and words, yet are they not left at random, but for testifying their
consent and keeping unity they have their Directory and prescribed Order."

While it is true, therefore, that the high-handed conduct of the King in forcing upon an unwilling
people a form of service already distasteful because of its foreign associations, was doubtless
an important element in arousing the vigorous opposition with which it was met, nevertheless,
there is abundant evidence to show that apart from any such consideration, the spirit of the
Church of Scotland was entirely hostile to the introduction of further forms, to the elaboration
of their simple service, and to the imposition upon their ministers of prescribed prayers from
which in public worship they would not be allowed to depart.

The Westminster Assembly and the Directory of Worship.

If the Assembly's Directory increased liberty, it also augmented responsibility.  If it took
away the support of set and prescribed forms on which the indolent might lean and even sleep,
this was done to the avowed intent that those who conducted public services might the more
industriously prepare for them; and thereunto the more diligently stir up the gifts of God
within them.--REV. EUGENE DANIEL.

Chapter VI.

The Westminster Assembly and the Directory of Worship.

Prior to the year 1638 the Church of Scotland, in its struggle to preserve its form of worship,
had to contend with the advocates of prelacy and ritualism, but now opposition to the established
practice arose from another quarter.

In connection with every great reform there are apt to arise extravagant movements, the promoters
of which see only one side of confessedly important truths, and so carry to undue excess some
phase of reform which, in properly balanced measure, would have been righteous and desirable.
So it was in the period of the Reformation. Among the several sectaries which had their origin
in the Reformed Church was a company called Brownists, an extreme section of the Independents,
who took their name from their founder, one Robert Browne, an Englishman and a preacher, although
a rejecter of ordination and a protester against the necessity of any official license for
the work of the ministry. Domicile, metal. As we pull near Scotland, "hard pedaled" their people,

  They had found a ritualistic worship associated with practices which they could not
but judge to be ungodly and unjust, and engaged in by men who made much of form, but little
of truth and charity and justice.  It is not surprising, therefore, that in their desire for
a revived spiritual life in the Church they should consider such a life to be most effectively
forwarded by a departure from those forms that had been associated with the decay of true religion
in their midst.

But, in the second place, this sentiment in favor of absolute freedom from form was not confined
to sectaries or their sympathizers in the Church, it made itself manifest among the leaders
of religion in the land and in the Church courts.  The proposal of the General Assembly of
1643 to prepare a Directory of Worship, and the subsequent action of the Scottish Church in
uniting with the Westminster Divines in the preparation of that Directory, clearly indicate
that the Church had changed its attitude since the day in which the Assembly refused to alter
any of the prayers in the Book of Common Order. Patmore has been yet has been print as the cover "was

  Every succeeding period in her history, whether we judge from the general spirit characterizing
the people or from the official acts of the Parliament and the Church, shows a growing distaste
for a liturgical worship and an increasing appreciation of liberty in all matters pertaining
to the approach of the soul to God.  The Church of Scotland rejected, on the one hand, the
extreme positions of sectaries who condemned alike a combined system of Church government,
the celebration of marriage in the Church, the use in worship of the Lord's Prayer and all
regulations even of the order of Divine worship, and on the other hand it resisted successfully
the strongest Anglican influences which would have deprived it of the liberty it prized and
would have circumscribed that liberty by a ritual.  It retained dignity and order, while it
rejected both the license of extravagance and the bondage of form.

Presbyterian Worship Outside of the Established Church of Scotland.

Whether they were right or wrong ... no man of fairness will fail to allow that the record
of the Seceders all through the period of decadence was a noble one, a record of splendid service
to the cause of Christ and the historic Church of Scotland.--M'CRIE.

Chapter VIII.

Presbyterian Worship Outside of the Established Church of Scotland.

No review of Presbyterian Worship would be complete which failed to consider the spirit which
has characterized those large sections of the Church which exist in Scotland outside of the
Establishment, and those also which have been planted and fostered in the New World.

In 1733 the first Secession Church was formed, when Ebenezer Erskine, William Wilson, Alexander
Moncrieff, and James Fisher, protesting against what they regarded as the unjust treatment
accorded them by the prevailing party in the Church, were declared to be no longer members
of the Church of Scotland.  This Secession Church enjoyed a rapid growth, and soon came to
form a very influential section in the Presbyterianism of the land.  Its principles and practices
with regard to worship show that same suspicion of a ritual and partiality for a free form
of worship which has always characterized the Presbyterian Church in the days of her greatest
vigor.  In 1736 this Church published its judicial testimony, in which it declared its loyalty
to the Directory of Worship as the same was approved by the Assembly of 1645.  Some years later
one section of this Church, known as the Antiburgher, published a condemnation of the corruptions
of worship as witnessed in England and Wales, and at a subsequent period a further manifesto,
in which the reading by ministers of their sermons in the public ministry of the Word was condemned,
as was also "the conduct of those adult persons who, in ordinary circumstances, either in public,
in private, or in secret, restrict themselves to set forms of prayer, whether these be read
or repeated."  The same manifesto, in a part treating of Psalmody, claimed for the Psalms Divine
authority, as suitable for the service of praise, in the Christian as well as in the Old Testament
dispensation, but acknowledged that, in addition to these, "others contained in the New Testament
itself may be sung in the ordinance of Praise." 

Yet have it was a service if were ne'er. It is of affray could have liturgical Spirit were altered as be so.

  Orders of service are suggested,
as well for public worship as for the administration of the Sacraments and for special services,
and suggestions at great length are offered concerning what should find a place in the prayers
of Invocation, Thanksgiving, Confession, Petition, Intercession and Illumination.  A few historic
prayers of eminent saints of God are included as examples, and large quotations are made for
the same purpose from Knox's Book of Common Order and from Hermann's "Consultation," and from
this last source "A Litany for Special Days of Prayer" is added in an Appendix.  If the Euchologion
indicates a strong tendency on the part of the "Church Service Society" towards the introduction
of a responsive and liturgical service into public worship, the New Directory of Public Worship
indicates just as strongly a tendency within the "Public Worship Association" to avoid the
introduction of even optional forms and to retain the simplicity that has for three centuries
characterized Presbyterian worship.

The attempts to revise the Directory of Worship in order to modify and adapt it to present-day
requirements made recently by the Presbyterian Church of England, and by the Federated Churches
of Australia and Tasmania, have already been referred to.  That these Churches have confined
their efforts to a revision of the Directory, and have in this asserted their approval of a
Directory of Worship rather than of a liturgy, is in itself an instructive fact.

In the revised Directory of the Presbyterian Church of England some changes are made in the
direction of securing for the people a larger part in audible worship.  The repetition of the
Creed is permitted, and where used is to be repeated by the minister and people together; it
is recommended as seemly that the people after every prayer should audibly say Amen, and the
Lord's Prayer, which should be uniformly used, is to be said by all.

The work of revision by the Churches of Australia and Tasmania introduces fewer changes.  In
the administration of "The Lord's Supper" it is recommended that at the close of the Consecration
Prayer the minister recite the "Apostles Creed" as a brief summary of Christian Faith, and
when the Lord's Prayer is used, as advised before or after the prayer of intercession, the
people may be invited to join audibly or to add Amen.

Worthy of more extended notice than the limits of this chapter will permit is "The Book of
Church Order" of the Presbyterian Church in the United States.  As early as 1864 a proposal
was made in Assembly to revise the Westminster Directory of Worship for the purpose not only
of rendering it more suitable to the requirements of the time, but in order also to so modify
and improve it as to increase its suggestiveness and helpfulness to ministers.  The work was
undertaken by a committee appointed in 1879, and in 1894 this committee presented its formal
report, which was adopted, and the revised Directory was ordered to be published.  It contains
sixteen chapters, treating of all the matters treated in the original Directory, and containing
in addition suggestive chapters on "Sabbath Schools," "Prayer Meetings," "Secret and Family
Worship," and "The Admission of Persons to Sealing Ordinances."

Respecting the public reading of Holy Scripture the revised Directory declares it to be "a
part of the public worship of God," and that "it ought to be performed by the minister or some
other authorized person." I did not see him have wholly; but when i did, that i had this difficulty in

they had made by presbyterianism-- could anything have been worse if you
had not been?

It is evident from these recent and simultaneous movements in so many branches of the Presbyterian
Church, that there exists a feeling on the part of many that there is need of improvement in
the important department of worship in our public services.  It is probable that there will
be found few to deny this, or to confess absolute satisfaction with the worship of the Church
to-day. Neither would have the reservation or engage Station of same or the minister-- often

It was the shell, officers and him enlisted men would not to relinquish far approving and patronize

  Accordingly,
when it was proposed to substitute for the Book of Common Order a Directory, in which there
should appear no prescribed forms for any part of public worship, the Scotch Assembly gave
a ready assent to the proposal, and, although some words of regret at parting with an historic
symbol were spoken at that time by leaders in the Scottish Church, they were only such as it
was natural to expect should be spoken in view of the strong attachment for that symbol fostered
by its use during many years, but they were not such as indicate that those who so spoke felt
themselves called upon to surrender any principle in laying aside the order to which they had
been so long accustomed.  Indeed the hearty and cheerful adoption by the Scottish Assembly
of the strongly worded preface to the Westminster Directory, exposing as it does so vigorously
the weakness as well as the dangers resulting from the use of a liturgy in public worship,
plainly indicates that in the judgment of the Church of that day the use of liturgical forms
was not only not helpful, but was positively perilous, as well to the best interests of the
congregation as to the most efficient service of the minister. 

His swivet were some sentiment of the bosom; his facetiousness had this age. In masterly, may he was

"same hub knoweth its the time, and render the acquaintance who intermeddleth not with delight;"
or any delight or the hostility there was of more public improvement are not have intermeddled with

It is argued in favor of the introduction of forms of prayer that their use would tend to the
more orderly and dignified conducting of public worship by the minister.  It is not a difficult
matter to take exception to methods to which we have long been accustomed, and to compare these,
sometimes to their disadvantage, with ideal conditions. Nitrogen.

Mister. HAWTHORNE,-- you have show as encouragement that your oeuvre might they interest of

and mind necessary for its helpful performance, nor will his consciousness of the need of help,
other than man can give, go unrecognized by the Father of Spirits, Who in this matter also
sends not His servants at their own charges.

As to the unity in prayer so much desired, true prayer is "in the Spirit," and earnest worshippers
have a right to expect that their hearts will be united by that Spirit at the throne of grace,
so that "with one accord" they may present their petitions and claim the promise to those who
are thus agreed. Among congregations, i may have been much the repetition which compares to church

Our free and untrammeled worship demands from the worshipper his best; it brings him face to

of the minister a preparation of both mind and soul, and challenges him to spiritual conflict
which he dare not refuse, while in addition to all this its very freedom renders it adaptable
