It was not until I met General Smuts during the Great War, however, that I had a definite reason
for going there.

After these late years of blood and battle America and Europe seemed tame. Besides, the economic
war after the war developed into a struggle as bitter as the actual physical conflict. Discord
and discontent became the portion of the civilized world. I wanted to get as far as possible
from all this social unrest and financial dislocation.

So much interest was evinced in the magazine articles which first set forth the record of my
journey that I was prompted to expand them into this book. It may enable the reader to discover
a section of the one-time Dark Continent without the hardships which I experienced.

millions who come we represented to maps to Stanley, i die to River, him
radiate with associates, height probably.

 Suddenly Smuts cast his eye over the long room and saw a solitary man
just commencing his dinner in the opposite corner. Turning to me he said:

"Do you know Cresswell?"

"I was introduced to him yesterday," I replied.

"Would you mind if I asked him to dine with us?"

When I assured him that I would be delighted, the Prime Minister got up, walked over to Cresswell
and asked him to join us, which he did.

The significant part of this apparently simple performance, which had its important outcome,
was this. Colonel F. H. P. Cresswell is the leader of the Labour Party in South Africa. By
profession a mining engineer, he led the forces of revolt in the historic industrial upheaval
in the Rand in what Smuts denounced as a "Syndicalist Conspiracy." Riot, bloodshed, and confusion
reigned for a considerable period at Johannesburg and large bodies of troops had to be called
out to restore order. At the very moment that we sat down to dine that night no one knew just
what Cresswell and the Labourites with their new-won power would do. Smuts, as Minister of
Finance, had deported some of Cresswell's men and Cresswell himself narrowly escaped drastic
punishment.

When Smuts brought Cresswell over he said jokingly to me:

"Cresswell is a good fellow but I came near sending him to jail once."

Cresswell beamed and the three of us amiably discussed various topics until the gong sounded
for the assembling of the House.

What was the result? Before I left Capetown and when the first of the few occasions which tested
the real voting strength of Parliament arose, Cresswell and some of his adherents voted with
Smuts. I tell this little story to show that the man who today holds the destiny of South Africa
in his hands is as skillful a diplomat as he is soldier and statesman.

It was at one of these quiet dinners with Smuts at the House that he first spoke about Nationalism.
He said: "The war gave Nationalism its death blow. But as a matter of fact Nationalism committed
suicide in the war."

"But what is Nationalism?" I asked him.

"A water-tight nation in a water-tight compartment," he replied. "It is a process of regimentation
like the old Germany that will soon merge into a new Internationalism. What seems to be at
this moment an orgy of Nationalism in South Africa or elsewhere is merely its death gasp. The
New World will be a world of individualism dominated by Britain and America.

"What about the future?" I asked him. His answer was:

"The safety of the future depends upon Federation, upon a League of Nations that will develop
along economic and not purely sentimental lines. The New Internationalism will not stop war
but it can regulate exchange, and through this regulation can help to prevent war.

"I believe in an international currency which will be a sort of legal tender among all the
nations. Why should the currency of the country depreciate or rise with the fortunes of war
or with its industrial or other complications? Misfortune should not be penalized fiscally."

I brought up the question of the lack of accord which then existed between Britain and America
and suggested that perhaps the fall in exchange had something to do with it, whereupon he said:
"Yes, I think it has. It merely illustrates the point that I have just made about an international
currency."

We came back to the subject of individualism, which led Smuts to say:

"The Great War was a striking illustration of the difference between individualism and nationalism.
Hindenberg commanded the only army in the war. It was a product of nationalism. The individualism
of the Anglo-Saxon is such that it becomes a mob but it is an intelligent mob. Haig and Pershing
commanded such mobs."

I tried to probe Smuts about Russia. He was in London when I returned from Petrograd in 1917
and I recall that he displayed the keenest interest in what I told him about Kerensky and the
new order that I had seen in the making. I heard him speak at a Russian Fair in London. The
whole burden of his utterance was the hope that the Slav would achieve discipline and organization.
At that time Russia redeemed from autocracy looked to be a bulwark of Allied victory. The night
we talked about Russia at Capetown she had become the prey of red terror and the plaything
of organized assassination.

Smuts looked rather wistful when he said:

"You cannot defeat Russia. Napoleon learned this to his cost and so will the rest of the world.
I do not know whether Bolshevism is advancing or subsiding. There comes a time when the fiercest
fires die down. But the best way to revive or rally all Russia to the Soviet Government is
to invade the country and to annex large slices of it."

These utterances were made during those more or less hasty meals at the House of Parliament
when the Premier's mind was really in the Legislative Hall nearby where he was fighting for
his administrative life. It was far different out at Groote Schuur, the home of the Prime Minister,
located in Rondebosch, a suburb about nine miles from Capetown. In the open country that he
loves, and in an environment that breathed the romance and performance of England's greatest
empire-builder, I caught something of the man's kindling vision and realized his ripe grasp
of international events.

Groote Schuur is one of the best-known estates in the world. Cecil Rhodes in his will left
it to the Union as the permanent residence of the Prime Minister. Ever since I read the various
lives of Rhodes I had had an impatient desire to see this shrine of achievement. Here Rhodes
came to live upon his accession to the Premiership of the Cape Colony; here he fashioned the
British South Africa Company which did for Rhodesia what the East India Company did for India;
here came prince and potentate to pay him honour; here he dreamed his dreams of conquest looking
out at mountain and sea; here lived Jameson and Kipling; here his remains lay in state when
at forty-nine the fires of his restless ambition had ceased.

Groote Schuur, which in Dutch means "Great Granary," was originally built as a residence and
store-house for one of the early Dutch Governors of the Cape. It is a beautiful example of
the Dutch architecture that you will find throughout the Colony and which is not surpassed
in grace or comfort anywhere. When Rhodes acquired it in the eighties the grounds were comparatively
limited. As his power and fortune increased he bought up all the surrounding country until
today you can ride for nine miles across the estate. He was, indeed, or took his addition will be too
bewildering. Kernel did not admit the heretic has been usually led a conspicuously be blameless
life, that he was hard, did not swear, was emaciated to tepid and
refused in participate with recreations of thousands.

 He loved it for its vastness and its solitude. On the back stoep, which is the Dutch
word for porch, he sat for hours gazing at this mountain which like the man himself was invested
with a spirit of immensity.

It was a memorable experience to be at Groote Schuur with Smuts, who has lived to see the realization
of the hope of Union which thrilled always in the heart of Cecil Rhodes. I remember that on
the first night I went out the Prime Minister took me through the house himself. It has been
contended by Smuts' enemies that he was a "creature of Rhodes." I discovered that Smuts, with
the exception of having made a speech of welcome when Rhodes visited the school that he attended
as a boy, had never even met the Englishman who left his impress upon a whole land.

Groote Schuur has been described so much that it is not necessary for me to dwell upon its
charm and atmosphere here. To see it is to get a fresh and intimate realization of the personality
which made the establishment an unofficial Chancellery of the British Empire.

Two details, however, have poignant and dramatic interest. In the simple, massive, bed-room
with its huge bay window opening on Table Mountain and a stretch of lovely countryside, hangs
the small map of Africa that Rhodes marked with crimson ink and about which he made the famous
utterance, "It must be all red." Hanging on the wall in the billiard room is the flag with
Crescent and Cape device that he had made to be carried by the first locomotive to travel from
Cairo to the Cape. That flag has never been unfurled to the breeze but the vision that beheld
it waving in the heart of the jungle is soon to become an accomplished fact.

It was on a night at Groote Schuur, as I walked with Smuts through the acres of hydrangeas
and bougainvillea (Rhodes' favorite flowers), with a new moon peeping overhead that I got the
real mood of the man. Pointing to the faint silvery crescent in the sky I said: "General, there's
a new moon over us and I'm sure it means good luck for you."

"No," he replied, "it's the man that makes the luck."

He had had a trying day in the House and was silent in the motor car that brought us out. The
moment we reached the country and he sniffed the scent of the gardens the anxiety and preoccupation
fell away. He almost became boyish. But when he began to discuss great problems the lightness
vanished and he became the serious thinker.

We harked back to the days when I had first seen him in England. I asked him to tell me what
he thought of the aftermath of the stupendous struggle. He said:

"The war was just a phase of world convulsion. It made the first rent in the universal structure.
For years the trend of civilization was toward a super-Nationalism. It is easy to trace the
stages. The Holy Roman Empire was a phase of Nationalism. That was Catholic. Then came the
development of Nationalism, beginning with Napoleon. That was Protestant. Now began the building
of water-tight compartments, otherwise known as nations. Germany represented the most complete
development.

"But that era of 'my country,' 'my power,'--it is all a form of national ego,--is gone. The
four great empires,--Turkey, Germany, Russia and Austria,--have crumbled. The war jolted them
from their high estate. It started the universal cataclysm. Centuries in the future some perspective
can be had and the results appraised. 

We have in whom it mean ontology.

 He speaks with
vigour and at times not without emotion. The Boer is not a particularly demonstrative person
and Smuts has some of the racial reserve. His personality betokens potential strength,--a suggestion
of the unplumbed reserve that keeps people guessing. This applies to his mental as well as
his physical capacity. Frankly cordial, he resents familiarity. You would never think of slapping
him on the shoulder and saying, "Hello, Jan." More than one blithe and buoyant person has been
frozen into respectful silence in such a foolhardy undertaking.

His middle name is Christian and it does not belie a strong phase of his character. Without
carrying his religious convictions on his coat-sleeve, he has nevertheless a fine spiritual
strain in his make-up. He is an all-round dependable person, with an adaptability to environment
that is little short of amazing.

IV

Now let us turn to another and less conspicuous South African whose point of view, imperial,
personal and patriotic, is the exact opposite of that of Smuts. Throughout this chapter has
run the strain of Hertzog, first the Boer General fighting gallantly in the field with Smuts
as youthful comrade; then the member of the Botha Cabinet; later the bitter insurgent, and
now the implacable foe of the order that he helped to establish. What manner of man is he and
what has he to say?

I talked to him one afternoon when he left the floor leadership to his chief lieutenant, a
son of the late President Steyn of the Orange Free State. Like his father, who called himself
"President" to the end of his life although his little republic had slipped away from him,
he has never really yielded to English rule.

We adjourned to the smoking room where we had the inevitable cup of South African coffee. I
was prepared to find a fanatic and fire-eater. Instead I faced a thin, undersized man who looked
anything but a general and statesman. Put him against the background of a small New England
town and you would take him for an American country lawyer. He resembles the student more than
the soldier and, like many Boers, speaks English with a British accent. Nor is he without force.
No man can play the rôle that he has played in South Africa those past twenty-five years without
having substance in him.

When I asked him to state his case he said:

"The republican idea is as old as South Africa. There was a republic before the British arrived.
The idea came from the American Revolution and the inspiration was Washington. The Great Trek
of 1836 was a protest very much like the one we are making today.

"President Wilson articulated the Boer feeling with his gospel of self-determination. He also
voiced the aspirations of Ireland, India and Egypt. It is a great world idea--a deep moral
conviction of mankind, this right of the individual state, as of the individual for freedom.

"Never again will Transvaal and Orange Free State history be repeated. No matter how a nation
covets another--and I refer to British covetousness,--if the nation coveted is able to govern
itself it cannot and must not be assimilated. It is one result of the Great War."

"What is the Nationalist ideal?" I asked.

"It is the right to self-rule," replied Hertzog. "But there must be no conflict if it can be
avoided. It must prevail by reason and education. At the present time I admit that the majority
of South Africans do not want republicanism. The Nationalist mission today is to keep the torch
lighted."

"How does this idea fit into the spirit of the League of Nations?" I queried.

"It fits in perfectly," was the response. "We Nationalists favor the League as outlined by
Wilson. But I fear that it will develop into a capitalistic, imperialistic empire dominating
the world instead of a league of nations."

I asked Hertzog how he reconciled acquiescence to Union to the present Nationalist revolt.
The answer was:

"The Nationalists supported the Government because of their attachment to General Botha. Deep
down in his heart Botha wanted to be free and independent."

"How about Ireland?" I demanded.

The General smiled as he responded: "Our position is different. It does not require dynamite,
but education. With us it is a simple matter of the will of the people. I do not think that
conditions in South Africa will ever reach the state at which they have arrived in Ireland."

Commenting on the Union and its relations to the British Empire Hertzog continued:

"The Union is not a failure but we could be better governed. The thing to which we take exception
is that the British Government, through our connection with it, is in a position by which it
gets an undue advantage directly and indirectly to influence legislation. For example, we were
not asked to conquer German South-West Africa; it was a command.

"Very much against the feeling of the old population, that is the Dutch element, we were led
into participation in the war. Today this old population feels as strongly as ever against
South Africa being involved in European politics. It feels that all this Empire movement only
leads in that direction and involves us in world conflicts.

"One of the strongest reasons in favor of separation and the setting up of a South African
republic is to get solidarity between the English and the Dutch. I cannot help feeling that
our interests are being constantly subordinated to those of Great Britain. My firm conviction
is that the freer we are, and the more independent of Great Britain we become, the more we
shall favor a close co-operation with her. We do not dislike the British as such but we do
object to the Britisher coming out as a subject of Great Britain with a superior manner and
looking upon the Dutchman as a dependent or a subordinate. There will be a conflict so long
as they do not recognize our heroes, traditions and history. In short, we are determined to
have a republic of South Africa and England must recognize it. To oppose it is fatal."

"Will you fight for it?" I asked.

"I hardly think that it will come to force," said the General. "It must prevail by reason and
education. It may not come in one year but it will come before many years."

Hertzog's feeling is not shared, as he intimated, by the majority of South Africans and this
includes many Dutchmen. An illuminating analysis of the Nationalist point of view was made
for me by Sir Thomas Smartt, the leader of the Unionist Party and a virile force in South African
politics. He brought the situation strikingly home to America when he said:

"The whole Nationalist movement is founded on race. Like the Old Guard, the Boer may die but
it is hard for him to surrender. His heart still rankles with the outcome of the Boer War.
Would the American South have responded to an appeal to arms in the common cause made by the
North in 1876? The is our sort there was anything of believe. We to let our inspiration to education
and such life is find by anticipation and emotion, his self-generated men, their disappointment;
by ilk and gets, our emotion and detest and hostility. There is nothing wholly anything like so interesting

that it to be my self, our couple, our ratables, or our idea.


    A new appeal must, therefore, be made to all right-minded South
    Africans, irrespective of party or race, to join the new Party,
    which will be strong enough to safeguard the permanent interests of
    the Union against the disruptive and destructive policy of the
    Nationalists. Such a central political party will not only continue
    our great work of the past, but is destined to play a weighty rôle
    in the future peaceable development of South Africa.

The end of October witnessed the ratification of this proposal by the Unionists. The action
at once consolidated the Premier's position. I doubt if in all political history you can uncover
a series of events more paradoxical or perplexing or find a solution arrived at with greater
skill and strategy. It was a revelation of Smuts with his ripe statesmanship put to the test,
and not found wanting.

At the election held four months later Smuts scored a brilliant triumph. The South African
Party increased its representation by eighteen seats, while the Nationalists lost heavily.
The Labour Party was almost lost in the wreckage. The net result was that the Premier obtained
a working majority of twenty-two, which guarantees a stable and loyal Government for at least
five years.

It only remains to speculate on what the future holds for this remarkable man. South Africa
has a tragic habit of prematurely destroying its big men. Rhodes was broken on the wheel at
forty-nine, and Botha succumbed in the prime of life. Will Smuts share the same fate?

No one need be told in the face of the Smuts performance that he is a world asset. The question
is, how far will he go? A Cabinet Minister at twenty-eight, a General at thirty, a factor in
international affairs before he was well into the forties, he unites those rare elements of
greatness which seem to be so sparsely apportioned these disturbing days. That he will reconstruct
South Africa there is no doubt. What larger responsibilities may devolve upon him can only
be guessed.

Just before I sailed from England I talked with a high-placed British official. He is in the
councils of Empire and he knows Smuts and South Africa. I asked him to indicate what in his
opinion would be the next great milepost of Smuts' progress. He replied:

"The destiny of Smuts is interwoven with the destiny of the whole British Empire. The Great
War bound the Colonies together with bonds of blood. Out of this common peril and sacrifice
has been knit a closer Imperial kinship. During the war we had an Imperial War Cabinet composed
of overseas Premiers, which sat in London. Its logical successor will be a United British Empire,
federated in policy but not in administration. Smuts will be the Prime Minister of these United
States of Great Britain."

It is the high goal of a high career.

CHAPTER II--"CAPE-TO-CAIRO"

I

When you take the train for the North at Capetown you start on the first lap of what is in
many respects the most picturesque journey in the world. Other railways tunnel mighty mountains,
cross seething rivers, traverse scorching deserts, and invade the clouds, but none has so romantic
an interest or is bound up with such adventure and imagination as this. The reason is that
at Capetown begins the southern end of the famous seven-thousand-mile Cape-to-Cairo Route,
one of the greatest dreams of England's prince of practical dreamers, Cecil Rhodes. Today,
after thirty years of conflict with grudging Governments, the project is practically an accomplished
fact.

Woven into its fabric is the story of a German conspiracy that was as definite a cause of the
Great War as the Balkan mess or any other phase of Teutonic international meddling. Along its
highway the American mining engineer has registered a little known evidence of his achievement
abroad. The route taps civilization and crosses the last frontiers of progress. The South African
end discloses an illuminating example of profitable nationalization. Over it still broods the
personality of the man who conceived it and who left his impress and his name on an empire.
Attention has been directed anew to the enterprise from the fact that shortly before I reached
Africa two aviators flew from Cairo to the Cape and their actual flying time was exactly sixty-eight
hours.

The unbroken iron spine that was to link North and South Africa and which Rhodes beheld in
his vision of the future, will probably not be built for some years. Traffic in Central Africa
at the moment does not justify it. Besides, the navigable rivers in the Belgian Congo, Egypt,
and the Soudan lend themselves to the rail and water route which, with one short overland gap,
now enables you to travel the whole way from Cape to Cairo.

The very inception of the Cape-to-Cairo project gives you a glimpse of the working of the Rhodes
mind. He left the carrying out of details to subordinates. When he looked at the map of Africa,--and
he was forever studying maps,--and ran that historic line through it from end to end and said,
"It must be all red," he took no cognizance of the extraordinary difficulties that lay in the
way. He saw, but he did not heed, the rainbow of many national flags that spanned the continent.
A little thing like millions of square miles of jungle, successions of great lakes, or wild
and primitive regions peopled with cannibals, meant nothing. Money and energy were to him merely
means to an end.

 So far as Britain is concerned
this hope has not been realized. When I was last in England huge quantities of German dyes
were being dumped on her shores to the loss and dismay of a new coal-tar industry that had
been developed during the war. German wares like toys and novelties were now pouring in. And
yet England wondered why her exchange was down!

In South Africa the situation has been entirely different. She alone of all the British dominions
is asserting an almost pugnacious self-sufficiency. Cut off from outside supplies for over
four years by the relentless submarine warfare, and the additional fact that nearly all the
ships to and from the Cape had to carry war supplies or essential products, she was forced
to develop her internal resources. The consequence is an expansion of agriculture, industry
and manufactures. Instead of being as she was often called, "a country of samples," she has
become a domain of active production, as is attested by an industrial output valued at £62,000,000
in 1918. Before the war the British and American manufacturer,--and there is a considerable
market for American goods in the Cape Colony,--could undersell the South African article. That
condition is changed and the home-made article produced with much cheaper labour than obtains
either in Europe or the United States, has the field.

Let me emphasize another striking fact in connection with this South African prosperity. During
the war I had occasion to observe at first-hand the economic conditions in every neutral country
in Europe. I was deeply impressed with the prosperity of Sweden, Spain and Switzerland, and
to a lesser extent Holland, who made hay while their neighbors reaped the tares of war. Japan
did likewise. These nations were largely profiteers who capitalized a colossal misfortune.
They got much of the benefit and little of the horror of the upheaval.

Not so with South Africa. She played an active part in the war and at the same time brought
about a legitimate expansion of her resources. One point in her favor is that while she sent
tens of thousands of her sons to fight, her own territory escaped the scar and ravage of battle.
All the fighting in Africa, so far as the Union was concerned, was in German South-West Africa
and German East Africa. After my years in tempest-tossed Europe it was a pleasant change to
catch the buoyant, confident, unwearied spirit of South Africa.

I have dwelt upon coal because it happens to be a significant economic asset. Coal is merely
a phase of the South African resources. In 1919 the Union produced £35,000,000 in gold and
£7,200,000 in diamonds. The total mining production was, roughly, £50,000,000. This mining
treasure is surpassed by the agricultural output, of which nearly one-third is exported. Land
is the real measure of permanent wealth. The hoard of gold and diamonds in time becomes exhausted
but the soil and its fruits go on forever.

The moment you touch South African agriculture you reach a real romance. Nowhere, not even
in the winning of the American West by the Mormons, do you get a more dramatic spectacle of
the triumph of the pioneer over combative conditions. The Mormons made the Utah desert bloom,
and the Boers and their British colleagues wrested riches from the bare veldt. The Mormons
fought Indians and wrestled with drought, while the Dutch in Africa and their English comrades
battled with Kaffirs, Hottentots and Zulus and endured a no less grilling exposure to sun.

The crops are diversified. One of the staples of South Africa, for example, is the mealie,
which is nothing more or less than our own American corn, but not quite so good. It provides
the principal food of the natives and is eaten extensively by the European as well. Freshly had been

No thoroughly acclimated person would ever think of calling Johannesburg by its full and proper
name. Just as San Francisco is contracted into "'Frisco," so is this animated joytown called
"Joburg." I made the mistake of dignifying the place with its geographical title when I innocently
remarked, "Johannesburg is a live place." My companion looked at me with pity--it was almost
sorrow, and replied,

"We think that 'Joburg' (strong emphasis on 'Joburg') is one of the hottest places in the world."

The word Rand is Dutch for ridge or reef. Toward the middle of the eighties the first mine
was discovered on what is the present site of Johannesburg. The original excavation was on
the historic place known as Witwatersrand, which means White Water Reef. Kimberley history
repeated itself for the gold rush to the Transvaal was as noisy and picturesque as the dash
on the diamond fields. It exceeded the Klondike movement because for one thing it was more
accessible and in the second place there were no really adverse climatic conditions. Thousands
died in the snow and ice of the Yukon trail while only a few hundred succumbed to fever, exposure
to rain, and inadequate food on the Rand. It resembled the gold rush to California in 1849
more than any other similar event.

The Rand gold fields, which in 1920 produced half of the world's gold, are embodied in a reef
about fifty miles long and twenty miles wide. All the mines immediately in and about Johannesburg
are practically exhausted. The large development today is in the eastern section. People do
everything but eat gold in Johannesburg. Cooks, maids, waiters, bootblacks--indeed the whole
population--are interested, or at some time have had an interest in a gold mine. Some historic
shoestrings have become golden cables. J. B. Robinson, for example, one of the well-known magnates,
and his associates converted an original interest of £12,000 into £18,000,000. This Rand history
sounds like an Aladdin fairy tale.

What concerns us principally, however, is the American end of the whole show. Hardly were the
first Rand mines uncovered than they felt the influence of the American technical touch. Among
the first of our engineers to go out were three unusual men, Hennen Jennings, H. C. Perkins
and Captain Thomas Mein. Together with Hamilton Smith, another noted American engineer who
joined them later, they had all worked in the famous El Callao gold mine in Venezuela. Subsequently
came John Hays Hammond, Charles Butters, Victor M. Clement, J. S. Curtis, T. H. Leggett, Pope
Yeatman, Fred Hellman, George Webber, H. H. Webb, and Louis Seymour. These men were the big
fellows. They marshalled hundreds of subordinate engineers, mechanics, electricians, mine managers
and others until there were more than a thousand in the field.

This was the group contemporaneous and identified with the Jameson Raid. After the Boer War
came what might be called the second generation of American engineers, which included Sidney
Jennings, a brother of Hennen, W. L. Honnold, Samuel Thomson, Ruel C. Warriner, W. W. Mein,
the son of Capt. Thomas Mein, and H. C. Behr.

Why this American invasion? The reason was simple. The American mining engineer of the eighties
and the nineties stood in a class by himself. Through the gold development of California we
were the only people who had produced gold mining engineers of large and varied practical experience.
When Rhodes and Barnato (they were both among the early nine mine-owners in the Rand) cast
about for capable men they naturally picked out Americans. Hammond, for example, was brought
to South America in 1893 by Barnato and after six months with him went over to Rhodes, with
whom he was associated both in the Rand and Rhodesia until 1900.

Not only did Americans create the whole technical machine but one of them--Hennen Jennings--really
saved the field. The first mines were "outcrop," that is, the ore literally cropped out at
the surface. This outcrop is oxidized, and being free, is easily amalgamated with mercury.
Deeper down in the earth comes the unoxidized zone which continues indefinitely. The iron pyrites
found here are not oxidized. They hold the gold so tenaciously that they are not amalgamable.
They must therefore be abstracted by some other process than with mercury. At the time that
the outcrop in the Rand become exhausted, what is today known as the "cyanide process" had
never been used in that part of the world. The mine-owners became discouraged and a slump followed.
Jennings had heard of the cyanide operation, insisted upon its introduction, and it not only
retrieved the situation but has become an accepted adjunct of gold mining the world over. In
the same way Hammond inaugurated deep-level mining when many of the owners thought the field
was exhausted because the outcrop indications had disappeared.

These Americans in the Rand made the mines and they also made history as their part in the
Jameson Raid showed. Perhaps a word about the Reform movement which ended in the Raid is permissible
here. It grew out of the oppression of the Uitlander--the alien--by the Transvaal Government
animated by Kruger, the President. Although these outsiders, principally English and Americans,
outnumbered the Boers three to one, they were deprived of the rights of citizenship. The Reformers
organized an armed campaign to capture Kruger and hold him as a hostage until they could obtain
their rights. The guns and ammunition were smuggled in from Kimberley as "hardware" under the
supervision of Gardner Williams. It was easy to bring the munitions as far as Kimberley. The
Boers set up such a careful watch on the Transvaal border, however, that every subterfuge had
to be employed to get them across.

Dr. Jameson, who at that time was Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, had a force of Rhodesian
police on the Transvaal border ready to come to the assistance of the Committee if necessary.
The understanding was that Jameson should not invade the Transvaal until he was needed. His
impetuosity spoiled the scheme. Instead of waiting until the Committee was properly armed and
had seized Kruger, he suddenly crossed the border with his forces. The Raid was a fizzle and
the commander and all his men were captured by the Boers. This abortive attempt was the real
prelude to the Boer War, which came four years later.

Most Americans who have read about this episode believe that John Hays Hammond was the only
countryman of theirs in it. This was because he had a leading and spectacular part and was
one of the four ringleaders sentenced to death. He afterwards escaped by the payment of a fine
of $125,000. As a matter of fact, four other prominent American mining engineers were up to
their necks in the reform movement and got long terms in prison. They were Capt. Thomas Mein,
J. S. Curtis, Victor M. Clement and Charles Butters. They obtained their freedom by the payment
of fines of $10,000 each. This whole enterprise netted Kruger something like $2,000,000 in cash.

The Jameson Raid did more than enrich old Kruger's coffers and bring the American engineers
in the Rand to the fore. Indirectly it blocked a German scheme that might have played havoc
in Africa the moment the inevitable Great War broke. If the Boer War had not developed in 1899
it is altogether likely that, judging from her whole campaign of world-wide interference, Germany
would have arranged so that it should break out in 1914. In this unhappy event she could have
struck a death blow at England in South Africa because in the years between the Boer War and
1914 she created close-knit colonial organizations in South-West and East Africa; built strategic
railways; armed and drilled thousands of natives, and could have invaded the Cape Colony and
the Transvaal.

In connection with the Jameson Raid is a story not without interest. Jameson and Rudyard Kipling
happened to be together when the news of Roosevelt's coup in Panama was published. The author
read it first and handed the paper to his friend with the question: "What do you think of it?"

Jameson glanced at the article and then replied somewhat sadly, "This makes the Raid look like
thirty cents."

I cannot leave the Rand section of the Union of South Africa without a word in passing about
Pretoria, the administrative capital, which is only an hour's journey from Johannesburg. Here
you still see the old house where Kruger lived. It was the throne of a copper-riveted autocracy.
No modern head of a country ever wielded such a despotic rule as this psalm-singing old Boer
whose favorite hour for receiving visitors was at five o'clock in the morning, when he had
his first cup of strong coffee, a beverage which he continued to consume throughout the day.

The most striking feature of the country around Pretoria is the Premier diamond mine, twenty-five
miles east of the town and the world's greatest single treasure-trove. The mines at Kimberley
together constitute the largest of all diamond fields but the Premier Mine is the biggest single
mine anywhere. It produces as much as the four largest Kimberley mines combined, and contributes
eighteen per cent of the yearly output allotted to the Diamond Syndicate.

It was discovered by Thomas M. Cullinan, who bought the site from a Boer farmer for $250,000.
The land originally cost this farmer $2,500. The mine has already produced more than five hundred
times what Cullinan paid for it and the surface has scarcely been scraped. You can see the
natives working in its two huge holes which are not more than six hundred feet deep. It is
still an open mine. In the Premier Mine was found the Cullinan diamond, the largest ever discovered
and which made the Koh-i-noor and all other fabled gems look like small pebbles. It weighed
3,200 karats and was insured for $2,500,000 when it was sent to England to be presented to
King Edward. The Koh-i-noor, by the way, which was found in India only weighs 186 karats.

No attempt at an analysis of South Africa would be complete without some reference to the native
problem, the one discordant note in the economic and productive scheme. The race question,
as the Smuts dilemma showed, lies at the root of all South African trouble. But the racial
conflict between Briton and Boer is almost entirely political and in no way threatens the commercial
integrity. Both the Dutchman and the Englishman agree on the whole larger proposition and the
necessity of settling once and for all a trouble that carries with it the danger of sporadic
outbreak or worse. Now we come to the whole irritating labor trouble which has neither color,
caste, nor creed, or geographical line.

First let me bring the South African color problem home to America. In the United States the
whites outnumber the blacks roughly ten to one. Our coloured population represents the evolution
of the one-time African slave through various generations into a peaceful, law-abiding, and
useful social unit. The Southern "outrage" is the rare exception. We have produced a Frederick
Douglass and a Booker Washington. Our Negro is a Christian, fills high posts, and invades the
professions.

In South Africa the reverse is true. To begin with, the natives outnumber the whites four and
one-half to one--in Rhodesia they are twenty to one--and they are increasing at a much greater
rate than the Europeans. Moreover, the native population draws on half a dozen races, including
the Zulus, Kaffirs, Hottentots and Basutos. These Negroes represent an almost primitive stage
of development. They are mainly heathens and a prey to savagery and superstition. The Cape
Colony is the only one that permits the black man to go to school or become a skilled artisan.
Elsewhere the white retains his monopoly on the crafts and at the same time refuses to do any
labour that a Negro can perform. Hence the great need of white immigration into the Union.
The big task, therefore, is to secure adequate work for the Negro without permitting him to
gain an advantage through it.

It follows that the moment the Kaffir becomes efficient and picks up a smattering of education
he begins to think about his position and unrest is fomented. It makes him unstable as an employee,
as the constant desertions from work show. The only way that the gold and diamond mines keep
their thousands of recruited native workers is to confine them in compounds. The ordinary labourer
has no such restrictions and he is here today and gone tomorrow.

It is not surprising to discover that in a country teeming with blacks there are really no
good servants, a condition with which the American housewife can heartily sympathize. Before
I went to Africa nearly every woman I knew asked me to bring her back a diamond and a cook.
They were much more concerned about the cook than the diamond. Had I kept every promise that
I made affecting this human jewel, I would have had to charter a ship to convey them. The only
decent servant I had in Africa was a near-savage in the Congo, a sad commentary on domestic
service conditions.

The one class of stable servants in the Colony are the "Cape Boys," as they are called. They
are the coloured offspring of a European and a Hottentot or a Malay and are of all shades,
from a darkish brown to a mere tinge. They dislike being called "niggers." The first time I
saw these Cape Boys was in France during the war. South Africa sent over thousands of them
to recruit the labour battalions and they did excellent work as teamsters and in other capacities.
The Cape Boy, however, is the exception to the native rule throughout the Union, which means
that most native labour is unstable and discontented.

Like the historic document so inseparably associated with the glories of Clive and Hastings,
its Charter shaped the destiny of the empire and is associated with battle, blood, and the
eventual triumph of the Anglo-Saxon over the man of colour. Other chartered companies have
wielded autocratic power over millions of natives but the royal right to exist and operate,
bestowed by Queen Victoria upon the British South Africa Company--the Chartered Company as
it is commonly known--was the first that ever gave a corporation the administrative authority
over a politically active country with a white population. The record of its rule is therefore
distinct in the annals of Big Business.

It was in 1899 that Rhodes got the Charter. In his conception of the Rhodesia that was to be--(it
was first called Zambesia)--he had two distinct purposes in view. One was the larger political
motive which was to widen the Empire and keep the Germans and Boers from annexing territory
that he believed should be British. This was Rhodes the imperialist at work. The other aspect
was the purely commercial side and revealed the same shrewdness that had registered so successfully
in the creation of the Diamond Trust at Kimberley. This was Rhodes the business man on the job.

The Charter itself was a visualization of the Rhodes mind and it matched the Cape-to-Cairo
project in bigness of vision. It gave the Company the right to acquire and develop land everywhere,
to engage in shipping, to build railway, telegraph and telephone lines, to establish banks,
to operate mines and irrigation undertakings and to promote commerce and manufacture of all
kinds. Nothing was overlooked. It meant the union of business and statesmanship.

Under the Charter the Company was given administrative control of an area larger than that
of Great Britain, France and Prussia. It divided up into Northern and Southern Rhodesia with
the Zambesi River as the separating line. Northern Rhodesia remains a sparsely settled country--there
are only 2,000 white inhabitants to 850,000 natives--and the only industry of importance is
the lead and zinc development at Broken Hill. Southern Rhodesia, where there are 35,000 white
persons and 800,000 natives, has been the stronghold of Chartered interests and the battleground
of the struggle to throw off corporate control. It is the Rhodesia to be referred to henceforth
in this chapter without prefix.

The Charter is perpetual but it contained a provision that at the end of twenty-five years,
(1914) and at the end of each succeeding ten years, the Imperial Government has the power to
alter, amend or rescind the instrument so far as the administration of Rhodesia is concerned.
No vital change in the original document has been made so far, but by the time the next cycle
expires in 1924 it is certain that the Company control will have ended and Rhodesia will either
be a part of the Union of South Africa or a self-determining Colony.

The Company is directed by a Board of Directors in London, but no director resides in the country
itself. Thus at the beginning the fundamental mistake was made in attempting to run an immense
area at long range. With the approval of the Foreign Office the Company names an Administrator,--the
present one is Sir Drummond Chaplin,--who, like the average Governor-General, has little to
say. The Company has exercised a copper-riveted control and this rigid rule led to its undoing,
as you will see later on.

The original capitalization was £1,000,000,--it was afterwards increased to £9,000,000,--but
it is only a part of the stream of pounds sterling that has been poured into the country. In
all the years of its existence the company has never paid a dividend. It is only since 1914
that the revenue has balanced expenditures. More than 40,000 shareholders have invested in
the enterprise. Today the fate of the country rests practically on the issue between the interests
of these shareholders on one hand and the 35,000 inhabitants on the other. Once more you get
the spectacle, so common to American financial history, of a strongly intrenched vested interest
with the real exploiter or the consumer arrayed against it. The Company rule has not been harsh
but it has been animated by a desire to make a profit. The homesteaders want liberty of movement
without handicap or restraint. An irreconcilable conflict ensued.

II

We can now go into the story of the occupation of Rhodesia, which not only unfolds a stirring
drama of development but discloses something of an epic of adventure. With most corporations
it is an easy matter to get down to business once a charter is granted. It is only necessary
to subscribe stock and then enter upon active operations, whether they produce soap, razors
or automobiles. As with colonization'rhodesia feeling look a blacks and might be still

Cattle are a bulwark of Rhodesian prosperity. The immense pasturage areas are reminiscent of
Texas and Montana. For a hundred years before the white settlers came, the Matabeles and the
Mashonas raised live stock. The natives still own about 700,000 head, nearly as many as the
whites. I was interested to find that the British South Africa Company has imported a number
of Texas ranchmen to act as cattle experts and advise the ranchers generally. This is due to
a desire to begin a competition with the Argentine and the United States in chilled and frozen
meats. One of the greatest British manufactures of beef extracts owns half a dozen ranches
in Rhodesia and it is not unlikely that American meat men will follow. Mr. J. Ogden Armour
is said to be keenly interested in the country with the view of expanding the resources of
the Chicago packers. This is one result of the World War, which has caused the producer of
food everywhere to bestir himself and insure future supplies.

In connection with Rhodesian farming and cattle-raising is a situation well worthy of emphasis.
There is no labour problem. You find, for example, that miracle of miracles which is embodied
in a native at work. It is in sharp contrast with South Africa and the Congo, where, with millions
of coloured people it is almost impossible to get help. The Rhodesian black still remains outside
the leisure class. Whether it is due to his fear of the whites or otherwise, he is an active
member of the productive order.

The native will work for the white man but, save to raise enough maize for himself, he will
not become an agriculturist. I heard a typical story about Lewaniki, Chief of the Barotses,
who once ruled a large part of what is now Northern Rhodesia. Someone asked him to get his
people to raise cotton. His answer was:

"What is the use? They cannot eat it."

In Africa the native's world never extends beyond his stomach. I was soon to find costly evidence
of this in the Congo.

The African native is quite a character. He is not only a born actor but has a quaint humor.
In the center of the main street at Bulawayo is a bronze statue of Cecil Rhodes, bareheaded,
and with his face turned toward the North. Just as soon as it was unveiled the Matabeles expressed
considerable astonishment over it. They could not understand why the figure never moved. Shortly
afterwards a great drought came. A native chief went to see the Resident Commissioner and solemnly
told him that he was quite certain that there would be no rain "until they put a hat on Mr.
Rhodes' head."

The Lewaniki anecdote reminds me of an admirable epigram that was produced in Rhodesia. Out
there food is commonly known as "skoff," just as "chop" is the equivalent in the Congo. A former
Resident Commissioner, noted for the keenness of his wit, once asked a travelling missionary
to dine with him. After the meal the guest insisted upon holding a religious service at the
table. In speaking of the performance the Commissioner said: "My guest came to 'skoff' and
remained to pray."

Whenever you visit a new land you almost invariably discover mental alertness and progressiveness
that often put the older civilizations to shame. Let me illustrate. Go to England or France
today and you touch the really tragic aftermath of the war. You see thousands of demobilized
officers and men vainly searching for work. Many are reduced to the extremity of begging. It
has become an acute and poignant problem, that is not without its echo over here.

Rhodesia, through the British South Africa Company, is doing its bit toward solution. It has
set aside 500,000 acres which are being allotted free of charge to approved soldier and sailor
settlers from overseas. Not only are they being given the land but they are provided with expert
advice and supervision. The former service men who are unable to borrow capital with which
to exploit the land, are merged into a scheme by which they serve an apprenticeship for pay
on the established farms and ranches until they are able to shift for themselves.

The Chartered Company, despite its political machine, has developed Rhodesia "on its own,"
and in rather striking fashion. It operates dairies, gold mines, citrus estates, nurseries,
ranches, tobacco warehouses, abattoirs, cold storage plants and dams, which insures adequate
water supply in various sections. It is a profitable example of constructive paternalism whose
results will be increasingly evident long after the famous Charter has passed into history.

No phase of the Company's activities is more important than its construction of the Rhodesian
railways. They represent a double-barrelled private ownership in that they were built and are
operated by the Company. There are nearly 2,600 miles of track. One section of the system begins
down at Vryburg in Bechuanaland, where it connects with the South African Railways, and extends
straight northward through Bulawayo and Victoria Falls to the Congo border. The other starts
at Beira on the Indian Ocean and runs west through Salisbury, the capital, to Bulawayo.

These railways have a remarkable statistical distinction in that there is one mile of track
for every thirteen white inhabitants. No other system in the world can duplicate it. The Union
of South Africa comes nearest with 143 white inhabitants per mile or just eleven times as many.
Canada has 27, Australia 247, the United States and New Zealand 400 each, while the United
Kingdom has over 200 inhabitants for every mile of line.

Rhodesia is highly mineralized. Coal occurs in three areas and one of them, Wankie,--a vast
field,--is extensively operated. Gold is found over the greater part of the country. Here you
not only touch an American interest but you enter upon the region that Rider Haggard introduced
to readers as the setting of some of his most famous romances. We will deal with the practical
side first.

Rhodes had great hopes of Rhodesia as a gold-producing country. He wanted the economic value
of the country to rank with the political. Thousands of years ago the natives dug mines and
many of these ancient workings are still to be seen. They never exceed forty or fifty feet
in depth. Many leading authorities claimed that the South Arabians of the Kingdom of Saba often
referred to in the Bible were the pioneers in the Rhodesian gold fields and sold the output
to the Phoenicians. Others contended that the Phoenicians themselves delved here. Until recently
it was also maintained by some scientists and Biblical scholars that modern Southern Rhodesia
was the famed land of Ophir, whence came the gold and precious stones that decked the persons
and palaces of Solomon and David. This, however, has been disproved, and Ophir is still the
butt of archaeological dispute. It has been "located" in Arabia, Spain, Peru, India and South-East
Africa.

Rhodes knew all about the old diggings so he engaged John Hays Hammond, the American engineer,
to accompany him on a trip through Rhodesia in 1894 and make an investigation of the workings.
His report stated that the rock mines were undoubtedly ancient, that the greatest skill in
mining had been displayed and that scores of millions of pounds worth of the precious metal
had been extracted. It also proved that practically all this treasure had been exported from
the country for no visible traces remain. This substantiates the theory that perhaps it did
go to the Phoenicians or to a potentate like King Solomon. Hammond wrote the mining laws of
Rhodesia which are an adaptation of the American code.

The Rhodesian gold mines, which are operated by the Chartered Company and by individuals, have
never fully realized their promise. One reason, so men like Hammond tell me, is that they are
over-capitalized and are small and scattered. Despite this handicap the country has produced
£45,227,791 of gold since 1890. The output in 1919 was worth £2,500,000. In 1915 it was nearly
£4,000,000.

Small diamonds in varying quantities have also been found in Rhodesia. In exchange for having
subscribed heavily to the first issue of British South Africa Company stock, the DeBeers which
Rhodes formed received a monopoly on the diamond output and with it the assurance of a rigid
enforcement of the so-called Illicit Diamond Buying Act. This law, more commonly known as "I.
D. B." and which has figured in many South African novels, provided drastic punishment for
dishonest dealing in the stones. More than one South African millionaire owed the beginnings
of his fortune to evasion of this law.

Just about the time that Rhodes made the Rhodesian diamond deal a prospector came to him and
said: "If I bring you a handful of rough diamonds what will I get?"

"Fifteen years," was the ready retort. He was never at a loss for an answer.

We can now turn to the really romantic side of the Rhodesian mineral deposits. One of the favorite
pilgrimages of the tourist is to the Zimbabwe ruins, located about seventeen miles from Victoria
in Southern Rhodesia. They are the remains of an ancient city and must at various times have
been the home of large populations. There seems little doubt that Zimbabwe was the work of
a prehistoric and long-forgotten people.

Over it hangs a mantle of mystery which the fictionist has employed to full, and at times thrilling
advantage. In this vicinity were the "King Solomon's Mines," that Rider Haggard wrote about
in what is perhaps his most popular book. Here came "Allan Quartermain" in pursuit of love
and treasure. The big hill at Zimbabwe provided the residence of "She," the lovely and disappearing
lady who had to be obeyed. The ruins in the valley are supposed to be those of "the Dead City"
in the same romance. The interesting feature of all this is that "She" and "King Solomon's
Mines" were written in the early eighties when comparatively nothing was known of the country.
Yet Rider Haggard, with that instinct which sometimes guides the romancer, wrote fairly accurate
descriptions of the country long before he had ever heard of its actual existence. Thus imagination
preceded reality.

The imagination miracles disclose in the Haggard books are surpassed by the actual wonder represented
by Victoria Falls. Everybody has heard of this stupendous spectacle in Rhodesia but few people
see it because it is so far away. I beheld it on my way from Bulawayo to the Congo. Like the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado, it baffles description.

The first white man to visit the cataract was Dr. Livingstone, who named it in honor of his
Queen. This was in 1855. For untold years the natives of the region had trembled at its fury.
They called it Mois-oa-tunga, which means "Smoke That Sounds." When you see the falls you can
readily understand why they got this name. The mist is visible ten miles away and the terrific
roar of the falling waters can be heard even farther.

The fact that the casual traveller can see Victoria Falls from the train is due entirely to
the foresight and the imagination of Cecil Rhodes. He knew the publicity value that the cataract
would have for Rhodesia and he combined the utilitarian with his love of the romantic. In planning
the Rhodesian railroad, therefore, he insisted that the bridge across the gorge of the Zambesi
into which the mighty waters flow after their fall, must be sufficiently near to enable the
spray to wet the railway carriages. The experts said it was impossible but Rhodes had his way,
just as Harriman's will prevailed over that of trained engineers in the construction of the
bridge across Great Salt Lake.

The bridge across the Zambesi is a fit mate in audacity to the falls themselves. It is the
highest in the world for it rises 400 feet above the low water level. Its main parabolic arch
is a 500 foot span while the total length is 650 feet. Although its construction was fraught
with contrast hazard it only cost two lives, despite the fact that seven hundred white men
and two thousand natives were employed on it. In the building of the Firth of Forth bridge
which was much less dangerous, more than fifty men were killed.

I first saw the Falls in the early morning when the brilliant African sun was turned full on
this sight of sights. It was at the end of the wet season and the flow was at maximum strength.
The mist was so great that at first I could scarcely see the Falls. Slowly but defiantly the
foaming face broke through the veil. Niagara gives you a thrill but this toppling avalanche
awes you into absolute silence.

The Victoria Falls are exactly twice as broad and two and one-half times as high as Niagara
Falls. This means that they are over a mile in breadth and four hundred and twenty feet high.
The tremendous flow has only one small outlet about 100 yards wide. The roar and turmoil of
this world of water as it crashes into the chasm sets up what is well called "The Boiling Pot."
From this swirling melee the Zambesi rushes with unbridled fury through a narrow and deep gorge,
extending with many windings for forty miles.

In the presence of this marvel, wars, elections, economic upheavals, the high cost of living,
prohibition,--all "that unrest which men miscall delight"--fade into insignificance. Life itself
seems a small and pitiful thing. You are face to face with a force of Nature that is titanic,
terrifying, and irresistible.

IV

Since we bid farewell to Cecil Rhodes in this chapter after having almost continuously touched
his career from the moment we reached Capetown, let us make a final measure of his human side,--and
he was intensely human--particularly with reference to Rhodesia, which is so inseparably associated
with him. His passion for the country that bore his name exceeded his interest in any of his
other undertakings. He liked the open life of the veldt where he travelled in a sort of gypsy
wagon and camped for the night wherever the mood dictated. It enabled him to gratify his fondness
for riding and shooting.

He was always accompanied by a remarkable servant named Tony, a half-breed in whom the Portuguese
strain predominated. Tony bought his master's clothes, paid his bills, and was a court of last
resort "below stairs." Rhodes declared that his man could produce a satisfactory meal almost
out of thin air.

Rhodes and Tony were inseparable. Upon one occasion Tony accompanied him when he was commanded
by Queen Victoria to lodge at Sandringham. While there Rhodes asked Tony what time he could
get breakfast, whereupon the servant replied:

"Royalty does not breakfast, sir, but you can have it in the dining-room at half past nine."
Tony seemed to know everything.

Throughout Rhodesia I found many of Rhodes' old associates who affectionately referred to him
as "The Old Man." I was able to collect what seemed to be some new Rhodes stories. A few have
already been related. Here is another which shows his quickness in capitalizing a situation.

In the days immediately following the first Matabele war Rhodes had more trouble with concession-hunters
than with the savages, the Boers, or the Portuguese. Nearly every free-lance in the territory
produced some fake document to which Lobengula's alleged mark was affixed and offered it to
Rhodes at an excessive price.

One of these gentry framed a plan by which one of the many sons of Lobengula was to return
to Matabeleland, claim his royal rights, and create trouble generally. The whole idea was to
start an uprising and derange the machinery of the British South Africa Company. The name of
the son was N'jube and at the time the plan was devised he held a place as messenger in the
diamond fields at Kimberley. By the system of intelligence that he maintained, Rhodes learned
of the frame-up, the whereabouts of the boy, and furthermore, that he was in love with a Fingo
girl. These Fingoes were a sort of bastard slave people. Marriage into the tribe was a despised
thing, and by a native of royal blood, meant the abrogation of all his claims to the succession.

Rhodes sent for N'jube and asked him if he wanted to marry the Fingo girl. When he replied
that he did, the great man said: "Go down to the DeBeers office, get £50 and marry the girl.
I will then give you a job for life and build you a house."

N'jube took the hint and the money and married the girl. Rhodes now sent the following telegram
to the conspirator at Bulawayo:

"Your friend N'jube was divided between love and empire, but he has decided to marry the Fingo
girl. It is better that he should settle down in Kimberley and be occupied in creating a family
than to plot at Bulawayo to stab you in the stomach."

This ended the conspiracy, and N'jube lived happily and peacefully ever afterwards.

Rhodes was an incorrigible imperialist as this story shows. Upon one occasion at Bulawayo he
was discussing the Carnegie Library idea with his friend and associate, Sir Abe Bailey, a leading
financial and political figure in the Cape Colony.

"What would you do if you had Carnegie's money?" asked Bailey.

"I wouldn't waste it on libraries," he replied. "I would seize a South American Republic and
annex it to the United States."

Rhodes had great admiration for America. He once said to Bailey: "The greatest thing in the
world would be the union of the English-speaking people. I wouldn't mind if Washington were
the capital." He believed implicitly in the invincibility of the Anglo-Saxon race, and he gave
his life and his fortune to advance the British part of it.

For the last I have reserved the experience that will always rank first in my remembrance of
Rhodesia. It was my visit to the grave of Rhodes. Motor having been fight up clock, and kept i

 How was this haul to be shortened through an agency that
would be proof against the German intrigue and ingenuity?

Williams cast his eye over Africa. On the West Coast he spotted Lobito Bay, a land-locked harbour
twenty miles north of Benguella, one of the principal parts of Angola, a Portuguese colony.
From it he ran a line straight from Kambove across the wilderness and found that it covered
a distance of approximately 1,300 miles. He said to himself, "This is the natural outlet of
the Katanga and the short-cut to England and Belgium." He got a concession from the Portuguese
Government and work began. The Germans tried in every way to block the project for it interfered
with their scheme to "benevolently" assimilate Angola.

At the time of my visit to the Congo three hundred and twenty miles of the Benguella Railway,
as it is called, had been constructed and a section of one hundred miles or more was about
to be started. 'hoy. twelve rack.

Oil war-direction years could have distant. Take the simple matter of a hair-cut. There are only two barbers in the
whole Congo. One is at Elizabethville and the other at Kinshassa, on the Lower Congo, nearly
two thousand miles away. My locks were not shorn for seven weeks. I had to do what little trimming
there was done with a safety razor and it involved quite an acrobatic feat. Take shaving. The
water in most of the Congo rivers is dirty and full of germs. More than once I lathered my
face with mineral water out of a bottle. The Congo River proper is a muddy brown. For washing
purposes it must be treated with a few tablets of permanganate of potassium which colours it
red. It is like bathing in blood.

Since my journey from Katanga onward was through the heart of Africa, perhaps it may be worth
while to tell briefly of the equipment required for such an expedition. Although I travelled
for the most part in the greatest comfort that the Colony afforded, it was necessary to prepare
for any emergency. In the Congo you must be self-sufficient and absolutely independent of the
country. This means that you carry your own bed and bedding (usually a folding camp-bed), bath-tub,
food, medicine-chest, and cooking utensils.

No detail was more essential than the mosquito net under which I slept every night for nearly
four months. Insects are the bane of Africa. The mosquito carries malaria, and the tsetse fly
is the harbinger of that most terrible of diseases, sleeping sickness. Judging from personal
experience nearly every conceivable kind of biting bug infests the Congo. One of the most tenacious
and troublesome of the little visitors is the jigger, which has an uncomfortable habit of seeking
a soft spot under the toe-nail. Once lodged it is extremely difficult to get him out. These
pests are mainly found in sandy soil and give the Negroes who walk about barefooted unending
trouble.

No less destructive is the dazzling sun. Five minutes exposure to it without a helmet means
a prostration and twenty minutes spells death. Stanley called the country so inseparably associated
with his name "Fatal Africa," but he did not mean the death that lay in the murderous black
hand. He had in mind the thousand and one dangers that beset the stranger who does not observe
the strictest rules of health and diet. From the moment of arrival the body undergoes an entirely
new experience. Men succumb because they foolishly think they can continue the habits of civilization.
Alcohol is the curse of all the hot countries. The wise man never takes a drink until the sun
sets and then, if he continues to be wise, he imbibes only in moderation. The morning "peg"
and the lunch-time cocktail have undermined more health in the tropics than all the flies and
mosquitoes combined.

The Duke of Wellington recommended a formula for India which may well be applied to the Congo.
The doughty old warrior once said:

    I know but one recipe for good health in this country, and that is
    to live moderately, to drink little or no wine, to use exercise, to
    keep the mind employed, and, if possible, to keep in good humour
    with the world. The last is the most difficult, for as you have
    often observed, there is scarcely a good-tempered man in India.

If a man will practice moderation in all things, take five grains of quinine every day, exercise
whenever it is possible, and keep his body clean, he has little to fear from the ordinary diseases
of a country like the Congo. It is one of the ironies of civilization that after passing unscathed
through all the fever country, I caught a cold the moment I got back to steam-heat and all
the comforts of home.

No one would think of using ordinary luggage in the Congo. Everything must be packed and conveyed
in metal boxes similar to the uniform cases used by British officers in Egypt and India. This
is because the white ant is the prize destroyer of property throughout Africa. He cuts through
leather and wood with the same ease that a Southern Negro's teeth lacerate watermelon. Leave
a pair of shoes on the ground over night and you will find them riddled in the morning. These
ants eat away floors and sometimes cause the collapse of houses by wearing away the wooden
supports. Another frequent guest is the driver ant, which travels in armies and frequently
takes complete possession of a house. It destroys all the vermin but the human inmates must
beat a retreat while the process goes on.

Since my return many people have asked me what books I read in the Congo. The necessity for
them was apparent. I had more than three months of constant travelling, often alone, and for
the most part on small river boats where there is no deck space for exercise. Mail arrives
irregularly and there were no newspapers. After one or two days the unceasing panorama of tropical
forests, native villages, and naked savages becomes monotonous. Even the hippopotami which
you see in large numbers, the omnipresent crocodile, and the occasional wild elephant, cease
to amuse. You are forced to fall back on that unfailing friend and companion, a good book.

I therefore carried with me the following books in handy volume size:--Montaigne's Essays,
Palgrave's Golden Treasury of English Verse, Lockhart's Life of Napoleon, Autobiography of
Cellini, Don Quixote, The Three Musketeers, Lorna Doone, Prescott's Conquest of Mexico and
The Conquest of Peru, Les Miserables, Vanity Fair, Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin,
Pepys' Diary, Carlyle's French Revolution, The Last of the Mohicans, Westward Ho, Bleak House,
The Pickwick Papers, A Tale of Two Cities, and Tolstoi's War and Peace. When these became exhausted
I was hard put for reading matter. At a post on the Kasai River the only English book I could
find was Arnold Bennett's The Pretty Lady, which had fallen into the hands of an official,
who was trying to learn English with it. It certainly gave him a hectic start.

Then, too, there was the eternal servant problem, no less vexing in that land of servants than
elsewhere. I had cabled to Horner to engage me two personal servants or "boys" as they are
called in Africa. When I got to Elizabethville I found that he had secured two. In addition
to Swahili, the main native tongue in those parts, one spoke English and the other French,
the official language in the Congo. I did not like the looks of the English-speaking barbarian
so I took a chance on Number Two, whose name was Gerome. He was a so-called "educated" native.
I was to find from sad experience that his "education" was largely in the direction of indolence
and inefficiency. I thought that by having a boy with whom I had to speak French I could improve
my command of the language. Later on I realized my mistake because my French is a non-conductor
of profanity.

Gerome had a wife. In the Congo, where all wives are bought, the consort constitutes the husband's
fortune, being cook, tiller of the ground, beast-of-burden and slave generally. I had no desire
to incumber myself with this black Venus, so I made Gerome promise that he would not take her
along. I left him behind at Elizabethville, for I proceeded to Fungurume with Horner by automobile.
He was to follow by train with my luggage and have the private car, which I had chartered for
the journey to Bukama, ready for me on my arrival. When I showed up at Fungurume the first
thing I saw was Gerome's wife, with her ample proportions swathed in scarlet calico, sunning
herself on the platform of the car. He work kant first have chief uncanny when his beast there could

 It was my third change since Bukama
and more were to come before I reached the Lower Congo.

At Kindu I had a rare piece of luck. I fell in with Louis Franck, the Belgian Minister of the
Colonies, to whom I had a letter of introduction, and who was making a tour of inspection of
the Congo. He had landed at Mombassa, crossed British East Africa, visited the new Belgian
possessions of Urundi and Ruanda which are spoils of war, and made his way to Kabalo from Lake
Tanganyika. He asked me to accompany him to Stanleyville as his guest. I gladly accepted because,
aside from the personal compensation afforded by his society, it meant immunity from worry
about the river and train connections.

Franck represents the new type of Colonial Minister. Instead of being a musty bureaucrat, as
so many are, he is a live, alert progressive man of affairs who played a big part in the late
war. To begin with, he is one of the foremost admiralty lawyers of Europe. When the Germans
occupied Belgium he at once became conspicuous. He resisted the Teutonic scheme to separate
the French and Flemish sections of the ravaged country. After the investment of Antwerp, his
native place, accompanied by the Burgomaster and the Spanish Minister, he went to the German
Headquarters and made the arrangement by which the city was saved from destruction by bombardment.
He delayed this parley sufficiently to enable the Belgian Army to escape to the Yser. Subsequently
his activities on behalf of his countrymen made him so distasteful to the Germans that he was
imprisoned in Germany for nearly a year. For two months of this time he shared the noble exile
of Monsieur Max, the heroic Burgomaster of Brussels.

I now became an annex of what amounted to a royal progress. To the Belgian colonial official
and to the native, Franck incarnated a sort of All Highest. In the Congo all functionaries
are called "Bula Matadi," which means "The Rock Breaker." It is the name originally bestowed
on Stanley when he dynamited a road through the rocks of the Lower Congo. Franck, however,
was a super "Bula Matadi." We had a special boat, the "Baron Delbecke," a one hundred ton craft
somewhat similar to the "Louis Cousin" but much cleaner, for she had been scrubbed up for the
journey. The Minister, his military aide, secretary and doctor filled the cabins, so I slept
in a tent set up on the lower deck.

With flags flying and thousands of natives on the shore yelling and beating tom-toms, we started
down the Lualaba. The country between Kindu and Ponthierville, our first objective, is thickly
populated and important settlements dot the banks. Wherever we stopped the native troops were
turned out and there were long speeches of welcome from the local dignitaries. Franck shook
as many black and white hands as an American Presidential candidate would in a swing around
the circle. I accompanied him ashore on all of these state visits and it gave me an excellent
opportunity to see the many types of natives in their Sunday clothes, which largely consist
of no clothes at all. This applies especially to the female sex, which in the Congo reverses
Kipling's theory because they are less deadly than the male.

At Lowa occurred a significant episode. This place is the center of an immense native population,
but there is only one white resident, the usual Belgium state official. We climbed the hill
to his house, where thirty of the leading chiefs, wearing the tin medal which the Belgian Government
gives them, shook hands with the Minister. The ranking chief, distinguished by the extraordinary
amount of red mud in his wool and the grotesque devices cut with a knife on his body, made
a long speech in which he became rather excited. When the agent translated this in French to
Franck I gathered that the people were indignant over the advance in cost of trade goods, especially
salt and calico. Salt is more valuable than gold in the Congo. Among the natives it is legal
tender for every commodity from a handkerchief to a wife.

Franck made a little speech in French in reply--it was translated by the interpreter--in which
he said that the Great War had increased the price of everything. We shook hands all round
and there was much muttering of "yambo," the word for "greeting," and headed for the boat.

Halfway down the hill we heard shouting and hissing. We stopped and looked back. On the crest
were a thousand native women, jeering, hooting, and pointing their fingers at the Minister,
who immediately asked the cause of the demonstration. When the agent called for an explanation
a big black woman said:

"Ask the 'Bula Matadi' why the franc buys so little now? We only get a few goods for a big
lot of money."

I had gone into the wilds to escape from economic unrest and all the confusion that has followed
in its wake, yet here in the heart of Central Africa, I found our old friend the High Cost
of Living working overtime and provoking a spirited protest from primitive savages! It proves
that there is neither caste, creed nor colour-line in the pocket-book. Like indigestion, to
repeat Mr. Pinero, it is the universal leveller of all ranks.

IV

On this trip Franck outlined to me his whole colonial creed. It was a gorgeous June morning
and we had just left a particularly picturesque Arabized village behind us. Hundreds of natives
had come out to welcome the Minister in canoes. They sang songs and played their crude musical
instruments as they swept alongside our boat. We now sat on the upper deck and watched the
unending panorama of palm trees with here and there a clump of grass huts.

"All colonial development is a chain which is no stronger than its weakest link and that is
the native," said the Minister. "As you build the native, so do you build the whole colonial
structure. Hence the importance of a high moral standard. You must conform to the native's
traditions, mentality and temperament. Give him a technical education something like that afforded
by Booker Washington's Tuskegee Institute. Show him how to use his hands. He will then become
efficient and therefore contented. It is a mistake to teach him a European language. I prefer
him to be a first-class African rather than third-class European.

"The hope of the Congo lies in industrialization on the one hand, and the creation of new wealth
on the other. By new wealth I mean such new crops as cotton and a larger exploitation of such
old products as rice and palm fruit. Rubber has become a second industry although the cultivated
plantations are in part taking the place of the old wild forests. The substitute for rubber
as the first product of the land is the fruit of the oil palm tree. This will be the industrial
staple of the Congo. I believe, however, that in time cotton can be produced in large commercial
quantities over a wide area."

Franck now turned to a subject which reflects his courage and progressiveness. He said, "There
is a strong tendency in other Colonies to give too large a place to State enterprise. The result
of this system is that officers are burdened with an impossible task. They must look after
the railways, steamers, mills, and a variety of tasks for which they often lack the technical
knowledge.

"I have made it a point to give first place to private enterprise and to transfer those activities
formerly under State rule to autonomous enterprises in which the State has an interest. They
are run by business men along business lines as business institutions. The State's principal
function in them is to protect the native employes. The gold mines at Kilo are an example.
They are still owned by the State but are worked by a private company whose directors have
full powers. The reason why the State does not part with its ownership of these mines is that
it does not want a rush of gold-seekers. State who was favorite places, and looked of Congo be on egg

Navigation, or may be misunderstood. Who had one,--.
 In the midst of the multitude he was alone. He shunned intimacy and one of his mournful
reflections was, "I have had no friend on any expedition, no one who could possibly be my companion
on an equal footing, except while with Livingstone."

I cannot resist the impulse to make comparison between those two outstanding Englishmen, Rhodes
and Stanley, whose lives are intimately woven into the fabric of African romance. They had
much in common and yet they were widely different in purpose and temperament. Each was an autocrat
and brooked no interference. Each had the same kindling ideal of British imperialism. Each
suffered abuse at the hands of his countrymen and lived to witness a triumphant vindication.

Stanley had a rare talent for details--he went on the theory that if you wanted a thing done
properly you must do it yourself--but Rhodes only saw things in a big way and left the interpretation
to subordinates. Stanley was devoutly religious while Rhodes paid scant attention to the spiritual
side. Each was a dreamer in his own way and merely regarded money as a means to an end. Rhodes,
however, was far more disdainful of wealth as such, than Stanley, who received large sums for
his books and lectures. It is only fair to him to say that he never took pecuniary advantage
of the immense opportunities that his explorations in the Congo afforded.

Still another intrepid Englishman narrowly missed having a big rôle in the drama of the Congo.
General Gordon agreed to assume the Governorship of the Lower Congo under Stanley, who was
to be the Chief Administrator of the Upper Congo. They were to unite in one grand effort to
crush the slave trade. Especially is not give at deep is not ask a retentive the roadblock, it was sunk

 He always sends one of his servants. As soon as the vendor knows
that the servant is in the white employ he shoves up the price. I discovered this state of
affairs as soon as I started down the Lualaba. In my innocence I paid two francs for a bunch
of bananas. The moment I had closed the deal I observed larger and better bunches being purchased
by natives for fifty centimes.

This business of profiteering by the natives is no new phase of life in the Congo. Stanley
discovered it to his cost. Sir Harry Johnston, the distinguished explorer and administrator,
who added to his achievements during these past years by displaying skill and brilliancy as
a novelist, tells a characteristic story that throws light on the subject. It deals with one
of the experiences of George Grenfell, the eminent British missionary who gave thirty years
of his unselfish life to work in the Congo. On one of his trips he noticed the corpse of a
woman hanging from the branches of a tree over the water of the great river. At first he thought
that she had been executed as a punishment for adultery, one of the most serious crimes in
the native calendar. On investigation he found that she had been guilty of a much more serious
offense. A law had been imposed that all goods, especially food, must be sold to the white
man at a far higher price than the local market value. This unhappy woman had only doubled
the quotation for eggs, had been convicted of breaking the code, and had suffered death in
consequence.

Since I have referred to adultery, let me point out a situation that does not reflect particular
credit on so-called civilization. Before the white man came to Africa chastity was held in
deepest reverence. The usual punishment for infidelity was death. Some of the early white men
were more or less promiscuous and set a bad moral example with regard to the women. The native
believed that in this respect "the white man can do no wrong" and the inevitable laxity resulted.
When a woman deserts her husband now all she gets is a sound beating. If a man elopes with
the wife of a friend, he is haled before a magistrate and fined.

III

On the Congo I got my first glimpse of the native fashion in mourning. It is a survival of
the biblical "sackcloth and ashes." As soon as a death occurs all the members of the family
smear their faces and bodies with ashes or dirt. Even the babies show these rude symbols of
woe. It gives the person thus adorned a weird and ghastly appearance. When ashes and dust are
not available for this purpose, a substitute is found in filthy mud. The mourner is not permitted
to wash throughout the entire period of grief, which ranges from thirty to ninety days.

Like the Southern Negro in America these African natives are not only born actors but have
a keen sense of humour. They are quick to imitate the white man. If a Georgia darkey, for example,
wants to abuse a member of his own race he delights to call him "a fool nigger." It is the
last word in reproach. In the Congo when a native desires to express contempt for his fellow,
he refers to him as a basingi, which means bush-man. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle
black.

Up the Kasai I heard a story that admirably illustrates the native humour. A Belgian official
much inclined to corpulency came out to take charge of a post. After the usual fashion, he
received a native name the moment he arrived. It is not surprising that he became known as
Mafutta Mingi. As soon as he learned what it meant he became indignant. Like most fat men he
could not persuade himself that he was fat. He demanded that he be given another title, whereupon
the local chief solemnly dubbed him Kiboko. The official was immediately appeased. He noticed
that a broad smile invariably illumined the countenance of the person who addressed him in
this way. On investigation he discovered that the word meant hippopotamus.

The Congo native delights in argument. Here you get another parallel with his American brother.
A Bangala, for example, will talk for a week about five centimes. One day at Dima I heard a
terrific shouting and exhorting down at the native market which is held twice a week. I was
certain that someone was being murdered. When I arrived on the scene I saw a hundred men and
women gesticulating wildly and in a great state of excitement. I learned that the wife of a
wood-boy on a boat had either secreted or sold a scrap of soap, and her husband was not only
berating her with his tongue but telling the whole community about it.

The chief function of most Belgian officials in the Congo is to preside at what is technically
known as a "palaver." This word means conference but it actually develops into a free-for-all
riotous protestation by the natives involved. They all want to talk at the same time and it
is like an Irish debating society. Years ago each village had a "palaver ground," where the
chief sat in solemn judgment on the disputes of his henchmen. Now the "palavers" are held before
Government officers. Most of the "palavers" that I heard related to elopements. No matter how
grievous was the offense of the male he invariably shifted the entire responsibility to the
woman. He was merely emulating the ways of civilization.

Between Stanleyville and Kinshassa we not only stopped every night according to custom, but
halted at not less than a dozen settlements to take on or deliver cargo. These stations resemble
each other in that they are mainly a cluster of stores owned or operated by agents of various
trading companies. Practically every post in the Congo has, in addition, a shop owned by a
Portuguese. You find these traders everywhere. They have something of the spirit of adventure
and the hardihood of their doughty ancestors who planted the flag of Portugal on the high seas
back in that era when the little kingdom was a world power.

Some of them have been in the Congo for fifteen and twenty years without ever stirring outside
its confines. On the steamer that took me to Europe from the Congo was a Portuguese who had
lived in the bush for twenty-two years. When he got on the big steamer he was frightened at
the noise and practically remained in his cabin throughout the entire voyage. As we neared
France he told me that if he had realized beforehand the terror and tumult of the civilization
that he had forgotten, he never would have departed from his jungle home. He was as shy as
a wild animal.

One settlement, Basoko, has a tragic meaning for the Anglo-Saxon. Here died and lies buried,
the gallant Grenfell. I doubt if exploration anywhere revealed a nobler character than this
Baptist minister whose career has been so adequately presented by Sir Harry Johnston, and who
ranks with Stanley and Livingstone as one of the foremost of African explorers. In the Congo
evangelization has been fraught with a truly noble fortitude. When you see the handicaps that
have beset both Catholic and Protestant missionaries you are filled with a new appreciation
of their calling.

The most important stop of this trip was at Coquilhatville, named in honor of Captain Coquilhat,
one of the most courageous of the early Belgian soldier-explorers. It was the original Equatorville
(it is at the point where the Equator cuts the Congo), founded by Stanley when he established
the series of stations under the auspices of the International African Association. Here dwells
the Vice-Governor of the Equatorial Province. Near by is a botanical garden maintained by the
Colonial Government and which contains specimens of all the flora of Central Africa.

At Coquilhatville I saw the first horse since I left Rhodesia and it was a distinct event.
Except in the Kasai region it is impossible to maintain live stock in the Congo. The tsetse
fly is the devastating agency. Apparently the only beasts able to withstand this scourge are
goats and dogs. The few white men who live in Coquilhatville have been able to maintain five
horses which are used by the so-called Riding Club. These animals provide the only exercise
at the post. They are owned and ridden by the handful of Englishmen there. A man must drive
himself to indulge in any form of outdoor sport along the equator. The climate is more or less
enervating and it takes real Anglo-Saxon energy to resist the lure of the siesta or to remain
in bed as long as possible.

Bolobo is a reminder of Stanley. He had more trouble here than at any of the many stations
he set up in the Congo Free State in the early eighties. The natives were hostile, the men
he left in charge proved to be inefficient, and on two occasions the settlement was burned
to the ground. Today it is the seat of one of the largest and most prosperous of all the English
Baptist Congo missions and is presided over by a Congo veteran, Dr. Stonelake. One feature
of the work here is a manual training school for natives, who manufacture the same kind of
wicker chairs that the tourist buys at Madeira.

The farther I travelled in the Congo the more deeply I became interested in the native habits
and customs. Although cluttered with ignorance and superstition the barbaric mind is strangely
productive of a rude philosophy which is expressed in a quaint folklore. Seasoned Congo travellers
like Grenfell, Stanley, Ward, and Johnston have all recorded fascinating local legends. I heard
many of these tales myself and I shall endeavour to relate the best.

Some of the most characteristic stories deal with the origin of death. Here is a Bangala tradition
gathered by Grenfell and which runs as follows:

    The natives say that in the beginning men and women did not die.
    That one day, Nza Komba (God) came bringing two gifts, a large and
    a small one. If they chose the smaller one they would continue to
    live, but if the larger one, they would for a time enjoy much
    greater wealth, but they would afterwards die. The men said they
    must consider the matter, and went away to drink water, as the
    Kongos say. While they were discussing the matter the women took the
    larger gift, and Nza Komba went back with the little one. He has
    never been seen since, though they cried and cried for Him to come
    back and take the big bundle and give them the little one, and with
    it immortality.

The Baluba version of the great mystery is set forth in this way:

    God (Kabezya-unpungu) created the sun, moon, and stars, then the
    world, and later the plants and animals. When all this was finished
    He placed a man and two women in the world and taught them the name
    and use of all things. He gave an axe and a knife to the man, and
    taught him to cut wood, weave stuffs, melt iron, and to hunt and
    fish. To the women he gave a pickaxe and a knife. He taught both of
    them to till the ground, make pottery, weave baskets, make
    oil,--that is to say, all that custom assigns to them to-day.

    These first inhabitants of the earth lived happily for a long time
    until one of the women began to grow old. God, foreseeing this, had
    given her the gift of rejuvenating herself, and the faculty, if she
    once succeeded, of preserving the gift for herself and for all
    mankind. Unfortunately, she speedily lost the precious treasure and
    introduced death into the world.

    This is how the misfortune occurred: Seeing herself all withered,
    the woman took the fan with which her companion had been winnowing
    maize for the manufacture of beer and shut herself into her hut,
    carefully closing the door. There she began to tear off her old
    skin, throwing it on the fan. The skin came off easily, a new one
    appearing in its place. The operation was nearing completion. There
    remained the head and neck only when her companion came to the hut
    to fetch her fan and before the old woman could speak, pushed open
    the door. The almost rejuvenated woman fell dead instantly.

    This is the reason we all die. The two survivors gave birth to a
    number of sons and daughters, from whom all races have descended.
    Since that time God does not trouble about His creatures. He is
    satisfied with visiting them incognito now and again. Wherever He
    passes the ground sinks. He injures no one. It is therefore
    superfluous to honour him, so the Balubas offer no worship to Him.

The animal story has a high place in the legends of these peoples. They represent a combination
of Kipling's Jungle Book, Aesop's Fables, and Br'er Rabbit. Nor do they fail to point a moral.
Naturally, the elephant is a conspicuous feature in most of them. The tale of "The Elephant
and the Shrew" will illustrate. Here it is:

    One day the elephant met the shrew mouse on his road. "Out of the
    way," cried the latter. "I am the bigger, and it is your place to
    look out," replied the monster. "Curse you!" retorted the shrew
    mouse furiously. "May the long grass cut your legs!" "And may you
    meet your death when you walk in the road!" replied the other
    crushing him under his huge foot. Both curses have been fulfilled.
    From that day the elephant wounds himself when he goes through the
    long grass, and the shrew-mouse meets her death when she crosses the
    road.

The story of the elephant and the chameleon is equally interesting. One day the chameleon challenged
the elephant to a race. For subscribe sooner always, it are now of agony, in set but rule were

Now for the last stage of the Congo River trip. Like so many of my other experiences in Africa
it produced a surprise. One morning when we were about two hundred miles north of Kinshassa
I heard the whir of a motor engine, a rare sound in those parts. I thought of aeroplanes and
instinctively looked up. Flying overhead toward Coquilhatville was a 300-horse power hydroplane

Kinshassa is situated on Stanley Pool, a lake-like expansion of the Congo more than two hundred
square miles in area. It is dotted with islands. Nearly one-third of the northern shore is
occupied by the rocky formations that Stanley named Dover Cliffs. They reminded him of the
famous white cliffs of England and with the sunlight on them they do bear a strong resemblance
to one of the familiar signposts of Albion. More than one Englishman emerging from the jungle
after long service remote from civilization has gotten a thrill of home at the name and sight
of these hills.

Stanley Pool has always been associated in my mind with one of the most picturesque episodes
in Stanley's life. He tells about it in his monumental work on the Congo Free State and again
relates it in his Autobiography. It deals with Ngalyema, who was chief of the Stanley Pool
District in the early eighties. He demanded and received a large quantity of goods for the
permission to establish a station here. After the explorer had camped within ten miles of the
Pool the old pirate pretended that he had not received the goods and sought to extort more.
Stanley refused to be bullied, whereupon the chief threatened to attack him in force. Let Stanley
now tell the story, for it is an illustration of the way he combated the usury and cunning
of the Congo native.

    I had hung a great Chinese gong conspicuously near the principal
    tent. Ngalyema's curiosity would be roused. All my men were hidden,
    some in the steamboat on top of the wagon, and in its shadow was a
    cool place where the warriors would gladly rest after a ten-mile
    march. Other of my men lay still as death under tarpaulins, under
    bundles of grass, and in the bush round about the camp. By the time
    the drum-taps and horns announced Ngalyema's arrival, the camp
    seemed abandoned except by myself and a few small boys. I was
    indolently seated in a chair reading a book, and appeared too lazy
    to notice anyone; but, suddenly looking up and seeing my "brother
    Ngalyema" and his warriors, scowlingly regarding me, I sprang up and
    seized his hands, and affectionately bade him welcome, in the name
    of sacred fraternity, and offered him my own chair.

    He was strangely cold, and apparently disgruntled, and said:--

    "Has not my brother forgotten his road? What does he mean by coming
    to this country?"

    "Nay, it is Ngalyema who has forgotten the blood-bond which exists
    between us. It is Ngalyema who has forgotten the mountains of goods
    which I paid him. What words are these of my brother?"

    "Be warned, Rock-Breaker. Go back before it is too late. My elders
    and people all cry out against allowing the white man to come into
    our country. Therefore, go back before it be too late. Go back, I
    say, the way you came."

    Speech and counter-speech followed. Ngalyema had exhausted his
    arguments; but it was not easy to break faith and be uncivil, with
    plausible excuse. His eyes were reaching round seeking to discover
    an excuse to fight, when they rested on the round, burnished face of
    the Chinese gong.

    "What is that?" he said.

    "Ah, that--that is a fetish."

    "A fetish! A fetish for what?"

    "It is a war-fetish, Ngalyema. The slightest sound of that would
    fill this empty camp with hundreds of angry warriors; they would
    drop from above, they would spring up from the ground, from the
    forest about, from everywhere."

    "Sho! Tell that story to the old women, and not to a chief like
    Ngalyema. My boy tells me it is a kind of a bell. Strike it and let
    me hear it."

    "Oh, Ngalyema, my brother, the consequences would be too dreadful!
    Do not think of such a thing!"

    "Strike it, I say."

    "Well, to oblige my dear brother Ngalyema, I will."

    And I struck hard and fast, and the clangourous roll rang out like
    thunder in the stillness. Only for a few seconds, however, for a
    tempest of human voices was heard bursting into frightful discords,
    and from above, right upon the heads of the astonished warriors,
    leaped yelling men; and from the tents, the huts, the forest round
    about, they came by sixes, dozens, and scores, yelling like madmen,
    and seemingly animated with uncontrollable rage. The painted
    warriors became panic-stricken; they flung their guns and
    powder-kegs away, forgot their chief, and all thoughts of loyalty,
    and fled on the instant, fear lifting their heels high in the air;
    or, tugging at their eye-balls, and kneading the senses confusedly,
    they saw, heard, and suspected nothing, save that the limbo of
    fetishes had suddenly broken loose!

    But Ngalyema and his son did not fly. They caught the tails of my
    coat, and we began to dance from side to side, a loving triplet,
    myself being foremost to ward off the blow savagely aimed at my
    "brothers," and cheerfully crying out, "Hold fast to me, my
    brothers. I will defend you to the last drop of my blood. Come one,
    come all."

    Presently the order was given, "Fall in!" and quickly the leaping
    forms became rigid, and the men stood in two long lines in beautiful
    order, with eyes front, as though "at attention!" Composure to analyze
    what was churn in cookware, he show his liking, he mean to killing.
    Him realize big ammunition might be utilize for intent, it is likely,
    append to his observance, he will be enabled to decoupage of churn

 After his first audience with the Belgian
king Rhodes said to Robert Williams, "I thought I was clever but I was no match for him."

The only other modern king interested in business was the former Kaiser, Mr. Wilhelm Hohenzollern.
Although he has no business sense in the way that Leopold had it, he always had a keen appreciation
of big business as an imperial prop. Like Leopold, he had a congested country and realized
that permanent expansion lay in colonization. The commercial magnates of Germany used him for
their own ends but their teamwork advanced the whole empire. Wilhelm was a silent partner in
the potash, shipping, and electric-machinery trusts. He earned whatever he received because
he was in every sense an exalted press-agent,--a sort of glorified publicity promoter. His
strong point was to go about proclaiming the merits of German wares and he always made it a
point to scatter samples. On a visit to Italy he left behind a considerable quantity of soap.
There was a great rush to get these royal left-overs. Two weeks later a small army of German
soap salesmen descended upon the country selling this identical product.

Whatever may be said of Leopold, one thing is certain. He was not small. Wilhelm used the brains
of other men; Leopold employed his own, and every capitalist who went up against him paid tribute
to this asset.

We can now go back to 1906, the year that was to mark the advent of America into the Congo.
Leopold knew that the days of the Congo as a Free State were numbered. His personally-conducted
stewardship of the Colony was being assailed by the Socialists on one hand and the atrocity
proclaimers on the other. Leopold was undoubtedly sincere in his desire to economically safeguard
the African possession before it passed out of his control. In any event, during the summer
of that year he sent a message to Ryan asking him to confer with him at Brussels. The summons
came out of a clear sky and at first the American financier paid no attention to it. He was
then on a holiday in Switzerland. When a second invitation came from the king, he accepted,
and in September there began a series of meetings between the two men which resulted in the
organization of the Forminiere and with it the dawn of a real international epoch in American
enterprise.

In the light of our immense riches the timidity of American capital in actual constructive
enterprise overseas is astonishing. Scrutinize the world business map and you see how shy it
has been. We own rubber plantations in Sumatra, copper mines in Chile, gold interests in Ecuador,
and have dabbled in Russian and Siberian mining. These undertakings are slight, however, compared
with the scope of the world field and our own wealth. Mexico, where we have extensive smelting,
oil, rubber, mining and agricultural investments, is so close at hand that it scarcely seems
like a foreign country. Strangely enough our capital there has suffered more than in any other
part of the globe. The spectacle of American pioneering in the Congo therefore takes on a peculiar
significance.

There are two reasons why our capital has not wandered far afield. One is that we have a great
country with enormous resources and consequently almost unlimited opportunities for the employment
of cash at home. The other lies in the fact that American capital abroad is not afforded the
same protection granted the money of other countries. Take British capital. It is probably
the most courageous of all. The sun never sets on it. England is a small country and her money,
to spread its wings, must go elsewhere. Moreover, Britain zealously safeguards her Nationals
and their investments, and we, I regret to say, have not always done likewise. The moment an
Englishman or the English flag is insulted a warship speeds to the spot and John Bull wants
to know the reason why.

Why did Leopold seek American capital and why did he pick out Thomas F. Ryan? There are several
motives and I will deal with them in order. In the first place American capital is about the
only non-political money in the world. The English pound, for example, always flies the Union
Jack and is a highly sensitive commodity. When England puts money into an enterprise she immediately
makes the Foreign Office an accessory. German overseas enterprise is even more meddlesome.
It has always been the first aid to poisonous and pernicious penetration. Even French capital
is flavoured with imperialism despite the fact that it is the product of a democracy. Our dollars
are not hitched to the star of empire. We have no dreams of world conquest. It is the safest
politically to deal with, and Leopold recognized this fact.

In the second place he did not want anything to interfere with his Congo rubber industry. Now
we get to the real reason, perhaps, why he sent for Ryan. In conjunction with the late Senator
Nelson W. Aldrich, Ryan had developed the rubber industry in Mexico, by extracting rubber from
the guayele shrub which grows wild in the desert. Leopold knew this--he had a way of finding
out about things--and he sought to kill two birds with one stone. He wanted this Mexican process
and at the same time he needed capital for the Congo. In any event, Ryan went to see him and
the Forminiere was born.

There is no need of rehearsing here the concrete details of this enterprise. All we want are
the essential facts. Leopold realized that the Forminiere was the last business venture of
his life and he projected it on a truly kingly scale. It was the final chance for huge grants
and the result was that the Forminiere received the mining and mineral rights to more than
7,000,000 acres, and other concessions for agriculture aggregating 2,500,000 acres in addition.

The original capital was only 3,000,000 francs but this has been increased from time to time
until it is now more than 10,000,000 francs. Evening, gauge was out. I. Hatchets, knives, and nails,

 In informal Congo history this engagement is known as "The Battle
of Ball's Run," although Ball did no running. As recently as 1915 one of the Forminiere prospectors,
E. G. Decker, was killed by the fierce Batshoks, the most belligerent of the Upper Kasai tribes.
The Ball-Mohun group, which was the first of many expeditions, remained in the field more than
two years and covered a wide area.

Up to this time gold and copper were the only valuable minerals that had been discovered in
the Congo and the Americans naturally went after them. Much to their surprise, they found diamonds
and thereby opened up a fresh source of wealth for the Colony. The first diamond was found
at Mai Munene, which means "Big Water," a considerable waterfall discovered by Livingstone.
This region, which is watered by the Kasai River, became the center of what is now known as
the Congo Diamond Fields and remains the stronghold of American engineering and financial enterprise
in Central Africa. On a wooded height not far from the headwaters of the Kasai, these path-finding
Americans established a post called Tshikapa, the name of a small river nearby. It is the capital
of Little America in the jungle and therefore became the objective of the second stage of my
Congo journey.

III

Kinshassa is nearly a thousand miles from Tshikapa. To get there I had to retrace my way up
the Congo as far as Kwamouth, where the Kasai empties into the parent stream. I also found
that it was necessary to change boats at Dima and continue on the Kasai to Djoko Punda. Here
begins the jungle road to the diamond fields.

Up to this time I had enjoyed the best facilities that the Congo could supply in the way of
transport. Now I faced a trip that would not only try patience but had every element of the
unknown, which in the Congo means the uncomfortable. Fortunately, the "Lusanga," one of the
Huileries du Congo Belge steamers, was about to start for the Kwilu River, which branches off
from the Kasai, and the company was kind enough to order it to take me to Dima, which was off
the prescribed itinerary of the vessel.

On a brilliant morning at the end of June I set forth. Nelson was still my faithful servant
and his smile and teeth shone as resplendently as ever. The only change in him was that his
appetite for chikwanga had visibly increased. Somebody had told him at Kinshassa that the Kasai
country teemed with cannibals. Being one of the world's champion eaters, he shrank from being
eaten himself. I promised him an extra allowance of food and a khaki uniform that I had worn
in the war, and he agreed to take a chance.

Right here let me give an evidence of the Congo native's astounding quickness to grasp things.
I do not refer to his light-fingered propensities, however. When we got to Kinshassa Nelson
knew scarcely a word of the local dialect. When we left a week later, he could jabber intelligently
with any savage he met. On the four weeks' trip from Elizabethville he had picked up enough
French to make himself understood. The Central African native has an aptitude for languages
that far surpasses that of the average white man.

I was the only passenger on the "Lusanga," which had been reconstructed for Lord Leverhulme's
trip through the Congo in 1914. I occupied the suite installed for him and it was my last taste
of luxury for many a day. The captain, Albert Carrie, was a retired lieutenant in the British
Royal Navy, and the chief engineer was a Scotchman. The Congo River seemed like an old friend
as we steamed up toward Kwamouth. As soon as we turned into the Kasai I found that conditions
were different than on the main river. There was an abundance of fuel, both for man and boat.
The daily goat steak of the Congo was relieved by duck and fish. The Kasai region is thickly
populated and I saw a new type of native, lighter in colour than elsewhere, and more keen and
intelligent.

The women of the Kasai are probably the most attractive in the Congo. This applies particularly
to the Batetelas, who are of light brown colour. From childhood the females of this tribe have
a sense of modesty that is in sharp contrast with the nudity that prevails elsewhere throughout
the country. They swathe their bodies from neck to ankle with gaily coloured calico. I am often
asked if the scant attire in Central Africa shocked me. I invariably reply by saying that the
contemporary feminine fashion of near-undress in America and Europe made me feel that some
of the chocolate-hued ladies of the jungle were almost over-clothed!

 Fifteen years ago Dima was the wildest kind of jungle. I found
it a model, tropical post with dozens of brick houses, a shipyard and machine shops, avenues
of palm trees and a farm. It is the headquarters of the Kasai Company in the Congo.

I had a brick bungalow to myself and ate with the Managing Director, Monsieur Adrian Van den
Hove. He knew no English and my alleged French was pretty bad. Yet we met three times a day
at the table and carried on spirited conversations. There was only one English-speaking person
within a radius of a hundred miles and I had read all my English books. I vented my impatience
in walking, for I covered at least fifteen miles through the jungle every day. This proceeding
filled both the Belgians and the natives with astonishment. The latter particularly could not
understand why a man walked about the country aimlessly. Usually a native will only walk when
he can move in the direction of food or sleep. On these solitary trips I went through a country
that still abounds in buffalo. Occasionally you see an elephant. It is one thing to watch a
big tusker doing his tricks in a circus tent, but quite another to hear him floundering through
the woods, tearing off huge branches of trees as he moves along with what seems to be an incredible
speed for so heavy an animal.

There came the glad Sunday--it was my thirteenth day at Dima--when I heard the whistle of the
steamboat. I dashed down to the beach and there was the little forty-ton "Madeleine." I welcomed
her as a long-lost friend and this she proved to be. The second day afterwards I went aboard
and began a diverting chapter of my experience. The "Madeleine" is a type of the veteran Congo
boat. In the old days the Belgian pioneers fought natives from its narrow deck. Despite incessant
combat with sand-banks, snags and swift currents--all these obstructions abound in the Kasai
River--she was still staunch. In command was the only Belgian captain that I had in the Congo,
and he had been on these waters for twenty years with only one holiday in Europe during the
entire time.

I occupied the alleged cabin-de-luxe, the large room that all these boats must furnish in case
an important State functionary wants to travel. But there is no intelligence could honor bouncer. We thus

 Between Djoko Punda and Tshikapa the material is hauled
in motor trucks and ox-drawn wagons or conveyed on the heads of porters to Kabambaie. Some
of it is transshipped to whale-boats and paddled up to Tshikapa, and the remainder continues
in the wagons overland. During 1920 seven hundred and fifty tons of freight were hauled from
Djoko Punda in this laborious way.

At the time of my visit there were twelve going mines in the Congo field, and three new ones
were in various stages of advancement. The Forminiere engineers also operate the diamond concessions
of the Kasai Company and the Bas Congo Katanga Railway which will run from the Katanga to Kinshassa.

More than twelve thousand natives are employed throughout the Congo area alone and nowhere
have I seen a more contented lot of blacks. The Forminiere obtains this good-will by wisely
keeping the price of trade goods such as salt and calico at the pre-war rate. It is an admirable
investment. This merchandise is practically the legal tender of the jungle. With a cup of salt
a black man can start an endless chain of trading that will net him a considerable assortment
of articles in time.

The principal natives in the Upper Kasai are the Balubas, who bear the same relation to this
area as the Bangalas do to the Upper Congo. The men are big, strong, and fairly intelligent.
The principal tribal mark is the absence of the two upper central incisor teeth. These are
usually knocked out in early boyhood. No Baluba can marry until he can show this gaping space
in his mouth. Although the natives abuse their teeth by removing them or filing them down to
points, they take excellent care of the remaining ivories. Many polish the teeth with a stick
and wash their mouths several times a day. The same cannot be said of many civilized persons.

I observed that the families in the Upper Kasai were much more numerous than elsewhere in the
Congo. A Bangala or Batetela woman usually has one child and then goes out of the baby business.
In the region dominated by the Forminiere it is no infrequent thing to see three or four children
in a household. A woman who bears twins is not only hailed as a real benefactress but the village
looks upon the occasion as a good omen. This is in direct contrast with the state of mind in
East Africa, for example, where one twin is invariably killed.

I encountered an interesting situation concerning twins when I visited the Mabonda Mine. This
is one of the largest in the Congo field. Barclay, the big-boned American manager, formerly
conducted engineering operations in the southern part of America. He therefore knows the Negro
psychology and the result is that he conducts a sort of amiable and paternalistic little kingdom
all his own. The natives all come to him with their troubles, and he is their friend, philosopher
and guide.

After lunch one day he asked me if I would like to talk to a native who had a story. When I
expressed assent he took me out to a shed nearby and there I saw a husky Baluba who was labouring
under some excitement. The reason was droll. Four days before, his wife had given birth to
twins and there was great excitement in the village. The natives, however, refused to have
anything to do with him because, to use their phrase, "he was too strong." His wife did not
come under this ban and was the center of jubilation and gesticulation. The poor husband was
a sort of heroic outcast and had to come to Barclay to get some food and a drink of palm wine
to revive his drooping spirits.

The output in the Congo diamond area has grown from a few thousand karats to hundreds of thousands
of karats a year. The stones are small but clear and brilliant. This yield is an unsatisfactory
evidence of the richness of the domain. The ore reserves are more than ten per cent of the
yearly output and the surface of the concession has scarcely been scratched. Experienced diamond
men say that a diamond in the ground is worth two in the market. It is this element of the
unknown that gives the Congo field one of its principal potentialities.

The Congo diamond fields are merely a part of the Forminiere treasure-trove. Over in Angola
the concession is eight times larger in area, the stones are bigger, and with adequate exploitation
should surpass the parent production in a few years. Six mines are already in operation and
three more have been staked out. The Angola mines are alluvial and are operated precisely like
those in Belgian territory. The managing engineer is Glenn H. Newport, who was with Decker
in the fatal encounter with Batchoks. The principal post of this area is Dundu, which is about
forty miles from the Congo border.

As I looked at these mines with their thousands of grinning natives and heard the rattle of
gravel in the "jigs" my mind went back to Kimberley and the immense part that its glittering
wealth played in determining the economic fate of South Africa. Long before the gold "rush"
opened up in the Rand, the diamond mines had given the southern section of the continent a
rebirth of prosperity. Will the Congo mines perform the same service for the Congo? In any
event they will be a determining factor in the future world diamond output.

No record of America in the Congo would be complete without a reference to the high part that
our missionaries have played in the spiritualization of the land. The stronghold of our religious
influence is also the Upper Kasai Basin. In 1890 two devoted men, Samuel N. Lapsley, a white
clergyman, and William H. Sheppard, a Negro from Alabama, established the American Presbyterian
Congo Mission at Luebo which is about one hundred miles from Tshikapa straight across country.

The valley of the Sankuru and Kasai Rivers is one of the most densely populated of all the
Belgian Congo. It is inhabited by five powerful tribes--the Baluba, the Bena Lulua, the Bakuba,
the Bakete and the Zappozaps, and their united population is one-fifth of that of the whole
Colony. Hence it was a fruitful field for labour but a hard one. From an humble beginning the
work has grown until there are now seven important stations with scores of white workers, hundreds
of native evangelists, one of the best equipped hospitals in Africa, and a manual training
school that is teaching the youth of the land how to become prosperous and constructive citizens.
Under its inspiration the population of Luebo has grown from two thousand in 1890 to eighteen
thousand in 1920.

The two fundamental principles underlying this splendid undertaking have been well summed up
as follows: "First, the attainment of a Church supported by the natives through the thrift
and industry of their own hands. The time is past when we may merely teach the native to become
a Christian and then leave him in his poverty and squalor where he can be of little or no use
to the Church. Second, the preparation of the native to take the largest and most influential
position possible in the development of the Colony. Practically the only thing open to the
Congolese is along the mechanical and manual lines."

One of the noblest actors in this American missionary drama was the late Rev. W. M. Morrison,
who went out to the Congo in 1896. Realizing that the most urgent need was a native dictionary,
he reduced the Baluba-Lulua language to writing. In 1906 he published a Dictionary and Grammar
which included the Parables of Christ, the Miracles, the Epistles to the Romans in paraphrase.
He also prepared a Catechism based on the Shorter and Child's Catechisms. This gave the workers
in the field a definite instrument to employ, and it has been a beneficent influence in shaping
the lives and morals of the natives.

One phase of the labours of the American Presbyterian Congo Mission discloses the bondage of
the Congo native to the Witch Doctor. The moment he feels sick he rushes to the sorcerer, usually
a bedaubed barbarian who practices weird and mysterious rites, and who generally succeeds in
killing off his patient. More than ninety per cent of the pagan population of Africa not only
acknowledges but fears the powers of the Witch Doctor. Only two-fifths of one per cent are
under Christian medical treatment. The Presbyterian Missionaries, therefore, from the very
outset have sought to bring the native into the ken of the white physician. It is a slow process.
One almost unsurmountable obstacle lies in the uncanny grip that the "medicine man" wields
in all the tribes.

It is largely due to the missionaries that the practice of handshaking has been introduced
in the Congo. Formerly the custom was to clap hands when exchanging greetings. The blacks saw
the Anglo-Saxons grasp hands when they met and being apt imitators in many things, they started
to do likewise. One of the first things that impressed me in Africa was the extraordinary amount
of handshaking that went on when the people met each other even after a separation of only
half an hour.

I had originally planned to leave Africa at St. Paul de Loanda in Portuguese West Africa, where
Thomas F. Ryan and his Belgian associates have acquired the new oil wells and set up still
another important outpost of our overseas financial venturing. But so much time had been consumed
in reaching Tshikapa that I determined to return to Kinshassa, go on to Matadi, and catch the
boat for Europe at the end of August.

There were two ways of getting back to Kabambaie. One was to go in an automobile through the
jungle, and the other by boat down the Kasai. Between Kabambaie and Djoko Punda there is practically
no navigation on account of the succession of dangerous rapids. Since my faith in the jitney
was still impaired I chose the river route and it gave me the most stirring of all my African
experiences. The two motor boats at Tshikapa were out of commission so I started at daybreak
in a whale-boat manned by forty naked native paddlers.

The fog still hung over the countryside and the scene as we got under way was like a Rackham
drawing of goblins and ghosts. I sat forward in the boat with the ranks of singing, paddling
blacks behind me. From the moment we started and until I landed, the boys kept up an incessant
chanting. One of their number sat forward and pounded the iron gunwale with a heavy stick.
When he stopped pounding the paddlers ceased their efforts. The only way to make the Congo
native work is to provide him with noise.

All day we travelled down the river through schools of hippopotami, some of them near enough
for me to throw a stone into the cavernous mouths. The boat capita told me that he would get
to Kabambaie by sundown. Like the average New York restaurant waiter, he merely said what he
thought his listener wanted to hear. I fervently hoped he was right because we not only had
a series of rapids to shoot up-river, but at Kabambaie is a seething whirlpool that has engulfed
hundreds of natives and their boats. When he did not have the secession, which travel short to

 It was quaintly amusing to hear her jabber with the wood-boys and

The Cranes were splendid types of the American missionary workers for they were human and companionable.
I had found Cleveland of the same calibre. Like many other men I had an innate prejudice against
the foreign church worker before I went to Africa. I left with a strong admiration for him,
and with it a profound respect.

Kinshassa looked good to me when we arrived after four days' travelling, but I did not tarry
long. I was relieved to find that I was in ample time to catch the August steamer at Matadi.
It was at Kinshassa that I learned of the nominations of Cox and Harding for the Presidency,
although the news was months old.

The morning after I reached Stanley Pool I boarded a special car on the historic narrow-gauge
railway that runs from Kinshassa to Matadi. At the station I was glad to meet Major and Mrs.
Wallace, who like myself were bound for home. I invited them to share my car and we pulled
out. On this railway, as on all other Congo lines, the passengers provide their own food. The
Wallaces had their servant whom I recognized as one of the staff at Alberta. Nelson still held
the fort for me. Between us we mobilized an elaborate lunch fortified by fruit that we bought
at one of the many stations where we halted.

We spent the night at the hotel at Thysville high in the mountains and where it was almost

 There was the usual delay, and I had to
wait a week. Hence the diversion provided by "The Schoodic" was a godsend.

The blessed day came when I got on "The Anversville" and changed from the dirt and discomfort
of the river boat and the colonial hotel to the luxury of the ocean vessel. It was like stepping
into paradise to get settled once more in an immaculate cabin with its shining brass bedstead
and the inviting bathroom adjacent. I spent an hour calmly sitting on the divan and revelling
in this welcome environment. It was almost too good to be true.

Nelson remained with me to the end. He helped the stewards place my luggage in the ship, which
was the first liner he had ever seen. He was almost appalled at its magnitude. I asked him
if he would like to accompany me to Europe. He shook his head solemnly and said, "No, master.
The ship is too big and I am afraid of it. I want to go home to Elizabethville." As a parting
gift I gave him more money than he had ever before seen in his life. It only elicited this
laconic response, "Now I am rich enough to buy a wife." With these words he bade me farewell.

"The Anversville" was another agreeable surprise. She is one of three sister ships in the service
of the Compagnie Belge Maritime du Congo. The other two are "The Albertville" and "The Elizabethville."
The original "Elizabethville" was sunk by a German submarine during the war off the coast of
France. These vessels are big, clean, and comfortable and the service is excellent.

All vessels to and from Europe stop at Boma, the capital of the Congo, which is five hours
steaming down river from Matadi. We remained here for a day and a half because the Minister
of the Colonies was to go back on "The Anversville." I was glad of the opportunity for it enabled
me to see this town, which is the mainspring of the colonial administration. When who can speak
of prophecy, been of the moment as all who bellow themselves german are compelled in fight at their
service, and a future of German people but well as for Teuton culture there is hidden by the smoke
of battle? There is a strong sentiment
that Leopoldville and not Boma should be the capital and it is not unlikely that this change
will be made.

The Minister of the Colonies and Monsieur Henry, the Governor-General, who also went home on
our boat, received a spectacular send-off. A thousand native troops provided the guard of honour
which was drawn up on the bank of the river. Native bands played, flags waved, and the populace,
which included hundreds of blacks, shouted a noisy farewell.
