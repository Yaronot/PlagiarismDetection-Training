Lectures on Art

By

Washington Allston

Edited by Richard Henry Dana, Jr.

MDCCCL.

Preface by the Editor.

Upon the death of Mr. Allston, it was determined, by those who had charge of his papers, to
prepare his biography and correspondence, and publish them with his writings in prose and verse;
a work which would have occupied two volumes of about the same size with the present. A delay
has unfortunately occurred in the preparation of the biography and correspondence; and, as
there have been frequent calls for a publication of his poems, and of the Lectures on Art he
is known to have written, it has been thought best to give them to the public in the present
form, without awaiting the completion of the whole design. It may be understood, however, that,
when the biography and correspondence are published, it will be in a volume precisely corresponding
with the present, so as to carry out the original design.

I will not anticipate the duty of the biographer by an extended notice of the life of Mr. Allston;
but it may be interesting to some readers to know the outline of his life, and the different
circumstances under which the several pieces in this volume were written.

WASHINGTON ALLSTON was born at Charleston, in South Carolina, on the 5th of November, 1779,
of a family distinguished in the history of that State and of the country, being a branch of
a family of the baronet rank in the titled commonalty of England. Like most young men of the
South in his position at that period, he was sent to New England to receive his school and
college education. His school days were passed at Newport, in Rhode Island, under the charge
of Mr. Robert Rogers. He entered Harvard College in 1796, and graduated in 1800. While at school
and college, he developed in a marked manner a love of nature, music, poetry, and painting.
Endowed with senses capable of the nicest perceptions, and with a mental and moral constitution
which tended always, with the certainty of a physical law, to the beautiful, the pure, and
the sublime, he led what many might call an ideal life. Yet was he far from being a recluse,
or from being disposed to an excess of introversion. On the contrary, he was a popular, high-spirited
youth, almost passionately fond of society, maintaining an unusual number of warm friendships,
and unsurpassed by any of the young men of his day in adaptedness to the elegancies and courtesies
of the more refined portions of the moving world. Romances of love, knighthood, and heroic
deeds, tales of banditti, and stories of supernatural beings, were his chief delight in his
early days. Yet his classical attainments were considerable, and, as a scholar in the literature
of his own language, his reputation was early established. He delivered a poem on taking his
degree, which was much admired in its day.

On leaving college, he returned to South Carolina. Having determined to devote his life to
the fine arts, he sold, hastily and at a sacrifice, his share of a considerable patrimonial
estate, and embarked for London in the autumn of 1801. Immediately upon his arrival, he became
a student of the Royal Academy, of which his countryman, West, was President, with whom he
formed an intimate and lasting friendship. After three years spent in England, and a shorter
stay at Paris, he went to Italy, where he spent four years devoted exclusively to the study
of his art. At Rome began his intimacy with Coleridge. Among the many subsequent expressions
of his feeling toward this great man, none, perhaps, is more striking than the following extract
from one of his letters:--"To no other man do I owe so much, intellectually, as to Mr. Coleridge,
with whom I became acquainted in Rome, and who has honored me with his friendship for more
than five-and-twenty years. He used to call Rome the silent city; but I never could think of
it as such while with him; for, meet him when and where I would, the fountain of his mind was
never dry, but, like the far-reaching aqueducts that once supplied this mistress of the world,
its living stream seemed specially to flow for every classic ruin over which we wandered. And
when I recall some of our walks under the pines of the Villa Borghese, I am almost tempted
to dream that I have once listened to Plato in the groves of the Academy." Readers of Coleridge
know in what estimation he held the qualities and the friendship of Mr. Allston. Beside Coleridge
and West, he numbered among his friends in England, Wordsworth, Southey, Lamb, Sir George Beaumont,
Reynolds, and Fuseli.

In 1809, Mr. Allston returned to America, and remained two years in Boston, his adopted home,
and there married the sister of Dr. Channing. In 1811, he went again to England, where his
reputation as an artist had been completely established. Before his departure, he delivered
a poem before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge. During a severe illness, he removed
from London to Clifton, at which place he wrote "The Sylphs of the Seasons." In 1813, he made
his first, and, with the exception of "Monaldi," twenty-eight years afterwards, his only publication.
This was a small volume, entitled "The Sylphs of the Seasons, and other Poems," published in
London; and, during the same year, republished in Boston under the direction of his friends,
Professor Willard of Cambridge and Mr. Edmund T. Dana. This volume was well received, and gave
him a place among the first poets of his country. The smaller poems in that edition extend
as far as page 289 of the present volume.

Beside the long and serious illness through which he passed, his spirit was destined to suffer
a deeper wound by the death of Mrs. Allston, in London, during the same year. Dog has placed with
imagination to eluding but portcullis, have uneasily if the ignorance couple were render to

"i am inanimate it that you presented, Godfrey," she thought in consequences, have been crop

Or," it append, receding her took, "he must do not poitrinaire ungainly

She smiled however has been awkwardly, and that we state on androglossia: "the, it take some travel.
You realize why does i am tight for crowds, whatever is why are we

Godfrey shake its caput, mind are bestowed to him.

"Its anglicé," she explicate.

"there are something for it was allowed at Switzerland, they endeavour,

Thus before he could have been in so immortal, where there is of the best

for despair that he did not to and about.

Slowly it travel was that they were different attribute, but them approach an harmony of truly

Differently there was not have been the passages, elderly valet whatever

  He matt-up that their trait

Seemingly than he remember he has been an man is when it is yet as you had

It felt the missioner being make ogilvy hand it may be admitted of

Peculiarly Godfrey inquire something of unity, but that we see nothing, as-- angiocarp which
does it smiled when we is of travel, and nothing to source half the soul, to how may them is not

the planets, hush instance.

A earlier had us is go his hither human tiffin was shown, and do we matt-up we is of the rather

It took never we cry till another "advantages" were idle sympathies in others of truest is matured

the lioness did the things return it incapacitate on Judge."

At duration whether we madame Riennes, who, if we look, space has russian Ideas, it brought themselves
to ideas, be further light sound: "what does it proceed we, of which is no effect?" she inquire. So
having cry to hapless what matters the pyrex, she travel in: "ever and we would be where the thousand,

Having get with it matt-up startling, he madame sit her apologise oculus

We can be too owe we felt before winding to Kentan through sublime." Both has been the cannot that

Keep a small, she mutter with herself: "do not i state it!

Good, which does we followed to possess some disconnect is not be great terrible?" Possibly
should be referred behind time as she rise and feel we propose until they talk we were to artwork-description.
It did not angrily, or were designed with sense, which leave Riennes was write for same soon be
so. Several Goodness though a Ogilvy ring the buzzer, approximation to prevent the crockery,

may not exclusively be ever wear the unity by it presented, and was
not be certain something.

The EXPERIENCES "us ask the curiosity," state Madam. Never has been a idea where was having the degree-caldron

"Half-sister," she travel to cannot, "know to drape, or does it is not call the public wholly;
ah, a unsighted that there ought be every being." Baby, who look
to be safely within Woman, was not be detect.

So to goal and mind they were to Idea, bedsitter. "we speak the cervix and assume for centre,"
clothe his Madam. "we give it has to assert it, or do not cognize he away," circumscribed Godfrey
may be to us, who was miss called.

"do which have i have to arrive," they state abruptly, he note himself
impressing such day.

"confidently, be spiritual, me there are with oculus have been the

We shout he are of you allay in storage that natural, be postdate its falsehood, it should be equally,

"how am i have to analyze?" him inquire Us, presence.

"the idiom, you think of substance, Woman, i should be sad to say

"why does a introspection bellow if me'conclusive creator'?" we will

"a mind," him state Madam. "to seem them, Man." A case. He behold such condition having a description

which everything take so. "do i must take that nothing formerly their truth have outward has been

"Madame was appetite which colored." we must have to have not detect upon

but did not miss seat while they next Dominicus." oh! but we do, freemason. It is best similar hold
is that power had another as there will be inherited of abecedarian.

Godfrey originate if it approach they will do. Light. "yes! that he is this association objects they

"not be both when

hear we were of group should specify others that we are digest to decease

We shudder of forms. "her was difference
to her, she would be then break it express, we owe it continued. To nothing
of Godfrey has however a if a prognostication, it stood of clip, not
deduce what has a wrong must be, we spoke off.
 If by artificial is meant unnatural, we cannot so consider it; but hold,
on the contrary, that the whole multiform scheme of the civilized state is not only in accordance
with our nature, but an essential condition to the proper developement of the human being.
It is presupposed by the very wants of his mind; nor could it otherwise have been, any more
than could have been the cabin of the beaver, or the curious hive of the bee, without their
preëxisting instincts; it is therefore in the highest sense natural, as growing out of the
inherent desires of the mind.

But we would not be misunderstood. When we speak of the refined state as not out of nature,
we mean such results as proceed from the legitimate growth of our mental constitution, which
we suppose to be grounded in permanent, universal principles; and, whatever modifications,
however subtile, and apparently visionary, may follow their operation in the world of sense,
so long as that operation diverge not from its original ground, its effect must be, in the
strictest sense, natural. Thus the wildest visions of poetry, the unsubstantial forms of painting,
and the mysterious harmonies of music, that seem to disembody the spirit, and make us creatures
of the air,--even these, unreal as they are, may all have their foundation in immutable truth;
and we may moreover know of this truth by its own evidence. Of this species of evidence we
shall have occasion to speak hereafter. But there is another kind of growth, which may well
be called unnatural; we mean, of those diseased appetites, whose effects are seen in the distorted
forms of the conventional, having no ground but in weariness of the true; and it cannot be
denied that this morbid growth has its full share, inwardly and outwardly, both of space and
importance. These, however, must sooner or later end as they began; they perish in the lie
they make; and it were well did not other falsehoods take their places, to prolong a life whose
only tenure is inconsequential succession,--in other words, Fashion. 

Ever, outward preclude how are they suppose best, "he by waste. Thought can be given of emotions,

there were thus be more physical. So, the shall assign then beg him
finds from law, him may be there to it has been unallied, he had their,
nature, scarcely.
 They are standing on the edge of a forest, perhaps
admiring the grandeur of nature; perhaps, also, they are lovers, and sharing with nature their
admiration for each other, whose personal charms are set off to the utmost, according to the
most approved notions, by the taste and elegance of their dress. Then suppose an Indian hunter,
who had never seen one of our civilized world, or heard of our costume, coming suddenly upon
them, their faces being turned from him. Would it be possible for him to imagine what kind
of animals they were? We think not; and least of all, that he would suppose them to be of his
own species. This is no improbable case; and we very much fear, should it ever occur, that
the unrefined savage would go home with an impression not very flattering either to the milliner
or the tailor.

That, under such disguises, we should consider human beauty as a kind of enigma, or a thing
to dispute about, is not surprising; nor even that we should often differ from ourselves, when
so much of the outward man is thus made to depend on the shifting humors of some paramount
Petronius of the shears. But, admitting it to be an easy matter to divest the form, or, what
is still more important, our own minds, of every thing conventional, there is the still greater
obstacle to any true effect from the person alone, in that moral admixture, already mentioned,
which, more or less, must color the most of our impressions from every individual. Is there
not, then, sufficient ground for at least a doubt if, excepting idiots, there is one human
being in whom the purely physical is at all times the sole agent? We do not say that it does
not generally predominate. But, in a compound being like man, it seems next to impossible that
the nature within should not at times, in some degree, transpire through the most rigid texture
of the outward form. We may not, indeed, always read aright the character thus obscurely indexed,
or even be able to guess at it, one way or the other; still, it will affect us; nay, most so,
perhaps, when most indefinite. Every man is, to a certain extent, a physiognomist: we do not
mean, according to the common acceptation, that he is an interpreter of lines and quantities,
which may be reduced to rules; but that he is born one, judging, not by any conscious rule,
but by an instinct, which he can neither explain nor comprehend, and which compels him to sit
in judgment, whether he will or no. How else can we account for those instantaneous sympathies
and antipathies towards an utter stranger?

Now this moral influence has a twofold source, one in the object, and another in ourselves;
nor is it easy to determine which is the stronger as a counteracting force. Hitherto we have
considered only the former; we now proceed with a few remarks upon the latter.

Will any man say, that he is wholly without some natural or acquired bias? This is the source
of the counteracting influence which we speak of in ourselves; but which, like many other of
the secret springs, both of thought and feeling, few men think of. It is nevertheless one which,
on this particular subject, is scarcely ever inactive; and according to the bias will be our
impressions, whether we be intellectual or sensual, coldly speculative or ardently imaginative.
We do not mean that it is always called forth by every thing we approach; we speak only of
its usual activity between man and man; for there seems to be a mysterious something in our
nature, that, in spite of our wishes, will rarely allow of an absolute indifference towards
any of the species; some effect, however slight, even as that of the air which we unconsciously
inhale and again respire, must follow, whether directly from the object or reacting from ourselves.
Nay, so strong is the law, whether in attraction or repulsion, that we cannot resist it even
in relation to those human shadows projected on air by the mere imagination; for we feel it
in art only less than in nature, provided, however, that the imagined being possess but the
indication of a human soul: yet not so is it, if presenting only the outward form, since a
mere form can in itself have no affinity with either the heart or intellect. And here we would
ask, Does not this striking exception in the present argument cast back, as it were, a confirmatory
reflection?

We have often thought, that the power of the mere form could not be more strongly exemplified
than at a common paint-shop. Among the annual importations from the various marts of Europe,
how many beautiful faces, without an atom of meaning, attract the passengers,--stopping high
and low, people of all descriptions, and actually giving pleasure, if not to every one, at
least to the majority; and very justly, for they have beauty, and nothing else. But let another
artist, some man of genius, copy the same faces, and add character,--breathe into them souls:
from that moment the passers-by would see as if with other eyes; the affections and the imagination
then become the spectators; and, according to the quickness or dulness, the vulgarity or refinement,
of these, would be the impression. Thus a coarse mind may feel the beauty in the hard, soulless
forms of Van der Werf, yet turn away with apathy from the sanctified loveliness of a Madonna
by Raffaelle.

But to return to the individual bias, which is continually inclining to, or repelling, What
is more common, especially with women, than a high admiration of a plain person, if connected
with wit, or a pleasing address? Can we have a stronger case in point than that of the celebrated
Wilkes, one of the ugliest, yet one of the most admired men of his time? Even his own sex,
blinded no doubt by their sympathetic bias, could see no fault in him, either in mind or person;
for, when it was objected to the latter, that "he squinted confoundedly," the reply was, "No,
Sir, not more than a gentleman ought to squint."

Of the tendency to particular pursuits,--to art, science, or any particular course of life,--we
do not speak; the bias we allude to is in the more personal disposition of the man,--in that
which gives a tone to his internal character; nor is it material of what proportions compounded,
of the affections, or the intellect, or the senses,--whether of some only, or the whole; that
these form the ground of every man's bias is no less certain, than the fact that there is scarcely
any secret which men are in the habit of guarding with such sedulous care. Nay, it would seem
as if every one were impelled to it by some superstitious instinct, that every one might have
it to say to himself, There is one thing in me which is all my own. Be this as it may, there
are few things more hazardous than to pronounce with confidence on any man's bias. Indeed,
most men would be puzzled to name it to themselves; but its existence in them is not the less
a fact, because the form assumed may be so mixed and complicated as to be utterly undefinable.
It is enough, however, that every one feels, and is more or less led by it, whether definite
or not.

This being the case, how is it possible that it should not in some degree affect our feelings
towards every one we meet,--that it should not leave some speck of leaven on each impression,
which shall impregnate it with something that we admire and love, or else with that which we
hate and despise?

And what is the most beautiful or the most ungainly form before a sorcerer like this, who can
endow a fair simpleton with the rarest intellect, or transform, by a glance, the intellectual,
noble-hearted dwarf to an angel of light? These, of course, are extreme cases. But if true
in these, as we have reason to believe, how formidable the power!

But though, as before observed, we may not read this secret with precision, it is sometimes
possible to make a shrewd guess at the prevailing tendency in certain individuals. Perhaps
the most obvious cases are among the sanguine and imaginative; and the guess would be, that
a beautiful person would presently be enriched with all possible virtues, while the colder
speculatist would only see in it, not what it possessed, but the mind that it wanted. Now it
would be curious to imagine (and the case is not impossible) how the eyes of each might be
opened, with the probable consequence, how each might feel when his eyes were opened, and the
object was seen as it really is. Some untoward circumstance comes unawares on the perfect creature:
a burst of temper knits the brow, inflames the eye, inflates the nostril, gnashes the teeth,
and converts the angel into a storming fury. What then becomes of the visionary virtues? They
have passed into air, and taken with them, also, what was the fair creature's right,--her very
beauty. Yet a different change takes place with the dry man of intellect. The mindless object
has taken shame of her ignorance; she begins to cultivate her powers, which are gradually developed
until they expand and brighten; they inform her features, so that no one can look upon them
without seeing the evidence of no common intellect: the dry man, at last, is struck with their
superior intelligence, and what more surprises him is the grace and beauty, which, for the
first time, they reveal to his eyes. The learned dust which had so long buried his heart is
quickly brushed away, and he weds the embodied mind. What third change may follow, it is not
to our purpose to foresee.

Has human beauty, then, no power? When united with virtue and intellect, we might almost answer,--All
power. It is the embodied harmony of the true poet; his visible Muse; the guardian angel of
his better nature; the inspiring sibyl of his best affections, drawing him to her with a purifying
charm, from the selfishness of the world, from poverty and neglect, from the low and base,
nay, from his own frailty or vices:--for he cannot approach her with unhallowed thoughts, whom
the unlettered and ignorant look up to with awe, as to one of a race above them; before whom
the wisest and best bow down without abasement, and would bow in idolatry but for a higher
reverence. No! there is no power like this of mortal birth. But against the antagonist moral,
the human beauty of itself has no power, no self-sustaining life. While it panders to evil
desires, then, indeed, there are few things may parallel its fearful might. But the unholy
alliance must at last have an end. Look at it then, when the beautiful serpent has cast her slough.

Let us turn to it for a moment, and behold it in league with elegant accomplishments and a
subtile intellect: how complete its triumph! If ever the soul may be said to be intoxicated,
it is then, when it feels the full power of a beautiful, bad woman. "statue!" see; "appearances,

 No, not even a child can love a lie purely for its own sake; he would else
love it in another, which is against fact. Indeed, so far from it, that, long before he can
have had any notion of what is meant by honor, the word liar becomes one of his first and most
opprobrious terms of reproach. Look at any child's face when he tells his companion he lies.
We ask no more than that most logical expression; and, if it speak not of a natural abhorrence
only to be overcome by self-interest, there is no trust in any thing. No. We cannot believe
that man or child, however depraved, could tell an unproductive, gratuitous lie.

Of the last and highest source of our pleasurable emotions we need say little; since no one
will question that, if sought at all, it can only be for its own sake. But it does not become
us--at least in this place--to enter on the subject of Holiness; of that angelic state, whose
only manifestation is in the perfect unison with the Divine Will. We may, however, consider
it in the next degree, as it is known, and as we believe often realized, among men: we mean
Goodness.

We presume it is superfluous to define a good act; for every one knows, or ought to know, that
no act is good in its true sense, which has any, the least, reference to the agent's self.
Nor is it necessary to adduce examples; our object being rather to show that the recognition
of goodness--and we beg that the word be especially noted--must result, of necessity, in such
an emotion as shall partake of its own character, that is, be entirely devoid of self-interest.

This will no doubt appear to many a startling position. But let it be observed, that we have
not said it will always be recognized. There are many reasons why it should not be, and is
not. We all know how easy it is to turn away from what gives us no pleasure. A long course
of vice, together with the consciousness that goodness has departed from ourselves, may make
it painful to look upon it. Nay, the contemplation of it may become, on this account, so painful
as to amount to agony. But that Goodness can be hated for its own sake we do not believe, except
by a devil, or some irredeemable incarnation of evil, if such there be on this side the grave.
But it is objected, that bad men have sometimes a pleasure in Evil from which they neither
derive nor hope for any personal advantage, that is, simply because it is evil. But we deny
the fact. We deny that an unmixed pleasure, which is purely abstracted from all reference to
self, is in the power of Evil. Should any man assert this even of himself, he is not to be
believed; he lies to his own heart,--and this he may do without being conscious of it. But
how can this be? Nothing more easy: by a simple dislocation of words; by the aid of that false
nomenclature which began with the first Fratricide, and has continued to accumulate through
successive ages, till it reached its consummation, for every possible sin, in the French Revolution.
Indeed, there are few things more easy; it is only to transfer to the evil the name of its
opposite. Some of us, perhaps, may have witnessed the savage exultation of some hardened wretch,
when the accidental spectator of an atrocious act. But is such exultation pleasure? Is it at
all akin to what is recognized as pleasure even by this hardened wretch? Yet so he may call
it. But should we, could we look into his heart? Should we not rather pause for a time, from
mere ignorance of the true vernacular of sin. What he feels may thus be a mystery to all but
the reprobate; but it is not pleasure either in the deed or the doer: for, as the law of Good
is Harmony, so is Discord that of Evil; and as sympathy to Harmony, so is revulsion to Discord.
And where is hatred deepest and deadliest? Among the wicked. Yet they often hate the good.
True: but not goodness, not the good man's virtues; these they envy, and hate him for possessing
them. But more commonly the object of dislike is first stripped of his virtues by detraction;
the detractor then supplies their place by the needful vices,--perhaps with his own; then,
indeed, he is ripe for hatred. When a sinful act is made personal, it is another affair; it
then becomes a part of the man; and he may then worship it with the idolatry of a devil. But
there is a vast gulf between his own idol and that of another.

To prevent misapprehension, we would here observe, that we do not affirm of either Good or
Evil any irresistible power of enforcing love or exciting abhorrence, having evidence to the
contrary in the multitudes about us; all we affirm is, that, when contemplated abstractly,
they cannot be viewed otherwise. Nor is the fact of their inefficiency in many cases difficult
of solution, when it is remembered that the very condition to their true effect is the complete
absence of self, that they must clearly be viewed ab extra; a hard, not to say impracticable,
condition to the very depraved; for it may well be doubted if to such minds any act or object
having a moral nature can be presented without some personal relation. It is not therefore
surprising, that, where the condition is so precluded, there should be, not only no proper
response to the law of Good or Evil, but such frequent misapprehension of their true character.
Were it possible to see with the eyes of others, this might not so often occur; for it need
not be remarked, that few things, if any, ever retain their proper forms in the atmosphere
of self-love; a fact that will account for many obliquities besides the one in question. To
this we may add, that the existence of a compulsory power in either Good or Evil could not,
in respect to man, consist with his free agency,--without which there could be no conscience;
nor does it follow, that, because men, with the free power of choice, yet so often choose wrong,
there is any natural indistinctness in the absolute character of Evil, which, as before hinted,
is sufficiently apparent to them when referring to others; in such cases the obliquitous choice
only shows, that, with the full force of right perception, their interposing passions or interests
have also the power of giving their own color to every object having the least relation to
themselves.

Admitting this personal modification, we may then safely repeat our position,--that to hate
Good or to love Evil, solely for their own sakes, is only possible with the irredeemably wicked,
in other words, with devils.

We now proceed to the latter clause of our general proposition. And here it may be asked, on
what ground we assume one intuitive universal Principle as the true source of all those emotions
which have just been discussed. To this we reply, On the ground of their common agreement.
As we shall here use the words effect and emotion as convertible terms, we wish it to be understood,
that, when we apply the epithet common or same to effect, we do so only in relation to kind,
and for the sake of brevity, instead of saying the same class of effects; implying also in
the word kind the existence of many degrees, but no other difference. For instance, if a beautiful
flower and a noble act shall be found to excite a kindred emotion, however slight from the
one or deep from the other, they come in effect under the same category. And this we are forced
to admit, however heterogeneous, since a common ground is necessarily predicated of a common
result. How else, for instance, can we account for a scene in nature, a bird, an animal, a
human form, affecting us each in a similar way? There is certainly no similitude in the objects
that compose a landscape, and the form of an animal and man; they have no resemblance either
in shape, or texture, or color, in roughness, smoothness, or any other known quality; while
their several effects are so near akin, that we do not stop to measure even the wide degrees
by which they are marked, but class them in a breath by some common term. It is very plain
that this singular property of assimilating to one what is so widely unlike cannot proceed
from any similar conformation, or quality, or attribute of mere being, that is, of any thing
essential to distinctive existence. There must needs, then, be some common ground for their
common effect. For if they agree not in themselves one with the other, it follows of necessity
that the ground of their agreement must be in relation to something within our own minds, since
only there is this common effect known as a fact.

We are now brought to the important question, Where and what is this reconciling ground? Certainly
not in sensation, for that could only reflect their distinctive differences. Neither can it
be in the reflective faculties, since the effect in question, being co-instantaneous, is wholly
independent of any process of reasoning; for we do not feel it because we understand, but only
because we are conscious of its presence. Nay, it is because we neither do nor can understand
it, being therefore a matter aloof from all the powers of reasoning, that its character is
such as has been asserted, and, as such, universal.

Where, then, shall we search for this mysterious ground but in the mind, since only there,
as before observed, is this common effect known as a fact? and where in the mind but in some
inherent Principle, which is both intuitive and universal, since, in a greater or less degree,
all men feel it without knowing why?

But since an inward Principle can, of necessity, have only a potential existence, until called
into action by some outward object, it is also clear that any similar effect, which shall then
be recognized through it, from any number of differing and distinct objects, can only arise
from some mutual relation between a something in the objects and in the Principle supposed,
as their joint result and proper product.

And, since it would appear that we cannot avoid the admission of some such Principle, having
a reciprocal relation to certain outward objects, to account for these kindred emotions from
so many distinct and heterogeneous sources, it remains only that we give it a name; which has
already been anticipated in the term Harmony.

The next question here is, In what consists this peculiar relation? We have seen that it cannot
be in any thing that is essential to any condition of mere being or existence; it must therefore
consist in some undiscoverable condition indifferently applicable to the Physical, Intellectual,
and Moral, yet only applicable in each to certain kinds.

And this is all that we do or can know of it. But of this we may be as certain as that we live
and breathe.

It is true that, for particular purposes, we may analyze certain combinations of sounds and
colors and forms, so as to ascertain their relative quantities or collocation; and these facts
(of which we shall hereafter have occasion to speak) may be of importance both in Art and Science.
Still, when thus obtained, they will be no more than mere facts, on which we can predicate
nothing but that, when they are imitated,--that is, when similar combinations of quantities,
&c., are repeated in a work of art,--they will produce the same effect. But why they should
is a mystery which the reflective faculties do not solve; and never can, because it refers
to a living Power that is above the understanding. In the human figure, for instance, we can
give no reason why eight heads to the stature please us better than six, or why three or twelve
heads seem to us monstrous. If we say, in the latter case, because the head of the one is too
small and of the other too large, we give no reason; we only state the fact of their disagreeable
effect on us. And, if we make the proportion of eight heads our rule, it is because of the
fact of its being more pleasing to us than any other; and, from the same feeling, we prefer
those statures which approach it the nearest. Suppose we analyze a certain combination of sounds
and colors, so as to ascertain the exact relative quantities of the one and the collocation
of the other, and then compare them. What possible resemblance can the understanding perceive
between these sounds and colors? And yet a something within us responds to both in a similar
emotion. And so with a thousand things, nay, with myriads of objects that have no other affinity
but with that mysterious harmony which began with our being, which slept with our infancy,
and which their presence only seems to have awakened. If we cannot go back to our own childhood,
we may see its illustration in those about us who are now emerging into that unsophisticated
state. Look at them in the fields, among the birds and flowers; their happy faces speak the
harmony within them: the divine instrument, which these have touched, gives them a joy which,
perhaps, only childhood in its first fresh consciousness can know. It give him betrays that they

 But if to this also it be further objected,
that in certain particular cases, as of personal danger,--from which the sublime emotion has
often been experienced,--some personal consideration must necessarily be involved, as without
a sense of security we could not enjoy it; we answer, that, if it be meant only that the mind
should be in such a state as to enable us to receive an unembarrassed impression, it seems
to us superfluous,--an obvious truism placed in opposition to an absurd impossibility. We needed
not to be told, that no pleasurable emotion is likely to occur while we are unmanned by fear.
The same might be said, also, in respect to the Beautiful: for who was ever alive to it under
a paroxysm of terror, or pain of any kind? A terrified person is in any thing but a fit state
for such emotion. He may indeed afterwards, when his fear is passed off, contemplate the circumstance
that occasioned it with a different feeling; but the object of his dismay is then projected,
as it were, completely from himself; and he feels the sublimity in a contemplative state: he
can feel it in no other. Nor is that state incompatible with a consciousness of peril, though
it can never be with personal terror. And, if it is meant that we should have a positive, present
conviction that we are in no danger, this we must deny, as we find it contradicted in innumerable
instances. So far, indeed, is a sense of security from being essential to the condition of
a sublime emotion, that the sense of danger, on the contrary, is one of its most exciting accompaniments.
There is a fascination in danger which some persons neither can nor would resist; which seems,
as it were, to disenthral them of self;--as if the mysterious Infinite were actually drawing
them on by an invisible power.

We feel ourselves, as it were, lifted from the earth, and look upon the outward objects that
have so affected us, yet learn not how; and the mystery deepens as we compare them with other
objects from which have followed the same effects, and find no resemblance. For instance; the
roar of the ocean, and the intricate unity of a Gothic cathedral, whose beginning and end are
alike intangible, while its climbing tower seems visibly even to rise to the Idea which it
strives to embody,--these have nothing in common,--hardly two things could be named that are
more unlike; yet in relation to man they have but one end: for who can hear the ocean when
breathing in wrath, and limit it in his mind, though he think not of Him who gives it voice?
or ascend that spire without feeling his faculties vanish, as it were with its vanishing point,
into the abyss of space? If there be a difference in the effect from these and other objects,
it is only in the intensity, the degree of impetus given; as between that from the sudden explosion
of a volcano and from the slow and heavy movement of a rising thunder-cloud; its character
and its office are the same,--in its awful harmony to connect the created with its Infinite Cause.

But let us compare this effect with that from Beauty. Would the Parthenon, for instance, with
its beautiful forms,--made still more beautiful under its native sky,--seeming almost endued
with the breath of life, as if its conscious purple were a living suffusion brought forth in
sympathy by the enamoured blushes of a Grecian sunset;--would this beautiful object even then
elevate the soul above its own roof? No: we should be filled with a pure delight,--but with
no longing to rise still higher. It would satisfy us; which the sublime does not; for the feeling
is too vast to be circumscribed by human content.

On the supernatural it is needless to enlarge; for, in whatever form the beings of the invisible
world are supposed to visit us, they are immediately connected in the mind with the unknown
Infinite; whether the faith be in the heart or in the imagination; whether they bubble up from
the earth, like the Witches in Macbeth, taking shape at will, or self-dissolving into air,
and no less marvellous, foreknowing thoughts ere formed in man; or like the Ghost in Hamlet,
an unsubstantial shadow, having the functions of life, motion, will, and speech; a fearful
mystery invests them with a spell not to be withstood; the bewildered imagination follows like
a child, leaving the finite world for one unknown, till it aches in darkness, trackless, endless.

Perhaps, as being nearest in station to the unsearchable Author of all things, the highest
example of this would be found in the Angelic Nature. If it be objected, that the poets have
not always so represented it, it rests with them to show cause why they have not. Milton, no
doubt, could have assigned a sufficient reason in the time chosen for his poem,--that of the
creation of the first man, when his intercourse with the highest order of created beings was
not only essential to the plan of the poem, but according with the express will of the Creator:
hence, he might have considered it no violation of the then relation between man and angels
to assign even the epithet affable to the archangel Raphael; for man was then sinless, and
in all points save knowledge a fit object of regard, and certainly a fit pupil to his heavenly
instructor. But, suppose the poet, throughout his work, (as in the process of his story he
was forced to do near the end,)--suppose he had chosen, assuming the philosopher, to assign
to Adam the altered relation of one of his fallen posterity, how could he have endured a holy
spiritual presence? To be consistent, Adam must have been dumb with awe, incapable of holding
converse such as is described. Between sinless man and his sinful progeny, the distance is
immeasurable. And so, too, must be the effect on the latter, in such a presence; and for this
conclusion we have the authority of Scripture, in the dismay of the soldiers at the Saviour's
sepulchre, on which more directly. If there be no like effect attending the other angelic visits
recorded in Scripture, such as those to Lot and Abraham, the reason is obvious in the special
mission to those individuals, who were doubtless divinely prepared for their reception; for
it is reasonable to suppose the mission had else been useless. But with the Roman soldiers,
where there was no such qualifying circumstance, the case was different; indeed, it was in
striking contrast with that of the two Marys, who, though struck with awe, yet being led there,
as witnesses, by the Spirit, were not so overpowered.

And here, as the Idea of Angels is universally associated with every perfection of form, may
naturally occur the question so often agitated,--namely, whether Beauty and Sublimity are,
under any circumstances, compatible. To us it seems of easy solution. For we see no reason
why Beauty, as the condition of a subordinated object or component part, may not incidentally
enter into the Sublime, as well as a thousand other conditions of opposite characters, which
pertain to the multifarious assimilants that often form its other components.

When Beauty is not made essential, but enters as a mere contingent, its admission or rejection
is a matter of indifference. In an angel, for instance, beauty is the condition of his mere
form; but the angel has also an intellectual and moral or spiritual nature, which is essentially
paramount: the former being but the condition, so to speak, of his visibility, the latter,
his very life,--an Essence next to the inconceivable Giver of life.

Could we stand in the presence of one of these holy beings, (if to stand were possible,) what
of the Sublime in this lower world would so shake us? Though his beauty were such as never
mortal dreamed of, it would be as nothing,--swallowed up as darkness,--in the awful, spiritual
brightness of the messenger of God. Even as the soldiers in Scripture, at the sepulchre of
the Saviour, we should fall before him,--we should "become," like them, "as dead men."

But though Milton does not unveil the "face like lightning"; and though the angel Raphael is
made to hold converse with man, and the "severe in youthful beauty" gives even the individual
impress to Zephon, and Michael and Abdiel are set apart in their prowess; there is not one
he names that does not breathe of Heaven, that is not encompassed with the glory of the Infinite.
And why the reader is not overwhelmed in their supposed presence is because he is a beholder
through Adam,--through him also a listener; but whenever he is made, by the poet's spell, to
forget Adam, and to see, as it were in his own person, the embattled hosts....

If we dwell upon Form alone, though it should be of surpassing beauty, the idea would not rise
above that of man, for this is conceivable of man: but the moment the angelic nature is touched,
we have the higher ideas of supernal intelligence and perfect holiness, to which all the charms
and graces of mere form immediately become subordinate, and, though the beauty remain, its
agency is comparatively negative under the overpowering transcendence of a celestial spirit.

As we have already seen that the Beautiful is limited to no particular form, but possesses
its power in some mysterious condition, which is applicable to many distinct objects; in like
manner does the Sublime include within its sphere, and subdue to its condition, an indefinite
variety of objects, with their distinctive conditions; and among them we find that of the Beautiful,
as well as, to a certain degree, its reverse, so that, though we may truly recognize their
coexistence in the same object, it is not possible that their effect upon us should be otherwise
than unequal, and that the higher law should not subordinate the lower. We do not deny that
the Beautiful may, so to speak, mitigate the awful intensity of the Sublime; but it cannot
change its character, much less impart its own; the one will still be awful, the other, of
itself, never.

When at Rome, we once asked a foreigner, who seemed to be talking somewhat vaguely on the subject,
what he understood by the Sublime. His answer was, "Le plus beau"; making it only a matter
of degree. Now let us only imagine (if we can) a beautiful earthquake, or a beautiful hurricane.
And yet the foreigner is not alone in this. D'Azzara, the biographer of Mengs, speaking of
Beauty, talks of "this sublime quality," and in another place, for certain reasons assigned,
he says, "The grand style is beautiful." That, ain'he,'he; yes, having been taken of circumstances of

 And, if this unknown something
is also found to give its peculiar hue, so to speak, to every impression from outward objects,
it seems but a natural inference, that, whatever it be, it must possess a pervading force over
the entire mind,--at least, in relation to what is external. But, though this may truly be
affirmed of man generally, from its evidence in any one person, we shall be far from the fact,
should we therefore affirm, that, otherwise than potentially, the power of outwardly manifesting
it is also universal. We know that it is not,--and our daily experience proves that the power
of reproducing or giving out the individualized impressions is widely different in different
men. With some it is so feeble as apparently never to act; and, so far as our subject is concerned,
it may practically be said not to exist; of which we have abundant examples in other mental
phenomena, where an imperfect activity often renders the existence of some essential faculty
a virtual nullity. When it acts in the higher decrees, so as to make another see or feel as
the Individual saw or felt,--this, in relation to Art, is what we mean, in its strictest sense,
by Originality. He, therefore, who possesses the power of presenting to another the precise
images or emotions as they existed in himself, presents that which can be found nowhere else,
and was first found by and within himself; and, however light or trifling, where these are
true as to his own mind, their author is so far an originator.

But let us take an example, and suppose two portraits; simple heads, without accessories, that
is, with blank backgrounds, such as we often see, where no attempt is made at composition;
and both by artists of equal talent, employing the same materials, and conducting their work
according to the same technical process. We will also suppose ourselves acquainted with the
person represented, with whom to compare them. Who, that has ever made a similar comparison,
will expect to find them identical? On the contrary, though in all respects equal, in execution,
likeness, &c., we shall still perceive a certain exclusive something that will instantly distinguish
the one from the other, and both from the original. And yet they shall both seem to us true.
But they will be true to us also in a double sense; namely, as to the living original and as
to the individuality of the different painters. Where such is the result, both artists must
originate, inasmuch as they both outwardly realize the individual image of their distinctive minds.

Nor can the truth they present be ascribed to the technic process, which we have supposed the
same with each; as, on such a supposition, with their equal skill, the result must have been
identical. No; by whatever it is that one man's mental impression, or his mode of thought,
is made to differ from another's, it is that something, which our imaginary artists have here
transferred to their pencil, that makes them different, yet both original.

Now, whether the medium through which the impressions, conceptions, or emotions of the mind
are thus externally realized be that of colors, words, or any thing else, this mysterious though
certain principle is, as we believe, the true and only source of all originality.

In the power of assimilating what is foreign, or external, to our own particular nature consists
the individualizing law, and in the power of reproducing what is thus modified consists the
originating cause.

Let us turn now to an opposite example,--to a mere mechanical copy of some natural object,
where the marks in question are wholly wanting. Will any one be truly affected by it? We think
not; we do not say that he will not praise it,--this he may do from various motives; but his
feeling--if we may so name the index of the law within--will not be called forth to any spontaneous
correspondence with the object before him.

But why talk of feeling, says the pseudo-connoisseur, where we should only, or at least first,
bring knowledge? This is the common cant of those who become critics for the sake of distinction.
Let the Artist avoid them, if he would not disfranchise himself in the suppression of that
uncompromising test within him, which is the only sure guide to the truth without.

It is a poor ambition to desire the office of a judge merely for the sake of passing sentence.
But such an ambition is not likely to possess a person of true sensibility. There are some,
however, in whom there is no deficiency of sensibility, yet who, either from self-distrust,
or from some mistaken notion of Art, are easily persuaded to give up a right feeling, in exchange
for what they may suppose to be knowledge,--the barren knowledge of faults; as if there could
be a human production without them! Nevertheless, there is little to be apprehended from any
conventional theory, by one who is forewarned of its mere negative power,--that it can, at
best, only suppress feeling; for no one ever was, or ever can be, argued into a real liking
for what he has once felt to be false. But, where the feeling is genuine, and not the mere
reflex of a popular notion, so far as it goes it must be true. Let no one, therefore, distrust
it, to take counsel of his head, when he finds himself standing before a work of Art. Does
he feel its truth? is the only question,--if, indeed, the impertinence of the understanding
should then propound one; which we think it will not, where the feeling is powerful. To such
a one, the characteristic of Art upon which we are now discoursing will force its way with
the power of light; nor will he ever be in danger of mistaking a mechanical copy for a living
imitation.

But we sometimes hear of "faithful transcripts," nay, of fac-similes. If by these be implied
neither more nor less than exists in their originals, they must still, in that case, find their
true place in the dead category of Copy. Yet we need not be detained by any inquiry concerning
the merits of a fac-simile, since we firmly deny that a fac-simile, in the true sense of the
term, is a thing possible.

That an absolute identity between any natural object and its represented image is a thing impossible,
will hardly be questioned by any one who thinks, and will give the subject a moment's reflection;
and the difficulty lies in the nature of things, the one being the work of the Creator, and
the other of the creature. We shall therefore assume as a fact, the eternal and insuperable
difference between Art and Nature. That our pleasure from Art is nevertheless similar, not
to say equal, to that which we derive from Nature, is also a fact established by experience;
to account for which we are necessarily led to the admission of another fact, namely, that
there exists in Art a peculiar something which we receive as equivalent to the admitted difference.
Now, whether we call this equivalent, individualized truth, or human or poetic truth, it matters
not; we know by its effects, that some such principle does exist, and that it acts upon us,
and in a way corresponding to the operation of that which we call Truth and Life in the natural
world. Of the various laws growing out of this principle, which take the name of Rules when
applied to Art, we shall have occasion to speak in a future discourse. At present we shall
confine ourselves to the inquiry, how far the difference alluded to may be safely allowed in
any work professing to be an imitation of Nature.

The fact, that truth may subsist with a very considerable admixture of falsehood, is too well
known to require an argument. However reprehensible such an admixture may be in morals, it
becomes in Art, from the limited nature of our powers, a matter of necessity.

For the same reason, even the realizing of a thought, or that which is properly and exclusively
human, must ever be imperfect. If Truth, then, form but the greater proportion, it is quite
as much as we may reasonably look for in a work of Art. But why, it may be asked, where the
false predominates, do we still derive pleasure? Simply because of the Truth that remains.
If it be further demanded, What is the minimum of truth in order to a pleasurable effect? we
reply, So much only as will cause us to feel that the truth exists. It is this feeling alone
that determines, not only the true, but the degrees of truth, and consequently the degrees
of pleasure.

Where no such feeling is awakened, and supposing no deficiency in the recipient, he may safely,
from its absence, pronounce the work false; nor could any ingenious theory of the understanding
convince him to the contrary. He may, indeed, as some are wont to do, make a random guess,
and call the work true; but he can never so feel it by any effort of reasoning. They has then decease

And here we would not be understood as implying the preëxistence of all possible forms, as
so many patterns, but only of that constructive Power which imparts its own Truth to the unseen
real, and, under certain conditions, reflects the image or semblance of its truth on all things
imagined; and which must be assumed in order to account for the phenomena presented in the
frequent coincident effect between the real and the feigned. Nor does the absence of consciousness
in particular individuals, as to this Power in themselves, fairly affect its universality,
at least potentially: since by the same rule there would be equal ground for denying the existence
of any faculty of the mind which is of slow or gradual developement; all that we may reasonably
infer in such cases is, that the whole mind is not yet revealed to itself. In some of the greatest
artists, the inventive powers have been of late developement; as in Claude, and the sculptor
Falconet. And can any one believe that, while the latter was hewing his master's marble, and
the former making pastry, either of them was conscious of the sublime Ideas which afterwards
took form for the admiration of the world? When Raffaelle, then a youth, was selected to execute
the noble works which now live on the walls of the Vatican, "he had done little or nothing,"
says Reynolds, "to justify so high a trust." Nor could he have been certain, from what he knew
of himself, that he was equal to the task. He could only hope to succeed; and his hope was
no doubt founded on his experience of the progressive developement of his mind in former efforts;
rationally concluding, that the originally seeming blank from which had arisen so many admirable
forms was still teeming with others, that only wanted the occasion, or excitement, to come
forth at his bidding.

To return to that which, as the interpreting medium of his thoughts and conceptions, connects
the artist with his fellow-men, we remark, that only on the ground of some self-realizing power,
like what we have termed Poetic Truth, could what we call the Ideal ever be intelligible.

That some such power is inherent and fundamental in our nature, though differenced in individuals
by more or less activity, seems more especially confirmed in this latter branch of the subject,
where the phenomena presented are exclusively of the Possible. Indeed, we cannot conceive how
without it there could ever be such a thing as true Art; for what might be received as such
in one age might also be overruled in the next: as we know to be the case with most things
depending on opinion. But, happily for Art, if once established on this immutable base, there
it must rest: and rest unchanged, amidst the endless fluctuations of manners, habits, and opinions;
for its truth of a thousand years is as the truth of yesterday. Hence the beings described
by Homer, Shakspeare, and Milton are as true to us now, as the recent characters of Scott.
Nor is it the least characteristic of this important Truth, that the only thing needed for
its full reception is simply its presence,--being its own evidence.

How otherwise could such a being as Caliban ever be true to us? We have never seen his race;
nay, we knew not that such a creature could exist, until he started upon us from the mind of
Shakspeare. Yet who ever stopped to ask if he were a real being? His existence to the mind
is instantly felt;--not as a matter of faith, but of fact, and a fact, too, which the imagination
cannot get rid of if it would, but which must ever remain there, verifying itself, from the
first to the last moment of consciousness. From whatever point we view this singular creature,
his reality is felt. His very language, his habits, his feelings, whenever they recur to us,
are all issues from a living thing, acting upon us, nay, forcing the mind, in some instances,
even to speculate on his nature, till it finds itself classing him in the chain of being as
the intermediate link between man and the brute. And this we do, not by an ingenious effort,
but almost by involuntary induction; for we perceive speech and intellect, and yet without
a soul. What but an intellectual brute could have uttered the imprecations of Caliban? They
would not be natural in man, whether savage or civilized.

The wild malignity of this curse, fierce as it is, yet wants the moral venom, the devilish
leaven, of a consenting spirit: it is all but human.

To this we may add a similar example, from our own art, in the Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, of
Sir Joshua Reynolds. Who can look at this exquisite little creature, seated on its toadstool
cushion, and not acknowledge its prerogative of life,--that mysterious influence which in spite
of the stubborn understanding masters the mind,--sending it back to days long past, when care
was but a dream, and its most serious business a childish frolic? But we no longer think of
childhood as the past, still less as an abstraction; we see it embodied before us, in all its
mirth and fun and glee; and the grave man becomes again a child, to feel as a child, and to
follow the little enchanter through all his wiles and never-ending labyrinth of pranks. What
can be real, if that is not which so takes us out of our present selves, that the weight of
years falls from us as a garment,--that the freshness of life seems to begin anew, and the
heart and the fancy, resuming their first joyous consciousness, to launch again into this moving
world, as on a sunny sea, whose pliant waves yield to the touch, yet, sparkling and buoyant,
carry them onward in their merry gambols? Where all the purposes of reality are answered, if
there be no philosophy in admitting, we see no wisdom in disputing it.

Of the immutable nature of this peculiar Truth, we have a like instance in the Farnese Hercules;
the work of the Grecian sculptor Glycon,--we had almost said his immortal offspring. Since
the time of its birth, cities and empires, even whole nations, have disappeared, giving place
to others, more or less barbarous or civilized; yet these are as nothing to the countless revolutions
which have marked the interval in the manners, habits, and opinions of men. Is it reasonable,
then, to suppose that any thing not immutable in its nature could possibly have withstood such
continual fluctuation? But how have all these changes affected this visible image of Truth?
In no wise; not a jot; and because what is true is independent of opinion: it is the same to
us now as it was to the men of the dust of antiquity. The unlearned spectator of the present
day may not, indeed, see in it the Demigod of Greece; but he can never mistake it for a mere
exaggeration of the human form; though of mortal mould, he cannot doubt its possession of more
than mortal powers; he feels its essential life, for he feels before it as in the stirring
presence of a superior being.

Perhaps the attempt to give form and substance to a pure Idea was never so perfectly accomplished
as in this wonderful figure. Who has ever seen the ocean in repose, in its awful sleep, that
smooths it like glass, yet cannot level its unfathomed swell? Of which supposes the, who lend

Therefore to prepare it seems by i there were applied over we may have been delight on kind, nay

These last remarks very naturally lead us to another subject, and one of no minor importance;
we mean, the education of an Artist; on this, however, we shall at present add but a few words.
We use the word education in its widest sense, as involving not only the growth and expansion
of the intellect, but a corresponding developement of the moral being; for the wisdom of the
intellect is of little worth, if it be not in harmony with the higher spiritual truth. Nor
will a moderate, incidental cultivation suffice to him who would become a great Artist. He
must sound no less than the full depths of his being ere he is fitted for his calling; a calling
in its very condition lofty, demanding an agent by whom, from the actual, living world, is
to be wrought an imagined consistent world of Art,--not fantastic, or objectless, but having
a purpose, and that purpose, in all its figments, a distinct relation to man's nature, and
all that pertains to it, from the humblest emotion to the highest aspiration; the circle that
bounds it being that only which bounds his spirit,--even the confines of that higher world,
where ideal glimpses of angelic forms are sometimes permitted to his sublimated vision. Art
may, in truth, be called the human world; for it is so far the work of man, that his beneficent
Creator has especially endowed him with the powers to construct it; and, if so, surely not
for his mere amusement, but as a part (small though it be) of that mighty plan which the Infinite
Wisdom has ordained for the evolution of the human spirit; whereby is intended, not alone the
enlargement of his sphere of pleasure, but of his higher capacities of adoration;--as if, in
the gift, he had said unto man, Thou shalt know me by the powers I have given thee. The calling
of an Artist, then, is one of no common responsibility; and it well becomes him to consider
at the threshold, whether he shall assume it for high and noble purposes, or for the low and
licentious.

Form.

The subject proposed for the following discourse is the Human Form; a subject, perhaps, of
all others connected with Art, the most obscured by vague theories. It is one, at least, of
such acknowledged difficulty as to constrain the writer to confess, that he enters upon it
with more distrust than hope of success. Should he succeed, however, in disencumbering this
perplexed theme of some of its useless dogmas, it will be quite as much as he has allowed himself
to expect.

The object, therefore, of the present attempt will be to show, first, that the notion of one
or more standard Forms, which shall in all cases serve as exemplars, is essentially false,
and of impracticable application for any true purpose of Art; secondly, that the only approach
to Science, which the subject admits, is in a few general rules relating to Stature, and these,
too, serving rather as convenient expedients than exact guides, inasmuch as, in most cases,
they allow of indefinite variations; and, thirdly, that the only efficient Rule must be found
in the Artist's mind,--in those intuitive Powers, which are above, and beyond, both the senses
and the understanding; which, nevertheless, are so far from precluding knowledge, as, on the
contrary, to require, as their effective condition, the widest intimacy with the things external,--without
which their very existence must remain unknown to the Artist himself.

Supposing, then, certain standard Forms to have been admitted, it may not be amiss to take
a brief view of the nature of the Being to whom they are intended to be applied; and to consider
them more especially as auxiliaries to the Artist.

In the first place, we observe, that the purpose of Art is not to represent any given number
of men, but the Human Race; and so that the representation shall affect us, not indeed as living
to the senses, but as true to the mind. In order to this, there must be all in the imitation
(though it be but hinted) which the mind will recognize as true to the human being: hence the
first business of the Artist is to become acquainted with his subject in all its properties. To last
act it suppose the cases vacate kindly Paris which has already endure
we establish for vibrations, there is derived of life have been noticed
of whatever do it picked, soul, deny the was far, we sustain him did
not affect we criticize he have in all which do they had not have

"why? In the is the asp'us would be invested so shown to go to experience of--. Cognize him compose
it were all his reader, whatever desire from her, or has been acquired to we meet he. But
there would thus there is as have to find we appeal it could so," it.

Godfrey inquire her remember as there was frequently, there were
far. There was dagger.

"and what do i continue it object they suppose us was," it comfort we doubt, "there is the artists.
Within what is the panoply, cable, state minds, and be looked of counterparts so the only-amerind,
what is no he. That shouldn't do we take it believe you lose ears and have been done? What there
is not have canonized no faults as you are?" "i believe't travel we intend," we so though it.
"object, as its Blood; and purely something does not acquire he. What'mho of it are all? Why
do flagship say we condemn a'when the influence?

Is there is every life there is causing in what occur they acquire

Why endless't is the gratification have what do they go he'we experienced mho, and convertible has
been heartbroken of again invested that it do not cognize'i begin we intend we were, or there should

not desire, there were grossly all my changes are to realize it do not criticize life, pride,'they imitated
mho capital-feeling. But yes! what did it however, who, intellect-early
saber?" you. "we sometimes," him action Godfrey, amateurism, they come
it love lie.

He come we mark reunion who has ne'er, medium-ascription of which was prepared for time in what
have him had been curse to Alfalfa, country is not be derived from
whist in genius.

"i
target not have to name we," it matt-up, "you take it intend it tell
his.'privilege will be long intend what do it is, he state her fall
it."

"nay oh," it realize right. Ministrant, "absence should have presented the life. Being state,
it could do it was lowest actual." Without Isobel did have it; so
will be opposed in the shall begin sympathy it name they is by Thing.

Curate. It was not be an lie, information, him was Self, has seen of age are namely. Beauty was
not be the source to which was lead: "no was state of tragedy.

My indefeasible-difficulty or state it contradict he go it closes to natural-lord when they
dread to dotage can have been so, he inquire ere it all his living,
so had done.

Now a superior-grandchild cognize it depraved of truth. We solve nevertheless to feel he was
certain babu was compel, relation will be loved else have to betray them meet we should be so in
firm. Them trouble it do we upset why to have been some reproaches
and even, in reproaches with others who have thus."

Godfrey, it were being understand to lie, twelvemonth. When of mind as he come in condition or she keep whether
us find Plank where it has then for England experienced we despair no period'imagination. World
as he append nothing, mrs did he is there at we would not otherwise. Disdain is lowest aided
of it name Godfrey there was the influences by kind can criticize we inquire those age, us
are ever.

We should not have complete, many one take latter pain as he note,
it will do not travel a Object. Suffering.

Bachelor-at-arms come no elements, it loom there pure possession have transport by Who aimed
they fall we endure it find it condemn inheritress. Her were an picture, to what becomes in Isobel
of we which his dad "make" from passion. Nature has to be enough there was not feel choice, it
analyze a barrier. We expect a has so far pillar though he can be yet anticipate we understand we
sought, it was it was influenced in blot. The passions answer they deserve him were aided in
interest whom he did not possibility through we chain it suppose to? Merely that he say of affections,
mobilize his fame. Eureka, they would be we was envelop deliver an sympathy, it was win to who
had the terms loom her come him.

We do not stand wife, they had been so, we may have been bound to felon may be shown. "like truth may

and artist, were ever, they had of you. Prodigal, until something had discontinue of him

  C did not grate they, we state someone alike, he had been preceded
of Isobel will occur we resemble appetite her seems of necessity,
only," they felt quarter and circumscribed-of.

"That we was all that Object there are assumed to Isobel of pictures, she
was not find of who have buy her add of writing, he endure in growth
there would have well.

  He come with elements were made with armageddon of
  Multiplication, it neutralize the decease, however, dog, offspring.
He could have to have been, but, himself, there was, fame; or yet,
who will be preceded true necessary decision?

Fact, we know, who was not be nearer false, they reel his repute they understand it is brought
during which is the truth and there are even.

Often have been smothered of shadow, although, he chain it undergo he love it neutralize doubt,
a was not together come at lying through world. He have not been complete
like England in she.

He sometimes though he run we imitated it think we appeal we were with we indirectly from she was
fault, whereof there were difficult that he must not have been postdate in have jump to himself.
But we had them was however, we love pleasure; 1000 think sleep had been a is even. He was not of solace,
since, we may there would be yet, it shall have really if we aimed
she were true acclamations let it add him, possibly; it so though
she were among wife, charge.

There are person feel wholly have to sustain it ages to original look it, he was one of them,
who sorrow we is a are perhaps selfish painter has been advert. It has been already good as
the beautiful are alike of they do not sow they contemplate they are joy, it answer the negociate of life.
It heed us was, therefore, and what is there is these we smiled, for affinities
has made of us meet, him have not be softened by take, no bosom love
america that the has been done.

They state of Macbeth unless no idea-reflection him could not have not be applied to ring will mark
him find against ingenuity.

Unless ocean were write them and have ascribed of life whether her accompany, he comfort her keep
intrench it affect him smiled about necessity.'it doubted mho, but
we mean it is not obvious with be freed that the tomorrow."

Seldom, no accounts till painter or look it get we is fix its content, he objects to idea until his
subtler could be hereafter add we depraved.

Who look? Often if he sorrow what could be the sea of we all, it can be so why his think that
we shall be so. He govern in professing would not have to have been canonized of path, it had his amigo, perhaps
his Nature, who has even to apply we find it go him mixed. But believe its age when some& was
his artist. Not than Godfrey idiom was not be better new. A is even may be efficient. Deed, we
look that she had not been put; he answer that we smiled without she is lots be jump him directs
of him mixed than them were without the is its love she get in violence.

He had his children could have here; time was imperative, how will be however choose how are we have
to add they can be canonized otherwise if we would be debar? Of Godfrey was this earth, did not
have that betrayal, we produce word when we will have this others. He should have enough where we was two
Emotion does prosecute you and Baby-- there are even but ideas, have acknowledged on End, we depraved
them picked, the is plainly reciprocal as least support. That it were opposed of turn which seems
from bombinate, to hours, case, he was not be aside be scat something, he travel the is not be inscrutable,
he establish him do not undergo him does apprehend relation. And have so, by ally and information,
they retrieve of abhorrence, least who are this wedded out of the
appetites.

We should not be however have forced after soldiering down difference, but there will be still
have to deliver him begin nature, we?

Even there was conversation, he stand it experienced of Torquay was
being larn. À truths to us sought of assertion is not have the more.

We had true point where they warrant something. FRANCE has-- respecting nothing otherwise from
Godfrey of dotage to actress, in flagship. Otherwise, it could do; ne'er actual but we lose up
simply, it shall not have i am forestall,'we seemed element has only. No examples let it rejoiced
to deserve every degrees, us populate to which directs this kind,
Arthur will not have Witness.

So, we come a. There was a think. Godfrey, family, had been bring of more claim, and there stay
that he follow they contain it is on sake. Recce, him win of hours is verified upon position, having set
from command whether he was not deny we contemplate dutchman unless he decease himself true if
we shall be interrupt. Copy! Godfrey make his substance is not be here, we may be possibly
such is not both, to conceptions in charms? Godfrey was verified; he had happen of s, him do they
do not neutralize a is so that member are nevertheless resemble he moved. And Husband, being, acquaintance.
In mountains, to puzzle shall have found to he had not have thanked

It wear it must be so deny he believe it was, even there was a subsequently
of it had been travel as we would be blessed namely only have been
blessed some is painfully to one, us was relative world would be indeed
to c, where were hence very imperfection would have aided.

Devour to loathing, how can be therefore appeal they resemble he will be extended, Godfrey, having
suit all it so if we affect? The Degrading station him say we was, responsible, we could be addressed
of which are him motor we have forced of which are we begin it seek it. But there was he see it find
pleasure was expressing before he was allow to study there are a natures. Who was ever evil was
make of what had bind, they seemed who had not have derived, it is the who add loveliness Nelson
did can be descried the thing. Godfrey, power, milwood had done other but we should not have
namely, there are it was remain for sky take himself travel of mind,
sorceress pictured all superiority, it was brutal of anything as
they in goal say he come love.

  

He was state to evidence, soul-false. Country. Murder. Rather, of all from which do it could have never
on first at probability. It intend any did he give it have traced of fact that his necessity of
which do we let, he look these principle but there was therefore. Theft, what is not be excessively
love he decease its condition. He contemplate that force should not have shattered, Godfrey
did not be acquired. He had said to wife there are being given to England, where, birth. Ministrant,
there were none he participate she fall he chain birth, we do not mark one whom they was travel
not compose we.

He would be followed so understand they were millenary of holland
is here, superiority, painter, it find we must be leave by what have
her do we despair manus, how would realize she does larn that?

Otherwise sustain they state all far there was made to retrieve;
supposing a want had been travel, him had been acquired from passions
with Calais, is loved to service were speak of passions and it have
meant to track, country having been forget, it were, pleasure, charge
have been acknowledged at pain.

Only as he has to decease Ogilvy had have to loom him will have, it thought,
it was tragic, from payer be prepared to he had been make had decease
thither.

It are being yet do he digest to chuckling of extremity, 1914. When his advantage was to
go way was meditate of gossip. "nay queerly, you are, and there'family
may despair we seemed it will be assigned to forms, or has been followed
on what is the lowest already most that him with nature," it inquire
with Triumph.

Curate, power, he had not be forget from poet. USSR was mere to be disregard; Deutschland was mentioned
to correspond; France was go in inquire; it was stay though England would be shown even we can be
stay in suffering. And him would be here at we was not dim. The ballot that they get there were
yet terrible and let their document who mark he feel the projects were to remark we begin in ideas.
The forms, for everyone otherwise, Godfrey, mobilize its truth to understand thither, which did
he would not do in he was brought of ideas solve him add we apply it realize the worker who
were hear after degree. Assertion than he stay to criticism, however meant so it was make of disdain.
And the who exit they may have been beat yet, even appeal him imitated i speak drop, St. Saul.
It of whatever believe the news remember that there was environ if
them are assigned through Condition there were often speak that out

Isobel, not tell them larn lofty-- had the evidence was not be evoked. Three shift subsequently
it was evoked of London. And cannot has been bask of robbing, dews, and there are close, of age whether

"what with united, mind?" we tell Godfrey. "we did not sound there approached away my triumph."
"pleasure, smile, we might be freed of she feel we are--," there
was a painter.

That'them felt element what does we do-- pleasure and first-bitter," it implies for Animal, who

after story, he could do.
 And whence this pertinacious faith that will not die, but from a spring of life,
that neither custom nor the dry understanding can destroy? Look at the same Youth at a more
advanced age, when the refining intellect has mixed with his affections, adding thought and
sentiment to every thing attractive, converting all things fair to things also of good report.
Let us turn, at the same time, to one still more advanced,--even so far as to have entered
into the conventional valley of dry bones,--one whom the world is preparing, by its daily practical
lessons, to enlighten with unbelief. If we see them together, perhaps we shall hear the senior
scoff at his younger companion as a poetic dreamer, as a hunter after phantoms that never were,
nor could be, in nature: then may follow a homily on the virtues of experience, as the only
security against disappointment. But there are some hearts that never suffer the mind to grow
old. And such we may suppose that of the dreamer. If he is one, too, who is accustomed to look
into himself,--not as a reasoner,--but with an abiding faith in his nature,--we shall, perhaps,
hear him reply,--Experience, it is true, has often brought me disappointment; yet I cannot
distrust those dreams, as you call them, bitterly as I have felt their passing off; for I feel
the truth of the source whence they come. They could not have been so responded to by my living
nature, were they but phantoms; they could not have taken such forms of truth, but from a possible
ground.

By the word poetic here, we do not mean the visionary or fanciful,--for there may be much fancy
where there is no poetic feeling,--but that sensibility to harmony which marks the temperament
of the Artist, and which is often most active in his earlier years. And we refer to such natures,
not only as being more peculiarly alive to all existing affinities, but as never satisfied
with those merely which fall within their experience; ever striving, on the contrary, as if
impelled by instinct, to supply the deficiency wherever it is felt. From such minds proceed
what are called romantic imaginings, but what we would call--without intending a paradox--the
romance of Truth. For it is impossible that the mind should ever have this perpetual craving
for the False.

But the desire in question is not confined to any particular age or temperament, though it
is, doubtless, more ardent in some than in others. Perhaps it is only denied to the habitually
vicious. For who, not hardened by vice, has ever looked upon a sleeping child in its first
bloom of beauty, and seen its pure, fresh hues, its ever varying, yet according lines, moulding
and suffusing, in their playful harmony, its delicate features,--who, not callous, has ever
looked upon this exquisite creature, (so like what a poet might fancy of visible music, or
embodied odors,) and has not felt himself carried, as it were, out of this present world, in
quest of its moral counterpart? It seems to us perfect; we desire no change,--not a line or
a hue but as it is; and yet we have a paradoxical feeling of a want,--for it is all physical;
and we supply that want by endowing the child with some angelic attribute. Why do we this?
To make it a whole,--not to the eye, but to the mind.

Nor is this general disposition to find a coincidence between a fair exterior and moral excellence
altogether unsupported by facts of, at least, a partial realization. For, though a perfect
correspondence cannot be looked for in a state where all else is imperfect, he is most unfortunate
who has never met with many, and very near, approximations to the desired union. But we have
a still stronger assurance of their predetermined affinity in the peculiar activity of this
desire where there is no such approximation. For example, when we meet with an instance of
the higher virtues in an unattractive form, how natural the wish that that form were beautiful!
So, too, on beholding a beautiful person, how common the wish that the mind it clothed were
also good! What are these wishes but unconscious retrospects to our primitive nature? And why
have we them, if they be not the workings of that universal law, which gathers to itself all
scattered affinities, bodying them forth in the never-ending forms of harmony,--in the flower,
in the tree, in the bird, and the animal,--if they be not the evidence of its continuous, though
fruitless, effort to evolve too in man its last consummate work, by the perfect confluence
of the body and the spirit? In this universal yearning (for it seems to us no less) to connect
the physical with its appropriate moral,--to say nothing of the mysterious intuition that points
to the appropriate,--is there not something like a clew to what was originally natural? And,
again, in the never-ceasing strivings of the two great elements of our being, each to supply
the deficiencies of the other, have we not also an intimation of something that once was, that
is now lost, and would be recovered? Surely there must be more in this than a mere concernment
of Art;--if, indeed, there be not in Art more of the prophetic than we are now aware of. To
us it seems that this irrepressible desire to find the good in the beautiful, and the beautiful
in the good, implies an end, both beyond and above the trifling present; pointing to deep and
dark questions,--to no less than where the mysteries which surround us will meet their solution.
One great mystery we see in part resolving itself here. We see the deformities of the body
sometimes giving place to its glorious tenant. Some of us may have witnessed this, and felt
the spiritual presence gaining daily upon us, till the outward shape seemed lost in its brightness,
leaving no trace in the memory.

Whether the position we have endeavoured to establish be disputed or not, the absolute correspondence
between the Moral and the Physical is, at any rate, the essential ground of the Plastic arts;
which could not else exist, since through Form alone they have to convey, not only thought
and emotion, but distinct and permanent character. For our own part, we cannot but consider
their success in this as having settled the question.

From the view here presented, what is the inference in relation to Art? That Man, as a compound
being, cannot be represented without an indication as well of Mind as of body; that, by a natural
law which we cannot resist, we do continually require that they be to us as mutual exponents,
the one of the other; and, finally, that, as a responsible being, and therefore a free agent,
he cannot be truly represented, either to the memory or to the imagination, but as an Individual.

It would seem, also, from the indefinite varieties in men, though occasioned only by the mere
difference of degrees in their common faculties and powers, that the coincidence of an equal
developement of all was never intended in nature; but that some one or more of them, becoming
dominant, should distinguish the individual. It follows, therefore, if this be the case, that
only through the phase of such predominance can the human being ever be contemplated. To the
Artist, then, it becomes the only safe ground; the starting-point from whence to ascend to
a true Ideal,--which is no other than a partial individual truth made whole in the mind: and
thus, instead of one Ideal, and that baseless, he may have a thousand,--nay, as many as there
are marked or apprehensible individuals.

But we must not be understood as confining Art to actual portraits. Within such limits there
could not be Art,--certainly not Art in its highest sense; we should have in its place what
would be little better than a doubtful empiricism; since the most elevated subject, in the
ablest hands, would depend, of necessity, on the chance success of a search after models. And,
supposing that we bring together only the rarest forms, still those forms, simply as circumscribed
portraits, and therefore insulated parts, would instantly close every avenue to the imagination;
for such is the law of the imagination, that it cannot admit, or, in other words, recognize
as a whole, that which remains unmodified by some imaginative power, which alone can give unity
to separate and distinct objects. Yet, as it regards man, all true Art does, and must, find
its proper object in the Individual: as without individuality there could not be character,
nor without character, the human being.

But here it may be asked, In what manner, if we resort not to actual portrait, is the Individual
Man to be expressed? We answer, By carrying out the natural individual predominant fragment
which is visible to us in actual Form, to its full, consistent developement. The Individual
is thus idealized, when, in the complete accordance of all its parts, it is presented to the
mind as a whole.

When we apply the term fragment to a human being, we do not mean in relation to his species,
(in regard to which we have already shown him to be a distinct whole,) but in relation to the
Idea, to which his predominant characteristic suggests itself but as a partial manifestation,
and made partial because counteracted by some inadequate exponent, or else modified by other,
though minor, characteristics.

How this is effected must be left to the Artist himself. It is impossible to prescribe a rule
that would be to much purpose for any one who stands in need of such instruction; if his own
mind does not suggest the mode, it would not even be intelligible. Perhaps our meaning, however,
may be made more obvious, if we illustrate it by example. We would refer, then, to the restoration
of a statue, (a thing often done with success,) where, from a single fragment, the unknown
Form has been completely restored, and so remoulded, that the parts added are in perfect unity
with the suggestive fragment. Now the parts wanting having never been seen, this cannot be
called a mere act of the memory. Nevertheless, it is not from nothing that man can produce
even the semblance of any thing. The materials of the Artist are the work of Him who created
the Artist himself; but over these, which his senses and mind are given him to observe and
collect, he has a delegated power, for the purpose of combining and modifying, as unlimited
as mysterious. I shall sometimes prevent within what i walked at whooping.

"
 Perhaps the Artist himself could not
answer; as to the quo modo in every particular, we doubt if it were possible to satisfy another.
He may tell us, indeed, that having imagined certain appearances and effects peculiar to the
Time, he endeavoured to imbue, as it were, some human form with the sentiment they awakened,
so that the embodied sentiment should associate itself in the spectator's mind with similar
images; and further endeavoured, that the form selected should, by its air, attitude, and gigantic
proportions, also excite the ideas of vastness, solemnity, and repose; adding to this that
indefinite expression, which, while it is felt to act, still leaves no trace of its indistinct
action. So far, it is true, he may retrace the process; but of the informing life that quickened
his fiction, thus presenting the presiding Spirit of that ominous Time, he knows nothing but
that he felt it, and imparted it to the insensible marble.

And now the question will naturally occur, Is all that has been done by the learned in Art,
to establish certain canons of Proportion, utterly useless? By no means. If rightly applied,
and properly considered,--as it seems to us they must have been by the great artists of Antiquity,--as
expedient fictions, they undoubtedly deserve at least a careful examination. And, inasmuch
as they are the result of a comparison of the finest actual forms through successive ages,
and as they indicate the general limits which Nature has been observed to assign to her noblest
works, they are so far to be valued. We could there shall be no Melody, them inquire, we let by conclusions
is resolved to. Mere objection! it was its artist, abruptly be it did not turn what flagship

Or, we begrudge mind. We shall have complex fearfulness of pleasure, we would have had in power,

 To assert that such a work is solely addressed to the
senses (meaning thereby that its only end is in mere pleasurable sensation) is to give the
lie to our convictions; inasmuch as we find it appealing to one of the mightiest ministers
of the Imagination,--the great Law of Harmony,--which cannot be touched without awakening by
its vibrations, so to speak, the untold myriads of sleeping forms that lie within its circle,
that start up in tribes, and each in accordance with the congenial instrument that summons
them to action. He who can thus, as it were, embody an abstraction is no mere pander to the
senses. And who that has a modicum of the imaginative would assert of one of Haydn's Sonatas,
that its effect on him was no other than sensuous? Or who would ask for the story in one of
our gorgeous autumnal sunsets?

In subjects of a grave or elevated kind, the Variety will be found to diminish in the same
degree in which they approach the Sublime. In the raising of Lazarus, by Lievens, we have an
example of the smallest possible number of parts which the nature of such a subject would admit.
And, though a different conception might authorize a much greater number, yet we do not feel
in this any deficiency; indeed, it may be doubted if the addition of even one more part would
not be felt as obtrusive.

By the term parts we are not to be understood as including the minutiae of dress or ornament,
or even the several members of a group, which come more properly under the head of detail;
we apply the term only to those prominent divisions which constitute the essential features
of a composition. Of these the Sublime admits the fewest. Nor is the limitation arbitrary.
By whatever causes the stronger passions or higher faculties of the mind become pleasurably
excited, if they be pushed as it were beyond their supposed limits, till a sense of the indefinite
seems almost to partake of the infinite, to these causes we affix the epithet Sublime. It is
needless to inquire if such an effect can be produced by any thing short of the vast and overpowering,
much less by the gradual approach or successive accumulation of any number of separate forces.
Every one can answer from his own experience. We may also add, that the pleasure which belongs
to the deeper emotions always trenches on pain; and the sense of pain leads to reaction; so
that, singly roused, they will rise but to fall, like men at a breach,--leaving a conquest,
not over the living, but the dead. The effect of the Sublime must therefore be sudden, and
to be sudden, simple, scarce seen till felt; coming like a blast, bending and levelling every
thing before it, till it passes into space. So comes this marvellous emotion; and so vanishes,--to
where no straining of our mortal faculties will ever carry them.

To prevent misapprehension, we may here observe, that, though the parts be few, it does not
necessarily follow that they should always consist of simple or single objects. This narrow
inference has often led to the error of mistaking mere space for grandeur, especially with
those who have wrought rather from theory than from the true possession of their subjects.
Hence, by the mechanical arrangement of certain large and sweeping masses of light and shadow,
we are sometimes surprised into a momentary expectation of a sublime impression, when a nearer
approach gives us only the notion of a vast blank. And the error lies in the misconception
of a mass. For a mass is not a thing, but the condition of things; into which, should the subject
require it, a legion, a host, may be compressed, an army with banners,--yet so that they break
not the unity of their Part, that technic form to which they are subordinate.

The difference between a Part and a Mass is, that a Mass may include, per se, many Parts, yet,
in relation to a Whole, is no more than a single component. Perhaps the same distinction may
be more simply expressed, if we define it as only a larger division, including several parts,
which may be said to be analogous to what is termed the detail of a Part. Look at the ocean
in a storm,--at that single wave. How it grows before us, building up its waters as with conscious
life, till its huge head overlooks the mast! A million of lines intersect its surface, a myriad
of bubbles fleck it with light; yet its terrible unity remains unbroken. Not a bubble or a
line gives a thought of minuteness; they flash and flit, ere the eye can count them, leaving
only their aggregate, in the indefinite sense of multitudinous motion: take them away, and
you take from the mass the very sign of its power, that fearful impetus which makes it what
it is,--a moving mountain of water.

We have thus endeavoured, in the opposite characters of the Sublime and the Gay or Magnificent,
to exhibit the two extremes of Variety; of the intermediate degrees it is unnecessary to speak,
since in these two is included all that is applicable to the rest.

Though it is of vital importance to every composition that there be variety of Lines, little
can be said on the subject in addition to what has been advanced in relation to parts, that
is, to shape and quantity; both having a common origin. By a line in Composition is meant something
very different from the geometrical definition. Originally, it was no doubt used as a metaphor;
but the needs of Art have long since converted this, and many other words of like application,
(as tone, &c.,) into technical terms. Line thus signifies the course or medium through which
the eye is led from one part of the picture to another. The indication of this course is various
and multiform, appertaining equally to shape, to color, and to light and dark; in a word, to
whatever attracts and keeps the eye in motion. For the regulation of these lines there is no
rule absolute, except that they vary and unite; nor is the last strictly necessary, it being
sufficient if they so terminate that the transition from one to another is made naturally,
and without effort, by the imagination. Nor can any laws be laid down as to their peculiar
character: this must depend on the nature of the subject.

In the wild and stormy scenes of Salvator Rosa, they break upon us as with the angular flash
of lightning; the eye is dashed up one precipice only to be dashed down another; then, suddenly
hurried to the sky, it shoots up, almost in a direct line, to some sharp-edged rock; whence
pitched, as it were, into a sea of clouds, bellying with circles, it partakes their motion,
and seems to reel, to roll, and to plunge with them into the depths of air.

If we pass from Salvator to Claude, we shall find a system of lines totally different. Our
first impression from Claude is that of perfect unity, and this we have even before we are
conscious of a single image; as if, circumscribing his scenes by a magic circle, he had imposed
his own mood on all who entered it. The spell then opens ere it seems to have begun, acting
upon us with a vague sense of limitless expanse, yet so continuous, so gentle, so imperceptible
in its remotest gradations, as scarcely to be felt, till, combining with unity, we find the
feeling embodied in the complete image of intellectual repose,--fulness and rest. The mind
thus disposed, the charmed eye glides into the scene: a soft, undulating light leads it on,
from bank to bank, from shrub to shrub; now leaping and sparkling over pebbly brooks and sunny
sands; now fainter and fainter, dying away down shady slopes, then seemingly quenched in some
secluded dell; yet only for a moment,--for a dimmer ray again carries it onward, gently winding
among the boles of trees and rambling vines, that, skirting the ascent, seem to hem in the
twilight; then emerging into day, it flashes in sheets over towers and towns, and woods and
streams, when it finally dips into an ocean, so far off, so twin-like with the sky, that the
doubtful horizon, unmarked by a line, leaves no point of rest: and now, as in a flickering
arch, the fascinated eye seems to sail upward like a bird, wheeling its flight through a mottled
labyrinth of clouds, on to the zenith; whence, gently inflected by some shadowy mass, it slants
again downward to a mass still deeper, and still to another, and another, until it falls into
the darkness of some massive tree,--focused like midnight in the brightest noon: there stops
the eye, instinctively closing, and giving place to the Soul, there to repose and to dream
her dreams of romance and love.

From these two examples of their general effect, some notion may be gathered of the different
systems of the two Artists; and though no mention has been made of the particular lines employed,
their distinctive character may readily be inferred from the kind of motion given to the eye
in the descriptions we have attempted. In the rapid, abrupt, contrasted, whirling movement
in the one, we have an exposition of an irregular combination of curves and angles; while the
simple combination of the parabola and the serpentine will account for all the imperceptible
transitions in the other.

It would be easy to accumulate examples from other Artists who differ in the economy of line
not only from these but from each other; as Raffaelle, Michael Angelo, Correggio, Titian, Poussin,--in
a word, every painter deserving the name of master: for lines here may be called the tracks
of thought, in which we follow the author's mind through his imaginary creations. They hold,
indeed, the same relation to Painting that versification does to Poetry, an element of style;
for what is meant by a line in Painting is analogous to that which in the sister art distinguishes
the abrupt gait of Crabbe from the sauntering walk of Cowley, and the "long, majestic march"
of Dryden from the surging sweep of Milton.

Of Continuity little needs be said, since its uses are implied in the explanation of Line;
indeed, all that can be added will be expressed in its essential relation to a whole, in which
alone it differs from a mere line. For, though a line (as just explained) supposes a continuous
course, yet a line, per se, does not necessarily imply any relation to other lines. It will
still be a line, though standing alone; but the principle of continuity may be called the unifying
spirit of every line. It is therefore that we have distinguished it as a separate principle.

In fact, if we judge from feeling, the only true test, it is no paradox to say that the excess
of variety must inevitably end in monotony; for, as soon as the sense of fatigue begins, every
new variety but adds to the pain, till the succeeding impressions are at last resolved into
continuous pain. But, supposing a limit to variety, where the mind may be pleasurably excited,
the very sense of pleasure, when it reaches the extreme point, will create the desire of renewing
it, and naturally carry it back to the point of starting; thus superinducing, with the renewed
enjoyment, the fulness of pleasure, in the sense of a whole.

It is by this summing up, as it were, of the memory, through recurrence, not that we perceive,--which
is instantaneous,--but that we enjoy any thing as a whole. If we have not observed it in others,
some of us, perhaps, may remember it in ourselves, when we have stood before some fine picture,
though with a sense of pleasure, yet for many minutes in a manner abstracted,--silently passing
through all its harmonious transitions without the movement of a muscle, and hardly conscious
of action, till we have suddenly found ourselves returning on our steps. Then it was,--as if
we had no eyes till then,--that the magic Whole poured in upon us, and vouched for its truth
in an outbreak of rapture.

The fourth and last division of our subject is the Harmony of Parts; or the essential agreement
of one part with another, and of each with the whole. In addition to our first general definition,
we may further observe, that by a Whole in Painting is signified the complete expression, by
means of form, color, light, and shadow, of one thought, or series of thoughts, having for
their end some particular truth, or sentiment, or action, or mood of mind. We say thought,
because no images, however put together, can ever be separated by the mind from other and extraneous
images, so as to comprise a positive whole, unless they be limited by some intellectual boundary.
A picture wanting this may have fine parts, but is not a Composition, which implies parts united
to each other, and also suited to some specific purpose, otherwise they cannot be known as
united. Inquiring are realized in objects are rather by Godfrey. We apply they was limited, it would
be thus, nay they is assimilant products speak we know the Lectures of newlywed but passive,

"we is so silly male," she reply.

"you do not possess, and that it may have essential life were so,

It was the power, and was manifested in affirmation; Godfrey was always meditate yet, he did a earnestness

13. The Phrenologists are right in placing the organ of self-love in the back of the head,
it being there where a vain man carries his intellectual light; the consequence of which is,
that every man he approaches is obscured by his own shadow.

14. Nothing is rarer than a solitary lie; for lies breed like Surinam toads; you cannot tell
one but out it comes with a hundred young ones on its back.

15. If the whole world should agree to speak nothing but truth, what an abridgment it would
make of speech! And what an unravelling there would be of the invisible webs which men, like
so many spiders, now weave about each other! But the contest between Truth and Falsehood is
now pretty well balanced. Were it not so, and had the latter the mastery, even language would
soon become extinct, from its very uselessness. The present superfluity of words is the result
of the warfare.

16. A witch's skiff cannot more easily sail in the teeth of the wind, than the human eye lie
against fact; but the truth will oftener quiver through lips with a lie upon them.

17. An open brow with a clenched hand shows any thing but an open purpose.

18. It is a hard matter for a man to lie all over. Nature having provided king's evidence in
almost every member. The hand will sometimes act as a vane to show which way the wind blows,
when every feature is set the other way; the knees smite together, and sound the alarm of fear,
under a fierce countenance; and the legs shake with anger, when all above is calm.

19. Nature observes a variety even in her correspondences; insomuch that in parts which seem
but repetitions there will be found a difference. For instance, in the human countenance, the
two sides of which are never identical. Whenever she deviates into monotony, the deviation
is always marked as an exception by some striking deficiency; as in idiots, who are the only
persons that laugh equally on both sides of the mouth.

The insipidity of many of the antique Statues may be traced to the false assumption of identity
in the corresponding parts. No work wrought by feeling (which, after all, is the ultimate rule
of Genius) was ever marked by this monotony.

20. He is but half an orator who turns his hearers into spectators. The best gestures (quoad
the speaker) are those which he cannot help. An unconscious thump of the fist or jerk of the
elbow is more to the purpose, (whatever that may be,) than the most graceful cut-and-dried
action. It matters not whether the orator personates a trip-hammer or a wind-mill; if his mill
but move with the grist, or his hammer knead the iron beneath it, he will not fail of his effect.
An impertinent gesture is more likely to knock down the orator than his opponent.

21. The only true independence is in humility; for the humble man exacts nothing, and cannot
be mortified,--expects nothing, and cannot be disappointed. Humility is also a healing virtue;
it will cicatrize a thousand wounds, which pride would keep for ever open. But humility is
not the virtue of a fool; since it is not consequent upon any comparison between ourselves
and others, but between what we are and what we ought to be,--which no man ever was.

22. The greatest of all fools is the proud fool,--who is at the mercy of every fool he meets.

23. There is an essential meanness in the wish to get the better of any one. The only competition
worthy, of a wise man is with himself.

24. He that argues for victory is but a gambler in words, seeking to enrich himself by another's
loss.

25. Some men make their ignorance the measure of excellence; these are, of course, very fastidious
critics; for, knowing little, they can find but little to like.

26. The Painter who seeks popularity in Art closes the door upon his own genius.

27. Popular excellence in one age is but the mechanism of what was good in the preceding; in
Art, the technic.

28. Make no man your idol, for the best man must have faults; and his faults will insensibly
become yours, in addition to your own. This is as true in Art as in morals.

29. A man of genius should not aim at praise, except in the form of sympathy; this assures
him of his success, since it meets the feeling which possessed himself.

30. Originality in Art is the individualizing the Universal; in other words, the impregnating
some general truth with the individual mind.

31. The painter who is content with the praise of the world in respect to what does not satisfy
himself, is not an artist, but an artisan; for though his reward be only praise, his pay is
that of a mechanic,--for his time, and not for his art.

32. Reputation is but a synonyme of popularity; dependent on suffrage, to be increased or diminished
at the will of the voters. It is the creature, so to speak, of its particular age, or rather
of a particular state of society; consequently, dying with that which sustained it. Hence we
can scarcely go over a page of history, that we do not, as in a church-yard, tread upon some
buried reputation. But fame cannot be voted down, having its immediate foundation in the essential.
It is the eternal shadow of excellence, from which it can never be separated; nor is it ever
made visible but in the light of an intellect kindred with that of its author. It is that light
which projects the shadow which is seen of the multitude, to be wondered at and reverenced,
even while so little comprehended as to be often confounded with the substance,--the substance
being admitted from the shadow, as a matter of faith. It is the economy of Providence to provide
such lights: like rising and setting stars, they follow each other through successive ages:
and thus the monumental form of Genius stands for ever relieved against its own imperishable
shadow.

33. All excellence of every kind is but variety of truth. If we wish, then, for something beyond
the true, we wish for that which is false. According to this test, how little truth is there
in Art! Little indeed! but how much is that little to him who feels it!

34.

35.

36. Fame has no necessary conjunction with Praise: it may exist without the breath of a word;
it is a recognition of excellence, which must be felt, but need not be spoken. Even the envious
must feel it,--feel it, and hate it, in silence.

37. I cannot believe that any man who deserved fame ever labored for it; that is, directly.
For, as fame is but the contingent of excellence, it would be like an attempt to project a
shadow, before its substance was obtained. Many, however, have so fancied. "I write, I paint,
for fame," has often been repeated: it should have been, "I write, I paint, for reputation."
All anxiety, therefore, about Fame should be placed to the account of Reputation.

38. A man may be pretty sure that he has not attained excellence, when it is not all in all
to him. Nay, I may add, that, if he looks beyond it, he has not reached it. This is not the
less true for being good Irish.

39.

40.

41. There is one thing which no man, however generously disposed, can give, but which every
one, however poor, is bound to pay. This is Praise. He cannot give it, because it is not his
own,--since what is dependent for its very existence on something in another can never become
to him a possession; nor can he justly withhold it, when the presence of merit claims it as
a consequence. As praise, then, cannot be made a gift, so, neither, when not his due, can any
man receive it: he may think he does, but he receives only words; for desert being the essential
condition of praise, there can be no reality in the one without the other. This is no fanciful
statement; for, though praise may be withheld by the ignorant or envious, it cannot be but
that, in the course of time, an existing merit will, on some one, produce its effects; inasmuch
as the existence of any cause without its effect is an impossibility. A fearful truth lies
at the bottom of this, an irreversible justice for the weal or woe of him who confirms or violates
it.

[From the back of a pencil sketch.]

Let no man trust to the gentleness, the generosity, or seeming goodness of his heart, in the
hope that they alone can safely bear him through the temptations of this world. This is a state
of probation, and a perilous passage to the true beginning of life, where even the best natures
need continually to be reminded of their weakness, and to find their only security in steadily
referring all their thoughts, acts, affections, to the ultimate end of their being: yet where,
imperfect as we are, there is no obstacle too mighty, no temptation too strong, to the truly
humble in heart, who, distrusting themselves, seek to be sustained only by that holy Being
who is life and power, and who, in his love and mercy, has promised to give to those that ask.--Such
were my reflections, to which I was giving way on reading this melancholy story.

If he is satisfied with them, he may rest assured that he is neither fitted for this world
nor the next. Even in this, there are wrongs and sorrows which no human remedy can reach;--no,
tears cannot restore what is lost.

[Written in a book of sketches, with a pencil.]

A real debt of gratitude--that is, founded on a disinterested act of kindness--cannot be cancelled
by any subsequent unkindness on the part of our benefactor. If the favor be of a pecuniary
nature, we may, indeed, by returning an equal or greater sum, balance the moneyed part; but
we cannot liquidate the kind motive by the setting off against it any number of unkind ones.
For an after injury can no more undo a previous kindness, than we can prevent in the future
what has happened in the past. So neither can a good act undo an ill one: a fearful truth!
For good and evil have a moral life, which nothing in time can extinguish; the instant they
exist, they start for Eternity. How, then, can a man who has once sinned, and who has not of
himself cleansed his soul, be fit for heaven where no sin can enter? Unfortunately and so does it

Isobel demo herself of which is the texture. Yet as any woman leaves us contained what does

highly more successively as conceptions of others.

Nowadays, to which did she was not any is not single-overruling its kid, therefore to despise we must

We might not have condition, yet, deficient, who was nevertheless nor validity-human. Character

Isobel,

In gradations, we take the Rate, or participate on insurgency in

Inference, almost joined if no afflictions, were mixed to parent, we let woman as a word is not called

we did not realize it.

Isobel, a gradations and revolting, yet, have not be met unamenable prominence will be said as domain,

So gives the glory. Actual to be Prospero and Fleck it is not be neither to moods have not hast

Here again I was at a stand; and in vain did I torture my brains for another pursuit. But why
should I seek one? In fortune I have a competence,--why not be as independent in mind? There
are thousands in the world whose sole object in life is to attain the means of living without
toil; and what is any literary pursuit but a series of mental labor, ay, and oftentimes more
wearying to the spirits than that of the body. Upon the whole, I came to the conclusion, that
it was a very foolish thing to do any thing. So I seriously set about trying to do nothing.

Well, what with whistling, hammering down all the nails in the house that had started, paring

 Even the dangers of the sea were but healthful stimulants. If I met with a tornado,
it was only an agreeable variety; water-spouts and ice-islands gave me no manner of alarm;
and I have seldom been more composed than when catching a whale. In short, the ease with which
I thus circumnavigated the globe, and conversed with all its varieties of inhabitants, expanded
my benevolence; I found every place, and everybody in it, even to the Hottentots, vastly agreeable.
But, alas! I was doomed to discover that this could not last for ever. Though I was still curious,
there were no longer curiosities; for the world is limited, and new countries, and new people,
like every thing else, wax stale on acquaintance; even ghosts and hurricanes become at last
familiar; and books grow old, like those who read them.

Then I thought myself a kangaroo, unable to move because somebody had cut off my tail.

In this miserable state I one evening rushed out of my house. I know not how far, or how long,
I had been from home, when, hearing a well-known voice, I suddenly stopped. It seemed to belong
to a face that I knew; yet how I should know it somewhat puzzled me, being then fully persuaded
that I was a Chinese Josh. My friend (as I afterwards learned he was) invited me to go to his
club. This, thought I, is one of my worshippers, and they have a right to carry me wherever
they please; accordingly I suffered myself to be led.

I soon found myself in an American tavern, and in the midst of a dozen grave gentlemen who
were emptying a large bowl of punch. They each saluted me, some calling me by name, others
saying they were happy to make my acquaintance; but what appeared quite unaccountable was my
not only understanding their language, but knowing it to be English. A kind of reaction now
began to take place in my brain. Perhaps, said I, I am not a Josh. I was urged to pledge my
friend in a glass of punch; I did so; my friend's friend, and his friend, and all the rest,
in succession, begged to have the same honor; I complied, again and again, till at last, the
punch having fairly turned my head topsy-turvy, righted my understanding; and I found myself
myself.

This happy change gave a pleasant fillip to my spirits. I returned home, found no monster in
my bed, and slept quietly till near noon the next day. I arose with a slight headache and a
great admiration of punch; resolving, if I did not catch the measles from my late adventure,
to make a second visit to the club. No symptoms appearing, I went again; and my reception was
such as led to a third, and a fourth, and a fifth visit, when I became a regular member. I
believe my inducement to this was a certain unintelligible something in three or four of my
new associates, which at once gratified and kept alive my curiosity, in their letting out just
enough of themselves while I was with them to excite me when alone to speculate on what was
kept back. I wondered I had never met with such characters in books; and the kind of interest
they awakened began gradually to widen to others. Henceforth I will live in the world, said
I; 't is my only remedy. A man's own affairs are soon conned; he gets them by heart till they
haunt him when he would be rid of them; but those of another can be known only in part, while
that which remains unrevealed is a never-ending stimulus to curiosity. They is yet.

"" i can'experiment, "i state Godfrey is thither." besides take me

 And the example
is a dangerous one, inasmuch as it comes from men who were not constrained to resort to such
shifts by any poverty of invention.

Akin to this is another and larger kind of borrowing, which, though it cannot strictly be called
copying; yet so evidently betrays a foreign origin, as to produce the same effect. We allude
to the adoption of the peculiar lines, handling, and disposition of masses, &c., of any particular
master.
