THE LADIES OF LLANGOLLEN.

From the early age of Cambrian history, when the peerless beauty of the high-born Myfanwy Fechan
awoke the passion and the poesy of her admiring bard, Howel ap Einion Llygliw, down to the
modern days of the more humble, but not less renowned maiden, "Sweet Jenny Jones;" Llangollen,
"that sweetest of vales," seems to have been associated with recollections of tender and romantic
interest.  Our narrative, however, albeit it relates to the Ladies of Llangollen, refers not
to whispered vows and moonlight serenades between gallant chiefs and damsels of noble birth;
nor to sentimental tales of love in a cottage; but it is rather devoted to the records of a
friendship, whose incidents and eccentricities have engaged the attention of many eminent literati
and tourists.  Most persons who take any interest in the scenery or topography of North Wales,
have either seen or read of that singular residence, Plas Newydd, at Llangollen, for so many
years the home of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby.

About the year 1778, these ladies, impelled by a desire to lead a secluded life of celibacy,
forsook the gay and fashionable circles in which they had moved; and in their search for a
fitting spot, on which to pass their days together in devoted friendship to each other, and
in acts of benevolence and charity to their neighbours, they visited Llangollen. Rambling along
this charming locality one balmy evening, when the tranquil beauty of the lovely valley was
lighted up by the mild splendour of the moon, their eyes rested upon a cottage that stood on
a gentle eminence near the village; and there they resolved to fix their abode. They accordingly
purchased the estate; built a new cottage on the site of the old one, in a remarkably unique
and somewhat grotesque style of architecture; and laid out gardens, pleasure grounds, and rural
walks with grottoes, temples, conservatories, rustic bridges, and other accessories for enjoying,
in the undisturbed quiet of their own domain, the natural charms of their picturesque retreat.
Their mode of life being singular, and their costume still more so (for they assumed a style
of head-dress resembling that of men, and always wore long cloth coats, rather like ladies'
riding habits), they soon attracted the attention of the many travellers who passed through
North Wales; and as they kept up an extensive and active correspondence with several eminent
authors and persons of distinction, the "Ladies of Llangollen," for so they were always designated,
made a much greater sensation in their seclusion, than many less remarkable persons who are
constantly living in the business and bustle of society.  Hence many literary pilgrimages were
made to the recluses of Plas Newydd; and the "even tenor" of their way was often diversified
by the calls of the illustrious, the learned, and the curious; from whom they were as willing
to learn what was passing in politics, literature, and general gossip, as were their visitors
desirous of having a peep within the charmed circle of this mountain solitude. Their motive
for adopting this romantic seclusion is thus stated in "Steward's Collections and Recollections:"--

    "Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby were young ladies of beauty
    and rank, who loved each other with so true an affection, that they
    could never bear the afflicting idea of a separation, which the
    marriage of either might occasion.  They therefore resolved on lives
    of celibacy, and refusing many handsome offers, and remaining deaf to
    the persuasions of their friends, they retired to the beautiful Yale
    of Llangollen, to enjoy the happiness of each other's company, that
    as their friendship began in infancy, it might be perpetuated through
    life.  'Miss Butler and Miss Ponsonby are now
    retired from the society of men into the wilds (!) of Llangollen in
    Wales, where they have resided seventeen years.  Miss Butler is of
    the Ormond family, and had five offers of marriage, all of which she
    rejected.  As Miss Ponsonby, her particular friend and companion, was
    supposed to have been the bar to her matrimonial union, it was
    thought proper to separate them, and Miss Butler was confined.  The
    two ladies, however, found means to elope together, but being soon
    overtaken, were brought back to their respective relations.  Many
    attempts were again made to draw Miss Butler into marriage, though in
    vain; not many weeks after, the ladies eloped again, each having a
    small sum with her. Why should repose i shattered, visiting it is least best than the

  In a letter
addressed to Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby, under date Lichfield, October 4, 1802,
Miss Seward exclaims:--

    "Ah! dearest ladies, it is under the pressure of a severe cold,
    fierce cough, and inflamed lungs, that I address you.  A duty so
    delightful had, but for this incapacitating malady, been earlier
    paid.

    "I have to thank dear Miss Ponsonby for a manuscript of many verses,
    which she had the goodness to make for me in hours so engrossed, amid
    engagements so indispensable.  I had the honour to receive it as I
    was stepping into the chaise which was to convey Mrs. Smith and
    myself far from that Edenic region where we had recently passed so
    many happy hours; from those bowers in Llangollen Vale, whence the
    purest pleasures have so often flowed to my heart and mind, as from a
    full and overflowing fountain."

From Lichfield, Nov. 9, 1802, Miss Seward discourses to Miss Ponsonby on modern tragedy, and
concludes with the following bit of "blue-stocking gossip:"--

    "Though I know her not, I am pleased that Mrs. Spencer has had the
    good fortune to interest and delight you; for I am always desirous
    that men of genius should not do what they are so prone to do, marry
    every-day women.

    "Naughty brook, for having behaved outrageously again!  That little
    stream of the mountain is a true spoiled child, whom we love the
    better for its faults, and for all the trouble and alarm they
    occasion.  You see I presume to involve myself, as if, in some sort,
    the interesting little virago belonged to me.  Certainly it is my
    peculiar pet amongst your scenic children, dear to my taste, as they
    are beautiful; to my heart as being yours."

In a letter from Lichfield, June 13, 1805, Miss Seward begins:--

    "'With a trembling hand, my beloved Miss Ponsonby, do I take up the
    pen to thank you for a thrice kind letter.  It had not remained
    several weeks unacknowledged, but for this terrible malady of the
    head, which has oppressed me with so much severity during the
    interim.  I think it must soon lay me low.  Not at my time of life
    does the constitution, pushed from its equipoise by long enduring
    disease, regain it amid the struggles.

    "Immediately on receiving your last, I sent for Madoc; by far the
    most captivating work of its genuinely inspired author."

In the same letter the following passage occurs:--

    "Our young friend Cary has published his translation of Dante's
    Inferno.  It is thought the best which has appeared, and the sale
    goes on well.  He presents a copy to yourself and Lady Eleanor, and I
    trust you will receive it soon."

After some literary disquisitions on the Inferno, the Lay of the Last Minstrel, and Madoc;
and an allusion to King George's visit to Lichfield, the letter thus concludes:--

    "Present me devoutly to your beloved Lady Eleanor.  Most interesting
    is your description of that visit, mutually paid to that desolate and
    silent Dinbren.  How worthy of yourselves that hour of consecration,
    with all its tributary sighs!  Too happy were the days and weeks
    which I passed beneath its roof, and in its beautiful and sublime
    environs, to permit such revisitation from me.

    "It would break my heart amid its present consciousness, spread over
    with a dark and impervious pall, which can never be drawn away.

    "Dear, and amiable Miss Ponsonby, farewell."

From Lichfield, October 31st, 1805, we have another letter to Miss Ponsonby, with the following
tremendous opening:--

    "Nothing, my dear Madam, is so common as hypocrisy and treachery
    where property is concerned; but a greater excess of them never
    poured their dark currents from the vulgar heart, than in those
    circumstances which your last letter narrates.

    "Thus ever be extortionate villany baffled--and long unclouded be the
    peace which succeeds to that attempted injury.  I cannot express how
    much I am obliged that you took the kind trouble of retracing the
    road of peril, which had so nearly engulfed a scene, whose beauties
    rise perpetually in my sleeping and waking dreams."

What ever could have happened at Plas Newydd to excite so grand a burst of tragic passion:
here is matter for curious speculation!  Then Miss Seward runs into a not very wise dissertation
on politics; then reverts to literary subjects, of which Horace Walpole's genius is the chief
topic; bemoans her own dizziness of the head; has another touch at Mr. Pitt; and finally ejaculates
"Adieu, dearest Madam!  Your beloved Lady Eleanor will accept my affectionate devoirs!"  Why
did not Miss Seward go to Llangollen, to end her days in peace?

In the lively Memoirs of that celebrated Comedian, the late Mr. Charles Matthews, we have the
following humourous letters, descriptive of the "Ladies of Llangollen:"--

                                               "Oswestry, Sept. 4th.  I could scarcely get on for

    many others, which are supplied with the most gratifying conveniences
    for their leisurely inspection.  After all, I must confess, filled as
    was my mind by the impressions of the majestic scenes with which it
    had become familiar, the miniature landscapes supplied by the
    situation of Plas Newydd, fell far short of the anticipation I had
    formed, and they forcibly recalled the emotion I remembered to have
    felt after viewing the mimic hills and vales, and passionless
    cascades of the poet Shenstone, in his retreat at the Leasowes, near
    Hagley."

Miss Costello, who made the tour of North Wales in 1844 is even less complimentary, and is
thus smartly satirical in the peculiarities of the departed "Ladies:"--

    "One of the great attractions of Llangollen a few years ago was the
    romantic story attached to the place and the residence there of Lady
    Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby.  Pilgrimages were made to this
    shrine of friendship, and the ladies were overwhelmed with visitors,
    and their cottage filled with offerings.  Their tomb is now in the
    churchyard, and their cottage let; and very few persons recollect
    much about them, or feel any interest in a sentimental history, which
    belonged to the last century, and now can only excite a smile at the
    eccentricity of its heroines, who, under pretence of retiring from
    society, made themselves conspicuous throughout the country.  Most of
    their accumulated stores were sold by public auction, on the death of
    the last of the friends, and the cottage, as it now stands, is by no
    means either a rural or picturesque object.  It is covered inside and
    out with carved wood, some of value, and some quite worthless; and
    all that remains of the taste of the former proprietors merely proves
    how little was required to please fifty years ago.  The trees,
    planted by the friends, are now grown high, and shut out all view of
    the country; in fact, the whole place has a vulgar, common-place
    appearance, and excited in my mind no sort of interest, nor was my
    indifference agreeably dispelled by the view of an engraving, hung up
    in the little boudoir, representing the two ladies sitting at their
    table covered with curiosities, both dressed in masculine habits, and
    both frightfully ugly.  These portraits, it seems, were taken by an
    amateur, by stealth, as neither of 'The Ladies of Llangollen' would
    consent to sit, and a lamentable record is it which creates most
    unpleasing sensations to the lover of the graceful, beautiful, and
    venerable.

    "The 'ladies' were, although singular in the extreme, remarkably
    charitable and considerate of the necessities of their neighbours,
    and their loss has been greatly felt.  They seemed vain and pompous,
    but accomplished and intellectual, and were a strange compound of
    wisdom and folly, pride and condescension."

The celebrated Madame de Genlis, in an entertaining miscellany, under the title of "Souvenirs
de Felicie L---," has given the following graphic narrative of "The Fair Recluses of Llangollen:"--

    "During my residence in England (says she), nothing struck me so much
    as the delicious cottage of Llangollen, in North Wales.  It is not a
    little extraordinary, that a circumstance so singular and remarkable
    as that connected with this retreat, should hitherto have escaped the
    notice of all modern travellers.  The manner in which I became
    acquainted with it was this:--During our long-stay at Bury, a small
    company of five or six persons, including ourselves, met every
    evening from seven till half-past ten o'clock.  We diverted ourselves
    with music and conversation, so that the time past very agreeably.
    One night friendship happened to be the subject of conversation, and
    I declared that I would with pleasure undertake a long journey to see
    two persons who had long been united by the bonds of genuine
    friendship.  'Well, Madam,' replied Mr. Stuart (now Lord
    Castlereagh), go to Llangollen; you will there see a model of perfect
    friendship, which will afford you the more delight, as it is
    exhibited by two females who are yet young and charming in every
    respect.  Would you like to hear the history of Lady Eleanor Butler
    and Miss Ponsonby?'--'It would give me the greatest pleasure.'--'I
    will relate it to you.'  At these words the company drew nearer to
    Mr. Stuart, we formed a little circle round him, and after
    recollecting himself a few moments, he thus began his narrative:--

    "'Lady Eleanor Butler, was born in Dublin.  She was left an orphan
    while in her cradle; and possessing an ample fortune, together with
    an amiable disposition and a beautiful person, her hand was solicited
    by persons belonging to the first families in Ireland.  At an early
    age she manifested great repugnance to the idea of giving herself a
    master.  This love of independence, which she never dissembled, did
    no injury to her reputation; her conduct has always been
    irreproachable, and no female is more highly distinguished for
    sweetness of temper, modesty, and all the virtues which adorn her
    sex.  In tender infancy a mutual attachment took place between her
    and Miss Ponsonby, by an accident which made a deep impression on
    their imagination.  They had no difficulty to persuade themselves
    that heaven had formed them for each other; that is, that it had
    designed each of them to devote her existence to the other, so that
    they might glide together down the stream of life, in the bosom of
    peace, the most intimate friendship, and delicious independence.
    This idea their sensibility was destined to realize.  Their
    friendship gradually grew stronger with their years, so that at
    seventeen they mutually engaged never to sacrifice their liberty, or
    to part from each other.  From that moment they formed the design of
    withdrawing from the world, and of settling for good in some
    sequestered retreat.  Having heard of the charming scenery of Wales,
    they secretly absconded from their friends for the purpose of fixing
    upon their future residence.  They visited Llangollen, and there, on
    the summit of a mountain, they found a little detached cottage, with
    the situation of which they were delighted.  Here they resolved to
    form their establishment.  Meanwhile the guardians of the young
    fugitives sent people after them, and they were conveyed back to
    Dublin.  They declared that they would return to their mountain as
    soon as they were of age.  Accordingly, at twenty-one, in spite of
    the entreaties and remonstrances of their relatives and friends, they
    quitted Ireland for ever, and flew to Llangollen.  Miss Ponsonby is
    not rich, but Lady Eleanor possesses a considerable fortune.  She
    purchased the little hut and the property of the mountain, where she
    built a cottage, very simple in external appearance, but the interior
    of which displays the greatest elegance.  On the top of the mountain
    she has formed about the house a court and flower-garden; a hedge of
    rosebushes is the only enclosure that surrounds this rural
    habitation.  A convenient carriage-road, the steepness of which has
    been diminished by art, was carried along the mountain.  On the side
    of the latter some ancient pines of prodigious height were preserved;
    fruit trees were planted, and a great quantity of cherry trees in
    particular, which produce the best and finest cherries in England.
    The two friends likewise possess a farm for their cattle, with a
    pretty farm-house and a kitchen-garden at the foot of the mountain.
    In this sequestered abode these two extraordinary persons, with minds
    equally cultivated, and accomplishments equally pleasing, have now
    resided ten years, without ever having been absent from it a single
    night.  Nevertheless they are not unsociable, they sometimes pay
    visits to the neighbouring gentry, and receive with the greatest
    politeness travellers on their way to or from Ireland, who are
    recommended to them by any of their old friends.'

    "This account strongly excited my curiosity, and produced the same
    effect on Mademoiselle d'Orleans and my two young companions.  We
    determined the same night to set out immediately for Llangollen, by
    the circuitous route of Brighton, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight.
    It was the latter end of July when we arrived at Llangollen.  This
    place has not the rich appearance of the English villages in general,
    but nothing can equal the cleanliness of the houses, and among the
    lower classes of any country this is an infallible proof of
    abundance.  Llangollen, surrounded with woods and meadows, clothed
    with the freshest verdure, is situated at the foot of the mountain
    belonging to the two friends, which there forms a majestic pyramid
    covered with trees and flowers.  We arrived at the cottage, the only
    object of our journey, an hour before sunset.

    "The two friends had received in the morning by a messenger the
    letter which Mr. Stuart had given me for them.  We were received with
    a grace, a cordiality, and kindness, of which it would be impossible
    for me to give any idea.  I could not turn my eyes from those two
    ladies, rendered so interesting by their friendship and so
    extraordinary on account of their way of life.  I perceived in them
    none of that vanity which takes delight in the surprize of others.
    Their mutual attachment, and their whole conduct evince such
    simplicity, that astonishment soon gives way to softer emotions; all
    they do and say breathes the utmost frankness and sincerity.  One
    circumstance which I cannot help remarking is, that after living so
    many years in this sequestered retreat, they speak French with equal
    fluency and purity.  I was likewise much struck with the little
    resemblance there is between them.  Lady Eleanor has a charming face,
    embellished with the glow of health; her whole appearance and manner
    announce vivacity and the most unaffected gaiety.  Miss Ponsonby has
    a fine countenance, but pale and melancholy.  One seems to have been
    born in this solitude, so perfectly is she at her ease in it; for her
    easy carriage shews that she has not retained the slightest
    recollection of the world and its vain pleasures.  The other, silent
    and pensive, has too much candour and innocence for you to suppose
    that repentance has conducted her into solitude, but you would
    suppose that she still cherishes some painful regrets.  Both have the
    most engaging politeness, and highly-cultivated minds.  An excellent
    library, composed of the best English, French, and Italian authors,
    affords them an inexhaustible source of diversified amusement and
    solid occupation; for reading is not truly profitable except when a
    person has time to read again.

    "The interior of the house is delightful on account of the just
    proportion and distribution of the apartments, the elegance of the
    ornaments and furniture, and the admirable view which you enjoy from
    all the windows; the drawing-room is adorned with charming
    landscapes, drawn and coloured from nature, by Miss Ponsonby.  Lady
    Eleanor is a great proficient in music; and their solitary habitation
    is filled with embroidery by them both, of wonderful execution.  Miss
    Ponsonby, who writes the finest hand I ever saw, has copied a number
    of select pieces in verse and prose, which she has ornamented with
    vignettes and arabesques, in the best taste, and which form a most
    valuable collection.  Thus the arts are cultivated there with equal
    modesty and success, and their productions are admired with a feeling
    that is not experienced elsewhere; the spectator observes with
    delight that so much merit is secure in this peaceful retreat from
    the shafts of satire and envy, and that talents unaccompanied with
    ostentation and pride, have there never coveted any suffrages but
    those of friendship.

    "This evening was a scene of enchantment for me; not one painful
    reflection disturbed its felicity.  I retired to rest, but my
    imagination was so fully occupied with what I had seen and heard,
    that my thoughts kept me for a long time awake.  At length, I was
    just falling asleep, when I was roused by the most melodious sounds.
    I listened in great astonishment; it was not music, but an indistinct
    and celestial harmony which penetrated my very soul.  I discovered
    that it was produced by a violent wind which had just then arisen; my
    ear distinguished the distant noise and the whistling usually heard
    on such occasions, but the winds changing their nature as they
    approached this asylum of peace and friendship, formed only the most
    enchanting harmony as they met its trees and its walls.  I was
    strongly disposed to believe in prodigies; but nevertheless I was
    determined to investigate the nature of this, but I durst not rise
    for fear of waking Mademoiselle d'Orleans, who was extremely fatigued
    with her journey, and slept in a bed close by mine.  The tempest
    suddenly ceased, and the harmonious sounds appeared to be carried to
    a distance by the retiring winds.  I raised my head towards the
    heavens to catch the last tones of this celestial concert, which
    seemed to be lost in the clouds.  I listened with transport like St.
    Cecilia; if I had had my harp in my hands I should certainly have
    dropped it; at that moment all terrestrial music appeared totally
    spiritless and insipid.

    "Next morning the whole mystery was explained.  On opening my window
    I found in the balcony an Eolian harp, an instrument with which I was
    then unacquainted, and which, when the wind blows upon it, produces
    such enchanting sounds.

    "I walked out the whole forenoon with the two friends; nothing can
    equal the charms of the surrounding scenery, and of the prospects
    which the mountain whose summit they occupy commands; at this
    elevation they appear the queens of all the beautiful country at
    their feet.  Towards the north they have a view of the village and of
    a wood; to the south a long river washes the foot of the mountain,
    and fertilizes meadows of prodigious extent, beyond which is
    discovered an amphitheatre of hills, covered with intermingled trees
    and rocks.  In the midst of this wild scenery rises a majestic tower,
    which might be taken for the Pharos of this coast, but is only the
    ruins of a magnificent castle, once the residence of the prince of
    the country. I take round one, they appear at it was, it had done
    the charm, it produced it was to lose me says

  It was erected by Cyngen ab Cadell Dryrnllug, in memory of his great grandfather
Eliseg, whose son Brochmail Ysgythrog, grandfather of the founder of this rude monument of
filial veneration, was engaged in the memorable border wars at the close of the sixth century;
and was defeated at the Battle of Chester, A.D. 607.  During the great rebellion this pillar
was thrown down by Oliver Cromwell's "Reformers," who in their fiery zeal for destruction mistook
it for a "Popish Cross;" and it remained for more than a century in its broken recumbent condition,
when it was restored by the patriotism and intelligence of Mr. Lloyd of Trevor Hall, and replaced
upon its pedestal with a suitable memorial to record the fact.  It now forms an interesting
relic of antiquity, and is probably the oldest British Cross (bearing a carved inscription)
which exists in these islands.  That said inscription has long been a puzzle to the learned
investigator of archaeological remains.

Having wandered through the verdant meads of the "happy valley," the adventurous tourist may
probably wish to climb the lofty hill, which is crowned by the romantic ruins of the Castle
of Dinas Bran.  This memorable fortress of the past, is a remarkable object from all parts
of the vale; for whose safety and defence it was long the abode of a line of chiefs renowned
in Cambrian lore.  The view from the summit is exceedingly picturesque, grand, and imposing;
and naturally prompts the exclamation of the Poet of the Seasons--

    "Heavens! what a goodly prospect spreads around."

On descending the mountain-path, the traveller may perchance look round for a comfortable resting-place
and good refreshment; he will readily find both, either at the Hand, or the King's Head Hotel.
In the album of the latter house of entertainment he may also peruse the following bacchanalian
effusion in honour of "Llangollen Ale," which he will then be in the mood to enjoy; and as
he quaffs this nectar of the valley, he may thus chaunt its praises, if in a convivial humour,
to the music of a Welsh harp--

LLANGOLLEN ALE.

While other poets loudly rant
   About Llangollen's Vale,
Let me, with better taste, descant
   Upon Llangollen Ale.

The daughters of the place are fair,
   Its sons are strong and hale:
What makes them so?  Llangollen air?
   No, no!--Llangollen Ale.

And Nature only beautified
   The landscape, to prevail
On travellers to turn aside
   And quaff Llangollen Ale.

For though the scene might please at first
   As charms would quickly stale;
While he who tastes will ever thirst
   To drink Llangollen Ale.

From rock to rock the Dee may roam,
   And chafe without avail;
It cannot match its yeasty foam
   Against Llangollen Ale.

The umber-tinted trees that crown
   Bron-vawr's ridge are pale,
Contrasted with the nutty brown
   That tints Llangollen Ale.

Nor is the keep of Dinas-bran,
   Though high and hard to scale,
So elevated as the man
   Who drinks Llangollen Ale.

Thy shattered arch, beside the way,
   Val-crucis, tells a tale
Of monks who sometimes went astray
   To quaff Llangollen Ale.

And still upon the saintly spot
   The pilgrim may regale
His fainting spirits with a pot
   Of good Llangollen Ale.

For though the ancient portress may
   Not offer it for sale,
Yet cheerfully to all who pay
   She gives Llangollen Ale.

And, Eliseg, thy pillar rude
   Is merely--I'll be bail--
A monument to him who brewed
   The first Llangollen Ale.

In short, each ruin, stream, or tree,
   Within Llangollen's Vale,
Where'er I turn, whate'er I see,
   Is redolent of Ale.

                                                       Liverpool.  R. R.

The convivial disposition of the monks of the "olden time" has always been a favourite theme
with our romance writers and "ballad-mongers;" but it would appear from a passage which Mr.
Roscoe quotes, that the cowled brethren of Valle Crucis Abbey did not content themselves in
their hours of festivity with draughts of "Llangollen Ale."  The wealth of the institution,
he infers, may be judged of by the magnificent hospitality of the monks, who are described
by Owain as having the table usually covered with four courses of meat, served up in silver
dishes, with sparkling claret for their general beverage.

    "Many have told of the monks of old,
       What a saintly race they were;
    But 'tis most true, that a merrier crew
       Could scarce be found elsewhere;
          For they sung and laughed,
          And the rich wine quaffed,
       And lived on the daintiest cheer.

    "And the Abbot meek, with his form so sleek,
       Was the heartiest of them all,
    And would take his place, with a smiling face,
       When the refection bell would call;
          And they sung and laughed,
          And the rich wine quaffed,
       Till they shook the olden hall."
