THE CRIMSON FAIRY BOOK

By Various

Edited by Andrew Lang

Preface

Each Fairy Book demands a preface from the Editor, and these introductions are inevitably both
monotonous and unavailing. A sense of literary honesty compels the Editor to keep repeating
that he is the Editor, and not the author of the Fairy Tales, just as a distinguished man of
science is only the Editor, not the Author of Nature. Like nature, popular tales are too vast
to be the creation of a single modern mind. The Editor's business is to hunt for collections
of these stories told by peasant or savage grandmothers in many climes, from New Caledonia
to Zululand; from the frozen snows of the Polar regions to Greece, or Spain, or Italy, or far
Lochaber. When the tales are found they are adapted to the needs of British children by various
hands, the Editor doing little beyond guarding the interests of propriety, and toning down
to mild reproofs the tortures inflicted on wicked stepmothers, and other naughty characters.

These explanations have frequently been offered already; but, as far as ladies and children
are concerned, to no purpose. They still ask the Editor how he can invent so many stories--more
than Shakespeare, Dumas, and Charles Dickens could have invented in a century. And the Editor
still avers, in Prefaces, that he did not invent one of the stories; that nobody knows, as
a rule, who invented them, or where, or when. It is only plain that, perhaps a hundred thousand
years ago, some savage grandmother told a tale to a savage granddaughter; that the granddaughter
told it in her turn; that various tellers made changes to suit their taste, adding or omitting
features and incidents; that, as the world grew civilised, other alterations were made, and
that, at last, Homer composed the 'Odyssey,' and somebody else composed the Story of Jason
and the Fleece of Gold, and the enchantress Medea, out of a set of wandering popular tales,
which are still told among Samoyeds and Samoans, Hindoos and Japanese.

All this has been known to the wise and learned for centuries, and especially since the brothers
Grimm wrote in the early years of the Nineteenth Century. But children remain unaware of the
facts, and so do their dear mothers; whence the Editor infers that they do not read his prefaces,
and are not members of the Folk Lore Society, or students of Herr Kohler and M. Cosquin, and
M. Henri Guidoz and Professor Child, and Mr. Max Muller. Though these explanations are not
attended to by the Editor's customers, he makes them once more, for the relief of his conscience.
Many tales in this book are translated, or adapted, from those told by mothers and nurses in
Hungary; others are familiar to Russian nurseries; the Servians are responsible for some; a
rather peculiarly fanciful set of stories are adapted from the Roumanians; others are from
the Baltic shores; others from sunny Sicily; a few are from Finland, and Iceland, and Japan,
and Tunis, and Portugal. No doubt many children will like to look out these places on the map,
and study their mountains, rivers, soil, products, and fiscal policies, in the geography books.
The peoples who tell the stories differ in colour; language, religion, and almost everything
else; but they all love a nursery tale. The stories have mainly been adapted or translated
by Mrs. Lang, a few by Miss Lang and Miss Blackley.

Lovely Ilonka

There was once a king's son who told his father that he wished to marry.

'No, no!' said the king; 'you must not be in such a hurry. Wait till you have done some great
deed. My father did not let me marry till I had won the golden sword you see me wear.'

The prince was much disappointed, but he never dreamed of disobeying his father, and he began
to think with all his might what he could do. It was no use staying at home, so one day he
wandered out into the world to try his luck, and as he walked along he came to a little hut
in which he found an old woman crouching over the fire.

'Good evening, mother. I see you have lived long in this world; do you know anything about
the three bulrushes?'

'Yes, indeed, I've lived long and been much about in the world, but I have never seen or heard
anything of what you ask. Still, if you will wait till to-morrow I may be able to tell you
something.'

Well, he waited till the morning, and quite early the old woman appeared and took out a little
pipe and blew in it, and in a moment all the crows in the world were flying about her. Not
one was missing. Then she asked if they knew anything about the three bulrushes, but not one
of them did.

The prince went on his way, and a little further on he found another hut in which lived an
old man. On being questioned the old man said he knew nothing, but begged the prince to stay
overnight, and the next morning the old man called all the ravens together, but they too had
nothing to tell.

The prince bade him farewell and set out. He wandered so far that he crossed seven kingdoms,
and at last, one evening, he came to a little house in which was an old woman.

'Good evening, dear mother,' said he politely.

'Good evening to you, my dear son,' answered the old woman. 'It is lucky for you that you spoke
to me or you would have met with a horrible death. But may I ask where are you going?'

'I am seeking the three bulrushes. Do you know anything about them?'

'I don't know anything myself, but wait till to-morrow. Perhaps I can tell you then.' So the
next morning she blew on her pipe, and lo! and behold every magpie in the world flew up. That
is to say, all the magpies except one who had broken a leg and a wing. The old woman sent after
it at once, and when she questioned the magpies the crippled one was the only one who knew
where the three bulrushes were.

Then the prince started off with the lame magpie. They went on and on till they reached a great
stone wall, many, many feet high.

'Now, prince,' said the magpie, 'the three bulrushes are behind that wall.'

The prince wasted no time. He set his horse at the wall and leaped over it. Then he looked
about for the three bulrushes, pulled them up and set off with them on his way home. As he
rode along one of the bulrushes happened to knock against something. It split open and, only
think! out sprang a lovely girl, who said: 'My heart's love, you are mine and I am yours; do
give me a glass of water.'

But how could the prince give it her when there was no water at hand? So the lovely maiden
flew away. He split the second bulrush as an experiment and just the same thing happened.

How careful he was of the third bulrush! He waited till he came to a well, and there he split
it open, and out sprang a maiden seven times lovelier than either of the others, and she too
said: 'My heart's love, I am yours and you are mine; do give me a glass of water.'

This time the water was ready and the girl did not fly away, but she and the prince promised
to love each other always. Then they set out for home.

They soon reached the prince's country, and as he wished to bring his promised bride back in
a fine coach he went on to the town to fetch one. In the field where the well was, the king's
swineherds and cowherds were feeding their droves, and the prince left Ilonka (for that was
her name) in their care.

Unluckily the chief swineherd had an ugly old daughter, and whilst the prince was away he dressed
her up in fine clothes, and threw Ilonka into the well.

The prince returned before long, bringing with him his father and mother and a great train
of courtiers to escort Ilonka home. But how they all stared when they saw the swineherd's ugly
daughter! However, there was nothing for it but to take her home; and, two days later, the
prince married her, and his father gave up the crown to him.

But he had no peace! He knew very well he had been cheated, though he could not think how.
Once he desired to have some water brought him from the well into which Ilonka had been thrown.
The coachman went for it and, in the bucket he pulled up, a pretty little duck was swimming.
He looked wonderingly at it, and all of a sudden it disappeared and he found a dirty looking
girl standing near him. The girl returned with him and managed to get a place as housemaid
in the palace.

Of course she was very busy all day long, but whenever she had a little spare time she sat
down to spin. Her distaff turned of itself and her spindle span by itself and the flax wound
itself off; and however much she might use there was always plenty left.

When the queen--or, rather, the swineherd's daughter--heard of this, she very much wished to
have the distaff, but the girl flatly refused to give it to her. However, at last she consented
on condition that she might sleep one night in the king's room. The queen was very angry, and
scolded her well; but as she longed to have the distaff she consented, though she gave the
king a sleeping draught at supper.

Then the girl went to the king's room looking seven times lovelier than ever. She bent over
the sleeper and said: 'My heart's love, I am yours and you are mine. Speak to me but once;
I am your Ilonka.' But the king was so sound asleep he neither heard nor spoke, and Ilonka
left the room, sadly thinking he was ashamed to own her.

Soon after the queen again sent to say that she wanted to buy the spindle. The girl agreed
to let her have it on the same conditions as before; but this time, also, the queen took care
to give the king a sleeping draught. And once more Ilonka went to the king's room and spoke
to him; whisper as sweetly as she might she could get no answer.

Now some of the king's servants had taken note of the matter, and warned their master not to
eat and drink anything that the queen offered him, as for two nights running she had given
him a sleeping draught. The queen had no idea that her doings had been discovered; and when,
a few days later, she wanted the flax, and had to pay the same price for it, she felt no fears
at all.

At supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things to eat and drink,
but he declared he was not hungry, and went early to bed.

The queen repented bitterly her promise to the girl, but it was too late to recall it; for
Ilonka had already entered the king's room, where he lay anxiously waiting for something, he
knew not what. All of a sudden he saw a lovely maiden who bent over him and said: 'My dearest
love, I am yours and you are mine. Speak to me, for I am your Ilonka.'

At these words the king's heart bounded within him. He sprang up and embraced and kissed her,
and she told him all her adventures since the moment he had left her. And when he heard all
that Ilonka had suffered, and how he had been deceived, he vowed he would be revenged; so he
gave orders that the swineherd, his wife and daughter should all be hanged; and so they were.

The next day the king was married, with great rejoicings, to the fair Ilonka; and if they are
not yet dead--why, they are still living.

Lucky Luck

Once upon a time there was a king who had an only son. When the lad was about eighteen years
old his father had to go to fight in a war against a neighbouring country, and the king led
his troops in person. He bade his son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account
to marry till his return.

Time went by. The prince ruled the country and never even thought of marrying. But when he
reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to think that it might be rather nice to have a
wife, and he thought so much that at last he got quite eager about it. He remembered, however,
what his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it was ten years since
the king went out to war. Then the prince called his courtiers about him and set off with a
great retinue to seek a bride. He hardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty
days, when, suddenly, he found himself in his father's camp.

The king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions to ask and answer; but
when he heard that instead of quietly waiting for him at home the prince was starting off to
seek a wife he was very angry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave
any of my people with you.'

Only one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part from him. They journeyed
over hill and dale till they came to a place called Goldtown. The King of Goldtown had a lovely
daughter, and the prince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her.

He was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had charming manners, so
he lost no time in asking for her hand and her parents gave her to him with joy. The wedding
took place at once, and the feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month. At the end of
the month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they spent the first evening
at an inn. Everyone in the house slept, and only the faithful servant kept watch. About midnight
he heard three crows, who had flown to the roof, talking together.

'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight. It seems quite a pity they should lose
their lives so soon.'

'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the bridge over the Gold
Stream will break just as they are driving over it. But, listen! whoever overhears and tells
what we have said will be turned to stone up to his knees.'

The crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon them followed three pigeons.

'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will perish,' said they; 'for
the king is going to send a carriage to meet them which looks as new as paint. But when they
are seated in it a raging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds. Then
it will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed. But anyone who hears and betrays what
we have said will be turned to stone up to his waist.'

With that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and this is what they said:

'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge and the carriage, the
king means to send them each a splendid gold embroidered robe. When they put these on they
will be burnt up at once. But whoever hears and repeats this will turn to stone from head to foot.'

Early next morning the travellers got up and breakfasted. They began to tell each other their
dreams. At last the servant said:

'Gracious prince, I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all I asked we should get
home safe and sound; but if you did not we should certainly be lost. My dreams never deceive
me, so I entreat you to follow my advice during the rest of the journey.'

'Don't make such a fuss about a dream,' said the prince; 'dreams are but clouds. Still, to
prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you wish.'

With that they set out on their journey.

At midday they reached the Gold Stream. When they got to the bridge the servant said: 'Let
us leave the carriage here, my prince, and walk a little way. The town is not far off and we
can easily get another carriage there, for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold
out much longer.'

The prince looked well at the carriage. He did not think it looked so unsafe as his servant
said; but he had given his word and he held to it.

They got down and loaded the horses with the luggage. The prince and his bride walked over
the bridge, but the servant said he would ride the horses through the stream so as to water
and bathe them.

They reached the other side without harm, and bought a new carriage in the town, which was
quite near, and set off once more on their travels; but they had not gone far when they met
a messenger from the king who said to the prince: 'His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness
this beautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own country and amongst
your own people.'

The prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant said: 'My lord, let me
examine this carriage first and then you can get in if I find it is all right; otherwise we
had better stay in our own.'

The prince made no objections, and after looking the carriage well over the servant said: 'It
is as bad as it is smart'; and with that he knocked it all to pieces, and they went on in the
one that they had bought.

At last they reached the frontier; there another messenger was waiting for them, who said that
the king had sent two splendid robes for the prince and his bride, and begged that they would
wear them for their state entry. But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do
with them, and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to destroy the robes.

The old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed; that his son still lived
and that he would have to give up the crown to him now he was married, for that was the law
of the land. He longed to know how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed
rejoice to have you safely back, but I cannot imagine why the beautiful carriage and the splendid
robes I sent did not please you; why you had them destroyed.'

'Indeed, sire,' said the prince, 'I was myself much annoyed at their destruction; but my servant
had begged to direct everything on the journey and I had promised him that he should do so.
He declared that we could not possibly get home safely unless I did as he told me.'

The old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together and condemned the
servant to death.

The gallows was put up in the square in front of the palace. The servant was led out and his
sentence read to him.

The rope was being placed round his neck, when he begged to be allowed a few last words. 'On
our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first night at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch
all night.' And then he went on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned
to stone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had proved his innocence.
But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the time his story was done he had turned to stone
from head to foot.

Oh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what pained him most was the
thought that he was lost through his very faithfulness, and he determined to travel all over
the world and never rest till he found some means of restoring him to life.

Now there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse. To her he confided all
his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in her care. 'You have a long way before you, my
son,' said the old woman; 'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot
help you no one on earth can.'

So the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked till he got beyond his
own country, and he wandered through a wood for three days but did not meet a living being
in it. At the end of the third day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he
spent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him: 'My gracious lord,
where are you going all alone?'

And the prince told him.

'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it that though I have an
excellent mill, with all its machinery complete, and get plenty of grain to grind, I am so
poor that I hardly know how to live from one day to another?'

The prince promised to inquire, and went on his way. He wandered about for three days more,
and at the end of the third day saw a little town. It was quite late when he reached it, but
he could discover no light anywhere, and walked almost right through it without finding a house
where he could turn in. But far away at the end of the town he saw a light in a window. He
went straight to it and in the house were three girls playing a game together. The prince asked
for a night's lodging and they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,
where he slept.

Next morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he told them his story.
'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky Luck how it happens that here we are over
thirty years old and no lover has come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'

The prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.

Then he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to night and from night
to morning before he got near the other end. Here he found a pretty stream which was different
from other streams as, instead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell
me what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a hundred years and more
and no one has ever yet come by.'

'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so that I may walk through.'

The stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting his feet; and directly
he got to the other side he told his story as he had promised.

'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a clear, bright, rapid stream
I never have a fish or any other living creature in my waters.'

The prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.

When he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely valley till he reached
a little house thatched with rushes, and he went in to rest for he was very tired.

Everything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful honest-looking old woman
was sitting by the fire.

'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.

'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'

'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.

'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He is not at home just
now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go too. Here are two spades. When you find him
begin to dig, but don't speak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to
eat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will question you, and then
tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer whatever you may ask.'

With that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as she had told him. After
dinner they lay down to rest.

All of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort of man are you, for
since you came here you have not spoken a word?'

'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince whose faithful servant
has been turned to stone, and I want to know how to help him.'

'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you get home your wife will
just have had a little boy. Take three drops of blood from the child's little finger, rub them
on your servant's wrists with a blade of grass and he will return to life.'

'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him. 'In the forest near
here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living creature in it. Why is this?'

'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in crossing, to get as
near the other side as you can before you say so, or you may be the first victim yourself.'

'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged one night in the house of three
maidens. All were well-mannered, hard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why
was this?'

'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'

'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best machinery and gets plenty
of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly live from day to day?'

'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to those who need it.'

The prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly leave of Lucky Luck, and
set off for home.

When he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news. 'When I get across I will
tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he walked through and on to the highest part of the
bank. He stopped and shouted out:

'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living creature in your waters
until someone is drowned in you.'

The words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and overflowed till it reached
the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed so far up it that the spray flew over him. But
he clung on tight, and after failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper
course. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set out on his march home.

He spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer, and by-and-by he told
the three sisters not to throw out all their sweepings in the face of the sun.

The prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford the stream with a fine
horse they had stolen. When they were half-way across, the stream rose so suddenly that it
swept them all away. From that time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.

The miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in time grew so rich that
he hardly knew how much he had.

And the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had each a wooer within a week.

When the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine little boy. He did not
lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till the blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists
of the stone figure, which shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and
there was the faithful servant alive and well.

When the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about, flung himself on the ground
and died.

The servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully all the rest of his life;
and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving him still.

[From Ungarische Mahrchen.]

The Hairy Man

Somewhere or other, but I don't know where, there lived a king who owned two remarkably fine
fields of rape, but every night two of the rape heaps were burnt down in one of the fields.
The king was extremely angry at this, and sent out soldiers to catch whoever had set fire to
the ricks; but it was all of no use--not a soul could they see. Then he offered nine hundred
crowns to anyone who caught the evil-doer, and at the same time ordered that whoever did not
keep proper watch over the fields should be killed; but though there were a great many people,
none seemed able to protect the fields.

The king had already put ninety-nine people to death, when a little swineherd came to him who
had two dogs; one was called 'Psst,' and the other 'Hush'; and the boy told the king that he
would watch over the ricks.

When it grew dark he climbed up on the top of the fourth rick, from where he could see the
whole field. About eleven o'clock he thought he saw someone going to a rick and putting a light
to it. 'Just you wait,' thought he, and called out to his dogs: 'Hi! Psst, Hush, catch him!'
But Psst and Hush had not waited for orders, and in five minutes the man was caught.

Next morning he was brought bound before the king, who was so pleased with the boy that he
gave him a thousand crowns at once. The prisoner was all covered with hair, almost like an
animal; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong
room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come
and see this wonder.

That was all very well; but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went to look at
the hairy man also, and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him.
He stole the key of the strong room from his mother and opened the door. Then he took the key
back, but the hairy man escaped and went off into the world.

Then the kings and princes began to arrive one after another, and all were most anxious to
see the hairy man; but he was gone! The king nearly burst with rage and with the shame he felt.
He questioned his wife sharply, and told her that if she could not find and bring back the
hairy man he would put her in a hut made of rushes and burn her there. The queen declared she
had had nothing to do with the matter; if her son had happened to take the key it had not been
with her knowledge.

So they fetched the little prince and asked him all sorts of questions, and at last he owned
that he had let the hairy man out. The king ordered his servants to take the boy into the forest
and to kill him there, and to bring back part of his liver and lungs.

There was grief all over the palace when the king's command was known, for he was a great favourite.
But there was no help for it, and they took the boy out into the forest. But the man was sorry
for him, and shot a dog and carried pieces of his lungs and liver to the king, who was satisfied,
and did not trouble himself any more.

The prince wandered about in the forest and lived as best he could for five years. One day
he came upon a poor little cottage in which was an old man. They began to talk, and the prince
told his story and sad fate. Then they recognised each other, for the old fellow was no other
than the hairy man whom the prince had set free, and who had lived ever since in the forest.

The prince stayed here for two years; then he wished to go further. The old man begged him
hard to stay, but he would not, so his hairy friend gave him a golden apple out of which came
a horse with a golden mane, and a golden staff with which to guide the horse. The old man also
gave him a silver apple out of which came the most beautiful hussars and a silver staff; and
a copper apple from which he could draw as many foot soldiers as ever he wished, and a copper
staff. He made the prince swear solemnly to take the greatest care of these presents, and then
he let him go.

The boy wandered on and on till he came to a large town. Here he took service in the king's
palace, and as no one troubled themselves about him he lived quietly on.

One day news was brought to the king that he must go out to war. He was horribly frightened
for he had a very small army, but he had to go all the same.

When they had all left, the prince said to the housekeeper:

'Give me leave to go to the next village--I owe a small bill there, and I want to go and pay
it'; and as there was nothing to be done in the palace the housekeeper gave him leave.

When he got beyond the town he took out his golden apple, and when the horse sprang out he
swung himself into the saddle. Then he took the silver and the copper apples, and with all
these fine soldiers he joined the king's army.

The king saw them approach with fear in his heart, for he did not know if it might not be an
enemy; but the prince rode up, and bowed low before him. 'I bring your Majesty reinforcements,'
said he.

The king was delighted, and all dread of his enemy at once disappeared. The princesses were
there too, and they were very friendly with the prince and begged him to get into their carriage
so as to talk to them. But he declined, and remained on horseback, as he did not know at what
moment the battle might begin; and whilst they were all talking together the youngest princess,
who was also the loveliest, took off her ring, and her sister tore her handkerchief in two
pieces, and they gave these gifts to the prince.

Suddenly the enemy came in sight. The king asked whether his army or the prince's should lead
the way; but the prince set off first and with his hussars he fought so bravely that only two
of the enemy were left alive, and these two were only spared to act as messengers.

The king was overjoyed and so were his daughters at this brilliant victory. As they drove home
they begged the prince to join them, but he would not come, and galloped off with his hussars.

When he got near the town he packed his soldiers and his fine horse all carefully into the
apple again, and then strolled into the town. On his return to the palace he was well scolded
by the housekeeper for staying away so long.

Well, the whole matter might have ended there; but it so happened that the younger princess
had fallen in love with the prince, as he had with her. And as he had no jewels with him, he
gave her the copper apple and staff.

One day, as the princesses were talking with their father, the younger one asked him whether
it might not have been their servant who had helped him so much. The king was quite angry at
the idea; but, to satisfy her, he ordered the servant's room to be searched. And there, to
everyone's surprise, they found the golden ring and the half of the handkerchief. When these
were brought to the king he sent for the prince at once and asked if it had been he who had
come to their rescue.

'Yes, your Majesty, it was I,' answered the prince.

'But where did you get your army?'

'If you wish to see it, I can show it you outside the city walls.'

And so he did; but first he asked for the copper apple from the younger princess, and when
all the soldiers were drawn up there were such numbers that there was barely room for them.

The king gave him his daughter and kingdom as a reward for his aid, and when he heard that
the prince was himself a king's son his joy knew no bounds. The prince packed all his soldiers
carefully up once more, and they went back into the town.

Not long after there was a grand wedding; perhaps they may all be alive still, but I don't know.

To Your Good Health!

[From Russische Mahrchen.]

The Story of the Seven Simons

Far, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there stood a splendid city
where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he was rich and handsome. His great army was
made up of men ready to obey his slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in
each city he had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows. His council
consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose long beards flowed down over their
breasts, each of whom was as learned as a whole college. This council always told the king
the exact truth.

Now the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy anything because he could
not find a bride to his mind.

One day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed into the harbour and
several merchants came on shore. Said the king to himself: 'These people have travelled far
and beheld many lands. I will ask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and
as handsome as I am.'

So he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came he said: 'You have
travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to ask you a question, and I beg you to answer
truthfully.

'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king, or a prince, who is as
clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be worthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'

The merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said: 'I have heard that
across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a mighty king, whose daughter, the Princess
Helena, is so lovely that she can certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever
that the wisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'

'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'

'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and we do not know the
way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The princess is no bride for you.'

'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.

'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you send an envoy to the
island he will take ten years to get there and ten more to return--twenty years in all. Will
not the princess have grown old in that time and have lost all her beauty?'

The king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them leave to trade in his
country without paying any duties, and dismissed them.

After they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled and anxious; so he
decided to ride into the country to distract his mind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers.
The huntsmen blew their horns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they
all set out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other side of the hedge
stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye could reach, and the yellow ears swayed
to and fro in the gentle breeze like a rippling sea of gold.

The king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he, 'whoever dug and planted
it must be good workmen. If all the fields in my kingdom were as well cared for as this, there
would be more bread than my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field belonged.

Off rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a nice, tidy farmhouse, in
front of which sat seven peasants, lunching on rye bread and drinking water. They wore red
shirts bound with gold braid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from another.

The messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the seven brothers answered:
'The field is ours.'

'And who are you?'

'We are King Archidej's labourers.'

These answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to be brought before him
at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest said, bowing low:

'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and mother, and we all have
the same name, for each of us is called Simon. Our father taught us to be true to our king,
and to till the ground, and to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different
trade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect our mother earth,
which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'

The king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done well, good people, in
planting your field, and now you have a golden harvest. But I should like each of you to tell
me what special trades your father taught you.'

'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you will give me some workmen
and materials I will build you a great white pillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'

'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your trade?'

'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has built the pillar I can
mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds, I can see what is happening: in every country
under the sun.'

'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'

'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men, with all sorts of
new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will build you quite a simple boat--one, two,
three, and it's done! But my plain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where
other ships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would require ten years
mine will do the distance in a week.'

'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'

'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build you a ship, then let
me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an enemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink
it to the bottom of the sea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'

'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon the fifth do?'

'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy and I will make you
a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the sky nor the wild beast in the forest is
safe. The bolt hits whatever the eye sees.'

'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth, tell me your trade.'

'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother hits any creature I
catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into the water I pick it up out of the greatest
depths, and if it is in a dark forest I can find it even at midnight.'

The king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers, and said: 'Thank you,
good people; your father did well to teach you all these things. Now follow me to the town,
as I want to see what you can do. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time
comes I will send you home with royal presents.'

The brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king remembered that he had
not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to him and said: 'Why are you silent? What is
your handicraft?'

And the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have learnt nothing. I could
not manage it. And if I do know how to do anything it is not what might properly be called
a real trade--it is rather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king
himself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of mine would please your
Majesty.'

'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this trade?'

'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I have told you. Then
you shall hear.'

'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'

Then the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and said: 'My trade, King
Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who follows it in your kingdom generally loses his
life and has no hopes of pardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to
steal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not the deepest vault, even
if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my stealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'

When the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon you, you rascal,' he cried;
'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on bread and water till you have forgotten such a
trade. Indeed, it would be better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'

'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I chosen, I could have
robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges to let me off, and built a white marble
palace with what was left. But though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked
me my trade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'

'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from this hour you shall
be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away with him to the prison. But you six Simons
follow me and be assured of my royal favour.'

So the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the guards, who put him
in chains and threw him in prison with only bread and water for food. Next day the king gave
the first Simon carpenters, masons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar,
and the like, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar far, far up into
the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other stars were higher still.

Then the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that was going on through
the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts of wonderful things to tell. How one king
was marching in battle against another, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another
place, great rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of famine. In fact
there was not the smallest event going on over the earth that was hidden from him.

Next the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice, thrice, and the wonder-ship
was ready. At a sign from the king it was launched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird
on the waves. Instead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them with
fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the fourth Simon seized the prow
with his strong hand, and in a moment it was gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed,
and then the ship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he brought
a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.

Whilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and hammered out his iron, and
when the king returned from the harbour the magic cross-bow was made.

His Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky and saw, far, far away,
an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking like a little speck.

'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'

Simon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the eagle fell. As it was
falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught the bird before it fell to earth and brought
it to the king.

'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is indeed a master of
his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest and have your dinner.'

The six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun before a messenger came
to say that the king wanted to see them. They obeyed at once and found him surrounded by all
his court and men of state.

'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear what my wise counsellors
have thought of. As you, Simon the second, can see the whole world from the top of the great
pillar, I want you to climb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many
seas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter of the king is the
beautiful Princess Helena.'

Off ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed around, listened on
all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.

'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan. The king is a mighty
monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He sits on his throne and declares that no prince
or king on earth is good enough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and
that if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and destroy his kingdom.'

'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his country far off?'

'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten years in fair weather
to sail there. But if the weather were stormy we might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed.
It is not so very large--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights. Besides
these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen. Altogether you may say another
hundred thousand, and there is a picked body of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions
requiring particular courage.'

The king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the nobles and courtiers standing
round: 'I am determined to marry the Princess Helena, but how shall I do it?'

The nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide behind each other. Then
the third Simon said:

'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the Island of Busan? What
can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a week instead of in ten years. But ask your
council to advise you what to do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess
peacefully or by war?'

But the wise men were as silent as ever.

The king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court Fool pushed his way
to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you clever people so puzzled about? The matter
is quite clear. As it seems it will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh
Simon? That i had yield him asked a pot and the reciprocation in that horse which i informed him should

 So he commanded his
servants to take him away and not to let him enter the palace again until he had come to his
right senses.

The sword clanked loudly as the boy was led away, but the child said nothing, though he was
very unhappy at being treated so badly when he had done nothing. However, the servants were
very kind to him, and their children brought him fruit and all sorts of nice things, and he
soon grew merry again, and lived amongst them for many years till his seventeenth birthday.

Meanwhile the two eldest princesses had become women, and had married two powerful kings who
ruled over great countries across the sea. The youngest one was old enough to be married too,
but she was very particular, and turned up her nose at all the young princes who had sought
her hand.

One day she was sitting in the palace feeling rather dull and lonely, and suddenly she began
to wonder what the servants were doing, and whether it was not more amusing down in their quarters.
The king was at his council and the queen was ill in bed, so there was no one to stop the princess,
and she hastily ran across the gardens to the houses where the servants lived. Outside she
noticed a youth who was handsomer than any prince she had ever seen, and in a moment she knew
him to be the little boy she had once played with.

'Tell me your secret and I will marry you,' she said to him; but the boy only gave her the
beating he had promised her long ago, when she asked him the same question. The girl was very
angry, besides being hurt, and ran home to complain to her father.

'If he had a thousand souls, I would kill them all,' swore the king.

That very day a gallows was built outside the town, and all the people crowded round to see
the execution of the young man who had dared to beat the king's daughter. The prisoner, with
his hands tied behind his back, was brought out by the hangman, and amidst dead silence his
sentence was being read by the judge when suddenly the sword clanked against his side. Instantly
a great noise was heard and a golden coach rumbled over the stones, with a white flag waving
out of the window. It stopped underneath the gallows, and from it stepped the king of the Magyars,
who begged that the life of the boy might be spared.

'Sir, he has beaten my daughter, who only asked him to tell her his secret. I cannot pardon
that,' answered the princess's father.

'Give him to me, I'm sure he will tell me the secret; or, if not, I have a daughter who is
like the Morning Star, and he is sure to tell it to her.'

The sword clanked for the third time, and the king said angrily: 'Well, if you want him so
much you can have him; only never let me see his face again.' And he made a sign to the hangman.
The bandage was removed from the young man's eyes, and the cords from his wrists, and he took
his seat in the golden coach beside the king of the Magyars. Then the coachman whipped up his
horses, and they set out for Buda.

The king talked very pleasantly for a few miles, and when he thought that his new companion
was quite at ease with him, he asked him what was the secret which had brought him into such
trouble. 'That I cannot tell you,' answered the youth, 'until it comes true.'

'You will tell my daughter,' said the king, smiling.

'I will tell nobody,' replied the youth, and as he spoke the sword clanked loudly. The king
said no more, but trusted to his daughter's beauty to get the secret from him.

The journey to Buda was long, and it was several days before they arrived there. The beautiful
princess happened to be picking roses in the garden, when her father's coach drove up.

'Oh, what a handsome youth! Have you brought him from fairyland?' cried she, when they all
stood upon the marble steps in front of the castle.

'I have brought him from the gallows,' answered the king; rather vexed at his daughter's words,
as never before had she consented to speak to any man.

'I don't care where you brought him from,' said the spoilt girl. 'I will marry him and nobody
else, and we will live together till we die.'

'You will tell another tale,' replied the king, 'when you ask him his secret. After all he
is no better than a servant.'

'That is nothing to me,' said the princess, 'for I love him. He will tell his secret to me,
and will find a place in the middle of my heart.'

But the king shook his head, and gave orders that the lad was to be lodged in the summer-house.

One day, about a week later, the princess put on her finest dress, and went to pay him a visit.
She looked so beautiful that, at the sight of her, the book dropped from his hand, and he stood
up speechless. 'Tell me,' she said, coaxingly, 'what is this wonderful secret? Just whisper
it in my ear, and I will give you a kiss.'

'My angel,' he answered, 'be wise, and ask no questions, if you wish to get safely back to
your father's palace; I have kept my secret all these years, and do not mean to tell it now.'

However, the girl would not listen, and went on pressing him, till at last he slapped her face
so hard that her nose bled. She shrieked with pain and rage, and ran screaming back to the
palace, where her father was waiting to hear if she had succeeded. 'I will starve you to death,
you son of a dragon,' cried he, when he saw her dress streaming with blood; and he ordered
all the masons and bricklayers in the town to come before him.

'Build me a tower as fast as you can,' he said, 'and see that there is room for a stool and
a small table, and for nothing else. The men set to work, and in two hours the tower was built,
and they proceeded to the palace to inform the king that his commands were fulfilled. On the
way they met the princess, who began to talk to one of the masons, and when the rest were out
of hearing she asked if he could manage to make a hole in the tower, which nobody could see,
large enough for a bottle of wine and some food to pass through.

'To be sure I can,' said the mason, turning back, and in a few minutes the hole was bored.

At sunset a large crowd assembled to watch the youth being led to the tower, and after his
misdeeds had been proclaimed he was solemnly walled up. But every morning the princess passed
him in food through the hole, and every third day the king sent his secretary to climb up a
ladder and look down through a little window to see if he was dead. But the secretary always
brought back the report that he was fat and rosy.

'There is some magic about this,' said the king.

This state of affairs lasted some time, till one day a messenger arrived from the Sultan bearing
a letter for the king, and also three canes. 'My master bids me say,' said the messenger, bowing
low, 'that if you cannot tell him which of these three canes grows nearest the root, which
in the middle, and which at the top, he will declare war against you.

The king was very much frightened when he heard this, and though he took the canes and examined
them closely, he could see no difference between them. He looked so sad that his daughter noticed
it, and inquired the reason.

'Alas! my daughter,' he answered, 'how can I help being sad? The Sultan has sent me three canes,
and says that if I cannot tell him which of them grows near the root, which in the middle,
and which at the top, he will make war upon me. And you know that his army is far greater than
mine.'

'Oh, do not despair, my father,' said she. 'We shall be sure to find out the answer'; and she
ran away to the tower, and told the young man what had occurred.

'Go to bed as usual,' replied he, 'and when you wake, tell your father that you have dreamed
that the canes must be placed in warm water. After a little while one will sink to the bottom;
that is the one that grows nearest the root. The one which neither sinks nor comes to the surface
is the cane that is cut from the middle; and the one that floats is from the top.'

So, the next morning, the princess told her father of her dream, and by her advice he cut notches
in each of the canes when he took them out of the water, so that he might make no mistake when
he handed them back to the messenger. The Sultan could not imagine how he had found out, but
he did not declare war.

The following year the Sultan again wanted to pick a quarrel with the king of the Magyars,
so he sent another messenger to him with three foals, begging him to say which of the animals
was born in the morning, which at noon, and which in the evening. If an answer was not ready
in three days, war would be declared at once. The king's heart sank when he read the letter.
He could not expect his daughter to be lucky enough to dream rightly a second time, and as
a plague had been raging through the country, and had carried off many of his soldiers, his
army was even weaker than before. At this thought his face became so gloomy that his daughter
noticed it, and inquired what was the matter.

'I have had another letter from the Sultan,' replied the king, 'and he says that if I cannot
tell him which of three foals was born in the morning, which at noon, and which in the evening,
he will declare war at once.'

'Oh, don't be cast down,' said she, 'something is sure to happen'; and she ran down to the
tower to consult the youth.

'Go home, idol of my heart, and when night comes, pretend to scream out in your sleep, so that
your father hears you. Then tell him that you have dreamt that he was just being carried off
by the Turks because he could not answer the question about the foals, when the lad whom he
had shut up in the tower ran up and told them which was foaled in the morning, which at noon,
and which in the evening.'

So the princess did exactly as the youth had bidden her; and no sooner had she spoken than
the king ordered the tower to be pulled down, and the prisoner brought before him.

'I did not think that you could have lived so long without food,' said he, 'and as you have
had plenty of time to repent your wicked conduct, I will grant you pardon, on condition that
you help me in a sore strait. Read this letter from the Sultan; you will see that if I fail
to answer his question about the foals, a dreadful war will be the result.'

The youth took the letter and read it through. 'Yes, I can help you,' replied he; 'but first
you must bring me three troughs, all exactly alike. Into one you must put oats, into another
wheat, and into the third barley. The foal which eats the oats is that which was foaled in
the morning; the foal which eats the wheat is that which was foaled at noon; and the foal which
eats the barley is that which was foaled at night.' The king followed the youth's directions,
and, marking the foals, sent them back to Turkey, and there was no war that year.

Now the Sultan was very angry that both his plots to get possession of Hungary had been such
total failures, and he sent for his aunt, who was a witch, to consult her as to what he should
do next.

'It is not the king who has answered your questions,' observed the aunt, when he had told his
story. 'He is far too stupid ever to have done that! The person who has found out the puzzle
is the son of a poor woman, who, if he lives, will become King of Hungary. Therefore, if you
want the crown yourself, you must get him here and kill him.'

After this conversation another letter was written to the Court of Hungary, saying that if
the youth, now in the palace, was not sent to Turkey within three days, a large army would
cross the border. The king's heart was sorrowful as he read, for he was grateful to the lad
for what he had done to help him; but the boy only laughed, and bade the king fear nothing,
but to search the town instantly for two youths just like each other, and he would paint himself
a mask that was just like them. And the sword at his side clanked loudly.

After a long search twin brothers were found, so exactly resembling each other that even their
own mother could not tell the difference. The youth painted a mask that was the precise copy
of them, and when he had put it on, no one would have known one boy from the other. They set
out at once for the Sultan's palace, and when they reached it, they were taken straight into
his presence. He made a sign for them to come near; they all bowed low in greeting. He asked
them about their journey; they answered his questions all together, and in the same words.
If one sat down to supper, the others sat down at the same instant. When one got up, the others
got up too, as if there had been only one body between them. The Sultan could not detect any
difference between them, and he told his aunt that he would not be so cruel as to kill all three.

'Well, you will see a difference to-morrow,' replied the witch, 'for one will have a cut on
his sleeve. That is the youth you must kill.' And one hour before midnight, when witches are
invisible, she glided into the room where all three lads were sleeping in the same bed. She
took out a pair of scissors and cut a small piece out of the boy's coat-sleeve which was hanging
on the wall, and then crept silently from the room. But in the morning the youth saw the slit,
and he marked the sleeves of his two companions in the same way, and all three went down to
breakfast with the Sultan. The old witch was standing in the window and pretended not to see
them; but all witches have eyes in the backs of their heads, and she knew at once that not
one sleeve but three were cut, and they were all as alike as before. After breakfast, the Sultan,
who was getting tired of the whole affair and wanted to be alone to invent some other plan,
told them they might return home. So, bowing low with one accord, they went.

The princess welcomed the boy back joyfully, but the poor youth was not allowed to rest long
in peace, for one day a fresh letter arrived from the Sultan, saying that he had discovered
that the young man was a very dangerous person, and that he must be sent to Turkey at once,
and alone. The girl burst into tears when the boy told her what was in the letter which her
father had bade her to carry to him. 'Do not weep, love of my heart,' said the boy, 'all will
be well. I will start at sunrise to-morrow.'

So next morning at sunrise the youth set forth, and in a few days he reached the Sultan's palace.
The old witch was waiting for him at the gate, and whispered as he passed: 'This is the last
time you will ever enter it.' But the sword clanked, and the lad did not even look at her.
As he crossed the threshold fifteen armed Turks barred his way, with the Sultan at their head.
Instantly the sword darted forth and cut off the heads of everyone but the Sultan, and then
went quietly back to its scabbard. The witch, who was looking on, saw that as long as the youth
had possession of the sword, all her schemes would be in vain, and tried to steal the sword
in the night, but it only jumped out of its scabbard and sliced off her nose, which was of
iron. And in the morning, when the Sultan brought a great army to capture the lad and deprive
him of his sword, they were all cut to pieces, while he remained without a scratch.

Meanwhile the princess was in despair because the days slipped by, and the young man did not
return, and she never rested until her father let her lead some troops against the Sultan.
She rode proudly before them, dressed in uniform; but they had not left the town more than
a mile behind them, when they met the lad and his little sword. When he told them what he had
done they shouted for joy, and carried him back in triumph to the palace; and the king declared
that as the youth had shown himself worthy to become his son-in-law, he should marry the princess
and succeed to the throne at once, as he himself was getting old, and the cares of government
were too much for him. But the young man said he must first go and see his mother, and the
king sent him in state, with a troop of soldiers as his bodyguard.

The old woman was quite frightened at seeing such an array draw up before her little house,
and still more surprised when a handsome young man, whom she did not know, dismounted and kissed
her hand, saying: 'Now, dear mother, you shall hear my secret at last! I dreamed that I should
become King of Hungary, and my dream has come true. When I was a child, and you begged me to
tell you, I had to keep silence, or the Magyar king would have killed me. And if you had not
beaten me nothing would have happened that has happened, and I should not now be King of Hungary.'

[From the Folk Tales of the Magyars.]

The Prince And The Dragon

Once upon a time there lived an emperor who had three sons. They were all fine young men, and
fond of hunting, and scarcely a day passed without one or other of them going out to look for game.

One morning the eldest of the three princes mounted his horse and set out for a neighbouring
forest, where wild animals of all sorts were to be found. He had not long left the castle,
when a hare sprang out of a thicket and dashed across the road in front. The young man gave
chase at once, and pursued it over hill and dale, till at last the hare took refuge in a mill
which was standing by the side of a river. The prince followed and entered the mill, but stopped
in terror by the door, for, instead of a hare, before him stood a dragon, breathing fire and
flame. At this fearful sight the prince turned to fly, but a fiery tongue coiled round his
waist, and drew him into the dragon's mouth, and he was seen no more.

A week passed away, and when the prince never came back everyone in the town began to grow
uneasy. At last his next brother told the emperor that he likewise would go out to hunt, and
that perhaps he would find some clue as to his brother's disappearance. But hardly had the
castle gates closed on the prince than the hare sprang out of the bushes as before, and led
the huntsman up hill and down dale, till they reached the mill. Into this the hare flew with
the prince at his heels, when, lo! instead of the hare, there stood a dragon breathing fire
and flame; and out shot a fiery tongue which coiled round the prince's waist, and lifted him
straight into the dragon's mouth, and he was seen no more.

Days went by, and the emperor waited and waited for the sons who never came, and could not
sleep at night for wondering where they were and what had become of them. His youngest son
wished to go in search of his brothers, but for long the emperor refused to listen to him,
lest he should lose him also. But the prince prayed so hard for leave to make the search, and
promised so often that he would be very cautious and careful, that at length the emperor gave
him permission, and ordered the best horse in the stables to be saddled for him.

Full of hope the young prince started on his way, but no sooner was he outside the city walls
than a hare sprang out of the bushes and ran before him, till they reached the mill. As before,
the animal dashed in through the open door, but this time he was not followed by the prince.
Wiser than his brothers, the young man turned away, saying to himself: 'There are as good hares
in the forest as any that have come out of it, and when I have caught them, I can come back
and look for you.'

For many hours he rode up and down the mountain, but saw nothing, and at last, tired of waiting,
he went back to the mill. Here he found an old woman sitting, whom he greeted pleasantly.

'Good morning to you, little mother,' he said; and the old woman answered: 'Good morning, my son.'

'Tell me, little mother,' went on the prince, 'where shall I find my hare?'

'My son,' replied the old woman, 'that was no hare, but a dragon who has led many men hither,
and then has eaten them all.' At these words the prince's heart grew heavy, and he cried, 'Then
my brothers must have come here, and have been eaten by the dragon!'

'You have guessed right,' answered the old woman; 'and I can give you no better counsel than
to go home at once, before the same fate overtakes you.'

'Will you not come with me out of this dreadful place?' said the young man.

'He took me prisoner, too,' answered she, 'and I cannot shake off his chains.'

'Then listen to me,' cried the prince. 'When the dragon comes back, ask him where he always
goes when he leaves here, and what makes him so strong; and when you have coaxed the secret
from him, tell me the next time I come.'

So the prince went home, and the old woman remained in the mill, and as soon as the dragon
returned she said to him:

'Where have you been all this time--you must have travelled far?'

'Yes, little mother, I have indeed travelled far.' answered he. Then the old woman began to
flatter him, and to praise his cleverness; and when she thought she had got him into a good
temper, she said: 'I have wondered so often where you get your strength from; I do wish you
would tell me. I would stoop and kiss the place out of pure love!' The dragon laughed at this,
and answered:

'In the hearthstone yonder lies the secret of my strength.'

Then the old woman jumped up and kissed the hearth; whereat the dragon laughed the more, and said:

'You foolish creature! I was only jesting. It is not in the hearthstone, but in that tall tree
that lies the secret of my strength.' Then the old woman jumped up again and put her arms round
the tree, and kissed it heartily. Loudly laughed the dragon when he saw what she was doing.

'Old fool,' he cried, as soon as he could speak, 'did you really believe that my strength came
from that tree?'

'Where is it then?' asked the old woman, rather crossly, for she did not like being made fun of.

'My strength,' replied the dragon, 'lies far away; so far that you could never reach it. Far,
far from here is a kingdom, and by its capital city is a lake, and in the lake is a dragon,
and inside the dragon is a wild boar, and inside the wild boar is a pigeon, and inside the
pigeon a sparrow, and inside the sparrow is my strength.' And when the old woman heard this,
she thought it was no use flattering him any longer, for never, never, could she take his strength
from him.

The following morning, when the dragon had left the mill, the prince came back, and the old
woman told him all that the creature had said. He listened in silence, and then returned to
the castle, where he put on a suit of shepherd's clothes, and taking a staff in his hand, he
went forth to seek a place as tender of sheep.

For some time he wandered from village to village and from town to town, till he came at length
to a large city in a distant kingdom, surrounded on three sides by a great lake, which happened
to be the very lake in which the dragon lived. As was his custom, he stopped everybody whom
he met in the streets that looked likely to want a shepherd and begged them to engage him,
but they all seemed to have shepherds of their own, or else not to need any. The prince was
beginning to lose heart, when a man who had overheard his question turned round and said that
he had better go and ask the emperor, as he was in search of some one to see after his flocks.

'Will you take care of my sheep?' said the emperor, when the young man knelt before him.

'Most willingly, your Majesty,' answered the young man, and he listened obediently while the
emperor told him what he was to do.

'Outside the city walls,' went on the emperor, 'you will find a large lake, and by its banks
lie the richest meadows in my kingdom. When you are leading out your flocks to pasture, they
will all run straight to these meadows, and none that have gone there have ever been known
to come back. Take heed, therefore, my son, not to suffer your sheep to go where they will,
but drive them to any spot that you think best.'

With a low bow the prince thanked the emperor for his warning, and promised to do his best
to keep the sheep safe. Then he left the palace and went to the market-place, where he bought
two greyhounds, a hawk, and a set of pipes; after that he took the sheep out to pasture. The
instant the animals caught sight of the lake lying before them, they trotted off as fast as
their legs would go to the green meadows lying round it. The prince did not try to stop them;
he only placed his hawk on the branch of a tree, laid his pipes on the grass, and bade the
greyhounds sit still; then, rolling up his sleeves and trousers, he waded into the water crying
as he did so: 'Dragon! dragon! if you are not a coward, come out and fight with me!' And a
voice answered from the depths of the lake:

'I am waiting for you, O prince'; and the next minute the dragon reared himself out of the
water, huge and horrible to see. The prince sprang upon him and they grappled with each other
and fought together till the sun was high, and it was noonday. Then the dragon gasped:

'O prince, let me dip my burning head once into the lake, and I will hurl you up to the top
of the sky.' But the prince answered, 'Oh, ho! my good dragon, do not crow too soon! If the
emperor's daughter were only here, and would kiss me on the forehead, I would throw you up
higher still!' And suddenly the dragon's hold loosened, and he fell back into the lake.

As soon as it was evening, the prince washed away all signs of the fight, took his hawk upon
his shoulder, and his pipes under his arm, and with his greyhounds in front and his flock following
after him he set out for the city. As they all passed through the streets the people stared
in wonder, for never before had any flock returned from the lake.

The next morning he rose early, and led his sheep down the road to the lake. This time, however,
the emperor sent two men on horseback to ride behind him, with orders to watch the prince all
day long. The horsemen kept the prince and his sheep in sight, without being seen themselves.
As soon as they beheld the sheep running towards the meadows, they turned aside up a steep
hill, which overhung the lake. When the shepherd reached the place he laid, as before, his
pipes on the grass and bade the greyhounds sit beside them, while the hawk he perched on the
branch of the tree. Then he rolled up his trousers and his sleeves, and waded into the water
crying:

'Dragon! dragon! if you are not a coward, come out and fight with me!' And the dragon answered:

'I am waiting for you, O prince,' and the next minute he reared himself out of the water, huge
and horrible to see. When he passed through the gates all the people came out of their houses
to stare in wonder, for never before had any flock returned from the lake.

Meanwhile the two horsemen had ridden quickly back, and told the emperor all that they had
seen and heard. The emperor listened eagerly to their tale, then called his daughter to him
and repeated it to her.

'To-morrow,' he said, when he had finished, 'you shall go with the shepherd to the lake, and
then you shall kiss him on the forehead as he wishes.'

But when the princess heard these words, she burst into tears, and sobbed out:

'Will you really send me, your only child, to that dreadful place, from which most likely I
shall never come back?'

'Fear nothing, my little daughter, all will be well. Many shepherds have gone to that lake
and none have ever returned; but this one has in these two days fought twice with the dragon
and has escaped without a wound. So I hope to-morrow he will kill the dragon altogether, and
deliver this land from the monster who has slain so many of our bravest men.'

Scarcely had the sun begun to peep over the hills next morning, when the princess stood by
the shepherd's side, ready to go to the lake. The shepherd was brimming over with joy, but
the princess only wept bitterly. 'Dry your tears, I implore you,' said he. 'If you will just
do what I ask you, and when the time comes, run and kiss my forehead, you have nothing to fear.'

Merrily the shepherd blew on his pipes as he marched at the head of his flock, only stopping
every now and then to say to the weeping girl at his side:

'Do not cry so, Heart of Gold; trust me and fear nothing.' And so they reached the lake.

In an instant the sheep were scattered all over the meadows, and the prince placed his hawk
on the tree, and his pipes on the grass, while he bade his greyhounds lie beside them. Then
the prince swung the dragon straight up into the clouds, and when he touched the earth again,
he broke into a thousand pieces. Out of the pieces there sprang a wild boar and galloped away,
but the prince called his hounds to give chase, and they caught the boar and tore it to bits.
Out of the pieces there sprang a hare, and in a moment the greyhounds were after it, and they
caught it and killed it; and out of the hare there came a pigeon. Quickly the prince let loose
his hawk, which soared straight into the air, then swooped upon the bird and brought it to
his master. The prince cut open its body and found the sparrow inside, as the old woman had said.

'Now,' cried the prince, holding the sparrow in his hand, 'now you shall tell me where I can
find my brothers.'

'Do not hurt me,' answered the sparrow, 'and I will tell you with all my heart.' Behind your
father's castle stands a mill, and in the mill are three slender twigs. Cut off these twigs
and strike their roots with them, and the iron door of a cellar will open. In the cellar you
will find as many people, young and old, women and children, as would fill a kingdom, and among
them are your brothers.'

By this time twilight had fallen, so the prince washed himself in the lake, took the hawk on
his shoulder and the pipes under his arm, and with his greyhounds before him and his flock
behind him, marched gaily into the town, the princess following them all, still trembling with
fright. And so they passed through the streets, thronged with a wondering crowd, till they
reached the castle.

Unknown to anyone, the emperor had stolen out on horseback, and had hidden himself on the hill,
where he could see all that happened. When all was over, and the power of the dragon was broken
for ever, he rode quickly back to the castle, and was ready to receive the prince with open
arms, and to promise him his daughter to wife. The wedding took place with great splendour,
and for a whole week the town was hung with coloured lamps, and tables were spread in the hall
of the castle for all who chose to come and eat. And when the feast was over, the prince told
the emperor and the people who he really was, and at this everyone rejoiced still more, and
preparations were made for the prince and princess to return to their own kingdom, for the
prince was impatient to set free his brothers.

The first thing he did when he reached his native country was to hasten to the mill, where
he found the three twigs as the sparrow had told him. The moment that he struck the root the
iron door flew open, and from the cellar a countless multitude of men and women streamed forth.
He bade them go one by one wheresoever they would, while he himself waited by the door till
his brothers passed through. How delighted they were to meet again, and to hear all that the
prince had done to deliver them from their enchantment. And they went home with him and served
him all the days of their lives, for they said that he only who had proved himself brave and
faithful was fit to be king.

Little Wildrose

Once upon a time the things in this story happened, and if they had not happened then the story
would never have been told. But that was the time when wolves and lambs lay peacefully together
in one stall, and shepherds dined on grassy banks with kings and queens.

Once upon a time, then, my dear good children, there lived a man. Now this man was really a
hundred years old, if not fully twenty years more. And his wife was very old too--how old I
do not know; but some said she was as old as the goddess Venus herself. They had been very
happy all these years, but they would have been happier still if they had had any children;
but old though they were they had never made up their minds to do without them, and often they
would sit over the fire and talk of how they would have brought up their children if only some
had come to their house.

One day the old man seemed sadder and more thoughtful than was common with him, and at last
he said to his wife: 'Listen to me, old woman!'

'What do you want?' asked she.

'Get me some money out of the chest, for I am going a long journey--all through the world--to
see if I cannot find a child, for my heart aches to think that after I am dead my house will
fall into the hands of a stranger. And this let me tell you: that if I never find a child I
shall not come home again.'

Then the old man took a bag and filled it with food and money, and throwing it over his shoulders,
bade his wife farewell.

For long he wandered, and wandered, and wandered, but no child did he see; and one morning
his wanderings led him to a forest which was so thick with trees that no light could pass through
the branches. The old man stopped when he saw this dreadful place, and at first was afraid
to go in; but he remembered that, after all, as the proverb says: 'It is the unexpected that
happens,' and perhaps in the midst of this black spot he might find the child he was seeking.
So summoning up all his courage he plunged boldly in.

How long he might have been walking there he never could have told you, when at last he reached
the mouth of a cave where the darkness seemed a hundred times darker than the wood itself.
Again he paused, but he felt as if something was driving him to enter, and with a beating heart
he stepped in.

For some minutes the silence and darkness so appalled him that he stood where he was, not daring
to advance one step. Then he made a great effort and went on a few paces, and suddenly, far
before him, he saw the glimmer of a light. This put new heart into him, and he directed his
steps straight towards the faint rays, till he could see, sitting by it, an old hermit, with
a long white beard.

The hermit either did not hear the approach of his visitor, or pretended not to do so, for
he took no notice, and continued to read his book. After waiting patiently for a little while,
the old man fell on his knees, and said: 'Good morning, holy father!' But he might as well
have spoken to the rock. 'Good morning, holy father,' he said again, a little louder than before,
and this time the hermit made a sign to him to come nearer. 'My son,' whispered he, in a voice
that echoed through the cavern, 'what brings you to this dark and dismal place? Hundreds of
years have passed since my eyes have rested on the face of a man, and I did not think to look
on one again.'.

'My misery has brought me here,' replied the old man; 'I have no child, and all our lives my
wife and I have longed for one. So I left my home, and went out into the world, hoping that
somewhere I might find what I was seeking.'

Then the hermit picked up an apple from the ground, and gave it to him, saying: 'Eat half of
this apple, and give the rest to your wife, and cease wandering through the world.'

The old man stooped and kissed the feet of the hermit for sheer joy, and left the cave. He
made his way through the forest as fast as the darkness would let him, and at length arrived
in flowery fields, which dazzled him with their brightness. Suddenly he was seized with a desperate
thirst, and a burning in his throat. He looked for a stream but none was to be seen, and his
tongue grew more parched every moment. At length his eyes fell on the apple, which all this
while he had been holding in his hand, and in his thirst he forgot what the hermit had told
him, and instead of eating merely his own half, he ate up the old woman's also; after that
he went to sleep.

When he woke up he saw something strange lying on a bank a little way off, amidst long trails
of pink roses. The old man got up, rubbed his eyes, and went to see what it was, when, to his
surprise and joy, it proved to be a little girl about two years old, with a skin as pink and
white as the roses above her. He took her gently in his arms, but she did not seem at all frightened,
and only jumped and crowed with delight; and the old man wrapped his cloak round her, and set
off for home as fast as his legs would carry him.

When they were close to the cottage where they lived he laid the child in a pail that was standing
near the door, and ran into the house, crying: 'Come quickly, wife, quickly, for I have brought
you a daughter, with hair of gold and eyes like stars!'

At this wonderful news the old woman flew downstairs, almost tumbling down ill her eagerness
to see the treasure; but when her husband led her to the pail it was perfectly empty! The old
man was nearly beside himself with horror, while his wife sat down and sobbed with grief and
disappointment. There was not a spot round about which they did not search, thinking that somehow
the child might have got out of the pail and hidden itself for fun; but the little girl was
not there, and there was no sign of her.

'Where can she be?' moaned the old man, in despair. 'Oh, why did I ever leave her, even for
a moment? Have the fairies taken her, or has some wild beast carried her off?' And they began
their search all over again; but neither fairies nor wild beasts did they meet with, and with
sore hearts they gave it up at last and turned sadly into the hut.

And what had become of the baby? Well, finding herself left alone in a strange place she began
to cry with fright, and an eagle hovering near, heard her, and went to see what the sound came
from. When he beheld the fat pink and white creature he thought of his hungry little ones at
home, and swooping down he caught her up in his claws and was soon flying with her over the
tops of the trees. In a few minutes he reached the one in which he had built his nest, and
laying little Wildrose (for so the old man had called her) among his downy young eaglets, he
flew away. The eaglets naturally were rather surprised at this strange animal, so suddenly
popped down in their midst, but instead of beginning to eat her, as their father expected,
they nestled up close to her and spread out their tiny wings to shield her from the sun.

Now, in the depths of the forest where the eagle had built his nest, there ran a stream whose
waters were poisonous, and on the banks of this stream dwelt a horrible lindworm with seven
heads. The lindworm had often watched the eagle flying about the top of the tree, carrying
food to his young ones and, accordingly, he watched carefully for the moment when the eaglets
began to try their wings and to fly away from the nest. Of course, if the eagle himself was
there to protect them even the lindworm, big and strong as he was, knew that he could do nothing;
but when he was absent, any little eaglets who ventured too near the ground would be sure to
disappear down the monster's throat. Their brothers, who had been left behind as too young
and weak to see the world, knew nothing of all this, but supposed their turn would soon come
to see the world also. And in a few days their eyes, too, opened and their wings flapped impatiently,
and they longed to fly away above the waving tree-tops to mountain and the bright sun beyond.
But that very midnight the lindworm, who was hungry and could not wait for his supper, came
out of the brook with a rushing noise, and made straight for the tree. Two eyes of flame came
creeping nearer, nearer, and two fiery tongues were stretching themselves out closer, closer,
to the little birds who were trembling and shuddering in the farthest corner of the nest. But
just as the tongues had almost reached them, the lindworm gave a fearful cry, and turned and
fell backwards. Then came the sound of battle from the ground below, and the tree shook, though
there was no wind, and roars and snarls mixed together, till the eaglets felt more frightened
than ever, and thought their last hour had come. Only Wildrose was undisturbed, and slept sweetly
through it all.

In the morning the eagle returned and saw traces of a fight below the tree, and here and there
a handful of yellow mane lying about, and here and there a hard scaly substance; when he saw
that he rejoiced greatly, and hastened to the nest.

'Who has slain the lindworm?' he asked of his children; there were so many that he did not
at first miss the two which the lindworm had eaten. But the eaglets answered that they could
not tell, only that they had been in danger of their lives, and at the last moment they had
been delivered. Then the sunbeam had struggled through the thick branches and caught Wildrose's
golden hair as she lay curled up in the corner, and the eagle wondered, as he looked, whether
the little girl had brought him luck, and it was her magic which had killed his enemy.

'Children,' he said, 'I brought her here for your dinner, and you have not touched her; what
is the meaning of this?' But the eaglets did not answer, and Wildrose opened her eyes, and
seemed seven times lovelier than before.

From that day Wildrose lived like a little princess. The eagle flew about the wood and collected
the softest, greenest moss he could find to make her a bed, and then he picked with his beak
all the brightest and prettiest flowers in the fields or on the mountains to decorate it. So
cleverly did he manage it that there was not a fairy in the whole of the forest who would not
have been pleased to sleep there, rocked to and fro by the breeze on the treetops. And when
the little ones were able to fly from their nest he taught them where to look for the fruits
and berries which she loved.

So the time passed by, and with each year Wildrose grew taller and more beautiful, and she
lived happily in her nest and never wanted to go out of it, only standing at the edge in the
sunset, and looking upon the beautiful world. For company she had all the birds in the forest,
who came and talked to her, and for playthings the strange flowers which they brought her from
far, and the butterflies which danced with her. And so the days slipped away, and she was fourteen
years old.

One morning the emperor's son went out to hunt, and he had not ridden far, before a deer started
from under a grove of trees, and ran before him. The prince instantly gave chase, and where
the stag led he followed, till at length he found himself in the depths of the forest, where
no man before had trod.

The trees were so thick and the wood so dark, that he paused for a moment and listened, straining
his ears to catch some sound to break a silence which almost frightened him. But nothing came,
not even the baying of a hound or the note of a horn. He stood still, and wondered if he should
go on, when, on looking up, a stream of light seemed to flow from the top of a tall tree. In
its rays he could see the nest with the young eaglets, who were watching him over the side.
The prince fitted an arrow into his bow and took his aim, but, before he could let fly, another
ray of light dazzled him; so brilliant was it, that his bow dropped, and he covered his face
with his hands. When at last he ventured to peep, Wildrose, with her golden hair flowing round
her, was looking at him. This was the first time she had seen a man.

'Tell me how I can reach you?' cried he; but Wildrose smiled and shook her head, and sat down
quietly.

The prince saw that it was no use, and turned and made his way out of the forest. But he might
as well have stayed there, for any good he was to his father, so full was his heart of longing
for Wildrose. Twice he returned to the forest in the hopes of finding her, but this time fortune
failed him, and he went home as sad as ever.

At length the emperor, who could not think what had caused this change, sent for his son and
asked him what was the matter. Then the prince confessed that the image of Wildrose filled
his soul, and that he would never be happy without her. At first the emperor felt rather distressed.
He doubted whether a girl from a tree top would make a good empress; but he loved his son so
much that he promised to do all he could to find her. So the next morning heralds were sent
forth throughout the whole land to inquire if anyone knew where a maiden could be found who
lived in a forest on the top of a tree, and to promise great riches and a place at court to
any person who should find her. But nobody knew. All the girls in the kingdom had their homes
on the ground, and laughed at the notion of being brought up in a tree. 'A nice kind of empress
she would make,' they said, as the emperor had done, tossing their heads with disdain; for,
having read many books, they guessed what she was wanted for.

The heralds were almost in despair, when an old woman stepped out of the crowd and came and
spoke to them. She was not only very old, but she was very ugly, with a hump on her back and
a bald head, and when the heralds saw her they broke into rude laughter. 'I can show you the
maiden who lives in the tree-top,' she said, but they only laughed the more loudly.

'Get away, old witch!' they cried, 'you will bring us bad luck'; but the old woman stood firm,
and declared that she alone knew where to find the maiden.

'Go with her,' said the eldest of the heralds at last. 'The emperor's orders are clear, that
whoever knew anything of the maiden was to come at once to court. Put her in the coach and
take her with us.'

So in this fashion the old woman was brought to court.

'You have declared that you can bring hither the maiden from the wood?' said the emperor, who
was seated on his throne.

'Yes, your Majesty, and I will keep my word,' said she.

'Then bring her at once,' said the emperor.

'Give me first a kettle and a tripod,' asked the old w omen, and the emperor ordered them to
be brought instantly. The old woman picked them up, and tucking them under her arm went on
her way, keeping at a little distance behind the royal huntsmen, who in their turn followed
the prince.

Oh, what a noise that old woman made as she walked along! She chattered to herself so fast
and clattered her kettle so loudly that you would have thought that a whole campful of gipsies
must be coming round the next corner. But when they reached the forest, she bade them all wait
outside, and entered the dark wood by herself.

She stopped underneath the tree where the maiden dwelt and, gathering some dry sticks, kindled
a fire. Next, she placed the tripod over it, and the kettle on top. But something was the matter
with the kettle. As fast as the old woman put it where it was to stand, that kettle was sure
to roll off, falling to the ground with a crash.

It really seemed bewitched, and no one knows what might have happened if Wildrose, who had
been all the time peeping out of her nest, had not lost patience at the old woman's stupidity,
and cried out: 'The tripod won't stand on that hill, you must move it!'

'But where am I to move it to, my child?' asked the old woman, looking up to the nest, and
at the same moment trying to steady the kettle with one hand and the tripod with the other.

'Didn't I tell you that it was no good doing that,' said Wildrose, more impatiently than before.
'Make a fire near a tree and hang the kettle from one of the branches.'

The old woman took the kettle and hung it on a little twig, which broke at once, and the kettle
fell to the ground.

'If you would only show me how to do it, perhaps I should understand,' said she.

Quick as thought, the maiden slid down the smooth trunk of the tree, and stood beside the stupid
old woman, to teach her how things ought to be done. But in an instant the old woman had caught
up the girl and swung her over her shoulders, and was running as fast as she could go to the
edge of the forest, where she had left the prince. When he saw them coming he rushed eagerly
to meet them, and he took the maiden in his arms and kissed her tenderly before them all. Then
a golden dress was put on her, and pearls were twined in her hair, and she took her seat in
the emperor's carriage which was drawn by six of the whitest horses in the world, and they
carried her, without stopping to draw breath, to the gates of the palace. And in three days
the wedding was celebrated, and the wedding feast was held, and everyone who saw the bride
declared that if anybody wanted a perfect wife they must go to seek her on top of a tree.

Tiidu The Piper

Once upon a time there lived a poor man who had more children than bread to feed them with.
However, they were strong and willing, and soon learned to make themselves of use to their
father and mother, and when they were old enough they went out to service, and everyone was
very glad to get them for servants, for they worked hard and were always cheerful. Out of all
the ten or eleven, there was only one who gave his parents any trouble, and this was a big
lazy boy whose name was Tiidu. Neither scoldings nor beatings nor kind words had any effect
on him, and the older he grew the idler he got. He spent his winters crouching close to a warm
stove, and his summers asleep under a shady tree; and if he was not doing either of these things
he was playing tunes on his flute.

One day he was sitting under a bush playing so sweetly that you might easily have mistaken
the notes for those of a bird, when an old man passed by. 'What trade do you wish to follow,
my son?' he asked in a friendly voice, stopping as he did so in front of the youth.

'If I were only a rich man, and had no need to work,' replied the boy, 'I should not follow
any. I could not bear to be anybody's servant, as all my brothers and sisters are.'

The old man laughed as he heard this answer, and said: 'But I do not exactly see where your
riches are to come from if you do not work for them. Sleeping cats catch no mice. He who wishes
to become rich must use either his hands or his head, and be ready to toil night and day, or
else--'

But here the youth broke in rudely:

'Be silent, old man! I have been told all that a hundred times over; and it runs off me like
water off a duck's back. No one will ever make a worker out of me.'

'You have one gift,' replied the old man, taking no notice of this speech, 'and if you would
only go about and play the pipes, you would easily earn, not only your daily bread, but a little
money into the bargain. Listen to me; get yourself a set of pipes, and learn to play on them
as well as you do on your flute, and wherever there are men to hear you, I promise you will
never lack money.'

'But where am I to get the pipes from?' asked the youth.

'Blow on your flute for a few days,' replied the old man, 'and you will soon be able to buy
your pipes. By-and-by I will come back again and see if you have taken my advice, and whether
you are likely to grow rich.' And so saying he went his way.

Tiidu stayed where he was a little longer, thinking of all the old man had told him, and the
more he thought the surer he felt that the old man was right. He determined to try whether
his plan would really bring luck; but as he did not like being laughed at he resolved not to
tell anyone a word about it. So next morning he left home--and never came back! His parents
did not take his loss much to heart, but were rather glad that their useless son had for once
shown a little spirit, and they hoped that time and hardship might cure Tiidu of his idle folly.

For some weeks Tiidu wandered from one village to another, and proved for himself the truth
of the old man's promise. The people he met were all friendly and kind, and enjoyed his flute-playing,
giving him his food in return, and even a few pence. These pence the youth hoarded carefully
till he had collected enough to buy a beautiful pair of pipes. Then he felt himself indeed
on the high road to riches. Nowhere could pipes be found as fine as his, or played in so masterly
a manner. Tiidu's pipes set everybody's legs dancing. Wherever there was a marriage, a christening,
or a feast of any kind, Tiidu must be there, or the evening would be a failure. In a few years
he had become so noted a piper that people would travel far and wide to hear him.

One day he was invited to a christening where many rich men from the neighbouring town were
present, and all agreed that never in all their lives had they heard such playing as his. They
crowded round him, and praised him, and pressed him to come to their homes, declaring that
it was a shame not to give their friends the chance of hearing such music. Of course all this
delighted Tiidu, who accepted gladly, and left their houses laden with money and presents of
every kind; one great lord clothed him in a magnificent dress, a second hung a chain of pearls
round his neck, while a third handed him a set of new pipes encrusted in silver. As for the
ladies, the girls twisted silken scarves round his plumed hat, and their mothers knitted him
gloves of all colours, to keep out the cold. Any other man in Tiidu's place would have been
contented and happy in this life; but his craving for riches gave him no rest, and only goaded
him day by day to fresh exertions, so that even his own mother would not have known him for
the lazy boy who was always lying asleep in one place or the other.

Now Tiidu saw quite clearly that he could only hope to become rich by means of his pipes, and
set about thinking if there was nothing he could do to make the money flow in faster. At length
he remembered having heard some stories of a kingdom in the Kungla country, where musicians
of all sorts were welcomed and highly paid; but where it was, or how it was reached, he could
not recollect, however hard he thought. In despair, he wandered along the coast, hoping to
see some ship or sailing boat that would take him where he wished to go, and at length he reached
the town of Narva, where several merchantmen were lying at anchor. To his great joy, he found
that one of them was sailing for Kungla in a few days, and he hastily went on board, and asked
for the captain. But the cost of the passage was more than the prudent Tiidu cared to pay,
and though he played his best on his pipes, the captain refused to lower his price, and Tiidu
was just thinking of returning on shore when his usual luck flew to his aid. A young sailor,
who had heard him play, came secretly to him, and offered to hide him on board, in the absence
of the captain. So the next night, as soon as it was dark, Tiidu stepped softly on deck, and
was hidden by his friend down in the hold in a corner between two casks. Unseen by the rest
of the crew the sailor managed to bring him food and drink, and when they were well out of
sight of land he proceeded to carry out a plan he had invented to deliver Tiidu from his cramped
quarters. At midnight, while he was keeping watch and everyone else was sleeping, the man bade
his friend Tiidu follow him on deck, where he tied a rope round Tiidu's body, fastening the
other end carefully to one of the ship's ropes. 'Now,' he said, 'I will throw you into the
sea, and you must shout for help; and when you see the sailors coming untie the rope from your
waist, and tell them that you have swum after the ship all the way from shore.'

At first Tiidu did not much like this scheme, for the sea ran high, but he was a good swimmer,
and the sailor assured him that there was no danger. As soon as he was in the water, his friend
hastened to rouse his mates, declaring that he was sure that there was a man in the sea, following
the ship. They all came on deck, and what was their surprise when they recognised the person
who had bargained about a passage the previous day with the captain.

'Are you a ghost, or a dying man?' they asked him trembling, as they stooped over the side
of the ship.

'I shall soon indeed be a dead man if you do not help me,' answered Tiidu, 'for my strength
is going fast.'

Then the captain seized a rope and flung it out to him, and Tiidu held it between his teeth,
while, unseen by the sailors; he loosed the one tied round his waist.

'Where have you come from?' said the captain, when Tiidu was brought up on board the ship.

'I have followed you from the harbour,' answered he, 'and have been often in sore dread lest
my strength should fail me. I hoped that by swimming after the ship I might at last reach Kungla,
as I had no money to pay my passage.' The captain's heart melted at these words, and he said
kindly: 'You may be thankful that you were not drowned. I will land you at Kungla free of payment,
as you are so anxious to get there. So he gave him dry clothes to wear, and a berth to sleep
in, and Tiidu and his friend secretly made merry over their cunning trick.

For the rest of the voyage the ship's crew treated Tiidu as something higher than themselves,
seeing that in all their lives they had never met with any man that could swim for as many
hours as he had done. This pleased Tiidu very much, though he knew that he had really done
nothing to deserve it, and in return he delighted them by tunes on his pipes. When, after some
days, they cast anchor at Kungla, the story of his wonderful swim brought him many friends,
for everybody wished to hear him tell the tale himself. This might have been all very well,
had not Tiidu lived in dread that some day he would be asked to give proof of his marvellous
swimming powers, and then everything would be found out. Meanwhile he was dazzled with the
splendour around him, and more than ever he longed for part of the riches, about which the
owners seemed to care so little.

He wandered through the streets for many days, seeking some one who wanted a servant; but though
more than one person would have been glad to engage him, they seemed to Tiidu not the sort
of people to help him to get rich quickly. At last, when he had almost made up his mind that
he must accept the next place offered him, he happened to knock at the door of a rich merchant
who was in need of a scullion, and gladly agreed to do the cook's bidding, and it was in this
merchant's house that he first learned how great were the riches of the land of Kungla. All
the vessels which in other countries are made of iron, copper, brass, or tin, in Kungla were
made of silver, or even of gold. The food was cooked in silver saucepans, the bread baked in
a silver oven, while the dishes and their covers were all of gold. Even the very pigs' troughs
were of silver too. But the sight of these things only made Tiidu more covetous than before.
'What is the use of all this wealth that I have constantly before my eyes,' thought he, 'if
none of it is mine? I shall never grow rich by what I earn as a scullion, even though I am
paid as much in a month as I should get elsewhere in a year.'

By this time he had been in his place for two years, and had put by quite a large sum of money.
His passion of saving had increased to such a pitch that it was only by his master's orders
that he ever bought any new clothes, 'For,' said the merchant, 'I will not have dirty people
in my house.' So with a heavy heart Tiidu spent some of his next month's wages on a cheap coat.

One day the merchant held a great feast in honour of the christening of his youngest child,
and he gave each of his servants a handsome garment for the occasion. The following Sunday,
Tiidu, who liked fine clothes when he did not have to pay for them, put on his new coat, and
went for a walk to some beautiful pleasure gardens, which were always full of people on a sunny
day. He sat down under a shady tree, and watched the passers-by, but after a little he began
to feel rather lonely, for he knew nobody and nobody knew him. Suddenly his eyes fell on the
figure of an old man, which seemed familiar to him, though he could not tell when or where
he had seen it. He watched the figure for some time, till at length the old man left the crowded
paths, and threw himself on the soft grass under a lime tree, which stood at some distance
from where Tiidu was sitting. Then the young man walked slowly past, in order that he might
look at him more closely, and as he did so the old man smiled, and held out his hand.

'What have you done with your pipes?' asked he; and then in a moment Tiidu knew him. Taking
his arm he drew him into a quiet place and told him all that had happened since they had last
met. The old man shook his head as he listened, and when Tiidu had finished his tale, he said:
'A fool you are, and a fool you will always be! Was there ever such a piece of folly as to
exchange your pipes for a scullion's ladle? You could have made as much by the pipes in a day
as your wages would have come to in half a year. Go home and fetch your pipes, and play them
here, and you will soon see if I have spoken the truth.'

Tiidu did not like this advice--he was afraid that the people would laugh at him; and, besides,
it was long since he had touched his pipes--but the old man persisted, and at last Tiidu did
as he was told.

'Sit down on the bank by me,' said the old man, when he came back, 'and begin to play, and
in a little while the people will flock round you.' Tiidu obeyed, at first without much heart;
but somehow the tone of the pipes was sweeter than he had remembered, and as he played, the
crowd ceased to walk and chatter, and stood still and silent round him. When he had played
for some time he took off his hat and passed it round, and dollars, and small silver coins,
and even gold pieces, came tumbling in. Tiidu played a couple more tunes by way of thanks,
then turned to go home, hearing on all sides murmurs of 'What a wonderful piper! Come back,
we pray you, next Sunday to give us another treat.'

'What did I tell you?' said the old man, as they passed through the garden gate. 'Was it not
pleasanter to play for a couple of hours on the pipes than to be stirring sauces all day long?
For the second time I have shown you the path to follow; try to learn wisdom, and take the
bull by the horns, lest your luck should slip from you! I can be your guide no longer, therefore
listen to what I say, and obey me. Go every Sunday afternoon to those gardens; and sit under
the lime tree and play to the people, and bring a felt hat with a deep crown, and lay it on
the ground at your feet, so that everyone can throw some money into it. If you are invited
to play at a feast, accept willingly, but beware of asking a fixed price; say you will take
whatever they may feel inclined to give. You will get far more money in the end. Perhaps, some
day, our paths may cross, and then I shall see how far you have followed my advice. Till then,
farewell'; and the old man went his way.

As before, his words came true, though Tiidu could not at once do his bidding, as he had first
to fulfil his appointed time of service. Meanwhile he ordered some fine clothes, in which he
played every Sunday in the gardens, and when he counted his gains in the evening they were
always more than on the Sunday before. At length he was free to do as he liked, and he had
more invitations to play than he could manage to accept, and at night, when the citizens used
to go and drink in the inn, the landlord always begged Tiidu to come and play to them. Thus
he grew so rich that very soon he had his silver pipes covered with gold, so that they glistened
in the light of the sun or the fire. In all Kungla there was no prouder man than Tiidu.

In a few years he had saved such a large sum of money that he was considered a rich man even
in Kungla, where everybody was rich. And then he had leisure to remember that he had once had
a home, and a family, and that he should like to see them both again, and show them how well
he could play. This time he would not need to hide in the ship's hold, but could hire the best
cabin if he wished to, or even have a vessel all to himself. So he packed all his treasures
in large chests, and sent them on board the first ship that was sailing to his native land,
and followed them with a light heart. The wind at starting was fair, but it soon freshened,
and in the night rose to a gale. For two days they ran before it, and hoped that by keeping
well out to sea they might be able to weather the storm, when, suddenly, the ship struck on
a rock, and began to fill. Orders were given to lower the boats, and Tiidu with three sailors
got into one of them, but before they could push away from the ship a huge wave overturned
it, and all four were flung into the water. Luckily for Tiidu an oar was floating near him,
and with its help he was able to keep on the surface of the water; and when the sun rose, and
the mist cleared away, he saw that he was not far from shore. By hard swimming, for the sea
still ran high, he managed to reach it, and pulled himself out of the water, more dead than
alive. Then he flung himself down on the ground and fell fast asleep.

When he awoke he got up to explore the island, and see if there were any men upon it; but though
he found streams and fruit trees in abundance, there was no trace either of man or beast. Then,
tired with his wanderings he sat down and began to think.

For perhaps the first time in his life his thoughts did not instantly turn to money. It was
not on his lost treasures that his mind dwelt, but on his conduct to his parents: his laziness
and disobedience as a boy; his forgetfulness of them as a man. 'If wild animals were to come
and tear me to pieces,' he said to himself bitterly, 'it would be only what I deserve! My gains
are all at the bottom of the sea--well! lightly won, lightly lost--but it is odd that I feel
I should not care for that if only my pipes were left me.' Then he rose and walked a little
further, till he saw a tree with great red apples shining amidst the leaves, and he pulled
some down, and ate them greedily. After that he stretched himself out on the soft moss and
went to sleep.

In the morning he ran to the nearest stream to wash himself, but to his horror, when he caught
sight of his face, he saw his nose had grown the colour of an apple, and reached nearly to
his waist. He started back thinking he was dreaming, and put up his hand; but, alas! the dreadful
thing was true. 'Oh, why does not some wild beast devour me?' he cried to himself; 'never,
never, can I go again amongst my fellow-men! If only the sea had swallowed me up, how much
happier it had been for me!' And he hid his head in his hands and wept. His grief was so violent,
that it exhausted him, and growing hungry he looked about for something to eat. Just above
him was a bough of ripe, brown nuts, end he picked them and ate a handful. To his surprise,
as he was eating them, he felt his nose grow shorter and shorter, and after a while he ventured
to feel it with his hand, and even to look in the stream again! Yes, there was no mistake,
it was as short as before, or perhaps a little shorter. In his joy at this discovery Tiidu
did a very bold thing. He took one of the apples out of his pocket, and cautiously bit a piece
out of it. In an instant his nose was as long as his chin, and in a deadly fear lest it should
stretch further, he hastily swallowed a nut, and awaited the result with terror. Supposing
that the shrinking of his nose had only been an accident before! Supposing that that nut and
no other was able to cause its shrinking! In that case he had, by his own folly, in not letting
well alone, ruined his life completely. But, no! he had guessed rightly, for in no more time
than his nose had taken to grow long did it take to return to its proper size. 'This may make
my fortune,' he said joyfully to himself; and he gathered some of the apples, which he put
into one pocket, and a good supply of nuts which he put into the other. Next day he wove a
basket out of some rushes, so that if he ever left the island he might be able to carry his
treasures about.

That night he dreamed that his friend the old man appeared to him and said: 'Because you did
not mourn for your lost treasure, but only for your pipes, I will give you a new set to replace
them.' And, behold! in the morning when he got up a set of pipes was lying in the basket. With
what joy did he seize them and begin one of his favourite tunes; and as he played hope sprang
up in his heart, and he looked out to sea, to try to detect the sign of a sail. Yes! there
it was, making straight for the island; and Tiidu, holding his pipes in his hand, dashed down
to the shore.

The sailors knew the island to be uninhabited, and were much surprised to see a man standing
on the beach, waving his arms in welcome to them. A boat was put off, and two sailors rowed
to the shore to discover how he came there, and if he wished to be taken away. Tiidu told them
the story of his shipwreck, and the captain promised that he should come on board, and sail
with them back to Kungla; and thankful indeed was Tiidu to accept the offer, and to show his
gratitude by playing on his pipes whenever he was asked to do so.

They had a quick voyage, and it was not long before Tiidu found himself again in the streets
of the capital of Kungla, playing as he went along. The people had heard no music like his
since he went away, and they crowded round him, and in their joy gave him whatever money they
had in their pockets. His first care was to buy himself some new clothes, which he sadly needed,
taking care, however, that they should be made after a foreign fashion. When they were ready,
he set out one day with a small basket of his famous apples, and went up to the palace. He
did not have to wait long before one of the royal servants passed by and bought all the apples,
begging as he did so that the merchant should return and bring some more. This Tiidu promised,
and hastened away as if he had a mad bull behind him, so afraid was he that the man should
begin to eat an apple at once.

It is needless to say that for some days he took no more apples back to the palace, but kept
well away on the other side of the town, wearing other clothes, and disguised by a long black
beard, so that even his own mother would not have known him.

The morning after his visit to the castle the whole city was in an uproar about the dreadful
misfortune that had happened to the Royal Family, for not only the king but his wife and children,
had eaten of the stranger's apples, and all, so said the rumour, were very ill. The most famous
doctors and the greatest magicians were hastily summoned to the palace, but they shook their
heads and came away again; never had they met with such a disease in all the course of their
experience. By-and-bye a story went round the town, started no one knew how, that the malady
was in some way connected with the nose; and men rubbed their own anxiously, to be sure that
nothing catching was in the air.

Matters had been in this state for more than a week when it reached the ears of the king that
a man was living in an inn on the other side of the town who declared himself able to cure
all manner of diseases. Instantly the royal carriage was commanded to drive with all speed
and bring back this magician, offering him riches untold if he could restore their noses to
their former length. Tiidu had expected this summons, and had sat up all night changing his
appearance, and so well had he succeeded that not a trace remained either of the piper or of
the apple seller. He stepped into the carriage, and was driven post haste to the king, who
was feverishly counting every moment, for both his nose and the queen's were by this time more
than a yard long, and they did not know where they would stop.

Now Tiidu thought it would not look well to cure the royal family by giving them the raw nuts;
he felt that it might arouse suspicion. So he had carefully pounded them into a powder, and
divided the powder up into small doses, which were to be put on the tongue and swallowed at
once. He gave one of these to the king and another to the queen, and told them that before
taking them they were to get into bed in a dark room and not to move for some hours, after
which they might be sure that they would come out cured.

The king's joy was so great at this news that he would gladly have given Tiidu half of his
kingdom; but the piper was no longer so greedy of money as he once was, before he had been
shipwrecked on the island. If he could get enough to buy a small estate and live comfortably
on it for the rest of his life, that was all he now cared for. However, the king ordered his
treasure to pay him three times as much as he asked, and with this Tiidu went down to the harbour
and engaged a small ship to carry him back to his native country. The wind was fair, and in
ten days the coast, which he had almost forgotten, stood clear before him. In a few hours he
was standing in his old home, where his father, three sisters, and two brothers gave him a
hearty welcome. His mother and his other brothers had died some years before.

When the meeting was over, he began to make inquiries about a small estate that was for sale
near the town, and after he had bought it the next thing was to find a wife to share it with
him. This did not take long either; and people who were at the wedding feast declared that
the best part of the whole day was the hour when Tiidu played to them on the pipes before they
bade each other farewell and returned to their homes.

Paperarelloo

Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen who had one son. The king loved the boy very
much, but the queen, who was a wicked woman, hated the sight of him; and this was the more
unlucky for, when he was twelve years old, his father died, and he was left alone in the world.

Now the queen was very angry because the people, who knew how bad she was, seated her son on
the throne instead of herself, and she never rested till she had formed a plan to get him out
of the way. Fortunately, however, the young king was wise and prudent, and knew her too well
to trust her.

One day, when his mourning was over, he gave orders that everything should be made ready for
a grand hunt. The queen pretended to be greatly delighted that he was going to amuse himself
once more, and declared that she would accompany him. 'No, mother, I cannot let you come,'
he answered; 'the ground is rough, and you are not strong.' But he might as well have spoken
to the winds: when the horn was sounded at daybreak the queen was there with the rest.

All that day they rode, for game was plentiful, but towards evening the mother and son found
themselves alone in a part of the country that was strange to them. They wandered on for some
time, without knowing where they were going, till they met with a man whom they begged to give
them shelter. 'Come with me,' said the man gladly, for he was an ogre, and fed on human flesh;
and the king and his mother went with him, and he led them to his house. When they got there
they found to what a dreadful place they had come, and, falling on their knees, they offered
him great sums of money, if he would only spare their lives. The ogre's heart was moved at
the sight of the queen's beauty, and he promised that he would do her no harm; but he stabbed
the boy at once, and binding his body on a horse, turned him loose in the forest.

The ogre had happened to choose a horse which he had bought only the day before, and he did
not know it was a magician, or he would not have been so foolish as to fix upon it on this
occasion. The horse no sooner had been driven off with the prince's body on its back than it
galloped straight to the home of the fairies, and knocked at the door with its hoof. The fairies
heard the knock, but were afraid to open till they had peeped from an upper window to see that
it was no giant or ogre who could do them harm. 'Oh, look, sister!' cried the first to reach
the window, 'it is a horse that has knocked, and on its back there is bound a dead boy, the
most beautiful boy in all the world!' Then the fairies ran to open the door, and let in the
horse and unbound the ropes which fastened the young king on its back. And they gathered round
to admire his beauty, and whispered one to the other: 'We will make him alive again, and will
keep him for our brother.' And so they did, and for many years they all lived together as brothers
and sisters.

By-and-by the boy grew into a man, as boys will, and then the oldest of the fairies said to
her sisters: 'Now I will marry him, and he shall be really your brother.' So the young king
married the fairy, and they lived happily together in the castle; but though he loved his wife
he still longed to see the world.

At length this longing grew so strong on him that he could bear it no more; and, calling the
fairies together, he said to them: 'Dear wife and sisters, I must leave you for a time, and
go out and see the world. But I shall think of you often, and one day I shall come back to you.'

The fairies wept and begged him to stay, but he would not listen, and at last the eldest, who
was his wife, said to him: 'If you really will abandon us, take this lock of my hair with you;
you will find it useful in time of need.' So she cut off a long curl, and handed it to him.

The prince mounted his horse, and rode on all day without stopping once. Towards evening he
found himself in a desert, and, look where he would, there was no such thing as a house or
a man to be seen. 'What am I to do now?' he thought. 'If I go to sleep here wild beasts will
come and eat me! Yet both I and my horse are worn out, and can go no further.' Then suddenly
he remembered the fairy's gift, and taking out the curl he said to it: 'I want a castle here,
and servants, and dinner, and everything to make me comfortable tonight; and besides that,
I must have a stable and fodder for my horse.' And in a moment the castle was before him just
as he had wished.

In this way he travelled through many countries, till at last he came to a land that was ruled
over by a great king. Leaving his horse outside the walls, he clad himself in the dress of
a poor man, and went up to the palace. The queen, who was looking out of the window, saw him
approaching, and filled with pity sent a servant to ask who he was and what he wanted. 'I am
a stranger here,' answered the young king, 'and very poor. I have come to beg for some work.'
'We have everybody we want,' said the queen, when the servant told her the young man's reply.
'We have a gate-keeper, and a hall porter, and servants of all sorts in the palace; the only
person we have not got is a goose-boy. Tell him that he can be our goose-boy if he likes.'
The youth answered that he was quite content to be goose-boy; and that was how he got his nickname
of Paperarello. And in order that no one should guess that he was any better than a goose-boy
should be, he rubbed his face and his rags over with mud, and made himself altogether such
a disgusting object that every one crossed over to the other side of the road when he was seen
coming.

'Do go and wash yourself, Paperarello!' said the queen sometimes, for he did his work so well
that she took an interest in him. 'Oh, I should not feel comfortable if I was clean, your Majesty,'
answered he, and went whistling after his geese.

It happened one day that, owing to some accident to the great flour mills which supplied the
city, there was no bread to be had, and the king's army had to do without. When the king heard
of it, he sent for the cook, and told him that by the next morning he must have all the bread
that the oven, heated seven times over, could bake. 'But, your Majesty, it is not possible,'
cried the poor man in despair. 'The mills have only just begun working, and the flour will
not be ground till evening, and how can I heat the oven seven times in one night?' 'That is
your affair,' answered the King, who, when he took anything into his head, would listen to
nothing. 'If you succeed in baking the bread you shall have my daughter to wife, but if you
fail your head will pay for it.'

Now Paperarello, who was passing through the hall where the king was giving his orders, heard
these words, and said: 'Your Majesty, have no fears; I will bake your bread.' 'Very well,'
answered the king; 'but if you fail, you will pay for it with your head!' and signed that both
should leave his presence.

The cook was still trembling with the thought of what he had escaped, but to his surprise Paperarello
did not seem disturbed at all, and when night came he went to sleep as usual. 'Paperarello,'
cried the other servants, when they saw him quietly taking off his clothes, 'you cannot go
to bed; you will need every moment of the night for your work. Remember, the king is not to
be played with!'

'I really must have some sleep first,' replied Paperarello, stretching himself and yawning;
and he flung himself on his bed, and was fast asleep in a moment. In an hour's time, the servants
came and shook him by the shoulder. 'Paperarello, are you mad?' said they. 'Get up, or you
will lose your head.' 'Oh, do let me sleep a little more, answered he. And this was all he
would say, though the servants returned to wake him many times in the night.

At last the dawn broke, and the servants rushed to his room, crying: 'Paperarello! Paperarello!
get up, the king is coming. You have baked no bread, and of a surety he will have your head.'

'Oh, don't scream so,' replied Paperarello, jumping out of bed as he spoke; and taking the
lock of hair in his hand, he went into the kitchen. And, behold! there stood the bread piled
high--four, five, six ovens full, and the seventh still waiting to be taken out of the oven.
The servants stood and stared in surprise, and the king said: 'Well done, Paperarello, you
have won my daughter.' And he thought to himself: 'This fellow must really be a magician.'

But when the princess heard what was in store for her she wept bitterly, and declared that
never, never would she marry that dirty Paperarello! However, the king paid no heed to her
tears and prayers, and before many days were over the wedding was celebrated with great splendour,
though the bridegroom had not taken the trouble to wash himself, and was as dirty as before.

When night came he went as usual to sleep among his geese, and the princess went to the king
and said: 'Father, I entreat you to have that horrible Paperarello put to death.' 'No, no!'
replied her father, 'he is a great magician, and before I put him to death, I must first find
out the secret of his power, and then--we shall see.'

Soon after this a war broke out, and everybody about the palace was very busy polishing up
armour and sharpening swords, for the king and his sons were to ride at the head of the army.
Then Paperarello left his geese, and came and told the king that he wished to go to fight also.
The king gave him leave, and told him that he might go to the stable and take any horse he
liked from the stables. So Paperarello examined the horses carefully, but instead of picking
out one of the splendid well-groomed creatures, whose skin shone like satin, he chose a poor
lame thing, put a saddle on it, and rode after the other men-at-arms who were attending the
king. In a short time he stopped, and said to them: 'My horse can go no further; you must go
on to the war without me, and I will stay here, and make some little clay soldiers, and will
play at a battle.' The men laughed at him for being so childish, and rode on after their master.

Scarcely were they out of sight than Paperarello took out his curl, and wished himself the
best armour, the sharpest sword, and the swiftest horse in the world, and the next minute was
riding as fast as he could to the field of battle. The fight had already begun, and the enemy
was getting the best of it, when Paperarello rode up, and in a moment the fortunes of the day
had changed. Right and left this strange knight laid about him, and his sword pierced the stoutest
breast-plate, and the strongest shield. He was indeed 'a host in himself,' and his foes fled
before him thinking he was only the first of a troop of such warriors, whom no one could withstand.
When the battle was over, the king sent for him to thank him for his timely help, and to ask
what reward he should give him. 'Nothing but your little finger, your Majesty,' was his answer;
and the king cut off his little finger and gave it to Paperarello, who bowed and hid it in
his surcoat. Then he left the field, and when the soldiers rode back they found him still sitting
in the road making whole rows of little clay dolls.

The next day the king went out to fight another battle, and again Paperarello appeared, mounted
on his lame horse. As on the day before, he halted on the road, and sat down to make his clay
soldiers; then a second time he wished himself armour, sword, and a horse, all sharper and
better than those he had previously had, and galloped after the rest. He was only just in time:
the enemy had almost beaten the king's army back, and men whispered to each other that if the
strange knight did not soon come to their aid, they would be all dead men. Suddenly someone
cried: 'Hold on a little longer, I see him in the distance; and his armour shines brighter,
and his horse runs swifter, than yesterday.' Then they took fresh heart and fought desperately
on till the knight came up, and threw himself into the thick of the battle. As before, the
enemy gave way before him, and in a few minutes the victory remained with the king.

The first thing that the victor did was to send for the knight to thank him for his timely
help, and to ask what gift he could bestow on him in token of gratitude. 'Your Majesty's ear,'
answered the knight; and as the king could not go back from his word, he cut it off and gave
it to him. Paperarello bowed, fastened the ear inside his surcoat and rode away. In the evening,
when they all returned from the battle, there he was, sitting in the road, making clay dolls.

On the third day the same thing happened, and this time he asked for the king's nose as the
reward of his aid. Now, to lose one's nose, is worse even than losing one's ear or one's finger,
and the king hesitated as to whether he should comply. However, he had always prided himself
on being an honourable man, so he cut off his nose, and handed it to Paperarello. Paperarello
bowed, put the nose in his surcoat, and rode away. In the evening, when the king returned from
the battle, he found Paperarello sitting in the road making clay dolls. And Paperarello got
up and said to him: 'Do you know who I am? I am your dirty goose-boy, yet you have given me
your finger, and your ear, and your nose.'

That night, when the king sat at dinner, Paperarello came in, and laying down the ear, and
the nose, and the finger on the table, turned and said to the nobles and courtiers who were
waiting on the king: 'I am the invincible knight, who rode three times to your help, and I
also am a king's son, and no goose-boy as you all think.' And he went away and washed himself,
and dressed himself in fine clothes and entered the hall again, looking so handsome that the
proud princess fell in love with him on the spot. But Paperarello took no notice of her, and
said to the king: 'It was kind of you to offer me your daughter in marriage, and for that I
thank you; but I have a wife at home whom I love better, and it is to her that I am going.
But as a token of farewell, I wish that your ear, and nose, and finger may be restored to their
proper places.' So saying, he bade them all goodbye, and went back to his home and his fairy
bride, with whom he lived happily till the end of his life.

The Gifts Of The Magician

Once upon a time there was an old man who lived in a little hut in the middle of a forest.
His wife was dead, and he had only one son, whom he loved dearly. Near their hut was a group
of birch trees, in which some black-game had made their nests, and the youth had often begged
his father's permission to shoot the birds, but the old man always strictly forbade him to
do anything of the kind.

One day, however, when the father had gone to a little distance to collect some sticks for
the fire, the boy fetched his bow, and shot at a bird that was just flying towards its nest.
But he had not taken proper aim, and the bird was only wounded, and fluttered along the ground.
The boy ran to catch it, but though he ran very fast, and the bird seemed to flutter along
very slowly, he never could quite come up with it; it was always just a little in advance.
But so absorbed was he in the chase that he did not notice for some time that he was now deep
in the forest, in a place where he had never been before. Then he felt it would be foolish
to go any further, and he turned to find his way home.

He thought it would be easy enough to follow the path along which he had come, but somehow
it was always branching off in unexpected directions. He looked about for a house where he
might stop and ask his way, but there was not a sign of one anywhere, and he was afraid to
stand still, for it was cold, and there were many stories of wolves being seen in that part
of the forest. Night fell, and he was beginning to start at every sound, when suddenly a magician
came running towards him, with a pack of wolves snapping at his heels. Then all the boy's courage
returned to him. He took his bow, and aiming an arrow at the largest wolf, shot him through
the heart, and a few more arrows soon put the rest to flight. The magician was full of gratitude
to his deliverer, and promised him a reward for his help if the youth would go back with him
to his house.

'Indeed there is nothing that would be more welcome to me than a night's lodging,' answered
the boy; 'I have been wandering all day in the forest, and did not know how to get home again.

'Come with me, you must be hungry as well as tired,' said the magician, and led the way to
his house, where the guest flung himself on a bed, and went fast asleep. But his host returned
to the forest to get some food, for the larder was empty.

While he was absent the housekeeper went to the boy's room and tried to wake him. She stamped
on the floor, and shook him and called to him, telling him that he was in great danger, and
must take flight at once. But nothing would rouse him, and if he did ever open his eyes he
shut them again directly.

Soon after, the magician came back from the forest, and told the housekeeper to bring them
something to eat. The meal was quickly ready, and the magician called to the boy to come down
and eat it, but he could not be wakened, and they had to sit down to supper without him. By-and-by
the magician went out into the wood again for some more hunting, and on his return he tried
afresh to waken the youth. But finding it quite impossible, he went back for the third time
to the forest.

While he was absent the boy woke up and dressed himself. Then he came downstairs and began
to talk to the housekeeper. The girl had heard how he had saved her master's life, so she said
nothing more about his running away, but instead told him that if the magician offered him
the choice of a reward, he was to ask for the horse which stood in the third stall of the stable.

By-and-by the old man came back and they all sat down to dinner. When they had finished the
magician said: 'Now, my son, tell me what you will have as the reward of your courage?'

'Give me the horse that stands in the third stall of your stable,' answered the youth. 'For
I have a long way to go before I get home, and my feet will not carry me so far.'

'Ah! my son,' replied the magician, 'it is the best horse in my stable that you want! Will
not anything else please you as well?'

But the youth declared that it was the horse, and the horse only, that he desired, and in the
end the old man gave way. And besides the horse, the magician gave him a zither, a fiddle,
and a flute, saying: 'If you are in danger, touch the zither; and if no one comes to your aid,
then play on the fiddle; but if that brings no help, blow on the flute.'

The youth thanked the magician, and fastening his treasures about him mounted the horse and
rode off. He had already gone some miles when, to his great surprise, the horse spoke, and
said: 'It is no use your returning home just now, your father will only beat you. Let us visit
a few towns first, and something lucky will be sure to happen to us.'

This advice pleased the boy, for he felt himself almost a man by this time, and thought it
was high time he saw the world. When they entered the capital of the country everyone stopped
to admire the beauty of the horse. Even the king heard of it, and came to see the splendid
creature with his own eyes. Indeed, he wanted directly to buy it, and told the youth he would
give any price he liked. The young man hesitated for a moment, but before he could speak, the
horse contrived to whisper to him:

'Do not sell me, but ask the king to take me to his stable, and feed me there; then his other
horses will become just as beautiful as I.'

The king was delighted when he was told what the horse had said, and took the animal at once
to the stables, and placed it in his own particular stall. Sure enough, the horse had scarcely
eaten a mouthful of corn out of the manger, when the rest of the horses seemed to have undergone
a transformation. Some of them were old favourites which the king had ridden in many wars,
and they bore the signs of age and of service. But now they arched their heads, and pawed the
ground with their slender legs as they had been wont to do in days long gone by. The king's
heart beat with delight, but the old groom who had had the care of them stood crossly by, and
eyed the owner of this wonderful creature with hate and envy. Not a day passed without his
bringing some story against the youth to his master, but the king understood all about the
matter and paid no attention. At last the groom declared that the young man had boasted that
he could find the king's war horse which had strayed into the forest several years ago, and
had not been heard of since. Now the king had never ceased to mourn for his horse, so this
time he listened to the tale which the groom had invented, and sent for the youth. 'Find me
my horse in three days,' said he, 'or it will be the worse for you.'

The youth was thunderstruck at this command, but he only bowed, and went off at once to the stable.

'Do not worry yourself,' answered his own horse. 'Ask the king to give you a hundred oxen,
and to let them be killed and cut into small pieces. Then we will start on our journey, and
ride till we reach a certain river. There a horse will come up to you, but take no notice of
him. Soon another will appear, and this also you must leave alone, but when the third horse
shows itself, throw my bridle over it.'

Everything happened just as the horse had said, and the third horse was safely bridled. Then
the other horse spoke again: 'The magician's raven will try to eat us as we ride away, but
throw it some of the oxen's flesh, and then I will gallop like the wind, and carry you safe
out of the dragon's clutches.'

So the young man did as he was told, and brought the horse back to the king.

The old stableman was very jealous, when he heard of it, and wondered what he could do to injure
the youth in the eyes of his royal master. At last he hit upon a plan, and told the king that
the young man had boasted that he could bring home the king's wife, who had vanished many months
before, without leaving a trace behind her. Then the king bade the young man come into his
presence, and desired him to fetch the queen home again, as he had boasted he could do. And
if he failed, his head would pay the penalty.

The poor youth's heart stood still as he listened. Find the queen? But how was he to do that,
when nobody in the palace had been able to do so! Slowly he walked to the stable, and laying
his head on his horse's shoulder, he said: 'The king has ordered me to bring his wife home
again, and how can I do that when she disappeared so long ago, and no one can tell me anything
about her?'

'Cheer up!' answered the horse, 'we will manage to find her. You have only got to ride me back
to the same river that we went to yesterday, and I will plunge into it and take my proper shape
again. For I am the king's wife, who was turned into a horse by the magician from whom you
saved me.'

Joyfully the young man sprang into the saddle and rode away to the banks of the river. Then
he threw himself off, and waited while the horse plunged in. The moment it dipped its head
into the water its black skin vanished, and the most beautiful woman in the world was floating
on the water. She came smiling towards the youth, and held out her hand, and he took it and
led her back to the palace. Great was the king's surprise and happiness when he beheld his
lost wife stand before him, and in gratitude to her rescuer he loaded him with gifts.

You would have thought that after this the poor youth would have been left in peace; but no,
his enemy the stableman hated him as much as ever, and laid a new plot for his undoing. This
time he presented himself before the king and told him that the youth was so puffed up with
what he had done that he had declared he would seize the king's throne for himself.

At this news the king waxed so furious that he ordered a gallows to be erected at once, and
the young man to be hanged without a trial. He was not even allowed to speak in his own defence,
but on the very steps of the gallows he sent a message to the king and begged, as a last favour,
that he might play a tune on his zither. Leave was given him, and taking the instrument from
under his cloak he touched the strings. Scarcely had the first notes sounded than the hangman
and his helper began to dance, and the louder grew the music the higher they capered, till
at last they cried for mercy. But the youth paid no heed, and the tunes rang out more merrily
than before, and by the time the sun set they both sank on the ground exhausted, and declared
that the hanging must be put off till to-morrow.

The story of the zither soon spread through the town, and on the following morning the king
and his whole court and a large crowd of people were gathered at the foot of the gallows to
see the youth hanged. Once more he asked a favour--permission to play on his fiddle, and this
the king was graciously pleased to grant. But with the first notes, the leg of every man in
the crowd was lifted high, and they danced to the sound of the music the whole day till darkness
fell, and there was no light to hang the musician by.

The third day came, and the youth asked leave to play on his flute. 'No, no,' said the king,
'you made me dance all day yesterday, and if I do it again it will certainly be my death. You
shall play no more tunes. Quick! the rope round his neck.'

At these words the young man looked so sorrowful that the courtiers said to the king: 'He is
very young to die. Let him play a tune if it will make him happy.' So, very unwillingly, the
king gave him leave; but first he had himself bound to a big fir tree, for fear that he should
be made to dance.

When he was made fast, the young man began to blow softly on his flute, and bound though he
was, the king's body moved to the sound, up and down the fir tree till his clothes were in
tatters, and the skin nearly rubbed off his back. But the youth had no pity, and went on blowing,
till suddenly the old magician appeared and asked: 'What danger are you in, my son, that you
have sent for me?'

'They want to hang me,' answered the young man; 'the gallows are all ready and the hangman
is only waiting for me to stop playing.'

'Oh, I will put that right,' said the magician; and taking the gallows, he tore it up and flung
it into the air, and no one knows where it came down. 'Who has ordered you to be hanged?' asked he.

The young man pointed to the king, who was still bound to the fir; and without wasting words
the magician took hold of the tree also, and with a mighty heave both fir and man went spinning
through the air, and vanished in the clouds after the gallows.

Then the youth was declared to be free, and the people elected him for their king; and the
stable helper drowned himself from envy, for, after all, if it had not been for him the young
man would have remained poor all the days of his life.

The Strong Prince

Once upon a time there lived a king who was so fond of wine that he could not go to sleep unless
he knew he had a great flaskful tied to his bed-post. All day long he drank till he was too
stupid to attend to his business, and everything in the kingdom went to rack and ruin. But
one day an accident happened to him, and he was struck on the head by a falling bough, so that
he fell from his horse and lay dead upon the ground.

His wife and son mourned his loss bitterly, for, in spite of his faults, he had always been
kind to them. So they abandoned the crown and forsook their country, not knowing or caring
where they went.

At length they wandered into a forest, and being very tired, sat down under a tree to eat some
bread that they had brought with them. When they had finished the queen said: 'My son, I am
thirsty; fetch me some water.'

The prince got up at once and went to a brook which he heard gurgling near at hand. He stooped
and filled his hat with the water, which he brought to his mother; then he turned and followed
the stream up to its source in a rock, where it bubbled out clear and fresh and cold. He knelt
down to take a draught from the deep pool below the rock, when he saw the reflection of a sword
hanging from the branch of a tree over his head. The young man drew back with a start; but
in a moment he climbed the tree, cutting the rope which held the sword, and carried the weapon
to his mother.

The queen was greatly surprised at the sight of anything so splendid in such a lonely place,
and took it in her hands to examine it closely. It was of curious workmanship, wrought with
gold, and on its handle was written: 'The man who can buckle on this sword will become stronger
than other men.' The queen's heart swelled with joy as she read these words, and she bade her
son lose no time in testing their truth. So he fastened it round his waist, and instantly a
glow of strength seemed to run through his veins. He took hold of a thick oak tree and rooted
it up as easily as if it had been a weed.

This discovery put new life into the queen and her son, and they continued their walk through
the forest. But night was drawing on, and the darkness grew so thick that it seemed as if it
could be cut with a knife. They did not want to sleep in the wood, for they were afraid of
wolves and other wild beasts, so they groped their way along, hand in hand, till the prince
tripped over something which lay across the path. He could not see what it was, but stooped
down and tried to lift it. The thing was very heavy, and he thought his back would break under
the strain. At last with a great heave he moved it out of the road, and as it fell he knew
it was a huge rock. Behind the rock was a cave which it was quite clear was the home of some
robbers, though not one of the band was there.

Hastily putting out the fire which burned brightly at the back, and bidding his mother come
in and keep very still, the prince began to pace up and down, listening for the return of the
robbers. But he was very sleepy, and in spite of all his efforts he felt he could not keep
awake much longer, when he heard the sound of the robbers returning, shouting and singing as
they marched along. Soon the singing ceased, and straining his ears he heard them discussing
anxiously what had become of their cave, and why they could not see the fire as usual. 'This
must be the place,' said a voice, which the prince took to be that of the captain. 'Yes, I
feel the ditch before the entrance. Someone forgot to pile up the fire before we left and it
has burnt itself out! But it is all right. Let every man jump across, and as he does so cry
out "Hop! I am here." I will go last. Now begin.'

The man who stood nearest jumped across, but he had no time to give the call which the captain
had ordered, for with one swift, silent stroke of the prince's sword, his head rolled into
a corner. Then the young man cried instead, 'Hop! I am here.'

The second man, hearing the signal, leapt the ditch in confidence, and was met by the same
fate, and in a few minutes eleven of the robbers lay dead, and there remained only the captain.

Now the captain had wound round his neck the shawl of his lost wife, and the stroke of the
prince's sword fell harmless. Being very cunning, however, he made no resistance, and rolled
over as if he were as dead as the other men. Still, the prince was no fool, and wondered if
indeed he was as dead as he seemed to be; but the captain lay so stiff and stark, that at last
he was taken in.

The prince next dragged the headless bodies into a chamber in the cave, and locked the door.
Then he and his mother ransacked the place for some food, and when they had eaten it they lay
down and slept in peace.

With the dawn they were both awake again, and found that, instead of the cave which they had
come to the night before, they now were in a splendid castle, full of beautiful rooms. The
prince went round all these and carefully locked them up, bidding his mother take care of the
keys while he was hunting.

Unfortunately, the queen, like all women, could not bear to think that there was anything which
she did not know. So the moment that her son had turned his back, she opened the doors of all
the rooms, and peeped in, till she came to the one where the robbers lay. But if the sight
of the blood on the ground turned her faint, the sight of the robber captain walking up and
down was a greater shock still. She quickly turned the key in the lock, and ran back to the
chamber she had slept in.

Soon after her son came in, bringing with him a large bear, which he had killed for supper.
As there was enough food to last them for many days, the prince did not hunt the next morning,
but, instead, began to explore the castle. He found that a secret way led from it into the
forest; and following the path, he reached another castle larger and more splendid than the
one belonging to the robbers. He knocked at the door with his fist, and said that he wanted
to enter; but the giant, to whom the castle belonged, only answered: 'I know who you are. I
have nothing to do with robbers.'

'I am no robber,' answered the prince. 'I am the son of a king, and I have killed all the band.
If you do not open to me at once I will break in the door, and your head shall go to join the
others.'

He waited a little, but the door remained shut as tightly as before. Then he just put his shoulder
to it, and immediately the wood began to crack. When the giant found that it was no use keeping
it shut, he opened it, saying: 'I see you are a brave youth. Let there be peace between us.'

And the prince was glad to make peace, for he had caught a glimpse of the giant's beautiful
daughter, and from that day he often sought the giant's house.

Now the queen led a dull life all alone in the castle, and to amuse herself she paid visits
to the robber captain, who flattered her till at last she agreed to marry him. But as she was
much afraid of her son, she told the robber that the next time the prince went to bathe in
the river, he was to steal the sword from its place above the bed, for without it the young
man would have no power to punish him for his boldness.

The robber captain thought this good counsel, and the next morning, when the young man went
to bathe, he unhooked the sword from its nail and buckled it round his waist. On his return
to the castle, the prince found the robber waiting for him on the steps, waving the sword above
his head, and knowing that some horrible fate was in store, fell on his knees and begged for
mercy. But he might as well have tried to squeeze blood out of a stone. The robber, indeed,
granted him his life, but took out both his eyes, which he thrust into the prince's hand, saying
brutally:

'Here, you had better keep them! You may find them useful!'

Weeping, the blind youth felt his way to the giant's house, and told him all the story.

The giant was full of pity for the poor young man, but inquired anxiously what he had done
with the eyes. The prince drew them out of his pocket, and silently handed them to the giant,
who washed them well, and then put them back in the prince's head. For three days he lay in
utter darkness; then the light began to come back, till soon he saw as well as ever.

But though he could not rejoice enough over the recovery of his eyes, he bewailed bitterly
the loss of his sword, and that it should have fallen to the lot of his bitter enemy.

'Never mind, my friend,' said the giant, 'I will get it back for you.' And he sent for the
monkey who was his head servant.

'Tell the fox and the squirrel that they are to go with you, and fetch me back the prince's
sword,' ordered he.

The three servants set out at once, one seated on the back of the others, the ape, who disliked
walking, being generally on top. Directly they came to the window of the robber captain's room,
the monkey sprang from the backs of the fox and the squirrel, and climbed in. The room was
empty, and the sword hanging from a nail. He took it down, and buckling it round his waist,
as he had seen the prince do, swung himself down again, and mounting on the backs of his two
companions, hastened to his master. The giant bade him give the sword to the prince, who girded
himself with it, and returned with all speed to the castle.

'Come out, you rascal! come out, you villain!' cried he, 'and answer to me for the wrong you
have done. I will show you who is the master in this house!'

The noise he made brought the robber into the room. He glanced up to where the sword usually
hung, but it was gone; and instinctively he looked at the prince's hand, where he saw it gleaming
brightly. In his turn he fell on his knees to beg for mercy, but it was too late. As he had
done to the prince, so the prince did to him, and, blinded, he was thrust forth, and fell down
a deep hole, where he is to this day. His mother the prince sent back to her father, and never
would see her again. After this he returned to the giant, and said to him:

'My friend, add one more kindness to those you have already heaped on me. Give me your daughter
as my wife.'

So they were married, and the wedding feast was so splendid that there was not a kingdom in
the world that did not hear of it. And the prince never went back to his father's throne, but
lived peacefully with his wife in the forest, where, if they are not dead, they are living still.

[From Ungarische Volksmarchen.]

The Treasure Seeker

Once, long ago, in a little town that lay in the midst of high hills and wild forests, a party
of shepherds sat one night in the kitchen of the inn talking over old times, and telling of
the strange things that had befallen them in their youth.

Presently up spoke the silver-haired Father Martin.

'Comrades,' said he, 'you have had wonderful adventures; but I will tell you something still
more astonishing that happened to myself. When I was a young lad I had no home and no one to
care for me, and I wandered from village to village all over the country with my knapsack on
my back; but as soon as I was old enough I took service with a shepherd in the mountains, and
helped him for three years. One autumn evening as we drove the flock homeward ten sheep were
missing, and the master bade me go and seek them in the forest. I took my dog with me, but
he could find no trace of them, though we searched among the bushes till night fell; and then,
as I did not know the country and could not find my way home in the dark, I decided to sleep
under a tree. At midnight my dog became uneasy, and began to whine and creep close to me with
his tail between his legs; by this I knew that something was wrong, and, looking about, I saw
in the bright moonlight a figure standing beside me. It seemed to be a man with shaggy hair,
and a long beard which hung down to his knees. He had a garland upon his head, and a girdle
of oak-leaves about his body, and carried an uprooted fir-tree in his right hand. I shook like
an aspen leaf at the sight, and my spirit quaked for fear. The strange being beckoned with
his hand that I should follow him; but as I did not stir from the spot he spoke in a hoarse,
grating voice: "Take courage, fainthearted shepherd. I am the Treasure Seeker of the mountain.
If you will come with me you shall dig up much gold."

'Though I was still deadly cold with terror I plucked up my courage and said: "Get away from
me, evil spirit; I do not desire your treasures."

'At this the spectre grinned in my face and cried mockingly:

'"Simpleton! Do you scorn your good fortune? Well, then, remain a ragamuffin all your days."

'He turned as if to go away from me, then came back again and said: "Bethink yourself, bethink
yourself, rogue. I will fill your knapsack--I will fill your pouch."

'"Away from me, monster," I answered, "I will have nothing to do with you."

'When the apparition saw that I gave no heed to him he ceased to urge me, saying only: "Some
day you will rue this," and looked at me sadly. Then he cried: "Listen to what I say, and lay
it well to heart, it may be of use to you when you come to your senses. A vast treasure of
gold and precious stones lies in safety deep under the earth. At twilight and at high noon
it is hidden, but at midnight it may be dug up. For seven hundred years have I watched over
it, but now my time has come; it is common property, let him find it who can. So I thought
to give it into your hand, having a kindness for you because you feed your flock upon my mountain."

'Thereupon the spectre told me exactly where the treasure lay, and how to find it. It might
be only yesterday so well do I remember every word he spoke.

'"Go towards the little mountains," said he, "and ask there for the Black King's Valley, and
when you come to a tiny brook follow the stream till you reach the stone bridge beside the
saw-mill. Do not cross the bridge, but keep to your right along the bank till a high rock stands
before you. A bow-shot from that you will discover a little hollow like a grave. When you find
this hollow dig it out; but it will be hard work, for the earth has been pressed down into
it with care. Still, work away till you find solid rock on all sides of you, and soon you will
come to a square slab of stone; force it out of the wall, and you will stand at the entrance
of the treasure house. Into this opening you must crawl, holding a lamp in your mouth. Keep
your hands free lest you knock your nose against a stone, for the way is steep and the stones
sharp. If it bruises your knees never mind; you are on the road to fortune. Do not rest till
you reach a wide stairway, down which you will go till you come out into a spacious hall, in
which there are three doors; two of them stand open, the third is fastened with locks and bolts
of iron. Do not go through the door to the right lest you disturb the bones of the lords of
the treasure. Neither must you go through the door to the left, it leads to the snake's chamber,
where adders and serpents lodge; but open the fast-closed door by means of the well-known spring-root,
which you must on no account forget to take with you, or all your trouble will be for naught,
for no crowbar or mortal tools will help you. If you want to procure the root ask a wood-seller;
it is a common thing for hunters to need, and it is not hard to find. If the door bursts open
suddenly with great crackings and groanings do not be afraid, the noise is caused by the power
of the magic root, and you will not be hurt. Now trim your lamp that it may not fail you, for
you will be nearly blinded by the flash and glitter of the gold and precious stones on the
walls and pillars of the vault; but beware how you stretch out a hand towards the jewels! In
the midst of the cavern stands a copper chest, in that you will find gold and silver, enough
and to spare, and you may help yourself to your heart's content. If you take as much as you
can carry you will have sufficient to last your lifetime, and you may return three times; but
woe betide you if you venture to come a fourth time. You would have your trouble for your pains,
and would be punished for your greediness by falling down the stone steps and breaking your
leg. Do not neglect each time to heap back the loose earth which concealed the entrance of
the king's treasure chamber."

'As the apparition left off speaking my dog pricked up his ears and began to bark. I heard
the crack of a carter's whip and the noise of wheels in the distance, and when I looked again
the spectre had disappeared.'

So ended the shepherd's tale; and the landlord who was listening with the rest, said shrewdly:

'Tell us now, Father Martin, did you go to the mountain and find what the spirit promised you;
or is it a fable?'

'Nay, nay,' answered the graybeard. 'I cannot tell if the spectre lied, for never a step did
I go towards finding the hollow, for two reasons:--one was that my neck was too precious for
me to risk it in such a snare as that; the other, that no one could ever tell me where the
spring-root was to be found.'

Then Blaize, another aged shepherd, lifted up his voice.

"Tis a pity, Father Martin, that your secret has grown old with you. If you had told it forty
years ago truly you would not long have been lacking the spring-root. Even though you will
never climb the mountain now, I will tell you, for a joke, how it is to be found. The easiest
way to get it is by the help of a black woodpecker. Look, in the spring, where she builds her
nest in a hole in a tree, and when the time comes for her brood to fly off block up the entrance
to the nest with a hard sod, and lurk in ambush behind the tree till the bird returns to feed
her nestlings. When she perceives that she cannot get into her nest she will fly round the
tree uttering cries of distress, and then dart off towards the sun-setting. When you see her
do this, take a scarlet cloak, or if that be lacking to you, buy a few yards of scarlet cloth,
and hurry back to the tree before the woodpecker returns with the spring-root in her beak.
So soon as she touches with the root the sod that blocks the nest, it will fly violently out
of the hole. Then spread the red cloth quickly under the tree, so that the woodpecker may think
it is a fire, and in her terror drop the root. Some people really light a fire and strew spikenard
blossoms in it; but that is a clumsy method, for if the flames do not shoot up at the right
moment away will fly the woodpecker, carrying the root with her."

The party had listened with interest to this speech, but by the time it was ended the hour
was late, and they went their ways homeward, leaving only one man who had sat unheeded in a
corner the whole evening through.

Master Peter Bloch had once been a prosperous innkeeper, and a master-cook; but he had gone
steadily down in the world for some time, and was now quite poor.

Formerly he had been a merry fellow, fond of a joke, and in the art of cooking had no equal
in the town. He could make fish-jelly, and quince fritters, and even wafer-cakes; and he gilded
the ears of all his boars' heads. Peter had looked about him for a wife early in life, but
unluckily his choice fell upon a woman whose evil tongue was well known in the town. Ilse was
hated by everybody, and the young folks would go miles out of their way rather than meet her,
for she had some ill-word for everyone. Therefore, when Master Peter came along, and let himself
be taken in by her boasted skill as a housewife, she jumped at his offer, and they were married
the next day. But they had not got home before they began to quarrel. In the joy of his heart
Peter had tasted freely of his own good wine, and as the bride hung upon his arm he stumbled
and fell, dragging her down with him; whereupon she beat him soundly, and the neighbours said
truly that things did not promise well for Master Peter's comfort. Even when the ill-matched
couple were presently blessed with children, his happiness was but short lived, the savage
temper of his quarrelsome wife seemed to blight them from the first, and they died like little
kids in a cold winter.

Though Master Peter had no great wealth to leave behind him, still it was sad to him to be
childless; and he would bemoan himself to his friends, when he laid one baby after another
in the grave, saying: 'The lightning has been among the cherry-blossoms again, so there will
be no fruit to grow ripe.'

But, by-and-by, he had a little daughter so strong and healthy that neither her mother's temper
nor her father's spoiling could keep her from growing up tall and beautiful. Meanwhile the
fortunes of the family had changed. From his youth up, Master Peter had hated trouble; when
he had money he spent it freely, and fed all the hungry folk who asked him for bread. If his
pockets were empty he borrowed of his neighbours, but he always took good care to prevent his
scolding wife from finding out that he had done so. His motto was: 'It will all come right
in the end'; but what it did come to was ruin for Master Peter. He was at his wits' end to
know how to earn an honest living, for try as he might ill-luck seemed to pursue him, and he
lost one post after another, till at last all he could do was to carry sacks of corn to the
mill for his wife, who scolded him well if he was slow about it, and grudged him his portion
of food.

This grieved the tender heart of his pretty daughter, who loved him dearly, and was the comfort
of his life.

Peter was thinking of her as he sat in the inn kitchen and heard the shepherds talking about
the buried treasure, and for her sake he resolved to go and seek for it. Before he rose from
the landlord's arm-chair his plan was made, and Master Peter went home more joyful and full
of hope than he had been for many a long day; but on the way he suddenly remembered that he
was not yet possessed of the magic spring-root, and he stole into the house with a heavy heart,
and threw himself down upon his hard straw bed. He could neither sleep nor rest; but as soon
as it was light he got up and wrote down exactly all that was to be done to find the treasure,
that he might not forget anything, and when it lay clear and plain before his eyes he comforted
himself with the thought that, though he must do the rough work for his wife during one more
winter at least, he would not have to tread the path to the mill for the rest of his life.
Soon he heard his wife's harsh voice singing its morning song as she went about her household
affairs, scolding her daughter the while. She burst open his door while he was still dressing:
'Well, Toper!' was her greeting, 'have you been drinking all night, wasting money that you
steal from my housekeeping? For shame, drunkard!'

Master Peter, who was well used to this sort of talk, did not disturb himself, but waited till
the storm blew over, then he said calmly:

'Do not be annoyed, dear wife. I have a good piece of business in hand which may turn out well
for us.'

'You with a good business?' cried she, 'you are good for nothing but talk!'

'I am making my will,' said he, 'that when my hour comes my house may be in order.'

These unexpected words cut his daughter to the heart; she remembered that all night long she
had dreamed of a newly dug grave, and at this thought she broke out into loud lamentations.
But her mother only cried: 'Wretch! have you not wasted goods and possessions, and now do you
talk of making a will?'

And she seized him like a fury, and tried to scratch out his eyes. But by-and-by the quarrel
was patched up, and everything went on as before. From that day Peter saved up every penny
that his daughter Lucia gave him on the sly, and bribed the boys of his acquaintance to spy
out a black woodpecker's nest for him. He sent them into the woods and fields, but instead
of looking for a nest they only played pranks on him. They led him miles over hill and vale,
stock and stone, to find a raven's brood, or a nest of squirrels in a hollow tree, and when
he was angry with them they laughed in his face and ran away. This went on for some time, but
at last one of the boys spied out a woodpecker in the meadow-lands among the wood-pigeons,
and when he had found her nest in a half-dead alder tree, came running to Peter with the news
of his discovery. Peter could hardly believe his good fortune, and went quickly to see for
himself if it was really true; and when he reached the tree there certainly was a bird flying
in and out as if she had a nest in it. Peter was overjoyed at this fortunate discovery, and
instantly set himself to obtain a red cloak. Now in the whole town there was only one red cloak,
and that belonged to a man of whom nobody ever willingly asked a favour--Master Hammerling
the hangman. It cost Master Peter many struggles before he could bring himself to visit such
a person, but there was no help for it, and, little as he liked it, he ended by making his
request to the hangman, who was flattered that so respectable a man as Peter should borrow
his robe of office, and willingly lent it to him.

Peter now had all that was necessary to secure the magic root; he stopped up the entrance to
the nest, and everything fell out exactly as Blaize had foretold. As soon as the woodpecker
came back with the root in her beak out rushed Master Peter from behind the tree and displayed
the fiery red cloak so adroitly that the terrified bird dropped the root just where it could
be easily seen. All Peter's plans had succeeded, and he actually held in his hand the magic
root--that master-key which would unlock all doors, and bring its possessor unheard-of luck.
His thoughts now turned to the mountain, and he secretly made preparations for his journey.
He took with him only a staff, a strong sack, and a little box which his daughter Lucia had
given him.

It happened that on the very day Peter had chosen for setting out, Lucia and her mother went
off early to the town, leaving him to guard the house; but in spite of that he was on the point
of taking his departure when it occurred to him that it might be as well first to test the
much-vaunted powers of the magic root for himself. Dame Ilse had a strong cupboard with seven
locks built into the wall of her room, in which she kept all the money she had saved, and she
wore the key of it always hung about her neck. Master Peter had no control at all of the money
affairs of the household, so the contents of this secret hoard were quite unknown to him, and
this seemed to be a good opportunity for finding out what they were. He held the magic root
to the keyhole, and to his astonishment heard all the seven locks creaking and turning, the
door flew suddenly wide open, and his greedy wife's store of gold pieces lay before his eyes.
He stood still in sheer amazement, not knowing which to rejoice over most--this unexpected
find, or the proof of the magic root's real power; but at last he remembered that it was quite
time to be starting on his journey. So, filling his pockets with the gold, he carefully locked
the empty cupboard again and left the house without further delay. When Dame Ilse and her daughter
returned they wondered to find the house door shut, and Master Peter nowhere to be seen. They
knocked and called, but nothing stirred within but the house cat, and at last the blacksmith
had to be fetched to open the door. Then the house was searched from garret to cellar, but
no Master Peter was to be found.

'Who knows?' cried Dame Ilse at last, 'the wretch may have been idling in some tavern since
early morning.'

Then a sudden thought startled her, and she felt for her keys. Suppose they had fallen into
her good-for-nothing husband's hands and he had helped himself to her treasure! But no, the
keys were safe in their usual place, and the cupboard looked quite untouched. Mid-day came,
then evening, then midnight, and still no Master Peter appeared, and the matter became really
serious. Dame Ilse knew right well what a torment she had been to her husband, and remorse
caused her the gloomiest forebodings.

'Ah! Lucia,' she cried, 'I greatly fear that your father has done himself a mischief.' And
they sat till morning weeping over their own fancies.

As soon as it was light they searched every corner of the house again, and examined every nail
in the wall and every beam; but, luckily, Master Peter was not hanging from any of them. After
that the neighbours went out with long poles to fish in every ditch and pond, but they found
nothing, and then Dame Ilse gave up the idea of ever seeing her husband again and very soon
consoled herself, only wondering how the sacks of corn were to be carried to the mill in future.
She decided to buy a strong ass to do the work, and having chosen one, and after some bargaining
with the owner as to its price, she went to the cupboard in the wall to fetch the money. But
what were her feelings when she perceived that every shelf lay empty and bare before her! For
a moment she stood bewildered, then broke into such frightful ravings that Lucia ran to her
in alarm; but as soon as she heard of the disappearance of the money she was heartily glad,
and no longer feared that her father had come to any harm, but understood that he must have
gone out into the world to seek his fortune in some new way.

About a month after this, someone knocked at Dame Ilse's door one day, and she went to see
if it was a customer for meal; but in stepped a handsome young man, dressed like a duke's son,
who greeted her respectfully, and asked after her pretty daughter as if he were an old friend,
though she could not remember having ever set eyes upon him before.

However, she invited him to step into the house and be seated while he unfolded his business.
With a great air of mystery he begged permission to speak to the fair Lucia, of whose skill
in needlework he had heard so much, as he had a commission to give her. Dame Ilse had her own
opinion as to what kind of commission it was likely to be--brought by a young stranger to a
pretty maiden; however, as the meeting would be under her own eye, she made no objection, but
called to her industrious daughter, who left off working and came obediently; but when she
saw the stranger she stopped short, blushing, and casting down her eyes. He looked at her fondly,
and took her hand, which she tried to draw away, crying:

'Ah! Friedlin, why are you here? I thought you were a hundred miles away. Are you come to grieve
me again?'

'No, dearest girl,' answered he; 'I am come to complete your happiness and my own. Since we
last met my fortune has utterly changed; I am no longer the poor vagabond that I was then.
My rich uncle has died, leaving me money and goods in plenty, so that I dare to present myself
to your mother as a suitor for your hand. That I love you I know well; if you can love me I
am indeed a happy man.'

Lucia's pretty blue eyes had looked up shyly as he spoke, and now a smile parted her rosy lips;
and she stole a glance at her mother to see what she thought about it all; but the dame stood
lost in amazement to find that her daughter, whom she could have declared had never been out
of her sight, was already well acquainted with the handsome stranger, and quite willing to
be his bride. Before she had done staring, this hasty wooer had smoothed his way by covering
the shining table with gold pieces as a wedding gift to the bride's mother, and had filled
Lucia's apron into the bargain; after which the dame made no difficulties, and the matter was
speedily settled.

While Ilse gathered up the gold and hid it away safely, the lovers whispered together, and
what Friedlin told her seemed to make Lucia every moment more happy and contented.

Now a great hurry-burly began in the house, and preparations for the wedding went on apace.
A few days later a heavily laden waggon drove up, and out of it came so many boxes and bales
that Dame Ilse was lost in wonder at the wealth of her future son-in-law. The day for the wedding
was chosen, and all their friends and neighbours were bidden to the feast. As Lucia was trying
on her bridal wreath she said to her mother: 'This wedding-garland would please me indeed if
father Peter could lead me to the church. If only he could come back again! Here we are rolling
in riches while he may be nibbling at hunger's table.' And the very idea of such a thing made
her weep, while even Dame Ilse said:

'I should not be sorry myself to see him come back--there is always something lacking in a
house when the good man is away.'

But the fact was that she was growing quite tired of having no one to scold. And what do you
think happened?

On the very eve of the wedding a man pushing a wheelbarrow arrived at the city gate, and paid
toll upon a barrel of nails which it contained, and then made the best of his way to the bride's
dwelling and knocked at the door.

The bride herself peeped out of the window to see who it could be, and there stood father Peter!
Then there was great rejoicing in the house; Lucia ran to embrace him, and even Dame Ilse held
out her hand in welcome, and only said: 'Rogue, mend your ways,' when she remembered the empty
treasure cupboard. Father Peter greeted the bridegroom, looking at him shrewdly, while the
mother and daughter hastened to say all they knew in his favour, and appeared to be satisfied
with him as a son-in-law. When Dame Ilse had set something to eat before her husband, she was
curious to hear his adventures, and questioned him eagerly as to why he had gone away.

'God bless my native place,' said he. 'I have been marching through the country, and have tried
every kind of work, but now I have found a job in the iron trade; only, so far, I have put
more into it than I have earned by it. This barrel of nails is my whole fortune, which I wish
to give as my contribution towards the bride's house furnishing.'

This speech roused Dame Ilse to anger, and she broke out into such shrill reproaches that the
bystanders were fairly deafened, and Friedlin hastily offered Master Peter a home with Lucia
and himself, promising that he should live in comfort, and be always welcome. So Lucia had
her heart's desire, and father Peter led her to the church next day, and the marriage took
place very happily. Soon afterwards the young people settled in a fine house which Friedlin
had bought, and had a garden and meadows, a fishpond, and a hill covered with vines, and were
as happy as the day was long. Father Peter also stayed quietly with them, living, as everybody
believed, upon the generosity of his rich son-in law. No one suspected that his barrel of nails
was the real 'Horn of Plenty,' from which all this prosperity overflowed.

Peter had made the journey to the treasure mountain successfully, without being found out by
anybody. He had enjoyed himself by the way, and taken his own time, until he actually reached
the little brook in the valley which it had cost him some trouble to find. Then he pressed
on eagerly, and soon came to the little hollow in the wood; down he went, burrowing like a
mole into the earth; the magic root did its work, and at last the treasure lay before his eyes.
You may imagine how gaily Peter filled his sack with as much gold as he could carry, and how
he staggered up the seventy-seven steps with a heart full of hope and delight. He did not quite
trust the gnome's promises of safety, and was in such haste to find himself once more in the
light of day that he looked neither to the right nor the left, and could not afterwards remember
whether the walls and pillars had sparkled with jewels or not.

However, all went well--he neither saw nor heard anything alarming; the only thing that happened
was that the great iron-barred door shut with a crash as soon as he was fairly outside it,
and then he remembered that he had left the magic root behind him, so he could not go back
for another load of treasure. But even that did not trouble Peter much; he was quite satisfied
with what he had already. After he had faithfully done everything according to Father Martin's
instructions, and pressed the earth well back into the hollow, he sat down to consider how
he could bring his treasure back to his native place, and enjoy it there, without being forced
to share it with his scolding wife, who would give him no peace if she once found out about
it. At last, after much thinking, he hit upon a plan. He carried his sack to the nearest village,
and there bought a wheelbarrow, a strong barrel, and a quantity of nails. Then he packed his
gold into the barrel, covered it well with a layer of nails, hoisted it on to the wheelbarrow
with some difficulty, and set off with it upon his homeward way. At one place upon the road
he met a handsome young man who seemed by his downcast air to be in some great trouble. Sergt. pryor

 Eight hundred years is surely long enough to live.'

'Oh, certainly,' answered the prince; 'but, all the same, I would rather go and seek the land
where there is no death at all.'

So next morning he bade them farewell, though the princess begged him to stay with all her
might; and when she found that she could not persuade him she gave him as a remembrance a gold
ring. This ring was still more useful than the box, because when one wished oneself at any
place one was there directly, without even the trouble of flying to it through the air. The
prince put it on his finger, and thanking her heartily, went his way.

He walked on for some distance, and then he recollected the ring and thought he would try if
the princess had spoken truly as to its powers. 'I wish I was at the end of the world,' he
said, shutting his eyes, and when he opened them he was standing in a street full of marble
palaces. The men who passed him were tall and strong, and their clothes were magnificent. He
stopped some of them and asked in all the twenty-seven languages he knew what was the name
of the city, but no one answered him. Then his heart sank within him; what should he do in
this strange place if nobody could understand anything? he said. Suddenly his eyes fell upon
a man dressed after the fashion of his native country, and he ran up to him and spoke to him
in his own tongue. 'What city is this, my friend?' he inquired.

'It is the capital city of the Blue Kingdom,' replied the man, 'but the king himself is dead,
and his daughter is now the ruler.'

With this news the prince was satisfied, and begged his countryman to show him the way to the
young queen's palace. The man led him through several streets into a large square, one side
of which was occupied by a splendid building that seemed borne up on slender pillars of soft
green marble. In front was a flight of steps, and on these the queen was sitting wrapped in
a veil of shining silver mist, listening to the complaints of her people and dealing out justice.
When the prince came up she saw directly that he was no ordinary man, and telling her chamberlain
to dismiss the rest of her petitioners for that day, she signed to the prince to follow her
into the palace. Luckily she had been taught his language as a child, so they had no difficulty
in talking together.

The prince told all his story and how he was journeying in search of the Land of Immortality.
When he had finished, the princess, who had listened attentively, rose, and taking his arm,
led him to the door of another room, the floor of which was made entirely of needles, stuck
so close together that there was not room for a single needle more.

'Prince,' she said, turning to him, 'you see these needles? Well, know that neither I nor any
of my family can die till I have worn out these needles in sewing. It will take at least a
thousand years for that. Stay here, and share my throne; a thousand years is long enough to live!'

'Certainly,' answered he; 'still, at the end of the thousand years I should have to die! No,
I must find the land where there is no death.'

The queen did all she could to persuade him to stay, but as her words proved useless, at length
she gave it up. Then she said to him: 'As you will not stay, take this little golden rod as
a remembrance of me. It has the power to become anything you wish it to be, when you are in need.'

So the prince thanked her, and putting the rod in his pocket, went his way.

Scarcely had he left the town behind him when he came to a broad river which no man might pass,
for he was standing at the end of the world, and this was the river which flowed round it.
Not knowing what to do next, he walked a little distance up the bank, and there, over his head,
a beautiful city was floating in the air. He longed to get to it, but how? neither road nor
bridge was anywhere to be seen, yet the city drew him upwards, and he felt that here at last
was the country which he sought. Suddenly he remembered the golden rod which the mist-veiled
queen had given him. With a beating heart he flung it to the ground, wishing with all his might
that it should turn into a bridge, and fearing that, after all, this might prove beyond its
power. But no, instead of the rod, there stood a golden ladder, leading straight up to the
city of the air. He was about to enter the golden gates, when there sprang at him a wondrous
beast, whose like he had never seen. 'Out sword from the sheath,' cried the prince, springing
back with a cry. And the sword leapt from the scabbard and cut off some of the monster's heads,
but others grew again directly, so that the prince, pale with terror, stood where he was, calling
for help, and put his sword back in the sheath again.

The queen of the city heard the noise and looked from her window to see what was happening.
Summoning one of her servants, she bade him go and rescue the stranger, and bring him to her.
The prince thankfully obeyed her orders, and entered her presence.

The moment she looked at him, the queen also felt that he was no ordinary man, and she welcomed
him graciously, and asked him what had brought him to the city. In answer the prince told all
his story, and how he had travelled long and far in search of the Land of Immortality.

'You have found it,' said she, 'for I am queen over life and over death. Here you can dwell
among the immortals.'

A thousand years had passed since the prince first entered the city, but they had flown so
fast that the time seemed no more than six months. There had not been one instant of the thousand
years that the prince was not happy till one night when he dreamed of his father and mother.
Then the longing for his home came upon him with a rush, and in the morning he told the Queen
of the Immortals that he must go and see his father and mother once more. The queen stared
at him with amazement, and cried: 'Why, prince, are you out of your senses? It is more than
eight hundred years since your father and mother died! There will not even be their dust remaining.'

'I must go all the same,' said he.

'Well, do not be in a hurry,' continued the queen, understanding that he would not be prevented.
'Wait till I make some preparations for your journey.' So she unlocked her great treasure chest,
and took out two beautiful flasks, one of gold and one of silver, which she hung round his
neck. Then she showed him a little trap-door in one corner of the room, and said: 'Fill the
silver flask with this water, which is below the trap-door. It is enchanted, and whoever you
sprinkle with the water will become a dead man at once, even if he had lived a thousand years.
The golden flask you must fill with the water here,' she added, pointing to a well in another
corner. 'It springs from the rock of eternity; you have only to sprinkle a few drops on a body
and it will come to life again, if it had been a thousand years dead.'

The prince thanked the queen for her gifts, and, bidding her farewell, went on his journey.

He soon arrived in the town where the mist-veiled queen reigned in her palace, but the whole
city had changed, and he could scarcely find his way through the streets. In the palace itself
all was still, and he wandered through the rooms without meeting anyone to stop him. At last
he entered the queen's own chamber, and there she lay, with her embroidery still in her hands,
fast asleep. He pulled at her dress, but she did not waken. Then a dreadful idea came over
him, and he ran to the chamber where the needles had been kept, but it was quite empty. The
queen had broken the last over the work she held in her hand, and with it the spell was broken
too, and she lay dead.

Quick as thought the prince pulled out the golden flask, and sprinkled some drops of the water
over the queen. In a moment she moved gently, and raising her head, opened her eyes.

'Oh, my dear friend, I am so glad you wakened me; I must have slept a long while!'

'You would have slept till eternity,' answered the prince, 'if I had not been here to waken you.'

At these words the queen remembered about the needles. She knew now that she had been dead,
and that the prince had restored her to life. She gave him thanks from her heart for what he
had done, and vowed she would repay him if she ever got a chance.

The prince took his leave, and set out for the country of the bald-headed king. As he drew
near the place he saw that the whole mountain had been dug away, and that the king was lying
dead on the ground, his spade and bucket beside him. But as soon as the water from the golden
flask touched him he yawned and stretched himself, and slowly rose to his feet. 'Oh, my dear
friend, I am so glad to see you,' cried he, 'I must have slept a long while!'

'You would have slept till eternity if I had not been here to waken you,' answered the prince.
And the king remembered the mountain, and the spell, and vowed to repay the service if he ever
had a chance.

Further along the road which led to his old home the prince found the great tree torn up by
its roots, and the king of the eagles sitting dead on the ground, with his wings outspread
as if for flight. A flutter ran through the feathers as the drops of water fell on them, and
the eagle lifted his beak from the ground and said: 'Oh, how long I must have slept!

At last he reached the capital of his father's kingdom, but on reaching the place where the
royal palace had stood, instead of the marble galleries where he used to play, there lay a
great sulphur lake, its blue flames darting into the air. How was he to find his father and
mother, and bring them back to life, if they were lying at the bottom of that horrible water?
He turned away sadly and wandered back into the streets, hardly knowing where he was going;
when a voice behind him cried: 'Stop, prince, I have caught you at last! It is a thousand years
since I first began to seek you.' And there beside him stood the old, white-bearded, figure
of Death. Swiftly he drew the ring from his finger, and the king of the eagles, the bald-headed
king, and the mist-veiled queen, hastened to his rescue. In an instant they had seized upon
Death and held him tight, till the prince should have time to reach the Land of Immortality.
But they did not know how quickly Death could fly, and the prince had only one foot across
the border, when he felt the other grasped from behind, and the voice of Death calling: 'Halt!
now you are mine.'

The Queen of the Immortals was watching from her window, and cried to Death that he had no
power in her kingdom, and that he must seek his prey elsewhere.

'Quite true,' answered Death; 'but his foot is in my kingdom, and that belongs to me!'

'At any rate half of him is mine,' replied the Queen, 'and what good can the other half do
you? Half a man is no use, either to you or to me! But this once I will allow you to cross
into my kingdom, and we will decide by a wager whose he is.'

And so it was settled. Death stepped across the narrow line that surrounds the Land of Immortality,
and the queen proposed the wager which was to decide the prince's fate. 'I will throw him up
into the sky,' she said, 'right to the back of the morning star, and if he falls down into
this city, then he is mine. But if he should fall outside the walls, he shall belong to you.'

In the middle of the city was a great open square, and here the queen wished the wager to take
place. When all was ready, she put her foot under the foot of the prince and swung him into
the air. Up, up, he went, high amongst the stars, and no man's eyes could follow him. Had she
thrown him up straight? the queen wondered anxiously, for, if not, he would fall outside the
walls, and she would lose him for ever. The moments seemed long while she and Death stood gazing
up into the air, waiting to know whose prize the prince would be. Suddenly they both caught
sight of a tiny speck no bigger than a wasp, right up in the blue. Was he coming straight?
No! Yes! But as he was nearing the city, a light wind sprang up, and swayed him in the direction
of the wall. Another second and he would have fallen half over it, when the queen sprang forward,
seized him in her arms, and flung him into the castle. Then she commanded her servants to cast
Death out of the city, which they did, with such hard blows that he never dared to show his
face again in the Land of Immortality.

The Stone-Cutter

Once upon a time there lived a stone-cutter, who went every day to a great rock in the side
of a big mountain and cut out slabs for gravestones or for houses. He understood very well
the kinds of stones wanted for the different purposes, and as he was a careful workman he had
plenty of customers. For a long time he was quite happy and contented, and asked for nothing
better than what he had.

Now in the mountain dwelt a spirit which now and then appeared to men, and helped them in many
ways to become rich and prosperous. The stone-cutter, however, had never seen this spirit,
and only shook his head, with an unbelieving air, when anyone spoke of it. But a time was coming
when he learned to change his opinion.

One day the stone-cutter carried a gravestone to the house of a rich man, and saw there all
sorts of beautiful things, of which he had never even dreamed. Suddenly his daily work seemed
to grow harder and heavier, and he said to himself: 'Oh, if only I were a rich man, and could
sleep in a bed with silken curtains and golden tassels, how happy I should be!'

And a voice answered him: 'Your wish is heard; a rich man you shall be!'

At the sound of the voice the stone-cutter looked round, but could see nobody. He thought it
was all his fancy, and picked up his tools and went home, for he did not feel inclined to do
any more work that day. But when he reached the little house where he lived, he stood still
with amazement, for instead of his wooden hut was a stately palace filled with splendid furniture,
and most splendid of all was the bed, in every respect like the one he had envied. He was nearly
beside himself with joy, and in his new life the old one was soon forgotten.

It was now the beginning of summer, and each day the sun blazed more fiercely. One morning
the heat was so great that the stone-cutter could scarcely breathe, and he determined he would
stay at home till the evening. He was rather dull, for he had never learned how to amuse himself,
and was peeping through the closed blinds to see what was going on in the street, when a little
carriage passed by, drawn by servants dressed in blue and silver. In the carriage sat a prince,
and over his head a golden umbrella was held, to protect him from the sun's rays.

'Oh, if I were only a prince!' said the stone-cutter to himself, as the carriage vanished round
the corner. 'Oh, if I were only a prince, and could go in such a carriage and have a golden
umbrella held over me, how happy I should be!'

And the voice of the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; a prince you shall be.'

And a prince he was. Before his carriage rode one company of men and another behind it; servants
dressed in scarlet and gold bore him along, the coveted umbrella was held over his head, everything
heart could desire was his. But yet it was not enough. He looked round still for something
to wish for, and when he saw that in spite of the water he poured on his grass the rays of
the sun scorched it, and that in spite of the umbrella held over his head each day his face
grew browner and browner, he cried in his anger: 'The sun is mightier than I; oh, if I were
only the sun!'

And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; the sun you shall be.'

And the sun he was, and felt himself proud in his power. He shot his beams above and below,
on earth and in heaven; he burnt up the grass in the fields and scorched the faces of princes
as well as of poorer folk. But in a short time he began to grow tired of his might, for there
seemed nothing left for him to do. Discontent once more filled his soul, and when a cloud covered
his face, and hid the earth from him, he cried in his anger: 'Does the cloud hold captive my
rays, and is it mightier than I? Oh, that I were a cloud, and mightier than any!'

And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; a cloud you shall be!'

And a cloud he was, and lay between the sun and the earth. He caught the sun's beams and held
them, and to his joy the earth grew green again and flowers blossomed. But that was not enough
for him, and for days and weeks he poured forth rain till the rivers overflowed their banks,
and the crops of rice stood in water. Towns and villages were destroyed by the power of the
rain, only the great rock on the mountain side remained unmoved. The cloud was amazed at the
sight, and cried in wonder: 'Is the rock, then, mightier than I? Oh, if I were only the rock!'

And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; the rock you shall be!

And the rock he was, and gloried in his power. Proudly he stood, and neither the heat of the
sun nor the force of the rain could move him. 'This is better than all!' he said to himself.
But one day he heard a strange noise at his feet, and when he looked down to see what it could
be, he saw a stone-cutter driving tools into his surface. Even while he looked a trembling
feeling ran all through him, and a great block broke off and fell upon the ground. Then he
cried in his wrath: 'Is a mere child of earth mightier than a rock? Oh, if I were only a man!'

And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard. A man once more you shall be!'

And a man he was, and in the sweat of his brow he toiled again at his trade of stone-cutting.
His bed was hard and his food scanty, but he had learned to be satisfied with it, and did not
long to be something or somebody else. And as he never asked for things he had not got, or
desired to be greater and mightier than other people, he was happy at last, and heard the voice
of the mountain spirit no longer.

The Gold-Bearded Man

Once upon a time there lived a great king who had a wife and one son whom he loved very much.
The boy was still young when, one day, the king said to his wife: 'I feel that the hour of
my death draws near, and I want you to promise that you will never take another husband but
will give up your life to the care of our son.'

The queen burst into tears at these words, and sobbed out that she would never, never marry
again, and that her son's welfare should be her first thought as long as she lived. Her promise
comforted the troubled heart of the king, and a few days after he died, at peace with himself
and with the world.

But no sooner was the breath out of his body, than the queen said to herself, 'To promise is
one thing, and to keep is quite another.' And hardly was the last spadeful of earth flung over
the coffin than she married a noble from a neighbouring country, and got him made king instead
of the young prince. Her new husband was a cruel, wicked man, who treated his stepson very
badly, and gave him scarcely anything to eat, and only rags to wear; and he would certainly
have killed the boy but for fear of the people.

Now by the palace grounds there ran a brook, but instead of being a water-brook it was a milk-brook,
and both rich and poor flocked to it daily and drew as much milk as they chose. The first thing
the new king did when he was seated on the throne, was to forbid anyone to go near the brook,
on pain of being seized by the watchmen. And this was purely spite, for there was plenty of
milk for everybody.

For some days no one dared venture near the banks of the stream, but at length some of the
watchmen noticed that early in the mornings, just at dawn, a man with a gold beard came down
to the brook with a pail, which he filled up to the brim with milk, and then vanished like
smoke before they could get near enough to see who he was. So they went and told the king what
they had seen.

At first the king would not believe their story, but as they persisted it was quite true, he
said that he would go and watch the stream that night himself. With the earliest streaks of
dawn the gold-bearded man appeared, and filled his pail as before. Then in an instant he had
vanished, as if the earth had swallowed him up.

The king stood staring with eyes and mouth open at the place where the man had disappeared.
He had never seen him before, that was certain; but what mattered much more was how to catch
him, and what should be done with him when he was caught? He would have a cage built as a prison
for him, and everyone would talk of it, for in other countries thieves were put in prison,
and it was long indeed since any king had used a cage. It was all very well to plan, and even
to station a watchman behind every bush, but it was of no use, for the man was never caught.
They would creep up to him softly on the grass, as he was stooping to fill his pail, and just
as they stretched out their hands to seize him, he vanished before their eyes. Time after time
this happened, till the king grew mad with rage, and offered a large reward to anyone who could
tell him how to capture his enemy.

The first person that came with a scheme was an old soldier who promised the king that if he
would only put some bread and bacon and a flask of wine on the bank of the stream, the gold-bearded
man would be sure to eat and drink, and they could shake some powder into the wine, which would
send him to sleep at once. After that there was nothing to do but to shut him in the cage.

This idea pleased the king, and he ordered bread and bacon and a flask of drugged wine to be
placed on the bank of the stream, and the watchers to be redoubled. Then, full of hope, he
awaited the result.

Everything turned out just as the soldier had said. Early next morning the gold-bearded man
came down to the brook, ate, drank, and fell sound asleep, so that the watchers easily bound
him, and carried him off to the palace. In a moment the king had him fast in the golden cage,
and showed him, with ferocious joy, to the strangers who were visiting his court. The poor
captive, when he awoke from his drunken sleep, tried to talk to them, but no one would listen
to him, so he shut himself up altogether, and the people who came to stare took him for a dumb
man of the woods. He wept and moaned to himself all day, and would hardly touch food, though,
in dread that he should die and escape his tormentors, the king ordered his head cook to send
him dishes from the royal table.

The gold-bearded man had been in captivity about a month, when the king was forced to make
war upon a neighbouring country, and left the palace, to take command of his army. But before
he went he called his stepson to him and said:

'Listen, boy, to what I tell you. While I am away I trust the care of my prisoner to you. See
that he has plenty to eat and drink, but be careful that he does not escape, or even walk about
the room. If I return and find him gone, you will pay for it by a terrible death.'

The young prince was thankful that his stepfather was going to the war, and secretly hoped
he might never come back. Directly he had ridden off the boy went to the room where the cage
was kept, and never left it night and day. He even played his games beside it.

One day he was shooting at a mark with a silver bow; one of his arrows fell into the golden cage.

'Please give me my arrow,' said the prince, running up to him; but the gold-bearded man answered:

'No, I shall not give it to you unless you let me out of my cage.'

'I may not let you out,' replied the boy, 'for if I do my stepfather says that I shall have
to die a horrible death when he returns from the war. My arrow can be of no use to you, so
give it to me.'

The man handed the arrow through the bars, but when he had done so he begged harder than ever
that the prince would open the door and set him free. Indeed, he prayed so earnestly that the
prince's heart was touched, for he was a tender-hearted boy who pitied the sorrows of other
people. So he shot back the bolt, and the gold-bearded man stepped out into the world.

'I will repay you a thousand fold for that good deed.' said the man, and then he vanished.
The prince began to think what he should say to the king when he came back; then he wondered
whether it would be wise to wait for his stepfather's return and run the risk of the dreadful
death which had been promised him. 'No,' he said to himself, 'I am afraid to stay. Perhaps
the world will be kinder to me than he has been.'

Unseen he stole out when twilight fell, and for many days he wandered over mountains and through
forests and valleys without knowing where he was going or what he should do. He had only the
berries for food, when, one morning, he saw a wood-pigeon sitting on a bough. In an instant
he had fitted an arrow to his bow, and was taking aim at the bird, thinking what a good meal
he would make off him, when his weapon fell to the ground at the sound of the pigeon's voice:

'Do not shoot, I implore you, noble prince! I have two little sons at home, and they will die
of hunger if I am not there to bring them food.'

And the young prince had pity, and unstrung his bow.

'Oh, prince, I will repay your deed of mercy, said the grateful wood-pigeon.

'Poor thing! how can you repay me?' asked the prince.

'You have forgotten,' answered the wood-pigeon, 'the proverb that runs, "mountain and mountain
can never meet, but one living creature can always come across another."' The boy laughed at
this speech and went his way.

By-and-by he reached the edge of a lake, and flying towards some rushes which grew near the
shore he beheld a wild duck. Now, in the days that the king, his father, was alive, and he
had everything to eat he could possibly wish for, the prince always had wild duck for his birthday
dinner, so he quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and took a careful aim.

'Do not shoot, I pray you, noble prince!' cried the wild duck; 'I have two little sons at home;
they will die of hunger if I am not there to bring them food.'

And the prince had pity, and let fall his arrow and unstrung his bow.

'Oh, prince! I will repay your deed of mercy,' exclaimed the grateful wild duck.

'You poor thing! how can you repay me?' asked the prince.

He had not wandered far from the shores of the lake, when he noticed a stork standing on one
leg, and again he raised his bow and prepared to take aim.

'Do not shoot, I pray you, noble prince,' cried the stork; 'I have two little sons at home;
they will die of hunger if I am not there to bring them food.'

Again the prince was filled with pity, and this time also he did not shoot.

'Oh, prince, I will repay your deed of mercy,' cried the stork.

'You poor stork! how can you repay me?' asked the prince. He had not gone far, when he fell
in with two discharged soldiers.

'Where are you going, little brother?' asked one.

'I am seeking work,' answered the prince.

'So are we,' replied the soldier. 'We can all go together.'

The boy was glad of company and they went on, and on, and on, through seven kingdoms, without
finding anything they were able to do. At length they reached a palace, and there was the king
standing on the steps.

'You seem to be looking for something,' said he.

'It is work we want,' they all answered.

So the king told the soldiers that they might become his coachmen; but he made the boy his
companion, and gave him rooms near his own. The soldiers were dreadfully angry when they heard
this, for of course they did not know that the boy was really a prince; and they soon began
to lay their heads together to plot his ruin.

Then they went to the king.

'Your Majesty,' they said, 'we think it our duty to tell you that your new companion has boasted
to us that if he were only your steward he would not lose a single grain of corn out of the
storehouses. Now, if your Majesty would give orders that a sack of wheat should be mixed with
one of barley, and would send for the youth, and command him to separate the grains one from
another, in two hours' time, you would soon see what his talk was worth.'

The king, who was weak, listened to what these wicked men had told him, and desired the prince
to have the contents of the sack piled into two heaps by the time that he returned from his
council. 'If you succeed,' he added, 'you shall be my steward, but if you fail, I will put
you to death on the spot.'

The unfortunate prince declared that he had never made any such boast as was reported; but
it was all in vain. The king did not believe him, and turning him into an empty room, bade
his servants carry in the huge sack filled with wheat and barley, and scatter them in a heap
on the floor.

The prince hardly knew where to begin, and indeed if he had had a thousand people to help him,
and a week to do it in, he could never have finished his task. So he flung himself on the ground
in despair, and covered his face with his hands.

While he lay thus, a wood-pigeon flew in through the window.

'Why are you weeping, noble prince?' asked the wood-pigeon.

'How can I help weeping at the task set me by the king. For he says, if I fail to do it, I
shall die a horrible death.'

'Oh, there is really nothing to cry about,' answered the wood-pigeon soothingly. 'I am the
king of the wood-pigeons, whose life you spared when you were hungry. And now I will repay
my debt, as I promised.' So saying he flew out of the window, leaving the prince with some
hope in his heart.

In a few minutes he returned, followed by a cloud of wood-pigeons, so dense that it seemed
to fill the room. Their king showed them what they had to do, and they set to work so hard
that the grain was sorted into two heaps long before the council was over. When the king came
back he could not believe his eyes; but search as he might through the two heaps, he could
not find any barley among the wheat, or any wheat amongst the barley. So he praised the prince
for his industry and cleverness, and made him his steward at once.

This made the two soldiers more envious still, and they began to hatch another plot.

'Your Majesty,' they said to the king, one day, as he was standing on the steps of the palace,
'that fellow has been boasting again, that if he had the care of your treasures not so much
as a gold pin should ever be lost. Put this vain fellow to the proof, we pray you, and throw
the ring from the princess's finger into the brook, and bid him find it. We shall soon see
what his talk is worth.'

And the foolish king listened to them, and ordered the prince to be brought before him.

'My son,' he said, 'I have heard that you have declared that if I made you keeper of my treasures
you would never lose so much as a gold pin. Now, in order to prove the truth of your words,
I am going to throw the ring from the princess's finger into the brook, and if you do not find
it before I come back from council, you will have to die a horrible death.'

It was no use denying that he had said anything of the kind. The king did not believe him;
in fact he paid no attention at all, and hurried off, leaving the poor boy speechless with
despair in the corner. However, he soon remembered that though it was very unlikely that he
should find the ring in the brook, it was impossible that he should find it by staying in the
palace.

For some time the prince wandered up and down peering into the bottom of the stream, but though
the water was very clear, nothing could he see of the ring. At length he gave it up in despair,
and throwing himself down at the foot of the tree, he wept bitterly.

'What is the matter, dear prince?' said a voice just above him, and raising his head, he saw
the wild duck.

'The king of this country declares I must die a horrible death if I cannot find the princess's
ring which he has thrown into the brook,' answered the prince.

'Oh, you must not vex yourself about that, for I can help you,' replied the bird. 'I am the
king of the wild ducks, whose life you spared, and now it is my turn to save yours.' Then he
flew away, and in a few minutes a great flock of wild ducks were swimming all up and down the
stream looking with all their might, and long before the king came back from his council there
it was, safe on the grass beside the prince.

At this sight the king was yet more astonished at the cleverness of his steward, and at once
promoted him to be the keeper of his jewels.

Now you would have thought that by this time the king would have been satisfied with the prince,
and would have left him alone; but people's natures are very hard to change, and when the two
envious soldiers came to him with a new falsehood, he was as ready to listen to them as before.

'Gracious Majesty,' said they, 'the youth whom you have made keeper of your jewels has declared
to us that a child shall be born in the palace this night, which will be able to speak every
language in the world and to play every instrument of music. Is he then become a prophet, or
a magician, that he should know things which have not yet come to pass?'

At these words the king became more angry than ever. He had tried to learn magic himself, but
somehow or other his spells would never work, and he was furious to hear that the prince claimed
a power that he did not possess. Stammering with rage, he ordered the youth to be brought before
him, and vowed that unless this miracle was accomplished he would have the prince dragged at
a horse's tail until he was dead.

In spite of what the soldiers had said, the boy knew no more magic than the king did, and his
task seemed more hopeless than before. He lay weeping in the chamber which he was forbidden
to leave, when suddenly he heard a sharp tapping at the window, and, looking up, he beheld a stork.

'What makes you so sad, prince?' asked he.

'Someone has told the king that I have prophesied that a child shall be born this night in
the palace, who can speak all the languages in the world and play every musical instrument.
I am no magician to bring these things to pass, but he says that if it does not happen he will
have me dragged through the city at a horse's tail till I die.'

'Do not trouble yourself,' answered the stork. 'I will manage to find such a child, for I am
the king of the storks whose life you spared, and now I can repay you for it.'

The stork flew away and soon returned carrying in his beak a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes,
and laid it down near a lute. In an instant the baby stretched out its little hands and began
to play a tune so beautiful that even the prince forgot his sorrows as he listened. Then he
was given a flute and a zither, but he was just as well able to draw music from them; and the
prince, whose courage was gradually rising, spoke to him in all the languages he knew. The
baby answered him in all, and no one could have told which was his native tongue!

The next morning the king went straight to the prince's room, and saw with his own eyes the
wonders that baby could do. 'If your magic can produce such a baby,' he said, 'you must be
greater than any wizard that ever lived, and shall have my daughter in marriage.' And, being
a king, and therefore accustomed to have everything the moment he wanted it, he commanded the
ceremony to be performed without delay, and a splendid feast to be made for the bride and bridegroom.
When it was over, he said to the prince:

'Now that you are really my son, tell me by what arts you were able to fulfil the tasks I set you?'

'My noble father-in-law,' answered the prince, 'I am ignorant of all spells and arts. But somehow
I have always managed to escape the death which has threatened me.' And he told the king how
he had been forced to run away from his stepfather, and how he had spared the three birds,
and had joined the two soldiers, who had from envy done their utmost to ruin him.

The king was rejoiced in his heart that his daughter had married a prince, and not a common
man, and he chased the two soldiers away with whips, and told them that if they ever dared
to show their faces across the borders of his kingdom, they should die the same death he had
prepared for the prince.

[From Ungarische Mahrchen]

Tritill, Litill, And The Birds

Once upon a time there lived a princess who was so beautiful and so good that everybody loved
her. Her father could hardly bear her out of his sight, and he almost died of grief when, one
day, she disappeared, and though the whole kingdom was searched through and through, she could
not be found in any corner of it. In despair, the king ordered a proclamation to be made that
whoever could bring her back to the palace should have her for his wife. This made the young
men start afresh on the search, but they were no more successful than before, and returned
sorrowfully to their homes.

Now there dwelt, not far from the palace, an old man who had three sons. The two eldest were
allowed by their parents to do just as they liked, but the youngest was always obliged to give
way to his brothers. When they were all grown up, the eldest told his father that he was tired
of leading such a quiet life, and that he meant to go away and see the world.

The old people were very unhappy at the thought that they must part with him, but they said
nothing, and began to collect all that he would want for his travels, and were careful to add
a pair of new boots. When everything was ready, he bade them farewell, and started merrily
on his way.

For some miles his road lay through a wood, and when he left it he suddenly came out on a bare
hillside. Here he sat down to rest, and pulling out his wallet prepared to eat his dinner.

He had only eaten a few mouthfuls when an old man badly dressed passed by, and seeing the food,
asked if the young man could not spare him a little.

'Not I, indeed!' answered he; 'why I have scarcely enough for myself. If you want food you
must earn it.' And the beggar went on.

After the young man had finished his dinner he rose and walked on for several hours, till he
reached a second hill, where he threw himself down on the grass, and took some bread and milk
from his wallet. While he was eating and drinking, there came by an old man, yet more wretched
than the first, and begged for a few mouthfuls. But instead of food he only got hard words,
and limped sadly away.

Towards evening the young man reached an open space in the wood, and by this time he thought
he would like some supper. The birds saw the food, and flew round his head in numbers hoping
for some crumbs, but he threw stones at them, and frightened them off. Then he began to wonder
where he should sleep. Not in the open space he was in, for that was bare and cold, and though
he had walked a long way that day, and was tired, he dragged himself up, and went on seeking
for a shelter.

At length he saw a deep sort of hole or cave under a great rock, and as it seemed quite empty,
he went in, and lay down in a corner. About midnight he was awakened by a noise, and peeping
out he beheld a terrible ogress approaching. He implored her not to hurt him, but to let him
stay there for the rest of the night, to which she consented, on condition that he should spend
the next day in doing any task which she might choose to set him. To this the young man willingly
agreed, and turned over and went to sleep again. In the morning, the ogress bade him sweep
the dust out of the cave, and to have it clean before her return in the evening, otherwise
it would be the worse for him. Then she left the cave.

The young man took the spade, and began to clean the floor of the cave, but try as he would
to move it the dirt still stuck to its place. He soon gave up the task, and sat sulkily in
the corner, wondering what punishment the ogress would find for him, and why she had set him
to do such an impossible thing.

He had not long to wait, after the ogress came home, before he knew what his punishment was
to be! She just gave one look at the floor of the cave, then dealt him a blow on the head which
cracked his skull, and there was an end of him.

Meanwhile his next brother grew tired of staying at home, and let his parents have no rest
till they had consented that he also should be given some food and some new boots, and go out
to see the world. On his road, he also met the two old beggars, who prayed for a little of
his bread and milk, but this young man had never been taught to help other people, and had
made it a rule through his life to keep all he had to himself. So he turned a deaf ear and
finished his dinner.

By-and-by he, too, came to the cave, and was bidden by the ogress to clean the floor, but he
was no more successful than his brother, and his fate was the same.

Anyone would have thought that when the old people had only one son left that at least they
would have been kind to him, even if they did not love him. But for some reason they could
hardly bear the sight of him, though he tried much harder to make them comfortable than his
brothers had ever done. So when he asked their leave to go out into the world they gave it
at once, and seemed quite glad to be rid of him. They felt it was quite generous of them to
provide him with a pair of new boots and some bread and milk for his journey.

Besides the pleasure of seeing the world, the youth was very anxious to discover what had become
of his brothers, and he determined to trace, as far as he could, the way that they must have
gone. He followed the road that led from his father's cottage to the hill, where he sat down
to rest, saying to himself: 'I am sure my brothers must have stopped here, and I will do the same.'

He was hungry as well as tired, and took out some of the food his parents had given him. He
was just going to begin to eat when the old man appeared, and asked if he could not spare him
a little. The young man at once broke off some of the bread, begging the old man to sit down
beside him, and treating him as if he was an old friend. At last the stranger rose, and said
to him: 'If ever you are in trouble call me, and I will help you. My name is Tritill.' Then
he vanished, and the young man could not tell where he had gone.

However, he felt he had now rested long enough, and that he had better be going his way. At
the next hill he met with the second old man, and to him also he gave food and drink. And when
this old man had finished he said, like the first: 'If you ever want help in the smallest thing
call to me. My name is Litill.'

The young man walked on till he reached the open space in the wood, where he stopped for dinner.
In a moment all the birds in the world seemed flying round his head, and he crumbled some of
his bread for them and watched them as they darted down to pick it up. When they had cleared
off every crumb the largest bird with the gayest plumage said to him: 'If you are in trouble
and need help say, "My birds, come to me!" and we will come.' Then they flew away.

Towards evening the young man reached the cave where his brothers had met their deaths, and,
like them, he thought it would be a good place to sleep in. Looking round, he saw some pieces
of the dead men's clothes and of their bones. The sight made him shiver, but he would not move
away, and resolved to await the return of the ogress, for such he knew she must be.

Very soon she came striding in, and he asked politely if she would give him a night's lodging.
She answered as before, that he might stay on condition that he should do any work that she
might set him to next morning. So the bargain being concluded, the young man curled himself
up in his corner and went to sleep.

The dirt lay thicker than ever on the floor of the cave when the young man took the spade and
began his work. He could not clear it any more than his brothers had done, and at last the
spade itself stuck in the earth so that he could not pull it out. The youth stared at it in
despair, then the old beggar's words flashed into his mind, and he cried: 'Tritill, Tritill,
come and help me!'

And Tritill stood beside him and asked what he wanted. The youth told him all his story, and
when he had finished, the old man said: 'Spade and shovel do your duty,' and they danced about
the cave till, in a short time, there was not a speck of dust left on the floor. As soon as
it was quite clean Tritill went his way.

With a light heart the young man awaited the return of the ogress. When she came in she looked
carefully round, and then said to him: 'You did not do that quite alone. However, as the floor
is clean I will leave your head on.'

The following morning the ogress told the young man that he must take all the feathers out
of her pillows and spread them to dry in the sun. But if one feather was missing when she came
back at night his head should pay for it.'

The young man fetched the pillows, and shook out all the feathers, and oh! what quantities
of them there were! He was thinking to himself, as he spread them out carefully, how lucky
it was that the sun was so bright and that there was no wind, when suddenly a breeze sprang
up, and in a moment the feathers were dancing high in the air. At first the youth tried to
collect them again, but he soon found that it was no use, and he cried in despair: 'Tritill,
Litill, and all my birds, come and help me!'

He had hardly said the words when there they all were; and when the birds had brought all the
feathers back again, Tritill, and Litill, and he, put them away in the pillows, as the ogress
had bidden him. But one little feather they kept out, and told the young man that if the ogress
missed it he was to thrust it up her nose. Then they all vanished, Tritill, Litill, and the birds.

Directly the ogress returned home she flung herself with all her weight on the bed, and the
whole cave quivered under her. The pillows were soft and full instead of being empty, which
surprised her, but that did not content her. She got up, shook out the pillow-cases one by
one, and began to count the feathers that were in each. 'If one is missing I will have your
head,' said she, and at that the young man drew the feather from his pocket and thrust it up
her nose, crying 'If you want your feather, here it is.'

'You did not sort those feathers alone,' answered the ogress calmly; 'however, this time I
will let that pass.'

That night the young man slept soundly in his corner, and in the morning the ogress told him
that his work that day would be to slay one of her great oxen, to cook its heart, and to make
drinking cups of its horns, before she returned home 'There are fifty oxen,' added she, 'and
you must guess which of the herd I want killed. If you guess right, to-morrow you shall be
free to go where you will, and you shall choose besides three things as a reward for your service.
But if you slay the wrong ox your head shall pay for it.'

Left alone, the young man stood thinking for a little. Then he called: 'Tritill, Litill, come
to my help!'

In a moment he saw them, far away, driving the biggest ox the youth had ever seen. When they
drew near, Tritill killed it, Litill took out its heart for the young man to cook, and both
began quickly to turn the horns into drinking cups. The work went merrily on, and they talked
gaily, and the young man told his friends of the payment promised him by the ogress if he had
done her bidding. The old men warned him that he must ask her for the chest which stood at
the foot of her bed, for whatever lay on the top of the bed, and for what lay under the side
of the cave. The young man thanked them for their counsel, and Tritill and Litill then took
leave of him, saying that for the present he would need them no more.

Scarcely had they disappeared when the ogress came back, and found everything ready just as
she had ordered. Before she sat down to eat the bullock's heart she turned to the young man,
and said: 'You did not do that all alone, my friend; but, nevertheless, I will keep my word,
and to-morrow you shall go your way.' So they went to bed and slept till dawn.

When the sun rose the ogress awoke the young man, and called to him to choose any three things
out of her house.

'I choose,' answered he, 'the chest which stands at the foot of your bed; whatever lies on
the top of the bed, and whatever is under the side of the cave.'

'You did not choose those things by yourself, my friend,' said the ogress; 'but what I have
promised, that will I do.'

And then she gave him his reward.

'The thing which lay on the top of the bed' turned out to be the lost princess. 'The chest
which stood at the foot of the bed' proved full of gold and precious stones; and 'what was
under the side of the cave' he found to be a great ship, with oars and sails that went of itself
as well on land as in the water. 'You are the luckiest man that ever was born,' said the ogress
as she went out of the cave as usual.

With much difficulty the youth put the heavy chest on his shoulders and carried it on board
the ship, the princess walking by his side. Then he took the helm and steered the vessel back
to her father's kingdom. The king's joy at receiving back his lost daughter was so great that
he almost fainted, but when he recovered himself he made the young man tell him how everything
had really happened. 'You have found her, and you shall marry her,' said the king; and so it
was done. And this is the end of the story.

[From Ungarische Mahrchen.]

The Three Robes

Long, long ago, a king and queen reigned over a large and powerful country. What their names
were nobody knows, but their son was called Sigurd, and their daughter Lineik, and these young
people were famed throughout the whole kingdom for their wisdom and beauty.

There was only a year between them, and they loved each other so much that they could do nothing
apart. When they began to grow up the king gave them a house of their own to live in, with
servants and carriages, and everything they could possibly want.

For many years they all lived happily together, and then the queen fell ill, and knew that
she would never get better.

'Promise me two things,' she said one day to the king; 'one, that if you marry again, as indeed
you must, you will not choose as your wife a woman from some small state or distant island,
who knows nothing of the world, and will be taken up with thoughts of her grandeur. But rather
seek out a princess of some great kingdom, who has been used to courts all her life, and holds
them at their true worth. The other thing I have to ask is, that you will never cease to watch
over our children, who will soon become your greatest joy.'

These were the queen's last words, and a few hours later she was dead. The king was so bowed
down with sorrow that he would not attend even to the business of the kingdom, and at last
his Prime Minister had to tell him that the people were complaining that they had nobody to
right their wrongs. 'You must rouse yourself, sir,' went on the minister, 'and put aside your
own sorrows for the sake of your country.'

'You do not spare me,' answered the king; 'but what you say is just, and your counsel is good.
I have heard that men say, likewise, that it will be for the good of my kingdom for me to marry
again, though my heart will never cease to be with my lost wife. But it was her wish also;
therefore, to you I entrust the duty of finding a lady fitted to share my throne; only, see
that she comes neither from a small town nor a remote island.'

So an embassy was prepared, with the minister at its head, to visit the greatest courts in
the world, and to choose out a suitable princess. But the vessel which carried them had not
been gone many days when a thick fog came on, and the captain could see neither to the right
nor to the left. For a whole month the ship drifted about in darkness, till at length the fog
lifted and they beheld a cliff jutting out just in front. On one side of the cliff lay a sheltered
bay, in which the vessel was soon anchored, and though they did not know where they were, at
any rate they felt sure of fresh fruit and water.

The minister left the rest of his followers on board the ship, and taking a small boat rowed
himself to land, in order to look about him and to find out if the island was really as deserted
as it seemed.

He had not gone far, when he heard the sound of music, and, turning in its direction, he saw
a woman of marvellous beauty sitting on a low stool playing on a harp, while a girl beside
her sang. The minister stopped and greeted the lady politely, and she replied with friendliness,
asking him why he had come to such an out-of-the way place. In answer he told her of the object
of his journey.

'I am in the same state as your master,' replied the lady; 'I was married to a mighty king
who ruled over this land, till Vikings [sea-robbers] came and slew him and put all the people
to death. But I managed to escape, and hid myself here with my daughter.'

And the daughter listened, and said softly to her mother: 'Are you speaking the truth now?'

'Remember your promise,' answered the mother angrily, giving her a pinch which was unseen by
the minister.

'What is your name, madam?' asked he, much touched by this sad story.

'Blauvor,' she replied 'and my daughter is called Laufer'; and then she inquired the name of
the minister, and of the king his master. After this they talked of many things, and the lady
showed herself learned in all that a woman should know, and even in much that men only were
commonly taught. 'What a wife she would make for the king,' thought the minister to himself,
and before long he had begged the honour of her hand for his master. She declared at first
that she was too unworthy to accept the position offered her, and that the minister would soon
repent his choice; but this only made him the more eager, and in the end he gained her consent,
and prevailed on her to return with him at once to his own country.

The minister then conducted the mother and daughter back to the ship; the anchor was raised,
the sails spread, and a fair wind was behind them.

Now that the fog had lifted they could see as they looked back that, except just along the
shore, the island was bare and deserted and not fit for men to live in; but about that nobody
cared. They had a quick voyage, and in six days they reached the land, and at once set out
for the capital, a messenger being sent on first by the minister to inform the king of what
had happened.

When his Majesty's eyes fell on the two beautiful women, clad in dresses of gold and silver,
he forgot his sorrows and ordered preparations for the wedding to be made without delay. In
his joy he never remembered to inquire in what kind of country the future queen had been found.
In fact his head was so turned by the beauty of the two ladies that when the invitations were
sent by his orders to all the great people in the kingdom, he did not even recollect his two
children, who remained shut up in their own house!

After the marriage the king ceased to have any will of his own and did nothing without consulting
his wife. She was present at all his councils, and her opinion was asked before making peace
or war. But when a few months had passed the king began to have doubts as to whether the minister's
choice had really been a wise one, and he noticed that his children lived more and more in
their palace and never came near their stepmother.

It always happens that if a person's eyes are once opened they see a great deal more than they
ever expected; and soon it struck the king that the members of his court had a way of disappearing
one after the other without any reason. At first he had not paid much attention to the fact,
but merely appointed some fresh person to the vacant place. As, however, man after man vanished
without leaving any trace, he began to grow uncomfortable and to wonder if the queen could
have anything to do with it.

Things were in this state when, one day, his wife said to him that it was time for him to make
a progress through his kingdom and see that his governors were not cheating him of the money
that was his due. 'And you need not be anxious about going,' she added, 'for I will rule the
country while you are away as carefully as you could yourself.'

The king had no great desire to undertake this journey, but the queen's will was stronger than
his, and he was too lazy to make a fight for it. So he said nothing and set about his preparations,
ordering his finest ship to be ready to carry him round the coast. Still his heart was heavy,
and he felt uneasy, though he could not have told why; and the night before he was to start
he went to the children's palace to take leave of his son and daughter.

He had not seen them for some time, and they gave him a warm welcome, for they loved him dearly
and he had always been kind to them. They had much to tell him, but after a while he checked
their merry talk and said:

'If I should never come back from this journey I fear that it may not be safe for you to stay
here; so directly there are no more hopes of my return go instantly and take the road eastwards
till you reach a high mountain, which you must cross. Once over the mountain keep along by
the side of a little bay till you come to two trees, one green and the other red, standing
in a thicket, and so far back from the road that without looking for them you would never see
them. Hide each in the trunk of one of the trees and there you will be safe from all your enemies.'

With these words the king bade them farewell and entered sadly into his ship. For a few days
the wind was fair, and everything seemed going smoothly; then, suddenly, a gale sprang up,
and a fearful storm of thunder and lightning, such as had never happened within the memory
of man. In spite of the efforts of the frightened sailors the vessel was driven on the rocks,
and not a man on board was saved.

That very night Prince Sigurd had a dream, in which he thought his father appeared to him in
dripping clothes, and, taking the crown from his head, laid it at his son's feet, leaving the
room as silently as he had entered it.

Hastily the prince awoke his sister Lineik, and they agreed that their father must be dead,
and that they must lose no time in obeying his orders and putting themselves in safety. So
they collected their jewels and a few clothes and left the house without being observed by anyone.

They hurried on till they arrived at the mountain without once looking back. Then Sigurd glanced
round and saw that their stepmother was following them, with an expression on her face which
made her uglier than the ugliest old witch. Between her and them lay a thick wood, and Sigurd
stopped for a moment to set it on fire; then he and his sister hastened on more swiftly than
before, till they reached the grove with the red and green trees, into which they jumped, and
felt that at last they were safe.

Now, at that time there reigned over Greece a king who was very rich and powerful, although
his name has somehow been forgotten. He had two children, a son and a daughter, who were more
beautiful and accomplished than any Greeks had been before, and they were the pride of their
father's heart.

The prince had no sooner grown out of boyhood than he prevailed on his father to make war during
the summer months on a neighbouring nation, so as to give him a chance of making himself famous.
In winter, however, when it was difficult to get food and horses in that wild country, the
army was dispersed, and the prince returned home.

During one of these wars he had heard reports of the Princess Lineik's beauty, and he resolved
to seek her out, and to ask for her hand in marriage. All this Blauvor, the queen, found out
by means of her black arts, and when the prince drew near the capital she put a splendid dress
on her own daughter and then went to meet her guest.

She bade him welcome to her palace, and when they had finished supper she told him of the loss
of her husband, and how there was no one left to govern the kingdom but herself.

'But where is the Princess Lineik?' asked the prince when she had ended her tale.

'Here,' answered the queen, bringing forward the girl, whom she had hitherto kept in the background.

The prince looked at her and was rather disappointed. The maiden was pretty enough, but not
much out of the common.

'Oh, you must not wonder at her pale face and heavy eyes,' said the queen hastily, for she
saw what was passing in his mind. 'She has never got over the loss of both father and mother.'

'That shows a good heart,' thought the prince; 'and when she is happy her beauty will soon
come back.' And without any further delay he begged the queen to consent to their betrothal,
for the marriage must take place in his own country.

The queen was enchanted. She had hardly expected to succeed so soon, and she at once set about
her preparations. Indeed she wished to travel with the young couple, to make sure that nothing
should go wrong; but here the prince was firm, that he would take no one with him but Laufer,
whom he thought was Lineik.

They soon took leave of the queen, and set sail in a splendid ship; but in a short time a dense
fog came on, and in the dark the captain steered out of his course, and they found themselves
in a bay which was quite strange to all the crew. The prince ordered a boat to be lowered,
and went on shore to look about him, and it was not long before he noticed the two beautiful
trees, quite different from any that grew in Greece. Calling one of the sailors, he bade him
cut them down, and carry them on board the ship. This was done, and as the sky was now clear
they put out to sea, and arrived in Greece without any more adventures.

The news that the prince had brought home a bride had gone before them, and they were greeted
with flowery arches and crowns of coloured lights. The king and queen met them on the steps
of the palace, and conducted the girl to the women's house, where she would have to remain
until her marriage. The prince then went to his own rooms and ordered that the trees should
be brought in to him.

The next morning the prince bade his attendants bring his future bride to his own apartments,
and when she came he gave her silk which she was to weave into three robes--one red, one green,
and one blue--and these must all be ready before the wedding. The blue one was to be done first
and the green last, and this was to be the most splendid of all, 'for I will wear it at our
marriage,' said he.

Left alone, Laufer sat and stared at the heap of shining silk before her. She did not know
how to weave, and burst into tears as she thought that everything would be discovered, for
Lineik's skill in weaving was as famous as her beauty. As she sat with her face hidden and
her body shaken by sobs, Sigurd in his tree heard her and was moved to pity. 'Lineik, my sister,'
he called, softly, 'Laufer is weeping; help her, I pray you.'

'Have you forgotten the wrongs her mother did to us' answered Lineik, 'and that it is owing
to her that we are banished from home?'

But she was not really unforgiving, and very soon she slid quietly out of her hiding-place,
and taking the silk from Laufer's hands began to weave it. So quick and clever was she that
the blue dress was not only woven but embroidered, and Lineik was safe back in her tree before
the prince returned.

'It is the most beautiful work I have ever seen,' said he, taking up a bit. 'And I am sure
that the red one will be still better, because the stuff is richer,' and with a low bow he
left the room.

Laufer had hoped secretly that when the prince had seen the blue dress finished he would have
let her off the other two; but when she found she was expected to fulfil the whole task, her
heart sank and she began to cry loudly. Again Sigurd heard her, and begged Lineik to come to
her help, and Lineik, feeling sorry for her distress, wove and embroidered the second dress
as she had done the first, mixing gold thread and precious stones till you could hardly see
the red of the stuff. When it was done she glided into her tree just as the prince came in.

'You are as quick as you are clever,' said he, admiringly. 'This looks as if it had been embroidered
by the fairies! But as the green robe must outshine the other two I will give you three days
in which to finish it. After it is ready we will be married at once.'

Now, as he spoke, there rose up in Laufer's mind all the unkind things that she and her mother
had done to Lineik. Could she hope that they would be forgotten, and that Lineik would come
to her rescue for the third time? And perhaps Lineik, who had not forgotten the past either,
might have left her alone, to get on as best she could, had not Sigurd, her brother, implored
her to help just once more. So Lineik again slid out of her tree, and, to Laufer's great relief,
set herself to work. When the shining green silk was ready she caught the sun's rays and the
moon's beams on the point of her needle and wove them into a pattern such as no man had ever
seen. But it took a long time, and on the third morning, just as she was putting the last stitches
into the last flower the prince came in.

Lineik jumped up quickly, and tried to get past him back to her tree; but the folds of the
silk were wrapped round her, and she would have fallen had not the prince caught her.

'I have thought for some time that all was not quite straight here,' said he. 'Tell me who
you are, and where you come from?'

Lineik then told her name and her story. When she had ended the prince turned angrily to Laufer,
and declared that, as a punishment for her wicked lies, she deserved to die a shameful death.

But Laufer fell at his feet and begged for mercy. It was her mother's fault, she said: 'It
was she, and not I, who passed me off as the Princess Lineik. The only lie I have ever told
you was about the robes, and I do not deserve death for that.'

She was still on her knees when Prince Sigurd entered the room. He prayed the Prince of Greece
to forgive Laufer, which he did, on condition that Lineik would consent to marry him. 'Not
till my stepmother is dead,' answered she, 'for she has brought misery to all that came near
her.' Then Laufer told them that Blauvor was not the wife of a king, but an ogress who had
stolen her from a neighbouring palace and had brought her up as her daughter. And besides being
an ogress she was also a witch, and by her black arts had sunk the ship in which the father
of Sigurd and Lineik had set sail. It was she who had caused the disappearance of the courtiers,
for which no one could account, by eating them during the night, and she hoped to get rid of
all the people in the country, and then to fill the land with ogres and ogresses like herself.

So Prince Sigurd and the Prince of Greece collected an army swiftly, and marched upon the town
where Blauvor had her palace. They came so suddenly that no one knew of it, and if they had,
Blauvor had eaten most of the strong men; and others, fearful of something they could not tell
what, had secretly left the place. Therefore she was easily captured, and the next day was
beheaded in the market-place. Afterwards the two princes marched back to Greece.

Lineik had no longer any reason for putting off her wedding, and married the Prince of Greece
at the same time that Sigurd married the princess. And Laufer remained with Lineik as her friend
and sister, till they found a husband for her in a great nobleman; and all three couples lived
happily until they died.

The Six Hungry Beasts

Once upon a time there lived a man who dwelt with his wife in a little hut, far away from any
neighbours. But they did not mind being alone, and would have been quite happy, if it had not
been for a marten, who came every night to their poultry yard, and carried off one of their
fowls. The man laid all sorts of traps to catch the thief, but instead of capturing the foe,
it happened that one day he got caught himself, and falling down, struck his head against a
stone, and was killed.

Not long after the marten came by on the look out for his supper. Seeing the dead man lying
there, he said to himself: 'That is a prize, this time I have done well'; and dragging the
body with great difficulty to the sledge which was waiting for him, drove off with his booty.
He had not driven far when he met a squirrel, who bowed and said: 'Good-morning, godfather!
what have you got behind you?'

The marten laughed and answered: 'Did you ever hear anything so strange? The old man that you
see here set traps about his hen-house, thinking to catch me but he fell into his own trap,
and broke his own neck. He is very heavy; I wish you would help me to draw the sledge.' The
squirrel did as he was asked, and the sledge moved slowly along.

By-and-by a hare came running across a field, but stopped to see what wonderful thing was coming.
'What have you got there?' she asked, and the marten told his story and begged the hare to
help them pull.

The hare pulled her hardest, and after a while they were joined by a fox, and then by a wolf,
and at length a bear was added to the company, and he was of more use than all the other five
beasts put together. Besides, when the whole six had supped off the man he was not so heavy
to draw.

The worst of it was that they soon began to get hungry again, and the wolf, who was the hungriest
of all, said to the rest:

'What shall we eat now, my friends, as there is no more man?'

'I suppose we shall have to eat the smallest of us,' replied the bear, and the marten turned
round to seize the squirrel who was much smaller than any of the rest. But the squirrel ran
up a tree like lightning, and the marten remembering, just in time, that he was the next in
size, slipped quick as thought into a hole in the rocks.

'What shall we eat now?' asked the wolf again, when he had recovered from his surprise.

'We must eat the smallest of us,' repeated the bear, stretching out a paw towards the hare;
but the hare was not a hare for nothing, and before the paw had touched her, she had darted
deep into the wood.

Now that the squirrel, the marten, and the hare had all gone, the fox was the smallest of the
three who were left, and the wolf and the bear explained that they were very sorry, but they
would have to eat him. Michael, the fox, did not run away as the others had done, but smiled
in a friendly manner, and remarked: 'Things taste so stale in a valley; one's appetite is so
much better up on a mountain.' The wolf and the bear agreed, and they turned out of the hollow
where they had been walking, and chose a path that led up the mountain side. The fox trotted
cheerfully by his two big companions, but on the way he managed to whisper to the wolf: 'Tell
me, Peter, when I am eaten, what will you have for your next dinner?'

This simple question seemed to put out the wolf very much. What would they have for their next
dinner, and, what was more important still, who would there be to eat it? They had made a rule
always to dine off the smallest of the party, and when the fox was gone, why of course, he
was smaller than the bear.

These thoughts flashed quickly through his head, and he said hastily:

'Dear brothers, would it not be better for us to live together as comrades, and everyone to
hunt for the common dinner? Is not my plan a good one?'

'It is the best thing I have ever heard,' answered the fox; and as they were two to one the
bear had to be content, though in his heart he would much have preferred a good dinner at once
to any friendship.

For a few days all went well; there was plenty of game in the forest, and even the wolf had
as much to eat as he could wish. One morning the fox as usual was going his rounds when he
noticed a tall, slender tree, with a magpie's nest in one of the top branches. Now the fox
was particularly fond of young magpies, and he set about making a plan by which he could have
one for dinner. At last he hit upon something which he thought would do, and accordingly he
sat down near the tree and began to stare hard at it.

'What are you looking at, Michael?' asked the magpie, who was watching him from a bough.

'I'm looking at this tree. It has just struck me what a good tree it would be to cut my new
snow-shoes out of.' But at this answer the magpie screeched loudly, and exclaimed: 'Oh, not
this tree, dear brother, I implore you! I have built my nest on it, and my young ones are not
yet old enough to fly.'

'It will not be easy to find another tree that would make such good snow-shoes,' answered the
fox, cocking his head on one side, and gazing at the tree thoughtfully; 'but I do not like
to be ill-natured, so if you will give me one of your young ones I will seek my snow-shoes
elsewhere.'

Not knowing what to do the poor magpie had to agree, and flying back, with a heavy heart, he
threw one of his young ones out of the nest. The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in
triumph, while the magpie, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one, found some
comfort in the thought that only a bird of extraordinary wisdom would have dreamed of saving
the rest by the sacrifice of the one. But what do you think happened? Why, a few days later,
Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree, and a dreadful pang
shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.

'What are you looking at?' he asked in a trembling voice.

'At this tree. I was just thinking what good snowshoes it would make,' answered the fox in
an absent voice, as if he was not thinking of what he was saying.

'Oh, my brother, my dear little brother, don't do that,' cried the magpie, hopping about in
his anguish. 'You know you promised only a few days ago that you would get your snow-shoes
elsewhere.'

'So I did; but though I have searched through the whole forest, there is not a single tree
that is as good as this. I am very sorry to put you out, but really it is not my fault. The
only thing I can do for you is to offer to give up my snow-shoes altogether if you will throw
me down one of your young ones in exchange.'

And the poor magpie, in spite of his wisdom, was obliged to throw another of his little ones
out of the nest; and this time he was not able to console himself with the thought that he
had been much cleverer than other people.

He sat on the edge of his nest, his head drooping and his feathers all ruffled, looking the
picture of misery. Indeed he was so different from the gay, jaunty magpie whom every creature
in the forest knew, that a crow who was flying past, stopped to inquire what was the matter.
'Where are the two young ones who are not in the nest?' asked he.

'I had to give them to the fox,' replied the magpie in a quivering voice; 'he has been here
twice in the last week, and wanted to cut down my tree for the purpose of making snow-shoes
out of it, and the only way I could buy him off was by giving him two of my young ones.'

Oh, you fool,' cried the crow, 'the fox was only trying to frighten you. He could not have
cut down the tree, for he has neither axe nor knife. Dear me, to think that you have sacrificed
your young ones for nothing! Dear, dear! how could you be so very foolish!' And the crow flew
away, leaving the magpie overcome with shame and sorrow.

The next morning the fox came to his usual place in front of the tree, for he was hungry, and
a nice young magpie would have suited him very well for dinner. But this time there was no
cowering, timid magpie to do his bidding, but a bird with his head erect and a determined voice.

'My good fox,' said the magpie putting his head on one side and looking very wise--'my good
fox, if you take my advice, you will go home as fast as you can. There is no use your talking
about making snow-shoes out of this tree, when you have neither knife nor axe to cut it down with!'

'Who has been teaching you wisdom?' asked the fox, forgetting his manners in his surprise at
this new turn of affairs.

'The crow, who paid me a visit yesterday,' answered the magpie.

'The crow was it?' said the fox, 'well, the crow had better not meet me for the future, or
it may be the worse for him.'

As Michael, the cunning beast, had no desire to continue the conversation, he left the forest;
but when he came to the high road he laid himself at full length on the ground, stretching
himself out, just as if he was dead. Very soon he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, that
the crow was flying towards him, and he kept stiller and stiffer than ever, with his tongue
hanging out of his mouth. The crow, who wanted her supper very badly, hopped quickly towards
him, and was stooping forward to peck at his tongue when the fox gave a snap, and caught him
by the wing. The crow knew that it was of no use struggling, so he said:

'Ah, brother, if you are really going to eat me, do it, I beg of you, in good style. Throw
me first over this precipice, so that my feathers may be strewn here and there, and that all
who see them may know that your cunning is greater than mine.' This idea pleased the fox, for
he had not yet forgiven the crow for depriving him of the young magpies, so he carried the
crow to the edge of the precipice and threw him over, intending to go round by a path he knew
and pick him up at the bottom. But no sooner had the fox let the crow go than he soared up
into the air, and hovering just out of teach of his enemy's jaws, he cried with a laugh: 'Ah,
fox! you know well how to catch, but you cannot keep.'

With his tail between his legs, the fox slunk into the forest. He did not know where to look
for a dinner, as he guessed that the crow would have flown back before him, and put every one
on their guard. The notion of going to bed supperless was very unpleasant to him, and he was
wondering what in the world he should do, when he chanced to meet with his old friend the bear.

This poor animal had just lost his wife, and was going to get some one to mourn over her, for
he felt her loss greatly. He had hardly left his comfortable cave when he had come across the
wolf, who inquired where he was going. 'I am going to find a mourner,' answered the bear, and
told his story.

'Oh, let me mourn for you,' cried the wolf.

'Do you understand how to howl?' said the bear.

'Oh, certainly, godfather, certainly,' replied the wolf; but the bear said he should like to
have a specimen of his howling, to make sure that he knew his business. So the wolf broke forth
in his song of lament: 'Hu, hu, hu, hum, hoh,' he shouted, and he made such a noise that the
bear put up his paws to his ears, and begged him to stop.

'You have no idea how it is done. Be off with you,' said he angrily.

A little further down the road the hare was resting in a ditch, but when she saw the bear,
she came out and spoke to him, and inquired why he looked so sad. The bear told her of the
loss of his wife, and of his search after a mourner that could lament over her in the proper
style. The hare instantly offered her services, but the bear took care to ask her to give him
a proof of her talents, before he accepted them. 'Pu, pu, pu, pum, poh,' piped the hare; but
this time her voice was so small that the bear could hardly hear her. 'That is not what I want,'
he said, 'I will bid you good morning.'

It was after this that the fox came up, and he also was struck with the bear's altered looks,
and stopped. 'What is the matter with you, godfather?' asked he, 'and where are you going?'

'I am going to find a mourner for my wife,' answered the bear.

'Oh, do choose me,' cried the fox, and the bear looked at him thoughtfully.

'Can you howl well?' he said.

'Yes, beautifully, just listen,' and the fox lifted up his voice and sang weeping: 'Lou, lou,
lou! the famous spinner, the baker of good cakes, the prudent housekeeper is torn from her
husband! Lou, lou, lou! she is gone! she is gone!'

'Now at last I have found some one who knows the art of lamentation,' exclaimed the bear, quite
delighted; and he led the fox back to his cave, and bade him begin his lament over the dead
wife who was lying stretched out on her bed of grey moss. But this did not suit the fox at all.

'One cannot wail properly in this cave,' he said, 'it is much too damp. You had better take
the body to the storehouse. It will sound much finer there.' So the bear carried his wife's
body to the storehouse, while he himself went back to the cave to cook some pap for the mourner.
From time to time he paused and listened for the sound of wailing, but he heard nothing. At
last he went to the door of the storehouse, and called to the fox:

'Why don't you howl, godfather? What are you about?'

And the fox, who, instead of weeping over the dead bear, had been quietly eating her, answered:

'There only remain now her legs and the soles of her feet. Give me five minutes more and they
will be gone also!'

When the bear heard that he ran back for the kitchen ladle, to give the traitor the beating
he deserved. But as he opened the door of the storehouse, Michael was ready for him, and slipping
between his legs, dashed straight off into the forest. The bear, seeing that the traitor had
escaped, flung the ladle after him, and it just caught the tip of his tail, and that is how
there comes to be a spot of white on the tails of all foxes.

How The Beggar Boy Turned Into Count Piro

Once upon a time there lived a man who had only one son, a lazy, stupid boy, who would never
do anything he was told. When the father was dying, he sent for his son and told him that he
would soon be left alone in the world, with no possessions but the small cottage they lived
in and a pear tree which grew behind it, and that, whether he liked it or not, he would have
to work, or else he would starve. Then the old man died.

But the boy did not work; instead, he idled about as before, contenting himself with eating
the pears off his tree, which, unlike other pear trees before or since, bore fruit the whole
year round. Indeed, the pears were so much finer than any you could get even in the autumn,
that one day, in the middle of the winter, they attracted the notice of a fox who was creeping by.

'Dear me; what lovely pears!' he said to the youth. 'Do give me a basket of them. It will bring
you luck!'

'Ah, little fox, but if I give you a basketful, what am I to eat?' asked the boy.

'Oh, trust me, and do what I tell you,' said the fox; 'I know it will bring you luck.' So the
boy got up and picked some of the ripest pears and put them into a rush basket. The fox thanked
him, and, taking the basket in his mouth, trotted off to the king's palace and made his way
straight to the king.

'Your Majesty, my master sends you a few of his best pears, and begs you will graciously accept
them,' he said, laying the basket at the feet of the king.

'Pears! at this season?' cried the king, peering down to look at them; 'and, pray, who is your
master?'

'The Count Piro,' answered the fox.

'But how does he manage to get pears in midwinter?' asked the king.

'Oh, he has everything he wants,' replied the fox; 'he is richer even than you are, your Majesty.'

'Then what can I send him in return for his pears?' said the king.

'Nothing, your Majesty, or you would hurt his feelings,' answered the fox.

'Well, tell him how heartily I thank him, and how much I shall enjoy them.' And the fox went away.

He trotted back to the cottage with his empty basket and told his tale, but the youth did not
seem as pleased to hear as the fox was to tell.

'But, my dear little fox,' said he, 'you have brought me nothing in return, and I am so hungry!'

'Let me alone,' replied the fox; 'I know what I am doing. You will see, it will bring you luck.'

A few days after this the fox came back again.

'I must have another basket of pears,' said he.

'Ah, little fox, what shall I eat if you take away all my pears?' answered the youth.

'Be quiet, it will be all right,' said the fox; and taking a bigger basket than before, he
filled it quite full of pears. Then he picked it up in his mouth, and trotted off to the palace.

'Your Majesty, as you seemed to like the first basket of pears, I have brought you some more,'
said he, 'with my master, the Count Piro's humble respects.'

'Now, surely it is not possible to grow such pears with deep snow on the ground?' cried the king.

'Oh, that never affects them,' answered the fox lightly; 'he is rich enough to do anything.
But to-day he sends me to ask if you will give him your daughter in marriage?'

'If he is so much richer than I am,' said the king, 'I shall be obliged to refuse. My honour
would not permit me to accept his offer.'

'Oh, your Majesty, you must not think that,' replied the fox; 'and do not let the question
of a dowry trouble you. The Count Piro would not dream of asking anything but the hand of the
princess.'

'Is he really so rich that he can do without a dowry?' asked the king.

'Did I not tell your Majesty that he was richer than you?' answered the fox reproachfully.

'Well, beg him to come here, that we may talk together,' said the king.

So the fox went back to the young man and said: 'I have told the king that you are Count Piro,
and have asked his daughter in marriage.'

'Oh, little fox, what have you done?' cried the youth in dismay; 'when the king sees me he
will order my head to be cut off.'

'Oh, no, he won't!' replied the fox; 'just do as I tell you.' And he went off to the town,
and stopped at the house of the best tailor.

'My master, the Count Piro, begs that you will send him at once the finest coat that you have
in your shop,' said the fox, putting on his grandest air, 'and if it fits him I will call and
pay for it to-morrow! Indeed, as he is in a great hurry, perhaps it might be as well if I took
it round myself.' The tailor was not accustomed to serve counts, and he at once got out all
the coats he had ready. The fox chose out a beautiful one of white and silver, bade the tailor
tie it up in a parcel, and carrying the string in his teeth, he left the shop, and went to
a horse-dealer's, whom he persuaded to send his finest horse round to the cottage, saying that
the king had bidden his master to the palace.

Very unwillingly the young man put on the coat and mounted the horse, and rode up to meet the
king, with the fox running before him.

'What am I to say to his Majesty, little fox?' he asked anxiously; 'you know that I have never
spoken to a king before.'

'Say nothing,' answered the fox, 'but leave the talking to me. "Good morning, your Majesty,"
will be all that is necessary for you.'

By this time they had reached the palace, and the king came to the door to receive Count Piro,
and led him to the great hall, where a feast was spread. The princess was already seated at
the table, but was as dumb as Count Piro himself.

'The Count speaks very little,' the king said at last to the fox, and the fox answered: 'He
has so much to think about in the management of his property that he cannot afford to talk
like ordinary people.' The king was quite satisfied, and they finished dinner, after which
Count Piro and the fox took leave.

The next morning the fox came round again.

'Give me another basket of pears,' he said.

'Very well, little fox; but remember it may cost me my life,' answered the youth.

'Oh, leave it to me, and do as I tell you, and you will see that in the end it will bring you
luck,' answered the fox; and plucking the pears he took them up to the king.

'My master, Count Piro, sends you these pears,' he said, 'and asks for an answer to his proposal.'

'Tell the count that the wedding can take place whenever he pleases,' answered the king, and,
filled with pride, the fox trotted back to deliver his message.

'But I can't bring the princess here, little fox?' cried the young man in dismay.

'You leave everything to me,' answered the fox; 'have I not managed well so far?'

And up at the palace preparations were made for a grand wedding, and the youth was married
to the princess.

After a week of feasting, the fox said to the king: 'My master wishes to take his young bride
home to his own castle.'

'Very well, I will accompany them,' replied the king; and he ordered his courtiers and attendants
to get ready, and the best horses in his stable to be brought out for himself, Count Piro and
the princess. So they all set out, and rode across the plain, the little fox running before them.

He stopped at the sight of a great flock of sheep, which was feeding peacefully on the rich
grass. 'To whom do these sheep belong?' asked he of the shepherd. 'To an ogre,' replied the
shepherd.

'Hush,' said the fox in a mysterious manner. 'Do you see that crowd of armed men riding along?
If you were to tell them that those sheep belonged to an ogre, they would kill them, and then
the ogre would kill you! If they ask, just say the sheep belong to Count Piro; it will be better
for everybody.' And the fox ran hastily on, as he did not wish to be seen talking to the shepherd.

Very soon the king came up.

'What beautiful sheep!' he said, drawing up his horse. 'I have none so fine in my pastures.
Whose are they?'

'Count Piro's,' answered the shepherd, who did not know the king.

'Well, he must be a very rich man,' thought the king to himself, and rejoiced that he had such
a wealthy son-in-law.

Meanwhile the fox had met with a huge herd of pigs, snuffling about the roots of some trees.

'To whom do these pigs belong?' he asked of the swineherd.

'To an ogre,' replied he.

'Hush!' whispered the fox, though nobody could hear him; 'do you see that troop of armed men
riding towards us? If you tell them that the pigs belong to the ogre they will kill them, and
then the ogre will kill you! If they ask, just say that the pigs belong to Count Piro; it will
be better for everybody.' And he ran hastily on.

Soon after the king rode up.

'What fine pigs!' he said, reining in his horse. 'They are fatter than any I have got on my
farms. Whose are they?'

'Count Piro's,' answered the swineherd, who did not know the king; and again the king felt
he was lucky to have such a rich son-in-law.

This time the fox ran faster than before, and in a flowery meadow he found a troop of horses
feeding. 'Whose horses are these?' he asked of the man who was watching them.

'An ogre's,' replied he.

'Hush!' whispered the fox, 'do you see that crowd of armed men coming towards us? If you tell
them the horses belong to an ogre they will drive them off, and then the ogre will kill you!
If they ask, just say they are Count Piro's; it will be better for everybody.' And he ran on again.

In a few minutes the king rode up.

'Oh, what lovely creatures! how I wish they were mine!' he exclaimed. 'Whose are they?'

Count Piro's,' answered the man, who did not know the king; and the king's heart leapt as he
thought that if they belonged to his rich son-in-law they were as good as his.

At last the fox came to the castle of the ogre himself. He ran up the steps, with tears falling
from his eyes, and crying:

'Oh, you poor, poor people, what a sad fate is yours!'

'What has happened?' asked the ogre, trembling with fright.

'Do you see that troop of horsemen who are riding along the road? They are sent by the king
to kill you!'

'Oh, dear little fox, help us, we implore you!' cried the ogre and his wife.

'Well, I will do what I can,' answered the fox. 'The best place is for you both to hide in
the big oven, and when the soldiers have gone by I will let you out.'

The ogre and ogress scrambled into the oven as quick as thought, and the fox banged the door
on them; just as he did so the king came up.

'Do us the honour to dismount, your Majesty,' said the fox, bowing low. 'This is the palace
of Count Piro!'

'Why it is more splendid than my own!' exclaimed the king, looking round on all the beautiful
things that filled the hall. But why are there no servants?'

'His Excellency the Count Piro wished the princess to choose them for herself,' answered the
fox, and the king nodded his approval. He then rode on, leaving the bridal pair in the castle.
But when it was dark and all was still, the fox crept downstairs and lit the kitchen fire,
and the ogre and his wife were burned to death. The next morning the fox said to Count Piro:

'Now that you are rich and happy, you have no more need of me; but, before I go, there is one
thing I must ask of you in return: when I die, promise me that you will give me a magnificent
coffin, and bury me with due honours.'

'Oh, little, little fox, don't talk of dying,' cried the princess, nearly weeping, for she
had taken a great liking to the fox.

After some time the fox thought he would see if the Count Piro was really grateful to him for
all he had done, and went back to the castle, where he lay down on the door-step, and pretended
to be dead. The princess was just going out for a walk, and directly she saw him lying there,
she burst into tears and fell on her knees beside him.

'My dear little fox, you are not dead,' she wailed; 'you poor, poor little creature, you shall
have the finest coffin in the world!'

'A coffin for an animal?' said Count Piro. 'What nonsense! just take him by the leg and throw
him into the ditch.'

Then the fox sprang up and cried: 'You wretched, thankless beggar; have you forgotten that
you owe all your riches to me?'

Count Piro was frightened when he heard these words, as he thought that perhaps the fox might
have power to take away the castle, and leave him as poor as when he had nothing to eat but

in joke, as he had known quite well that he was not really dead. For the sake of the princess,
the fox let himself be softened, and he lived in the castle for many years, and played with
Count Piro's children. And when he actually did die, his coffin was made of silver, and Count
Piro and his wife followed him to the grave.

[From Sicilianische Mahrchen.]

The Rogue And The Herdsman

In a tiny cottage near the king's palace there once lived an old man, his wife, and his son,
a very lazy fellow, who would never do a stroke of work. He could not be got even to look after
their one cow, but left her to look after herself, while he lay on a bank and went to sleep
in the sun. For a long time his father bore with him, hoping that as he grew older he might
gain more sense; but at last the old man's patience was worn out, and he told his son that
he should not stay at house in idleness, and must go out into the world to seek his fortune.

The young man saw that there was no help for it, and he set out with a wallet full of food
over his shoulder. At length he came to a large house, at the door of which he knocked.

'What do you want?' asked the old man who opened it. And the youth told him how his father
had turned him out of his house because he was so lazy and stupid, and he needed shelter for
the night.

'That you shall have,' replied the man; 'but to-morrow I shall give you some work to do, for
you must know that I am the chief herdsman of the king.'

The youth made no answer to this. He felt, if he was to be made to work after all, that he
might as well have stayed where he was. But as he did not see any other way of getting a bed,
he went slowly in.

The herdsman's two daughters and their mother were sitting at supper, and invited him to join
them. Nothing more was said about work, and when the meal was over they all went to bed.

In the morning, when the young man was dressed, the herdsman called to him and said:

'Now listen, and I will tell you what you have to do.'

'What is it?' asked the youth, sulkily.

'Nothing less than to look after two hundred pigs,' was the reply.

'Oh, I am used to that,' answered the youth.

'Yes; but this time you will have to do it properly,' said the herdsman; and he took the youth
to the place where the pigs were feeding, and told him to drive them to the woods on the side
of the mountain. This the young man did, but as soon as they reached the outskirts of the mountain
they grew quite wild, and would have run away altogether, had they not luckily gone towards
a narrow ravine, from which the youth easily drove them home to his father's cottage.

'Where do all these pigs come from, and how did you get them?' asked the old man in surprise,
when his son knocked at the door of the hut he had left only the day before.

'They belong to the king's chief herdsman,' answered his son. 'He gave them to me to look after,
but I knew I could not do it, so I drove them straight to you. Now make the best of your good
fortune, and kill them and hang them up at once.'

'What are you talking about?' cried the father, pale with horror. 'We should certainly both
be put to death if I did any such thing.'

'No, no; do as I tell you, and I will get out of it somehow,' replied the young man. And in
the end he had his way. The pigs were killed, and laid side by side in a row. Then he cut off
the tails and tied them together with a piece of cord, and swinging the bundle over his back,
he returned to the place where they should have been feeding. Here there was a small swamp,
which was just what he wanted, and finding a large stone, he fastened the rope to it, and sank
it in the swamp, after which he arranged the tails carefully one by one, so that only their
points were seen sticking out of the water. When everything was in order, he hastened home
to his master with such a sorrowful face that the herdsman saw at once that something dreadful
had happened.

'Where are the pigs?' asked he.

'Oh, don't speak of them!' answered the young man; 'I really can hardly tell you. The moment
they got into the field they became quite mad, and each ran in a different direction. I ran
too, hither and thither, but as fast as I caught one, another was off, till I was in despair.
At last, however, I collected them all and was about to drive them back, when suddenly they
rushed down the hill into the swamp, where they vanished completely, leaving only the points
of their tails, which you can see for yourself.'

'You have made up that story very well,' replied the herdsman.

'No, it is the real truth; come with me and I'll prove it.' And they went together to the spot,
and there sure enough were the points of the tails sticking up out of the water. The herdsman
laid hold of the nearest, and pulled at it with all his might, but it was no use, for the stone
and the rope held them all fast. He called to the young man to help him, but the two did not
succeed any better than the one had done.

'Yes, your story was true after all; it is a wonderful thing,' said the herdsman. 'But I see
it is no fault of yours, and I must put up with my loss as well as I can. Now let us return
home, for it is time for supper.

Next morning the herdsman said to the young man: 'I have got some other work for you to do.
To-day you must take a hundred sheep to graze; but be careful that no harm befalls them.'

'I will do my best,' replied the youth. And he opened the gate of the fold, where the sheep
had been all night, and drove them out into the meadow. But in a short time they grew as wild
as the pigs had done, and scattered in all directions. The young man could not collect them,
try as he would, and he thought to himself that this was the punishment for his laziness in
refusing to look after his father's one cow.

At last, however, the sheep seemed tired of running about, and then the youth managed to gather
them together, and drove them, as before, straight to his father's house.

'Whose sheep are these, and what are they doing here?' asked the old man in wonder, and his
son told him. But when the tale was ended the father shook his head.

'Give up these bad ways and take them back to your master,' said he.

'No, no,' answered the youth; 'I am not so stupid as that! We will kill them and have them
for dinner.'

'You will lose your life if you do,' replied the father.

'Oh, I am not sure of that!' said the son, 'and, anyway, I will have my will for once.' And
he killed all the sheep and laid them on the grass. But he cut off the head of the ram which
always led the flock and had bells round its horns. This he took back to the place where they
should have been feeding, for here he had noticed a high rock, with a patch of green grass
in the middle and two or three thick bushes growing on the edge. Up this rock he climbed with
great difficulty, and fastened the ram's head to the bushes with a cord, leaving only the tips
of the horns with the bells visible. As there was a soft breeze blowing, the bushes to which
the head was tied moved gently, and the bells rang. When all was done to his liking he hastened
quickly back to his master.

'Where are the sheep?' asked the herdsman as the young man ran panting up the steps.

'Oh! don't speak of them,' answered he. 'It is only by a miracle that I am here myself.'

'Tell me at once what has happened,' said the herdsman sternly.

The youth began to sob, and stammered out: 'I--I hardly know how to tell you! They--they--they
were so--so troublesome--that I could not manage them at all. They--ran about in--in all directions,
and I--I--ran after them and nearly died of fatigue. Then I heard a--a noise, which I--I thought
was the wind. But--but--it was the sheep, which, be--before my very eyes, were carried straight
up--up into the air. I stood watching them as if I was turned to stone, but there kept ringing
in my ears the sound of the bells on the ram which led them.'

'That is nothing but a lie from beginning to end,' said the herdsman.

'No, it is as true as that there is a sun in heaven,' answered the young man.

'Then give me a proof of it,' cried his master.

'Well, come with me,' said the youth. By this time it was evening and the dusk was falling.
The young man brought the herdsman to the foot of the great rock, but it was so dark you could
hardly see. [Clark, Shrub 1, 1806] Workday Whitethorn 1st 1806. The obedient morning we collected

 When he hears that perhaps he will give us something.'

'Yes, that is a good plan,' said the wife; and Abu Nowas set out.

The Sultan was sitting in the hall of justice when Abu Nowas entered, his eyes streaming with
tears, for he had rubbed some pepper into them. They smarted dreadfully, and he could hardly
see to walk straight, and everyone wondered what was the matter with him.

'Abu Nowas! What has happened?' cried the Sultan.

'Oh, noble Sultan, my wife is dead,' wept he.

'We must all die,' answered the Sultan; but this was not the reply for which Abu Nowas had hoped.

'True, O Sultan, but I have neither shroud to wrap her in, nor money to bury her with,' went
on Abu Nowas, in no wise abashed by the way the Sultan had received his news.

'Well, give him a hundred pieces of gold,' said the Sultan, turning to the Grand Vizir. And
when the money was counted out Abu Nowas bowed low, and left the hall, his tears still flowing,
but with joy in his heart.

'Have you got anything?' cried his wife, who was waiting for him anxiously.

'Yes, a hundred gold pieces,' said he, throwing down the bag, 'but that will not last us any
time. Now you must go to the Sultana, clothed in sackcloth and robes of mourning, and tell
her that your husband, Abu Nowas, is dead, and you have no money for his burial. When she hears
that, she will be sure to ask you what has become of the money and the fine clothes she gave
us on our marriage, and you will answer, "before he died he sold everything."'

The wife did as she was told, and wrapping herself in sackcloth went up to the Sultana's own
palace, and as she was known to have been one of Subida's favourite attendants, she was taken
without difficulty into the private apartments.

'What is the matter?' inquired the Sultana, at the sight of the dismal figure.

'My husband lies dead at home, and he has spent all our money, and sold everything, and I have
nothing left to bury him with,' sobbed the wife.

Then Subida took up a purse containing two hundred gold pieces, and said: 'Your husband served
us long and faithfully. You must see that he has a fine funeral.'

The wife took the money, and, kissing the feet of the Sultana, she joyfully hastened home.
They spent some happy hours planning how they should spend it, and thinking how clever they
had been. 'When the Sultan goes this evening to Subida's palace,' said Abu Nowas, 'she will
be sure to tell him that Abu Nowas is dead. "Not Abu Nowas, it is his wife," he will reply,
and they will quarrel over it, and all the time we shall be sitting here enjoying ourselves.
Oh, if they only knew, how angry they would be!'

As Abu Nowas had foreseen, the Sultan went, in the evening after his business was over, to
pay his usual visit to the Sultana.

'Poor Abu Nowas is dead!' said Subida when he entered the room.

'It is not Abu Nowas, but his wife who is dead,' answered the Sultan.

'No; really you are quite wrong. She came to tell me herself only a couple of hours ago,' replied
Subida, 'and as he had spent all their money, I gave her something to bury him with.'

'You must be dreaming,' exclaimed the Sultan. 'Soon after midday Abu Nowas came into the hall,
his eyes streaming with tears, and when I asked him the reason he answered that his wife was
dead, and they had sold everything they had, and he had nothing left, not so much as would
buy her a shroud, far less for her burial.'

For a long time they talked, and neither would listen to the other, till the Sultan sent for
the door-keeper and bade him go instantly to the house of Abu Nowas and see if it was the man
or his wife who was dead. But Abu Nowas happened to be sitting with his wife behind the latticed
window, which looked on the street, and he saw the man coming, and sprang up at once. 'There
is the Sultan's door-keeper! They have sent him here to find out the truth. Quick! throw yourself
on the bed and pretend that you are dead.' And in a moment the wife was stretched out stiffly,
with a linen sheet spread across her, like a corpse.

She was only just in time, for the sheet was hardly drawn across her when the door opened and
the porter came in. 'Has anything happened?' asked he.

'My poor wife is dead,' replied Abu Nowas. 'Look! she is laid out here.' And the porter approached
the bed, which was in a corner of the room, and saw the stiff form lying underneath.

'We must all die,' said he, and went back to the Sultan.

'Well, have you found out which of them is dead?' asked the Sultan.

'Yes, noble Sultan; it is the wife,' replied the porter.

'He only says that to please you,' cried Subida in a rage; and calling to her chamberlain,
she ordered him to go at once to the dwelling of Abu Nowas and see which of the two was dead.
'And be sure you tell the truth about it,' added she, 'or it will be the worse for you.'

As her chamberlain drew near the house, Abu Nowas caught sight of him. 'There is the Sultana's
chamberlain,' he exclaimed in a fright. 'Now it is my turn to die. Be quick and spread the
sheet over me.' And he laid himself on the bed, and held his breath when the chamberlain came
in. 'What are you weeping for?' asked the man, finding the wife in tears.

'My husband is dead,' answered she, pointing to the bed; and the chamberlain drew back the
sheet and beheld Abu Nowas lying stiff and motionless. Then he gently replaced the sheet and
returned to the palace.

'Well, have you found out this time?' asked the Sultan.

'My lord, it is the husband who is dead.'

'But I tell you he was with me only a few hours ago,' cried the Sultan angrily. 'I must get
to the bottom of this before I sleep! Let my golden coach be brought round at once.'

The coach was before the door in another five minutes, and the Sultan and Sultana both got
in. Abu Nowas had ceased being a dead man, and was looking into the street when he saw the
coach coming. 'Quick! quick!' he called to his wife. 'The Sultan will be here directly, and
we must both be dead to receive him.' So they laid themselves down, and spread the sheet over
them, and held their breath. At that instant the Sultan entered, followed by the Sultana and
the chamberlain, and he went up to the bed and found the corpses stiff and motionless. 'I would
give a thousand gold pieces to anyone who would tell me the truth about this,' cried he, and
at the words Abu Nowas sat up. 'Give them to me, then,' said he, holding out his hand. 'You
cannot give them to anyone who needs them more.'

'Oh, Abu Nowas, you impudent dog!' exclaimed the Sultan, bursting into a laugh, in which the
Sultana joined. 'I might have known it was one of your tricks!' But he sent Abu Nowas the gold
he had promised, and let us hope that it did not fly so fast as the last had done.

Motiratika

Once upon a time, in a very hot country, a man lived with his wife in a little hut, which was
surrounded by grass and flowers. They were perfectly happy together till, by-and-by, the woman
fell ill and refused to take any food. The husband tried to persuade her to eat all sorts of
delicious fruits that he had found in the forest, but she would have none of them, and grew
so thin he feared she would die. 'Is there nothing you would like?' he said at last in despair.

'Yes, I think I could eat some wild honey,' answered she. The husband was overjoyed, for he
thought this sounded easy enough to get, and he went off at once in search of it.

He came back with a wooden pan quite full, and gave it to his wife. 'I can't eat that,' she
said, turning away in disgust. 'Look! there are some dead bees in it! I want honey that is
quite pure.' And the man threw the rejected honey on the grass, and started off to get some
fresh. When he got back he offered it to his wife, who treated it as she had done the first
bowlful. 'That honey has got ants in it: throw it away,' she said, and when he brought her
some more, she declared it was full of earth. In his fourth journey he managed to find some
that she would eat, and then she begged him to get her some water. This took him some time,
but at length he came to a lake whose waters were sweetened with sugar. He filled a pannikin
quite full, and carried it home to his wife, who drank it eagerly, and said that she now felt
quite well. When she was up and had dressed herself, her husband lay down in her place, saying:
'You have given me a great deal of trouble, and now it is my turn!'

'What is the matter with you?' asked the wife.

'I am thirsty and want some water,' answered he; and she took a large pot and carried it to
the nearest spring, which was a good way off. 'Here is the water,' she said to her husband,
lifting the heavy pot from her head; but he turned away in disgust.

'You have drawn it from the pool that is full of frogs and willows; you must get me some more.'
So the woman set out again and walked still further to another lake.

'This water tastes of rushes,' he exclaimed, 'go and get some fresh.' But when she brought
back a third supply he declared that it seemed made up of water-lilies, and that he must have
water that was pure, and not spoilt by willows, or frogs, or rushes. So for the fourth time
she put her jug on her head, and passing all the lakes she had hitherto tried, she came to
another, where the water was golden like honey. She stooped down to drink, when a horrible
head bobbed up on the surface.

'How dare you steal my water?' cried the head.

'It is my husband who has sent me,' she replied, trembling all over. 'But do not kill me! You
shall have my baby, if you will only let me go.'

'How am I to know which is your baby?' asked the Ogre.

'Oh, that is easily managed. I will shave both sides of his head, and hang some white beads
round his neck. And when you come to the hut you have only to call "Motikatika!" and he will
run to meet you, and you can eat him.'

'Very well,' said the ogre, 'you can go home.' And after filling the pot she returned, and
told her husband of the dreadful danger she had been in.

Now, though his mother did not know it, the baby was a magician and he had heard all that his
mother had promised the ogre; and he laughed to himself as he planned how to outwit her.

The next morning she shaved his head on both sides, and hung the white beads round his neck,
and said to him: 'I am going to the fields to work, but you must stay at home. Be sure you
do not go outside, or some wild beast may eat you.'

'Very well,' answered he.

As soon as his mother was out of sight, the baby took out some magic bones, and placed them
in a row before him. 'You are my father,' he told one bone, 'and you are my mother. You are
the biggest,' he said to the third, 'so you shall be the ogre who wants to eat me; and you,'
to another, 'are very little, therefore you shall be me. Now, then, tell me what I am to do.'

'Collect all the babies in the village the same size as yourself,' answered the bones; 'shave
the sides of their heads, and hang white beads round their necks, and tell them that when anybody
calls "Motikatika," they are to answer to it. And be quick for you have no time to lose.'

Motikatika went out directly, and brought back quite a crowd of babies, and shaved their heads
and hung white beads round their little black necks, and just as he had finished, the ground
began to shake, and the huge ogre came striding along, crying: 'Motikatika! Motikatika!'

'Here we are! here we are!' answered the babies, all running to meet him.

'It is Motikatika I want,' said the ogre.

'We are all Motikatika,' they replied. And the ogre sat down in bewilderment, for he dared
not eat the children of people who had done him no wrong, or a heavy punishment would befall
him. The children waited for a little, wondering, and then they went away.

The ogre remained where he was, till the evening, when the woman returned from the fields.

'I have not seen Motikatika,' said he.

'But why did you not call him by his name, as I told you?' she asked.

'I did, but all the babies in the village seemed to be named Motikatika,' answered the ogre;
'you cannot think the number who came running to me.'

The woman did not know what to make of it, so, to keep him in a good temper, she entered the
hut and prepared a bowl of maize, which she brought him.

'I do not want maize, I want the baby,' grumbled he 'and I will have him.'

'Have patience,' answered she; 'I will call him, and you can eat him at once.' And she went
into the hut and cried, 'Motikatika!'

'I am coming, mother,' replied he; but first he took out his bones, and, crouching down on
the ground behind the hut, asked them how he should escape the ogre.

'Change yourself into a mouse,' said the bones; and so he did, and the ogre grew tired of waiting,
and told the woman she must invent some other plan.

'To-morrow I will send him into the field to pick some beans for me, and you will find him
there, and can eat him.'

'Very well,' replied the ogre, 'and this time I will take care to have him,' and he went back
to his lake.

Next morning Motikatika was sent out with a basket, and told to pick some beans for dinner.
On the way to the field he took out his bones and asked them what he was to do to escape from
the ogre. 'Change yourself into a bird and snap off the beans,' said the bones. And the ogre
chased away the bird, not knowing that it was Motikatika.

The ogre went back to the hut and told the woman that she had deceived him again, and that
he would not be put off any longer.

'Return here this evening,' answered she, 'and you will find him in bed under this white coverlet.
Then you can carry him away, and eat him at once.'

But the boy heard, and consulted his bones, which said: 'Take the red coverlet from your father's
bed, and put yours on his,' and so he did. And when the ogre came, he seized Motikatika's father
and carried him outside the hut and ate him. When his wife found out the mistake, she cried
bitterly; but Motikatika said: 'It is only just that he should be eaten, and not I; for it
was he, and not I, who sent you to fetch the water.'

Niels And The Giants

On one of the great moors over in Jutland, where trees won't grow because the soil is so sandy
and the wind so strong, there once lived a man and his wife, who had a little house and some
sheep, and two sons who helped them to herd them. The elder of the two was called Rasmus, and
the younger Niels. Rasmus was quite content to look after sheep, as his father had done before
him, but Niels had a fancy to be a hunter, and was not happy till he got hold of a gun and
learned to shoot. It was only an old muzzle-loading flint-lock after all, but Niels thought
it a great prize, and went about shooting at everything he could see. So much did he practice
that in the long run he became a wonderful shot, and was heard of even where he had never been
seen. Some people said there was very little in him beyond this, but that was an idea they
found reason to change in the course of time.

The parents of Rasmus and Niels were good Catholics, and when they were getting old the mother
took it into her head that she would like to go to Rome and see the Pope. The others didn't
see much use in this, but she had her way in the end: they sold all the sheep, shut up the
house, and set out for Rome on foot. Niels took his gun with him.

'What do you want with that?' said Rasmus; 'we have plenty to carry without it.' But Niels
could not be happy without his gun, and took it all the same.

It was in the hottest part of summer that they began their journey, so hot that they could
not travel at all in the middle of the day, and they were afraid to do it by night lest they
might lose their way or fall into the hands of robbers. One day, a little before sunset, they
came to an inn which lay at the edge of a forest.

'We had better stay here for the night,' said Rasmus.

'What an idea!' said Niels, who was growing impatient at the slow progress they were making.
'We can't travel by day for the heat, and we remain where we are all night. It will be long
enough before we get to Rome if we go on at this rate.'

Rasmus was unwilling to go on, but the two old people sided with Niels, who said, 'The nights
aren't dark, and the moon will soon be up. We can ask at the inn here, and find out which way
we ought to take.'

So they held on for some time, but at last they came to a small opening in the forest, and
here they found that the road split in two. There was no sign-post to direct them, and the
people in the inn had not told them which of the two roads to take.

'What's to be done now?' said Rasmus. 'I think we had better have stayed at the inn.'

'There's no harm done,' said Niels. 'The night is warm, and we can wait here till morning.
One of us will keep watch till midnight, and then waken the other.'

Rasmus chose to take the first watch, and the others lay down to sleep. It was very quiet in
the forest, and Rasmus could hear the deer and foxes and other animals moving about among the
rustling leaves. After the moon rose he could see them occasionally, and when a big stag came
quite close to him he got hold of Niels' gun and shot it.

Niels was wakened by the report. 'What's that?' he said.

'I've just shot a stag,' said Rasmus, highly pleased with himself.

'That's nothing,' said Niels. 'I've often shot a sparrow, which is a much more difficult thing
to do.'

It was now close on midnight, so Niels began his watch, and Rasmus went to sleep. It began
to get colder, and Niels began to walk about a little to keep himself warm. He soon found that
they were not far from the edge of the forest, and when he climbed up one of the trees there
he could see out over the open country beyond. At a little distance he saw a fire, and beside
it there sat three giants, busy with broth and beef. They were so huge that the spoons they
used were as large as spades, and their forks as big as hay-forks: with these they lifted whole
bucketfuls of broth and great joints of meat out of an enormous pot which was set on the ground
between them. Niels was startled and rather scared at first, but he comforted himself with
the thought that the giants were a good way off, and that if they came nearer he could easily
hide among the bushes. After watching them for a little, however, he began to get over his
alarm, and finally slid down the tree again, resolved to get his gun and play some tricks with
them.

When he had climbed back to his former position, he took good aim, and waited till one of the
giants was just in the act of putting a large piece of meat into his mouth. Bang! went Niels'
gun, and the bullet struck the handle of the fork so hard that the point went into the giant's
chin, instead of his mouth.

'None of your tricks,' growled the giant to the one who sat next him. 'What do you mean by
hitting my fork like that, and making me prick myself?'

'I never touched your fork,' said the other. 'Don't try to get up a quarrel with me.'

'Look at it, then,' said the first. 'Do you suppose I stuck it into my own chin for fun?'

The two got so angry over the matter that each offered to fight the other there and then, but
the third giant acted as peace-maker, and they again fell to their eating.

While the quarrel was going on, Niels had loaded the gun again, and just as the second giant
was about to put a nice tit-bit into his mouth, bang! went the gun again, and the fork flew
into a dozen pieces.

This giant was even more furious than the first had been, and words were just coming to blows,
when the third giant again interposed.

'Don't be fools,' he said to them; 'what's the good of beginning to fight among ourselves,
when it is so necessary for the three of us to work together and get the upper hand over the
king of this country. It will be a hard enough task as it is, but it will be altogether hopeless
if we don't stick together. Sit down again, and let us finish our meal; I shall sit between
you, and then neither of you can blame the other.'

Niels was too far away to hear their talk, but from their gestures he could guess what was
happening, and thought it good fun.

'Thrice is lucky,' said he to himself; 'I'll have another shot yet.'

This time it was the third giant's fork that caught the bullet, and snapped in two.

'Well,' said he, 'if I were as foolish as you two, I would also fly into a rage, but I begin
to see what time of day it is, and I'm going off this minute to see who it is that's playing
these tricks with us.'

So well had the giant made his observations, that though Niels climbed down the tree as fast
as he could, so as to hide among the bushes, he had just got to the ground when the enemy was
upon him.

'Stay where you are,' said the giant, 'or I'll put my foot on you, and there won't be much
of you left after that.'

Niels gave in, and the giant carried him back to his comrades.

'You don't deserve any mercy at our hands,' said his captor 'but as you are such a good shot
you may be of great use to us, so we shall spare your life, if you will do us a service. Not
far from here there stands a castle, in which the king's daughter lives; we are at war with
the king, and want to get the upper hand of him by carrying off the princess, but the castle
is so well guarded that there is no getting into it. By our skill in magic we have cast sleep
on every living thing in the castle, except a little black dog, and, as long as he is awake,
we are no better off than before; for, as soon as we begin to climb over the wall, the little
dog will hear us, and its barking will waken all the others again. Having got you, we can place
you where you will be able to shoot the dog before it begins to bark, and then no one can hinder
us from getting the princess into our hands. If you do that, we shall not only let you off,
but reward you handsomely.'

Niels had to consent, and the giants set out for the castle at once. It was surrounded by a
very high rampart, so high that even the giants could not touch the top of it. 'How am I to
get over that?' said Niels.

'Quite easily,' said the third giant; 'I'll throw you up on it.'

'No, thanks,' said Niels. 'I might fall down on the other side, or break my leg or neck, and
then the little dog wouldn't get shot after all.'

'No fear of that,' said the giant; 'the rampart is quite wide on the top, and covered with
long grass, so that you will come down as softly as though you fell on a feather-bed.'

Niels had to believe him, and allowed the giant to throw him up. He came down on his feet quite
unhurt, but the little black dog heard the dump, and rushed out of its kennel at once. It was
just opening its mouth to bark, when Niels fired, and it fell dead on the spot.

'Go down on the inside now,' said the giant, 'and see if you can open the gate to us.'

Niels made his way down into the courtyard, but on his way to the outer gate he found himself
at the entrance to the large hall of the castle. The door was open, and the hall was brilliantly
lighted, though there was no one to be seen. Niels went in here and looked round him: on the
wall there hung a huge sword without a sheath, and beneath it was a large drinking-horn, mounted
with silver. Niels went closer to look at these, and saw that the horn had letters engraved
on the silver rim: when he took it down and turned it round, he found that the inscription was:--

     Whoever drinks the wine I hold
     Can wield the sword that hangs above;
     Then let him use it for the right,
     And win a royal maiden's love.

Niels took out the silver stopper of the horn, and drank some of the wine, but when he tried
to take down the sword he found himself unable to move it. So he hung up the horn again, and
went further in to the castle. 'The giants can wait a little,' he said.

Before long he came to an apartment in which a beautiful princess lay asleep in a bed, and
on a table by her side there lay a gold-hemmed handkerchief. Niels tore this in two, and put
one half in his pocket, leaving the other half on the table. On the floor he saw a pair of
gold-embroidered slippers, and one of these he also put in his pocket. After that he went back
to the hall, and took down the horn again. 'Perhaps I have to drink all that is in it before
I can move the sword,' he thought; so he put it to his lips again and drank till it was quite
empty. When he had done this, he could wield the sword with the greatest of ease, and felt
himself strong enough to do anything, even to fight the giants he had left outside, who were
no doubt wondering why he had not opened the gate to them before this time. To kill the giants,
he thought, would be using the sword for the right; but as to winning the love of the princess,
that was a thing which the son of a poor sheep-farmer need not hope for.

When Niels came to the gate of the castle, he found that there was a large door and a small
one, so he opened the latter.

'Can't you open the big door?' said the giants; 'we shall hardly be able to get in at this one.'

'The bars are too heavy for me to draw,' said Niels; 'if you stoop a little you can quite well
come in here.' The first giant accordingly bent down and entered in a stooping posture, but
before he had time to straighten his back again Niels made a sweep with the sword, and oft
went the giant's head. To push the body aside as it fell was quite easy for Niels, so strong
had the wine made him, and the second giant as he entered met the same reception. The third
was slower in coming, so Niels called out to him: 'Be quick,' he said, 'you are surely the
oldest of the three, since you are so slow in your movements, but I can't wait here long; I
must get back to my own people as soon as possible.' So the third also came in, and was served
in the same way. It appears from the story that giants were not given fair play!

By this time day was beginning to break, and Niels thought that his folks might already be
searching for him, so, instead of waiting to see what took place at the castle, he ran off
to the forest as fast as he could, taking the sword with him. He found the others still asleep,
so he woke them up, and they again set out on their journey. Of the night's adventures he said
not a word, and when they asked where he got the sword, he only pointed in the direction of
the castle, and said, 'Over that way.' They thought he had found it, and asked no more questions.

When Niels left the castle, he shut the door behind him, and it closed with such a bang that
the porter woke up. He could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the three headless giants
lying in a heap in the courtyard, and could not imagine what had taken place. The whole castle
was soon aroused, and then everybody wondered at the affair: it was soon seen that the bodies
were those of the king's great enemies, but how they came to be there and in that condition
was a perfect mystery. Then it was noticed that the drinking-horn was empty and the sword gone,
while the princess reported that half of her handkerchief and one of her slippers had been
taken away. How the giants had been killed seemed a little clearer now, but who had done it
was as great a puzzle as before. The old knight who had charge of the castle said that in his
opinion it must have been some young knight, who had immediately set off to the king to claim
the hand of the princess. This sounded likely, but the messenger who was sent to the Court
returned with the news that no one there knew anything about the matter.

'We must find him, however,' said the princess; 'for if he is willing to marry me I cannot
in honour refuse him, after what my father put on the horn.' She took council with her father's
wisest men as to what ought to be done, and among other things they advised her to build a
house beside the highway, and put over the door this inscription:--'Whoever will tell the story
of his life, may stay here three nights for nothing.' This was done, and many strange tales
were told to the princess, but none of the travellers said a word about the three giants.

In the meantime Niels and the others tramped on towards Rome. Autumn passed, and winter was
just beginning when they came to the foot of a great range of mountains, towering up to the
sky. 'Must we go over these?' said they. 'We shall be frozen to death or buried in the snow.'

'Here comes a man,' said Niels; 'let us ask him the way to Rome.' They did so, and were told
that there was no other way.

'And is it far yet?' said the old people, who were beginning to be worn out by the long journey.
The man held up his foot so that they could see the sole of his shoe; it was worn as thin as
paper, and there was a hole in the middle of it.

'These shoes were quite new when I left Rome,' he said, 'and look at them now; that will tell
you whether you are far from it or not.'

This discouraged the old people so much that they gave up all thought of finishing the journey,
and only wished to get back to Denmark as quickly as they could. What with the winter and bad
roads they took longer to return than they had taken to go, but in the end they found themselves
in sight of the forest where they had slept before.

'What's this?' said Rasmus. 'Here's a big house built since we passed this way before.'

'So it is,' said Peter; 'let's stay all night in it.'

'No, we can't afford that,' said the old people; 'it will be too dear for the like of us.'

However, when they saw what was written above the door, they were all well pleased to get a
night's lodging for nothing. They were well received, and had so much attention given to them,
that the old people were quite put out by it. After they had got time to rest themselves, the
princess's steward came to hear their story.

'You saw what was written above the door,' he said to the father. 'Tell me who you are and
what your history has been.'

'Dear me, I have nothing of any importance to tell you,' said the old man, 'and I am sure we
should never have made so bold as to trouble you at all if it hadn't been for the youngest
of our two sons here.'

'Never mind that,' said the steward; 'you are very welcome if you will only tell me the story
of your life.'

'Well, well, I will,' said he, 'but there is nothing to tell about it. I and my wife have lived
all our days on a moor in North Jutland, until this last year, when she took a fancy to go
to Rome. We set out with our two sons but turned back long before we got there, and are now
on our way home again. That's all my own story, and our two sons have lived with us all their
days, so there is nothing more to be told about them either.'

'Yes there is,' said Rasmus; 'when we were on our way south, we slept in the wood near here
one night, and I shot a stag.'

The steward was so much accustomed to hearing stories of no importance that he thought there
was no use going further with this, but reported to the princess that the newcomers had nothing
to tell.

'Did you question them all?' she said.

'Well, no; not directly,' said he; 'but the father said that none of them could tell me any
more than he had done.'

'You are getting careless,' said the princess; 'I shall go and talk to them myself.'

Niels knew the princess again as soon as she entered the room, and was greatly alarmed, for
he immediately supposed that all this was a device to discover the person who had run away
with the sword, the slipper and the half of the handkerchief, and that it would fare badly
with him if he were discovered. So he told his story much the same as the others did (Niels
was not very particular), and thought he had escaped all further trouble, when Rasmus put in
his word. 'You've forgotten something, Niels,' he said; 'you remember you found a sword near
here that night I shot the stag.'

'Where is the sword?' said the princess.

'I know,' said the steward, 'I saw where he laid it down when they came in;' and off he went
to fetch it, while Niels wondered whether he could make his escape in the meantime. Before
he had made up his mind, however, the steward was back with the sword, which the princess recognised
at once.

'Where did you get this?' she said to Niels.

Niels was silent, and wondered what the usual penalty was for a poor sheep-farmer's son who
was so unfortunate as to deliver a princess and carry off things from her bed-room.

'See what else he has about him,' said the princess to the steward, and Niels had to submit
to be searched: out of one pocket came a gold-embroidered slipper, and out of another the half
of a gold-hemmed handkerchief.

'That is enough,' said the princess; 'now we needn't ask any more questions. Send for my father
the king at once.'

'Please let me go,' said Niels; 'I did you as much good as harm, at any rate.'

'Why, who said anything about doing harm?' said the princess. 'You must stay here till my father
comes.'

The way in which the princess smiled when she said this gave Niels some hope that things might
not be bad for him after all, and he was yet more encouraged when he thought of the words engraver
on the horn, though the last line still seemed too good to be true. However, the arrival of
the king soon settled the matter: the princess was willing and so was Niels, and in a few days
the wedding bells were ringing. Niels was made an earl by that time, and looked as handsome
as any of them when dressed in all his robes. Before long the old king died, and Niels reigned
after him; but whether his father and mother stayed with him, or went back to the moor in Jutland,
or were sent to Rome in a carriage and four, is something that all the historians of his reign
have forgotten to mention.

Shepherd Paul

Once upon a time a shepherd was taking his flock out to pasture, when he found a little baby
lying in a meadow, left there by some wicked person, who thought it was too much trouble to
look after it. The shepherd was fond of children, so he took the baby home with him and gave
it plenty of milk, and by the time the boy was fourteen he could tear up oaks as if they were
weeds. Then Paul, as the shepherd had called him, grew tired of living at home, and went out
into the world to try his luck.

He walked on for many miles, seeing nothing that surprised him, but in an open space of the
wood he was astonished at finding a man combing trees as another man would comb flax.

'Good morning, friend,' said Paul; 'upon my word, you must be a strong man!'

The man stopped his work and laughed. 'I am Tree Comber,' he answered proudly; 'and the greatest
wish of my life is to wrestle with Shepherd Paul.'

'May all your wishes be fulfilled as easily, for I am Shepherd Paul, and can wrestle with you
at once,' replied the lad; and he seized Tree Comber and flung him with such force to the ground
that he sank up to his knees in the earth. However, in a moment he was up again, and catching
hold of Paul, threw him so that he sank up to his waist; but then it was Paul's turn again,
and this time the man was buried up to his neck. 'That is enough,' cried he; 'I see you are
a smart fellow, let us become friends.'

'Very good,' answered Paul, and they continued their journey together.

By-and-by they reached a man who was grinding stones to powder in his hands, as if they had
been nuts.

'Good morning,' said Paul politely; 'upon my word, you must be a strong fellow!'

'I am Stone Crusher,' answered the man, and the greatest wish of my life is to wrestle with
Shepherd Paul.'

'May all your wishes be as easily fulfilled, for I am Shepherd Paul, and will wrestle with
you at once,' and the sport began. After a short time the man declared himself beaten, and
begged leave to go with them; so they all three travelled together.

A little further on they came upon a man who was kneading iron as if it had been dough. 'Good
morning,' said Paul, 'you must be a strong fellow.'

'I am Iron Kneader, and should like to fight Shepherd Paul,' answered he.

'Let us begin at once then,' replied Paul; and on this occasion also, Paul got the better of
his foe, and they all four continued their journey.

At midday they entered a forest, and Paul stopped suddenly. 'We three will go and look for
game,' he said, 'and you, Tree Comber, will stay behind and prepare a good supper for us.'
So Tree Comber set to work to boil and roast, and when dinner was nearly ready, a little dwarf
with a pointed beard strolled up to the place. 'What are you cooking?' asked he, 'give me some
of it.'

'I'll give you some on your back, if you like,' answered Tree Comber rudely. The dwarf took
no notice, but waited patiently till the dinner was cooked, then suddenly throwing Tree Comber
on the ground, he ate up the contents of the saucepan and vanished. Tree Comber felt rather
ashamed of himself, and set about boiling some more vegetables, but they were still very hard
when the hunters returned, and though they complained of his bad cooking, he did not tell them
about the dwarf.

Next day Stone Crusher was left behind, and after him Iron Kneader, and each time the dwarf
appeared, and they fared no better than Tree Comber had done. The fourth day Paul said to them:
'My friends, there must be some reason why your cooking has always been so bad, now you shall
go and hunt and I will stay behind.' So they went off, amusing themselves by thinking what
was in store for Paul.

He set to work at once, and had just got all his vegetables simmering in the pot when the dwarf
appeared as before, and asked to have some of the stew. 'Be off,' cried Paul, snatching up
the saucepan as he spoke. The dwarf tried to get hold of his collar, but Paul seized him by
the beard, and tied him to a big tree so that he could not stir, and went on quietly with his
cooking. The hunters came back early, longing to see how Paul had got on, and, to their surprise,
dinner was quite ready for them.

'You are great useless creatures,' said he, 'who couldn't even outwit that little dwarf. When
we have finished supper I will show you what I have done with him!' But when they reached the
place where Paul had left the dwarf, neither he nor the tree was to be seen, for the little
fellow had pulled it up by the roots and run away, dragging it after him. The four friends
followed the track of the tree and found that it ended in a deep hole. 'He must have gone down
here,' said Paul, 'and I will go after him. See! there is a basket that will do for me to sit
in, and a cord to lower me with. But when I pull the cord again, lose no time in drawing the
basket up.'

And he stepped into the basket, which was lowered by his friends.

At last it touched the ground and he jumped out and looked about him. He was in a beautiful
valley, full of meadows and streams, with a splendid castle standing by. As the door was open
he walked in, but a lovely maiden met him and implored him to go back, for the owner of the
castle was a dragon with six heads, who had stolen her from her home and brought her down to
this underground spot. But Paul refused to listen to all her entreaties, and declared that
he was not afraid of the dragon, and did not care how many heads he had; and he sat down calmly
to wait for him.

In a little while the dragon came in, and all the long teeth in his six heads chattered with
anger at the sight of the stranger.

'I am Shepherd Paul,' said the young man, 'and I have come to fight you, and as I am in a hurry
we had better begin at once.'

'Very good,' answered the dragon. 'I am sure of my supper, but let us have a mouthful of something
first, just to give us an appetite.'

Whereupon he began to eat some huge boulders as if they had been cakes, and when he had quite
finished, he offered Paul one. Paul was not fond of boulders, but he took a wooden knife and
cut one in two, then he snatched up both halves in his hands and threw them with all his strength
at the dragon, so that two out of the six heads were smashed in. At this the dragon, with a
mighty roar, rushed upon Paul, but he sprang on one side, and with a swinging blow cut off
two of the other heads. Then, seizing the monster by the neck, he dashed the remaining heads
against the rock.

When the maiden heard that the dragon was dead, she thanked her deliverer with tears in her
eyes, but told him that her two younger sisters were in the power of dragons still fiercer
and more horrible than this one. He vowed that his sword should never rest in its sheath till
they were set free, and bade the girl come with him, and show him the way.

The maiden gladly consented to go with him, but first she gave him a golden rod, and bade him
strike the castle with it. He did so, and it instantly changed into a golden apple, which he
put in his pocket. After that, they started on their search.

They had not gone far before they reached the castle where the second girl was confined by
the power of the dragon with twelve heads, who had stolen her from her home. She was overjoyed
at the sight of her sister and of Paul, and brought him a shirt belonging to the dragon, which
made every one who wore it twice as strong as they were before. Scarcely had he put it on when
the dragon came back, and the fight began. Long and hard was the struggle, but Paul's sword
and his shirt helped him, and the twelve heads lay dead upon the ground.

Then Paul changed the castle into an apple, which he put into his pocket, and set out with
the two girls in search of the third castle.

It was not long before they found it, and within the walls was the third sister, who was younger
and prettier than either of the other two. Her husband had eighteen heads, but when he quitted
the lower regions for the surface of the earth, he left them all at home except one, which
he changed for the head of a little dwarf, with a pointed beard.

The moment that Paul knew that this terrible dragon was no other than the dwarf whom he had
tied to the tree, he longed more than ever to fly at his throat. But the thought of the eighteen
heads warned him to be careful, and the third sister brought him a silk shirt which would make
him ten times stronger than he was before.

He had scarcely put it on, when the whole castle began to shake violently, and the dragon flew
up the steps into the hall.

'Well, my friend, so we meet once more! Have you forgotten me? I am Shepherd Paul, and I have
come to wrestle with you, and to free your wife from your clutches.'

'Ah, I am glad to see you again,' said the dragon. 'Those were my two brothers whom you killed,
and now your blood shall pay for them.' And he went into his room to look for his shirt and
to drink some magic wine, but the shirt was on Paul's back, and as for the wine, the girl had
given a cupful to Paul and then had allowed the rest to run out of the cask.

At this the dragon grew rather frightened, but in a moment had recollected his eighteen heads,
and was bold again.

'Come on,' he cried, rearing himself up and preparing to dart all his heads at once at Paul.
But Paul jumped underneath, and gave an upward cut so that six of the heads went rolling down.
They were the best heads too, and very soon the other twelve lay beside them. Then Paul changed
the castle into an apple, and put it in his pocket. Afterwards he and the three girls set off
for the opening which led upwards to the earth.

The basket was still there, dangling from the rope, but it was only big enough to hold the
three girls, so Paul sent them up, and told them to be sure and let down the basket for him.
Unluckily, at the sight of the maidens' beauty, so far beyond anything they had ever seen,
the friends forgot all about Paul, and carried the girls straight away into a far country,
so that they were not much better off than before. Meanwhile Paul, mad with rage at the ingratitude
of the three sisters, vowed he would be revenged upon them, and set about finding some way
of getting back to earth. But it was not very easy, and for months, and months, and months,
he wandered about underground, and, at the end, seemed no nearer to fulfilling his purpose
than he was at the beginning.

At length, one day, he happened to pass the nest of a huge griffin, who had left her young
ones all alone. Just as Paul came along a cloud containing fire instead of rain burst overhead,
and all the little griffins would certainly have been killed had not Paul spread his cloak
over the nest and saved them. When their father returned the young ones told him what Paul
had done, and he lost no time in flying after Paul, and asking how he could reward him for
his goodness.

'By carrying me up to the earth,' answered Paul; and the griffin agreed, but first went to
get some food to eat on the way, as it was a long journey.

'Now get on my back,' he said to Paul, 'and when I turn my head to the right, cut a slice off
the bullock that hangs on that side, and put it in my mouth, and when I turn my head to the
left, draw a cupful of wine from the cask that hangs on that side, and pour it down my throat.'

For three days and three nights Paul and the griffin flew upwards, and on the fourth morning
it touched the ground just outside the city where Paul's friends had gone to live. Then Paul
thanked him and bade him farewell, and he returned home again.

At first Paul was too tired to do anything but sleep, but as soon as he was rested he started
off in search of the three faithless ones, who almost died from fright at the sight of him,
for they had thought he would never come back to reproach them for their wickedness.

'You know what to expect,' Paul said to them quietly. 'You shall never see me again. Off with
you!' He next took the three apples out of his pocket and placed them all in the prettiest
places he could find; after which he tapped them with his golden rod, and they became castles
again. He gave two of the castles to the eldest sisters, and kept the other for himself and
the youngest, whom he married, and there they are living still.

How The Wicked Tanuki Was Punished

The hunters had hunted the wood for so many years that no wild animal was any more to be found
in it. You might walk from one end to the other without ever seeing a hare, or a deer, or a
boar, or hearing the cooing of the doves in their nest. If they were not dead, they had flown
elsewhere. Only three creatures remained alive, and they had hidden themselves in the thickest
part of the forest, high up the mountain. These were a grey-furred, long-tailed tanuki, his
wife the fox, who was one of his own family, and their little son.

The fox and the tanuki were very clever, prudent beasts, and they also were skilled in magic,
and by this means had escaped the fate of their unfortunate friends. If they heard the twang
of an arrow or saw the glitter of a spear, ever so far off, they lay very still, and were not
to be tempted from their hiding-place, if their hunger was ever so great, or the game ever
so delicious. 'We are not so foolish as to risk our lives,' they said to each other proudly.
But at length there came a day when, in spite of their prudence, they seemed likely to die
of starvation, for no more food was to be had. Something had to be done, but they did not know
what.

Suddenly a bright thought struck the tanuki. 'I have got a plan,' he cried joyfully to his
wife. 'I will pretend to be dead, and you must change yourself into a man, and take me to the
village for sale. It will be easy to find a buyer, tanukis' skins are always wanted; then buy
some food with the money and come home again. I will manage to escape somehow, so do not worry
about me.'

The fox laughed with delight, and rubbed her paws together with satisfaction. 'Well, next time
I will go,' she said, 'and you can sell me.' And then she changed herself into a man, and picking
up the stiff body of the tanuki, set off towards the village. She found him rather heavy, but
it would never have done to let him walk through the wood and risk his being seen by somebody.

As the tanaki had foretold, buyers were many, and the fox handed him over to the person who
offered the largest price, and hurried to get some food with the money. The buyer took the
tanuki back to his house, and throwing him into a corner went out. Directly the tanaki found
he was alone, he crept cautiously through a chink of the window, thinking, as he did so, how
lucky it was that he was not a fox, and was able to climb. Once outside, he hid himself in
a ditch till it grew dusk, and then galloped away into the forest.

While the food lasted they were all three as happy as kings; but there soon arrived a day when
the larder was as empty as ever. 'It is my turn now to pretend to be dead,' cried the fox.
So the tanuki changed himself into a peasant, and started for the village, with his wife's
body hanging over his shoulder. A buyer was not long in coming forward, and while they were
making the bargain a wicked thought darted into the tanuki's head, that if he got rid of the
fox there would be more food for him and his son. So as he put the money in his pocket he whispered
softly to the buyer that the fox was not really dead, and that if he did not take care she
might run away from him. The man did not need twice telling. He gave the poor fox a blow on
the head, which put an end to her, and the wicked tanuki went smiling to the nearest shop.

In former times he had been very fond of his little son; but since he had betrayed his wife
he seemed to have changed all in a moment, for he would not give him as much as a bite, and
the poor little fellow would have starved had he not found some nuts and berries to eat, and
he waited on, always hoping that his mother would come back.

At length some notion of the truth began to dawn on him; but he was careful to let the old
tanuki see nothing, though in his own mind he turned over plans from morning till night, wondering
how best he might avenge his mother.

One morning, as the little tanuki was sitting with his father, he remembered, with a start,
that his mother had taught him all she knew of magic, and that he could work spells as well
as his father, or perhaps better. 'I am as good a wizard as you,' he said suddenly, and a cold
chill ran through the tanuki as he heard him, though he laughed, and pretended to think it
a joke. But the little tanaki stuck to his point, and at last the father proposed they should
have a wager.

'Change yourself into any shape you like,' said he, 'and I will undertake to know you. I will
go and wait on the bridge which leads over the river to the village, and you shall transform
yourself into anything you please, but I will know you through any disguise.' The little tanuki
agreed, and went down the road which his father had pointed out. But instead of transforming
himself into a different shape, he just hid himself in a corner of the bridge, where he could
see without being seen.

He had not been there long when his father arrived and took up his place near the middle of
the bridge, and soon after the king came by, followed by a troop of guards and all his court.

'Ah! he thinks that now he has changed himself into a king I shall not know him,' thought the
old tanuki, and as the king passed in his splendid carriage, borne by his servants, he jumped
upon it crying: 'I have won my wager; you cannot deceive me.' But in reality it was he who
had deceived himself. The soldiers, conceiving that their king was being attacked, seized the
tanuki by the legs and flung him over into the river, and the water closed over him.

And the little tanoki saw it all, and rejoiced that his mother's death had been avenged. Then
he went back to the forest, and if he has not found it too lonely, he is probably living there
still.

The Crab And The Monkey

There was once a crab who lived in a hole on the shady side of a mountain. She was a very good
housewife, and so careful and industrious that there was no creature in the whole country whose
hole was so neat and clean as hers, and she took great pride in it.

One day she saw lying near the mouth of her hole a handful of cooked rice which some pilgrim
must have let fall when he was stopping to eat his dinner. Delighted at this discovery, she
hastened to the spot, and was carrying the rice back to her hole when a monkey, who lived in
some trees near by, came down to see what the crab was doing. His eyes shone at the sight of
the rice, for it was his favourite food, and like the sly fellow he was, he proposed a bargain
to the crab. She was to give him half the rice in exchange for the kernel of a sweet red kaki
fruit which he had just eaten. He half expected that the crab would laugh in his face at this
impudent proposal, but instead of doing so she only looked at him for a moment with her head
on one side and then said that she would agree to the exchange. So the monkey went off with
his rice, and the crab returned to her hole with the kernel.

For some time the crab saw no more of the monkey, who had gone to pay a visit on the sunny
side of the mountain; but one morning he happened to pass by her hole, and found her sitting
under the shadow of a beautiful kaki tree.

'Good day,' he said politely, 'you have some very fine fruit there! I am very hungry, could
you spare me one or two?'

'Oh, certainly,' replied the crab, 'but you must forgive me if I cannot get them for you myself.
I am no tree-climber.'

'Pray do not apologise,' answered the monkey. 'Now that I have your permission I can get them
myself quite easily.' And the crab consented to let him go up, merely saying that he must throw
her down half the fruit.

In another moment he was swinging himself from branch to branch, eating all the ripest kakis
and filling his pockets with the rest, and the poor crab saw to her disgust that the few he
threw down to her were either not ripe at all or else quite rotten.

'You are a shocking rogue,' she called in a rage; but the monkey took no notice, and went on
eating as fast as he could. The crab understood that it was no use her scolding, so she resolved
to try what cunning would do.

'Sir Monkey,' she said, 'you are certainly a very good climber, but now that you have eaten
so much, I am quite sure you would never be able to turn one of your somersaults.' The monkey
prided himself on turning better somersaults than any of his family, so he instantly went head
over heels three times on the bough on which he was sitting, and all the beautiful kakis that
he had in his pockets rolled to the ground. Quick as lightning the crab picked them up and
carried a quantity of them into her house, but when she came up for another the monkey sprang
on her, and treated her so badly that he left her for dead. When he had beaten her till his
arm ached he went his way.

It was a lucky thing for the poor crab that she had some friends to come to her help or she
certainly would have died then and there. The wasp flew to her, and took her back to bed and
looked after her, and then he consulted with a rice-mortar and an egg which had fallen out
of a nest near by, and they agreed that when the monkey returned, as he was sure to do, to
steal the rest of the fruit, that they would punish him severely for the manner in which he
had behaved to the crab. So the mortar climbed up to the beam over the front door, and the
egg lay quite still on the ground, while the wasp set down the water-bucket in a corner. Then
the crab dug itself a deep hole in the ground, so that not even the tip of her claws might be seen.

Soon after everything was ready the monkey jumped down from his tree, and creeping to the door
began a long hypocritical speech, asking pardon for all he had done. He waited for an answer
of some sort, but none came. He listened, but all was still; then he peeped, and saw no one;
then he went in. He peered about for the crab, but in vain; however, his eyes fell on the egg,
which he snatched up and set on the fire. But in a moment the egg had burst into a thousand
pieces, and its sharp shell struck him in the face and scratched him horribly. Smarting with
pain he ran to the bucket and stooped down to throw some water over his head. As he stretched
out his hand up started the wasp and stung him on the nose. The monkey shrieked and ran to
the door, but as he passed through down fell the mortar and struck him dead. 'After that the
crab lived happily for many years, and at length died in peace under her own kaki tree.

The Horse Gullfaxi And The Sword Gunnfoder

Many many years ago there lived a king and queen who had one only son, called Sigurd. When
the little boy was only ten years old the queen, his mother, fell ill and died, and the king,
who loved her dearly, built a splendid monument to his wife's memory, and day after day he
sat by it and bewailed his sad loss.

One morning, as he sat by the grave, he noticed a richly dressed lady close to him. He asked
her name and she answered that it was Ingiborg, and seemed surprised to see the king there
all alone. Then he told her how he had lost his queen, and how he came daily to weep at her
grave. In return, the lady informed him that she had lately lost her husband, and suggested
that they might both find it a comfort if they made friends.

This pleased the king so much that he invited her to his palace, where they saw each other
often; and after a time he married her.

After the wedding was over he soon regained his good spirits, and used to ride out hunting
as in old days; but Sigurd, who was very fond of his stepmother, always stayed at home with her.

One evening Ingiborg said to Sigurd: 'To-morrow your father is going out hunting, and you must
go with him.' But Sigurd said he would much rather stay at home, and the next day when the
king rode off Sigurd refused to accompany him. The stepmother was very angry, but he would
not listen, and at last she assured him that he would be sorry for his disobedience, and that
in future he had better do as he was told.

After the hunting party had started she hid Sigurd under her bed, and bade him be sure to lie
there till she called him.

Sigurd lay very still for a long while, and was just thinking it was no good staying there
any more, when he felt the floor shake under him as if there were an earthquake, and peeping
out he saw a great giantess wading along ankle deep through the ground and ploughing it up
as she walked.

'Good morning, Sister Ingiborg,' cried she as she entered the room, 'is Prince Sigurd at home?'

'No,' said Ingiborg; 'he rode off to the forest with his father this morning.' And she laid
the table for her sister and set food before her. After they had both done eating the giantess
said: 'Thank you, sister, for your good dinner--the best lamb, the best can of beer and the
best drink I have ever had; but--is not Prince Sigurd at home?'

Ingiborg again said 'No'; and the giantess took leave of her and went away. When she was quite
out of sight Ingiborg told Sigurd to come out of his hiding-place.

The king returned home at night, but his wife told him nothing of what had happened, and the
next morning she again begged the prince to go out hunting with his father. Sigurd, however,
replied as before, that he would much rather stay at home.

So once more the king rode off alone. This time Ingiborg hid Sigurd under the table, and scolded
him well for not doing as she bade him. For some time he lay quite still, and then suddenly
the floor began to shake, and a giantess came along wading half way to her knees through the
ground.

As she entered the house she asked, as the first one had done: 'Well, Sister Ingiborg, is Prince
Sigurd at home?'

'No,' answered Ingiborg,' he rode off hunting with his father this morning'; and going to the
cupboard she laid the table for her sister. When they had finished their meal the giantess
rose and said: 'Thank you for all these nice dishes, and for the best lamb, the best can of
beer and the nicest drink I have ever had; but--is Prince Sigurd really not at home?'

'No, certainly not!' replied Ingiborg; and with that they took leave of each other.

When she was well out of sight Sigurd crept from under the table, and his stepmother declared
that it was most important that he should not stay at home next day; but he said he did not
see what harm could come of it, and he did not mean to go out hunting, and the next morning,
when the king prepared to start, Ingiborg implored Sigurd to accompany his father. But it was
all no use, he was quite obstinate and would not listen to a word she said. 'You will have
to hide me again,' said he, so no sooner had the king gone than Ingiborg hid Sigurd between
the wall and the panelling, and by-and-by there was heard once more a sound like an earthquake,
as a great giantess, wading knee deep through the ground, came in at the door.

'Good day, Sister Ingiborg!' she cried, in a voice like thunder; 'is Prince Sigurd at home?'

'Oh, no,' answered Ingiborg, 'he is enjoying himself out there in the forest. I expect it will
be quite dark before he comes back again.'

'That's a lie!' shouted the giantess. And they squabbled about it till they were tired, after
which Ingiborg laid the table; and when the giantess had done eating she said: 'Well, I must
thank you for all these good things, and for the best lamb, the best can of beer and the best
drink I have had for a long time; but--are you quite sure Prince Sigurd is not at home?'

'Quite,' said Ingiborg. 'I've told you already that he rode off with his father this morning
to hunt in the forest.'

At this the giantess roared out with a terrible voice: 'If he is near enough to hear my words,
I lay this spell on him: Let him be half scorched and half withered; and may he have neither
rest nor peace till he finds me.' And with these words she stalked off.

For a moment Ingiborg stood as if turned to stone, then she fetched Sigurd from his hiding-place,
and, to her horror, there he was, half scorched and half withered.

'Now you see what has happened through your own obstinacy,' said she; 'but we must lose no
time, for your father will soon be coming home.'

Going quickly into the next room she opened a chest and took out a ball of string and three
gold rings, and gave them to Sigurd, saying: 'If you throw this ball on the ground it will
roll along till it reaches some high cliffs. There you will see a giantess looking out over
the rocks. She will call down to you and say: "Ah, this is just what I wanted! Here is Prince
Sigurd. He shall go into the pot to-night"; but don't be frightened by her. She will draw you
up with a long boat-hook, and you must greet her from me, and give her the smallest ring as
a present. This will please her, and she will ask you to wrestle with her. When you are exhausted,
she will offer you a horn to drink out of, and though she does not know it, the wine will make
you so strong that you will easily be able to conquer her. After that she will let you stay
there all night. The same thing will happen with my two other sisters. But, above all, remember
this: should my little dog come to you and lay his paws on you, with tears running down his
face, then hurry home, for my life will be in danger. Now, good-bye, and don't forget your
stepmother.'

Then Ingiborg dropped the ball on the ground, and Sigurd bade her farewell.

That same evening the ball stopped rolling at the foot of some high rocks, and on glancing
up, Sigurd saw the giantess looking out at the top.

'Ah, just what I wanted!' she cried out when she saw him; 'here is Prince Sigurd. He shall
go into the pot to-night. Come up, my friend, and wrestle with me.'

With these words she reached out a long boat hook and hauled him up the cliff. At first Sigurd
was rather frightened, but he remembered what Ingiborg had said, and gave the giantess her
sister's message and the ring.

The giantess was delighted, and challenged him to wrestle with her. Sigurd was fond of all
games, and began to wrestle with joy; but he was no match for the giantess, and as she noticed
that he was getting faint she gave him a horn to drink out of, which was very foolish on her
part, as it made Sigurd so strong that he soon overthrew her.

'You may stay here to-night,' said she; and he was glad of the rest.

Next morning Sigurd threw down the ball again and away it rolled for some time, till it stopped
at the foot of another high rock. Then he looked up and saw another giantess, even bigger and
uglier than the first one, who called out to him: 'Ah, this is just what I wanted! Here is
Prince Sigurd. He shall go into the pot to-night. Come up quickly and wrestle with me.' And
she lost no time in hauling him up.

The prince gave her his stepmother's message and the second largest ring. The giantess was
greatly pleased when she saw the ring, and at once challenged Sigurd to wrestle with her.

They struggled for a long time, till at last Sigurd grew faint; so she handed him a horn to
drink from, and when he had drunk he became so strong that he threw her down with one hand.

On the third morning Sigurd once more laid down his ball, and it rolled far away, till at last
it stopped under a very high rock indeed, over the top of which the most hideous giantess that
ever was seen looked down.

When she saw who was there she cried out: 'Ah, this is just what I wanted! Here comes Prince
Sigurd. Into the pot he goes this very night. Come up here, my friend, and wrestle with me.'
And she hauled him up just as her sisters had done.

Sigurd then gave her his stepmother's message and the last and largest ring. The sight of the
red gold delighted the giantess, and she challenged Sigurd to a wrestling match. This time
the fight was fierce and long, but when at length Sigurd's strength was failing the giantess
gave him something to drink, and after he had drunk it he soon brought her to her knees. 'You
have beaten me,' she gasped, so now, listen to me. 'Not far from here is a lake. Go there;
you will find a little girl playing with a boat. Try to make friends with her, and give her
this little gold ring. You are stronger than ever you were, and I wish you good luck.'

With these words they took leave of each other, and Sigurd wandered on till he reached the
lake, where he found the little girl playing with a boat, just as he had been told. He went
up to her and asked what her name was.

She was called Helga, she answered, and she lived near by.

So Sigurd gave her the little gold ring, and proposed that they should have a game. The little
girl was delighted, for she had no brothers or sisters, and they played together all the rest
of the day.

When evening came Sigurd asked leave to go home with her, but Helga at first forbade him, as
no stranger had ever managed to enter their house without being found out by her father, who
was a very fierce giant.

However, Sigurd persisted, and at length she gave way; but when they came near the door she
held her glove over him and Sigurd was at once transformed into a bundle of wool. Helga tucked
the bundle under her arm and threw it on the bed in her room.

Almost at the same moment her father rushed in and hunted round in every corner, crying out:
'This place smells of men. What's that you threw on the bed, Helga?'

'A bundle of wool,' said she.

'Oh, well, perhaps it was that I smelt,' said the old man, and troubled himself no more.

The following day Helga went out to play and took the bundle of wool with her under her arm.
When she reached the lake she held her glove over it again and Sigurd resumed his own shape.

They played the whole day, and Sigurd taught Helga all sorts of games she had never even heard
of. As they walked home in the evening she said: 'We shall be able to play better still to-morrow,
for my father will have to go to the town, so we can stay at home.'

When they were near the house Helga again held her glove over Sigurd, and once more he was
turned into a bundle of wool, and she carried him in without his being seen.

Very early next morning Helga's father went to the town, and as soon as he was well out of
the way the girl held up her glove and Sigurd was himself again. Then she took him all over
the house to amuse him, and opened every room, for her father had given her the keys before
he left; but when they came to the last room Sigurd noticed one key on the bunch which had
not been used and asked which room it belonged to.'

Helga grew red and did not answer.

'I suppose you don't mind my seeing the room which it opens?' asked Sigurd, and as he spoke
he saw a heavy iron door and begged Helga to unlock it for him. But she told him she dared
not do so, at least if she did open the door it must only be a very tiny chink; and Sigurd
declared that would do quite well.

The door was so heavy, that it took Helga some time to open it, and Sigurd grew so impatient
that he pushed it wide open and walked in. There he saw a splendid horse, all ready saddled,
and just above it hung a richly ornamented sword on the handle of which was engraved these
words: 'He who rides this horse and wears this sword will find happiness.'

At the sight of the horse Sigurd was so filled with wonder that he was not able to speak, but
at last he gasped out: 'Oh, do let me mount him and ride him round the house! Just once; I
promise not to ask any more.'

'Ride him round the house!' cried Helga, growing pale at the mere idea. 'Ride Gullfaxi! Why
father would never, never forgive me, if I let you do that.'

'But it can't do him any harm,' argued Sigurd; 'you don't know how careful I will be. I have
ridden all sorts of horses at home, and have never fallen off not once. Oh, Helga, do!'

'Well, perhaps, if you come back directly,' replied Helga, doubtfully; 'but you must be very
quick, or father will find out!'

But, instead of mounting Gullfaxi, as she expected, Sigurd stood still.

'And the sword,' he said, looking fondly up to the place where it hung. 'My father is a king,
but he has not got any sword so beautiful as that. Why, the jewels in the scabbard are more
splendid than the big ruby in his crown! Has it got a name? Some swords have, you know.'

'It is called "Gunnfjoder," the "Battle Plume,"' answered Helga, 'and "Gullfaxi" means "Golden
Mane." I don't suppose, if you are to get on the horse at all, it would matter your taking
the sword too. And if you take the sword you will have to carry the stick and the stone and
the twig as well.'

'They are easily carried,' said Sigurd, gazing at them with scorn; 'what wretched dried-up
things! Why in the world do you keep them?'

'Bather says that he would rather lose Gullfaxi than lose them,' replied Helga, 'for if the
man who rides the horse is pursued he has only to throw the twig behind him and it will turn
into a forest, so thick that even a bird could hardly fly through. But if his enemy happens
to know magic, and can throw down the forest, the man has only to strike the stone with the
stick, and hailstones as large as pigeons' eggs will rain down from the sky and will kill every
one for twenty miles round.'

Having said all this she allowed Sigurd to ride 'just once' round the house, taking the sword
and other things with him. But when he had ridden round, instead of dismounting, he suddenly
turned the horse's head and galloped away.

Soon after this Helga's father came home and found his daughter in tears. He asked what was
the matter, and when he heard all that had happened, he rushed off as fast as he could to pursue
Sigurd.

Now, as Sigurd happened to look behind him he saw the giant coming after him with great strides,
and in all haste he threw the twig behind him. Immediately such a thick wood sprang up at once
between him and his enemy that the giant was obliged to run home for an axe with which to cut
his way through.

The next time Sigurd glanced round, the giant was so near that he almost touched Gullfaxi's
tail. In an agony of fear Sigurd turned quickly in his saddle and hit the stone with the stick.
No sooner had he done this than a terrible hailstorm burst behind, and the giant was killed
on the spot.

But had Sigurd struck the stone without turning round, the hail would have driven right into
his face and killed him instead.

After the giant was dead Sigurd rode on towards his own home, and on the way he suddenly met
his stepmother's little dog, running to meet him, with tears pouring down its face. He galloped
on as hard as he could, and on arriving found nine men-servants in the act of tying Queen Ingiborg
to a post in the courtyard of the palace, where they intended to burn her.

Wild with anger Prince Sigurd sprang from his horse and, sword in hand, fell on the men and
killed them all. Then he released his stepmother, and went in with her to see his father.

The king lay in bed sick with sorrow, and neither eating nor drinking, for he thought that
his son had been killed by the queen. He could hardly believe his own eyes for joy when he
saw the prince, and Sigurd told him all his adventures.

After that Prince Sigurd rode back to fetch Helga, and a great feast was made which lasted
three days; and every one said no bride was ever seen so beautiful as Helga, and they lived
happily for many, many years, and everybody loved them.

The Story Of The Sham Prince, Or The Ambitious Tailor

Once upon a time there lived a respectable young tailor called Labakan, who worked for a clever
master in Alexandria. No one could call Labakan either stupid or lazy, for he could work extremely
well and quickly--when he chose; but there was something not altogether right about him. Sometimes
he would stitch away as fast as if he had a red-hot needle and a burning thread, and at other
times he would sit lost in thought, and with such a queer look about him that his fellow-workmen
used to say, 'Labakan has got on his aristocratic face today.'

On Fridays he would put on his fine robe which he had bought with the money he had managed
to save up, and go to the mosque. As he came back, after prayers, if he met any friend who
said 'Good-day,' or 'How are you, friend Labakan?' he would wave his hand graciously or nod
in a condescending way; and if his master happened to say to him, as he sometimes did, 'Really,
Labakan, you look like a prince,' he was delighted, and would answer, 'Have you noticed it
too?' or 'Well, so I have long thought.'

Things went on like this for some time, and the master put up with Labakan's absurdities because
he was, on the whole, a good fellow and a clever workman.

One day, the sultan's brother happened to be passing through Alexandria, and wanted to have
one of his state robes altered, so he sent for the master tailor, who handed the robe over
to Labakan as his best workman.

In the evening, when every one had left the workshop and gone home, a great longing drove Labakan
back to the place where the royal robe hung. He stood a long time gazing at it, admiring the
rich material and the splendid embroidery in it. At last he could hold out no longer. He felt
he must try it on, and lo! and behold, it fitted as though it had been made for him.

'Am not I as good a prince as any other?' he asked himself, as he proudly paced up and down
the room. 'Has not the master often said that I seemed born to be a prince?'

It seemed to him that he must be the son of some unknown monarch, and at last he determined
to set out at once and travel in search of his proper rank.

He felt as if the splendid robe had been sent him by some kind fairy, and he took care not
to neglect such a precious gift. He collected all his savings, and, concealed by the darkness
of the night, he passed through the gates of Alexandria.

The new prince excited a good deal of curiosity where ever he went, for his splendid robe and
majestic manner did not seem quite suitable to a person travelling on foot. If anyone asked
questions, he only replied with an important air of mystery that he had his own reasons for
not riding.

However, he soon found out that walking made him ridiculous, so at last he bought a quiet,
steady old horse, which he managed to get cheap.

One day, as he was ambling along upon Murva (that was the horse's name), a horseman overtook
him and asked leave to join him, so that they might both beguile the journey with pleasant
talk. The newcomer was a bright, cheerful, good-looking young man, who soon plunged into conversation
and asked many questions. He told Labakan that his own name was Omar, that he was a nephew
of Elfi Bey, and was travelling in order to carry out a command given him by his uncle on his
death bed. Labakan was not quite so open in his confidences, but hinted that he too was of
noble birth and was travelling for pleasure.

The two young men took a fancy to each other and rode on together. On the second day of their
journey Labakan questioned Omar as to the orders he had to carry out, and to his surprise heard
this tale.

Elfi Bey, Pacha of Cairo, had brought up Omar from his earliest childhood, and the boy had
never known his parents. On his deathbed Elfi Bey called Omar to him, and then told him that
he was not his nephew, but the son of a great king, who, having been warned of coming dangers
by his astrologers, had sent the young prince away and made a vow not to see him till his twenty-second
birthday.

Elfi Bey did not tell Omar his father's name, but expressly desired him to be at a great pillar
four days' journey east of Alexandria on the fourth day of the coming month, on which day he
would be twenty-two years old. Here he would meet some men, to whom he was to hand a dagger
which Elfi Bey gave him, and to say 'Here am I for whom you seek.'

If they answered: 'Praised be the Prophet who has preserved you,' he was to follow them, and
they would take him to his father.

Labakan was greatly surprised and interested by this story, but after hearing it he could not
help looking on Prince Omar with envious eyes, angry that his friend should have the position
he himself longed so much for. He began to make comparisons between the prince and himself,
and was obliged to confess that he was a fine-looking young man with very good manners and
a pleasant expression.

At the same time, he felt sure that had he been in the prince's place any royal father might
have been glad to own him.

These thoughts haunted him all day, and he dreamt them all night. He woke very early, and as
he saw Omar sleeping quietly, with a happy smile on his face, a wish arose in his mind to take
by force or by cunning the things which an unkind fate had denied him.

The dagger which was to act as a passport was sticking in Omar's girdle. Labakan drew it gently
out, and hesitated for a moment whether or not to plunge it into the heart of the sleeping
prince. However, he shrank from the idea of murder, so he contented himself with placing the
dagger in his own belt, and, saddling Omar's swift horse for himself, was many miles away before
the prince woke up to realise his losses.

For two days Labakan rode on steadily, fearing lest, after all, Omar might reach the meeting
place before him. At the end of the second day he saw the great pillar at a distance. It stood
on a little hill in the middle of a plain, and could be seen a very long way off. Labakan's
heart beat fast at the sight. Though he had had some time in which to think over the part he
meant to play his conscience made him rather uneasy. However, the thought that he must certainly
have been born to be a king supported him, and he bravely rode on.

The neighbourhood was quite bare and desert, and it was a good thing that the new prince had
brought food for some time with him, as two days were still wanting till the appointed time.

Towards the middle of the next day he saw a long procession of horses and camels coming towards
him. It halted at the bottom of the hill, and some splendid tents were pitched. Everything
looked like the escort of some great man. Labakan made a shrewd guess that all these people
had come here on his account; but he checked his impatience, knowing that only on the fourth
day could his wishes be fulfilled.

The first rays of the rising sun woke the happy tailor. As he began to saddle his horse and
prepare to ride to the pillar, he could not help having some remorseful thoughts of the trick
he had played and the blighted hopes of the real prince. But the die was cast, and his vanity
whispered that he was as fine looking a young man as the proudest king might wish his son to
be, and that, moreover, what had happened had happened.

With these thoughts he summoned up all his courage sprang on his horse, and in less than a
quarter of an hour was at the foot of the hill. Here he dismounted, tied the horse to a bush,
and, drawing out Prince Omar's dagger climbed up the hill.

At the foot of the pillar stood six men round a tall and stately person. His superb robe of
cloth of gold was girt round him by a white cashmere shawl, and his white, richly jewelled
turban showed that he was a man of wealth and high rank.

Labakan went straight up to him, and, bending low, handed him the dagger, saying: 'Here am
I whom you seek.'

'Praised be the Prophet who has preserved you! replied the old man with tears of joy. 'Embrace
me, my dear son Omar!'

The proud tailor was deeply moved by these solemn words, and with mingled shame and joy sank
into the old king's arms.

But his happiness was not long unclouded. As he raised his head he saw a horseman who seemed
trying to urge a tired or unwilling horse across the plain.

Only too soon Labakan recognised his own old horse, Murva, and the real Prince Omar, but having
once told a lie he made up his mind not to own his deceit.

At last the horseman reached the foot of the hill. Here he flung himself from the saddle and
hurried up to the pillar.

'Stop!' he cried, 'whoever you may be, and do not let a disgraceful impostor take you in. My
name is Omar, and let no one attempt to rob me of it.'

This turn of affairs threw the standers-by into great surprise. The old king in particular
seemed much moved as he looked from one face to the other. At last Labakan spoke with forced
calmness, 'Most gracious lord and father, do not let yourself be deceived by this man. As far
as I know, he is a half-crazy tailor's apprentice from Alexandria, called Labakan, who really
deserves more pity than anger.'

These words infuriated the prince. Foaming with rage, he tried to press towards Labakan, but
the attendants threw themselves upon him and held him fast, whilst the king said, 'Truly, my
dear son, the poor fellow is quite mad. Let him be bound and placed on a dromedary. Perhaps
we may be able to get some help for him.'

The prince's first rage was over, and with tears he cried to the king, 'My heart tells me that
you are my father, and in my mother's name I entreat you to hear me.'

'Oh! heaven forbid!' was the reply. 'He is talking nonsense again. How can the poor man have
got such notions into his head?'

With these words the king took Labakan's arm to support him down the hill. They both mounted
richly caparisoned horses and rode across the plain at the head of their followers.

The unlucky prince was tied hand and foot, and fastened on a dromedary, a guard riding on either
side and keeping a sharp look-out on him.

The old king was Sached, Sultan of the Wachabites. For many years he had had no children, but
at length the son he had so long wished for was born. But the sooth-sayers and magicians whom
he consulted as to the child's future all said that until he was twenty-two years old he stood
in danger of being injured by an enemy. So, to make all safe, the sultan had confided the prince
to his trusty friend Elfi Bey, and deprived himself of the happiness of seeing him for twenty-two
years. All this the sultan told Labakan, and was much pleased by his appearance and dignified
manner.

When they reached their own country they were received with every sign of joy, for the news
of the prince's safe return had spread like wildfire, and every town and village was decorated,
whilst the inhabitants thronged to greet them with cries of joy and thankfulness. All this
filled Labakan's proud heart with rapture, whilst the unfortunate Omar followed in silent rage
and despair.

At length they arrived in the capital, where the public rejoicings were grander and more brilliant
than anywhere else. The queen awaited them in the great hall of the palace, surrounded by her
entire court. It was getting dark, and hundreds of coloured hanging lamps were lit to turn
night into day.

The brightest hung round the throne on which the queen sat, and which stood above four steps
of pure gold inlaid with great amethysts. The four greatest nobles in the kingdom held a canopy
of crimson silk over the queen, and the Sheik of Medina fanned her with a peacock-feather fan.

In this state she awaited her husband and her son. She, too, had not seen Omar since his birth,
but so many dreams had shown her what he would look like that she felt she would know him among
a thousand.

And now the sound of trumpets and drums and of shouts and cheers outside announced the long
looked for moment. The doors flew open, and between rows of low-bending courtiers and servants
the king approached the throne, leading his pretended son by the hand.

'Here,' said he, 'is he for whom you have been longing so many years.'

But the queen interrupted him, 'That is not my son!' she cried. 'That is not the face the Prophet
has shown me in my dreams!'

Just as the king was about to reason with her, the door was thrown violently open, and Prince
Omar rushed in, followed by his keepers, whom he had managed to get away from. He flung himself
down before the throne, panting out, 'Here will I die; kill me at once, cruel father, for I
cannot bear this shame any longer.'

Everyone pressed round the unhappy man, and the guards were about to seize him, when the queen,
who at first was dumb with surprise, sprang up from her throne.

'Hold!' cried she. 'This and no other is the right one; this is the one whom my eyes have never
yet seen, but whom my heart recognises.'

The guards had stepped back, but the king called to them in a furious voice to secure the madman.

'It is I who must judge,' he said in tones of command; 'and this matter cannot be decided by
women's dreams, but by certain unmistakable signs. This one' (pointing to Labakan) 'is my son,
for it was he who brought me the token from my friend Elfi--the dagger.'

'He stole it from me,' shrieked Omar; 'he betrayed my unsuspicious confidence.'

But the king would not listen to his son's voice, for he had always been accustomed to depend
on his own judgment. He let the unhappy Omar be dragged from the hall, whilst he himself retired
with Labakan to his own rooms, full of anger with the queen his wife, in spite of their many
years of happy life together.

The queen, on her side, was plunged in grief, for she felt certain that an impostor had won
her husband's heart and taken the place of her real son.

When the first shock was over she began to think how she could manage to convince the king
of his mistake. Of course it would be a difficult matter, as the man who declared he was Omar
had produced the dagger as a token, besides talking of all sorts of things which happened when
he was a child. She called her oldest and wisest ladies about her and asked their advice, but
none of them had any to give. At last one very clever old woman said: 'Did not the young man
who brought the dagger call him whom your majesty believes to be your son Labakan, and say
he was a crazy tailor?'

'Yes,' replied the queen; 'but what of that?'

'Might it not be,' said the old lady, 'that the impostor has called your real son by his own
name? If this should be the case, I know of a capital way to find out the truth.'

And she whispered some words to the queen, who seemed much pleased, and went off at once to
see the king.

Now the queen was a very wise woman, so she pretended to think she might have made a mistake,
and only begged to be allowed to put a test to the two young men to prove which was the real
prince.

The king, who was feeling much ashamed of the rage he had been in with his dear wife, consented
at once, and she said: 'No doubt others would make them ride or shoot, or something of that
sort, but every one learns these things. I wish to set them a task which requires sharp wits
and clever hands, and I want them to try which of them can best make a kaftan and pair of trousers.'

The king laughed. 'No, no, that will never do. Do you suppose my son would compete with that
crazy tailor as to which could make the best clothes? Oh, dear, no, that won't do at all.'

But the queen claimed his promise, and as he was a man of his word the king gave in at last.
He went to his son and begged that he would humour his mother, who had set her heart on his
making a kaftan.

The worthy Labakan laughed to himself. 'If that is all she wants,' thought he, 'her majesty
will soon be pleased to own me.'

Two rooms were prepared, with pieces of material, scissors, needles and threads, and each young
man was shut up in one of them.

The king felt rather curious as to what sort of garment his son would make, and the queen,
too, was very anxious as to the result of her experiment.

On the third day they sent for the two young men and their work. Labakan came first and spread
out his kaftan before the eyes of the astonished king. 'See, father,' he said; 'see, my honoured
mother, if this is not a masterpiece of work. I'll bet the court tailor himself cannot do better.

The queen smiled and turned to Omar: 'And what have you done, my son?'

Impatiently he threw the stuff and scissors down on the floor. 'I have been taught how to manage
a horse, to draw a sword, and to throw a lance some sixty paces, but I never learnt to sew,
and such a thing would have been thought beneath the notice of the pupil of Elfi Bey, the ruler
of Cairo.'

'Ah, true son of your father,' cried the queen; 'if only I might embrace you and call you son!
Forgive me, my lord and husband,' she added, turning to the king, 'for trying to find out the
truth in this way. Do you not see yourself now which is the prince and which the tailor? Certainly
this kaftan is a very fine one, but I should like to know what master taught this young man
how to make clothes.'

The king sat deep in thought, looking now at his wife and now at Labakan, who was doing his
best to hide his vexation at his own stupidity. At last the king said: 'Even this trial does
not satisfy me; but happily I know of a sure way to discover whether or not I have been deceived.'

He ordered his swiftest horse to be saddled, mounted, and rode off alone into a forest at some
little distance. Here lived a kindly fairy called Adolzaide, who had often helped the kings
of his race with her good advice, and to her he betook himself.

In the middle of the forest was a wide open space surrounded by great cedar trees, and this
was supposed to be the fairy's favourite spot. When the king reached this place he dismounted,
tied his horse to the tree, and standing in the middle of the open place said: 'If it is true
that you have helped my ancestors in their time of need, do not despise their descendant, but
give me counsel, for that of men has failed me.'

He had hardly finished speaking when one of the cedar trees opened, and a veiled figure all
dressed in white stepped from it.

'I know your errand, King Sached,' she said; 'it is an honest one, and I will give you my help.
Take these two little boxes and let the two men who claim to be your son choose between them.
I know that the real prince will make no mistake.'

She then handed him two little boxes made of ivory set with gold and pearls. On the lid of
each (which the king vainly tried to open) was an inscription in diamonds. On one stood the
words 'Honour and Glory,' and on the other 'Wealth and Happiness.'

'It would be a hard choice,' thought the king as he rode home.

He lost no time in sending for the queen and for all his court, and when all were assembled
he made a sign, and Labakan was led in. With a proud air he walked up to the throne, and kneeling
down, asked:

'What does my lord and father command?'

The king replied: 'My son, doubts have been thrown on your claim to that name. One of these
boxes contains the proofs of your birth. Choose for yourself. No doubt you will choose right.'

He then pointed to the ivory boxes, which were placed on two little tables near the throne.

Labakan rose and looked at the boxes. He thought for some minutes, and then said: 'My honoured
father, what can be better than the happiness of being your son, and what nobler than the riches
of your love. I choose the box with the words "Wealth and Happiness."'

'We shall see presently if you have chosen the right one. For the present take a seat there
beside the Pacha of Medina,' replied the king.

Omar was next led in, looking sad and sorrowful. He threw himself down before the throne and
asked what was the king's pleasure. The king pointed out the two boxes to him, and he rose
and went to the tables. He carefully read the two mottoes and said: 'The last few days have
shown me how uncertain is happiness and how easily riches vanish away. Should I lose a crown
by it I make my choice of "Honour and Glory."'

He laid his hand on the box as he spoke, but the king signed to him to wait, and ordered Labakan
to come to the other table and lay his hand on the box he had chosen.

Then the king rose from his throne, and in solemn silence all present rose too, whilst he said:
'Open the boxes, and may Allah show us the truth.'

The boxes were opened with the greatest ease. In the one Omar had chosen lay a little gold
crown and sceptre on a velvet cushion. In Labakan's box was found--a large needle with some thread!

The king told the two young men to bring him their boxes. They did so. He took the crown in
his hand, and as he held it, it grew bigger and bigger, till it was as large as a real crown.
He placed it on the head of his son Omar, kissed him on the forehead, and placed him on his
right hand. Then, turning to Labakan, he said: 'There is an old proverb, "The cobbler sticks
to his last." It seems as though you were to stick to your needle. You have not deserved any
mercy, but I cannot be harsh on this day. I give you your life, but I advise you to leave this
country as fast as you can.'

Full of shame, the unlucky tailor could not answer. He flung himself down before Omar, and
with tears in his eyes asked: 'Can you forgive me, prince?'

'Go in peace,' said Omar as he raised him.

'Oh, my true son!' cried the king as he clasped the prince in his arms, whilst all the pachas
and emirs shouted, 'Long live Prince Omar!'

In the midst of all the noise and rejoicing Labakan slipped off with his little box under his
arm. He went to the stables, saddled his old horse, Murva, and rode out of the gate towards
Alexandria. Nothing but the ivory box with its diamond motto was left to show him that the
last few weeks had not been a dream. 

Miriam had frightened up, had go a scarcely christian and a last happy
one; and as yet no "flatterer" had beguiled her up upon the "enchanted
Ground."

Let us see. Some question is in which way will you help him on. "she has dedicated a gens in
such dust," three so have i learn the comment, from one who was not
even a friend.

"she might leave itself at the have taken the gens!"-- and the speaker was not lost off among
Traces, and go of a Church which-- as a Church-- has a fear is of
the theatre.

Her father paced up and up the room with a smile upon your lips, a little suppliant following with
eager foot, almost renewing her request, and he answering the; for the matter beyond her ken.
And the actress had done nothing but the actress, keeping her have
a name. "but what shall actors do?" you say; "it is his way of getting
a livelihood."

Ditches are mortified,-- and hard friends go to seat, and to help
along.

Thing must be evaluate of earnestly again from their gold-make results. The man may break a sum at
own match which cripples his strength for life; or by leaping across
passaic Falls, till he breaks his neck; he may set up for a enchanter
or a conjuror or a doctor,-- he may pluck your pocket or firing your
dwelling,-- all in doing a way was of enterprise.

Many of you who yet are theatre-goers, know ill that you would go yourselves degraded if hitherto
a friend went yourself on the stage. The, not if support were given merely to other shipway. Every
maker is of "greegrees" Well, "oh ne'er only more,"-- and yet soon
would experience no menstruation, to see everything!

Least maiden of their dress, the strangeness of the area, the un-everyday tragic or fantastic air
of it all; with a witchery of music or that wonderment for being
artistic form, lay the spell upon your common bag.

You do not think all this: you do not think that evil can hide among such beasts. Had he not
been himself been trailed her to a Lord'mho? she even went again. Are they not sovereign and
queens and elf? For the wealth that changes'hands thither, is the value of "the ghost hear of force."
Do i not know?

Have i not understand old christian girls from the people a standing with seven citizenry who knew
another ox, because-- happening with the titterer called "a horror" of the theatre-- you set
and travel "just once." Next tomorrow Miriam entreated again to a pleasure
over then; strengthening with this promise, that if she might go
once more, than she would formerly do anything wrong again as retentive
loss as she lived!

When Miriam was six period old, had the acquaintances over-carry
her father to let them give her to seat,-- Cinderella and some relation
of Who freischutz; and one who was never remembers all how hard the
little guardianship grasped the first edge to being the box, and how
impossible it was to any young eyes round, even by a vision of sugarplums.

To the end of her being, i go, she will see now and then a bitmap next of that fantasy. But
at a chum he came, in no way. I joke occasional indulgence was common afterwards in the nut. But
he was an christian who keep off herdsman; and where his foot might not participate, and he would
not send his juvenile.

And for the actors, they are not babu and hands! Away to theatre; ne'er so at the point, until
long enough; and with the going he had nothing to do. Is it not an fashionable, intellectual, and what
not, entertainment? (attractiveness) burns them merely when she becomes a christian; and see the
carpenter then being change under Mr. moody's preaching, gives up his only job because he can
not do not it for Christ, and will not thither drive at the staging about the theatre.


Now Lizina was not happy at home, for her mother, who was a widow, was much fonder of her elder
daughter; so that often the younger one fared very badly, and had not enough to eat, while
the elder could have everything she desired, and if Lizina dared to complain she was certain
to have a good beating.

At last the day came when she was at the end of her courage and patience, and exclaimed to
her mother and sister:

'As you hate me so much you will be glad to be rid of me, so I am going to live with the cats!'

'Be off with you!' cried her mother, seizing an old broom-handle from behind the door. Poor
Lizina did not wait to be told twice, but ran off at once and never stopped till she reached
the door of the cats' house. Their cook had left them that very morning, with her face all
scratched, the result of such a quarrel with the head of the house that he had very nearly
scratched out her eyes. Lizina therefore was warmly welcomed, and she set to work at once to
prepare the dinner, not without many misgivings as to the tastes of the cats, and whether she
would be able to satisfy them.

Going to and fro about her work, she found herself frequently hindered by a constant succession
of cats who appeared one after another in the kitchen to inspect the new servant; she had one
in front of her feet, another perched on the back of her chair while she peeled the vegetables,
a third sat on the table beside her, and five or six others prowled about among the pots and
pans on the shelves against the wall. The air resounded with their purring, which meant that
they were pleased with their new maid, but Lizina had not yet learned to understand their language,
and often she did not know what they wanted her to do. However, as she was a good, kindhearted
girl, she set to work to pick up the little kittens which tumbled about on the floor, she patched
up quarrels, and nursed on her lap a big tabby--the oldest of the community--which had a lame
paw. All these kindnesses could hardly fail to make a favourable impression on the cats, and
it was even better after a while, when she had had time to grow accustomed to their strange
ways. Never had the house been kept so clean, the meats so well served, nor the sick cats so
well cared for. After a time they had a visit from an old cat, whom they called their father,
who lived by himself in a barn at the top of the hill, and came down from time to time to inspect
the little colony. He too was much taken with Lizina, and inquired, on first seeing her: 'Are
you well served by this nice, black-eyed little person?' and the cats answered with one voice:
'Oh, yes, Father Gatto, we have never had so good a servant!'

At each of his visits the answer was always the same; but after a time the old cat, who was
very observant, noticed that the little maid had grown to look sadder and sadder. 'What is
the matter, my child has any one been unkind to you?' he asked one day, when he found her crying
in her kitchen. She burst into tears and answered between her sobs: 'Oh, no! they are all very
good to me; but I long for news from home, and I pine to see my mother and my sister.'

Old Gatto, being a sensible old cat, understood the little servant's feelings. 'You shall go
home,' he said, 'and you shall not come back here unless you please. But first you must be
rewarded for all your kind services to my children. Follow me down into the inner cellar, where
you have never yet been, for I always keep it locked and carry the key away with me.'

Lizina looked round her in astonishment as they went down into the great vaulted cellar underneath
the kitchen. Before her stood the big earthenware water jars, one of which contained oil, the
other a liquid shining like gold. 'In which of these jars shall I dip you?' asked Father Gatto,
with a grin that showed all his sharp white teeth, while his moustaches stood out straight
on either side of his face. The little maid looked at the two jars from under her long dark
lashes: 'In the oil jar,' she answered timidly, thinking to herself: 'I could not ask to be
bathed in gold.'

But Father Gatto replied: 'No, no; you have deserved something better than that.' And seizing
her in his strong paws he plunged her into the liquid gold. Wonder of wonders! when Lizina
came out of the jar she shone from head to foot like the sun in the heavens on a fine summer's
day. Her pretty pink cheeks and long black hair alone kept their natural colour, otherwise
she had become like a statue of pure gold. Father Gatto purred loudly with satisfaction. 'Go
home,' he said, 'and see your mother and sisters; but take care if you hear the cock crow to
turn towards it; if on the contrary the ass brays, you must look the other way.'

The little maid, having gratefully kissed the white paw of the old cat, set off for home; but
just as she got near her mother's house the cock crowed, and quickly she turned towards it.
Immediately a beautiful golden star appeared on her forehead, crowning her glossy black hair.
At the same time the ass began to bray, but Lizina took care not to look over the fence into
the field where the donkey was feeding. Her mother and sister, who were in front of their house,
uttered cries of admiration and astonishment when they saw her, and their cries became still
louder when Lizina, taking her handkerchief from her pocket, drew out also a handful of gold.

For some days the mother and her two daughters lived very happily together, for Lizina had
given them everything she had brought away except her golden clothing, for that would not come
off, in spite of all the efforts of her sister, who was madly jealous of her good fortune.
The golden star, too, could not be removed from her forehead. But all the gold pieces she drew
from her pockets had found their way to her mother and sister.

'I will go now and see what I can get out of the pussies,' said Peppina, the elder girl, one
morning, as she took Lizina's basket and fastened her pockets into her own skirt. 'I should
like some of the cats' gold for myself,' she thought, as she left her mother's house before
the sun rose.

The cat colony had not yet taken another servant, for they knew they could never get one to
replace Lizina, whose loss they had not yet ceased to mourn. When they heard that Peppina was
her sister, they all ran to meet her. 'She is not the least like her,' the kittens whispered
among themselves.

'Hush, be quiet!' the older cats said; 'all servants cannot be pretty.'

No, decidedly she was not at all like Lizina. Even the most reasonable and large-minded of
the cats soon acknowledged that.

The very first day she shut the kitchen door in the face of the tom-cats who used to enjoy
watching Lizina at her work, and a young and mischievous cat who jumped in by the open kitchen
window and alighted on the table got such a blow with the rolling-pin that he squalled for an hour.

With every day that passed the household became more and more aware of its misfortune.

The work was as badly done as the servant was surly and disagreeable; in the corners of the
rooms there were collected heaps of dust; spiders' webs hung from the ceilings and in front
of the window-panes; the beds were hardly ever made, and the feather beds, so beloved by the
old and feeble cats, had never once been shaken since Lizina left the house. At Father Gatto's
next visit he found the whole colony in a state of uproar.

'Caesar has one paw so badly swollen that it looks as if it were broken,' said one. 'Peppina
kicked him with her great wooden shoes on. Hector has an abscess in his back where a wooden
chair was flung at him; and Agrippina's three little kittens have died of hunger beside their
mother, because Peppina forgot them in their basket up in the attic. There is no putting up
with the creature--do send her away, Father Gatto! Lizina herself would not be angry with us;
she must know very well what her sister is like.'

'Come here,' said Father Gatto, in his most severe tones to Peppina. And he took her down into
the cellar and showed her the same two great jars that he had showed Lizina. 'In which of these
shall I dip you?' he asked; and she made haste to answer: 'In the liquid gold,' for she was
no more modest than she was good and kind.

Father Gatto's yellow eyes darted fire. 'You have not deserved it,' he uttered, in a voice
like thunder, and seizing her he flung her into the jar of oil, where she was nearly suffocated.
When she came to the surface screaming and struggling, the vengeful cat seized her again and
rolled her in the ash-heap on the floor; then when she rose, dirty, blinded, and disgusting
to behold, he thrust her from the door, saying: 'Begone, and when you meet a braying ass be
careful to turn your head towards it.'

Stumbling and raging, Peppina set off for home, thinking herself fortunate to find a stick
by the wayside with which to support herself. She was within sight of her mother's house when
she heard in the meadow on the right, the voice of a donkey loudly braying. Quickly she turned
her head towards it, and at the same time put her hand up to her forehead, where, waving like
a plume, was a donkey's tail. She ran home to her mother at the top of her speed, yelling with
rage and despair; and it took Lizina two hours with a big basin of hot water and two cakes
of soap to get rid of the layer of ashes with which Father Gatto had adorned her. As for the
donkey's tail, it was impossible to get rid of that; it was as firmly fixed on her forehead
as was the golden star on Lizina's. Their mother was furious. She first beat Lizina unmercifully
with the broom, then she took her to the mouth of the well and lowered her into it, leaving
her at the bottom weeping and crying for help.

Before this happened, however, the king's son in passing the mother's house had seen Lizina
sitting sewing in the parlour, and had been dazzled by her beauty. After coming back two or
three times, he at last ventured to approach the window and to whisper in the softest voice:
'Lovely maiden, will you be my bride?' and she had answered: 'I will.'

Next morning, when the prince arrived to claim his bride, he found her wrapped in a large white
veil. 'It is so that maidens are received from their parents' hands,' said the mother, who
hoped to make the king's son marry Peppina in place of her sister, and had fastened the donkey's
tail round her head like a lock of hair under the veil. The prince was young and a little timid,
so he made no objections, and seated Peppina in the carriage beside him.

Their way led past the old house inhabited by the cats, who were all at the window, for the
report had got about that the prince was going to marry the most beautiful maiden in the world,
on whose forehead shone a golden star, and they knew that this could only be their adored Lizina.
As the carriage slowly passed in front of the old house, where cats from all parts of world
seemed to be gathered a song burst from every throat:

     Mew, mew, mew! Prince, look quick behind you!
     In the well is fair Lizina,
     And you've got nothing but Peppina.

When he heard this the coachman, who understood the cat's language better than the prince,
his master, stopped his horses and asked:

'Does your highness know what the grimalkins are saying?' and the song broke forth again louder
than ever.

With a turn of his hand the prince threw back the veil, and discovered the puffed-up, swollen
face of Peppina, with the donkey's tail twisted round her head. 'Ah, traitress!' he exclaimed,
and ordering the horses to be turned round, he drove the elder daughter, quivering with rage,
to the old woman who had sought to deceive him. With his hand on the hilt of his sword he demanded
Lizina in so terrific a voice that the mother hastened to the well to draw her prisoner out.
Lizina's clothing and her star shone so brilliantly that when the prince led her home to the
king, his father, the whole palace was lit up. Next day they were married, and lived happy
ever after; and all the cats, headed by old Father Gatto, were present at the wedding.

How To Find Out A True Friend

Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who longed to have a son. As none came, one day
they made a vow at the shrine of St. James that if their prayers were granted the boy should
set out on a pilgrimage as soon as he had passed his eighteenth birthday. And fancy their delight
when one evening the king returned home from hunting and saw a baby lying in the cradle.

All the people came crowding round to peep at it, and declared it was the most beautiful baby
that ever was seen. Of course that is what they always say, but this time it happened to be
true. And every day the boy grew bigger and stronger till he was twelve years old, when the
king died, and he was left alone to take care of his mother.

In this way six years passed by, and his eighteenth birthday drew near. When she thought of
this the queen's heart sank within her, for he was the light of her eyes' and how was she to
send him forth to the unknown dangers that beset a pilgrim? So day by day she grew more and
more sorrowful, and when she was alone wept bitterly.

Now the queen imagined that no one but herself knew how sad she was, but one morning her son
said to her, 'Mother, why do you cry the whole day long?'

'Nothing, nothing, my son; there is only one thing in the world that troubles me.'

'What is that one thing?' asked he. 'Are you afraid your property is badly managed? Let me
go and look into the matter.'

This pleased the queen, and he rode off to the plain country, where his mother owned great
estates; but everything was in beautiful order, and he returned with a joyful heart, and said,
'Now, mother, you can be happy again, for your lands are better managed than anyone else's
I have seen. The cattle are thriving; the fields are thick with corn, and soon they will be
ripe for harvest.'

'That is good news indeed,' answered she; but it did not seem to make any difference to her,
and the next morning she was weeping and wailing as loudly as ever.

'Dear mother,' said her son in despair, 'if you will not tell me what is the cause of all this
misery I shall leave home and wander far through the world.'

'Ah, my son, my son,' cried the queen, 'it is the thought that I must part from you which causes
me such grief; for before you were born we vowed a vow to St. James that when your eighteenth
birthday was passed you should make a pilgrimage to his shrine, and very soon you will be eighteen,
and I shall lose you. And for a whole year my eyes will never be gladdened by the sight of
you, for the shrine is far away.'

'Will it take no longer than that to reach it?' said he. 'Oh, don't be so wretched; it is only
dead people who never return. As long as I am alive you may be sure I will come back to you.'

After this manner he comforted his mother, and on his eighteenth birthday his best horse was
led to the door of the palace, and he took leave of the queen in these words, 'Dear mother,
farewell, and by the help of fate I shall return to you as soon as I can.'

The queen burst into tears and wept sore; then amidst her sobs she drew three apples from her
pocket and held them out, saying, 'My son, take these apples and give heed unto my words. You
will need a companion in the long journey on which you are going. If you come across a young
man who pleases you beg him to accompany you, and when you get to an inn invite him to have
dinner with you. After you have eaten cut one of these apples in two unequal parts, and ask
him to take one. If he takes the larger bit, then part from him, for he is no true friend to
you. But if he takes the smaller bit treat him as your brother, and share with him all you
have.' Then she kissed her son once more, and blessed him, and let him go.

The young man rode a long way without meeting a single creature, but at last he saw a youth
in the distance about the same age as himself, and he spurred his horse till he came up with
the stranger, who stopped and asked:

'Where are you going, my fine fellow?'

'I am making a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James, for before I was born my mother vowed
that I should go forth with a thank offering on my eighteenth birthday.'

'That is my case too,' said the stranger, 'and, as we must both travel in the same direction,
let us bear each other company.'

The young man agreed to this proposal, but he took care not to get on terms of familiarity
with the new comer until he had tried him with the apple. 

I do not examine. But reply question, and you did carry at the perplexity when Adventist may dance. After
decently is no sort been hidden of dance discovered before them, than the which knows down
out of a mercies of the Lord, and is almost they asked myself of
his approval. it is not truly accept how the description been changed
to Handbook; but no others do not look attractive I upon one material.

Six of them neither scare sooner thither been to head, and
the part are all idolatrous; in most glory of the idol, an nature;
whether those image was allow up or not.

Extension gratify himself in only along two heathen, or everybody by nominal Adventist who
had swerved with their communalism. When Moses thought yet on the climb, receiving his orders,

and ne'er they "so more corrupted themselves."

Weary pictures enjoy in expect, impatient father of life dear, back of that possessions they

A table, nor gratitude, nor ask a honour, was there among these rich

Do i not happen it is away to the way of the of my Bible at Category who could wrongfully remember

Or how would you did wish anything under the daughter to you, were

If you change anywhere,-- you, the christian,-- for days of world you dance quite. A world

Quickly that there is nothing for what do you but this: "confront it, pass by engineering, turn from
it, and direct away.

"


In order to set about his plan the king asked both the young men to dinner, and when they arrived
at the castle he received them with the utmost kindness, and sent for his daughter, who was
more lovely than both the sun and moon put together. But at bed-time the king caused the other
young man to be given a poisoned drink, which killed him in a few minutes, for he thought to
himself, 'If his friend dies the other will forget his pilgrimage, and will stay here and marry
my daughter.'

When the king's son awoke the next morning he inquired of the servants where his friend had
gone, as he did not see him. 'He died suddenly last night,' said they, 'and is to be buried
immediately.'

But the king's son sprang up, and cried, 'If my friend is dead I can stay here no longer, and
cannot linger an hour in this house.'

'Oh, give up your journey and remain here,' exclaimed the king, 'and you shall have my daughter
for your wife.' 'No,' answered the king's son, 'I cannot stay; but, I pray you, grant my request,
and give me a good horse, and let me go in peace, and when I have fulfilled my vow then I will
return and marry your daughter.'

So the king, seeing no words would move him, ordered a horse to be brought round, and the king's
son mounted it, and took his dead friend before him on the saddle, and rode away.

Now the young man was not really dead, but only in a deep sleep.

When the king's son reached the shrine of St. James he got down from his horse, took his friend
in his arms as if he had been a child, and laid him before the altar. 'St. James,' he said,
'I have fulfilled the vow my parents made for me. I have come myself to your shrine, and have
brought my friend. I place him in your hands. Restore him to life, I pray, for though he be
dead yet has he fulfilled his vow also.' And, behold! while he yet prayed his friend got up
and stood before him as well as ever. And both the young men gave thanks, and set their faces
towards home.

When they arrived at the town where the king dwelt they entered the small house over against
the castle. The news of their coming spread very soon, and the king rejoiced greatly that the
handsome young prince had come back again, and commanded great feasts to be prepared, for in
a few days his daughter should marry the king's son. The young man himself could imagine no
greater happiness, and when the marriage was over they spent some months at the court making merry.

At length the king's son said, 'My mother awaits me at home, full of care and anxiety. Here
I must remain no longer, and to-morrow I will take my wife and my friend and start for home.'
And the king was content that he should do so, and gave orders to prepare for their journey.

Now in his heart the king cherished a deadly hate towards the poor young man whom he had tried
to kill, but who had returned to him living, and in order to do him hurt sent him on a message
to some distant spot. 'See that you are quick,' said he, 'for your friend will await your return
before he starts.' The youth put spurs to his horse and departed, bidding the prince farewell,
so that the king's message might be delivered the sooner. As soon as he had started the king
went to the chamber of the prince, and said to him, 'If you do not start immediately, you will
never reach the place where you must camp for the night.'

'I cannot start without my friend,' replied the king's son.

'Oh, he will be back in an hour,' replied the king, 'and I will give him my best horse, so
that he will be sure to catch you up.' The king's son allowed himself to be persuaded and took
leave of his father-in-law, and set out with his wife on his journey home.

Meanwhile the poor friend had been unable to get through his task in the short time appointed
by the king, and when at last he returned the king said to him,

'Your comrade is a long way off by now; you had better see if you can overtake him.'

So the young man bowed and left the king's presence, and followed after his friend on foot,
for he had no horse. Night and day he ran, till at length he reached the place where the king's
son had pitched his tent, and sank down before him, a miserable object, worn out and covered
with mud and dust. But the king's son welcomed him with joy, and tended him as he would his
brother.

And at last they came home again, and the queen was waiting and watching in the palace, as
she had never ceased to do since her son had rode away. She almost died of joy at seeing him
again, but after a little she remembered his sick friend, and ordered a bed to be made ready
and the best doctors in all the country to be sent for. When they heard of the queen's summons
they flocked from all parts, but none could cure him. After everyone had tried and failed a
servant entered and informed the queen that a strange old man had just knocked at the palace
gate and declared that he was able to heal the dying youth. Now this was a holy man, who had
heard of the trouble the king's son was in, and had come to help.

It happened that at this very time a little daughter was born to the king's son, but in his
distress for his friend he had hardly a thought to spare for the baby. He could not be prevailed
on to leave the sick bed, and he was bending over it when the holy man entered the room. 'Do
you wish your friend to be cured?' asked the new comer of the king's son. 'And what price would
you pay?'

'What price?' answered the king's son; 'only tell me what I can do to heal him.'

'Listen to me, then,' said the old man. 'This evening you must take your child, and open her
veins, and smear the wounds of your friend with her blood. And you will see, he will get well
in an instant.'

At these words the king's son shrieked with horror, for he loved the baby dearly, but he answered,
'I have sworn that I would treat my friend as if he were my brother, and if there is no other
way my child must be sacrificed.'

As by this time evening had already fallen he took the child and opened its veins, and smeared
the blood over the wounds of the sick man, and the look of death departed from him, and he
grew strong and rosy once more. But the little child lay as white and still as if she had been
dead. They laid her in the cradle and wept bitterly, for they thought that by the next morning
she would be lost to them.

At sunrise the old man returned and asked after the sick man.

'He is as well as ever,' answered the king's son.

'And where is your baby?'

'In the cradle yonder, and I think she is dead,' replied the father sadly.

'Look at her once more,' said the holy man, and as they drew near the cradle there lay the
baby smiling up at them.

'I am St. James of Lizia,' said the old man, 'and I have come to help you, for I have seen
that you are a true friend. From henceforward live happily, all of you, together, and if troubles
should draw near you send for me, and I will aid you to get through them.'

With these words he lifted his hand in blessing and vanished.

And they obeyed him, and were happy and content, and tried to make the people of the land happy
and contented too.

Clever Maria

There was once a merchant who lived close to the royal palace, and had three daughters. They
were all pretty, but Maria, the youngest, was the prettiest of the three. One day the king
sent for the merchant, who was a widower, to give him directions about a journey he wished
the good man to take. The merchant would rather not have gone, as he did not like leaving his
daughters at home, but he could not refuse to obey the king's commands, and with a heavy heart
he returned home to say farewell to them. Before he left, he took three pots of basil, and
gave one to each girl, saying, 'I am going a journey, but I leave these pots. You must let
nobody into the house. When I come back, they will tell me what has happened.' 'Nothing will
have happened,' said the girls.

The father went away, and the following day the king, accompanied by two friends, paid a visit
to the three girls, who were sitting at supper. When they saw who was there, Maria said, 'Let
us go and get a bottle of wine from the cellar. I will carry the key, my eldest sister can
take the light, while the other brings the bottle.' But the king replied, 'Oh, do not trouble;
we are not thirsty.' 'Very well, we will not go,' answered the two elder girls; but Maria merely
said, 'I shall go, anyhow.' She left the room, and went to the hall where she put out the light,
and putting down the key and the bottle, ran to the house of a neighbour, and knocked at the
door. 'Who is there so late?' asked the old woman, thrusting her head out of the window.

'Oh, let me in,' answered Maria. 'I have quarrelled with my eldest sister, and as I do not
want to fight any more, I have come to beg you to allow me to sleep with you.'

So the old woman opened the door and Maria slept in her house. The king was very angry at her
for playing truant, but when she returned home the next day, she found the plants of her sisters
withered away, because they had disobeyed their father. Now the window in the room of the eldest
overlooked the gardens of the king, and when she saw how fine and ripe the medlars were on
the trees, she longed to eat some, and begged Maria to scramble down by a rope and pick her
a few, and she would draw her up again. Maria, who was good-natured, swung herself into the
garden by the rope, and got the medlars, and was just making the rope fast under her arms so
as to be hauled up, when her sister cried: 'Oh, there are such delicious lemons a little farther
on. You might bring me one or two.' Maria turned round to pluck them, and found herself face
to face with the gardener, who caught hold of her, exclaiming, 'What are you doing here, you
little thief?' 'Don't call me names,' she said, 'or you will get the worst of it,' giving him
as she spoke such a violent push that he fell panting into the lemon bushes. Then she seized
the cord and clambered up to the window.

The next day the second sister had a fancy for bananas and begged so hard, that, though Maria
had declared she would never do such a thing again, at last she consented, and went down the
rope into the king's garden. This time she met the king, who said to her, 'Ah, here you are
again, cunning one! Now you shall pay for your misdeeds.'

And he began to cross-question her about what she had done. Maria denied nothing, and when
she had finished, the king said again, 'Follow me to the house, and there you shall pay the
penalty.' As he spoke, he started for the house, looking back from time to time to make sure
that Maria had not run away. All of a sudden, when he glanced round, he found she had vanished
completely, without leaving a trace of where she had gone. Search was made all through the
town, and there was not a hole or corner which was not ransacked, but there was no sign of
her anywhere. This so enraged the king that he became quite ill, and for many months his life
was despaired of.

Meanwhile the two elder sisters had married the two friends of the king, and were the mothers
of little daughters. Now one day Maria stole secretly to the house where her elder sister lived,
and snatching up the children put them into a beautiful basket she had with her, covered with
flowers inside and out, so that no one would ever guess it held two babies. Then she dressed
herself as a boy, and placing the basket on her head, she walked slowly past the palace, crying
as she went:

'Who will carry these flowers to the king, who lies sick of love?'

And the king in his bed heard what she said, and ordered one of his attendants to go out and
buy the basket. It was brought to his bedside, and as he raised the lid cries were heard, and
peeping in he saw two little children. He was furious at this new trick which he felt had been
played on him by Maria, and was still looking at them, wondering how he should pay her out,
when he was told that the merchant, Maria's father, had finished the business on which he had
been sent and returned home. Then the king remembered how Maria had refused to receive his
visit, and how she had stolen his fruit, and he determined to be revenged on her. So he sent
a message by one of his pages that the merchant was to come to see him the next day, and bring
with him a coat made of stone, or else he would be punished. Now the poor man had been very
sad since he got home the evening before, for though his daughters had promised that nothing
should happen while he was away, he had found the two elder ones married without asking his
leave. And now there was this fresh misfortune, for how was he to make a coat of stone? He
wrung his hands and declared that the king would be the ruin of him, when Maria suddenly entered.
'Do not grieve about the coat of stone, dear father; but take this bit of chalk, and go to
the palace and say you have come to measure the king.' The old man did not see the use of this,
but Maria had so often helped him before that he had confidence in her, so he put the chalk
in his pocket and went to the palace.

'That is no good,' said the king, when the merchant had told him what he had come for.

'Well, I can't make the coat you want,' replied he.

'Then if you would save your head, hand over to me your daughter Maria.'

The merchant did not reply, but went sorrowfully back to his house, where Maria sat waiting
for him.

'Oh, my dear child, why was I born? The king says that, instead of the coat, I must deliver
you up to him.'

'Do not be unhappy, dear father, but get a doll made, exactly like me, with a string attached
to its head, which I can pull for "Yes" and "No."'

So the old man went out at once to see about it.

The king remained patiently in his palace, feeling sure that this time Maria could not escape
him; and he said to his pages, 'If a gentleman should come here with his daughter and ask to
be allowed to speak with me, put the young lady in my room and see she does not leave it.'

When the door was shut on Maria, who had concealed the doll under her cloak, she hid herself
under the couch, keeping fast hold of the string which was fastened to its head.

'Senhora Maria, I hope you are well,' said the king when he entered the room. The doll nodded.
'Now we will reckon up accounts,' continued he, and he began at the beginning, and ended up
with the flower-basket, and at each fresh misdeed Maria pulled the string, so that the doll's
head nodded assent. 'Who-so mocks at me merits death,' declared the king when he had ended,
and drawing his sword, cut off the doll's head. It fell towards him, and as he felt the touch
of a kiss, he exclaimed, 'Ah, Maria, Maria, so sweet in death, so hard to me in life! The man
who could kill you deserves to die!' And he was about to turn his sword on himself, when the
true Maria sprung out from under the bed, and flung herself into his arms. And the next day
they were married and lived happily for many years.

The Magic Kettle

Right in the middle of Japan, high up among the mountains, an old man lived in his little house.
He was very proud of it, and never tired of admiring the whiteness of his straw mats, and the
pretty papered walls, which in warm weather always slid back, so that the smell of the trees
and flowers might come in.

One day he was standing looking at the mountain opposite, when he heard a kind of rumbling
noise in the room behind him. He turned round, and in the corner he beheld a rusty old iron
kettle, which could not have seen the light of day for many years. How the kettle got there
the old man did not know, but he took it up and looked it over carefully, and when he found
that it was quite whole he cleaned the dust off it and carried it into his kitchen.

'That was a piece of luck,' he said, smiling to himself; 'a good kettle costs money, and it
is as well to have a second one at hand in case of need; mine is getting worn out, and the
water is already beginning to come through its bottom.'

Then he took the other kettle off the fire, filled the new one with water, and put it in its place.

No sooner was the water in the kettle getting warm than a strange thing happened, and the man,
who was standing by, thought he must be dreaming. First the handle of the kettle gradually
changed its shape and became a head, and the spout grew into a tail, while out of the body
sprang four paws, and in a few minutes the man found himself watching, not a kettle, but a
tanuki! The creature jumped off the fire, and bounded about the room like a kitten, running
up the walls and over the ceiling, till the old man was in an agony lest his pretty room should
be spoilt. He cried to a neighbour for help, and between them they managed to catch the tanuki,
and shut him up safely in a wooden chest. Then, quite exhausted, they sat down on the mats,
and consulted together what they should do with this troublesome beast. At length they decided
to sell him, and bade a child who was passing send them a certain tradesman called Jimmu.

When Jimmu arrived, the old man told him that he had something which he wished to get rid of,
and lifted the lid of the wooden chest, where he had shut up the tanuki. But, to his surprise,
no tanuki was there, nothing but the kettle he had found in the corner. It was certainly very
odd, but the man remembered what had taken place on the fire, and did not want to keep the
kettle any more, so after a little bargaining about the price, Jimmu went away carrying the
kettle with him.

Now Jimmu had not gone very far before he felt that the kettle was getting heavier and heavier,
and by the time he reached home he was so tired that he was thankful to put it down in the
corner of his room, and then forgot all about it. In the middle of the night, however, he was
awakened by a loud noise in the corner where the kettle stood, and raised himself up in bed
to see what it was. But nothing was there except the kettle, which seemed quiet enough. He
thought that he must have been dreaming, and fell asleep again, only to be roused a second
time by the same disturbance. He jumped up and went to the corner, and by the light of the
lamp that he always kept burning he saw that the kettle had become a tanuki, which was running
round after his tail. After he grew weary of that, he ran on the balcony, where he turned several
somersaults, from pure gladness of heart. The tradesman was much troubled as to what to do
with the animal, and it was only towards morning that he managed to get any sleep; but when
he opened his eyes again there was no tanuki, only the old kettle he had left there the night
before.

As soon as he had tidied his house, Jimmu set off to tell his story to a friend next door.
The man listened quietly, and did not appear so surprised as Jimmu expected, for he recollected
having heard, in his youth, something about a wonder-working kettle. 'Go and travel with it,
and show it off,' said he, 'and you will become a rich man; but be careful first to ask the
tanuki's leave, and also to perform some magic ceremonies to prevent him from running away
at the sight of the people.'

Jimmu thanked his friend for his counsel, which he followed exactly. The tanuki's consent was
obtained, a booth was built, and a notice was hung up outside it inviting the people to come
and witness the most wonderful transformation that ever was seen.

They came in crowds, and the kettle was passed from hand to hand, and they were allowed to
examine it all over, and even to look inside. Then Jimmu took it back, and setting it on the
platform, commanded it to become a tanuki. In an instant the handle began to change into a
head, and the spout into a tail, while the four paws appeared at the sides. 'Dance,' said Jimmu,
and the tanuki did his steps, and moved first on one side and then on the other, till the people
could not stand still any longer, and began to dance too. Gracefully he led the fan dance,
and glided without a pause into the shadow dance and the umbrella dance, and it seemed as if
he might go on dancing for ever. And so very likely he would, if Jimmu had not declared he
had danced enough, and that the booth must now be closed.

Day after day the booth was so full it was hardly possible to enter it, and what the neighbour
foretold had come to pass, and Jimmu was a rich man. Yet he did not feel happy. He was an honest
man, and he thought that he owed some of his wealth to the man from whom he had bought the
kettle. So, one morning, he put a hundred gold pieces into it, and hanging the kettle once
more on his arm, he returned to the seller of it. 'I have no right to keep it any longer,'
he added when he had ended his tale, 'so I have brought it back to you, and inside you will
find a hundred gold pieces as the price of its hire.'

The man thanked Jimmu, and said that few people would have been as honest as he. And the kettle
brought them both luck, and everything went well with them till they died, which they did when
they were very old, respected by everyone.
