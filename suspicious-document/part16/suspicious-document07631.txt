Be this as it may, the case is narrowed down to this. Of all the subjects naturally under the
church’s supervision, there is not one in which her influence is less than in this. She neither
represses nor regulates. One of two courses she must pursue if she would escape the stigma
of impotency. Either she must reassert her old dogmas, and back them by the severest discipline,
or she must modify them, and openly commit herself to a larger liberty. Is she prepared for
the first of these courses? Is she prepared, first of all, to defend it from God’s Word. Undercut

I would not have the church compromise one hair’s-breadth with sin. Better that she should
err in excessive stringency. But I would have her gain a new vantage ground by being simply
true, and not proclaiming unmixed evil, where evil and good are blended in liberal proportions.
By not undertaking the task of extermination, where her duty is that of discrimination. The
moment she begins upon the principle of analyzing these mixed elements, casting only the bad
away, and using, developing and enjoying the good, that moment she mounts to a point from which
she can regulate any matter which falls under her jurisdiction. And to be thus true, she must
go direct to Christ. His word and example are conclusive, and we may safely preach what we
find there. Do we find any such principle of repression as the church has preached for years
past? No; we find abuse condemned, and use allowed and approved. The Savior is at the hilarious
merry-making of the marriage, contributing to the festivity. His own parable is on record,
bidding men put the gospel into all the forms and developments of life, to refine and fit them
for human enjoyment. Whether task is prominent paths, a extent to which it may hold the effects

 I cannot avoid quoting just here the exquisite words
of Trench on the Marriage at Cana, as bringing out clearly our Savior’s example on this point:
“We need not wonder to find the Lord of life at that festival; for he came to sanctify all
life, its times of joy, as its times of sorrow; and all experience tells us that it is times
of gladness, such as this was now, which especially need  such a sanctifying power, such a
presence of the Lord. In times of sorrow the sense of God’s presence comes most naturally out;
in these it is in danger to be forgotten. He was there, and by his presence struck the key-note
to the whole future tenor of his ministry. He should not be as another Baptist, to withdraw
himself from the common paths of men, a preacher in the wilderness; but his should be at once
a harder and a higher task, to mingle with and purify the common life of men, to witness for
and bring out the glory which was hidden in its every relation.” To the same purpose are the
pertinent words of Alford: “To endeavor to evade the work which he has appointed for each man,
by refusing the bounty to save the trouble of seeking the grace, is an attempt which must ever
end in degradation of the individual motives and in social demoralization, whatever present
apparent effects may follow its first promulgation.”
