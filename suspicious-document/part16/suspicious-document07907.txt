All God's help, all God's comfortings are to be had by us by Grace. This Grace will constantly
be withdrawn so that we may learn that we arrive at nothing by our own power but by gift of
God, who is ever willing to give to us provided we whole-heartedly respond. This Response to
God is surely amongst the most difficult of our achievements; unaided by Grace it is an impossibility,
but we know that every man born into the world is invited by Christ to ask for and to receive
this Grace. The effect of Response to God is a unity of our tiny force to the Might-Presence
and company of God as much as we are able to bear it, producing in us while with us such wealth
of living; and such happiness as passes all description. As we have capacity to respond to
God so we shall know that of God which is not known by those as yet unlearned in response.
For God, we know, is neither This nor That, but so infinitely more than any particularisation
that we are able to know Him only and solely according to our own capacity to receive Him.
To one He is a Personal Power that ravishes with might, whose awful magnetism draws the very
heart and soul in longing anguish from the body. To another He is the dimly known silent Manipulator
of the Universe, the secret Ruler to whose mighty Will creation bows--because needs must. To
another He is yet even more remote, being the unresponsive, impersonal, incomprehensible, immovable
Instigator of all law.

What is it in our religion that we need for a full happiness? Not the God of our mere faith,
nor the God of the theologian veiled behind great mysteries of book-learning. It is the Responsive
God that we long for, and how shall we reach Him? There is one way only--through the taking
of Jesus Christ firmly and faithfully into our own heart and life.

It is not what we now are, or where we now stand that matters, but what He has the power to
bring us to.

How is God-consciousness to be achieved--shall we do it by study, by reading? No--for the study
or reading of it will do no more than whet the appetite for spiritual things--this is its work,--but
can do no more in giving us the actual possession of this joy than the study of a menu can
satisfy hunger.

Individual, personal and inward possession is in all things our necessity. If our friend has
slept well it is no rest to us if we have slept ill. Up to a given point in all things each
for himself. It is the law. Of where this law ends or is superseded by the law of all for all
only the Holy Spirit can instruct us, and that inwardly and again each to himself. It has its name

 Ten years, twenty,
thirty--what are such in comparison with the blisses that shall afterwards be ours for all
eternity?

To look up by day or night into the vastness of the sky with its endless depths, and as we
do it burn with the consciousness of God, this is to truly live. No distance is too great,
no space too wide. All is our home. Without this burning consciousness of God, Space is a thing
of fear and Eternity not to be thought of.

Of the many experiences and conditions of the soul returning to God there is a condition all
too easily entered--that of an enervating, pulseless, seductive inertia. In this condition
of inert but marvellous contentment the soul would love to stay. This is spiritual sensuality,
a spiritual back-water. The true life and energy of the soul are lulled to idleness: basking
in happiness, the soul ceases to give and becomes merely receptive.

This condition is entered from many levels: we can rise to it (for it is very high) from ordinary
levels, branch sideways to it from high contemplation; drop to it from the greatest contacts
with God. This condition seems strangely familiar to the soul. So much so that she questions
herself. Was it from this I started on my wanderings from God? The true health of the soul
when in the blisses of God is to be in a state of intense living or activity. She is then in
perfect connection with the Divine Energy. She is then in a state of an immense and boundless
radiantly joyful Life.

To find God is to have the scope of all our senses increased, but it is easily to be understood
that our power of suffering increases also, because we are, as it were, flayed and laid bare
to everything alike. But it increases our joys to so great a degree that for the first time
in life joy is greater than pain, happiness is greater than sorrow, knowledge is greater than
fear, and Good suddenly becomes to us so much greater than Evil that Evil becomes negligible.
This increase, this wonderful addition to our former condition, might be partly conveyed by
comparison to a man who from birth has never been able to appreciate music: for him it has
been meaningless, a noise without suggestion, without delight, without wings, and suddenly
by no powers of his own the immense charms and pleasures and capacities of it are laid open
to him! These increases of every sense and faculty God will give to His lovers, so that without
effort and by what has now become to us our own nature we are continually able to enter the
Sublime.

Of the Two Wills

We have in us two wills. The Will to live, and the Will to love God and to find Him. The first
will we see being used continually and without ceasing, not only by every man, woman, and child,
but by every beast of the field and the whole of creation.

The Will to live is the will by which all alike seek the best for themselves, here gaining
for themselves all that they can of comfort and well-being out of the circumstances and opportunities
of life. This is our natural Will. But it is not the will which gains for us Eternal Life,
nor does it even gain for us peace and happiness during this life. It is this Will to live
which in Christ's Process we are taught to break and bruise till it finally dies, and the Will
to love, and gladly and joyously to please God is the only Will by which we live.

Our great difficulty is that we try at one and the same time to hang to God with the soul and
to the world with our heart. What is required is not that we go and live in rags in a desert
place, but that in the exact circumstances of life in which we find ourselves we learn in everything
to place God first. He requires of us a certain subtle and inward fidelity--a fidelity of the
heart, the will, the mind. The natural state of heart and mind in which we all normally find
ourselves is to have temporary vague longings for something which, though indefinable, we yet
know to be better and more satisfying than anything we can find in the world. This is the soul,
trying to overrule the frivolity of the heart and mind and to re-find God. Our difficulties
are not made of great things, but of the infinitely small our own caprices. Though we can often
do great things, acts of surprising heroism, we are held in chains--at once elastic and iron--of
small capricious vanities, so that in one and the same hour we may have wonderful, far-reaching
aspirations towards the Sublime, and God; and yet there comes a pretty frock, a pleasant companion,
and behold God is forgotten! The mighty and marvellous Maker of the Universe, Lord of everything,
is placed upon one side for a piece of chiffon, a flattering word from a passing lover.

So be it. He uses no force. We are still in the Garden of Free-Will. And when the Garden closes
down for us, what then? Will chiffon help us? Will the smiles of a long-since faithless lover
be our strength? Now is the time to decide; but our decision is made in the world, and by means
of the world and not apart from it, and in the exact circumstances in which we find ourselves.

Another difficulty we have, and which forms an insuperable barrier to finding God, is the ever-recurring--we
may almost say the continual--secret undercurrent of criticism and hardness towards God over
what we imagine to be His Will. We need to seek God with that which is most like Him, with
a will which most nearly resembles His own. To be in a state of hardness or criticism, not
only for God but for any creature, in even the smallest degree is to be giving allegiance to,
and unifying ourselves with, that Will which is opposite to, furthest away from, and opposed
to God. He Himself is Ineffable Tenderness.

Having once re-found God, the soul frequently cries to Him in an anguish of pained wonder,
"How could I ever have left Thee? How could I ever have been faithless to Thine Unutterable
Perfections?" This to the soul remains the mystery of mysteries. Was it because of some imperfection
left in her of design by God in order that He might enjoy His power to bring her back to Him?
If this were so, then every single soul must be redeemed--and not for love's sake, but for
His Honour, His own Holy Name, His Perfection. If the soul left Him because of a deliberate
choice, a preference for imperfection, a poisonous curiosity of foreign loves, then love alone
is the cause and necessity of our redemption, and so it feels to be, for in experience we find
that love is the beginning and the middle and the end of all His dealings with us.
