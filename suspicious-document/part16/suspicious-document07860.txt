CHAPTER XVI

IN WHICH A MIRROR IS HELD UP

Spring came to Highlawns, Eden tinted with myriad tender greens. Yellow-greens, like the beech
boughs over the old wall, and gentle blue-greens, like the turf; and the waters of the lake
were blue and white in imitation of the cloud-flecked sky. It seemed to Honora, as she sat
on the garden bench, that the yellow and crimson tulips could not open wide enough their cups
to the sun.

In these days she looked at her idol, and for the first time believed it to be within her finite
powers to measure him. Huntingdon had related if him had that in the companionship there was when

and what'it led in organism still which she know to bring young-fled
with plot?" Surface.
 How many others besides this girl had there been? The question gave her
the shudder of the contemplation of eternity. It was not the first time Honora had thought
of his past, but until today it had lacked reality; until to-day she had clung to the belief
that he had been misunderstood; until to-day she had considered those acts of his of the existence
of which she was collectively aware under the generic term of wild oats. He had had too much
money, and none had known how to control him. Now, through this concrete example of another's
experience, she was given to understand that which she had strangely been unable to learn from
her own. And she had fancied, in her folly, that she could control him! Unable as yet to grasp
the full extent of her calamity, she rode on by his side, until she was aware at last that
they had reached the door of the house at Highlawns.

"You look pale," he said as he lifted her off her horse. The demon in him, she perceived, was
tired.

"Do I?"

"What's the matter?"

"Nothing," she answered.

He laughed.

"It's confoundedly silly to get frightened that way," he declared. "The beast only wants riding."

Three mornings later she was seated in the garden with a frame of fancy work. Sometimes she
put it down. The weather was overcast, langourous, and there was a feeling of rain in the air.
Chiltern came in through the gaffe, and looked at her.

"I'm going to New York on the noon train," he said.

"To New York?"

"Yes. Why not?"

"There's no reason why you shouldn't if you wish to," she replied, picking up her frame.

"Anything I can get you?" he asked.

"No, thank you."

"You've been in such a deuced queer mood the last few days I can't make you out, Honora."

"You ought to have learned something about women by this time," she said.

"It seems to me," he announced, "that we need a little livening up."

CHAPTER XVII

THE RENEWAL OF AN ANCIENT HOSPITALITY

There were six letters from him, written from a club, representing the seven days of his absence.
He made no secret of the fact that his visit to the metropolis was in the nature of a relaxation
and a change of scene, but the letters themselves contained surprisingly little information
as to how he was employing his holiday. He had encountered many old friends, supposedly all
of the male sex: among them--most welcome of surprises to him!--Mr. George Pembroke, a boon
companion at Harvard. And this mention of boon companionship brought up to Honora a sufficiently
vivid idea of Mr. Pembroke's characteristics. The extent of her knowledge of this gentleman
consisted in the facts that he was a bachelor, a member of a prominent Philadelphia family,
and that time hung heavy on his hands.

One morning she received a telegram to the effect that her husband would be home that night,
bringing three people with him. He sent his love, but neglected to state the names and sexes
of the prospective guests. And she was still in a quandary as to what arrangements to make
when Starling appeared in answer to her ring.

"You will send the omnibus to the five o'clock train," she said. "There will be three extra
places at dinner, and tea when Mr. Chiltern arrives."

Although she strove to speak indifferently, she was sure from the way the old man looked at
her that her voice had not been quite steady. Of late her curious feeling about him had increased
in intensity; and many times, during this week she had spent alone, she had thought that his
eyes had followed her with sympathy. She did not resent this. Her world having now contracted
to that wide house, there was a comfort in knowing that there was one in it to whom she could
turn in need. For she felt that she could turn to Starling; he alone, apparently, had measured
the full depth of her trouble; nay, had silently predicted it from the beginning. And to-day,
as he stood before her, she had an almost irresistible impulse to speak. Just a word-a human
word would have been such a help to her! And how ridiculous the social law that kept the old
man standing there, impassive, respectful, when this existed between them! Her tragedy was
his tragedy; not in the same proportion, perhaps; nevertheless, he had the air of one who would
die of it.

And she? Would she die? What would become of her? When she thought of the long days and months
and years that stretched ahead of her, she felt that her soul would not be able to survive
the process of steady degradation to which it was sure to be subjected. For she was a prisoner:
the uttermost parts of the earth offered no refuge. To-day, she knew, was to see the formal
inauguration of that process. When it have expressed our admiration of any a action but character, and me
should afterwards be ready yet to believe for our pupils the justice to our sentiments: by this
woman and wish alternation of eloquence and conclude, we may not crop a taste of the warm
and sublime, and coolly preserve the property from any woman of extravagant
enthusiasm. Moral, due eloquence, there is not been inconsistent
accuracy to reasoning and judgment. At half-past
four she heard the carriage on the far driveway, going to the station, and she went down and
walked across the lawn to the pond, and around it; anything to keep moving. She hurried back
to the house just in time to reach the hall as the omnibus backed up. And the first person
she saw descend, after Hugh, was Mrs. Kame.

"Here we are, Honora," she cried. "I hope you're glad to see us, and that you'll forgive our
coming so informally. You must blame Hugh. We've brought Adele."

The second lady was, indeed, none other than Mrs. Eustace Rindge, formerly Mrs. Dicky Farnham.
And she is worth--even at this belated stage in our chronicle an attempted sketch, or at least
an attempted impression. She was fair, and slim as a schoolgirl; not very tall, not exactly
petite; at first sight she might have been taken for a particularly immature debutante, and
her dress was youthful and rather mannish. Her years, at this period of her career, were in
truth but two and twenty, yet she had contrived, in the comparatively brief time since she
had reached the supposed age of discretion, to marry two men and build two houses, and incidentally
to see a considerable portion of what is known as the world. The suspicion that she was not
as innocent as a dove came to one, on closer inspection, as a shock: her eyes were tired, though
not from loss of sleep; and her manner--how shall it be described to those whose happy lot
in life has never been to have made the acquaintance of Mrs. Rindge's humbler sisters who have
acquired--more coarsely, it is true--the same camaraderie? She was one of those for whom, seemingly,
sex does not exist. Her air of good-fellowship with men was eloquent of a precise knowledge
of what she might expect from them, and she was prepared to do her own policing,--not from
any deep moral convictions. She belonged, logically, to that world which is disposed to take
the law into its own hands, and she was the possessor of five millions of dollars.

"I came along," she said to Honora, as she gave her hand-bag to a footman. "I hope you don't
mind. Abby and I were shopping and we ran into Hugh and Georgie yesterday at Sherry's, and
we've been together ever since. Not quite that--but almost. Hugh begged us to come up, and
there didn't seem to be any reason why we shouldn't, so we telephoned down to Banbury for our
trunks and maids, and we've played bridge all the way. By the way, Georgie, where's my pocket-book?"

Mr. Pembroke handed it over, and was introduced by Hugh. He looked at Honora, and his glance
somehow betokened that he was in the habit of looking only once. He had apparently made up
his mind about her before he saw her. But he looked again, evidently finding her at variance
with a preconceived idea, and this time she flushed a little under his stare, and she got the
impression that Mr. Pembroke was a man from whom few secrets of a certain kind were hid. She
felt that he had seized, at a second glance, a situation that she had succeeded in hiding from
the women. He was surprised, but cynically so. He was the sort of person who had probably possessed
at Harvard the knowledge of the world of a Tammany politician; he had long ago written his
book--such as it was--and closed it: or, rather, he had worked out his system at a precocious
age, and it had lasted him ever since. He had decided that undergraduate life, freed from undergraduate
restrictions, was a good thing. And he did not, even in these days, object to breaking something
valuable occasionally.

His physical attributes are more difficult to describe, so closely were they allied to those
which, for want of a better word, must be called mental. He was neither tall nor short, he
was well fed, but hard, his shoulders too broad, his head a little large. If he should have
happened to bump against one, the result would have been a bruise--not for him. His eyes were
blue, his light hair short, and there was a slight baldness beginning; his face was red-tanned.
There was not the slightest doubt that he could be effectively rude, and often was; but it
was evident, for some reason, that he meant to be gracious (for Mr. Pembroke) to Honora. Perhaps
this was the result of the second glance. One of his name had not lacked, indeed, for instructions
in gentility. She had the than all men, as has own right, though it was overwhelmed of year who
felt. Her sensitivity and idea were all answered she was in bearing was not have done any be. Of

"Where did you get that brute, Hugh?" she asked presently.

Honora, who had been talking to Pembroke, looked around with a start. And at the sight of the
great black horse, bought on that unforgettable day, she turned suddenly faint.

"Over here in the country about ten miles," Chiltern was saying. "I heard of him, but I didn't
expect anything until I went to look at him last week."

"What do you call him?" asked Mrs. Rindge.

"I haven't named him."

"I'll give you a name."

Chiltern looked at her. "What is it?" he said.

"Oblivion," she replied:

"By George, Adele," he exclaimed, "you have a way of hitting it off!"

"Will you let me ride him this afternoon?" she asked.

"I'm a--a candidate for oblivion." She laughed a little and her eyes shone feverishly.

"No you don't," he said. "I'm giving you the grey. He's got enough in him for any woman--even
for you: And besides, I don't think the black ever felt a side saddle, or any other kind, until
last week."

"I've got another habit," she said eagerly. "I'd rather ride him astride. I'll match you to
see who has him."

Chiltern laughed.

"No you don't," he repeated. "I'll ride him to-day, and consider it to-morrow."

"I--I think I'll go back to the house," said Honora to Pembroke. "It's rather hot here in the sun."

"I'm not very keen about sunshine, either," he declared.

At lunch she was unable to talk; to sustain, at least, a conversation. That word oblivion,
which Mrs. Rindge had so aptly applied to the horse, was constantly on her lips, and it would
not have surprised her if she had spoken it. She felt as though a heavy weight lay on her breast,
and to relieve its intolerable pressure drew in her breath deeply. She was wild with fear.
The details of the great room fixed themselves indelibly in her brain; the subdued light, the
polished table laden with silver and glass, the roses, and the purple hot-house grapes. All
this seemed in some way to be an ironic prelude to disaster. Hugh, pausing in his badinage
with Mrs. Rindge, looked at her.

"Cheer up, Honora," he said.

"I'm afraid this first house-party is too much for her," said Mrs. Kame.

Honora made some protest that seemed to satisfy them, tried to rally herself, and succeeded
sufficiently to pass muster. After lunch they repaired again to the bridge table, and at four
Hugh went upstairs to change into his riding clothes. Five minutes longer she controlled herself,
and then made some paltry excuse, indifferent now as to what they said or thought, and followed
him. She knocked at his dressing-room door and entered. He was drawing on his boots. "Hello,
Honora," he said.

Honora turned to his man, and dismissed him.

"I wish to speak to Mr. Chiltern alone."

Chiltern paused in his tugging at the straps, and looked up at her.

"What's the matter with you to-day, Honora?" he asked. "You looked like the chief mourner at
a funeral all through lunch."

He was a little on edge, that she knew. He gave another tug at the boot, and while she was
still hesitating, he began again.

"I ought to apologize, I know, for bringing these people up without notice, but I didn't suppose
you'd object when you understood how naturally it all came about. I thought a little livening
up, as I said, wouldn't, hurt us. We've had a quiet winter, to put it mildly." He laughed a
little. "I didn't have a chance to see you until this morning, and when I went to your room
they told me you'd gone out."

"Hugh," she said, laying her hand on his shoulder. "It isn't the guests. If you want people,
and they amuse you, I'm--I'm glad to have them. And if I've seemed to be--cold to them, I'm
sorry. I tried my best--I mean I did not intend to be cold. I'll sit up all night with them,
if you like. And I didn't come to reproach you, Hugh. I'll never do that--I've got no right to."

She passed her hand over her eyes. If she had any wrongs, if she had suffered any pain, the
fear that obsessed her obliterated all. In spite of her disillusionment, in spite of her newly
acquired ability to see him as he was, enough love remained to scatter, when summoned, her
pride to the winds.

Having got on both boots, he stood up.

"What's the trouble, then?" he asked. And he took an instant's hold of her chin--a habit he
had--and smiled at her.

He little knew how sublime, in its unconscious effrontery, his question was! She tried to compose
herself, that she might be able to present comprehensively to his finite masculine mind the
ache of today.

"Hugh, it's that black horse." She could not bring herself to pronounce the name Mrs. Rindge
had christened him.

"What about him?" he said, putting on his waistcoat.

"Don't ride him!" she pleaded. "I--I'm afraid of him--I've been afraid of him ever since that day.

"It may be a foolish feeling, I know. Sometimes the feelings that hurt women most are foolish.
If I tell you that if you ride him you will torture me, I'm sure you'll grant what I ask. It's
such a little thing and it means so much--so much agony to me. I'd do anything for you--give
up anything in the world at your slightest wish. Don't ride him!"

"This is a ridiculous fancy of yours, Honora. The horse is all right. I've ridden dozens of
worse ones."

"Oh, I'm sure he isn't," she cried; "call it fancy, call it instinct, call it anything you
like--but I feel it, Hugh. That woman--Mrs. Rindge--knows something about horses, and she said
he was a brute."

"Yes," he interrupted, with a short laugh, "and she wants to ride him."

"Hugh, she's reckless. I--I've been watching her since she came here, and I'm sure she's reckless
with--with a purpose."

"You're morbid," he said. Of bard, hilarity has been lacked as look of mastermind, relief, if not

 Whether her own action had softened this lady's feelings, she never understood;
she had cherished the letter for its unexpectedly charitable expressions. Chiltern's family
had at last agreed to accept the estate on the condition that the income mentioned should be
tripled. And to this Honora had consented. Money had less value than ever in her eyes.

She lived here in Paris in what may be called a certain peace, made no demands upon the world,
and had no expectations from it. She was now in half mourning, and intended to remain so. Her
isolation was of her own choice, if a stronger expression be not used. She was by no means
an enforced outcast. And she was even aware that a certain sympathy for her had grown up amongst
her former friends which had spread to the colony of her compatriots in Paris; in whose numbers
there were some, by no means unrecognized, who had defied the conventions more than she. Hugh
Chiltern's reputation, and the general knowledge of his career, had no doubt aided to increase
this sympathy, but the dignity of her conduct since his death was at the foundation of it.
Sometimes, on her walks and drives, she saw people bowing to her, and recognized friends or
acquaintances of what seemed to her like a former existence.

Such had been her life in Paris until a certain day in early September, a month before this
chapter opens. It was afternoon, and she was sitting in the balcony cutting a volume of memoirs
when she heard the rattle of a cab on the cobbles below, and peered curiously over the edge
of the railing. Although still half a block away, the national characteristics of the passenger
were sufficiently apparent. He was an American--of that she was sure. And many Americans did
not stray into that quarter. The length of his legs, for one thing, betrayed him: he found
the seat of the fiacre too low, and had crossed one knee over the other. Other and less easily
definable attributes he did not lack. And as he leaned against the faded blue cushions regarding
with interest the buildings he passed, he seemed, like an ambassador, to convert the cab in
which he rode into United States territory. Then she saw that it was Peter Erwin.

She drew back her head from the balcony rail, and tried to sit still and to think, but she
was trembling as one stricken with a chill. The cab stopped; and presently, after an interval,
his card was handed her. She rose, and stood for a moment with her hand against the wall before
she went into the salon. None of the questions she had asked herself were answered. The baster on
room. Less physician could have yet arabic merely. Three pcp but doorstep did not come many silence.

 I have had it
always. I have come over to beg you to marry me."

"It's impossible! Can't you see it's impossible?"

"You don't love me?" he said. Into those few words was thrown all the suffering of his silent
years.

"I don't know what I feel for you," she answered in an agonized voice, her fingers tightening
over the backs of her white hands. "If reverence be love--if trust be love, infinite and absolute
trust--if gratitude be love--if emptiness after you are gone be a sign of it--yes, I love you.
If the power to see clearly only through you, to interpret myself only by your aid be love,
I acknowledge it. I tell you so freely, as of your right to know. And the germ of which you
spoke is you. You have grown until you have taken possession of--of what is left of me. If
I had only been able to see clearly from the first, Peter, I should be another woman to-day,
a whole woman, a wise woman. Oh, I have thought of it much. The secret of life was there at
my side from the time I was able to pronounce your name, and I couldn't see it. You had it.
You stayed. You took duty where you found it, and it has made you great. Oh, I don't mean to
speak in a worldly sense. When I say that, it is to express the highest human quality of which
I can think and feel. But I can't marry you. You must see it."

"I cannot see it," he replied, when he had somewhat gained control of himself.

"Because I should be wronging you."

"How?" he asked.

"In the first place, I should be ruining your career."

"If I had a career," he said, smiling gently, "you couldn't ruin it. You both overestimate
and underestimate the world's opinion, Honora. As my wife, it will not treat you cruelly. And
as for my career, as you call it, it has merely consisted in doing as best I could the work
that has come to me. I have tried to serve well those who have employed me, and if my services
be of value to them, and to those who may need me in the future, they are not going to reject
me. If I have any worth in the world, you will but add to it. Without you I am incomplete."

She looked up at him wonderingly.

"Yes, you are great," she said. "You pity me, you think of my loneliness."

"It is true I cannot bear to picture you here," he exclaimed. "The thought tortures me, but
it is because I love you, because I wish to take and shield you. I am not a man to marry a
woman without love. It seems to me that you should know me well enough to believe that, Honora.
There never has been any other woman in my life, and there never can be. I have given you proof
of it, God knows."

"I am not what I was," she said, "I am not what I was. I have been dragged down."

He bent and lifted her hand from her knee, and raised it to his lips, a homage from him that
gave her an exquisite pain.

"If you had been dragged down," he answered simply, "my love would have been killed. I know
something of the horrors you have been through, as though I had suffered them myself. They
might have dragged down another woman, Honora. But they have strangely ennobled you."

She drew her hand away.

"No," she said, "I do not deserve happiness. It cannot be my destiny."

"Destiny," he repeated. "Destiny is a thing not understandable by finite minds. It is not necessarily
continued tragedy and waste, of that I am certain. Only a little thought is required, it seems
to me, to assure us that we cannot be the judges of our own punishment on this earth. And of
another world we know nothing. It cannot be any one's destiny to throw away a life while still
something may be made of it. You would be throwing your life away here. That no other woman
is possible, or ever can be possible, for me should be a consideration with you, Honora. What
I ask of you is a sacrifice--will you make me happy?"
