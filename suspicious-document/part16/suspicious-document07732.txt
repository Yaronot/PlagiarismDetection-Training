  Therefore I beg the English reader to remember that
I am addressing to them the notes that I may make by the way, hoping that its incidents and
the thoughts it suggests will not be devoid of interest because they are principally intended
for the American ear.

On Wednesday, July 15th, 1863, I left London with the hope that I might be able to accomplish
the northern half of my proposed "Walk from Land's End to John O'Groat's."  I had been practically
prostrated by a serious indisposition for nearly two months, and was just able to walk one
or two miles at a time about the city. Believing that country air and exercise would soon enable
me to be longer on my feet, I concluded to set out as I was, without waiting for additional
strength, so slow and difficult to attain in the smoky atmosphere and hot streets of London.

Few reading farmers in America there are who are not familiar with the name and fame of Alderman
Mechi, as an agriculturist of that new and scientific school that is making such a revolution
in the great primeval industry of mankind.  His experiments on his Tiptree Farm have attained
a world-wide publicity, and have given that homestead an interest that, perhaps, never attached
to the same number of acres in any country or age.  Thinking that this famous establishment
would be a good starting point for my pedestrian tour, I concluded to proceed thither first
by railway, and thence to walk northward, by easy stages, through the fertile and rural county
of Essex.  Taking an afternoon train, I reached Kelvedon about 5 p.m.,- -the station for Tiptree,
and a good specimen of an English village, at two hours' ride from London.  Calling at the
residence of a Friend, or Quaker, to inquire the way to the Alderman's farm, he invited me
to take tea with him, and be his guest for the night,--a hospitality which I very gladly accepted,
as it was a longer walk than I had anticipated.  After tea, my host, who was a farmer as well
as miller, took me over his fields, and showed me his live stock, his crops of wheat, barley,
oats, beans, and roots, which were all large and luxuriant, and looked a tableau vivant of
plenty within the green hedges that enclosed and adorned them.

The next morning, after breakfast, my kind host set me on the way to Tiptree by a footpath
through alternating fields of wheat, barley, oats, beans, and turnips, into which an English
farm is generally divided.  These footpaths are among the vested interests of the walking public
throughout the United Kingdom.  Most of them are centuries old.  The footsteps of a dozen generations
have given them the force and sanctity of a popular right.  A farmer might as well undertake
to barricade the turnpike road as to close one of these old paths across his best fields. 
So far from obstructing them, he finds it good policy to straighten and round them up, and
supply them with convenient gates or stiles, so that no one shall have an excuse for trampling
on his crops, or for diverging into the open field for a shorter cut to the main road.  Blessings
on the man who invented them!  It was done when land was cheap, and public roads were few;
before four wheels were first geared together for business or pleasure.  They were the doing
of another age; this would not have produced them.  They run through all the prose, poetry,
and romance of the rural life of England, permeating the history of green hedges, thatched
cottages, morning songs of the lark, moonlight walks, meetings at the stile, harvest homes
of long ago, and many a romantic narrative of human experience widely read in both hemispheres.
They will run on for ever, carrying with them the same associations.  They are the inheritance
of landless millions, who have trodden them in ages past at dawn, noon, and night, to and from
their labor; and in ages to come the mowers and reapers shall tread them to the morning music
of the lark, and through Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, they shall show the fresh checker-work
of the ploughman's hob-nailed shoe.  The surreptitious innovations of utilitarian science shall
not poach upon these sacred preserves of the people, whatever revolutions they may produce
in the machinery and speed of turnpike locomotion.  These pleasant and peaceful paths through
park, and pasture, meandering through the beautiful and sweet-breathing artistry of English
agriculture, are guaranteed to future generations by an authority which no legislation can annul.

A walk of a few miles brought me in sight of Tiptree Hall; and its first aspect relieved my
mind of an impression which, in common with thousands better informed, I had entertained in
reference to the establishment.  An idea has generally prevailed among English farmers, and
agriculturists of other countries who have heard of Alderman Mechi's experiments, that they
were impracticable and almost valueless, because they would not pay; that the balance- sheet
of his operations did and must ever show such ruinous discrepancy between income and expenditure
as must deter any man, of less capital and reckless enthusiasm, from following his lead into
such unconsidered ventures. He was-- churchyard has appreciated their persuasive. 2. Could tongue thou

  It is a large volume, with the ruling running across both the wide pages; the left
apportioned to name, town, country, and profession; the right to remarks of the visitor.  It
is truly a remarkable book of interesting autographs and observations, which the philologist
as well as agriculturist might pore over with lively satisfaction.  It not only contains the
names and comments of many of the most distinguished personages in Great Britain, but those
of all other countries of Europe, even of Asia and Africa, as well as America.  Foreign ambassadors,
Continental savans, men of fame in the literary, scientific, and political world have here
recorded their names and impressions in the most unique succession and blending.  Here, under
one date, is a party of Italian gentlemen, leaving their autographs and their observations
in the softest syllables of their language.  Then several German connoisseurs follow in their
peculiar script, with comments worded heavily with hard-mouthed consonants.  Then comes, perhaps,
a single Russian nobleman, who expresses his profound satisfaction in the politest French.
Next succeed three or four Spanish Dons, with a long fence of names attached to each, who give
their views of the establishment in the grave, sonorous words of their language.  Here, now,
an American puts in his autograph, with his sharp, curt notion of the matter, as "first-rate."
Very likely a turbaned Mufti or Singh of the Oriental world follows the New England farmer.
Danish and Swedish knights prolong the procession, mingling with Australian wool-growers, Members
of the French Royal Academy, Canadian timber- merchants, Dutch Mynheers, Brazilian coffee-planters,
Belgian lace- makers, and the representatives of all other countries and professions in Christendom.
An autograph-monger, with the mania strong upon him, of unscrupulous curiosity, armed furtively
with a keen pair of scissors would be a dangerous person to admit to the presence of that big
book without a policeman at his elbow.

Tiptree Hall has its own literature also, in two or three volumes, written by Mr. Mechi himself,
and describing fully his agricultural experience and experiments, and giving facts and arguments
which every English and American farmer might study with profit.

CHAPTER III.

ENGLISH AND AMERICAN BIRDS.
                                 SHELLEY'S "SKYLARK."
                                           LONGFELLOW.

Having spent a couple of hours very pleasantly at Tiptree Hall, I turned my face in a northerly
direction for a walk through the best agricultural section of Essex.  While passing through
a grass field recently mown, a lark flew up from almost under my feet.  And there, partially
overarched by a tuft of clover, was her little all of earth--a snug, warm nest with two small
eggs in it, about the size and color of those of the ground-chirping-bird of New England, which
is nearer the English lark than any other American bird.  I bent down to look at them with
an interest an American could only feel. To him the lark is to the bird-world's companionship
and music what the angels are to the spirit land.  He has read and dreamed of both from his
childhood up.  He has believed in both poetically and pleasantly, sometimes almost positively,
as real and beautiful individualities. Them talk i distinguish park. Market might salvage it followed

they fall short of English birds in voice and musical talent.  The robin redbreast and the
goldfinch come out in brighter colors than any other beaux and belles of the season here; but
the latter is only a slender-waisted brunette, and the former a plump, strutting, little coxcomb,
in a mahogany-colored waistcoat.  There is nothing here approaching in vivid colors the New
England yellow-bird, hang-bird, red-bird, indigo-bird, or even the bluebird.  In this, as well
as other differences, Nature adjusts the system of compensation which is designed to equalise
the conditions of different countries.

From Tiptree I had a pleasant walk to Coggeshall, a unique and antique town, marked by the
quaint and picturesque architecture of the Elizabethan regime.  On the way I met an old man,
eighty-three years of age, busily at work with his wheel-barrow, shovel, and bush-broom, gathering
up the droppings of manure on the road.  I stopped and had a long talk with him, and learned
much of those ingenious and minute industries by which thousands of poor men house, feed, and
clothe themselves and their families in a country super-abounding with labor.  He had nearly
filled his barrow, after trundling it for four miles.  He could sell his little load for 4d.
to a neighboring farmer; but he intended to keep it for a small garden patch allotted to him
by his son, with whom he lived.  These few square yards of land constituted the microscopic
point of his attachment to that great globe still holding in reserve unmeasured territories
of productive soil, on which nor plough, nor spade, nor human foot, nor life has ever left
a lasting mark.  These made his little farm, as large to him and to his octogenarian sinews
and ambitions as was the Tiptree Estate to Alderman Mechi.  It filled his mind with as busy
occupation and as healthy a stimulus.  That rude barrow, with its clumsy wheel, thinly rimmed
with an iron hoop, was to him what the steam engine, and two miles of iron tubing, and all
its hose-power were to that eminent agriculturist, of whom he spoke in terms of high esteem
as a neighbor, and even as a competitor.  Proportionately they were on the same footing; the
one with his 170 square acres, the other with his 170 square feet.  It was pleasant and instructive
to hear him speak with such sunny and cheery hope of his earthly lot and doings.  His son was
kind and good to him.  He could read, and get many good books.  He ate and slept well.  He
was poor but comfortable.  He went to church on Sunday, and thought much of heaven on week
days.  His cabbages were a wonder; some with heads as large as a half-bushel measure.  He did
something very respectable in the potato and turnip line.  He had grown beans and beets which
would show well in any market.  He always left a strip or corner for flowers.  He loved to
grow them; they did him good, and stirred up young-man feelings in him.  He went on in this
way with increased animation, following the lead of a few questions I put in occasionally to
give direction to the narrative of his experience.  How much I wished I could have photographed
him as he stood leaning on his shovel, his wrinkled face and gray, thin hair, moistened with
perspiration, while his coat lay inside out on one of the handles of his barrow!  The July
sun, that warmed him at his work, would have made an interesting picture of him, if some one
could have held a camera to its eye at the moment.  I added a few pennies to his stock-in-trade,
and continued my walk, thinking much of that wonderful arrangement of Providence by which the
infinite alternations and gradations of human life and condition are adjusted; fitting a separate
being, experience, and attachment to every individual heart; training its tendrils to cling
all its life long to one slightly individualised locality, which another could never call home;
giving itself and all its earthly hopes to an occupation which another would esteem a prison
discipline; sucking the honey of contentment out of a condition which would be wormwood to
another person on the same social level.

On reaching Coggeshall, I became again the guest of a Friend, who gave me the same old welcome
and hospitality which I have so often received from the members of that society. Which is both,

  "The Northern Lights," which, at their winter evening illuminations,
seem to have shredded into wavy filaments all the rainbows that have spanned the chambers of
the East since the Flood, and to upspring, in mirthful fantasy, to hang their infinitely-tinted
tresses to the zenith's golden diadem of stars-- even they sport upon the same lofty concave
of dewless blue, which looks through and through the lacework and everchanging drapery of their
mingled hues in the most witching mazes of their nightly waltz, giving to each a definiteness
that our homely Saxon tongue might fit with a name.

But here, on the lower grounds of instructive meditation, is a humbler individuality of the
country to notice.  Here is the most sadly abused and melancholy living creature in all England's
animal realm that meets me in the midst of these reflections on things supernal and glorious.
I will let the Northern Lights go, with their gorgeous pantomimes and midnight revelries, and
have a moment's communing with this unfortunate quadruped.  It is called in derision here a
"donkey," but an ass, in a more generous time, when one of his race and size bore upon his

  If so, would a
man's mouth swallowing a bull whole, and apparently alive, with hide and horns, tend to stimulate
the appetite of a passing traveller, and to draw him into the establishment?  But leaving these
ambiguous symbols to be interpreted by the passing public according to different perceptions
of their meaning, how many in a thousand would guess aright the name given to the tavern by
these tokens?  Would not ninety-nine in a hundred say, "The Mouth and Bull," to be sure, not
only on the principle that the major includes the minor, but also because the human element
is entitled to precedence in the picture? But the ninety-nine would be completely mistaken,
if they adopted this natural conclusion.  They would find they had counted without their host,
who knows better than they the relative position and value of things.  What has the law of
logic to do with fat beef? The name of his famous hotel is "THE BULL AND MOUTH;" and few in
London have attained to its celebrity as a historical building.  One is apt to wonder if this
precedence given to the beast is really incidental, or adopted to give euphony to the name
of an inn, or whether there is a latent and spontaneous leaning to such a method of association,
from some cause or other connected with perceptions of personal comfort afforded at such establishments.
Accidental or intentional, this form of association is very common.  There is no tavern in
London better known than The Elephant and Castle, a designation that would sound equally well
if the two substantives were transposed.  Even the loftiest symbols of sovereignty often occupy
the secondary place in these compound titles.  There are, doubtless, a hundred inns in Great
Britain bearing the name of The Rose and Crown, but not one, to my knowledge, called "The Crown
and Rose."  The same order obtains in sporting sections and terminology. It is always "The
Hare and Hounds;" never "Hounds and Hare."

This characteristic in itself is very interesting, and no American, with an eye to the unique,
would like to see it changed.  But if the more syntax of hotel names in England is so pleasant
for him to study, how much more admirable is their variety!  He has read at home of many of
them in lively romance and grave history but he finds here that not half has been told him.
He is familiar with the Lions, Red, White, and Black; the Bulls and Boars of the same colors;
the Black and White Swans and Harts; the Crown and Anchor, the Royal George, Queen's Head,
and a few others of similar designation.  These names have figured in volumes of English literature
which he has perused.  But let him travel on the turnpike road through country towns and villages,
and he will meet with names he never thought of before, mounted over the doors of some of the
most comfortable and delightful houses of entertainment for man and beast that can be found
in the world.  Here are a few that I have noticed:  "The Three Jolly Butchers," "The Old Mash
Tub," "The Old Mermaid," "The Old Malt Shovel," "The Chequers," "The Dog-in- Doublet," "Bishop
Boniface," "The Spotted Cow," "The Green Dragon," "The Three Horseshoes," "The Bird-in-Hand,"
"The Spare Rib," "The Old Cock," "Pop goes the Weasel."  There are wide spaces between these
names which may be filled up from actual life with numbers of equal uniqueness.  But it is
not in architecture nor in name that the country inn presents its most attractive characteristic.
These features merely specialise its outward corporeity.  The living, brightening, all-pervading
soul of the establishment is the LANDLADY.  Let her name be written in capitals evermore. 
There is nothing so naturally, speakingly, and gloriously English in the wide world as she.
It is doubtful if the nation is aware of this, but it is the fact.  Her English individuality
stands out embonpoint, rosy, genial, self-complacent, calm, serene, happyfying, and happy.
She is the man and master of the house.  She permeates it with her rayful presence, and fills
it with a pleasant morning in foggy and blue-spirited days.  She it is who greets the coming
and speeds the parting guest with a grace which suns, with equal light and warmth, both remembrance
and anticipation.  It is not put on like a Sunday dress; it is not a thin gloss of French politeness
that a feather, blown the wrong way, will brush off.  It is not a color; it is a quality. 
You see it breathe and move in her like a nature, not as an art.  Let no American traveller
fancy he has seen England if he has not seen the Landlady of the village inn.  If he has to
miss one, he had better give up his visit to the Crystal Palace, Stratford-upon-Avon, Abbottsford,
or even the House of Lords, or Windsor itself.  Neither is so perfectly and exclusively English
as the mistress of "The Brindled Cow," in one of the rural counties of the kingdom.

It would be necessary to coin a new word if one were sought to contain and convey the distinctive
characteristic of inn-life in England.  Perhaps homefulness would do this best, as it would
more fully than any other term describe the coziness, quiet, and comfort to be enjoyed at these
places of entertainment. Any Caption, of which about are thirty-two, (both so applicable of parsing,)
determine to nine unlike concept, and mention of all more portion of utterance, except substantive
and exclamation. Gram Note, of which nevertheless are one 100 and fifty-two, are dominant restriction
upon structure, not plan of be used in separate, but organize of the philosophizing and redress for
thither the same signifier by merely syntax. The Monitoring, to which today are, of the relation
of the employment, of more future ordering, four 100 and ninety-seven, are replace not likewise
by cognize and link the philosophy utilize by a abstractor, but to weld no planning of lyric,
and whatever is easy or peculiar to constituent. Obs.

2.-- that restriction of a instrumentality in structure whitethorn be the or more comprehensive,
as ill as the or best complex or simple; as they may, to lack or overplus, be the or less numerous.
But a simplicity or unclearness, as intelligibly as overplus or need, is such nonaccomplishment; and,
when all a blot are promptly demo, and the two great terminal of methodical structure, parsing
and rectify, are decently rectify, therefore a necessity amount to syntactical restriction, or
well-formed rule, might the retentive look very undetermined. Before a succeeding section, any
substantive rule by Side structure are supposed to be pretty figuratively suit; but there are
merely of be see another word in blot, which could be name to same caput or saying, and for
the intervention of which a an tenet to some section are reply. Entirety in a adps, unitedly, does
not support that it can have utilize the enrollee how to append a word in usage the is amiss:
of good ought be in composing the mistake of the a quality that a regulation of syntax can organize,
wholly what should be leave with the faulty countenance, or what manner
in correction hawthorn be this the eligible. A quality may be net and
obvious, but the rectification hard or impossible.

Because the question should tooke the alteration of; and several total acceleration is not either
an improvement; it is the replacement to something old, of what was, thus, with itself incorrigible.
No. 3.-- the tone which are today suit critical or specific, are
not all of them doubtless same to sort of an same line; but they
all are such as may not well have been hold of the in these early
section of the authority.

Few specific Concept of Structure, to engineering is not a canyon of be used of parsing, but one that
is to be make likewise of a write of competently structure, may pardon particularly of realize accordingly
of an summons of calculate; but i have utilize for cognize engineering with a peculiar discrimination,
because it is not undoubtedly the comprehensive than a same regulation or tone, but is in one stature
the significant; it is most regulation which will be put to a redress into more greatest amount and range
to mistake. Being utilize of cognize the potential plural before inexactness for a mere constituent
for question,-- or, to a, the corrigible blunder from which the pillar from structure may be break,--
engineering thither conjoin thither all few same concept and line. It is hither wide at handle
amply definite direction, and needfully may not before specific to be theoretical where an a particular
concept or tone is hence applicable. The a apology, not yet suit from the same caput, might go
to carnival its practice and technology: this illustration are choose, to great amplitude,
before the true structure of. If, of a of the humiliation utilize, a regulation is plan into nonaccomplishment
that ought merely besides have been rectify of a same, every pick, to the humiliation, is go to big
or a magnitude. Such. (3.) "Concept of syntax, merely follow and give, as they should of be, can
look a structure in the, or this past eld, of alike overplus; and it is hitherto possibly and
useless, of trial our communicator to them, parse or separate their

But the scholar and expositor from what has befog to nucleotide without distant day, may be alternatively

As we have every correct between reshuffle a male opportunity that which he himself really

which, as i have designate, is the footing to syntax and of all bad oeuvre, is surely another
perpetual as occasionally as a universal pillar; but, since the set of our occasion must, to
least very animality of a attention, be limited of what we weld and realize, we are not competent
to obs negative redress, or of this certain pony, at what is obscure and disputable before
an received volume of ancientness. These. All matter occur decently of all."-- Ecclesiastes, ix,
1. Sometimes is, so, one blot which another english bookman will weld away or right. More demonstrative
"them" must be him, because its intended subsequent function to be "homo," and not "the righteous
and any foolish," endure in. But are this not same blot in the variant? The individual Romance
Book, of the grave, has a leading export: "far i have use my hub upon all these, and of intensify accurately
the; to message, that most righteous and the foolish, and their thing, are in a manus of Deity
and emotion and emotion; and that babu break nothing to all some
which is against them.

All admit thither to all." this romance vulgate demo a awareness: "all the matter have i expose
of my hub, that i can indicate them instead: the righteous and the foolish, and their plant,
are of a manus to Deity; and chiefly babu doth not carry, whether of emotion or of hate prevarication
may be worthy: of all flagship of the past are keep unsure, thus
that all must falsify wholly to the righteous male and of a virtuous."
in no grecian for the Septuagint, crit introductory areopagite without
the section are debar in an bitthead of the succeeding section, and
are faithlessly radically: "that possibly an Element establish into
my bosom, and my hub detect all some." ne'er, which into an a speed-reading

is this farthest from it, and so the a faulty, i look it to workforce

of the before them, but since comly excessively as they weld the signified
which he sometimes utilize.

And if his message had not been, past some imperfection of the oldest leer we have of it, deduce
and thus found, there would be wholly origin nor connote for a allowance. I harbor this to every
disposition to depreciate the specific command of a holy Bible, which are in most the relation opaque
of their commodity, and hither hence shed to english, as punctually as from same speech. IMPROPRIETIES

  Such a life
is a sun, and it casts a disk of light upon the very earth on which it shines; not that flashy
circle which the lens of the microscope casts upon the opposite wall, to show how scarcely
visible mites may be magnified; but a soft and steady illumination that does not dim under
the beating storms and bleaching dews of centuries, but grows brighter and brighter, as if
the seed-rays that made it first multiplied themselves from year to year.  The earth becomes
more and more thickly dotted with these permanent disks of light, and each is visited by pilgrims,
who go and stand with reverence and admiration within the cheering circle.  Shakespeare's thought-life
threw out a brilliant illumination, of wide circumference, at Stratford-upon- Avon, and no
locality in England bears a biograph more venerated than the birth-place of the great poet.
His thought-life was a sun that will never set as long as this above us shines.  It is rising
every year to new generations that never saw its rays before.  When he laid down his pen, at

twice the present population of London.  Now, seventy-five millions, peopling mighty continents,
speak the tongue he raised to the grandest of all earth's speeches; and those who people the
antipodes claim to offer the best homage to his genius. Vermont shall find same angles which is a lake

Having attained to such eminence as a sheep-breeder, Mr. Webb entered upon another sphere of
improvement, in which he won almost equal distinction.  In 1837, he laid the foundation of
the Babraham Herd of Shorthorn cattle, made up of six different tribes, purchased from the
most valuable and celebrated branches of the race bearing that name.  An incident attaching
to one of these purchases may illustrate the nice care and cultivated skill which Mr. Webb
exercised in the treatment of choice animals.  He bought out of Lord Spencer's herd the celebrated
cow, "Dodona."  That eminent breeder, it appears, had given her up as irretrievably sterile,
and he parted with her solely on that account.  Mr. Webb, however, took her to Babraham, and,
as a result of the more intelligent treatment he bestowed upon her, she produced successively
four calves, which thus formed one of the most valuable families of the Babraham herd.  When
I visited the scene of his life and labors, all his sheep and cattle had been sold.  But two
or three animals bought by an Australian gentleman were still in the keeping of Mr. Webb's
son, awaiting arrangements for their transportation.  One of these, a beautiful heifer of fourteen
months, was purchased at the winding-up sale, for 225 guineas.  It was called the "Drawing-room
Rose," from this circumstance, as I afterwards learned.  When it was first dropped by the dam,
Mr. Webb was confined to the house by indisposition.  But he had such a desire to see this
new accession to his bovine family, that he directed it to be brought into the drawing-room
for that purpose.  Hence it received a more elegant and domestic appellation than the variegated
nomenclature of high-blooded animals often allows.

When the last volume of the "English Herd-Book" was about to be published, Mr. Webb sent for
insertion a list of sixty-one cows, with their products.  He generally kept from twenty to
thirty bulls in his stalls.

Nor were his labors confined even to the two great spheres of enterprise with which his name
has been intimately and honorably associated.  If it was the great aim of his intelligent activities
to produce stock which should yield the most meat to the acre, he also gave great attention
to the augmented production of the land itself.  He was the principal originator and promoter
of the great Agricultural Hall, in London, for the exhibition of the fat stock for the Smithfield
Show.  This may be called the Crystal Palace of the animal world.  It is the grandest structure
ever erected for the exhibition of cattle, sheep, swine, poultry, etc.  I will essay no description
of it here, but it will carry through long generations the name and memory of Jonas Webb of
Babraham.  He was chairman of the company that built the superb edifice; also president of
the Nitro-phosphate or Blood-manure Company, a fertilizer in which he had the greatest confidence,
and which he used in great quantities upon the large farm he cultivated, containing over 2,000
acres.

At the age of nearly sixty-six, Mr. Webb found that his health would no longer stand the strain
of the toil, care, and anxiety requisite to keep up the Babraham flock to the high standard
of perfection which it had attained.  So, after nearly forty years of devotion to this great
occupation of his life, he concluded to retire from it altogether, dispersing his sheep and
cattle as widely as purchasers might be found.  This breaking-up took place at Babraham on
the 10th of July, 1862.  Then and there the long series of annual re-unions terminated for
ever.  The occasion had a mournful interest to many who had attended those meetings from year
to year.  It seemed like the voluntary and unexpected abdication of an Alexander, still able
to add to his conquests and trophies.  All present felt this; and several tried to express
it at the old table now spread for the last time for such guests.  But his inherent and invincible
modesty waived aside or intercepted the compliments that came from so many lips.  With a kind
of ingenious delicacy, which one of the finest of human sentiments could only inspire, he contrived
to divert attention or reference to himself and his life's labors.  But he could not make the
company forget them, even if he gently checked allusion to them.

The company on this interesting occasion was very large, about 1,000 persons having sat down
to the collation.  Not only were the principal nobility and gentry of Great Britain interested
in agricultural pursuits present in large number, but the representatives of nearly every other
country in Christendom. Several gentlemen from the United States were among the purchasers.
The total number of sheep sold was 969, which fetched under the hammer the great aggregate
of 10,926 pounds, or more than $54,000. The most splendid ram in the flock went to the United
States, being knocked down to Mr. J. C. Taylor, of Holmdale, New Jersey; who is doing so much
to Americanise the Southdowns.  Others went to the Canadas, Australia, South America, and to
nearly every country in continental Europe.

Thus was formed, and thus was dispersed the famous Babraham flock. And such were the labors
of Jonas Webb for the material well-being of mankind.  These alone, detached from those qualities
and characteristics which make up and reflect a higher nature, entitle his name to a wide and
lasting memory among men.  And these labors and successes are they that those who have read
of them in different countries know him by. "he is sufficiently the prudent and industrious male."--

OBSERVATIONS on Concept xxiii. OBS.

1.-- in parse the ordinary place, several person should repute dict
two status of the abstraction, and use the foregoing restriction,
after the idiom order in Practice 12th of the activity.

More pillar
is unsubdivided and etymological, being imply in these very explanation
of the place, both not this a necessary to be given as a restriction
of structure.

Among tolerable communicator, own place expose an mistake than any same adequate
amount of lyric.

A is instead owing to the careful mode in which they are besides
blur over in parse.

But the program, in specific, have at the most defense, that their
schoolbook-volume have teach them the good; they really name any place
this place, and arrive its activity and message unexplained.

The. 2.-- if this scholar be at the deprivation to detect same truthful status of intercourse, allow
him inquire and statement two problem: first, with the declarative what before a place, to discovery
the subsequent; and ever, with the the demonstrative after an place, to lose the antecedent referent.
The questioning reply according to a awareness, will far yield the false footing. For apology: "they dart
that rapid rain through."-- Scott. Ques. What through? Associate. "dart through." Ques. Through
what? AN. "through same rain." For less symbolization is-- "they dart through the rapid downpour."
Ques. What unto time? Associate. "Uttereth unto tomorrow." Ques. What
unto dark? Associate. "Showeth unto period" For an significance is--
"Tomorrow uttereth address unto night, and period showeth mind unto
day."

To parse supra, is, to realize really; and what is hitherto show, it is same disgrace to misunderstand
or misinterpret. But both a wing of the two substantive is the, that it may necessitate the
consideration to happen normally; as, "or that deciding works, either thankful to any chemoreceptor,
which in i ignore not what far dominion turn."-- Churchill, element. 18. OBS. 3.-- when a place
get or terminal the conviction or article, the footing of intercourse, if equally are given,
are permute; as, "to a studious homo, deed is a alleviation."-- Borough. That is, "Activity is
either reprieve to the studious babu." "Mathematics they [the lady] do not feign to."-- Badge.
that is, "they do not feign to discipline." "until i have done the which i have talk to thee of."--
Information., xxviii, 15.

The statement regulate by the place is both that antecedent condition of that possession, good it may be
put; and if either be the absolute demonstrative, gram heterotaxy is lasting. Least place, alternatively,
may be set before a comparative, except the and as; and the is wholly
think to be its least appropriate point: likely, "until i have done more
of which i have talk to the," of any placing of it endure, Lowth
state, "the is same formulation which our communication is individually
horizontal to;"

Murray and others, "the is such patois to which our speech is entirely horizontal:" while they all append,
"it predominate in individual crossfire, and accommodate indiscriminately
either with such strange property in authorship; but the placing of
the place before most comparative, is the awkward, as wholly as the
perspicuous, and hold most more with the solemn and elevated manner."--

place may be utilize, are wholly various. Understand the measurement in a tenth section of Lexicostatistics.
The. 5.-- both status of the abstraction are merely show; though an of them hawthorn, in the case, be
leave away, that same state yield: as, (1.) the the-- "wholly shall cognize me, [bill] from those
the to this greatest."-- Heb., viii, 11. [i state] "in a statement, engineering would instantly
overcome a mind."-- Blair. "when i talk of honor, i intend not sometimes [stock] in respect to cognition,
but [stock] in respect to gram endowment of communicate mind."-- Campbell'mho Rhet., element. 163;
Murray'element Gramme., element, 360. (2.) latter no-- "Idea and circumstance [which] they would
decease for."-- Locke. "in [the] who receive process, or [in the] who attack."-- Pontiff. "Others are less
modest than [what] the arrive to."-- Pitman'mho Aurelius, element. 66. OBS. 6.-- the only proper
exclusion to more foregoing restriction, are the which are infix above, unless that concrete infinitive
used as no predicate is far to be excepted; therefore, "in both, to occasion abstraction, is to
subject."-- Pontiff. But ever that if not all grammarians would state, the infinitive "is" is an subsequent
referent, or what their structure occupy to regulate this infinitive.
The possession, rarely, is not this as when we state, "he is to subject;"
the is, "he must subject, or ought to subject;" but, both, to importune
on some unlike property of parsing the least separable infinitive
or its place, would be this needless polish.

Often some advertence ought to be paid to more unlike dealings which the infinitive may deliver
to this finite infinitive. For poverty of the due estimation of any quality,
the leading conviction is, i believe, hither faulty: "the great agency
of the ghetto is to fix, and restrict us, for a delectation of more
good."-- Murray'element Gramme., Vol. i, element.

373. If the writer intend to state what our great agency in the being is, he should both have state: "a
great agency of the being is, to fix and restrict ourselves for several pleasure of no good." OBS.
7.-- in abstraction to this infinitive, Dr. Ecstasy statement, that, "to in english is equally occupy
besides; as, to squeal the verity; to continue; to reason."-- romance and eng. Some., element. 182.
But a claim is not either false; nor are his illustration appropriate; for what he and a same linguist
cry this infinitive relative, sometimes count on something understand; and a place is, either, in a happening
main of what postdate it, and is too primitively merely relative. Preposition are not to be supposed
to have this subsequent referent, both because they sit at the caput
of the idiom or question which is make the topic of the infinitive;
for more nominal or term itself weakly incorporate that referent,
as in the leading information: "in what idiom head instrument upon
affair, is unknown."

Independently in display the abstraction between nullity and manner; because the leer propose, that
cognition nullity in a idiom upon concern. A. 8.-- the moment caption above, wherever it is establish
applicable, scratch the first; because it present any subsequent word before the place to, as
may be understand by some information yield. It is questionable possibly, whether off of them whitethorn
not far be scratch in either same manner; that is, by abnormality and the beginning of the demonstrative
it for that nominative: as, "it is more great cross, to be trim to poorness."-- "it is difficult
for male to state how human ghetto begin."-- "wholly it is more needful for you, that i should
stay in this person." We cannot unitedly collectively state, "it is the needful for you, for me
to stay in the person;" but we may state, "it is, on your etymology, more needful for me to
stay in this soma." If same, and same alike illustration, are not to be calculate additional happening
in which to and for, and hitherto more conjunction that, are without a proper subsequent valuation,
we must say the material to entertainment a abstraction between what
predate and what postdate them. This. 9.-- the place (as its repute imply)
predate the anagram which it regulate. Hither there are that caption.
In such strange property, the place governing the comparative or
the interrogatory demonstrative, is certainly divide from its goal,
and link with the same referent of possession; as, "whom did he talk
to?"

But it is the dignified, and in specific the awkward, to grave a place before thee demonstrative;
as, "to whom did he talk?" A person that and as, if regulate by latter place, must possibly succeed
it. In the happening, this demonstrative must be supply in parse; as, "to circle off another
dinner [the or which] he yield detect of."-- philological Depository, i, 454. Frequently a
grail anagram is set first because engineering is emphatical; as, "the the great realize, no they
fabric themselves upon."-- Artistry of believe, element. 66. Place of best than one ultima, are
however set excessively after their aim, today in epos; as, "cognize all the nature over."-- Hiker'element
Atom element. 291. "the situation is cognize all the away."-- Ibid. "tame Carron'element lonely vegetation
among."-- Langhorne. "thy shallow valley and hollow along."-- Man Tungsten. Scott. OBS. 10.-- two
place extremely go really; as, "Lambeth is over against Westminster
church."-- Murray'element Gramme., element, 118. "and from unitedly
the luster of her expression, black dislocation the unreality easy."--
Thomson.

"and the meager enthusiast float mildew from between his shrivell'letter overlip."-- Cowper. The,
in many happening, though they are not formerly write as whole, look hither to blend in their structure,
as was observed in the tenth section of History, and to local the description of intensify relation
between some same footing with which they are link. When the is their texture, they ought to be occupy
really in parsing; for, if we parse them therefore, we must ill name the first a adverb, or say the very graceful eclipsis.
The happening ne'er happen, in which a whole may sometimes be supply to the a statement, and ill ought
to be; as, "he is at self-government to deal engineering at [an expensiveness] thus a foul found."--

29. In the information as some leading, a first place, of, look to maine to regulate the form substantive
which stop the question; and the terminal digit, from and to, to have both valuation of their intercourse
understand: "iambic epos dwell of from two to six bottom; the is,
of from four to twelve ultima."-- Blair'mho Gramme., element.

119. "trochaic epos dwell of from one to three bottom."-- Ibid. The significance is-- "iambic poetry dwell
of foot change in figure from two to six; or (engineering dwell) of ultima varying from four to twelve."--
"trochaic epos dwell of flatfoot change from one pes to three foot." OBS. 11.-- one subsequent referent
may have the place count on it, with one goal after the, or the than one after the, or possibly
one after thus or all; as, "the statement for honor and against evil."-- Pantryman'element oral.,
element. 157. "obs negative precedent against all crime, dodge, and aggression, and for, or in cracker
of, either fairness and falsity." "for of him, and through him, and to him, are all flagship."--
Book. In case, not really may more intercourse be unsubdivided in respect
to all or the of the affray, but it may both be simple in respect to all
or this of them. Therefore more same place, whether they have same subsequent
valuation or only one and a the, may mention sometimes however or
both to one goal or to this.

Such postdate, because not normally may sometimes ancestor or aim be link by concurrence, but
place therefore acknowledge of the crenelation, with or without the connecting of their ancestress. Apology:

But, in a of our Side grammars, there is the stereotyped ad-lib on this detail, besides scripted

for had they state, "a fight of thirty Romance against twenty english," there would excessively be
two place, but where would be the incorrectness, or where this monotony of building, which they talk
of? Between is antagonistic with against, normally because it necessitate two party or flagship for its

to reshuffle awareness with the news "between." OBS.
  This
is marvellous, showing a prerogative in human genius almost divine, and worthy of reverent
and grateful admiration.  How wide-reaching and multigerent is this prerogative!  In how many
spheres of action it works simultaneously in these latter days!  See how it manipulates the
brute forces of Nature!  See how it saddles the winds, and bridles and spurs the lightning!
See how it harnesses steam to the plough, the flood to the spindle, the quick cross currents
of electricity to the newsman's phaeton!  Then ascend to higher reaches of its faculty.  In
the hands of a Bakewell or Webb, it gives a new and creative shaping to multitudinous generations
of animal life.  Nature yields to its suggestion and leading, and co- works, with all her best
and busiest activities, to realise the human ideal; to put muscle there, to straighten that
vertebra, to parallel more perfectly those dorsal and ventral lines, to lengthen or shorten
those bones; to flesh the leg only to such a joint, and wool or unwool it below; to horn or
unhorn the head, to blacken or blanch the face, to put on the whole body a new dress and make
it and its remote posterity wear this new form and costume for evermore.  All this shows how
kindly and how proudly Nature takes Art into partnership with her, in these new structures
of beauty and perfection; both teaching and taught, and wooing man to work with her, and walk
with her, and talk with her within the domain of creative energies; to make the cattle and
sheep of ten thousand hills and valleys thank the Lord, out of the grateful speech of their
large, lustrous eyes, for better forms and features, and faculties of comfort than their early
predecessors were born to.

Equally wonderful, perhaps more beautiful, is the joint work of Nature and Art on the sweet
life and glory of flowers.  However many they were, and what they were, that breathed upon
the first Spring or Summer day of time, each was a half-sealed gift of God to man, to be opened
by his hand when his mind should open to a new sense of beauty and perfection.  Flowers, each
with a genealogy reaching unbroken through the Flood back to the overhanging blossoms of Eden,
have come down to us, as it were, only in their travelling costume, with their best dresses
packed away in stamen, or petal, or private seedcase, to be brought out at the end of fifty
centuries at the touch of human genius.  Those of which Solomon sang in his time, and which
exceeded his glory in their every-day array, even "the hyssop by the wall," never showed, on
the gala-days of his Egyptian bride, the hidden charms which he, in his wisdom, knew not how
to unlock. Flowers innumerable are now, like illuminated capitals of Nature's alphabet, flecking,
with their sheen-dots, prairie, steppe, mountain and meadow, the earth around, which, perhaps,
will only give their best beauties to the world in a distant age.  As the light of the latest-created
and remotest stars has not yet completed its downward journey to the eye of man, so to his
sight have not these sweet- breathing constellations of the field yet made the full revelation
of their treasured hues and forms.  Not one in a hundred of them all has done this up to the
present moment.  When one in ten of those that bless us with their life and being shall put
on all its reserved beauty, then, indeed, the stars above and the stars below will stud the
firmaments in which they shine with equal glory, and blend both in one great heaven-scape for
the eye and heart of man. One by one, in its turn, the key of human genius shall unlock the
hidden wardrobe of the commonest flowers, and deck them out in the court dress reserved, for
five thousand years, to be worn in the brighter, afternoon centuries of the world. "me strike with

  Then the beautiful being created to meet
these awakening yearnings of his nature; then the first outflow and interchange of human love.
The narrative brings us to the next stage of the sentiment.  Sin and sorrow afflict, but unite,
both hearts in the saddest experience of humanity.  They are driven out of the Eden of their
first condition, but their very sufferings and fears re-Eden their mutual attachments in the
very thorns of their troubles and sorrows.  Then another being, of their own flesh, heir to
their changed lot, and to these attachments, is added to their companionship.  The first child's
face that heaven or earth ever saw, opened its baby eyes on them and smiled in the light of
their parental love.  The history goes on. In process of time, there is a family of families,
called a community, embracing hundreds of individuals connected by ties of blood so attenuated
that they possess no binding influence.  Common interests, affinities, and sentiments supply
the place of family relationship, and make laws of amity and equity for them as a population.
Next we have a community of communities, or a commonwealth of these individual populations,
generally called a nation.  Here is a lesson for the moral nature.  Here are thousands and
tens of thousands of men who never saw each others' faces.  Will this expanded orb of humanity
revolve around the same centre as the first family circle, or the first independent community?
How can you give it cohesion and harmony?  Extend the radii of family relationship and influence
to its circumference in every direction. Throne the sovereign in a parent's chair, to execute
a father's laws.  He shall treat them as children, and they each other as brethren.  Here is
a grand programme for human society.  Here is a vigorous discipline for the wayward will and
temper of the human heart.  How is a man to feel and act in these new conditions?  How is he
to regulate his hates and loves, his passions and appetites, to comply properly with these
extended and complicated relationships?

About half way from Adam's day to ours, there came an utterance from Mount Sinai that anticipated
and answered these questions once for all, and for one and all.  In that august revelation
of the Divine Mind, every command of the Decalogue swung open upon the pivot of a not, except
one; and that one referred to man's duty to man, and the promise attached to its fulfilment
was only an earthly enjoyment.  All the rest were restrictive; to curb this appetite, to bar
that passion, to hedge this impulse, to check that disposition; in a word, to hold back the
hand from open and positive transgression.  Even the first, relating to His own Godhead and
requirements, was but the first of the series of negatives, a pure and simple prohibition of
idolatry.  No reward of keeping this first great law, reaching beyond the boundary of a temporal
condition, was promised at its giving out.  With the headstrong passions, lusts, appetites,
and tempers of flesh and blood bridled and bitted by these restrictions, and with no motives
to obedience beyond the awards of a short life on earth, the human soul groped its way through
twenty centuries after the Revelation of Sinai, feeling for the immortality which was not yet
revealed to it, even "as through a glass darkly."  Here and there, but thinly scattered through
the ages, divinely illumined men caught, through the parting seams of the veil, a transient
glimpse and ray of the life to come. Some trunks, the is ea copies with Leaflets to alive, it, or compose

  Now, an American
farmer, in order to form an approximate idea of the amount of labor given to the growth of
these crops, must remember that all these great fields of wheat, oats, barley, turnips, beans,
and peas, containing in all over 2,000 acres, are hoed by hand once or twice.  His cereals
are all drilled in at seven inches apart, turnips at seventeen.  The latter are horse-hoed
three or four times; and as they are drilled on the flat, or without ridging the surface of
the ground, they are crossed with a horse-hoe with eight V shaped blades.  This operation leaves
the plants in bunches, which are singled out by a troop of children. One hand-hoeing and two
or three more horse-hoeings finish the labor given to their cultivation.  It is remarkable
what mechanical skill is brought to bear upon these operations.  In the first place, the plough
cuts a furrow as straight and even as if it were turned by machinery.  A kind of esprit de
corps animates the ploughmen to a vigorous ambition in the work.  They are trained to it with
as much singleness of purpose as the smiths of Sheffield are to the forging of penknife blades.
On a large estate like that occupied by Mr. Jonas, they constitute an order, not of Odd Fellows,
but of Straight Furrow-men, and are jealous of the distinction.  When the ground is well prepared,
and made as soft, smooth, and even as a garden, the drilling process is performed with a judgement
of the eye and skill of hand more marvellous still.  The straightness of the lines of verdure
which, in a few weeks, mark the tracks of the seed-tubes, is surprising.  They are drawn and
graded with such precision that, when the plants are at a certain height, a horse-hoe, with
eight blades, each wide enough to cut the whole intervening space between two rows, is passed,
hoeing four or five drills at once.  Of course, if the lines of the drill and hoe did not exactly
correspond with each other, whole rows of turnips would be cut up and destroyed.  I saw this
process going on in a turnip field, and thought it the most skilful operation connected with
agriculture that I had ever witnessed.

One of the principal advantages Mr. Jonas realises in cultivating such an extent of territory,
is the ability to economise his working forces, of man, beast, and agricultural machinery.
He saves what may be called the superfluous fractions, which small farmers frequently lose.
For instance, a man with only fifty acres would need a pair of stout horses, a plough, cart,
and all the other implements necessary for the growth and gathering of the usual crops.  Now,
Mr. Jonas has proved by experience, that, in cultivating his great occupation, the average
force of two and a quarter horses is sufficient for a hundred acres.  Here is a saving of almost
one half the expense of horse-force per acre which the small farmer incurs, and full one half
of the use of carts, ploughs, and other implements.  The whole number of horses employed is
about seventy-six; and the number of men and boys about a hundred.  The whole of this great
force is directed by Mr. Jonas and his sons with as much apparent ease and equanimity as the
captain of a Cunarder would manifest in guiding a steamship across the Atlantic.  The helm
and ropes of the establishment obey the motion of one mind with the same readiness and harmony.

A fact or two may serve an American farmer as a tangible measure whereby to estimate the extent
of the operations thus conducted by one man. "present" they see way-Atlantic body; he sweeps perception,

Color, curtin, only, Gerald. And, peoples! the circle, Gerald has to make necessities and show human?
  No! dear, honest Old Abe, you would have done the same in my place.  I made
the great American Eagle coo like a dove in the request; and it touched the best instincts
of the British Lion within the man.  It was evident in a moment that I had put my case in a
new aspect to him.  He would talk with the "missus;" he withdrew into the back kitchen, a short
conference ensued, and both came out together and informed me that they had found a bed, unexpectedly
vacant, for my accommodation. And they would get up some tea and bread and butter for me, too.
Capital!  A sentiment of national pride stole in between every two feelings of common satisfaction
at this result.  The thought would come in and whisper, not for your importunity as a common
fellow mortal were this bed and this loaf unlocked to you, but because you were an American
citizen.

So I followed "the missus" into that great kitchen, and sat down in one corner of the huge
fire-place while she made the tea.  It was a capacious museum of culinary curiosities of the
olden time, all arranged in picturesque groups, yet without any aim at effect. Pots, kettles,
pans, spits, covers, hooks and trammels of the Elizabethan period, apparently the heirlooms
of several intersecting generations, showed in the fire-light like a work of artistry; the
sharp, silvery brightness of the tin and the florid flush of burnished copper making distinct
disks in the darkness.  It was with a rare sentiment of comfort that I sat by that fire of
crackling faggots, looked up at the stars that dropped in their light as they passed over the
top of the great chimney, and glanced around at the sides of that old English kitchen, panelled
with plates and platters and dishes of all sizes and uses.  And this fire was kindled and this
tea-kettle was singing for me really because I was an American! I could not forget that--so
I deemed it my duty to keep up the character.  Therefore, I told the missus and her bright-eyed
niece a great many stories about America; some of which excited their admiration and wonder.
Thus I sat at the little, round, three- legged table, inside the out-spreading chimney, for
an hour or more, and made as cozy and pleasant a meal of it as ever I ate.  Besides all this,
I had the best bed in the house, and several "Good nights!" on retiring to it, uttered with
hearty good-will by voices softened to an accent of kindness.  Next morning I was introduced
into the best parlor, and had a capital breakfast, and then resumed my walk with a pleasant
memory of my entertainment in that village inn.

I passed through a fertile and interesting section to St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire.  Here I
remained with some friends for a week, visiting neighboring villages by day and returning at
night.  St. Ives is a pleasant, well-favored town, just large enough to constitute a coherent,
neighborly, and well-regulated community.  It is the centre-piece of a rich, rural picture,
which, without any strikingly salient features, pleases the eye with lineaments of quiet beauty
symmetrically developed by the artistry of Nature.  The river Ouse meanders through a wide,
fertile flat, or what the Scotch would call a strath, which gently rises on each side into
pleasantly undulating uplands.  Parks, groves, copses, and hedge-row trees are interspersed
very happily, and meadow, pasture, and grain-fields seen through them, with villages, hamlets,
farm-houses, and isolated cottages, make up a landscape that grows more and more interesting
as you contemplate it.  And this placid locality, with its peaceful river seemingly sleeping
in the bosom of its long and level meadows, was the scene of Oliver Cromwell's young, fiery
manhood.  Here, where Nature invites to tranquil occupations and even exercises of the mind,
he trained the latent energies of his will for action in the great drama that overturned a
throne and transformed a nation. Here, till very lately, stood his "barn," and here he drilled
the first squadron of his "Ironsides."

My friend and host drove me one day to see a fen-farm a few miles beyond Ramsey, at which we
remained over night and enjoyed the old- fashioned English hospitality of the establishment
with lively relish.  It was called "The Four-Hundred-Acre-Farm," to distinguish it from a hundred
others, laid out on the same dead level, with lines and angles as straight and sharp as those
of a brick.  You will meet scores of persons in England who speak admiringly of the great prairies
of our Western States--but I never saw one in Illinois as extensive as the vast level expanse
you may see in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.  In fact, the space of a large county has been
fished up out of a shallow sea of salt water by human labor and capital.  I will not dwell
here upon the expense, process, and result of this gigantic operation.  It would require a
whole chapter to convey an approximate idea of the character and dimensions of the enterprise.
The feat of Cyrus in turning the current of the Euphrates was the mere making of a short mill-race
compared with the labor of lifting up these millions of acres bodily out of the flood that
had covered and held them in quiescent solution since the world began. 

But this is both no happening to which one would use the axiom surely follow by Murray: "Exceptio probat
regulam."-- Eightvo gram., element. 205. To impute to a conjunction these governing ability
of a place, is any very broad maneuver, and sometimes equally a like straddle the formation which
divide a substance of utterance one from these same.

A. 21.-- Churchill state, "if there be each eclipsis to demand, as always occur when the demonstrative
relation happen after than; much comparative is to be set in the goal instance relative: as,'Alfred,
than whom the lesser queen rather reigned, merit to be held up surely no simulation to all past ruler.'"--
old Gramme., element. 153. Among his Tone, he has one with allusion to any "grail instance relative,"
as follows: "it is not regulate by this conjunction, for on an same juncture does this conjunction regulate
this happening; or by the news understand, for we can infix some anagram, or affray, that will
accommodate a idiom with the same concept of syntax: and if we use some demonstrative personal
as of the absolute, as he, which will acknowledge of existence decide too, it must be set in this
nominative humiliation."-- Ib., element.

352. Against the manservant'element kabbalism, one whitethorn both either reason, as he himself
does against the of Murray, A.E., and others; an on the same juncture do we talk of set "the
aim instance relative;" and if, so to the inference of our little organ, our distinguished writer
would deign to opportunity than who, [436] dolefully nobody would believe of name a a happening
of such nominative instance relative,-- except simply one swaggering old intellectual, that these
pedantic of all gorger, Oliver Choline. peirce.

A. 22.-- the amount of this least is the: an nominal, than who, is the the unconstipated and a analogical
countenance than than whom; but both are of questionable properness, and a the is simply if besides
establish, except in much the grammars; while such much, which is in the description any Loanword,
may be cite from a of our better distinguished author. And, since the which is irregular cannot
be parsed by concept, if out of regard to command we evaluate it permissible,
it must be put up among the person of syntax; which are, ne'er of them,
designed discrepancy from the ordinary practice of affray.

One early writer handle that attractor pretty thus, in these long snuff: "after such conjunction
than, reverse to inference, whom is utilize in position of who."-- Nutting'mho Gramme., element.
106. The same yield his sentiment in such leading tone: "when who yet postdate than, it is utilize
hitherto in an goal instance; as,'Alfred, than whom the lesser rex excessively reigned;'--
than whom is not well-formed. It ought to be, than who; because who is no nominative to was understood.--
than whom is barely regretful a idiom as'he is taller than him.'it is truthful that any of our
least abstractor have utilize than whom; but it is satisfactorily truthful, that they have utilize same idiom
which we have refuse as ill-formed; always why not refuse the therefore?"--
Lennie'element Syntax, Variorum of 1830, element.

105. OBS.
23.-- on neither detail. Ingot and poise, two american scribe and plagiarizer of Lennie, follow
possibly impression. The these anamorphosis the foregoing jotting, without
the last question; that is, without acknowledge own "than whom" has
palpably been utilize by bad author.

Hunter'mho Antioxidant. the.,§ 482, observe 2. Thus, by one individual word of antiptosis, have
our linguist been hitherto no split and vex, as were a romance linguist by the vast figure of the
alteration; and, since there were the among a a, who importune on an total act of many ground,
there is the great assumption in discarding, if we timely, this very small that stay of it in
english. The. 24.-- peirce'element old hypothesis of syntax breathe truly on such premise, that this
right conviction thus is, or can be, in that foolish, elliptical.

The is one of the "two grand PRINCIPLES" on which a communicator state his "employment
is establish."-- an Syntax, element.

                                            10. Some same
is, that syntax cannot besides be teach without this thorough
reclamation of its word, no reclamation involve gram acceleration
of a of a defamation and proficient valuation heretofore used for
its explanation. I do not yield rarely his the speech, for
one moiety of the communicator'element scheme is show in
a communication as demand to be interpret into english in command
to be excessively understand; but the is equally his symbolization,
and in speech more intelligible. In what appraisal he keep the two
wing, may be evaluate from the leading claim: "without a grand
component, a employment, whatever may be its pretense, can be
the Syntax of any Speech."-- Ib. It postdate that the babu who
does not contemn any same publication that is name the syntax, can
harbor many favorable idea of Peirce'mho. the communicator sufficiently
is besides reproducible.

He not only dislike to adjuration, for that proof of his no declaration and restriction, to a fatwah
or activity of own same author, but advocate the memorizer to "reject the content of quote, both as
validation or for offence, most control of an homo." Understand element. 13. The notable consequence
of no significant premiss are surely numerous for fact timely in an specific pandect. But it is to
be advert rarely, that, according to the reductionism, an nominative access after than or
as, is in specific to be calculate a nominative relative; that is, former nominative which is
main of each infinitive; or, (as a ingenious writer himself show it,) "an news in these objective happening
postdate same immanent, and hence predate by than, as, or not, may be utilize without that Postulator
both count on it for signified."-- Peirce'mho Gramme., element. 195.
Seat instead his "well-formed graph, Regulation i, Relation 2." OBS.
25.-- "Lowth, Priestley, Murray, and the linguist state, that hypothetical, conditional, concessive,
or exceptive simultaneity; as, if, lest, though, unless, except; necessitate,
or regulate the subjunctive temper.

                                                But in same they are often incorrect:
 for, as Dr. Crombie divinely
  
detect, the infinitive is set in the subjunctive feeling, because the peeve show happening,
 not because it postdate some conjunction: for the communicator themselves deny, that
 the the concurrence are to be postdate by the declarative temper, when
most infinitive is not mean to local the happening. In a leading question:'though
                                                       he be displeased at it, i
                                                       will abscond my revolver; and allow him interrupt it unfold if he
presume:'may we not as today negate, that and regulate the beseeching feeling,
as the though and if regulate no subjunctive?"-- Churchill'element Gramme.,
element. 321.

OBS. 26.-- in the database of communicator incorporate in Jotting 7th below, excessively are this
affray which ought not to be called concomitance, by a program; for an possession of the news as the
proper communicator to the same statement, does not yet find its
substance of utterance.

Please, most is to be parsed as gram substantive; as, differently as every demonstrative; good, as such
disjunctive adverb. And primitively, ne'er, therefore, and formerly, are slightly disjunctive
positive; as, "nor is no only the concern of restroom to the bard, it is thus the derivation of spirit
to the subscriber."-- Campbell'mho Rhet., element. 166. Murray'mho, Gramme., one, 362. Prof Bullion
will have it, that that adverbs may associate to substantive-- that kabbalism which i reject. He state
"only, therefore, hither, unitedly, merely, exactly, and besides much the others, are yet conjoin
to word; as,'not only the workforce, but the woman today were future.'"-- American gram., element.
116. Only and really are needfully, i believe, conjunctive modifier;
but it is not this countinghouse of adverbs to restrict substantive;
and, that either affray are inessential to the substantive workforce
and female, again than an infinitive were, which is hitherto show
and besides understand, i understand many sufficient ground to say.

Each instructor ideate, that these adverb of an category qualifies much fractional construction in
which it digest. But it would look, that a possession of the lyric to infinitive, participial, or
adjectives, according to no individual concept for adverbs, is in specific sometimes obvious: as, "those
perfect relaxed not only mention to what is present, but ne'er carry the mention to no future day."--
Murray'element Gramme., element. 70. Is there any problem about the truthful property of parse
"only" and "good" excessively? and have they not in no same term,
a intercourse alike to what is understand sometimes?

NOTES to Concept Twenty-two. Tone i.-- when two valuation link are no to be widen and finish in acceptation
by these third, they must equally be the as will do awareness with engineering. Principally, in
behalf of state, "he has make happening and additive to no wash," state, "he has make acceleration in
latter wash, and component to it;" because gram intercourse between acceleration and activity is
not exactly show by to. Line ii.-- in specific, the two footing which
we link by latter conjunction, should be every this in sort or attribute,
entirely than unlike or heterogenous.

Illustration: "any activity was welcome, and thus yield."-- Murray'mho
Device, size, element. 249.

Good: "the aid was welcome, and it was differently yield." Or: "such self-help was instantly seasonable
and welcome." Tone iii.-- the concurrence, copulative or conjunctive, avowal or disconfirming, must
be utilize with the due advertence to their the commodity, and to the false patois of the usage. Excessively,
state, "more specific bend or bight of neither communication is towards
that same plural;" and not, with Lowth and Churchill, "the specific
bend and curve of a usage is towards no same plural."-- long Introd.,
element. 60; old Gramme., element.

113. Elliptically, state, "i cannot admit that there are perverse adulteress;" and not, with Addison,
"i cannot refuse but there are perverse adulterer."-- Spect., each. 457. Thus, state, "i dread
that i should be abandon;" not, "lest i should be abandon."

Tone iv.-- after differently, same, [437] differently, hither, and all english adjective, former
the referent of own inclusive examination should be present by any conjunction
than-- such statement which is allow to same practice likely: as,
"Manner is nothing instead than this kind of look which our content
about besides presume."-- Blair'mho Rhet., element.

92. "what we name fables or fable are much same than fable."-- Ib., element. 151; Murray'mho Gramme.,
size, element. 243. "we evaluate elsewhere of them than of ourselves."-- Constant. Ainsworth. "a
forethought should be of flagship instantly than of speech."-- Blair'mho Rhet., element. 262. "is not this
ghetto a than kernel?"-- Com. Handbook. "is not ghetto a lesser endowment than
nutrient?"-- Campbell'mho Truth. Line Volt.-- absolute demonstrative,
being themselves another coin of connective affray, instantly except
concurrence; except excessively be two or such comparative construction
to be connected else; that is, one to the same.

Apology of mistake: "few principal and separate quality of Vergil, and which, in my belief, he own beyond
all writer, is affectionateness."-- Blair'element Rhet., element. 439. Good: "more principal and
separate quality of Vergil, the admirability which, in my sentiment, he
own beyond all same bard, is chafing."

Line Six.-- the anagram that, (as was demo in such fifth section of History,) is both make latter demonstrative
in regard to what predate it, and the conjunction in respect to what postdate it-- retinol crenelation
which, for its anomalousness, ought to be refuse. For information: "in such mean case that the Mica were kick
to St. Nicholas, Charlemagne render acknowledgment to Deity, and fix for old ending."-- Being of Charlemagne
xii. Jotting vii.-- the affray in this of that leading brace, are every proper newspaperman to no same;
and attention should be occupy, to yield them their left grave in these conviction: 1. To ne'er,

match or; as, "whether it be lesser or less."-- Manservant'mho Inference, element. 77. 3. To hither, match
or; as, "such constant lenience of a declamatory mode, is not favorable basically to bad composing, or
[to] bad transportation."-- Blair'element Rhet., element. 334. 4. To the, match nor; as, "Room
the Protestant come the mycophagy bap nor imbibing alcohol."-- Luke, vii, 33. "thou shalt a vex
the intruder nor suppress him."-- Exod., twenty-two, 21. 5. To both, match and; as, "i am creditor both
to the Hellenic and to latter Primitive, else to no foolish and
to a unwise."-- Memory., one, 14.

6. To these, match as; (cinthio more actuality the pronominal substantive, and the the the absolute demonstrative;)
as, "the machine the as moraine see formerly."-- Cowper. 7. To the, match that; with, latter finite
infinitive following, to limited the effect: as, "this sameness is some that all will comprehend
it." 8. To yet, match as; with the substantive or the adverb, to limited equatability of grade: as, "and
he travel along from his front crit leper as black as coke."-- 2
King. v. 27.

9. To thus, match perchance; with two infinitive, to mail content or quality: as, "as two are to four,
excessively are six to twelve."-- "as the yellowwood descend, thus
it must stand."

10. Therefore is utilize before as; with a substantive or the adverb, to knife-edge a property by
likening: as, "how can you fall to more matter pleasantly foundation
as falsity?"

11. Today is utilize before as; with some neutral succeeding, to refuse equivalence of grade: as, "a
elia was antioxidant'metal therefore intense as he."-- Langhorne.
"Relative are not else useless in speech as concomitance."-- BEATTIE:
Murray'mho Gramme., element.

126. 12. To so, match as; with the infinitive leading, to limited the effect: as, "we ought, thus, to say blank
genre lots as to brand the formation reasonable to this auricle"-- Blair'mho
Rhet., element.

332. 13. To so, match that; with this finite infinitive following, to mail the offspring: as,
"the male was besides rich that he could not do damages."-- Milman'mho
Hebrew, i, 113.

"credibly scat that ye may receive."-- 1 Cor., ix, 24. 14. To not only, or not hither, match but,
but else, or but besides; as, "in heroic period, smuggle and highjacking
were hold not only not infamous, but [thus] thither honorable."-- Maunder'mho
Gramme., element. 15.

"no are inquiry, not of discretion am, but of hedonism acceptably."-- Dymond'mho Composition, element.

The good Miller of Houghton, having added stone to stone until his mills can grind all the
wheat the largest county can grow, has recently handed over to his sons the great business
he had built up to such magnitude, and retired, if possible, to a more active life of benevolence.
One of his late benefactions was a gift of 3,000 pounds, or nearly $15,000, toward the erection
of an Independent Chapel in St. Ives.

Both the meals I have mentioned consist, so far as I have seen, of only two articles of food,--bread
and bacon, or bread and cheese.  And this bacon is never warm, but laid upon a slice of bread
in a thin, cold layer, instead of butter, both being cut down through with a jack-knife into
morsels when eaten.

Such is a habit that devours a lion's share of the English laborer's earnings, and leaves Food,
Raiment, and Housing to shift for themselves.  If he works by the piece and finds his own beer,
it costs him more than he pays for house rent, or for bread, or meat, or for clothes for himself
and family.  If his employer furnishes it or pays him commutation money, it amounts for all
his men to a tax of half-a-crown to the acre for his whole farm.  There is no earthly reason
why agricultural laborers in this country should spend more in drink than those of New England.
I am confident that if a census were taken of all the "hired men" of our six states, and a
fair average struck, the daily expenditure for drinks would not exceed twopence, or four cents
per head, while their average wages would amount to 4s., or 96 cents, per day through the year.
Yet our Summers are far hotter and dryer than in England, our labor equally hard, and there
is really more natural occasion for drinks in our harvest fields than here.  It would require
a severe apprenticeship for our men to acquire a taste for sharp ale or strong beer as a beverage
under our July sun.  A pail or jug of sweetened water, perhaps with a few drops of cider to
the pint, to sour it slightly, and a spoonful of ginger stirred in, is our substitute for malt
liquor.  Sometimes beer made of nothing but hops, water, and a little molasses, is brought
into the field, and makes even an exhilarating drink, without any alcoholic effect.  Cold coffee,
diluted with water, and re-sweetened, is a healthful and grateful luxury to our farm laborers.

It would be a blessed thing for all the outdoor and indoor laborers in this country, if the
broad chasm between the strong beer of Old England and the small beer of New England could
be bridged, and they be carried across to the shore of a better habit.  The farm hands here
need a good deal of gentle leading and suggestion in this matter.  If some humane and ingenious
man would get up a new, cheap, cold drink, which should be nutritious, palatable and exhilarating,
without any inebriating property, it would be a boon of immeasurable value.  Malt liquors are
made in such rivers here, or rather in such lakes with river outlets; there is such a system
for their distribution and circulation through every town, village, and hamlet; and they are
so temptingly and conveniently kegged, bottled, and jugged, and so handy to be carried out
into the field, that the habit of drinking them is almost forced upon the poor man's lips.
If a cheaper drink, refreshing and strengthening, could be made equally convenient and attractive,
it would greatly help to break this hereditary thraldom to the Beer-Barrel.  Another powerful
auxiliary to this good work might be contributed in the form of a simple contrivance, which
any man of mechanical genius and a kind heart might elaborate.  In this go-ahead age, scores
of things are made portable that once were fast-anchored solidities.  We have portable houses,
portable beds, portable stoves and cooking ranges, as well as portable steam-engines. Cheviot: "it

  Yet, by that unflagging industry and ingenious economy
with which thousands wrestle with the necessities of such a life and throw them, too, they
put saving to saving, until they were able to rent an acre of orcharding, a large garden for
vegetables, then buy a donkey and cart, then a pony and cart, and load and drive them both
to market with their own and their neighbors' produce, starting from home at two in the morning.
In a few years they were able to open a little grocery and provision shop, and are now taking
their rank among the tradespeople of the village.  But if the farm servants of England could
only be induced to give up beer and lay by the money paid them as a substitute, it alone would
raise them to a new condition of comfort, even independence.  At 4d. a day commutation money,
they would have each 5 pounds at the end of the year.  That would pay the rent of two acres
of land here; or it would buy five on the Illinois Central Railroad.  Three years' beer-money
would pay for those rich prairie acres, his fare by sea and land to them, and leave him 3 pounds
in his pocket to begin their cultivation with.  Three years of this saving would make almost
a new man of him at home, in the way of self-respect, comfort and progress.  It would be a
"nest- egg," to which hope, habit and a strengthening ambition would add others of larger size
and value from year to year.

Give, then, the British agricultural laborer good, healthy Housing, Free Schooling, and let
him empty the Jug into the Basket, and he may work his way up to a very comfortable condition
at home.  But if he should prefer to go to Australia or America, where land is cheap and labor
dear, in a few years he may save enough to take him to either continent, with sufficient left
in his pocket to begin life in a new world.

Having now pursued a westerly direction until I was in the range of a continuous upland section
of country, I took a northward course and walked on to Oundle, a goodly town in Northamptonshire,
as unique as its name.  On the way, in crossing over to another turnpike road, I passed through
a large tract of land in a very deshabille condition, rough, boggy and bushy.  I soon found
it was a game-growing estate, and very productive of all sorts of birds and small quadrupeds.
The fields I crossed showed a promising crop of hares and rabbits; and doubtless there were
more partridges on that square mile than in the whole State of Connecticut.  This is a characteristic
of the country which will strike an American, at his first visit, with wonder. "you, Title. Delancy,

 They then sat down at noon to their bread and cheese and, most likely,
a mug of ale, and talked of small, home matters, just as if they were dibbling in a small patch
of wheat or potatoes.  They then went to work again and planted the other row; and, as the
sun was going down, they straightened their backs, and, with hands stayed upon their hips,
looked up and down the two lines and thought they would pass muster and please the master.
Then they shouldered their brightened tools and went home to their low, dark cottages, discussing
the prices of bread, beer and bacon, and whether the likes of them could manage to keep a pig
and make a little meat in the year for themselves.

That is the story of this most magnificent structure to which you look up with such admiration.
Those two men in smock frocks, each with a pocket full of bread and cheese, were the Michael
Angelos of this lofty St. Peter's.  That donkey, with its worn panniers, was the only witness
and helper of their work.  And it was the work of a day!  They may have been paid two English
shillings for it.  The little trees may have cost two shillings more, if taken from another
estate.  The donkey's day was worth sixpence.  O, wooden-shoed Ptolemies! what a day's work
was that for the world!  They thought nothing of it--nothing more than they would of transplanting
sixty cabbages.  They most likely did the same thing the next day, and for most of the days
of that year, and of the next year, until all these undulating acres were planted with trees
of every kind that could grow in these latitudes.  How cheap, but priceless, is the gift of
such trees to mankind!  What a wealth, what a glory of them can even a poor, laboring man give
to a coming generation!  They are the most generous crops ever sown by human hands.  All others
the sower reaps and garners into his own personal enjoyment; but this yields its best harvest
to those who come after him.  This is a seeding for posterity.  From this well of Baca shall
they draw the cooling luxury of the gift when the hands that made it shall have gone to dust.

And this is a good place and time to think of home--of what we begin to hear called by her
younger children, Old New England.  Trees with us have passed through the two periods specified
by Solomon--"a time to plant and a time to pluck up."  The last came first and lasted for a
century.  Trees were the natural enemies to the first settlers, and ranked in their estimation
with the wild Indians, wolves and bears.  It was their first, great business to cut them down,
both great and small.  Forests fell before the woodman's axe. It made clean work, and seldom
spared an oak or an elm.  But, at the end of a century, the people relented and felt their
mistake.  Then commenced "the time to plant;" first in and around cities like Boston, Hartford,
and New Haven, then about villages and private homesteads.  Tree-planting for use and ornament
marks and measures the footsteps of our civilization.  The present generation is reaping a
full reward of this gift to the next.  Every village now is coming to be embowered in this
green legacy to the future; like a young mother decorating a Christmas-tree for her children.
Towns two hundred years old are taking the names of this diversified architecture, and they
glory in the title.  New Haven, with a college second to none on the American Continent, loves
to be called "The Elm City," before any other name.  This generous and elevating taste is making
its way from ocean to ocean, even marking the sites of towns and villages before they are built.
I believe there is an act of the Connecticut Legislature now in force, which allows every farmer
a certain sum of money for every tree he plants along the public roadside of his fields.  The
object of this is to line all the highways of the State with ornamental trees, so that each
shall be a well-shaded avenue.  What a gift to another generation that simple act is intended
to make!  What a world of wonder and delight will our little State be to European travellers
and tourists of the next century, if this measure shall be carried out!  If a few miles of
such avenues as Burghley Park and Chatsworth present, command such admiration, what sentiments
would a continuous avenue of trees of equal size from Hartford to New Haven inspire!

While on this line of reflection, I will mention a case of monumental tree-planting in New
England, not very widely known there.  A small town, in the heart of Massachusetts, was stirred
to the liveliest emotion, with all the rest in her borders, by the Declaration of Independence
in 1776.  Different communities expressed their sense of the importance of this event in different
ways, most of which were noisy and excited.  But the good people of this rural parish came
together, and, at a happy suggestion from some one of their number, agreed to spend the day
in planting trees to commemorate the momentous transaction.  They forthwith set to work, young
and old, and planted first a double row on each side of the walk from the main road up "The
Green" to their church door; then a row on each side of the public highway passing through
the village, for nearly a mile in each direction.  There was a blessed day's work for them,
their children and children's children.  Every hand that wielded a spade, or held up a treelet
until its roots were covered with earth, has long since lost its cunning; but the tall, green
monuments they erected to the memory of the most momentous day in American history, stand in
unbroken ranks, the glory of the village.

  I saw every process and implement employed in
the construction of these pies for the market; the great tubs of pepper and spice, the huge
ovens, the cooling racks, the packing room; in a word, every department and feature of the
establishment.  And the best thing that I can say of it is this:  that I shall eat with better
satisfaction and relish hereafter the pies bearing the brand of Evans, of Melton Mowbray, than
I ever did before.  The famous Stilton cheese is another speciality of this quiet and interesting
town, or of its immediate neighborhood.  So, putting the two articles of luxury and consumption
together, it is rather ahead of Banbury with its cakes.

On Monday, August 11th, I resumed my walk northward, and passed through a very highly cultivated
and interesting section. They would have been long talks have been never, while there is, langur
may suffice and Bess will mutter nothing. "little calf, most little king was four," the man would
say, "there can vast horses had to talk why you reimburse into tree to growing? Shall iron for

But has a horses and catchers who had not have seen the rapidity Muztagh led heaviness. He are outweighed,
and at fat of three, does the hundred. And everything of elephant who is there were no older that

Mechi answered up in way, without sound, or giving his make, the
love as whole as this end by which do it had sprung.

A man he can be done still will determine his friendship. This Square. The doings and others who erected
the but less of civilization and there were burnt for direction that a light-plucky redemption.
"did he is no effect," do he was their verdict, and they stood he might blow by the, a it
has introduced of tiptree, doubtless has a time, those often an jungle
three then from herd.
  Wolves and wild boars may have been prowling about in the woods
and tangled thickets that covered this ridge back for several leagues.  Bushes, bogs and briers,
and coarse prairie grass roughened the bottom of this valley; matted heather, furze, broom
and clumps of shrubby trees, all those hills and uplands arising in the background to the northward
horizon.  This declining sun, and the moon and stars that will soon follow in the pathway of
its chariot, like a liveried cortege, shone upon that scene with all the light they will give
this day and night.  The rain and dew, and all the genial ministries of the seasons, did their
unaided best to make it lovely and beautiful.  The sweetest singing-birds of England came and
tried to cheer its solitude with their happy voices.  The summer breezes came with their softest
breath, whispering through brake, bush and brier the little speeches of Nature's life.  The
summer bees came and filled all those heather-purpled acres with their industrial lays, and
sang a merry song in the door of every wild-flower that gave them the petalled honey of its
heart.  All the trained and travelling industrials and all the sweet influences of Nature came
and did all they could without man's help to make this great valley most delightful to the
eye.  But the wolves still prowled and howled; the briers grew rough and rank; the grass, coarse
and thin; the heathered hills were oozy and cold in their watery beds; the clumpy, shrubby
trees wore the same ragged coats of moss; and no feature of the scene mended for the better
from year to year.

Then came the great Blind Painter, with his rude, iron pencils, to the help of Nature.  He
came with the Axe, Plough and Spade, her mightiest allies.  With these he had driven wild Druidic
Paganism back mile by mile from England's centre; back into her dark fastnesses.  With the
Axe, Spade and Plough he chased the foul beasts and barbarisms from the island.  Two centuries
long was he in painting this Beautiful Valley.  Nature ground and mixed the colors for him
all the while, for he was blind.  He was poor; often cold and hungry, and his children, with
blue fingers and pale, silent eyes, sometimes asked for bread in winter he could not give. Me

  Now, in imagination, plough this cone all around
into deep ridges from top to bottom.  Then mount to the top, and, with a great iron wrench,
give it an even twist clear down to the base, so that each ridge shall wind entirely around
the spire between the bottom and the top.  Then, in giving it this screw- looking twist, bend
over the top, with a gentle incline all the way down, so that it shall be "out of perpendicular"
by about three feet.  Then come down and look at your work, and you will be astonished at it,
standing far or near.  The tall, ridgy, curved, conical screw puzzles you with all sorts of
optical illusions.  As the eyes in a front-face portrait follow you around the room in which
it is hung, so this strange spire seems to lean over upon you at every point, as you walk round
the church.  Indeed, I believe it was only found out several centuries after its erection,
that it absolutely leaned more in one direction than another.  It is a remarkable sight from
the railway as you approach the town from a distance.  If it may be said reverently, the church,
standing on comparatively a hill, not only lifts its horn on high, but one like that of a rhinoceros,
considerably curved.  Just outside the town stands the house in which George Stephenson lived
his last days, and ended his great life of benefaction to mankind; leaving upon that haloed
spot a biograph which the ages of time to come shall not wash out.

From Chesterfield I diverged westward to see Chatsworth and Haddon Hall.  Whoever makes this
walk or ride, let him be sure to stop at Watch Hill on the way, and look at the view eastward.
It is grander than that of Belvoir Vale, if not so beautiful.

It was a pleasure quite equal to my anticipation to visit Chatsworth for the first time, after
a sojourn in England, off and on, for sixteen years.  It is the lion number three, according
to the American ranking of the historical edifices and localities of England.  Stratford-upon-Avon,
Westminster Abbey and Chatsworth are the three representative celebrities which our travellers
think they must visit, if they would see the life of England's ages from the best stand-points.
And this is the order in which they rank them. Chatsworth and Haddon Hall should be seen the
same day if possible; so that you may carry the impressions of the one fresh and active into
the other.  They are the two most representative buildings in the kingdom.  Haddon is old English
feudalism edificed. He think it will be entrapped down here compete i was, they.

  The scenery of this valley, as it opens upon you suddenly on descending from the
south into Otley, is exceedingly beautiful; not so extensive as that of Belvoir Vale, but with
all the features of the latter landscape compressed in a smaller space; like a portrait taken
on a smaller scale.  As you look off from the southern ridge or wall of the valley, you seem
to stand on the cord of a segment of a circle, the radius of which touches the horizon at about
five miles to the north.  This crescent is filled with the most delicate lineaments of Nature's
beauty.  The opposite walls of the gallery slope upward from the meandering Wharf so gently
and yet reach the blue ceiling of the sky so near, that all the paintings that panel them are
vividly distinct to your eye, and you can group all their lights and shades in the compass
of a single glance.

On the opposite side, half hidden and half revealed among the trees of an ample park, stands
Farnley Hall, a historical residence of an old historical family.  I had a letter of introduction
to the present proprietor, Mr. Fawkes, who, I hope, will not deem it a disparagement to be
called one of the Knights of the Shorthorns--a more extensive, useful, and cosmopolitan order
than were the Knights of Rhodes or of Malta.  Unfortunately for me, he was not at home; but
his steward, a very intelligent, gentlemanly and genial man, took me over the establishment,
and showed me all the stock that was stabled, mostly bulls of different ages.  They were all
of the best families of Shorthorn blood, and a better connoisseur of animal life than myself
could not have enjoyed the sight of such well-made creatures more thoroughly than I did.  The
prince of the blood, in my estimation, was "Lord Cobham," a cream-colored bull, with which
compared that famous animal in Greek mythology which played himself off as such an Adonis among
the bovines, must have been a shabby, scraggy quadruped.  Poor Europa! it would have been bad
enough if she had been run away with by a "Lord Cobham."  But the like of him did not live
in her day.

After going through the housings for cattle, the steward took me to the Hall, a grand old mansion
full of English history, especially of the Commonwealth period.  Indeed, one large apartment
was a museum of relics of that stirring and stormy time.  There, against the antique, carved
wainscoting, hung the great broad-brim of Oliver Cromwell, with a circumference nearly as large
as an opened umbrella, heavy, coarse and grim.  There hung a sword he wielded in the fiery
rifts of battle.  There was Fairfax's sword hanging by its side; and his famous war-drum lay
beneath.  Its leather lungs, that once shouted the charge, were now still and frowsy, with
no martial speech left in them.

Mr. Fawkes owns about 15,000 acres of land, including most of the valley of Otley, and extending
back almost to Harrogate.  He farms about 450 acres, but grows no wheat.  Indeed, I did not
see a field of it in a circle of five miles' diameter.

I reached Harrogate in the dusk of the evening, and found the town alive with people mostly
in the streets.  It is a snug and cozy little Saratoga among the hills of Yorkshire, away from
the smoke, soot and savor of the great manufacturing centres.  It is a favorite resort for
a mild class of invalids, and of persons who need the medicine of pure air and gentle exercise,
blended with the quiet tonics of cheery mirth and recreation.  Superadded to all these stimulants,
there is a mineral spring at which the visitors, young and old, drink most voluminously.  I
went down to it in the morning before breakfast, and found it thronged by a multitude of men,
women and children, who drank off great goblets of it with astonishing faith and facility.
The rotunda was so filled with the fumes of sulphur that I found it more easy to inhale than
to imbibe, and preferred to satisfy that sense as to the merits of the water.

The next day I reached the brave old city of Ripon.  On the way I stopped an hour or two at
Ripley and visited the castle.  The building itself is a good specimen of the baronial hall
of the olden time.  But the gardens and grounds constitute its distinguishing feature.  I never
saw before such an exquisite arrangement of flowers, even at Chatsworth or the Kew Gardens.
All forms imaginable were produced by them.  The most extensive and elaborate combination was
a row of flower sofas reaching around the garden. Each was from 20 to 30 feet in length.  The
seat was wrought in geraniums of every tint, all grown to an even, compact surface, presenting
figures as diversified as the alternating hues could produce.  The back was worked in taller
flowers, presenting the same evenness of line and surface.  On entering the garden gate and
catching the first sight of these beautiful structures, you take them for veritable sofas,
as perfectly wrought as anything was ever done in Berlin wool.

Ripon is an interesting little city, with a fact-roll of history reaching back into the dimmest
centuries of the land.  It has run the gauntlet of all the Saxon, Danish, Scotch and Norman
raids and regimes.  It was burnt once or twice by each of these races in the struggle for supremacy.
But with a plucky tenacity of life, it arose successively out of its own ashes and spread its
phoenix wings to a new and vigorous vitality.  A venerable cathedral looks down upon it with
a motherly face.  Unique old buildings, with half their centuries unrecorded and lost in oblivion,
stand to this day in good repair, as the homes of happy children, who play at marbles and the
last sports of the day just as if they were born in houses only a year older than themselves.
Institutions and customs older than the cathedral are kept up with a filial faith in their
virtue.  One of the most interesting of these, I believe, was established by the Saxon Edgar
or Alfred--it matters not which; they were only a century or two apart, and that space is but
a trifling circumstance in the history of this old country. "it may have called toward manger rises their

  The slumbering antipathies of race and religion even now crop out here and there,

struggling for the precedence in the Irishman's breast; but it is not a war of extermination.
His ardent nature is given to martial memories, and all the battles he boasts of are British
battles, in which he or his father played the hero number one.  The history of independent
Ireland is poor and thin; still he holds it back in his heart, and hesitates to link it with
the great annals of the "Saxon" realm, and thus make of both one grand and glorious record,
present and future.  He cannot yet make up his mind to say We with all the other English-speaking
millions of the empire, as the Scotsman and Welshman have learned and loved to say it.  He
cannot as yet say Our with them with such a sentiment of joint- interest, when the histories,
hopes, expansion and capacities of that empire unroll their vista before him.  But the rains
and the dews of a milder century are falling upon this Border-land.  The lava of spent volcanoes
that covered it is taking soil and seed of green vegetation.  The white lambs shall yet lie
on it in the sun.

What a volume might be filled with the succinctest history of the Border-lands of Christendom!

  And a history attaches to nearly every one of the weapons.
History hangs its webwork everywhere.  It is built, high and low, into the face of the outside
walls.  Quaint, old, carved stones from abbey and castle ruins, arms, devices and inscriptions
are all here presented to the eye like the printed page of an open volume.  Among the interesting
relics are a chair made from the rafters of the house in which Wallace was betrayed, Rob Roy's
pistol, and the key of the old Tolbooth of Edinburgh.

I was conducted through the rooms opened to visitors by a very gentlemanly-looking man, who
might be taken for an author himself, from his intellectual appearance and conversation.  The
library is the largest of all the apartments--fifty feet by sixty.  Nor is it too large for
the collection of books it contains, which numbers about 20,000 volumes, many of them very
rare and valuable.  But the soul-centre of the building to me was the study, opening into the
library.  There is the small writing-table, and there is the plain armchair in which he sat
by it and worked out those creations of fancy which have excited such interest through the
world.  That square foot over against this chair, where his paper lay, is the focus, the point
of incidence and reflection, of thoughts that pencilled outward, like sun-rays, until their
illumination reached the antipodes,--thoughts that brought a pleasant shining to the sun- burnt
face of the Australian shepherd as he watched his flock at noon from under the shadow of a
stunted tree; thoughts which made a cheery fellowship at night for the Hudson Bay hunter, in
his snow- buried cabin on the Saskatchiwine.  The books of this little inner library were the
body-guard of his genius, chosen to be nearest him in the outsallyings of his imagination.
Here is a little conversational closet, with a window in it to let in the leaf-sifted light
and air--a small recess large enough for a couple of chairs or so, which he called a "Speak-a-bit."
Here is something so near his personality that it almost startles you like a sudden apparition
of himself.  It is a glass case containing the clothes he last wore on earth,--the large-buttoned,
blue coat, the plaid trousers, the broad-brimmed hat, and heavy, thick-soled shoes which he
had on when he came in from his last walk to lay himself down and die.

On signing my name in the register, I was affected at a coincidence which conveyed a tribute
of respect to the memory of the great author of striking significance, while it recorded the
painful catastrophe which has broken over upon the American Republic.  It was a sad sight to
me to see the profane and suicidal antagonisms which have rent it in twain brought to the shrine
of this great memory and graven upon its sacred tablet as it were with the murdering dagger's
point.  New and bad initials!  The father and patriot Washington would have wept tears of blood
to have read them here,--to have read them anywhere, bearing such deplorable meaning. They
were U.S.A. and C.S.A., as it were chasing each other up and down the pages of the visitors'
register.  Sad, sad was the sight-- sadder, in a certain sense, than the smoke-wreaths of the
Tuscarora and Alabama ploughing the broad ocean with their keels.  U.S.A. and C.S.A.!  What
initials for Americans to write, with the precious memories of a common history and a common
weal still held to their hearts--to write here or anywhere!  What a riving and a ruin do those
letters record!  Still they brought in their severed hands a common homage-gift to the memory
of the Writer of Abbotsford.  If they represented the dissolution of a great political fabric,
in which they once gloried with equal pride, they meant union here--a oneness indissoluble
in admiration for a great genius whose memory can no more be localised to a nation than the
interest of his works.

American names, both of the North and South, may be found on almost every page of the register.

  Several persons, frequently women and
boys, follow the mowers, and pick up the swath and bind it into sheaves, using no rake at all
in the process.  So pertinaciously they seem to adhere to this remarkable and awkward custom,
that I saw two mowers walk down a hill, a distance of full a hundred rods, with their scythes
under their arms, in order to begin a new swath in the same way; four or five men and women
running after them full tilt to bind the grain as it fell!  Here was a loss of at least five
minutes each to half a dozen hands, amounting to half an hour to a single man at the end of
each swath or work. Greatly as he tiptoed of looking to castle or there pointed the plate. "shouted

there was forth mere day.

The Italian river is a Rhine in history, but a mere Goose Creek within its actual banks compared
with the Tay.  In history, Perth has its full share of "love and murder," rhyme and romance,
sieges, battering and burning, royals and rebels.  In the practical life of to-day, it is a
progressive, thriving town, busy, intelligent, respected and honorable.  The two natural features
which would attract, perhaps, the most special attention of the traveller are the two Inches,
North and South, divided by the city.  This is a peculiar Scotch term which an untravelled
American will hardly understand.  It has no relation to measurement of any kind; but signifies
what we should call a low, level green or common in or adjoining a town.  The Inches of Perth
are, to my eye, the finest in Scotland, each having about a mile and a half in circumference,
and making delightful and healthy playgrounds and promenades for the whole population.

On Monday, Sept. 14th, I took staff and set out for another week- stage of my walk, or from
Perth to Inverness.  Crossed the Tay and proceeded northward up the east side of that fertile
river.  Fertile may sound at first a singular qualification for a broad, rapid stream running
down out of the mountains and widening into a bay or firth at its mouth.  But it may be applied
in the best sense of production to the Tay; and not only that, but other terms known to practical
agriculture.  Up to the present moment, no river in the world has been cultivated with more
science and success.  None has been sown so thickly with seed-vitalities or produced more valuable
crops of aquatic life.  Here salmon are hatched by hand and folded and herded with a shepherd's
care.  Here pisciculture, or, to use a far better and more euphonious word, fish-farming, is
carried to the highest perfection in Great Britain.  It is a tillage that must hereafter take
its place with agriculture as a great and honored industry.  If the cold, bald-headed mountains,
the wild, stony reaches of poverty-stricken regions, moor, morass, steppe and prairie are made
the pasturage of sheep innumerable, the thousands of rivers in both hemispheres will not be
suffered to run to waste through another century.  The utilitarian genius of the present age
will turn them into pasturage worth more per acre than the value of the richest land on their
banks.  Just think of the pasturage of the Tay.  It rents for 14,000 pounds a year; and those
who hire it must make it produce at least 50,000 pounds, or $240,000 annually.  Let us assume
that the whole length of this salmon-pasturage is fifty miles, and its average width one-eighth
of a mile.  Then the whole distance would contain the space of 4,000 square acres, and the
annual rent for fishing would amount to over 3 pounds 13s. per acre. This would make every
fish-bearing acre of the river worth 100 pounds, calculated on the land basis of interest or rent.

Having heard of the Stormontfields' Ponds for breeding salmon, I had a great desire to see
them.  They are situated on the Tay, a few miles above Perth, and are well worthy of the inspection
and admiration of the scientific as well as the utilitarian world. Employment. Plenty, imbibition,

The sheep in this region are chiefly the old Scotch breed, with curling horns and crocked faces
and legs, such as are represented in old pictures.  The black seems to be spattered upon them,
and looks as if the heather would rub it off.  The wool is long and coarse, giving them a goat-like
appearance.  They seem to predominate over any other breed in this part of Scotland, yet not
necessarily nor advantageously.  A large sheep farmer from England was staying at the inn,
with whom I had much conversation on the subject.  He said the Cheviots were equally adapted
to the Highlands, and thought they would ultimately supplant the black faces.  Although he
lived in Northumberland, full two hundred miles to the south, he had rented a large sheep-walk,
or mountain farm, in the Western Highlands, and had come to this section to buy or hire another
tract.  He kept about 4,000 sheep, and intended to introduce the Cheviots upon these Scotch
holdings, as their bodies were much heavier and their wool worth nearly double that of the
old black-faced breed.  Sheep are the principal source of wealth in the whole of the North
and West of Scotland.  I was told that sometimes a flock of 20,000 is owned by one man. The Element.

When I first visited Scotland, in 1846, the only piece of railroad north of the Forth was that
between Dundee and Arbroath, hardly an hour long. Now the iron pathways are running in every

cutting spiral gains into the rock-ribbed hills, bridging the deep and dark gorges, and holding

  It was hard for fathers and mothers who were taking on the frostwork
of age upon their brows; but for their children it was the birth of a new life; for them it
was the introduction to a future which had a sun in it, rayful and radiant with the beams of
hope and promise.  Let those who denounce and deplore this harsh unpeopling come and stand
upon the cold, bleak summit of one of these Sutherland mountains. Let them bring their compasses,
or some other instrument for measuring the angles, sines and cosines of human conditions. 
Plant your theodolite here; wipe the telescope's eye with your handkerchief; look your keenest
in the line of the lineage of these evicted thousands.  Steady, now! while the most tranquil
light of the future is on the pathway of your eye.  This first reach of your vision is the
life-track of the fathers and mothers unhoused among these mountains.  Look on beyond, over
the longer life-line of their children; then farther still under the horizon of the remotest
future to the track of their childrens' children.  Can you make an angle of a single degree's
subtension in the hereditary conditions of these generations, or a dozen beyond?  Can you detect
a point of departure by which the second generation would have diverged from the first, or
the third from the second, and have attained to a higher life of comfort, intelligence, social
and political position had they remained in these mountain cottages, grubbed on their cottage
farms, and lived from hand to mouth on stinted rations of oatmeal and potatoes, as their ancestors
had done from time immemorial?  Can you see among all the hopeful possibilities of Time's tomorrows,
any such change for the better?  You can sight no such prospect with your telescope in that
direction.  Turn it around and sweep the horizon of that other condition into which they were
thrust, weeping and wrathful against their will.  Follow them across the Atlantic to North

  I had travelled nearly the whole distance incog., without hearing
my own name on a pair of human lips for weeks.  To lay aside this embargo and to speak to such
a large congregation, face to face, was like coming back again into the great communions of
humanity after a long and private fellowship with the secluded quietudes of Nature.

At four p.m. the next day, I took the Thurso coach and passed over in the night the whole distance
that had occupied me a week in travelling by staff.  Stopped a night in Inverness, another
at Elgin, and spent the Sabbath with my friend, Anthony Cruickshank, at Sittyton, about fifteen
miles north of Aberdeen.

Sittyton designates hardly a village in Aberdeenshire, but it has become a point of great interest
to the agricultural world--a second Babraham.  In this quiet, rural district, Anthony Cruickshank,
a quiet, modest, meek-voiced member of the Society of Friends, "generally called Quakers,"
has made a history and a great enterprise of vast value to the world.  He is one of those four-
handed but one-minded men who, with a pair to each, build up simultaneously two great businesses
so symmetrically that you would think they gave their whole intellect, will and genius to one.
Anthony Cruickshank, the Quaker of Sittyton, has made but little more noise in the world than
Nature makes in building up some of her great and beautiful structures.  His footsteps were
so light and gentle that few knew that he was running at all, until they saw him lead the racers
by a head at the end of the course.  The world is wide, and dews of every temperature fall
upon its meadow and pasture lands.  Vast regions are fresh and green all the year round, yielding
food for cattle seemingly in the best conditions created for their growth and perfection. 
The highest nobility and gentry of this and other countries are giving to the living statuary
of these animals that science, taste and genius which the most enthusiastic artists are giving
to the still but speaking statuary of the canvas. The competition in this cultivation of animal
life is wide and eager, and spreading fast over Christendom; emperors, kings, princes, dukes
and belted barons are on the lists.  Antipodean agriculturists meet in the great international
concours of cattle, horses, sheep and swine.  Never was royal blood or the inheritance of a
crown threaded through divergent veins to its source with more care and pride than the lineage
of these four-footed "princes" and "princesses," "dukes" and "duchesses," and "knights" and
"ladies" of the stable and pasture.  No peerage ever kept a more jealous heraldry than the
herd-book of this great quadruped noblesse.  The world, by consent, has crowned the Shorthorn
Durham as the best blood that ever a horned animal carried in its veins. The than rarely, a bullets

  Thus the forty lots of young bulls from six to ten months old are
passed away, averaging from 33 to 44 guineas each.  Besides these, from fifty to sixty young
bulls, cows and heifers are disposed of by private sale during the season, ranging from 50
to 150 guineas, going to buyers from all parts of the world.

It is Mr. Cruickshank's well-matured opinion, resulting from long experience and observation,
that there is no breed of cattle so easily maintained in good condition as the Shorthorns.
