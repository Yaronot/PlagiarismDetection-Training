I

It happened in the 'seventies in winter, on the day after St. Nicholas's Day. There was a fete
in the parish and the innkeeper, Vasili Andreevich Brekhunov, a Second Guild merchant, being
a church elder had to go to church, and had also to entertain his relatives and friends at home.

But when the last of them had gone he at once began to prepare to drive over to see a neighbouring
proprietor about a grove which he had been bargaining over for a long time. He was now in a
hurry to start, lest buyers from the town might forestall him in making a profitable purchase.

The youthful landowner was asking ten thousand rubles for the grove simply because Vasili Andreevich
was offering seven thousand. Seven thousand was, however, only a third of its real value. Vasili
Andreevich might perhaps have got it down to his own price, for the woods were in his district
and he had a long-standing agreement with the other village dealers that no one should run
up the price in another's district, but he had now learnt that some timber-dealers from town
meant to bid for the Goryachkin grove, and he resolved to go at once and get the matter settled.
So as soon as the feast was over, he took seven hundred rubles from his strong box, added to
them two thousand three hundred rubles of church money he had in his keeping, so as to make
up the sum to three thousand; carefully counted the notes, and having put them into his pocket-book
made haste to start.

Nikita, the only one of Vasili Andreevich's labourers who was not drunk that day, ran to harness
the horse. Nikita, though an habitual drunkard, was not drunk that day because since the last
day before the fast, when he had drunk his coat and leather boots, he had sworn off drink and
had kept his vow for two months, and was still keeping it despite the temptation of the vodka
that had been drunk everywhere during the first two days of the feast.

Nikita was a peasant of about fifty from a neighbouring village, 'not a manager' as the peasants
said of him, meaning that he was not the thrifty head of a household but lived most of his
time away from home as a labourer. He was valued everywhere for his industry, dexterity, and
strength at work, and still more for his kindly and pleasant temper. But he never settled down
anywhere for long because about twice a year, or even oftener, he had a drinking bout, and
then besides spending all his clothes on drink he became turbulent and quarrelsome. Vasili
Andreevich himself had turned him away several times, but had afterwards taken him back again--valuing
his honesty, his kindness to animals, and especially his cheapness. Vasili Andreevich did not
pay Nikita the eighty rubles a year such a man was worth, but only about forty, which he gave
him haphazard, in small sums, and even that mostly not in cash but in goods from his own shop
and at high prices.

Nikita's wife Martha, who had once been a handsome vigorous woman, managed the homestead with
the help of her son and two daughters, and did not urge Nikita to live at home: first because
she had been living for some twenty years already with a cooper, a peasant from another village
who lodged in their house; and secondly because though she managed her husband as she pleased
when he was sober, she feared him like fire when he was drunk. Once when he had got drunk at
home, Nikita, probably to make up for his submissiveness when sober, broke open her box, took
out her best clothes, snatched up an axe, and chopped all her undergarments and dresses to
bits. All the wages Nikita earned went to his wife, and he raised no objection to that. So
now, two days before the holiday, Martha had been twice to see Vasili Andreevich and had got
from him wheat flour, tea, sugar, and a quart of vodka, the lot costing three rubles, and also
five rubles in cash, for which she thanked him as for a special favour, though he owed Nikita
at least twenty rubles.

'What agreement did we ever draw up with you?' said Vasili Andreevich to Nikita. 'If you need
anything, take it; you will work it off. I'm not like others to keep you waiting, and making
up accounts and reckoning fines. We deal straight-forwardly. You serve me and I don't neglect you.'

And when saying this Vasili Andreevich was honestly convinced that he was Nikita's benefactor,
and he knew how to put it so plausibly that all those who depended on him for their money,
beginning with Nikita, confirmed him in the conviction that he was their benefactor and did
not overreach them.

'Yes, I understand, Vasili Andreevich. You know that I serve you and take as much pains as
I would for my own father. I understand very well!' Nikita would reply. He was quite aware
that Vasili Andreevich was cheating him, but at the same time he felt that it was useless to
try to clear up his accounts with him or explain his side of the matter, and that as long as
he had nowhere to go he must accept what he could get.

Now, having heard his master's order to harness, he went as usual cheerfully and willingly
to the shed, stepping briskly and easily on his rather turned-in feet; took down from a nail
the heavy tasselled leather bridle, and jingling the rings of the bit went to the closed stable
where the horse he was to harness was standing by himself.

'What, feeling lonely, feeling lonely, little silly?' said Nikita in answer to the low whinny
with which he was greeted by the good-tempered, medium-sized bay stallion, with a rather slanting
crupper, who stood alone in the shed. 'Now then, now then, there's time enough. Let me water
you first,' he went on, speaking to the horse just as to someone who understood the words he
was using, and having whisked the dusty, grooved back of the well-fed young stallion with the
skirt of his coat, he put a bridle on his handsome head, straightened his ears and forelock,
and having taken off his halter led him out to water.

Picking his way out of the dung-strewn stable, Mukhorty frisked, and making play with his hind
leg pretended that he meant to kick Nikita, who was running at a trot beside him to the pump.

'Now then, now then, you rascal!' Nikita called out, well knowing how carefully Mukhorty threw
out his hind leg just to touch his greasy sheepskin coat but not to strike him--a trick Nikita
much appreciated.

After a drink of the cold water the horse sighed, moving his strong wet lips, from the hairs
of which transparent drops fell into the trough; then standing still as if in thought, he suddenly
gave a loud snort.

'If you don't want any more, you needn't. But don't go asking for any later,' said Nikita quite
seriously and fully explaining his conduct to Mukhorty. Then he ran back to the shed pulling
the playful young horse, who wanted to gambol all over the yard, by the rein.

There was no one else in the yard except a stranger, the cook's husband, who had come for the
holiday.

'Go and ask which sledge is to be harnessed--the wide one or the small one--there's a good fellow!'

The cook's husband went into the house, which stood on an iron foundation and was iron-roofed,
and soon returned saying that the little one was to be harnessed. By that time Nikita had put
the collar and brass-studded belly-band on Mukhorty and, carrying a light, painted shaft-bow
in one hand, was leading the horse with the other up to two sledges that stood in the shed.

'All right, let it be the little one!' he said, backing the intelligent horse, which all the
time kept pretending to bite him, into the shafts, and with the aid of the cook's husband he
proceeded to harness. When everything was nearly ready and only the reins had to be adjusted,
Nikita sent the other man to the shed for some straw and to the barn for a drugget.

'There, that's all right! Now, now, don't bristle up!' said Nikita, pressing down into the
sledge the freshly threshed oat straw the cook's husband had brought. 'And now let's spread
the sacking like this, and the drugget over it. There, like that it will be comfortable sitting,'
he went on, suiting the action to the words and tucking the drugget all round over the straw
to make a seat.

'Thank you, dear man. Things always go quicker with two working at it!' he added. And gathering
up the leather reins fastened together by a brass ring, Nikita took the driver's seat and started
the impatient horse over the frozen manure which lay in the yard, towards the gate.

'Uncle Nikita! I say, Uncle, Uncle!' a high-pitched voice shouted, and a seven-year-old boy
in a black sheepskin coat, new white felt boots, and a warm cap, ran hurriedly out of the house
into the yard. 'Take me with you!' he cried, fastening up his coat as he ran.

'All right, come along, darling!' said Nikita, and stopping the sledge he picked up the master's
pale thin little son, radiant with joy, and drove out into the road.

It was past two o'clock and the day was windy, dull, and cold, with more than twenty degrees
Fahrenheit of frost. Half the sky was hidden by a lowering dark cloud. In the yard it was quiet,
but in the street the wind was felt more keenly. The snow swept down from a neighbouring shed
and whirled about in the corner near the bath-house.

Hardly had Nikita driven out of the yard and turned the horse's head to the house, before Vasili
Andreevich emerged from the high porch in front of the house with a cigarette in his mouth
and wearing a cloth-covered sheep-skin coat tightly girdled low at his waist, and stepped onto
the hard-trodden snow which squeaked under the leather soles of his felt boots, and stopped.
Taking a last whiff of his cigarette he threw it down, stepped on it, and letting the smoke
escape through his moustache and looking askance at the horse that was coming up, began to
tuck in his sheepskin collar on both sides of his ruddy face, clean-shaven except for the moustache,
so that his breath should not moisten the collar.

'See now! The young scamp is there already!' he exclaimed when he saw his little son in the
sledge. Vasili Andreevich was excited by the vodka he had drunk with his visitors, and so he
was even more pleased than usual with everything that was his and all that he did. The sight
of his son, whom he always thought of as his heir, now gave him great satisfaction. He looked
at him, screwing up his eyes and showing his long teeth.

His wife--pregnant, thin and pale, with her head and shoulders wrapped in a shawl so that nothing
of her face could be seen but her eyes--stood behind him in the vestibule to see him off.

'Now really, you ought to take Nikita with you,' she said timidly, stepping out from the doorway.

Vasili Andreevich did not answer. Her words evidently annoyed him and he frowned angrily and spat.

'You have money on you,' she continued in the same plaintive voice. 'What if the weather gets
worse! Do take him, for goodness' sake!'

'Why? Don't I know the road that I must needs take a guide?' exclaimed Vasili Andreevich, uttering
every word very distinctly and compressing his lips unnaturally, as he usually did when speaking
to buyers and sellers.

'Really you ought to take him. I beg you in God's name!' his wife repeated, wrapping her shawl
more closely round her head.

'There, she sticks to it like a leech!... Where am I to take him?'

'I'm quite ready to go with you, Vasili Andreevich,' said Nikita cheerfully. 'But they must
feed the horses while I am away,' he added, turning to his master's wife.

'I'll look after them, Nikita dear. I'll tell Simon,' replied the mistress.

'Well, Vasili Andreevich, am I to come with you?' said Nikita, awaiting a decision.

'It seems I must humour my old woman. But if you're coming you'd better put on a warmer cloak,'
said Vasili Andreevich, smiling again as he winked at Nikita's short sheepskin coat, which
was torn under the arms and at the back, was greasy and out of shape, frayed to a fringe round
the skirt, and had endured many things in its lifetime.

'Hey, dear man, come and hold the horse!' shouted Nikita to the cook's husband, who was still
in the yard.

'No, I will myself, I will myself!' shrieked the little boy, pulling his hands, red with cold,
out of his pockets, and seizing the cold leather reins.

'Only don't be too long dressing yourself up. Look alive!' shouted Vasili Andreevich, grinning
at Nikita.

'Only a moment, Father, Vasili Andreevich!' replied Nikita, and running quickly with his inturned
toes in his felt boots with their soles patched with felt, he hurried across the yard and into
the workmen's hut.

'Arinushka! Get my coat down from the stove. I'm going with the master,' he said, as he ran
into the hut and took down his girdle from the nail on which it hung.

The workmen's cook, who had had a sleep after dinner and was now getting the samovar ready
for her husband, turned cheerfully to Nikita, and infected by his hurry began to move as quickly
as he did, got down his miserable worn-out cloth coat from the stove where it was drying, and
began hurriedly shaking it out and smoothing it down.

'There now, you'll have a chance of a holiday with your good man,' said Nikita, who from kindhearted
politeness always said something to anyone he was alone with.

Then, drawing his worn narrow girdle round him, he drew in his breath, pulling in his lean
stomach still more, and girdled himself as tightly as he could over his sheepskin.

'There now,' he said addressing himself no longer to the cook but the girdle, as he tucked
the ends in at the waist, 'now you won't come undone!' And working his shoulders up and down
to free his arms, he put the coat over his sheepskin, arched his back more strongly to ease
his arms, poked himself under the armpits, and took down his leather-covered mittens from the
shelf. 'Now we're all right!'

'You ought to wrap your feet up, Nikita. Your boots are very bad.'

Nikita stopped as if he had suddenly realized this.

'Yes, I ought to.... But they'll do like this. It isn't far!' and he ran out into the yard.

'Won't you be cold, Nikita?' said the mistress as he came up to the sledge.

'Cold? No, I'm quite warm,' answered Nikita as he pushed some straw up to the forepart of the
sledge so that it should cover his feet, and stowed away the whip, which the good horse would
not need, at the bottom of the sledge.

Vasili Andreevich, who was wearing two fur-lined coats one over the other, was already in the
sledge, his broad back filling nearly its whole rounded width, and taking the reins he immediately
touched the horse. Nikita jumped in just as the sledge started, and seated himself in front
on the left side, with one leg hanging over the edge.

II

The good stallion took the sledge along at a brisk pace over the smooth-frozen road through
the village, the runners squeaking slightly as they went.

'Look at him hanging on there! Hand me the whip, Nikita!' shouted Vasili Andreevich, evidently
enjoying the sight of his 'heir,' who standing on the runners was hanging on at the back of
the sledge. 'I'll give it you! Be off to mamma, you dog!'

The boy jumped down. The horse increased his amble and, suddenly changing foot, broke into
a fast trot.

The Crosses, the village where Vasili Andreevich lived, consisted of six houses. As soon as
they had passed the blacksmith's hut, the last in the village, they realized that the wind
was much stronger than they had thought. The road could hardly be seen. The tracks left by
the sledge-runners were immediately covered by snow and the road was only distinguished by
the fact that it was higher than the rest of the ground. There was a swirl of snow over the
fields and the line where sky and earth met could not be seen. The Telyatin forest, usually
clearly visible, now only loomed up occasionally and dimly through the driving snowy dust.
The wind came from the left, insistently blowing over to one side the mane on Mukhorty's sleek
neck and carrying aside even his fluffy tail, which was tied in a simple knot. Nikita's wide
coat-collar, as he sat on the windy side, pressed close to his cheek and nose.

'This road doesn't give him a chance--it's too snowy,' said Vasili Andreevich, who prided himself
on his good horse. 'I once drove to Pashutino with him in half an hour.'

'What?' asked Nikita, who could not hear on account of his collar.

'I say I once went to Pashutino in half an hour,' shouted Vasili Andreevich.

'It goes without saying that he's a good horse,' replied Nikita.

They were silent for a while. But Vasili Andreevich wished to talk.

'Well, did you tell your wife not to give the cooper any vodka?' he began in the same loud
tone, quite convinced that Nikita must feel flattered to be talking with so clever and important
a person as himself, and he was so pleased with his jest that it did not enter his head that
the remark might be unpleasant to Nikita.

The wind again prevented Nikita's hearing his master's words.

Vasili Andreevich repeated the jest about the cooper in his loud, clear voice.

'That's their business, Vasili Andreevich. I don't pry into their affairs. As long as she doesn't
ill-treat our boy--God be with them.'

'That's so,' said Vasili Andreevich. 'Well, and will you be buying a horse in spring?' he went
on, changing the subject.

'Yes, I can't avoid it,' answered Nikita, turning down his collar and leaning back towards
his master.

The conversation now became interesting to him and he did not wish to lose a word.

'The lad's growing up. He must begin to plough for himself, but till now we've always had to
hire someone,' he said.

'Well, why not have the lean-cruppered one. I won't charge much for it,' shouted Vasili Andreevich,
feeling animated, and consequently starting on his favourite occupation--that of horse-dealing--which
absorbed all his mental powers.

'Or you might let me have fifteen rubles and I'll buy one at the horse-market,' said Nikita,
who knew that the horse Vasili Andreevich wanted to sell him would be dear at seven rubles,
but that if he took it from him it would be charged at twenty-five, and then he would be unable
to draw any money for half a year.

'It's a good horse. I think of your interest as of my own--according to conscience. Brekhunov
isn't a man to wrong anyone. Let the loss be mine. I'm not like others. Honestly!' he shouted
in the voice in which he hypnotized his customers and dealers. 'It's a real good horse.'

'Quite so!' said Nikita with a sigh, and convinced that there was nothing more to listen to,
he again released his collar, which immediately covered his ear and face.

They drove on in silence for about half an hour. The wind blew sharply onto Nikita's side and
arm where his sheepskin was torn.

He huddled up and breathed into the collar which covered his mouth, and was not wholly cold.

'What do you think--shall we go through Karamyshevo or by the straight road?' asked Vasili
Andreevich.

The road through Karamyshevo was more frequented and was well marked with a double row of high
stakes. The straight road was nearer but little used and had no stakes, or only poor ones covered
with snow.

Nikita thought awhile.

'Though Karamyshevo is farther, it is better going,' he said.

'But by the straight road, when once we get through the hollow by the forest, it's good going--sheltered,'
said Vasili Andreevich, who wished to go the nearest way.

'Just as you please,' said Nikita, and again let go of his collar.

Vasili Andreevich did as he had said, and having gone about half a verst came to a tall oak
stake which had a few dry leaves still dangling on it, and there he turned to the left.

On turning they faced directly against the wind, and snow was beginning to fall. Vasili Andreevich,
who was driving, inflated his cheeks, blowing the breath out through his moustache. Nikita dozed.

So they went on in silence for about ten minutes. Suddenly Vasili Andreevich began saying something.

'Eh, what?' asked Nikita, opening his eyes.

Vasili Andreevich did not answer, but bent over, looking behind them and then ahead of the
horse. The sweat had curled Mukhorty's coat between his legs and on his neck. He went at a walk.

'What is it?' Nikita asked again.

'What is it? What is it?' Vasili Andreevich mimicked him angrily. 'There are no stakes to be
seen! We must have got off the road!'

'Well, pull up then, and I'll look for it,' said Nikita, and jumping down lightly from the
sledge and taking the whip from under the straw, he went off to the left from his own side
of the sledge.

The snow was not deep that year, so that it was possible to walk anywhere, but still in places
it was knee-deep and got into Nikita's boots. He went about feeling the ground with his feet
and the whip, but could not find the road anywhere.

'Well, how is it?' asked Vasili Andreevich when Nikita came back to the sledge.

'There is no road this side. I must go to the other side and try there,' said Nikita.

'There's something there in front. Go and have a look.'

Nikita went to what had appeared dark, but found that it was earth which the wind had blown
from the bare fields of winter oats and had strewn over the snow, colouring it. Having searched
to the right also, he returned to the sledge, brushed the snow from his coat, shook it out
of his boots, and seated himself once more.

'We must go to the right,' he said decidedly. 'The wind was blowing on our left before, but
now it is straight in my face. Drive to the right,' he repeated with decision.

Vasili Andreevich took his advice and turned to the right, but still there was no road. They
went on in that direction for some time. The wind was as fierce as ever and it was snowing lightly.

'It seems, Vasili Andreevich, that we have gone quite astray,' Nikita suddenly remarked, as
if it were a pleasant thing. 'What is that?' he added, pointing to some potato vines that showed
up from under the snow.

Vasili Andreevich stopped the perspiring horse, whose deep sides were heaving heavily.

'What is it?'

'Why, we are on the Zakharov lands. See where we've got to!'

'Nonsense!' retorted Vasili Andreevich.

'It's not nonsense, Vasili Andreevich. It's the truth,' replied Nikita. 'You can feel that
the sledge is going over a potato-field, and there are the heaps of vines which have been carted
here. It's the Zakharov factory land.'

'Dear me, how we have gone astray!' said Vasili Andreevich. 'What are we to do now?'

'We must go straight on, that's all. We shall come out somewhere--if not at Zakharova, then
at the proprietor's farm,' said Nikita.

Vasili Andreevich agreed, and drove as Nikita had indicated. So they went on for a considerable
time. At times they came onto bare fields and the sledge-runners rattled over frozen lumps
of earth. Sometimes they got onto a winter-rye field, or a fallow field on which they could
see stalks of wormwood, and straws sticking up through the snow and swaying in the wind; sometimes
they came onto deep and even white snow, above which nothing was to be seen.

The snow was falling from above and sometimes rose from below. The horse was evidently exhausted,
his hair had all curled up from sweat and was covered with hoar-frost, and he went at a walk.
Suddenly he stumbled and sat down in a ditch or water-course. Vasili Andreevich wanted to stop,
but Nikita cried to him:

'Why stop? We've got in and must get out. Hey, pet! Hey, darling! Gee up, old fellow!' he shouted
in a cheerful tone to the horse, jumping out of the sledge and himself getting stuck in the ditch.

The horse gave a start and quickly climbed out onto the frozen bank. It was evidently a ditch
that had been dug there.

'Where are we now?' asked Vasili Andreevich.

'We'll soon find out!' Nikita replied. 'Go on, we'll get somewhere.'

'Why, this must be the Goryachkin forest!' said Vasili Andreevich, pointing to something dark
that appeared amid the snow in front of them.

'We'll see what forest it is when we get there,' said Nikita.

He saw that beside the black thing they had noticed, dry, oblong willow-leaves were fluttering,
and so he knew it was not a forest but a settlement, but he did not wish to say so. And in
fact they had not gone twenty-five yards beyond the ditch before something in front of them,
evidently trees, showed up black, and they heard a new and melancholy sound. Nikita had guessed
right: it was not a wood, but a row of tall willows with a few leaves still fluttering on them
here and there. They had evidently been planted along the ditch round a threshing-floor. Coming
up to the willows, which moaned sadly in the wind, the horse suddenly planted his forelegs
above the height of the sledge, drew up his hind legs also, pulling the sledge onto higher
ground, and turned to the left, no longer sinking up to his knees in snow. They were back on
a road.

'Well, here we are, but heaven only knows where!' said Nikita.

The horse kept straight along the road through the drifted snow, and before they had gone another
hundred yards the straight line of the dark wattle wall of a barn showed up black before them,
its roof heavily covered with snow which poured down from it. After passing the barn the road
turned to the wind and they drove into a snow-drift. But ahead of them was a lane with houses
on either side, so evidently the snow had been blown across the road and they had to drive
through the drift. And so in fact it was. Having driven through the snow they came out into
a street. At the end house of the village some frozen clothes hanging on a line--shirts, one
red and one white, trousers, leg-bands, and a petticoat--fluttered wildly in the wind. The
white shirt in particular struggled desperately, waving its sleeves about.

'There now, either a lazy woman or a dead one has not taken her clothes down before the holiday,'
remarked Nikita, looking at the fluttering shirts.

III

At the entrance to the street the wind still raged and the road was thickly covered with snow,
but well within the village it was calm, warm, and cheerful. At one house a dog was barking,
at another a woman, covering her head with her coat, came running from somewhere and entered
the door of a hut, stopping on the threshold to have a look at the passing sledge. In the middle
of the village girls could be heard singing.

Here in the village there seemed to be less wind and snow, and the frost was less keen.

'Why, this is Grishkino,' said Vasili Andreevich.

'So it is,' responded Nikita.

It really was Grishkino, which meant that they had gone too far to the left and had travelled
some six miles, not quite in the direction they aimed at, but towards their destination for
all that.

From Grishkino to Goryachkin was about another four miles.

In the middle of the village they almost ran into a tall man walking down the middle of the street.

'Who are you?' shouted the man, stopping the horse, and recognizing Vasili Anereevich he immediately
took hold of the shaft, went along it hand over hand till he reached the sledge, and placed
himself on the driver's seat.

He was Isay, a peasant of Vasili Andreevich's acquaintance, and well known as the principal
horse-thief in the district.

'Ah, Vasili Andreevich! Where are you off to?' said Isay, enveloping Nikita in the odour of
the vodka he had drunk.

'We were going to Goryachkin.'

'And look where you've got to! You should have gone through Molchanovka.'

'Should have, but didn't manage it,' said Vasili Andreevich, holding in the horse.

'That's a good horse,' said Isay, with a shrewd glance at Mukhorty, and with a practised hand
he tightened the loosened knot high in the horse's bushy tail.

'Are you going to stay the night?'

'No, friend. I must get on.'

'Your business must be pressing. And who is this? Ah, Nikita Stepanych!'

'Who else?' replied Nikita. 'But I say, good friend, how are we to avoid going astray again?'

'Where can you go astray here? Turn back straight down the street and then when you come out
keep straight on. Don't take to the left. You will come out onto the high road, and then turn
to the right.'

'And where do we turn off the high road? As in summer, or the winter way?' asked Nikita.

'The winter way. As soon as you turn off you'll see some bushes, and opposite them there is
a way-mark--a large oak, one with branches--and that's the way.'

Vasili Andreevich turned the horse back and drove through the outskirts of the village.

'Why not stay the night?' Isay shouted after them.

But Vasili Andreevich did not answer and touched up the horse. Four miles of good road, two
of which lay through the forest, seemed easy to manage, especially as the wind was apparently
quieter and the snow had stopped.

Having driven along the trodden village street, darkened here and there by fresh manure, past
the yard where the clothes hung out and where the white shirt had broken loose and was now
attached only by one frozen sleeve, they again came within sound of the weird moan of the willows,
and again emerged on the open fields. The storm, far from ceasing, seemed to have grown yet
stronger. The road was completely covered with drifting snow, and only the stakes showed that
they had not lost their way. But even the stakes ahead of them were not easy to see, since
the wind blew in their faces.

Vasili Andreevich screwed up his eyes, bent down his head, and looked out for the way-marks,
but trusted mainly to the horse's sagacity, letting it take its own way. And the horse really
did not lose the road but followed its windings, turning now to the right and now to the left
and sensing it under his feet, so that though the snow fell thicker and the wind strengthened
they still continued to see way-marks now to the left and now to the right of them.

So they travelled on for about ten minutes, when suddenly, through the slanting screen of wind-driven
snow, something black showed up which moved in front of the horse.

This was another sledge with fellow-travellers. Mukhorty overtook them, and struck his hoofs
against the back of the sledge in front of them.

'Pass on... hey there... get in front!' cried voices from the sledge.

Vasili Andreevich swerved aside to pass the other sledge.

In it sat three men and a woman, evidently visitors returning from a feast. One peasant was
whacking the snow-covered croup of their little horse with a long switch, and the other two
sitting in front waved their arms and shouted something. The woman, completely wrapped up and
covered with snow, sat drowsing and bumping at the back.

'Who are you?' shouted Vasili Andreevich.

'From A-a-a...' was all that could be heard.

'I say, where are you from?'

'From A-a-a-a!' one of the peasants shouted with all his might, but still it was impossible
to make out who they were.

'Get along! Keep up!' shouted another, ceaselessly beating his horse with the switch.

'So you're from a feast, it seems?'

'Go on, go on! Faster, Simon! Get in front! Faster!'

The wings of the sledges bumped against one another, almost got jammed but managed to separate,
and the peasants' sledge began to fall behind.

Their shaggy, big-bellied horse, all covered with snow, breathed heavily under the low shaft-bow
and, evidently using the last of its strength, vainly endeavoured to escape from the switch,
hobbling with its short legs through the deep snow which it threw up under itself.

Its muzzle, young-looking, with the nether lip drawn up like that of a fish, nostrils distended
and ears pressed back from fear, kept up for a few seconds near Nikita's shoulder and then
began to fall behind.

'Just see what liquor does!' said Nikita. 'They've tired that little horse to death. What pagans!'

For a few minutes they heard the panting of the tired little horse and the drunken shouting
of the peasants. Then the panting and the shouts died away, and around them nothing could be
heard but the whistling of the wind in their ears and now and then the squeak of their sledge-runners
over a windswept part of the road.

This encounter cheered and enlivened Vasili Andreevich, and he drove on more boldly without
examining the way-marks, urging on the horse and trusting to him.

Nikita had nothing to do, and as usual in such circumstances he drowsed, making up for much
sleepless time. Suddenly the horse stopped and Nikita nearly fell forward onto his nose.

'You know we're off the track again!' said Vasili Andreevich.

'How's that?'

'Why, there are no way-marks to be seen. We must have got off the road again.'

'Well, if we've lost the road we must find it,' said Nikita curtly, and getting out and stepping
lightly on his pigeon-toed feet he started once more going about on the snow.

He walked about for a long time, now disappearing and now reappearing, and finally he came back.

'There is no road here. There may be farther on,' he said, getting into the sledge.

It was already growing dark. The snow-storm had not increased but had also not subsided.

'If we could only hear those peasants!' said Vasili Andreevich.

'Well they haven't caught us up. We must have gone far astray. Or maybe they have lost their
way too.'

'Where are we to go then?' asked Vasili Andreevich.

'Why, we must let the horse take its own way,' said Nikita. 'He will take us right. Let me
have the reins.'

Vasili Andreevich gave him the reins, the more willingly because his hands were beginning to
feel frozen in his thick gloves.

Nikita took the reins, but only held them, trying not to shake them and rejoicing at his favourite's
sagacity. And indeed the clever horse, turning first one ear and then the other now to one
side and then to the other, began to wheel round.

'The one thing he can't do is to talk,' Nikita kept saying. 'See what he is doing! Go on, go
on! You know best. That's it, that's it!'

The wind was now blowing from behind and it felt warmer.

'Yes, he's clever,' Nikita continued, admiring the horse. 'A Kirgiz horse is strong but stupid.
But this one--just see what he's doing with his ears! He doesn't need any telegraph. He can
scent a mile off.'

Before another half-hour had passed they saw something dark ahead of them--a wood or a village--and
stakes again appeared to the right. They had evidently come out onto the road.

'Why, that's Grishkino again!' Nikita suddenly exclaimed.

And indeed, there on their left was that same barn with the snow flying from it, and farther
on the same line with the frozen washing, shirts and trousers, which still fluttered desperately
in the wind.

Again they drove into the street and again it grew quiet, warm, and cheerful, and again they
could see the manure-stained street and hear voices and songs and the barking of a dog. It
was already so dark that there were lights in some of the windows.

Half-way through the village Vasili Andreevich turned the horse towards a large double-fronted
brick house and stopped at the porch.

Nikita went to the lighted snow-covered window, in the rays of which flying snow-flakes glittered,
and knocked at it with his whip.
