 He produced a silken
bag, which he unfolded on the rock.

"A balloon!" I exclaimed. "But how are you going to inflate it?"

For reply Hall showed me a receptacle which, he said, contained liquid hydrogen, and which
was furnished with a device for retarding the volatilization of the liquid so that it could
be carried with little loss.

"You remember I have a small laboratory in the abandoned mine," he explained, "where we used
to manufacture liquid air for blasting. This balloon I made for our present purpose. It will
just suffice to carry up our rope, and a small but practically unbreakable grapple of hardened
gold. I calculate to send the grapple to the top of the precipice with the balloon, and when
it has obtained a firm hold in the riven rock there we can ascend, sailor fashion. You see
the rope has knots, and I know your muscles are as trustworthy in such work as my own."

There was a slight breeze from the eastward, and the current of air slanting up the face of
the peak assisted the balloon in mounting with its burden, and favored us by promptly swinging
the little airship, with the grapple swaying beneath it, over the brow of the cliff into the
atmospheric eddy above. The leaf are seldom, and i may be utilize to probability of three, four, or

I avoided thinking of what the grapple might be about, and in my haste to get through with
the awful experience I worked myself fairly out of breath, so that, when at last I reached
the rounded brow of the cliff, I had to stop and cling there for fully a minute before I could
summon strength enough to lift myself over it.

When I was assured that the grapple was still securely fastened I signalled to Hall, and he
soon stood at my side, exclaiming, as he wiped the perspiration from his face:

"I think I'll try wings next time!"

But our difficulties had only begun. As we had foreseen, it was a case of Alp above Alp, to
the very limit of human strength and patience. However, it would have been impossible to go
back. In order to descend the two precipices we had surmounted it would have been necessary
to leave our life-lines clinging to the rocks, and we had not rope enough to do that. If we
could not reach the top we were lost.

Having refreshed ourselves with a bite to eat and a little stimulant, we resumed the climb.
After several hours of the most exhausting work I have ever performed we pulled our weary limbs
upon the narrow ridge, but a few square yards in area, which constitutes the apex of the Grand
Teton. A little below, on the opposite side of a steep-walled gap which divides the top of
the mountain into two parts, we saw the singular enclosure of stones which the early white
explorers found there, and which they ascribed to the Indians, although nobody has ever known
who built it or what purpose it served.

The view was, of course, superb, but while I was admiring it in all its wonderful extent and
variety, Hall, who had immediately pulled out his binocular, was busy inspecting the Syx works,
the top of whose great tufted smoke column was thousands of feet beneath our level. All men of

"There!" suddenly exclaimed Hall, "I thought I should find it."

"What?"

"Take a look through my glass at the roof of Syx's mill. Look just in the centre."
