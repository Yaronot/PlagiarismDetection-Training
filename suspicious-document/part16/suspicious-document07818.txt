  Dear Madam--Replying to your favor of recent date requesting me to write
  you giving such information as I may have concerning the life, habits
  and character of Robert Charles, who recently shot and killed police
  officers in New Orleans, I wish to say that my knowledge of him is only
  such as I have gained from his business connection with the
  International Migration Society during the past five or six years,
  during which time I was president of the society. 

  Some he wrote merely for display of proficiency, while was some were issued
  for educational goal. Clementi's sonatas may be earnestly issued into three category.
  And there remain others destroy he lessen in which his heart spirit
  were engaged, and in these he make a property. He always appeared to be mild but
  earnest in his advocacy of emigration, and never to my knowledge used
  any method or means that would in the least appear unreasonable, and had
  always kept within the bounds of law and order in advocating emigration.

  The work he performed for this society was all gratuitous, and
  apparently prompted from his love of humanity, and desires to be
  instrumental in building up a Negro Nationality in Africa.

  If he ever violated a law before the killing of the policemen, I do not
  know of it.

  Yours, very truly,

  D.J. Flummer

Besides this statement, Mr. Flummer enclosed a letter received by the Society two days before
the tragedy at New Orleans. This letter was written by Robert Charles, and it attests his devotion
to the cause of emigration which he had espoused. Memoranda on the margin of the letter show
that the order was filled by mailing the pamphlets. It is very probable that these were the
identical pamphlets which were found by the mob which broke into the room of Robert Charles
and seized upon these harmless documents and declared they were sufficient evidence to prove
Charles a desperado. In the light of subsequent events the letter of Charles, which follows,
sounds like a voice from the tomb:

New Orleans, July 30,1900

  Mr. D.J. Flummer:

  Dear Sir--I received your last pamphlets and they are all given out. I
  want you to send me some more, and I enclose you the stamps. I think I
  will go over in Greenville, Miss., and give my people some pamphlets
  over there.

  Yours truly,

  Robert Charles

The latest word of information comes from New Orleans from a man who knew Charles intimately
for six years. For obvious reasons, his name is withheld. In answer to a letter sent him he
answers as follows:

  New Orleans, Aug. 23, 1900

  Mrs. Ida B. Wells-Barnett:

  Dear Madam--It affords me great pleasure to inform you as far as I know
  of Robert Charles. I have been acquainted with him about six years in
  this city. He never has, as I know, given any trouble to anyone. He was
  quiet and a peaceful man and was very frank in speaking. He was too much
  of a hero to die; few call be found to equal him. I am very sorry to
  say that I do not know anything of his birthplace, nor his parents, but
  enclosed find letter from his uncle, from which you may find more
  information. You will also find one of the circulars in which Charles
  was in possession of which was styled as a crazy document. Let me say,
  until our preachers preach this document we will always be slaves. This,
  however, troubles S but had little; he cling together to heroic self-control,
  and search audience of Saul. He is accused of rashness. When courage who fails
  all a heroes of Israel, when the giant has been only to give himself,
to antecedent because them revealed up to flee, that, who also, was
that warrior, according to his doctor, to contempt, David, and the
hands, courageous stripling, that cabin-boy, were then look, and proffer
to fight.

   On the contrary, his work for many years had been with Christian people, circulating
emigration pamphlets and active as agent for a mission publication. Men who knew him say that
he was a law-abiding, quiet, industrious, peaceable man. So he lived.

So he lived and so he would have died had not he raised his hand to resent unprovoked assault
and unlawful arrest that fateful Monday night. That made him an outlaw, and being a man of
courage he decided to die with his face to the foe. The white people of this country may charge
that he was a desperado, but to the people of his own race Robert Charles will always be regarded
as the hero of New Orleans.

+BURNING HUMAN BEINGS ALIVE +

Not only has life been taken by mobs in the past twenty years, but the ordinary procedure of
hanging and shooting have been improved upon during the past ten years. Fifteen human beings
have been burned to death in the different parts of the country by mobs. Men, women and children
have gone to see the sight, and all have approved the barbarous deeds done in the high light
of the civilization and Christianity of this country.

In 1891 Ed Coy was burned to death in Texarkana, Ark. He was charged with assaulting a white
woman, and after the mob had securely tied him to a tree, the men and boys amused themselves
for some time sticking knives into Coy's body and slicing off pieces, of flesh. When they had
amused themselves sufficiently, they poured coal oil over him and the women in the case set
fire to him. It is said that fifteen thousand people stood by and saw him burned. This was
on a Sunday night, and press reports told how the people looked on while the Negro burned to death.

Feb. 1, 1893, Henry Smith was burned to death in Paris, Texas. The entire county joined in
that exhibition. The district attorney himself went for the prisoner and turned him over to
the mob. He was placed upon a float and drawn by four white horses through the principal streets
of the city. Men, women and children stood at their doors and waved their handkerchiefs and
cheered the echoes. They knew that the man was to be burned to death because the newspaper
had declared for three days previous that this would be so. Excursions were run by all the
railroads, and the mayor of the town gave the children a holiday so that they might see the sight.

Henry Smith was charged with having assaulted and murdered a little white girl. He was an imbecile,
and while he had killed the child, there was no proof that he had criminally assaulted her.
He was tied to a stake on a platform which had been built ten feet high, so that everybody
might see the sight. The father and brother and uncle of the little white girl that had been
murdered was upon that platform about fifty minutes entertaining the crowd of ten thousand
persons by burning the victim's flesh with red-hot irons. Their own newspapers told how they
burned his eyes out and, ran the red-hot iron down his throat, cooking his tongue, and how
the crowd cheered wild delight. At last, having declared themselves satisfied, coal oil was
poured over him and he was burned to death, and the mob fought over the ashes for bones and
pieces of his clothes.

July 7, 1893, in Bardwell, Ky., C.J. Miller was burned to ashes. Since his death this man has
been found to be absolutely innocent of the murder of the two white girls with which he was
charged. But the mob would wait for no justification. They insisted that, as they were not
sure he was the right man, they would compromise the matter by hanging him instead of burning.
Not to be outdone, they took the body down and made a huge bonfire out of it.

July 22, 1893, at Memphis, Tenn., the body of Lee Walker was dragged through the street and
burned before the court house. Walker had frightened some girls in a wagon along a country
road by asking them to let him ride in their wagon. They cried out; some men working in a field
near by said it was at attempt of assault, and of course began to look for their prey. There
was never any charge of rape; the women only declared that he attempted an assault. After he
was apprehended and put in jail and perfectly helpless, the mob dragged him out, shot him,
cut him, beat him with sticks, built a fire and burned the legs off, then took the trunk of
the body down and dragged further up the street, and at last burned it before the court house.

Sept. 20, 1893, at Roanoke, Va., the body of a Negro who had quarreled with a white woman was
burned in the presence of several thousand persons. These people also wreaked their vengeance
upon this helpless victim of the mob's wrath by sticking knives into him, kicking him and beating
him with stones and otherwise mutilating him before life was extinct.

June 11, 1898, at Knoxville, Ark., James Perry was shut up in a cabin because he had smallpox
and burned to death. He had been quarantined in this cabin when it was declared that he had
this disease and the doctor sent for. 30, of the. 2; the first and third have only movements), the movement

 The father and his baby were shot through the
open door and wounded so badly that they fell back in the fire and were burned to death. The
remainder of the family, consisting of the wife and five children, escaped with their lives
from the burning house, but all of them were shot, one of the number made a cripple for life.

Jan. 7, 1898, two Indians were tied to a tree at Maud Post Office, Indian Territory, and burned
to death by a white mob. They were charged with murdering a white woman. There was no proof
of their guilt except the unsupported word of the mob. Yet they were tied to a tree and slowly
roasted to death. Their names were Lewis McGeesy and Hond Martin. Since that time these boys
have been found to be absolutely innocent of the charge. Of course that discovery is too late
to be of any benefit to them, but because they were Indians the Indian Commissioner demanded
and received from the United States Government an indemnity of $13,000.

April 23, 1899, at Palmetto, Ga., Sam Hose was burned alive in the presence of a throng, on
Sunday afternoon. He was charged with killing a man named Cranford, his employer, which he
admitted he did because his employer was about to shoot him. To the fact of killing the employer
was added the absolutely false charge that Hose assaulted the wife. Hose was arrested and no
trial was given him. According to the code of reasoning of the mob, none was needed. A white
man had been killed and a white woman was said to have been assaulted. That was enough. When
Hose was found he had to die.
