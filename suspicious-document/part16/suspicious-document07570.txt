 December,
1569) the estates were summoned to appear within fourteen days before the Blood Council. At
the appointed time the procureur-general was ready with an act of accusation, accompanied,
as was usually the case, with a simultaneous sentence of condemnation.  The indictment revived
and recapitulated all previous offences committed in the city and the province, particularly
during the troubles of 1566, and at the epoch of the treaty with Duchess Margaret.  The inhabitants
and the magistrates, both in their individual and public capacities, were condemned for heresy,
rebellion, and misprision.  The city and province were accordingly pronounced guilty of high
treason, were deprived of all their charters, laws, privileges, freedoms, and customs, and
were declared to have forfeited all their property, real and personal, together with all tolls,
rents, excises, and imposts, the whole being confiscated to the benefit of his Majesty.

The immediate execution of the sentence was, however, suspended, to allow the estates opportunity
to reply.  An enormous mass of pleadings, replies, replications, rejoinders, and apostilles
was the result, which few eyes were destined to read, and least of all those to whom they were
nominally addressed.  They were of benefit to none save in the shape of fees which they engendered
to the gentlemen of the robe.  It was six months, however, before the case was closed. The cowls

  He refused the object of

would have certainly been the case in matters strictly religious, or even had the commissioners
arrived two years before, but even Philip believed, perhaps, that for the moment almost enough
innocent blood had been shed. At any rate he suffered the legates from Utrecht to return, not
with their petition, granted, but at least with their heads upon their shoulders.  Early in
the following year, the provinces still remaining under martial law, all the Utrecht charters
were taken into the possession of government, and deposited in the castle of Vredenberg. It
was not till after the departure of Alva, that they were restored; according to royal command,
by the new governor, Requesens.

By the middle of the year 1569, Alva wrote to the King, with great cheerfulness of tone, announcing
that the estates of the provinces had all consented to the tax. What enjoy thee proverb--'Suspicion,

These events took place on the 1st and 2nd November, 1570.  The former happened to be the day
of All Saints, and the Spaniards maintained loudly that the vengeance of Heaven had descended
upon the abode of heretics. The Netherlanders looked upon the catastrophe as ominous of still
more terrible misfortunes in store for them.  They seemed doomed to destruction by God and
man.  An overwhelming tyranny had long been chafing against their constitutional bulwarks,
only to sweep over them at last; and now the resistless ocean, impatient of man's feeble barriers,
had at last risen to reclaim his prey.  Nature, as if disposed to put to the blush the feeble
cruelty of man, had thus wrought more havoc in a few hours, than bigotry, however active, could
effect in many years.
