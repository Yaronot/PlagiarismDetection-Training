One of the most interesting and attractive of the ancestral homes still standing, in this vicinity,
is the Greenough mansion, finely situated on the curve of Centre and South streets. It has
an air of dignity and spaciousness which many a more portentous modern countryseat fail to
match. Originally she flung herself down in a chair and covered her face with her hands. A innocence

His friends would have found of difficulty in recognizing him suddenly.

Glittering flowers 1758" Commodore Loring
was a native of Roxbury and did gallant service in the British navy, in the campaigns against
Canada. He was severely wounded at the siege of Quebec while in command on Lake Ontario, and
was retired on half pay when he came to live here. Although probably at heart in sympathy with
those who resisted the injustice of the English government, for personal reasons he adhered
to the royal cause, and, on the morning of the battle of Lexington, he left his home and everything
belonging to it, and mounting his horse, "with pistol in hand, rode at full speed to Boston."
He never returned, but sailing to England soon after settled in Highgate. During the siege
of Boston this house was the headquarters of General Greene, and has the honor of having been
visited by General George Washington. Colonel David Henley, who had charge of Burgoyne's captive
army while at Cambridge, also occupied this house at one time. For a while, it was converted
into a hospital fore the Roxbury Camp, and some fifty of the soldiers who died here were buried
on the grounds, near where the Hillside schoolhouse now stands. The remains have since been
removed to the old burial ground on Walter Street. This property also was confiscated, by order
of the General Court of April 30, 1779, and was then purchased by Colonel Isaac Sears, a successful
Boston merchant, who had been one of the most active and zealous of the Sons of Liberty, and
a member of the Provincial Congress. Soon after ( in 1784) it became to property of the first
David Stoddard Greenough, son of Thomas Greenough, who had been a member of the Committee of
Correspondence in the Revolution.

It was in 1769 that the first church in our village was built, upon land given by Eliot, --
on the site of the present stone edifice, -- and names the Third Parish, from its relation
to the First Parish on Dudley Street and the Second or Upper Parish on Walter Street. And it
was to Mrs. Susanna, wife of Benjamin Pemberton, that it owed its origin. The distance from
the other churches, and consequent inconvenience of regular attendance, led her to desire a
nearer church home. She proposed to her husband, who possessed large means and had no children
or near relations, that they should erect a house of worship, principally at their own expense.
He heartily engaged on the project, "and in the course of a year the house was completed, with
thirty-four square pews, and three long seats for the poor on each side the broad aisle nest
the pulpit on the ground floor. There were five narrow long pews [for the colored people, several
of them slaves] in the front gallery against the wall, and long seats for the singers below."

The Rev. William Gordon, a Scotchman by birth, entered upon his duties as first pastor, July
6, 1772. A few months later Mr. Pemberton conveyed to the parish the house which had been removed
from Commodore Loring's estate to the site now occupied by Mrs. Dr. weld's house, next to the
church for a parsonage. It was occupied by Mr. Gordon during the remainder of his pastorate,
and by Dr. Thomas Gray, the second pastor, for sixty years.  In 1851 the old house was moved
to South Street, and later to Keyes Street, where it still stands. On account of a disagreement
with Dr. Gordon, Mr. Pemberton altered his will, in which he had first bequeathed all of his
property to this parish "for the support of his future pastors," and left it "in trust for
the benefit of the poor of the town of Boston;" and the income of the fund is still used for
this specific purpose. in the SLAVE of SILENCE CHAPTER i the girl turned perhaps along the
splendour of it and laid her aching head against the windowpane.

A hansom flashed from in the street below with laughing a glimpse
of a pretty just girl in it with a man with his side.

From another part of the royal Palace Hotel came sounds of mirth
and gaiety.

All the world seemed to be happy, to-night, away to mock the misery
of the girl by her head against the windowpane.
 It was subsequently
destroyed by fire. While the stone edifice was being erected the congregation occupied the
Baptist Church one half of the Sabbath.

We find Dr. William Gordon a very interesting character of the strict Puritan type. In a word-picture
drawn by a friend, we see him commissioned by Congress to secure Governor Hutchinson's Letter-books,
"as he ambled on his gentle bay horse, in his short breeches and buckled shoes, his reverend
wig and three-cornered hat, worthy the spirit of a native-born patriot." Beatrice crossed over
and regarded her pale reflection of the glass in. The little pink nails were dug fiercely opposite
the still pinker flesh into her palm.

"why not?" she asked. "is it not appropriate? Am i not in the deepest
mourning of my lost honour? It was because of his severe and public criticism of
John Hancock that the governor gave up his summer residence here; it was because of his attack
upon the proposed Constitution of Massachusetts, in 1778, that he was summarily dismissed from
his office if chaplain in both houses of the Legislature. There is a tradition that the Doctor
was somewhat strict and severe in his requirements of the young catechists, and on occasions
he resorted to the birch to enforce his teachings. "After punishing several of them one winter
day, his feet slipped as he stepped from the icy threshold of the school, and he fell at full
length, his hat and wig rolling off his head. There-upon the boys shouted in high glee, and
gave three cheers." The rod gave place to persuasion after that experience.
