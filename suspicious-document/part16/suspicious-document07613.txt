Many public men might be named who, living at the time of Harrison's elevation, were very much
his political superiors; in his very cabinet were at least three, Webster, Crittenden, and
Ewing; and John Tyler was very far from being in the front rank of American statesmen, though
his political capacity has sometimes been underrated.

[Footnote 1: Monroe was chosen for his second term by every vote but one in the Electoral College.
That vote was given by Mr. Hummer of New Hampshire, on the ground that it was a dangerous precedent
to elect a President unanimously.]

Polk was the weakest of all our later Presidents, and he too presided over at least three secretaries
who were intellectually larger men, in Marcy, Robert J. Walker, and Buchanan. The same may
be said in comparing General Taylor with his advisers, and Fillmore, Pierce, and Lincoln with
theirs; for while no one can fail to revere the grand moral and practical qualities which make
Lincoln illustrious, in purely intellectual eminence he was excelled by Seward, Chase, and
perhaps Stanton.

[Sidenote: A Conservative Republic.]

[Sidenote: Origin of the Presidents.]

Ours has always been a conservative Republic. The French Republicans of '93 and '48, the Communards
of '71, did not derive their wild and visionary fanaticism from our example, although there
can be no doubt that our Revolution had not a little influence in hastening that of France.
When the people have been called upon to choose a chief magistrate, therefore, they have not
sought men of extreme views, nor have humble birth and limited education often been recommendations
of candidates. It is notable that the first six Presidents were selected from the class which
in England is called the "gentry." Washington, indeed, belonged to the high rural aristocracy
of Virginia; Mount Vernon was as much a patrician manor-house as are the "halls," "priories,"
and "manors" of rural England; and he lived there in the style of a country magnate, John Adams
belonged to the sturdy New England yeomanry sprung from the Pilgrims, and, as the descendant
of John Alden, had some reason to pride himself upon good blood. The three succeeding Virginia
Presidents were sons of gentlemen-farmers, and belonged to the cultivated gentry of the Old
Dominion. Jackson was the first of the plebeian Presidents, and then came Van Buren, of the
gentry by birth; Harrison, the son of a signer of the Declaration, and thus well born, and
Tyler, another Virginia gentleman, the lord of Sherwood Forest. Polk belonged to the same rural
condition. Fillmore was the next President of humble beginnings, and Lincoln the third; while
Andrew Johnson, who learned to read after he was married, and began life as a country tailor,
was the most lowly born of all our chief magistrates.

[Sidenote: Military Presidents.]

Those young men who, having a taste for and ambition in politics, adopt the law as a stepping-stone
to political honor, may derive some encouragement from the classification of the Presidents
by their professions; for out of the twenty-two Presidents, no less than eighteen were at some
period of their lives practising at the bar. The four who were not lawyers were the four military
Presidents, Washington, Harrison, Taylor, and Grant. Three other Presidents, however, derived
something of their fame from military careers--Monroe, Jackson, and Pierce. Monroe was a revolutionary
colonel, Jackson the hero of New Orleans, and Pierce a brigadier in the Mexican War. But Monroe
owed his political eminence to diplomatic successes and the friendship of Jefferson and Madison:
while Pierce certainly did not win the presidency by his Mexican exploits.

[Sidenote: Presidential Succession.]

No man has ever yet passed directly from the United States Senate to the White House. Of the
Presidents, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, Jackson, Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler, Pierce, Buchanan, and
Johnson had been senators; while John Adams, Jefferson and Van Buren held the Vice-Presidency
just before their elevation by election to the higher office. The custom of succession from
the one office to the other, which prevailed in the earlier years of the Republic, was broken
when Madison was preferred to George Clinton in 1808; and was revived only in the single instance
of Van Buren, whom the irresistible will of Jackson imposed upon the Democrats as his successor.
Washington, before becoming President, had held the office of President of the Constitutional
Convention. Polk had only served in the lower House of Congress, over which he had presided
as speaker. Neither Taylor nor Grant ever held a state or national office before being raised
to the Executive Chair. Lincoln had served a few years, with but little distinction, in the
national House of Representatives. The same may be said of Hayes, and of Fillmore before he
was chosen Vice-President.

[Sidenote: Presidents Contributed by the Various States.]

Virginia has had five Presidents, four of them having served in the first quarter of a century
of the national existence. Tennessee has had three; Ohio, three; Massachusetts, two; New York,
four; Illinois, two; and New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana, each one. But Harrison,
though elected from Ohio, and Taylor, elected from Louisiana, were both born in Virginia; and
Lincoln, elected from Illinois, was born in Kentucky. Therefore Virginia gave birth to seven
of the Presidents. In point of years, the ages of the Presidents have ranged from sixty-eight,
which was Harrison's age on his accession, to forty-six, which was Grant's age when he became
President; the average age being about fifty-seven.

MATERIAL PROGRESS.

[Sidenote: A Twofold Progress.]

It is manifestly impossible to give, within the brief scope of this volume, more than a hint
of the elements which have entered into and stimulated the material progress of the United
States during the past century. That progress may be said to have been twofold; the progress
which we have shared in common with the civilized world, and the progress which has been peculiar
to ourselves. The agency which invention and discovery have had in our advancement scarcely
needs to be pointed out. We have only to look around us, and remember the origin of many of
the comforts, conveniences, luxuries, nay even what we now regard as necessities, that surround
us and minister to our existence, in order to comprehend how very vast, how much beyond easy
calculation, the material progress of the century has been.

[Sidenote: Modern Comforts.]

Every hour of the day, should you stop to reflect, you would find yourself doing something,
or aided by something, unknown to or unused by the generation of 1776. Sitting in your parlor
or library, your feet rest upon carpets, which were introduced into American households in
1792; the book you are reading--which has far better paper, print, binding and illustration
than the old copy of "Pilgrim's Progress" which your great-grandfather used to read--is lighted
by gas, which did not come into use till this century was well on its way; and that gas you
have lit by a friction match, an affair of marvellous simplicity, which was unknown till after
1830.

[Sidenote: Improvement in Dress.]

You are writing, perhaps, with a steel pen; the Declaration of Independence was signed with
quills. It is, possibly, a rainy day. You put on rubbers, and you carry an umbrella. The men
of '76 had to do as best they could without either. You burn coal in a furnace or stove; they
must fain have warmed themselves with more cheery but less warming wood, in an open fireplace.
Every article of your dress is an improvement in convenience and comfort on those worn by Washington
in all his Presidential glory.

[Sidenote: Rapidity of Transit.]

Your walls are hung with photographs; your wife or daughter has a sewing-machine. In the kitchen
are endless contrivances which our great- grandmothers would have greeted with speechless astonishment.
You can order a case of goods from Hong Kong on Monday, and be told that they are ready for
shipping on Thursday. You can go to San Francisco in almost the same time that it took, only
fifty years ago, to reach Washington from New York. When General Jackson went to the capital
to be President, he could travel no faster than did the Jews, after the captivity, from Babylon
to Jerusalem.

[Sidenote: Material Growth.]

[Sidenote: Population.]

Taking a broader view--for we might go on with the material details of progress all about us
ad infinitum, did patience and strength hold out--we look abroad over the land, and note the
great elements of a progress peculiarly American, in the growth and distribution of population,
in manufactures, agriculture, and commerce. Each and all have been incalculably aided by perpetual
invention. A few leading facts must suffice to show that our orators, in their most daring
flights, can scarcely exaggerate the marvels of our material advance. The population of this
country in 1776, including slaves, was about two and three quarters millions. In 1886, it is
without doubt more than fifty millions. In 1790, when the first census was taken, the figure
was a little less than four millions. A notable circumstance in reference to the movement of
our population has been the increase of the proportion of dwellers in our cities to those in
the rural districts. In 1790, only one-thirtieth of our population inhabited the cities. In
1886, probably nearly one-fourth are included in the cities.

In 1790 there were but six cities with a population of more than eight thousand each. These
were: Philadelphia, with about 42,500; New York, with about 33,000; Boston. with about 18,000;
Charleston, with about 16,300: Baltimore, with about 13,500; and Salem, with a little over
8000. The total was about 131,500. Now the aggregate of our urban population is, probably,
at least 12,000,000. It may be added that the centre of our population has shifted from a few
miles east of Baltimore, where it was in 1790, to about eight miles west by south from Cincinnati,
where it is now supposed to be.

[Sidenote: Agriculture.]

The earliest avocation of our colonies was that of agriculture; and before 1776 our agricultural
industries, owing to the discoveries which had gradually been made as to the capabilities of
the then settled districts, had grown to important proportions. It needs but a glance at the
map to observe over what a vast area agricultural enterprise has spread since 1790. We may
fairly say that invention and improvement, in the application of chemistry and mechanical discovery
to the cultivation of land, have kept pace with the territorial advance of agricultural science.
There can scarcely be named a farming operation which is not performed by instruments far more
perfect, and with a rapidity far greater, than was possible with our ancestors.

[Sidenote: Cheaper Tools.]

Human labor has been greatly lessened in proportion to the results obtained. Tools are cheaper;
and whereas they were formerly made, to a large extent, on the farms themselves, they are now
perfected in factories supplied with the most efficient machinery. There were in 1880 two thousand
establishments for the manufacture of agricultural implements, with an annual production valued
at over $68,000,000. It would take up too much space to give even a list of these implements;
suffice it to say that it is calculated that the value of those now in use on American farms
is at least $500,000,000. A hundred years ago a man could only manage six bushels of grain
a day--cutting, binding and stocking, threshing and cleaning it. Now, with the aid of mechanical
appliances, a single man's labor can achieve almost eight times as much.

[Sidenote: Advance of Agricultural Arts]

To machinery must be added the advance in the arts of manuring, draining, irrigation, and of
grafting and obtaining greater varieties of fruits and vegetables. The improvement in breeding
and raising live-stock must not be omitted. In this product the wealth of the country was at
least $2,000,000.000 in 1880.

[Sidenote: First Mills.]

Great as has been our progress in agriculture, it is scarcely so remarkable as that in manufactures.
In 1776 we were mostly a farming community. Now, in New England at least, to a large extent
in the Middle States, and to some degree in the West and South, manufactures have outstripped
the farming industry. Manufacturing necessarily began, indeed, very early in the settlement
of the country; for ships had to be built, and were built, soon after the colonization of Plymouth
and Boston. The first saw-mill was erected at Salmon Falls as early as 1635. A printing-press
was set up at Cambridge in 1638, and a book-bindery in 1663. The first fulling-mill for making
cloth was started at Rowley in 1643. Iron manufacture was regularly established at Lynn in
1645. The first successful cotton-mill in the United States was started by Samuel Slater at
Providence in 1793.

 Colonies of artists swarm in stately buildings in New York,
Boston, and Philadelphia. The time has come when no artist of merit need starve for want of
patronage.

Thousands of Americans, travelling abroad every year, spend the larger portion of their time
in Europe in visiting those splendid art galleries which the munificence and taste of kings
and nobles have established, and which are free to all the world. The taste for art has become
universal, and has penetrated all classes; few are the American houses, in these days, wherein
the evidences of this taste are not apparent.

[Sidenote: Music.]

Music has progressed with the other arts in popularity and culture; though America, like England,
has as yet produced no really great composer. Every branch of music, however, is cultivated
with us; and music as a profession is even more certainly lucrative than painting. America
welcomes the most renowned singers and musicians in the world, and the highest efforts of musical
composition are performed here to audiences sufficiently cultivated fully to enjoy and appreciate
them. We cannot doubt that the future will still further develop the American love of all the
arts; or that, in time, this continent will rival that of Europe in great artistic productions.

PROGRESS IN SCIENCE AND INVENTION.

[Sidenote: The Patent Office.]

The progress in practical science and invention, in this country and the civilized world, has
been so amazingly rapid during the present century, that the merest hint of a few of the most
important elements of that progress can alone be given. The fertility of the human intellect,
in devising quicker and more exact methods of doing those things which contribute to the wealth
and the pleasure of man, has accomplished results so vast and so varied since the Declaration
of Independence, that the mind cannot survey the smallest portion of this field without bewilderment
and wonder. Sciences and Amount are carried jongkind they proved.

[Sidenote: Improvements in Machines and Methods.]

We can look in no direction, however, without at once in some degree appreciating, and being
astonished at, the metamorphosis which has been effected by the activity of scientific invention
and discovery of the most palpably practical kind. No practical profession, trade, or industry
can be named in which the improvements in machinery and methods have not been such, within
the century, as to alter most of its conditions, and very greatly to multiply its efficiency
and productiveness. These improvements have descended, too, from general systems to the minutest
details. Cloth fabrics are not only manufactured on a very different scale and extent, but
every little appliance of the machinery has been made better, and does its appointed work faster
and with greater precision.
