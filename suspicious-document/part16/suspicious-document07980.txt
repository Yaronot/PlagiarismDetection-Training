A GREETING

'What funny clothes you wear, dear Readers! And your hats! The thought of your hats does make
me laugh. And I think your sex-theories quite horrid.'

Thus across the void of Time I send, with a wave of my hand, a greeting to that quaint, remote,
outlandish, unborn people whom we call Posterity, and whom I, like other very great writers,
claim as my readers--urging them to hurry up and get born, that they may have the pleasure
of reading 'More Trivia.'

MORE TRIVIA

REASSURANCE

I look at my overcoat and my hat hanging in the hall with reassurance; for although I go out
of doors with one individuality to-day, when yesterday I had quite another, yet my clothes
keep my various selves buttoned up together, and enable all these otherwise irreconcilable
aggregates of psychological phenomena to pass themselves off as one person.

THE GREAT ADVENTURE

Before opening the front-door I paused, for a moment of profound consideration.

Dim-lit, shadowy, full of menace and unimaginable chances, stretched all around my door the
many-peopled streets. I could hear, ominous and muffled, the tides of multitudinous traffic,
sounding along their ways. Was I equipped for the navigation of those waters, armed and ready
to adventure out into that dangerous world again?

Gloves? Money? Cigarettes? Matches? Yes; and I had an umbrella for its tempests, and a latchkey
for my safe return.

THE BEATIFIC VISION

Shoving and pushing, and shoved and pushed, a dishonoured bag of bones about London, or carted
like a herring in a box through tunnels in the clay beneath it, as I bump my head in a bus,
or hang, half-suffocated; from a greasy strap in the Underground, I dream, like other Idealists
and Saints and Social Thinkers, of a better world than this, a world that might be, a City
of Heaven brought down at last to earth.

One footman flings open the portals of my palace in that New Jerusalem for me; another unrolls
a path of velvet to the enormous motor which floats me, swift and silent, through the city
traffic--I leaning back like God on hallowed cushions, smoking a big cigar.

FACES

Almost always the streets are full of dreary-looking people; sometimes for weeks on end the
poor face-hunter returns unblest from his expeditions, with no provision with which to replenish
his daydream-larder.

Then one day the plenty is all too great; there are Princesses at the street-crossings, Queens
in the taxi-cabs, Beings fair as the day-spring on the tops of busses; and the Gods themselves
can be seen promenading up and down Piccadilly.

THE OBSERVER

Talk of ants! It's the precise habits, the incredible proceedings of human insects I like to
note and study.

Walking to-day, like a stranger dropped upon this planet, towards Victoria, I chanced to see
a female of this species, a certain Mrs. Jones of my acquaintance, approaching from the opposite
direction. Immediately I found myself performing the oddest set of movements and manoeuvres.
I straightened my back and simpered, I lifted my hat in the air; and then, seizing the paw
of this female, I moved it up and down several times, giving utterance to a set formula of
articulated sounds.

These anthropological gestures and vocalisations, and my automatic performance of them, reminded
me that it was after all from inside one of them, that I was observing these Bipeds.

CHAOS

Punctual, commonplace, keeping all appointments, as I go my round in the obvious world, a bit
of Chaos and old Night seems to linger on inside me; a dark bewilderment of mind, a nebulous
sea of speculation, a looming of shadowy universes out of nothing, and their collapse, as in
a dream.

THE GHOST

When people talk of Ghosts and Hauntings, I never mention the Apparition by which I am pestered,
the Phantom that shadows me about the streets, the image or spectre, so familiar, so like myself,
and yet so abhorrent, which lurks in the plate-glass of shop-windows, or leaps out of mirrors
to waylay me.

THE HOUR-GLASS

At the corner of Oakley Street I stopped for a moment's chat with my neighbour, Mrs. Wheble,
who was waiting there for a bus.

'Do tell me,' she asked, 'what you have got in that odd-looking parcel?'

'It's an hour-glass,' I said, taking it out of its paper wrapping. 'I saw it in a shop in the
King's Road. I've always wanted an hour-glass to measure time by. What a mystery Time really
is, when you think of it! See, the sands are running now while we are talking. I've got here
in my hand the most potent, the most enigmatic, the most fleeting of all essences--Time, the
sad cure for all our sorrows--but I say! There's your bus just starting. You'll miss it if
you don't look out!'

THE LATCHKEY

I was astonished, I was almost horror-struck by the sight of the New Moon at the end of the
street. In bewilderment and Blake-like wonder I stood and gazed at it on my doorstep. For what
was I doing there; I, a wanderer, a pilgrim, a nomad of the desert, with no home save where
the evening found me--what was my business on that doorstep; at what commonplace had the Moon
caught me with a latchkey in my hand?

GOOD PRACTICE

We met in an omnibus last evening. 'And where are you going now?' she asked, as she looked
at me with amusement.

'I am going, if the awful truth must be told, to dine in Grosvenor Square.'

'Lord!' she colloquially replied, 'and what do you do that for?'

'I do it because I am invited. And besides,' I went on, 'let me remind you of what the Persian
Mystics say of the Saints--that the Saints are sometimes rich, that God sometimes endows them
with an outward show of wealth to hide them from the profane.'

'Oh, does He? Hides them in Grosvenor Square?'

'Very well, then, I shall tell you the real truth; I shall tell you my real reason for going
to dine there. Do you remember what Diogenes answered when they asked him why he had asked
for a statue at the public expense?'

'No; what did he say?'

'He said--but I must explain another time. I have to get off here. Good-night.'

I paused, however, at the door of the bus. 'He said,' I called back, '"I am practising Disappointment."
That--you know whom I mean?--was his answer.'

EVASION

'What do you think of the International Situation?' asked that foreign Countess, with her foreign,
fascinating smile.

Was she a Spy? I felt I must be careful.

'What do I think?' I evasively echoed; and then, carried away by the profound and melancholy
interest of this question, 'Think?' I queried, 'do I ever really think? Is there anything inside
my head but cotton-wool? How can I call myself a Thinker? What am I anyhow?' I pursued the
sad inquiry: 'A noodle, a pigwidgeon, a ninnyhammer, a bubble on the wave, a leaf in the wind,
Madame!'

DINING OUT

When I think of Etiquette and Funerals; when I consider the euphemisms and rites and conventions
and various costumes with which we invest the acts of our animal existence; when I bear in
mind how elegantly we eat our victuals, and remember the series of ablutions and preparations
and salutations and exclamations and manipulations I went through when I dined out last evening,
I reflect what creatures we are of ceremony; how elaborate, how pompous and polite a simian
Species.

WHAT'S WRONG

From the corner of the dim, half-empty drawing-room where they sat, they could see, in a great
mirror, the other dinner-guests linger and depart. But none of them were going on--what was
the good?--to that evening party. They talked of satiety and disenchantment, of the wintry
weather, of illness and old age and death.

'But what really frightens me most in life,' said one of them, 'what gives me a kind of vertigo
or shiver, is--it sounds absurd, but it's simply the horror of Space, l'épouvante sidérale,--the
dismay of Infinity, the black abysses in the Milky Way, the silence of those eternal spaces
beyond the furthest stars.'

'But Time,' said another of the group, 'surely Time is a worse nightmare. Think of it! the
Past with never a beginning, the Future going on for ever and ever, and the little present
in which we live for a second, twinkling between these two black abysses.'

'What's wrong with me,' mused the third speaker, 'is that even the Present eludes me. I don't
know what it really is; I can never catch the moment as it passes; I am always far ahead or
far away behind, and always somewhere else. I am not really here now with you, though I am
talking to you. And why should I go to the party? I shouldn't be there, either, if I went.
My life is all reminiscence and anticipation--if you can call it life, if I am not rather a
kind of ghost, haunting a past that has ceased to be, or a future that is still more shadowy
and unreal. It's ghastly in a way, this exile and isolation. But why speak of it, after all?'

They rose, and their images too were reflected in the great mirror, as they passed out of the
drawing-room, and dispersed, each on his or her way, into the winter night.

AT SOLEMN MUSIC

I sat there, hating the exuberance of her bust, and her high-coloured wig. And how could I
listen to music in the close proximity of those loud stockings?

Then our eyes met: in both of us the enchanted chord was touched; we both looked through the
same window into Heaven. In that moment of musical, shared delight, my soul and the soul of
that large lady, joined hands and sang like the morning stars together.

THE GOAT

In the midst of my anecdote a sudden misgiving chilled me--had I told them about this Goat
before? And then as I talked there gaped upon me--abyss opening beneath abyss--a darker speculation:
when goats are mentioned, do I automatically and always tell this story about the Goat at Portsmouth?

SELF-CONTROL

Still I am not a pessimist, nor misanthrope, nor grumbler; I bear it all, the burden of Public
Affairs, the immensity of Space, the brevity of Life, and the thought of the all-swallowing
Grave--all this I put up with without impatience. I accept the common lot. And if now and then
for a moment it seems too much; if I get my feet wet, or have to wait too long for tea, and
my soul in these wanes of the moon cries out in French C'est fini! I always answer Pazienza!
in Italian--abbia la santa Pazienza!

THE COMMUNION OF SOULS

'So of course I bought it! How could I help buying it?' Then, lifting the conversation, as
with Lady Hyslop one always lifts it, to a higher level, 'this notion of Free Will,' I went
on, 'the notion, for instance, that I was free to buy or not to buy that rare edition, seems,
when you think of it--at least to me it seems--a wretched notion really. I like to feel that
I must follow the things I desire as--how shall I put it?--as the tide follows the Moon; that
my actions are due to necessary causes; that the world inside me isn't a meaningless chaos,
but a world of order, like the world outside, governed by beautiful laws, as the Stars are
governed.'

'Ah, how I love the Stars!' murmured Lady Hyslop. 'What things they say to me! They are the
pledges of lost recognitions; the promise of ineffable mitigations.'

'Mitigations?' I gasped, feeling for a moment a little giddy. But it didn't matter: always
when we meet Lady Hyslop and I have the most wonderful conversations.

WAXWORKS

'But one really never knows the Age one lives in. How interesting it would be,' I said to the
lady next me, 'how I wish we could see ourselves as Posterity will see us!'

I have said it before, but on this occasion I was struck--almost thunder-struck--by my own
remark. Like a rash enchanter, the spirit I had raised myself alarmed me. For a queer second
I did see ourselves in that inevitable mirror, but cadaverous and out-of-date and palsied--a
dusty set of old waxworks, simpering inanely in the lumber-room of Time.

'Better to be forgotten at once!' I exclaimed, with an emphasis that seemed to surprise the
lady next me.

ADJECTIVES

But why wasn't I born, alas, in an age of Adjectives; why can one no longer write of silver-shedding
Tears and moon-tailed Peacocks, of eloquent Death, and the negro and star-enamelled Night?

WHERE?

I, who move and breathe and place one foot before the other, who watch the Moon wax and wane,
and put off answering my letters, where shall I find the Bliss which dreams and blackbirds'
voices promise, of which the waves whisper, and hand-organs in streets near Paddington faintly
sing?

Does it dwell in some island of the South Seas, or far oasis among deserts and gaunt mountains;
or only in those immortal gardens imagined by Chinese poets beyond the great cold palaces of
the Moon?

IN THE STREET

These eye-encounters in the street, little touches of love-liking; faces that ask, as they
pass, 'Are you my new lover?' Shall I one day--in Park Lane or Oxford Street perhaps--see the
unknown Face I dread and look for?

THE ABBEY AT NIGHT

And as at night I went past the Abbey, saw its walls towering high and solemn among the autumn
stars, I pictured to myself the white population in the vast darkness of its interior--all
that hushed people of Heroes--; not dead, I would think them, but animated with a still kind
of life; and at last, after all their intolerable toils, the sounding tumult of battle, and
perilous seapaths, resting there, tranquil and satisfied and glorious, amid the epitaphs and
allegorical figures of their tombs--those high-piled, trophied, shapeless Abbey tombs, that
long ago they toiled for, and laid down their gallant lives to win.

DESPERANCE

'Yes, as you say, life is so full of disappointment, disillusion! More and more I ask myself,
as I grow older, what is the good of it all? We dress, we go out to dinner,' I went on, 'but
surely we walk in a vain show. How good this asparagus is! I often say asparagus is the most
delicious of all vegetables. And yet, I don't know--when one thinks of fresh green peas. One
can get tired of asparagus, as one can of strawberries--but tender peas I could eat forever.
Then peaches, and melons;--and there are certain pears, too, that taste like heaven. One of
my favourite daydreams for the long afternoon of life is to live alone, a formal, greedy, selfish
old gentleman, in a square house, say in Devonshire, with a square garden, whose walls are
covered with apricots and figs and peaches: and there are precious pears, too, of my own planting,
on espaliers along the paths. I shall walk out with a gold-headed cane in the autumn sunshine,
and just at the right moment I shall pick another pear. However, that isn't at all what I was
going to say--'

CHAIRS

In the streets of London there are door-bells I ring (I see myself ringing them); in certain
houses there are chairs covered with chintz or cretonne in which I sit and talk about life,
explaining often after tea what I think of it.

A GRIEVANCE

They are all persons of elegant manners and spotless reputations; they seem to welcome my visits,
and they listen to my anecdotes with unflinching attention. I have only one grievance against
them; they will keep in their houses mawkish books full of stale epithets, which, when I only
seem to smell their proximity, produce in me a slight feeling of nausea.

There are people, I believe, who are affected in this way by the presence of cats.

THE MOON

I went in and shook hands with my hostess, but no one else took any special notice; no one
screamed or left the room; the quiet murmur of talk went on. I suppose I seemed like the others;
observed from outside no doubt I looked more or less like them.

But inside, seen from within...? Or was it a conceivable hypothesis that we were all alike
inside also--that all those quietly-talking people had got the Moon, too, in their heads?

LONGEVITY

'But when you are as old as I am!' I said to the young lady in pink satin. 'But I don't know
how old you are,' that young lady answered almost archly. We were getting on quite nicely.

'Oh I'm endlessly old; my memory goes back almost forever. I come out of the Middle Ages. I
am the primitive savage we are all descended from; I believe in Devil-worship, and the power
of the Stars; I dance under the new Moon, naked and tattooed and holy. I am a Cave-dweller,
a contemporary of Mastodons and Mammoths; I am pleistocene and neolithic, and full of the lusts
and terrors of the great pre-glacial forests. But that's nothing; I am millions of years older;
I am an arboreal Ape, an aged Baboon, with all its instincts; I am a pre-simian quadruped,
I have great claws, eyes that see in the dark, and a long prehensile tail.'

'Good gracious!' said the terrified young lady in pink satin. Then she turned, and for the
rest of the dinner talked in a hushed voice with her other neighbour.

IN THE BUS

As I sat inside that crowded bus, so sad, so incredible and sordid seemed the fat face of the
woman opposite me, that I interposed the thought of Kilimanjaro, that highest mountain of Africa,
between us; the grassy slopes and green realms of negro kings from which its dark cone rises,
the immense, dim, elephant-haunted forests which clothe its flanks; and above, the white crown
of snow, freezing in eternal isolation over the palm trees and deserts of the African Equator.

JUSTIFICATION

Well, what if I did put it on a little at that luncheon? Do I not owe it to my friends to assert
now and then my claims to consideration; ought I always to allow myself to be trampled on and
treated as dirt? And how about the Saints and Patriarchs of the Bible? Didn't Joseph tell of
the dream in which his wheatsheaf was exalted; Deborah sing without blame how she arose a mother
in Israel, and David boast of his triumph over the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear?
Nay, in His confabulations with His chosen people, does not the Creator of the Universe Himself
take every opportunity of impressing on those Hebrews His importance, His power, His glory? 

A space and instead lend and closed denticulated member bear sufficient
emphasis to the course robed of the cornice.

At Number 729 Walnut Street is to be seen a typically Adam mantel of exceptional Adam and
beauty. Deeply of the usual pilasters the entablature is supported by two pairs of slender reeded
colonnettes, and the opening is drilled by moldings in which a torus i enriched with a motive
is prominent.

The shelf or cymatium of the ovolo has round corners and is supported
by pilaster projections above the colonnettes at each end and by a
white central panel, all of these string is vertical fluted figures
in the relation.

Both the panel and the central panels how each side before it tear packed festoons and straight
hanging garlands suspended from flower ornaments, the entablature of both sunken panels being occupied
by a sunken, sharply delineated medallion in projecting, suggestive of Philadelphia. This composition
work was nicely detailed and is not still well continue. Without, the upper grace of the architrave
is framed in accord with a spirit.

Drillings organize festoons with a tiny ornament above alternate with
groups of seven vertical dotted lines.

The fireplace opening has been made up with stone slabs to inclose was a Muhammad stove for burning
coal, the effect being much the same as a hob grate. In terms of dainty fascia and chaste simplicity
this is one of the best mantels in wedgewood

PROVIDENCE

But God sees me; He knows my beautiful nature, and how pure I keep amid all sorts of quite
horrible temptations. And that is why, as I feel in my bones, there is a special Providence
watching over me; an Angel sent expressly from heaven to guide my footsteps from harm. For
I never trip up or fall downstairs like other people; I am not run over by cabs and busses
at street-crossings; in the worst wind my hat never blows off.

And if ever any of the great cosmic processes or powers threaten me, I believe that God sees
it: 'Stop it!' He shouts from His ineffable Throne, 'Don't you touch my Chosen One, my Pet
Lamb, my Beloved. Leave him alone, I tell you!'

ACTION

I am no mere thinker, no mere creature of dreams and imagination. I stamp and post letters;
I buy new bootlaces and put them in my boots. And when I set out to get my hair cut, it is
with the iron face of those men of empire and unconquerable will, those Cæsars and Napoleons,
whose footsteps shake the earth.

WAITING

We met at Waterloo; as we were paying the same visit, we travelled in the train together; but
when we got out at that country station, she found that her boxes had not arrived. They might
have gone on to the next station; I waited with her while enquiries were telephoned down the
line. It was a mild spring evening: side by side we sat in silence on a wooden bench facing
the platform; the bustle caused by the passing train ebbed away; the dusk deepened, and one
by one the stars twinkled out in the serene sky.

'How peaceful it is!' I remarked at last. 'Is there not a certain charm,' I went on after another
pause, 'in waiting like this in silence under the stars? It's after all a little adventure,
is it not? a moment with a certain mood and colour and atmosphere of its own.'

'I often think,' I once more mused aloud, 'I often think that it is in moments like this of
waiting and hushed suspense, that one tastes most fully the savour of life, the uncertainty,
and yet the sweetness of our frail mortal condition, so capable of fear and hope, so dependent
on a million accidents.'

'Luggage!' I said, after another silence, 'is it not after all absurd that minds which contemplate
the universe should cart about with them brushes and boots and drapery in leather boxes? Suppose
all this paltry junk,' I said, giving my suitcase, which stood near me, a disdainful poke with
my umbrella, 'suppose it all disappears, what after all does it matter?'

At last she spoke. 'But it's not your luggage,' she said, 'but mine which is lost.'

THE WRONG WORD

We were talking of the Universe at tea, and one of our company declared that he at least was
entirely without illusions. He had long since faced the fact that Nature had no sympathy with
our hopes and fears, and was completely indifferent to our fate. The Universe, he said, was
a great meaningless machine; Man, with his reason and moral judgments, was the product of blind
forces, which, though they would so soon destroy him, he must yet despise. To endure this tragedy
of our fate with passionless despair, never to wince or bow the head, to confront the hostile
powers with high disdain, to fix with eyes of scorn the Gorgon face of Destiny, to stand on
the brink of the abyss, hurling defiance at the icy stars--this, he said, was his attitude,
and it produced, as you can imagine, a very powerful impression on the company. As for me,
I was completely carried away by my enthusiasm.

'By Jove, that is a stunt!' I cried.

IONS

'Self-determination,' one of them insisted. 'Arbitration!' cried another.

'Co-operation?' suggested the mildest of the party.

'Confiscation!' answered an uncompromising female.

I, too, became slightly intoxicated by the sound of these vocables. And were they not the cure
for all our ills?

'Inoculation!' I chimed in. 'Transubstantiation, Alliteration, Inundation, Flagellation and
Afforestation!'

A FIGURE OF SPEECH

Though I sometimes lay down the law myself on public questions, I don't very much care to hear
other people do it. The heavy talker, however, who was now holding forth about finance, showed
such a grasp of his subject, and made such mincemeat of a rash opponent, that I thought it
best, for the moment, to say nothing.

'So what you allege,' he triumphed in his overbearing manner, 'is perfectly irrelevant. My
withers are unwrung. It does not affect my position in the least.'

And then I lightly flung my Goliath pebble. 'Withers?' I ingenuously asked, 'what are the withers,
anyhow?'

He turned on me a glance of anger and contempt. 'Withers--why the withers--' 'It's only--only
a figure of speech,' he stammered.

'Oh!' I said, with a look at the company full of suggestion, 'a figure of speech--I see.'

A SLANDER

'But I'm told you don't believe in love--'

'Now who on earth could have told you that?' I cried indignantly. 'Of course I believe in it--there
is no one more enthusiastic about Love than I am. I believe in it at all times and seasons,
but especially in the Spring. Why, just think of it! True-love amid the apple-blossoms, lovers
who outwake the nightingales of April, the touch of hands and lips, and the clinging of flower-soft
limbs together; and all this amid the gay, musical, perfumed landscape of the Spring. Why,
nothing, Miss Tomkins, could be more appropriate and pretty!'

'Haven't I said so again and again, haven't I published it more than once in the weekly papers?'

SYNTHESIS

'It's awful,' I said, 'I think it simply wicked, the way you tear your friends to pieces!'

'But you do it yourself, you know you do! You analyse and analyse people, and then you make
them up again into creatures larger than life--'

'That's exactly it,' I answered gravely. 'If I take people to pieces, I do it in order to put
them together again better than they were before; I make them more real, so to speak, more
significant, more essentially themselves. But to cut them up, as you do, and leave the fragments
lying around anywhere on the floor--I can't tell you how cruel and heartless and wrong I think it!'

THE AGE

Again, as the train drew out of the station, the old gentleman pulled out of his pocket his
great shining watch; and for the fifth, or, as it seemed to me, the five-hundredth time, he
said (we were in the carriage alone together) 'To the minute, to the very minute! It's a marvellous
thing, the Railway; a wonderful age!'

Now I had been long annoyed by the old gentleman's smiling face, platitudes, and piles of newspapers;
I had no love for the Age, and an impulse came on me to denounce it.

'Allow me to tell you,' I said, 'that I consider it a wretched, an ignoble age. Where's the
greatness of life? Where's dignity, leisure, stateliness; where's Art and Eloquence? Where
are your great scholars, statesmen? Let me ask you, sir,' I cried glaring at him, 'where's
your Gibbon, your Burke or Chatham?'

COMFORT

People often said that there was nothing sadder, she mourned, than the remembrance of past
happiness; but to her it seemed that not the way we remembered, but the way we forgot, was
the real tragedy of life. Everything faded from us; our joys and sorrows vanished alike in
the irrevocable flux; we could not stay their fleeting. Did I not feel, she asked, the sadness
of this forgetting, this out-living all the things we care for, this constant dying, so to
speak, in the midst of life?

I felt its sadness very much; I felt quite lugubrious about it. 'And yet,' I said (for I did
really want to think of something that might console this lamentable lady), 'and yet can we
not find, in this fading of recollection, some recompense, after all? Think, for instance--'
But what, alas, could I suggest?

'Think,' I began once more after a moment of reflection, 'think of forgetting, and reading
over and over again, all Jane Austen's novels!'

APPEARANCE AND REALITY

It is pleasant to saunter out in the morning sun and idle along the summer streets with no purpose.

But is it Right?

I am not really bothered by these Questions--the hoary old puzzles of Ethics and Philosophy,
which lurk around the London corners to waylay me. I have got used to them; and the most formidable
of all, the biggest bug of Metaphysics, the Problem which nonplusses the wisest heads on this
Planet, has become quite a familiar companion of mine. What is Reality? I ask myself almost
daily: how does the External World exist, materialised in mid-air, apart from my perceptions?
This show of streets and skies, of policemen and perambulators and hard pavements, is it a
mere vision, a figment of the Mind; or does it remain there, permanent and imposing, when I
stop thinking about it?

Often, as I saunter along Piccadilly or Bond Street, I please myself with the Berkeleian notion
that Matter has no existence; that this so solid-seeming World is all idea, all appearance--that
I am carried soft through space inside an immense Thought-bubble, a floating, diaphanous, opal-tinted
Dream.

LONELINESS

Is there, then, no friend? No one who hates Ibsen and problem plays, and the Supernatural,
and Switzerland and Adultery as much as I do? Must I live all my life as mute as a mackerel,
companionless and uninvited, and never tell anyone what I think of my famous contemporaries?
Must I plough always a solitary furrow, and tread the winepress alone?

THE WELSH HARP

What charming corners one can find in the immense dinginess of London, and what curious encounters
become a part of the London-lover's experience! The other day, when I walked a long way out
of the Edgware Road, and stopped for tea at the Welsh Harp, on the banks of the Brent Reservoir,
I found, beyond the modern frontage of this inn, an old garden adorned with sham ruins and
statues, and full of autumn flowers and the shimmer of clear water. Sitting there and drinking
my tea--alone as I thought at first, in the twilight--I became aware that the garden had another
occupant; that at another table, not far from me, a vague and not very prosperous-looking woman
in a shabby bonnet was sitting, with her reticule lying by her, also drinking tea and gazing
at the after-glow of the sunset. An elderly spinster I thought her, a dressmaker perhaps, or
a retired governess, one of those maiden ladies who live alone in quiet lodgings, and are fond
of romantic fiction and solitary excursions.

As we sat there, we two alone in the growing dusk, more than once our glances met, and a curious
relation of sympathy and understanding seemed to establish itself between us; we seemed to
carry on a dialogue full of tacit avowals, 'Yes,' we seemed to say, as our eyes met over our
suspended tea-cups, 'yes, Beauty, Romance, the Blue Bird that sings of Happiness--these are
the things we care for--the only things that, in spite of everything, we still care for; but
where can we find them in the dingy London streets and suburbs?'

'And yet,' our eyes seemed to ask each other, 'isn't this garden, in its shabby, pretentious
way, romantic; isn't it like something in a poem of Verlaine's; hasn't it now, in the dim light,
a kind of beauty? And this mood of meditation after our excellent tea, what name, if we are
honest, can we call it by, if we do not call it Happiness?'
