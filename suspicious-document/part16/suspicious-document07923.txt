PREFACE.

There appears to be much needed a work on parliamentary law, based, in its general principles,
upon the rules and practice of Congress, and adapted, in its details, to the use of ordinary
societies.  Such a work should give, not only the methods of organizing and conducting the
meetings, the duties of the officers and the names of the ordinary motions, but in addition,
should state in a systematic manner, in reference to each motion, its object and effect; whether
it can be amended or debated; if debatable, the extent to which it opens the main question
to debate; the circumstances under which it can be made, and what other motions can be made
while it is pending.  This Manual has been prepared with a view to supplying the above information
in a condensed and systematic manner, each rule being either complete in itself, or giving
references to every section that in any way qualifies it, so that a stranger to the work can
refer to any special subject with safety.

To aid in quickly referring to as many as possible of the rules relating to each motion, there
is placed immediately before the Index, a Table of Rules, which enables one, without turning
a page, to find the answers to some two hundred questions.  The Table of Rules is so arranged
as to greatly assist the reader in systematizing his knowledge of parliamentary law.

The second part is a simple explanation of the common methods of conducting business in ordinary

meetings, in which the motions are classified according to their uses, and those used for a
similar purpose compared together. 

The captain felt a certain good will for the honest journeymen. "Take," he called in a strange
mood and held out his full bag of Uri. This took him with his right hand and left the counting
gold pieces slide into the left, serious and thoughtful. Then he pushed the ducats in his pocket
and tried to make the bag the general.

"Remember! He has golden loops!"

The Uri sent to the purse the ducats. "Where your Stellet me in, sir?" he asked. He could think
of nothing except that it advertised Pescara and earnest money if he did.

Pescara replied: "I have not hired you, and I mean, after the dreie up as serious admonished, have
you come back the best in your home and nourish you shall be as the saying goes. "

"But why should you give me so much money, where I have done nothing
for the sake of you?" asked Zgraggen.

But much suffering, "he added in thought. These retaliatory Pescara exceeded the capacity of
the Urner and frightened his honesty.

"From generosity," joked the general.

Bläsi did not know the word. Then he remembered that it would mean boast, and he in the camp
was often seen as bragging throwing away money with both hands, he calmed down there. "Yes way," he
said. Pescara waved but to show off his horse.

"And so you can get away," the commander said, even in the temple, "take this yet" He threw Passiermarke
one, and little was missing, would have thanked Zgraggen. At least he wanted to long life do,
but the commander farewell look at, he recognized the infirmity in the face with his Alpine eyes,
which all the world's deceptive intellectual life of the same not bribed. Instinctively he
wished: "May God grant you blessed resurrection, Lord!" Then his own speech and their evil significance
dismay, he ran across country with his half-sticks, he carefully
removed, and now introduced as a travel rod.

The Spaniards had been watching in wonder, The old sergeant shook his head and superstitious
worrying about the strange Generosity of his low general. The squad, which Uri had caught one,
to the hordes who now approached in a cloud of dust behind the beating
drums.

The general rode to meet his brave, received by roaring cheers, and drove the horse between the field
and the first music company, whose captain was respectful space.

For a while he remained alone at the head of the troops. As approached
from a mounted in Novara white coat and joined him. Together they
rode through the castle gate. Silently followed the passage of the
companion of Pescara, and crossed the threshold of the room behind
him.

Pescara turned. "What do you want, Moncada?" he asked, and answered,
"A conversation without witnesses, you will not refuse me a second
time. "

They were hardly alone, as Fenice a brass lamp that stood side by the hearth, took and to hastily
ended. The stove fire was extinguished more and more, the three red flames of the Lamp lit
only a small part of the vast space. It seemed as though the darkness the stranger made sleepy,
as he sat at the table, his head on his arms, the coat drawn tightly around him, as he intended
to spend the night Sun. Then he heard his name call and looked up. The lamp was burning on
the table before him, he faced the young Padrona, who had called him. Her eyes met his with great
force.

"Filippo" she said, "You know me anymore?"

He saw some time researching into the beautiful face, by the light of the lamp, and even more
seemed to glow from the fear that would answer their question. The face was well worth the
re-remembering. The soft long eyelashes Soothes as it slowly and down went the severity of the
forehead and narrow-shaped nose. The mouth flourished in the reddest youth, only he had when
he was silent, a train of self-denial, pain and Savagery, which did not contradict the black
eyes.

Only now, as she stood at the table, there was also the austere charm
of form, especially the beauty of the neck and throat.

And yet, Filippo said, after some reflection:

"I know you truly do not Padrona!"

"It is not possible," she said with a wonderful deep tone of certainty.

"You have yes had seven years to keep me. This is long, there is a picture to remember already.

The
strange word it seemed only now completely free herself from his
peculiar ideas.

"Yes, girl," he said, "who takes seven years to do other things than a nice Maedchenkopf think
of the last to know it well by heart.

"

"Yes," she said thoughtfully, "it is as you said even then, that you otherwise would think. "

"Seven years ago? So I was a jocular man seven years ago. And you believed that serious? "

She nodded three times very seriously. "Why should not I? I have it on myself yes tell if your
right had. "

"Child," he said with a good-natured expression, which was his confident
trains well, "the I'm sorry.

Seven years ago, thought I probably have it there all the women were worried that affectionate
Maennerworte are not worth much more than gambling chips, which are indeed sometimes against
sounding money exchanged it, if it is identified explicitly. What I thought not all seven
years ago of you women! Now I think, frankly, rarely to you. Love
Child, you have to think so much more important. "

She was silent,
as if they did not understand it all and quietly wait until something
said what they really As for.

"It certainly is dawning in me," he
said after some reflection, "I want this part I wandered through the
mountains before. I would have perhaps the village and this House
recognized, without the fog. Yes, yes, but it was seven years ago,
where I The doctor sent into the mountains, and I like a fool, the
steepest paths stormed up and down. "
In England these customs and usages of Parliament form a part of the unwritten law of the land,
and in our own legislative bodies they are of authority in all cases where they do not conflict
with existing rules or precedents.

But as a people we have not the respect which the English have for customs and precedents,
and are always ready for innovations which we think are improvements, and hence changes have
been and are being constantly made in the written rules which our legislative bodies have found
best to adopt.  As each house adopts its own rules, it results that the two houses of the same
legislature do not always agree in their practice; even in Congress the order of precedence
of motions is not the same in both houses, and the Previous Question is admitted in the House
of Representatives, but not in the Senate.  As a consequence of this, the exact method of conducting
business in any particular

=== Page 10 ============================================================

legislative body is to be obtained only from the Legislative Manual of that body.

The vast number of societies, political, literary, scientific, benevolent and religious, formed
all over the land, though not legislative, are still deliberative in their character, and must
have some system of conducting business, and some rules to govern their proceedings, and are
necessarily subject to the common parliamentary law where it does not conflict with their own
special rules.  But as their knowledge of parliamentary law has been obtained from the usages
in this country, rather than from the customs of Parliament, it has resulted that these societies
have followed the customs of our own legislative bodies, and our people have thus been educated
under a system of parliamentary law which is peculiar to this country, and yet so well established
as to supersede the English parliamentary law as the common law of ordinary deliberative assemblies.

The practice of the National House of Representatives should have the same force in this country
as the usages of the House of Commons have in England, in determining the general principles
of the common parliamentary law of the land; but it does not follow that in every matter of
detail the rules of Congress can be appealed to as the common law governing every deliberative
assembly.  In these matters of detail, the rules of each House of Congress are adapted to their
own peculiar wants, and are of no force whatever in other assemblies.

=== Page 11 ============================================================

But upon all great parliamentary questions, such as what motions can be made, what is their
order of precedence, which can be debated, what is their effect, etc., the common law of the
land is settled by the practice of the U. S. House of Representatives, and not by that of the
English Parliament, the U. S. Senate, or any other body.

While in extreme cases there is no difficulty in deciding the question as to whether the practice
of Congress determines the common parliamentary law, yet between these extremes there must
necessarily be a large number of doubtful cases upon which there would be great difference
of opinion, and to avoid the serious difficulties always arising from a lack of definiteness
in the law, every deliberative assembly should imitate our legislative bodies in adopting Rules
of Order for the conduct of their business.* [Where the practice of Congress differs from that
of Parliament upon a material point, the common law of this country follows the practice of
Congress.  Thus in every American deliberative assembly having no rules for conducting business,
the motion to adjourn would be decided to be undebatable, as in Congress, the English parliamentary
law to the contrary notwithstanding; so if the Previous Question were negatived, the debate
upon the subject would continue as in Congress, whereas in Parliament the subject would be
immediately dismissed; so too the Previous Question could be moved when there was before the
assembly a motion either to amend, to commit, or to postpone definitely or indefinitely, just
as in Congress, notwithstanding that, according to English parliamentary law, the Previous
Question could not be moved under such circumstances. When the rules of the two Houses of Congress
conflict, the H. R. rules are of greater authority than those of the Senate in determining
the parliamentary law of the country, just as the practice of the House of Commons, and not
the House of Lords, determines the parliamentary law of England.  For instance, though the
Senate rules do not allow the motion for the Previous Question, and make the motion to postpone
indefinitely take precedence of every other subsidiary motion [§ 7] except to lie on the table,
yet the parliamentary law of the land follows the practice of the House of Representatives,
in recognizing the Previous Question as a legitimate motion, and assigning to the very lowest
rank the motion to postpone indefinitely.  But in matters of detail, the rules of the House
of Representatives are adapted to the peculiar wants of that body, and are of no authority
in any other assembly.  No one for instance would accept the following H. R. rules as common
parliamentary law in this country:  That the chairman, in case of disorderly conduct, would
have the power to order the galleries to be cleared; that the ballot could not be used in electing
the officers of an assembly; that any fifteen members would be authorized to compel the attendance
of absent members and make them pay the expenses of the messengers sent after them; that all
committees not appointed by the Chair would have to be appointed by ballot, and if the required
number were not elected by a majority vote, then a second ballot must be taken in which a plurality
of votes would prevail; that each member would be limited in debate upon any question, to one
hour; that a day's notice must be given of the introduction of a bill, and that before its
passage it must be read three times, and that without the special order of the assembly it
cannot be read twice the same day.  These examples are sufficient to show the absurdity of
the idea that the rules of Congress in all things determine the common parliamentary law.]

=== Page 12 ============================================================

Plan of the Work.

This Manual is prepared to partially meet this want in deliberative assemblies that are not
legislative in their character.  It has been made sufficiently complete to answer for the rules
of an assembly, until they see fit to adopt special rules conflicting with and superseding
any of its rules of detail, such as the Order of Business [§ 44], etc.  Even in matters of
detail the practice of Congress is followed, wherever it is not manifestly unsuited to ordinary
assemblies, and in such cases, in Part I, there will be found, in a foot note, the Congressional
practice. In the important matters referred to above, in which the practice of the House of

=== Page 13 ============================================================

Representatives settles the common parliamentary law of the country, this Manual strictly conforms
to such practice.* [On account of the party lines being so strictly drawn in Congress, no such
thing as harmony of action is possible, and it has been found best to give a bare majority
in the House of Representatives (but not in the Senate) the power to take final action upon
a question without allowing of any discussion.  In ordinary societies more regard should be
paid to the rights of the minority, and a two-thirds vote be required, as in this Manual [§
39], for sustaining an objection to the introduction of a question, or for adopting a motion
for the Previous Question, or for adopting an order closing or limiting debate.  In this respect
the policy of the Pocket Manual is a mean between those of the House and Senate.  But some
societies will doubtless find it advantageous to follow the practice of the H. R., and others
will prefer that of the Senate.  It requires a majority, according to the Pocket Manual, to
order the yeas and nays, which is doubtless best in the majority of assemblies; but in all
bodies in which the members are responsible to their constituents, a much smaller number should
have this power.  In Congress it requires but a one-fifth vote, and in some bodies a single
member can require a vote to be taken by yeas and nays.  Any society adopting this Manual,
should make its rules govern them in all cases to which they are applicable, and in which they
are not inconsistent with the By-Laws and Rules of Order of the society.  Their own rules should
include all of the cases where it is desirable to vary from the rules in the Manual, and especially
should provide for a Quorum [§ 43], and an Order of Business [§ 44], as suggested in these rules.]

The Manual is divided into two distinct parts, each complete in itself. [The table at the end
contains a large amount of information in a tabular form, for easy reference in the midst of
the business of a meeting.]

Part I contains a set of Rules of Order systematically arranged, as shown in the Table of Contents.
Each one of the forty-five sections is complete in itself, so that no one unfamiliar with the
work can be misled in examining any particular subject.  Cross references are freely used to
save repeating

=== Page 14 ============================================================

from other sections, and by this means the reader, without using the index, is referred to
everything in the Rules of Order that has any bearing upon the subject he is investigating.
The references are by sections, and for convenience the numbers of the sections are placed
at the top of each page.  The motions are arranged under the usual classes, in their order
of rank, but in the index under the word motion will be found an alphabetical list of all the
motions generally used.  In reference to each motion there is stated:

  (1) Of what motions it takes precedence (that is, what motions may,
      be pending, and yet it be in order to make this motion).
  (2) To what motions it yields (that is, what motions may be made
      while this motion is pending).
  (3) Whether it is debatable or not.
  (4) Whether it can be amended or not.
  (5) In case the motion can have no subsidiary motion applied to it,
      the fact is stated [see Adjourn, § 11, for an example:  the
      meaning is, that the particular motion to adjourn, for example,
      cannot be laid on the table, postponed, committed or amended].
  (6) The effect of the motion if adopted.
  (7) The form of stating the question when peculiar, and whatever other
      information is necessary to enable one to understand the question.

Part II.  While the second part covers the entire ground of the first part, it does so in a
much simpler manner, being intended for those who have

=== Page 15 ============================================================

no acquaintance with the usages of deliberative assemblies.  It also explains the method of
organizing an assembly or society, and conducting a meeting.  The motions are treated on an
entirely different plan, being classified according to the objects for which they are used,
and those of each class compared together so that the reader may obtain the best motion for
the accomplishment of any given object.  It omits the complications of parliamentary law, and
has but few references to the rules of Congress, or those in this Manual.  In order to make
it complete in itself, it was necessary to repeat a few pages from the first part.

Definitions.

In addition to the terms defined above (taking precedence of, yielding to and applying to,
see p. 14), there are other terms that are liable to be misunderstood, to which attention should
he called.

Meeting and Session.--In this Manual the term "meeting" is used to denote an assembling together
of the members of a deliberative assembly for any length of time, during which there is no
separation of the members by adjournment.  An adjournment to meet again at some other time,
even the same day, terminates the meeting, but not the session, which latter includes all the
adjourned meetings.  The next meeting, in this case, would be an "adjourned meeting" of the
same session.

A "meeting" of an assembly is terminated by a

=== Page 16 ============================================================

temporary adjournment; a "session" of an assembly ends with an adjournment without day, and
may consist of many meetings [see Session, § 42].

Previous Question--This term is frequently understood to refer to the question previously under
consideration.  As used in this country it is equivalent to a motion to "Stop debate, and proceed
to voting on all the questions before the assembly," with certain exceptions, where it affects
only one motion (as to postpone, to reconsider and an appeal; see § 20 for a full explanation).

Shall the Question be Considered (or discussed)?  This question, which is put as soon as a
subject is brought before an assembly, if any member "objects to its consideration" (or "discussion,"
or "introduction"), is not intended to merely cut off debate, but to prevent the question from
coming before the assembly for its action.  If decided by a two-thirds vote in the negative,
the question is removed from before the assembly immediately [see § 15].

Whenever the word "assembly," which is used throughout these rules, occurs in forms of motions
(as in Appeals, § 14), it is better to replace it by the special term used to designate the
particular assembly; as for instance, "Society," or "Convention," or "Board."  The term "Congress,"
when used in this Manual, refers to the House of Representatives of the U.S.

Art. I. Introduction of Business. [§§ 1-5.]

1. All business should be brought before the assembly by a motion of a member, or by the presentation
of a communication to the assembly.  It is not usual, however, to make a motion to receive
the reports of committees [§ 30] or communications to the assembly; and in many other cases
in the ordinary routine of business, the formality of a motion is dispensed with; but should
any member object, a regular motion becomes necessary.

2. Before a member can make a motion or address the assembly upon any question, it is necessary
that he obtain the floor; that is, he must rise and address the presiding officer

=== Page 18 ============================================================

by his title, thus:  "Mr. Chairman" [§ 34], who will then announce the member's name.  Where
two or more rise at the same time the Chairman must decide who is entitled to the floor, which
he does by announcing that member's name. "Your freedom will remain, but pity" he repeated.

"Sure of your army," continued the Chancellor - "I take Milan," added Pescara. "My Plan is designed.
"

"You need not take it, since the Duke is a member of the League, whose commander you are."

"Right, I had forgotten.

In any case, Milan is the central point. And then?"

"Commanded the troops of your holiness, Venice and Naples, not to call the kids."

"Stop, moron! Naples is Spanish."

"To Naples For ye have your nephew then sent as your vice-king who by his cruelty have submitted
a few weeks. "

"When my viceroy? I King of Naples? Since when I wear the crown?" asked Pescara left.

"Behold, the winged feet, they place you are before your threshold," said the chancellor blushing.

The
cold air of the general's warmed up, like a ray does not affect a Crown, but from the circles
of light of his approaching woman. "To dream, Morone," he said.

"Once at the top of the combined arms and Italian positions in unnehmbaren" The Chancellor
rode away with astonishing security, "nothing to prevent you with
your Kaiser auseinandersetzet, perhaps even without a battle, because
I know you, though, no, because the first commander of the time, the
subtle game of chess and the extensive calculations the strategy to
those sudden and at least blind decisions vorziehet the battlefield.

I say, maybe even without bloodshed, for the Emperor is not as easy a new Mr Field find and bring
together a second army in Italy after you and yours has lost at least give him if France and England
to do, according to the of them with our league adopted the Agreement. "

"I know your alliance with King Francis, even its text," threw Pescara, "but do not care about.
The king tormented in his Spanish prison.

By one hour jump earlier on a saddled horse, he reveals hundreds of your league, as I had to
think about. "

"Just a few days," the chancellor insisted with a funny face, "it
has the Regent Louise of Paris written, it maintained the alliance
as their virtues - "

A whistle cut through the room ... The Chancellor listened in amazement. It was about a bird in the
Windows are vorbeigeschwirrt.

"There are others as occupying the Emperor," he continued, "the crescent
and the German princes.

"

"The half-moon, yes", said the general. "By using the German princes, however, and even its
new doctrine could possibly tolerate the emperor. Do not you moron? "

This thinking said: "It seems so, but not yet, if I am right, if any. not with the new doctrine.
The Emperor needs of the church for his heavy and dark mood, he has inherited from the mother.
The new faith requires stronger souls. "

"Do you understand about these things, Chancellor?" asked the captain curiously.

"How could I, Pescara I? I like you and we are all inhabitants of
the reality that a child of Light, with the ancient wisdom over the
end rather than as larvae and notes and billowing fog, the huge mirrors
that of our own again and earthly Existence.

But among those who believe with the people good and evil, and body and soul the fable of a
final court, is now, as you know, argue about irreconcilable the best armor on that day the trumpet-blowing.
Our wise church will open their booths and present understanding of good works from their stock
for sale.

The German monk but scolds and shouts: This is rubbish! Not throw your money away! You have it
for free. Your Debts are paid. Believe it only, and they are no more! Such believe, however,
needs it is a great courage, for it is the most incredible thing under the unbelievable. But bring
It finished the German heads so they do not need any more awareness and Pfaff are in their defiant
security Italians think about violence that we have rejected or superstitious.

I speak in the rough, Pescara. But these ideas are invalid per se, in life the most real powers
that be neglected no statesman. And you with your great job least, Pescara, if you are also even
a wicked man, I know you. "His smile remained unanswered.

"Here you're wrong, Chancellor," said earnestly Pescara. "I believe in a deity, and indeed not imaginary.
But in the other, you're right. I've seen it with my eyes. On Evenings of my battle "- he meant
the Pavia -" I saw in the hospital two highly sacrilegious People are dying, a German and a Spaniard,
in this among his relics and the Arms of two priests, trembling and quivering, those alone, but
full of confidence and joy. I spoke to him, because I know a few German words, and learned that
he dare and defy to the repentant thief. But let us leave these colors of the soul. Back to your cause,
for I believe that you still are not finished. "" Certainly not, and Pescara. Only then, when you
have set by the sword or by cunning agreement the emperor out of play will only then do you
build your greatness and freedom of Italy. The twelve labors of Hercules! But you all sides of your
nature and properties call to arms: patience and determination, Passion and calculation, guile
and great attitude. No particle of you is pointless . Go You know you do not yet Pescara! Only
then you will show up as the man who you are, all in your stature:
for the people, a terrible and beneficent demon, for the Host an infallible
winner, for the patriots of the finisher Italy, for the scholars of
the revived Roman ambition for the prince, as much as you will let
her exist, the ruling Ally.

You exploit all the possibilities and benefits of the century. You will the defender of the Pope
and conquer him back his cities and provinces that you consider keeps up, you ride as an arbitrator
between the Republic and the Medici verröchelnden in Florence, and they obey you both. Yes, even
forcing the proud princess of Hadria you in your power circuit! I see you, "beamed Morone,"
how are you going up to the Doge and their Seas wed.

So you waxen until you and your lovely wife on the Roman Capitol one thousand jubilant Raise arms
in the air and deifying up throughout Italy show as his king, which you then, as you now, I fear,
is not yet possible, as your property and your fame some will love, so that ending, which I started,
because only my love for Italy, the best, the only good thing about
me throwing myself at your feet, you Heartless, "and he embraced the
knees of the commander with such a fervent gesture that this jumping
deprived of such adoration, but still seemed taken internally, except
that it this Truth of feeling in a lying spirit captivated, be it
that his powerful mind the suggested concepts of its potential size
and Italy involuntarily to a viable Whole, together shut.

He was the Registrar and walked slowly with crossed arms over his
chest several times by the room, as modified by chance, stopping in
front of him.

"How many of my years asking you want from me, moron? "he threw out.

"Many, no doubt," replied the Chancellor. "The more the better! Only those with long and fertile periods,
which can grow things quietly and relentlessly indestructible, transparent barriers to gnaw,
calm and dull the conscience, and even the original Wicked atone and holy, is just such a broad
and necessary steps lasting in the state reached. Your best ally, Pescara, is life. Ten, twenty,
why not thirty years, Pescara? Yes you stand in the fullness of power and the only way to scoop
obvious from the overflowing source. You attacked your treasure barely, and not at least so
you have the immortal gods to Italy this your beautiful Works of reference, because you, Roman said,
a youth-crazy and far from being a shadow of death must not touch!

"

A sudden prominent hard and dark train had transformed the face of the commander. He met the chancellor
with such a hostile views that this drew back a step. "You know," he threatened, "that if I
should overwhelm my ambition, the first victim of your Master, the Sforza was? For I began by
giving your Milan the Bourbon, the my alter ego, my right hand and
a Gonzaga is.

I would treat him! About Delivery Only you give me the Sforza family? "

"By all the gods, no!" cried the horrified Chancellor.

"I tell my duke, never! Never! And, "he exclaimed indignantly," how can you think of Pescara,
our pure and holy to stain thing with the Bourbon! "

"Look at these people!" taunted him Pescara. "Is there something cheeky? The most miserable
Prince, he will keep faith, and seems to me to break it to my sublime Emperor! Behold these
disjointed mind! He lured me to the betrayal and wants to stay clear of treason! "

"This is something completely different," lamented the Registrar. "The constable has his country
betrayed, and you save by adding waste from a prince who does not
yours is.

Duke disclose my, my gracious Lord! The Moor will appear to me in dreams !"... he made a pathetic
sigh ... "But, nevertheless, be it! But now, Pescara resist, also you no more! Do you have Mercy
on Italy? Answer me, cruel, "and the tears broke him out of sight.

"Not today, moron!" comforted him Pescara. "We are both tired and need rest. It is the hour of
siesta. "He rang the bell." Ippolito, "he instructed the boy," the lead Lord, who is a great
statesman, in the tower wing. The steward is to him the whole Room number of the top deck open
and use it carefully and make plenty of entertaining.

You find a selected library, Registrar, and draw your wollet air,
is rising in the Garden down, he is shady and extends to the walls.

I invite you not to board because I expect Donna Victoria, is one of my evening. Let the time
you will not last long. Tomorrow we will meet again. "

"How will I pass the day?" cried the Chancellor.

"Everything passes more thing. You approach, I ask the guards do not verstündet, your for the
German. "He looked pale the Registrar." Fear nothing, "he concluded friendly and dismissed
him.

As he turned round again, approached him, the Duke and Del Guasto that their hiding place had
left, both in the highest excitement of Bourbon with pale feverishly
flushed Cheeks, eyes blazing with Del Guasto.

Pescara guessed that the overheard conversation and the shown fame she had deceived them both
and charmed.

Del Guasto thirsting after prey and the Duke cleaned after the laurel.

Yet they were silent, but its urgent and pleading Gesture would turn
into words.

Since they closed the mouth of Pescara.

"Gentlemen," he said, "this theater was played. The play was a long time. Have you do not yawn
in your box? "

As suggested in the bourbon mood suddenly umspringender a shrill laugh. "Tragedy or farce? "he asked.

"Tragedy,
Your Highness."

"And entitled to?"

"Death and the fool," replied Pescara.

Chapter Four

Through its long suite of rooms, the chancellor of Milan walked restlessly up and down. The
Shutters were closed against the burning afternoon sun, and only through a column shot every now
and then a mischievous beam in the dusk, a bright strip of the Tile pulling, while the depth of the
chambers in the mystery remained.

But not the narrowest Flash of light illuminated the Registrar for the soul of Pescara. He had
given up his whole person, Pescara not a particle of itself, and not just a guilty, self-confessed
was now the Chancellor, but also a prisoner or not much different. But far from that his exposure
of him or his half-regretted prison had frightened him: on the contrary, He reveled in the
bounty of his total devotion. Not even his shamefully betrayed Duke now troubled his conscience,
so completely filled him the passion to Pescara to seize, and the appeal of his attack on
this one man, whose great attitude and serious game in the just completed scene, he sincerely
admired. He set the scene continued, every word of dialogue was repeated in his ear, and even
every look and Formed from the same gesture in his face and swung away in his muscles - but the meaning
or scope of what is said, he became embroiled in insoluble, in mortal doubt. An interpretation
to the other he threw to last to arrive at the probable conclusion Pescara is still uncertain, yet
he was in conflict with itself.

Because he thought longingly of the confederate who could every hour, every minute to bring
him Victoria Colonna and the value it seemed immense. Only such could such a . Defeat Not a rousing,
domineering wife, as it was then that many in Italy his being driven, but the noblest women
of the time led his thing, and in each of these Virtue and beauty of Italy and of embodying his trespasses
and sins, free form seemed to him his country so unique and the fame, it is self-reproducing,
so unique, that even here, and just a Pescara Pescara was unable to resist. An alliance means
acting with indecent brightened in this heavenly eyes a purity that justified the name of a "Holy
League" in a free and secular sense. The admiration of the divine woman, which, he believed,
was destined to save Italy, the chancellor was blessed to worship and devotion, for he was the
most exalted and the meanest Feelings in the same manner and strength capable.

Now that the confidence gained lit up his affairs, it required him to the light of day, he came across
a shop and stood, looking around, in the so-called snake Saale, of which he often tells his
Duke, which he himself had seen but never before.

Above the wainscoting ran along the four walls of a painted braid of snakes, the two BWA are entwining,
one of the fire-breathing dragon of the Sforza, the other the terrible emblem of the Visconti, the
snake with the child in the throat. Legend or truth, the sweet Leonardo da Vinci was had during
his long service in the Moor: as the creator of the shy blessed ring He once in the ducal house
of Novara and stayed in a few hours of this game a cruel mood started and ended under the pretext
of a glorification of his Princely House. Not impossible, for the sculptor of the tenderest love
smile at the same time the grimace and the horror. First, with amused, sometimes frightened eyes
looked with the Chancellor of the wild ring, the work of an intrepid
imagination, which is practiced it had the monsters and the naked
child in the devouring jaws of a sequence of natural to give motion.
Then suddenly it seemed to him that I live and spinning the thread.
The chancellor used a shudder and went back to the window.

He saw
the lonely castle garden in under a broad, deep dark vault of trees
Shadow lost. In the dazzling sea of ​​light, and sometimes a fragment
of the jagged Walls. Only at some distance from the most luxuriant
green rose to a three terraces small villa in the corner and visible
from two sides, each of which an image offered to those with a Tower
endings, this weinumwundenen running into a portico. It would seem
Morone, the charming country house, parts of which grew out slightly
apart, must determine for Victoria and his idea of ​​Pescara, which
you are not in a heavy and from the steps of the guards booming castle,
but ready in a pleasant and peaceful place of loving reception.  The vote on an Appeal may also be reconsidered
[§ 27].  An Appeal is not in order when another Appeal is pending.

It is the duty of the presiding officer to enforce the rules and orders of the assembly, without
debate or delay.  It is also the right of every member, who notices a breach of a rule to insist
upon its enforcement. In such cases he shall rise from his seat, and say, "Mr. Chairman, I
rise to a point of order."  The speaker should immediately take his seat, and the Chairman
requests the member to state his point of order, which he does, and resumes his seat.  The
Chair decides the point, and then, if no appeal is taken, permits the first member to resume
his speech.  If the member's remarks are decided to be improper, and any one objects to his
continuing his speech, he cannot continue it without a vote of the assembly to that effect.
Instead of the method just described, it is usual, when it is simply a case of improper language
used in debate, for a member to say, "I call the gentleman to order;" the Chairman

=== Page 32 ============================================================

decides whether the speaker is in or out of order, and proceeds as before.  The Chairman can
ask the advice of members when he has to decide questions of order, but the advice must be
given sitting, to avoid the appearance of debate; or the Chair, when unable to decide the question,
may at once submit it to the assembly.  The effect of laying an appeal on the table, is to
sustain, at least for the time, the decision of the Chair, and does not carry to the table
the question which gave rise to the question of order.

15. Objection to the Consideration of a Question.  An objection can be made to any principal
motion [§ 6], but only when it is first introduced, before it has been debated.  It is similar
to a question of order [§ 14,] in that it can be made while another member has the floor, and
does not require a second; and as the Chairman can call a member to order, so can he put this
question if he deems it necessary, upon his own responsibility.  It can not be debated [§ 35]
or have any subsidiary motion [§ 7] applied to it.  When a motion is made and any member "objects
to its consideration," the Chairman shall immediately put the question, "Will the assembly
consider it?" or, "Shall the question be considered"

=== Page 33 ============================================================

[or discussed]?  If decided in the negative by a two-thirds vote [§ 39], the whole matter is
dismissed for that session [§ 42]; otherwise the discussion continues as if this question had
never been made.

The Object of this motion is not to cut off debate (for which other motions are provided, see
§ 37), but to enable the assembly to avoid altogether any question which it may deem irrelevant,
unprofitable or contentious.* [In Congress, the introduction of such questions could be temporarily
prevented by a majority vote under the 41st Rule of the House of Representatives, which is
as follows:  "Where any motion or proposition is made, the question, 'Will the House now consider
it?' shall not be put unless it is demanded by some member, or is deemed necessary by the Speaker."
The English use the "Previous Question," for a similar purpose [see note to § 20].  The question
of consideration is seldom raised in Congress, but in assemblies with very short sessions,
where but few questions can or should be considered, it seems a necessity that two-thirds of
the assembly should be able to instantly throw out a question they do not wish to consider.
The more common form, in ordinary societies, of putting this question, is, "Shall the question
be discussed?"  The form to which preference is given in the rule conforms more to the Congressional
one, and is less liable to be misunderstood.]

Reading Papers.  [For the order of precedence, see § 8.] Where papers are laid before the assembly,
every member has a right to have them once read before he can be compelled to vote on them,
and whenever a member asks for the reading of any such

=== Page 34 ============================================================

paper, evidently for information, and not for delay, the Chair should direct it to be read,
if no one objects.  But a member has not the right to have anything read (excepting stated
above) without getting permission from the assembly.

17. Withdrawal of a Motion.  [For order of precedence, see § 8.] When a question is before
the assembly and the mover wishes to withdraw or modify it, or substitute a different one in
its place, if no one objects, the presiding officer grants the permission; if any objection
is made, it will be necessary to obtain leave to withdraw, etc., on a motion for that purpose.
This motion cannot be debated or amended. When a motion is withdrawn, the effect is the same
as if it had never been made.* [In Congress, a motion may be withdrawn by the mover, before
a decision or amendment [Rule 40, H. R.].  Nothing would be gained in ordinary societies by
varying from the common law as stated above.]

18. Suspension of the Rules.  [For the order of precedence, see § 8.] This motion is not debatable,
and cannot be amended, nor can any subsidiary [§ 7] motion be applied to it, nor a vote on
it be reconsidered [§ 27],

=== Page 35 ============================================================

nor a motion to suspend the rules for the same purpose be renewed [§ 26] at the same meeting,
though it may be renewed after an adjournment, though the next meeting be held the same day.*
[In Congress, it cannot be renewed the same day.] The rules of the assembly shall not be suspended
except for a definite purpose, and by a two-thirds vote.

The Form of this motion is, to "suspend the rules which interfere with," etc., specifying the
object of the suspension.

Subsidiary Motions. [§§ 19-24; see § 7.]

19. To Lie on the Table.  This motion takes precedence of all other Subsidiary Questions [§
7], and yields to any Privileged [§ 9] or Incidental [§ 8] Question. It is not debatable, and
cannot be amended or have any other subsidiary motion [§ 7] applied to it.  It removes the
subject from consideration till the assembly vote to take it from the table.

The Form of this motion is, "I move that the question lie on the table," or, "that it be laid
on the table," or, "to lay the question

=== Page 36 ============================================================

on the table."  When it is desired to take the question up again, a motion is made, either
"to take the question from the table," or "to now consider such and such a question;" which
motion is undebatable, and cannot have any subsidiary motion applied to it.

The Object of this motion is to postpone the subject in such a way, that at any time it can
be taken up, either at the same or some future meeting, which could not be accomplished by
a motion to postpone, either definitely or indefinitely.  It is also frequently used to suppress
a question [§ 59], which it does, provided a majority vote can never be obtained to take it
from the table during that session [§ 42].

The Effect of this motion is in general to place on the table everything that adheres to the
subject; so that if an amendment be ordered to lie on the table, the subject which it is proposed
to amend, goes there with it.  The following cases are exceptional:  (a) An appeal [§ 14] being
laid on the table, has the effect of sustaining, at least for the time, the decision of the
Chair, and does not carry the original subject to the table.  (b) So when a motion to reconsider
[§ 27] a question is

=== Page 37 ============================================================

laid on the table, the original question is left where it was before the reconsideration was
moved.  (c) An amendment to the minutes being laid on the table does not carry the minutes with it.

Even after the ordering of the Previous Question up to the moment of taking the last vote under
it, it is in order to lay upon the table the questions still before the assembly.

20. The Previous Question* [The Previous Question is a technical name for this motion, conveying
a wrong impression of its import, as it has nothing to do with the subject previously under
consideration.  To demand the previous question is equivalent in effect to moving "That debate
now cease, and the assembly immediately proceed to vote on the questions before it," (the exceptions
are stated above).  The English Previous Question is an entirely different one from ours, and
is used for a different purpose.  In the English Parliament it is moved by the enemies of a
measure, who then vote in the negative, and thus prevent for the day, the consideration of
the main question, (which in this country could be accomplished by "objecting to the consideration
of the question" [§ 15], if the objection were sustained).  In our Congress, it is moved by
the friends of a measure, who vote in the affirmative with a view to cutting off debate and
immediately bringing the assembly to a vote on the questions before it.  The rules in the two
cases are as different as the objects of the motions.  It requires only a majority vote for
its adoption in the House of Representatives, and is not allowed in the United States Senate.]
takes precedence of every debatable question [§ 35], and yields to Privileged [§ 9] and Incidental
[§ 8] questions, and to the motion to Lie on the table [§ 19].  It is not debatable, and cannot
be amended or have any other Subsidiary

=== Page 38 ============================================================

[§ 7] motion applied to it.  It shall require a two-thirds vote for its adoption.

When a member calls for the previous question, and the call is seconded, the presiding officer
must immediately put the question:  "Shall the main question be now put?"  If adopted, the
member who introduced the pending measure still has the right to close the debate [§ 34]; after
which the presiding officer, without allowing further discussion, shall put to vote the questions
before the assembly, in their order of precedence, till the main question, with all its subsidiary
and incidental questions, is disposed of (see the exceptions below).  If it fails, the discussion
continues as if this motion had not been made.

The previous question can be moved on a pending amendment, and if adopted, debate is closed
on the amendment only.  After the amendment is voted on, the main question is again open to
debate and amendments.  [In this case the form of the question would be similar to this : 
"Shall the amendment be now put to the question?"]

=== Page 39 ============================================================

The Object of this motion is to bring the assembly to a vote on the question before it without
further debate.  In ordinary assemblies it is rarely expedient to deprive a large minority
of the right of debate, and yet two-thirds of the members should have the right to close the
debate when they think it best.

It applies to questions of privilege [§ 12] as well as any other debatable questions.  It is
allowable for a member to submit a resolution and at the same time move the previous question
thereon.

To illustrate the Effect of this motion, suppose it is adopted when we have before the assembly,
(a) the main question; (b) an amendment; (c) a motion to commit; (d) a motion to amend the
last motion by giving the committee instructions.  The previous question being carried, the
presiding officer would immediately put the question on the last motion (d); then on the motion
to commit, (c); and if this is adopted, of course the subject is referred to the committee
and disposed of for the present; but if it fails, the amendment (b) is put, and finally the
main question.

Exceptions:  If the Previous Question is

=== Page 40 ============================================================

carried while a motion to Postpone is pending, its effect is only to bring the assembly to
a vote on that motion; if it is voted not to postpone, the subject is again open for debate.
So if an Appeal [§ 14] or a motion to Reconsider [§ 27] is pending when the Previous Question
is ordered, it applies only to them and is exhausted by the vote on them.

An affirmative vote on the motion to Commit [§ 22] exhausts the Previous Question, and if the
vote is reconsidered, it is divested of the Previous Question.

[For other methods of closing debate see § 37 and § 58].

21. To Postpone to a Certain Day.  This motion takes precedence of a motion to Commit, or Amend,
or Indefinitely Postpone, and yields to any Privileged [§ 9] or Incidental [§ 8] question,
and to the motion to Lie on the Table, or for the Previous Question.  It can be amended by
altering the time, and the Previous Question can be applied to it without affecting any other
motions pending.  It allows of very limited debate [§ 35], and that must not go into the merits
of the subject matter any further than is necessary to enable the

=== Page 41 ============================================================

assembly to judge the propriety of the postponement.

The Effect of this motion is to postpone the entire subject to the time specified, until which
time it cannot be taken up except by a two-thirds vote [§ 13].  When that time arrives it is
entitled to be taken up in preference to every thing except Privileged questions.  Where several
questions are postponed to different times and are not reached then, they shall be considered
in the order of the times to which they were postponed.  It is not in order to postpone to
a time beyond that session [§ 42] of the assembly, except* [In Congress a motion cannot be
postponed to the next session, but it is customary in ordinary societies.] to the day of the
next session when it comes up with the unfinished business, and consequently takes precedence
of new business [§ 44].  If it is desired to hold an adjourned meeting to consider a special
subject, the time to which the assembly shall adjourn [§ 10] should be first fixed before making
the motion to postpone the subject to that day.

22. To Commit [or Recommit as it is called when the subject has been previously committed].
This motion takes precedence of the motions to Amend or Indefinitely Postpone, and yields to
any Privileged [§ 9] or Incidental

=== Page 42 ============================================================

[§ 8] Question, and also to the motion to Lie on the Table, or for the Previous Question, or
to Postpone to a certain day.  It can be amended by altering the committee, or giving it instructions.
It is debatable, and opens to debate [§ 35] the merits of the question it is proposed to commit.

The Form of this motion is "to refer the subject to a committee."  When different committees
are proposed they should he voted in the following order:  (1) Committee the whole [§ 32],
(2) a standing committee, and (3) a special (or select) committee.  The number of a committee
is usually decided without the formality of a motion, as in filling blanks [§ 25]:  the Chairman
asks "of how many shall the committee consist?" and a question is then put upon each number
suggested, beginning with the largest.  The number and kind of the committee need not be decided
till after it has been voted to refer the subject to a committee.  If the committee is a select
one, and the motion does not include the method of appointing it, and there is no standing
rule on the subject, the Chairman inquires how the committee shall be appointed, and this is
usually decided informally.  Sometimes the Chair "appoints," in which case he names the members
of the committee and no vote is taken

=== Page 43 ============================================================

upon them; or the committee is "nominated" either by the Chair or members of the assembly (no
member nominating more than one except by general consent), and then they are all voted upon
together, except where more nominations are made than the number of the committee, when they
shall be voted upon singly.

Where a committee is one for action (a committee of arrangements for holding a public meeting,
for example), it should generally be small, and no one placed upon it who is not favorable
to the proposed action; and if any such should be appointed he should ask to be excused.  But
when the committee is for deliberation or investigation, it is of the utmost importance that
all parties be represented on it, so that in committee the fullest discussion may take place,
and thus diminish the chances of unpleasant debates in the assembly.

In ordinary assemblies, by judicious appointment of committees, debates upon delicate and troublesome
questions can be mostly confined to the committees, which will contain the representative members
of all parties.  [See Reports of Committees, § 29.]

23. To Amend.  This motion takes precedence of nothing but the question which it proposed to
amend, and yields to any Privileged

=== Page 44 ============================================================

[§ 9], Incidental [§ 8] or Subsidiary [§ 7] Question, except to Indefinitely Postpone.  It
can be amended itself, but this "amendment of an amendment" cannot be amended.  An Amendment
may be inconsistent with one already adopted, or may directly conflict with the spirit of the
original motion, but it must have a direct bearing upon the subject of that motion.  To illustrate:
a motion for a vote of thanks could be amended by substituting for "thanks" the word "censure;"
or one condemning certain customs could be amended by adding other customs.

An Amendment may be in any of the following forms:  (a) to "add or insert" certain words or
paragraphs; (b) to "strike out" certain words or paragraphs, the question, however, being stated
by the Chair thus: "Shall these words (or paragraphs) stand as a part of the resolution?" and
if this is adopted (that is, the motion to "strike out," fails) it does not preclude either
amendment or a motion to "strike out and insert;" (c) "to strike certain words and insert others,"
which motion is indivisible, and if lost does not preclude

=== Page 45 ============================================================

another motion to strike out the same words and insert different ones; (d) to "substitute"
another motion on the same subject for the one pending; (e) to "divide the question" into two
or more questions, as the mover specifies, so as to get a separate vote on any particular point
or points [see § 4].

If a paragraph is inserted it should be perfected by its friends previous to voting on it,
as when once inserted it cannot be struck out or amended except by adding to it.  The same
is true in regard to words to be inserted in a resolution, as when once inserted they cannot
be struck out, except by a motion to strike out the paragraph, or such a portion of it as shall
make the question an entirely different one from that of inserting the particular words.  The
principle involved is that when the assembly has voted that certain words shall form a part
of a resolution, it is not in order to make another motion which involves exactly the same
question as the one they have decided.  The only way to bring it up again is to move a Reconsideration
[§ 27] of the vote by which the words were inserted.

In stating the question on an Amendment the Chairman should read (1) the passage to be amended;
(2) the words to be struck out, if any; (3) the words to be inserted, if any; and (4) the whole
passage as it will stand if

=== Page 46 ============================================================

the amendment is adopted.  [For amending reports of committees, and propositions containing
several paragraphs, see § 44.]

The numbers prefixed to paragraphs are only marginal indications, and should be corrected,
if necessary, by the clerk, without any motion to amend.

The following motions cannot be amended:

  To Adjourn (when unqualified) ............................ See § 11.
  For the Orders of the Day ................................  '' § 12.
  All Incidental Questions .................................  '' §  8.
  To Lie on the Table ......................................  '' § 19.
  For the Previous Question ................................  '' § 20.
  An Amendment of an Amendment .............................  '' § 23.
  To Postpone Indefinitely .................................  '' § 24.
  Reconsider ...............................................  '' § 27.

An Amendment to Rules of Order, By-Laws or a Constitution shall require previous notice and
a two-thirds vote for its adoption [see § 45].

24. To Postpone Indefinitely.  This motion takes precedence of nothing except the Principal
Question [§ 6], and yields to any Privileged [§ 9], Incidental [§ 8] or Subsidiary [§ 7] Motion,
except to Amend.  It cannot be amended; it opens to debate the entire question which it is
proposed to postpone.  Its effect is to entirely remove the question from before the assembly
for that session [§ 42].

=== Page 47 ============================================================

The Previous Question [§ 20], if ordered when this motion is pending, applies only to it without
affecting the main question.

Miscellaneous Motions. [§§ 25-27.]

25. Filling Blanks.  In filling blanks the largest sum and the longest time proposed shall
be first put to the question.  Sometimes the most convenient way of amending a resolution is
to create a blank by moving to strike out a certain number or time.  It is customary for any
number of members to propose numbers to fill a blank without the formality of a motion, these
different propositions not being regarded in the light of amendments.

Nominations are treated in a similar manner, so that the second nomination, instead of being
an amendment to the first, is an independent motion, which, if the first fails, is to be immediately
voted upon.  Any number of nominations can be made, the Chairman announcing each name as he
hears it, and they

=== Page 48 ============================================================

should be voted upon in the order announced, until one receives a vote sufficient for an election.

26. Renewal of a Motion.  When any Principal Question [§ 6] or Amendment has been once acted
upon by the assembly, it cannot be taken up again at the same session [§ 42] except by a motion
to Reconsider [§ 27].  The motion to Adjourn can be renewed if there has been progress in debate,
or any business transacted.  As a general rule the introduction of any motion that alters the
state of affairs makes it admissible to renew any Privileged or Incidental motion (excepting
Suspension of the Rules as provided in § 18), or Subsidiary motion (excepting an amendment),
as in such a case the real question before the assembly is a different one.

To illustrate:  a motion that a question lie on the table having failed, suppose afterwards
it be moved to refer the matter to a committee, it is now in order to move again that the subject
lie on the table; but such a motion would not be in order, if it were not made till after the
failure of the motion to commit, as

=== Page 49 ============================================================

the question then resumes its previous condition.

When a subject has been referred to a committee which reports at the same meeting, the matter
stands before the assembly as if it had been introduced for the first time.  A motion which
has been withdrawn has not been acted upon, and therefore can be renewed.

27. Reconsider.  It is in order at any time, even when another member has the floor, or while
the assembly is voting on the motion to Adjourn, during the day* [In Congress any one can move
a reconsideration, excepting where the vote is taken by yeas and nays [§ 38], when the rule
above applies.  The motion can be made on the same or succeeding day.] on which a motion has
been acted upon, to move to "Reconsider the vote" and have such motion "entered on the record,"
but it cannot be considered while another question is before the assembly. See, "he whispered. Tentative
steps to Victoria Colonna came into the large green room, the husband of his favorite place searching.
Still wearing her dress the dust of the road, they might be hardly slipped from his horse. Then
she saw him sleep, she stopped and got in his sight. Then melted she suddenly in tears, from
an excess of joy, or it frightened her St. Seriousness of the beloved, now dug deep wounds
and pains of trains. A few moments but, and she came up to him. With infinite love, she put her
hand under the strict head, and gently lifting it, it woke her with fervent kisses. Pescara
opened his eyes. Gently He pressed his wife to the right breast and gave her a kiss on the
forehead.

As the commander, rose Morone had slipped away in a rare emotion of chastity, Pescara and only
saw the doctor himself. The left looping around Victoria, he took the Numa's right hand and
said to his wife: "This is my doctor," and these, in their fiery nature bent the knee and covered
his limp hand with kisses. "She has the wound of my Heroes closed, "she rejoiced with gratitude.
Then she straightened up and asked in deep agitation, "Numa Dati
knife?"

The old man bowed.

And Victoria, carried away by her warm heart, turned to the husband, mouth to mouth, and complained,
"Before we look forward, you must give me this right and create our
nephew has it! the granddaughter tempted and refuses, the evil man,
to atone for his guilt by marriage!

"

"Is it so, Numa? said the captain, and said yes because the old man sadly, "Why did you the secret?
"

"At first, glory, it was a mere conjecture, as they secretly left my house and Novara. And as I was
you, who with his own great destiny, with the small of a girl ?

Deal Only today I received assurance by a letter from Rome, by the abbess, refuge in their convent
to the poor child had. "

Now Victoria urged pleadingly to the left side of their hero, who under the pressure of Body
of woman seemed to feel a physical pain.

To hide it and get over the that he forward a few steps.

The dreie stood in front of the playing lights of the fountain. "Most beautiful woman, I was warmly
requested to see you again, "said the general," and there you are, my soul! "He looked her
shining in his eyes. "But your noble eyelids are still quite dusted from the trip. Your cloth,
"and she gave it to him, it networked, and closed his eyes, while her forehead and Eyelid and
cheek washed and bathed.

"I remember quite well your granddaughter, Numa, although I have hardly
seen.

Deep Blue Eyes and auburn hair, as this because, you know, and Julie
is her name?

What do their thing concerns, which I think difficult and tragic. Not that I would line up, the bad,
you know, Victoria - also one I can not call it anything else - to force into marriage with her,
he would , Add, no doubt, for he is my creation and I have power over him. But I wonder me if
it was good to tie the scorned a heartless and cruel, of course,
the gain through its audacity and talent in the world the highest
stages.

And Themselves? If they demand it? Do you think Victoria? Did not request it, which you thrown in
Rome at your feet, as I suspect, as you know them?

"

"So she did," said Victoria with an imploring voice.

"She endured your pure vision?

And seriously, do you want to give the man that she despised?

If it were my child, I vergrübe the monastery. But you are human and compassionate, Madonna.
And who knows, maybe she still loves him or loves him and hates the same time - I do not understand.
But I will accept her, she had the choice. "

Now the doctor opened the withered lips. "Poor Julia! What choice! Blessed are they relieved
of their is!

"What?" asked Pescara.

"Through a dark, but as God."

"I understand," the commander said quickly, "she is dead."

"You say, glory."

"She has done himself a mischief?" Victoria lamented.

"As her guardian angel was before!"

"Who knows? When she returned to her convent after she revealed to you, it is died. She must
have killed her confession, and the sight of your purity, Madonna, the glory as it wanted.
Maybe a heartbeat, perhaps - the willing girl to me in my pharmacy
often stood with understanding and skill.

"

Now ruled the commander: "It remains open to talks has made in the peace and. is now in service
and duty of a sacred power that our pathetic justice mocks. "

Victoria cried, and begged the old man, "I can not, it is good!"

"Yes, it's good," concluded the general.

Then he offered the hand of Victoria and said casually: "Madam, I have you and me, as long as
we should be together, prepared a brighter home than this old palace
with his clumsy Beamed ceilings, this apartment of treason, because
at its drawbridge, the Mohr delivered.

Behold your in the graceful pine Baute, Madonna there?

I have appointed you: they seemly clear your change. "

They crossed the park and arrived at the foot of the three flights
of stairs, where the aged doctor stopped, Breath-adding and the commander
back expecting.

Since Victoria ascended the third stairs, saw they have two images,
to which the right and left, the highest decorated stage.

"It was the young Francesco Sforza devised, on which his good taste is still the best, "chatted Pescara.
"These groups are pretty fleeting thoughts from his head. The right for instance. At first I could
not make head or tail of it, however much I liked it. As I said the gardeners the inscription,
which she wore at first, but they disappear the fine was Duke, so
that the Spectator feel and guess.

It read ... but that you bring out, sweetheart? "

Victoria, after a cursory look at the left group, an independent caressing
Couple had thrown a long time looking at the right.

There were two female figures one horizontal and something like a flower or a butterfly lightly
picking apart, and the others stood, deeply absorbed in themselves, or lost in the distance. All
three girls But the caressing, the forgotten, the yearning to have, among various prints the same
face. Victoria thought. Since your the commander deliberately blew in his ear, as in the School a boy,
a girl, "Do your eyes, a few letters are still legible." Victoria discovered the left, Mild
Pres ... right but they differed somewhat clearer: Ass .. "Presenza and Assenza," added she ashamed,
and the commander said: "The present is bold.

The absence, however, who forget, is thoughtless. I praise the current Absence: the longing.

"We
will have to part no more, Ferdinand, if you love me."

"Just once. For some days, more than a week, Madonna, and I will put Milan have. You follow
me, and henceforth, if you will, we no longer divide us.

It is to you to Victoria, "he said tenderly.

"Whether I want!"

"Do you remember, sweetheart," he joked again, "that you once I am babbling in Ischia Strande
said you do not understand how a woman who had loved ever a Second could belong to? It is contrary
to love, thou said sure, but it has experience and human nature itself. Assenza, Assenza! "

Now Victoria rose to its full stature and proud stretched his glorious
arm, by which the sleeves fell back against the bright sky, and swore:
"I never belonged to a others, for the pure rays of that sun!

"

The general soothingly: "There are your maids, child, and admire your vows they are not truly
imitate you. "He waved to the expectant at a respectful distance Maids and absent at the Marchesa. "You
will clothe, mistress, and myself have to do until the evening hour. See you here after sunset
to late supper. "

He turned and left without looking back at it themselves.

Bottom of the stairs he took the Arm of the aged doctor, slowly walking with him through a
cypress crossing to the castle.

"As the night was your lordship?" asked the old man.

"As usual," replied Pescara.

"You against your host have kept my secret, Numa?

"I am reminded of your command ... But how can you with the Chancellor
and my poor Italy this cruel game drive!

As you dürfet it? "

"I play with Italy, you say the contrary, your countrymen, Numa, play with me: they pretend
life and are dead in their transgressions and sins. "

They walked a while in silence. "You know, Numa," scoffed now the general, "that I has recently
visited an astrologer and I made the chart? He appreciated me at sixty Years, I found the little.
"

The old man sighed.

Again they walked in silence. Before the narrow gate of the castle on leave the old Pescara. "My
commanders expect me, Numa, I have allotted for this hour." Since crept it still a pity for
the good brown eyes and a toothless mouth, and he said kindly: "Fear not, Numa. I will not abuse your
Italy, I'll just and mild proceed. "

In his ante-room was the commander the Duke of Bourbon and Leyva are opposite, Del Guasto between
them, as if he held them apart, and then a fourth, the leaned in a window sill. This was a great
man in years, half monk, half Man of the world, with a bronze head and deep, unfathomable moves
into a cowl-like white coat wrapped.

How Pescara saw him, the commander seemed to shudder slightly, however,
went up to him and greeted him.

"What I owe the honor, Moncada?"

The other replied: "Your excellency, I am sending and requesting,
on behalf of the Viceroy to an interview.

"

"I grant," replied the captain, "but I beg your grace to be brief
on the eve of the campaign.

"

"A private interview."

Pescara remembered. "A secret? Not Knight. Professional I would these two Gentlemen, my colleagues,
not denied. Ersparet me the trouble.

My nephew here is silent. What is your mission? And say, Knight! "He offered a chair Moncada.

This looked at the faces of those present.

"According to your will," he said. "Your excellency, the viceroy is in the deepest concern.
The Italian league is not a fact which His Grace, doubt, as you did
by Leyva ask the Viceroy to troops, which of course can not spare
even their needs, in the event of war breaking out an awesome, to
make but threatening movement against astray or misguided holiness.

Illustrious admits that our armies in the south and north of the peninsula cooperatively in
the same plan need to intervene.

In this sense, the Viceroy sent me to accompany you and him to keep informed. Approved Grace?
"

The general said yes, his displeasure down fighting.

"Another," continued Moncada.

"I am sorry that you do not receive habet secret but I seize the moment. It is desired in Madrid,
that His Grace, you Milan conquered, is there for the good of the monarchy, and to eradicate the
evil by the roots, strictly and thoroughly proceed.

It is advised: the renegade Duke would in chains down and sent to Spain, and the defiant nobility
of Lombardy lose his property and climb the scaffold; strong crew and heavy-volume civil war
tax, and the terror reign in Milan! "He was looking in the face of the commander to read.

This was quiet. "The terror?" he repeated. "Never, as long as I live and my Kaiser served! Milan is
the Reich, and the emperor does not mean that abused the kingdom am. Who wants? Who advises? Spared me
with councils and desires, Moncada, I need they do not. "

"The Duke has asked for a delay?" Moncada asked suspiciously.

"No, knight."

"Through his chancellor?"

"The Chancellor of the sovereignty of Milan inhabited since the castle today. Your Grace can speak
to him and ask him for yourself, it will make it a pleasure because I'm afraid that he is
bored. "

"His Highness has asked him not receive? No curiosity left me, but
the interest the royal cause, which we are all here.

"

"I have spoken to the chancellor, this morning, two hours."

This sincerity Moncada was astonished, but she said nothing new. He was by the prying ears, which
he under the salaried servants of Pescara, from arrival and inform the audience exactly Morones.

"A long persuasion, but there could be only on the submission of the Duke of the question."

Pescara silent. Secret disgust, it seemed, forbade him, the only one standing in front of him
to appreciate the word beyond what was necessary.

"I am surprised, 'continued Moncada," that His Grace is not cut short, and I was astonished,
that you received this wicked at all, now that those lies about Italy
meet Grace.

"

"No more! Each word is an insult and a waste of time, I had this lies my Kaiser reported. That
is enough. I know my enemies ... "

"Way. And just as if your conversation with His Highness Morone unsuspecting witnesses would have
been. "
"This happened", Pescara replied contemptuously. "These gentlemen
here." Bourbon and Del Guasto nodded. "As for the content of the conversation,
after which your curious seems to be, and you will see him the answer
that I was in your presence, if You wish it to give the chancellor
tomorrow am willing, before my Heerzug as a prisoner will follow.
Here in this hall. But now I leave you. "And he withdrew into his
inner chamber, while the three others followed him.

Moncada stood
alone. "A mask," he reflected, "an elaborate mask. What a face hide
them? ... I will know it ... You do not escape me, I do hover, Pescara!
" He walked slowly away in conflicting thoughts.

While the three
generals inside the war prepared, the vestibule was empty for a while
and unguarded. The Page Ippolito had sneaked over to the lady, whose
arrival He had watched and admired the beauty and affability he childlike.
He was burning, to greet them and to offer his services. But then
populated the solemn Room with a funny society. The five silver gray
wind chimes of the Constable, foolish, very young animals had found
any unguarded entrance to the castle and beschnoberten Now the columns
of the door, behind which they suspected their Lord. This race was
a fashion thing. Then came the Greyhound of the Marchese, a noble
animal and a tireless runner, to see what was the matter, and was
not built by this reckless clan, which he is not in this serious space
seemed to belong and to which he manifested his displeasure growling.

Behold,
there appeared a delicate, graceful greyhound, a snow-white creature
of the finest forms, which bore on the shimmering silver collar inscribed
"I belong to the Victoria Colonna. " First received with joy and admiration,
the toy was pretty soon a hunted and hunted deer, behind which the
whole youthful crowd yelping in Circles whirled around. Then came
the Page jumped in, took the property of the mistress, which he might
have sent, and then, in the arms and fled there from the riots, the
wild chase dragging behind him, except the prudent runner of Pescara.
At the same moment Leyva came from the inner chamber and accelerated
the general flight, by the rearmost Constable said the little dog
a kick that it flew through the air and whimpering.

The gray-haired
general had an angry red face and was of Pescara, who led, hardly
hold back the hand. "Leyva," said the Marchese, "I beg you, stay!
Beherrschet you! I can not force you, against the Duke to be just,
but observed at least the forms! The Duke behaves admirably against
you, with impeccable courtesy, But you zoget him the grinning face
of a farmer, and now you run away before our consultation closed.
This is not a behavior, as befits your position and your credit. "
"I could no longer endure the Traitors, Pescara! With every look,
every movement I offended the proud man! Nothing but contempt! His
cold despises me, and his bows my sneer. I want to know where he gets
the right to look down on me. I am above him, despite his high birth,
because my honor is pure, and I am a faithful servant my king, but
he has betrayed his own people! He is drawn, and his smooth face nastier
than my wound here! But not all the princes despise me, there is that
which know my worth. So this intelligent Moncada, with whom I traveled.
The least I have appreciated his confidence. "

Pescara was very serious.
"Leyva," he said, "You Give me the satisfaction that I always you
have taken seriously. I do not ask for the birth, but I take people
how I did try. Habet me your ever seen or invented little arrogant
thinking? You nothing against me, old, "he said confidentially," we
know each other. "He was looking with the light gray eyes of the Mitfeldherrn,
who but him, his head lowering escaped, obstinate. "Nothing," Leyva
grumbled, "except that you keep friendship with the other but I am
in a hurry. Highness send me the instructions after. I like like to
own writing. Leyva is doing his duty. Count on it! "  As no subject would probably
be considered more than once in committee of the whole, in an ordinary society, the enforcement
of this rule would practically prevent such a society from putting any limit to debate in the
committee.  The rule as given above, allows the society, whenever resolving itself into committee
of the whole, to impose upon the debate in the committee, such restrictions as are allowed
in Congress after the subject has already been considered in committee of the whole.]

If no limit is prescribed, any member may speak as often as he can get the floor, and as long
each time as allowed in debate in the assembly, provided no one wishes the floor who has not
spoken on that particular question.  Debate having been closed at a particular time by order
of the assembly, it is not competent for the committee, even by unanimous consent, to extend
the time.  The committee cannot refer the subject to another committee.  Like other committees
[§ 28], it cannot alter the text of any resolution referred to it; but if the resolution originated
in the committee, then all the amendments are incorporated in it.

When it is through with the consideration of the subject referred to it, or if it wishes to
adjourn, or to have the assembly limit debate, a motion is made that "the committee rise and
report," etc., specifying the result of its proceedings.

=== Page 64 ============================================================

This motion "to rise" is equivalent to the motion to adjourn, in the assembly, and is always
in order (except when another member has the floor), and is undebatable.  As soon as this motion
is adopted, the presiding officer takes the chair, and the chairman of the committee, having
resumed his place in the assembly, arises and informs him, that "the committee have gone through
the business referred to them, and that he is ready to make the report, when the assembly is
ready to receive it;" or he will make such other report as will suit the case.

The clerk does not record the proceedings of the committee on the minutes, but should keep
a memorandum of the proceedings for the use of the committee.  In large assemblies the clerk
vacates his chair, which is occupied by the chairman of the committee, and the assistant clerk
acts as clerk of the committee.  Should the committee get disorderly, and the chairman be unable
to preserve order, the presiding officer can take the chair, and declare the committee dissolved.
The quorum of the committee of the whole is the same as that of the assembly [§ 43].  If the
committee finds itself without a quorum, it can only rise and report the fact to the assembly,
which in such a case would have to adjourn.

=== Page 65 ============================================================

33. Informal Consideration of a Question (or acting as if in committee of the whole).

It has become customary in many assemblies, instead of going into committee of the whole, to
consider the question "informally," and afterwards to act "formally."  In a small assembly
there is no objection to this.* [In the U. S. Senate all bills, joint resolutions and treaties,
upon their second reading are considered "as if the Senate were in committee of the whole,"
which is equivalent to considering them informally.  [U. S. Senate Rules 28 and 38.]  In large
assemblies it is better to follow the practice of the House of Representatives, and go into
committee of the whole.] While acting informally upon any resolutions, the assembly can only
amend and adopt them, and without further motion the Chairman announces that "the assembly
acting informally [or as in committee of the whole] has had such a subject under consideration,
and has made certain amendments, which he will report."  The subject comes before the assembly
then as if reported by a committee.  While acting informally, the Chairman retains his seat,
as it is not necessary to move that the committee rise, but at any time the adoption of such
motions as to adjourn, the previous question, to commit, or any motion except to amend or adopt,
puts an end to the informal consideration; as for example, the motion to commit is equivalent
to the following motions when in committee of the whole:  (1) That the committee rise; (2)
that the committee of

=== Page 66 ============================================================

the whole be discharged from the further consideration of the subject, and (3) that it be referred
to a committee.

While acting informally, every member can speak as many times as he pleases, and as long each
time as permitted in the assembly [§ 34], and the informal action may be rejected or altered
by the assembly.  While the clerk should keep a memorandum of the informal proceedings, it
should not be entered on the minutes, being only for temporary use.  The Chairman's report
to the assembly of the informal action, should be entered on the minutes, as it belongs to
the assembly's proceedings.

Art. V. Debate and Decorum.

[§§ 34-37.]

34. Debate.* [In connection with this section read §§ 1-5.] When a motion is made and seconded,
it shall be stated by the Chairman before being debated [see § 3].  When any member is about
to speak in debate, he shall rise and respectfully address himself to "Mr. Chairman." ["Mr.
President" is used where that is the designated title of the presiding

=== Page 67 ============================================================

officer; "Brother Moderator" is more common in religious meetings.] The Chairman shall then
announce his name [see § 2].  By parliamentary courtesy, the member upon whose motion a subject
is brought before the assembly is first entitled to the floor, even though another member has
risen first and addressed the Chair; [in case of a report of a committee, it is the member
who presents the report] ; and this member is also entitled to close the debate, but not until
every member choosing to speak, has spoken.  This right to make the last speech upon the question,
is not taken away by the Previous Question [§ 20] being ordered, or in any other way.  With
this exception, no member shall speak more than twice to the same question (only once to a
question of order, § 14), nor longer than ten minutes at one time, without leave of the assembly,
and the question upon granting the leave shall be decided by a majority vote without debate.*
[The limit in time should vary to suit circumstances, but the limit of two speeches of ten
minutes each will usually answer in ordinary assemblies, and it can be increased, when desirable,
by a majority vote as shown above, or diminished as shown in § 37.  In the U. S. House of Representatives
no member can speak more than once to the same question, nor longer than one hour. The fourth
rule of the Senate is as follows:  "No Senator shall speak more than twice in any one debate
on the same day, without leave of the Senate, which question shall be decided without debate."
If no rule is adopted, each member can speak but once to the same question.]

If greater freedom is desired, the

=== Page 68 ============================================================

proper course is to refer the subject to the committee of the whole [§ 32], or to consider
it informally [§ 33].  [For limiting or closing the debate, see § 37.] No member can speak
the second time to a question, until every member choosing to speak has spoken.  But an amendment,
or any other motion being offered, makes the real question before the assembly a different
one, and, in regard to the right to debate, is treated as a new question.  Merely asking a
question, or making a suggestion, is not considered as speaking.

35. Undebatable Questions.  The following questions shall be decided without debate, all others
being debatable [see note at end of this section]:

  To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn (when a
privileged question, § 10).
  To Adjourn [§ 11], (or in committee, to rise, which is used instead
of to adjourn).
  For the Orders of the Day [§ 13], and questions relating to the
priority of business.
  An Appeal [§ 14] when made while the Previous Question is pending,
or when simply relating to indecorum or transgressions of the rules of
speaking, or to the priority of business.
  Objection to the Consideration of a Question [§ 15].

=== Page 69 ============================================================

  Questions relating to Reading of Papers [§ 16], or Withdrawing a
Motion [§ 17], or Suspending the Rules [§ 18], or extending the limits
of debate [§ 34], or limiting or closing debate, or granting leave to
continue his speech to one who has been guilty of indecorum in debate
[§ 36].
  To Lie on the Table or to Take from the Table [§ 19].
  The Previous Question [§ 20].
  To Reconsider [§ 26] a question which is itself undebatable.

The motion to Postpone to a certain time [§ 21] allows of but very limited debate, which must
be confined to the propriety of the postponement; but to Reconsider a debatable question [§
26], or to Commit [§ 22], or Indefinitely Postpone [§ 24], opens the main question [§ 6] to
debate.  To Amend [§ 23] opens the main question to debate only so far as it is necessarily
involved in the amendment.

The distinction between debate and making suggestions or asking a question, should always be
kept in view, and when the latter will assist the assembly in determining the question, is
allowed to a limited extent, even though the question before the assembly is undebatable.

Note On Undebatable Questions.--The English common parliamentary law makes all motions

=== Page 70 ============================================================

debatable, without there is a rule adopted limiting debate [Cushing's Manual, § 330]; but every
assembly is obliged to restrict debate upon certain motions.  The restrictions to debate prescribed
in this section conform to the practice of Congress, where, however, it is very common to allow
of brief remarks upon the most undebatable questions, sometimes five or six members speaking;
this of course is allowed only when no one objects.

By examining the above list, it will be found, that, while free debate is allowed upon every
principal question [§ 6], it is permitted or prohibited upon other questions in accordance
with the following principles:

(a) Highly privileged questions, as a rule, should not be debated, as in that case they could
be used to prevent the assembly from coming to a vote on the main question; (for instance,
if the motion to adjourn were debatable, it could be used [see § 11] in a way to greatly hinder
business).  High privilege is, as a rule, incompatible with the right of debate on the privileged
question.

(b) A motion that has the effect to suppress a question before the assembly, so that it cannot
again be taken up that session [§ 42], allows of free debate.  And a subsidiary motion [§ 7,
except commit, which see below,] is debatable to just the extent that it interferes with the
right of the assembly to take up the original question at its pleasure.

Illustrations:  To "Indefinitely Postpone" [§ 24] a question, places it out of the power of
the assembly to again take it up during that session, and consequently this motion allows of
free debate, even involving the whole merits of the original question.

To "Postpone to a certain time" prevents the assembly taking up the question till the specified
time, and therefore allows of limited debate upon the propriety of the postponement.

To "Lie on the Table" leaves the question so

=== Page 71 ============================================================

that the assembly can at any time consider it, and therefore should not be, and is not debatable.

To "Commit" would not be very debatable, according to this rule, but it is an exception, because
it is often important that the committee should know the views of the assembly on the question,
and it therefore is not only debatable, but opens to debate the whole question which it is
proposed to refer to the committee.

36. Decorum in Debate [see § 2].  In debate a member must confine himself to the question before
the assembly, and avoid personalities. He cannot reflect upon any act of the assembly, unless
he intends to conclude his remarks with a motion to rescind such action, or else while debating
such motion.  In referring to another member, he should, as much as possible, avoid using his
name, rather referring to him as "the member who spoke last," or in some other way describing
him.  The officers of the assembly should always be referred to by their official titles. 
It is not allowable to arraign the motives of a member, but the nature or consequences of a
measure may be condemned in strong terms. It is not the man, but the measure, that is the subject
of debate.  If at any time the Chairman rises to state a point of order, or give information,
or otherwise speak, within his privilege [see

=== Page 72 ============================================================

§ 40], the member speaking must take his seat till the Chairman has been first heard.  When
called to order, the member must sit down until the question of order is decided.  If his remarks
are decided to be improper, he cannot proceed, if any one objects, without the leave of the
assembly expressed by a vote, upon which question there shall be no debate.

Disorderly words should be taken down by the member who objects to them, or by the clerk, and
then read to the member; if he denies them, the assembly shall decide by a vote whether they
are his words or not.  If a member cannot justify the words he used, and will not suitably
apologize for using them, it is the duty of the assembly to act in the case, requiring both
members to withdraw* [If both are personally interested. [See page 161.]] till it has decided
its course, it being a general rule that no member should he present in the assembly when any
matter relating to himself is under debate.  If any business has taken place since the member
spoke, it is too late to take notice of any disorderly words he used.

37. Closing Debate.  Debate upon a question is not closed by the Chairman rising to put the
question, as, until both the affirmative

=== Page 73 ============================================================

and negative are put, a member can claim the floor, and re-open debate [see § 38].  Debate
can be closed by the following motions, which are undebatable [§ 35], and, except to Lie on
the Table, shall require a two-thirds* [In Congress, where each speaker can occupy the floor
one hour, any of these motions to cut off debate can be adopted by a mere majority.  In ordinary
societies harmony is so essential, that a two-thirds vote should be required to force the assembly
to a final vote without allowing free debate.] vote for their adoption [§ 39]:

  (a) An objection to the consideration of a question [only allowable
when the question is first introduced, § 15], which, if sustained, not only
stops debate, but also throws the subject out of the assembly for that
session [§ 42]; which latter effect is the one for which it was
designed.

  (b) To lie on the table [§ 19], which, if adopted, carries the
question to the table, from which it cannot be taken without a majority
favors such action.

  (c) The previous question [§ 20], which has the effect of requiring
all the questions before the assembly [excepting as limited in § 20] to
be put to vote at once without further debate.  It may be applied merely
to an amendment or to an amendment of an amendment.

=== Page 74 ============================================================

  (d) For the assembly to adopt an order (1) limiting debate upon a
special subject, either as to the number or length of the speeches; or
(2) closing debate upon the subject at a stated time, when all pending
questions shall be put to vote without further debate.  Either of these
two measures may be applied only to a pending amendment, or an amendment
thereto, and when this is voted upon, the original question is still
open to debate and amendment.

Art. VI.  Vote. [§§ 38-39.]

38. Voting.  Whenever from the nature of the question it permits of no modification or debate,
the Chairman immediately puts it to vote; if the question is debatable, when the Chairman thinks
the debate has been brought to a close, he should inquire if the assembly is ready for the
question, and if no one rises he puts the question to vote.  There are various forms for putting
the question, in use in different parts of the country.  The rule in Congress, in

=== Page 75 ============================================================

the House of Representatives, is as follows:  "Questions shall be distinctly put in this form,
to-wit:  'As many as are of the opinion that (as the question may be) say Aye;' and after the
affirmative voice is expressed, 'As many as are of the contrary opinion, say No.'"  The following
form is very common:  "It has been moved and seconded that (here state the question).  As many
as are favor of the motion say Aye; those opposed, No."  Or, if the motion is for the adoption
of a certain resolution, after it has been read the Chairman can say, "You have heard the resolution
read; those in favor of its adoption will hold up the right hand; those opposed will manifest
it by the same sign."  These examples are sufficient to show the usual methods of putting a
question, the affirmative being always put first.

When a vote is taken, the Chairman should always announce the result in the following form:
"The motion is carried--the resolution is adopted," or, "The ayes have it--the resolution is
adopted."  If, when he announces a vote, any member rises and states that he doubts the vote,
or calls for a "division," the

=== Page 76 ============================================================

Chairman shall say, "A division is called for; those in favor of the motion will rise."  After
counting these, and announcing the number, he shall say, "Those opposed will rise." will count
these, announce the number, and declare the result; that is, whether the motion is carried
or lost.  Instead of counting the vote himself, he can appoint tellers to make the count and
report to him.  When tellers are appointed, they should be selected from both sides of the
question.  A member has the right to change his vote (when not made by ballot) before the decision
of the question has been finally and conclusively pronounced by the Chair, but not afterwards.

Until the negative is put, it is in order for any member, in the same manner as if the voting
had not been commenced, to rise and speak, make motions for amendment or otherwise, and thus
renew the debate; and this, whether the member was in the assembly room or not when the question
was put and the vote partly taken.  In such case the question is in the same condition as if
it had never been put.

No one can vote on a question affecting

=== Page 77 ============================================================

himself, but if more than one name is included in the resolution (though a sense of delicacy
would prevent this right being exercised, excepting when it would change the vote) all are
entitled to vote; for if this were not so, a minority could control an assembly by including
the names of a sufficient number in a motion, say for preferring charges against them, and
suspend them, or even expel them from the assembly.  When there is a tie vote the motion fails,
without the Chairman gives his vote for the affirmative, which in such case he can do.  Where
his vote will make a tie, he can cast it and thus defeat the measure.

Another form of voting is by ballot.  This method is only adopted when required by the constitution
or by-laws of the assembly, or when the assembly has ordered the vote to be so taken.  The
Chairman, in such cases, appoints at least two tellers, who distribute slips of paper upon
which each member, including the Chairman,* [Should the Chairman neglect to vote before the
ballots are counted, he cannot then vote without the permission of the assembly.] writes his
vote; the votes are then collected, counted by the tellers, and the result reported to the
Chairman, who announces

=== Page 78 ============================================================

it to the assembly.  The Chairman announces the result of the vote, in case of an election
to office, in a manner similar to the following: "The whole number of votes cast is --; the
number necessary for an election is --; Mr. A. received --; Mr. B. --; Mr. C. --.  Mr. B. having
received the required number is elected --."  Where there is only one candidate for an office,
and the constitution requires the vote to be by ballot, it is common to authorize the clerk
to cast the vote of the assembly for such and such a person; if any one objects however, it
is necessary to ballot in the usual way.  So when a motion is made to make a vote unanimous,
it fails if any one objects.  In counting the ballots all blanks are ignored.

The assembly can by a majority vote order that the vote on any question be taken by Yeas and
Nays.* [Taking a vote by yeas and nays, which has the effect to place on the record how each
member votes, is peculiar to this country, and while it consumes a great deal of time, is rarely
useful in ordinary societies.  By the Constitution, one-fifth of the members present can, in
either house of Congress, order a vote to be taken by yeas and nays, and to avoid some of the
resulting inconveniences various rules and customs have been established, which are ignored
in this Manual, as according to it the yeas and nays can only be ordered by a majority, which
prevents its being made use of to hinder business.  In representative bodies it is very useful,
especially where the proceedings are published, as it enables the people to know how their
representatives voted on important measures.  In some small bodies a vote on a resolution must
be taken by yeas and nays, upon the demand of a single member.] In this method of voting the
Chairman states both sides of the question

=== Page 79 ============================================================

at once; the clerk calls the roll and each member as his name is called rises and answers yes
or no, and the clerk notes his answer.  Upon the completion of the roll call the clerk reads
over the names of those who answered the affirmative, and afterwards those in the negative,
that mistakes may be corrected; he then gives the number voting on each side to the Chairman,
who announces the result.  An entry must be made in the minutes of the names of all voting
in the affirmative, and also of those in the negative.

The form of putting a question upon which the vote has been ordered to be taken by yeas and
nays, is similar to the following:  "As many as are in favor of the adoption of these resolutions
will, when their names are called, answer yes [or aye]--those opposed will answer no."  The
Chairman will then direct the clerk to call the roll.  The negative being put at the same time
as the affirmative, it is too late, after the question is put, to renew the

=== Page 80 ============================================================

debate.  After the commencement of the roll call, it is too late to ask to be excused from
voting.  The yeas and nays cannot be ordered in committee of the whole [§ 32].

39. Motions Requiring More than a Majority Vote.* [Where no rule to the contrary is adopted,
a majority vote of the assembly, when a quorum [§ 43] is present, is sufficient for the adoption
of any motion, except for the suspension of a rule, which can only be done by general consent,
or unanimously.  Congress requires a two-thirds vote for only the motions to suspend and to
amend the Rules, to take up business out of its proper order, and to make a special order [see
note to § 37].] The following motions shall require a two-thirds vote for their adoption, as
the right of discussion, and the right to have the rules enforced, should not be abridged by
a mere majority:

  An Objection to the Consideration of a Question .............. § 15.
  To Take up a Question out of its proper order ................ § 13.
  To Suspend the Rules ......................................... § 18.
  The Previous Question ........................................ § 20.
  To Close or Limit Debate ..................................... § 37.
  To Amend the Rules (requires previous notice also) ........... § 43.
  To Make a special order ...................................... § 13.

=== Page 81 ============================================================

Art. VII.  The Officers and the Minutes. [§§ 40, 41.]

40. Chairman* [In connection with this section read § 44, and also § 40, 41.] or President.
The presiding officer, when no special title has been assigned him, is ordinarily called the
Chairman (or in religious assemblies more usually the Moderator); frequently the constitution
of the assembly prescribes for him a title, such as President.

His duties are generally as follows:

To open the session at the time at which the assembly is to meet, by taking the chair and calling
the members to order; to announce the business before the assembly in the order in which it
is to be acted upon [§ 44]; to state and to put to vote [§ 38] all questions which are regularly
moved, or necessarily arise in the course of proceedings, and to announce the result of the vote;

To restrain the members, when engaged in

=== Page 82 ============================================================

debate, within the rules of order; to enforce on all occasions the observance of order and
decorum [§ 36] among the members, deciding all questions of order (subject to an appeal to
the assembly by any two members, § 14), and to inform the assembly when necessary, or when
referred to for the purpose, on a point of order or practice;

To authenticate, by his signature, when necessary, all the acts, orders and proceedings of
the assembly, and in general to represent and stand for the assembly, declaring its will, and
in all things obeying its commands.

The chairman shall rise* [It is not customary for the chairman to rise while putting questions
in very small bodies, such as committees, boards of trustees, &c.] to put a question to vote,
but may state it sitting; he shall also rise from his seat (without calling any one to the
chair), when speaking to a question of order, which he can do in preference to other members.
In referring to himself he should always use his official title thus:  "The Chair decides so
and so," not "I decide, &c."  When a member has the floor, the chairman cannot interrupt him
as long as he does not transgress

=== Page 83 ============================================================

any of the rules of the assembly, excepting as provided in § 2.

He is entitled to vote when the vote is by ballot,* [But this right is lost if he does not
use it before the tellers have commenced to count the ballots.  The assembly can give leave
to the chairman to vote under such circumstances.] and in all other cases where the vote would
change the result.  Thus in a case where two-thirds vote is necessary, and his vote thrown
with the minority would prevent the adoption of the question, he can cast his vote; so also
he can vote with the minority when it will produce a tie vote and thus cause the motion to
fail. Whenever a motion is made referring especially to the chairman, the maker of the motion
should put it to vote.

The chairman can, if it is necessary to vacate the chair, appoint a chairman pro tem.,** [When
there are Vice Presidents, then the first one on the list that is present, is, by virtue of
his office, chairman during the absence of the President, and should always be called to the
chair when the President temporarily vacates it.] but the first adjournment puts an end to
the appointment, which the assembly can terminate before, if it pleases, by electing another
chairman.  But the regular chairman, knowing that he will be absent from a future meeting,
cannot authorize another member to act

=== Page 84 ============================================================

in his place at such meeting; the clerk [§ 41], or in his absence any member, should in such
case call the meeting to order, and a chairman pro tem. be elected, who would hold office during
that session [§ 42], without such office was terminated by the entrance of the regular chairman.

The chairman sometimes calls a member to the chair, and himself takes part in the debate. 
But this should rarely be done, and nothing can justify it in a case where much feeling is
shown, and there is a liability to difficulty in preserving order.  If the chairman has even
the appearance of being a partisan, he loses much of his ability to control those who are on
the opposite side of the question.* [The unfortunate habit many chairmen have of constantly
speaking upon questions before the assembly, even interrupting the member who has the floor,
is unjustified by either the common parliamentary law, or the practice of Congress.  One who
expects to take an active part in debate should never accept the chair.  "It is a general rule,
in all deliberative assemblies, that the presiding officer shall not participate in the debate,
or other proceedings, in any other capacity than as such officer.  He is only allowed, therefore,
to state matters of fact within his knowledge; to inform the assembly on points of order or
the course of proceeding, when called upon for that purpose, or when he finds it necessary
to do so; and on appeals from his decision on questions of order, to address the assembly in
debate."  [Cushing's Manual, page 106.] "Though the Speaker [chairman] may of right speak to
matters of order and be first heard, he is restrained from speaking on any other subject except
where the assembly have occasion for facts within his knowledge; then he may, with their leave,
state the matter of fact."  [Jefferson's Manual, sec. xvii, and Barclay's "Digest of the Rules
and Practice of the House of Representatives, U. S.," page 195.]]

The chairman should not only be familiar with parliamentary usage, and set the example of strict
conformity to it, but he should be a

=== Page 85 ============================================================

man of executive ability, capable of controlling men; and it should never be forgotten, that,
to control others, it is necessary to control one's self.  An excited chairman can scarcely
fail to cause trouble in a meeting.

A chairman will often find himself perplexed with the difficulties attending his position,
and in such cases he will do well to heed the advice of a distinguished writer on parliamentary
law, and recollect that--"The great purpose of all rules and forms, is to subserve the will
of the assembly, rather than to restrain it; to facilitate, and not to obstruct, the expression
of their deliberate sense."

41. Clerk or Secretary [and the Minutes].  The recording officer is usually called

=== Page 86 ============================================================

the "Clerk" or "Secretary,"* [When there are two secretaries, he is termed the "recording secretary,"
and the other one, the "corresponding secretary."  In many societies the secretary, besides
acting as recording officer, collects the dues of members, and thus becomes to a certain extent
a financial officer.  In most cases the treasurer acts as banker, only paying on the order
of the society, signed by the secretary alone, or by the president and secretary.  In such
cases the secretary becomes in reality the financial officer of the society, and should make
reports to the society, of funds received and from what sources, and of the funds expended
and for what purposes.  See § 52 for his duties as financial officer.] and the record of proceedings
the "Minutes."  His desk should be near that of the chairman, and in the absence of the chairman,
(if there is no vice president present) when the hour for opening the session arrives, it is
his duty to call the meeting to order, and to preside until the election of a chairman pro
tem., which should be done immediately.  He should keep a record of the proceedings, commencing
in a form similar to the following :** [See Clerk and Minutes in Part II, § 51.]

"At a regular quarterly meeting of [state the name of the society] held on the 31st day of
March, 1875, at [state the place of meeting], the President in the chair, the minutes were
read by the clerk and approved."  If the regular clerk is absent, insert after the words "in
the chair," the following:  "The clerk being absent, Robert Smith was appointed clerk pro tem.

=== Page 87 ============================================================

The minutes were then read and approved."  If the minutes were not read, say "the reading of
the minutes was dispensed with." Because you are superior to him, do you think of the things themselves.
The weather in Madrid but makes the Bourbon, the wasteful Constable, of the gold with both
hands and throws his loyalty is beyond all suspicion, because he's king Francis has betrayed
and is now doomed for ever to the service of the emperor. The Bourbon but wants to Milan. Your
feud is promised him. He is a Gonzaga from the mother and her strives for an Italian throne.
Why can not decide the Emperor up to borrow after you have paid him hundreds of thousands? Because
he is your Milan the Borbone zudenkt, after I take poison. This is sure about it. Recently,
as you see me in the send test imperial camp, he has overwhelmed me with caresses and nearly
sent me a Bag slipped to prepare myself for the opportune moment. For sure, we are old Known
by the French government here. "

That was a lie and truth, the Constable was in a great mood wine a funny incident his guest royally
rewarded.

"And you took, monster?" horrified the Duke.

"With the best conscience in the world," Morone said lightly. "Do not you know, Frank, teachings
of the casuists that a woman may take as much as it gives her, if only maintains her virtue?
This also applies to ministers and allowed me to in this barren time
to give also to my salary.

But you can sometimes buy you a good picture, Francine. You also need to have your honest delight.
"

Sforza was pale. The specter of Bourbon in his castle and in his kingdom, which both of these
before - before his famous betrayal - for years as a French governor possessed, had brought him
to all his senses.

"I have always believed, and it haunts me at every turn, "wailed the poor," that will have the Borbone
my Milan. Save I, Girolamo! Close your league! without delay! Otherwise I'm lost. "He jumped
up and took the chancellor by the arm.

He replied calmly: "Yes, it's not as fast, but perhaps is Francine. today can still do something
for it. It happens. Yesterday the Nasi excellence - not of Horatius, but the beautiful Laelius
- in our changer Lolli has gone, and by a serendipity Guicciardin
also arrived here, despite its bristles in the Vatican pleasant person.

With these two intelligent people could be persuaded, and I have the
Venetians and the Florentines to your dinner table loaded because
I know you are a harmless Conversation and a fun loving society.

"

"O cursed, worthless conspiracy!" accused the Duke fickle.

"And yet another well broken in, at dawn.

This has to the third Hours in the afternoon announced, he would sleep in the first place.
"

"Another?" What other? " The Duke shook.

"The Bourbon."

"God pollute the pale traitors!" shouted Sforza. "What is he doing here?"

"He will even tell you. Hark! It ringing vespers in the cathedral."

"Receiving you see him, Chancellor!" implored the Duke and wanted to escape through a door.
Morone but he was seized by the arm and led him back to his chair.
"I ask, Your Highness!

It is over. When the Constable occurs to raise the sovereignty and receive it standing. The
shortens.

"He clothed with his Lord on the chair hung-coat, and this gradually took to combat his fear
of a royal attitude, by his charming Grew up and claimed the natural
decency he had.

Meanwhile, the chancellor looked through the window that the Palace Square and behind it the outline of
the newly planted ramparts of the fort was. "Delicious!" he said.

"Since is this true-hearted Constable, ten steps ahead of his followers, and features ease our new jump
in his pocket. I will go and introduce him. "

Since he came to Morone, the famous traitor, a lean, tall figure and a proud, colorless head
with fine features and striking dark eyes, a weird but great Appearance, he bowed politely to Francesco
Sforza, who shyly looked.

"Highness," said Charles Bourbon, "I testify my respect guilty and ask for hearing for a message
of His Imperial Majesty. "

Duke Franz replied with dignity that he was prepared to the will of its exalted feudal lord awesome
to hear staggered, and then slipped back into his chair.

When the constable saw the Duke to sit down, he too looked for a chair or at least according to a
stool. Nothing like that was available and no page at present.

Since He threw his precious jacket to the Duke against the marble floor and pitched smooth, the left
arm resting, putting in the right hip. "Allow sovereignty," he said.

Karl Bourbon lived since his betrayal in a scorching and consuming
atmosphere of self-hatred.

Nobody, even the most distinguished have not dared to even the proud man with an air to remember
his actions and let him guess the verdict, which public opinion his
century had taken unanimously and with unusual hardship on him, but
he knew this severe sentence, and his conscience is confirmed.

The most thorough contempt for human beings he did, beginning with himself, contrary to the whole
world, but he controlled himself completely and no one acted and spoke perfect free colorless,
all mockery, irony, even the slightest allusion to, and hence the other under meaningless. Rarely
told how a suddenly jerking out of the ground fire, a hell of a cynical joke or fun the state
his soul.

After a while the Constable minded, he began with a pleasant voice
and a slight Turn of the head: "I ask sovereignty, to pay for me to
leave my mission was unwelcome might have for you.

Myself completely back centering, I provide a territorial Decision of the Imperial Majesty,
which has taken the same in their Ministers, however, after hearing of her three Italian commander,
Pescara, Leyva and my allegiance. "

"How is Pescara? asked the Chancellor, who at the same distance from
the two jurisdictions stood, bold in between.

"Is he cured of his spear wound in Pavia?"

"Friend," the constable replied contemptuously, "I beg you not to speak, where You will not be asked.
"

Then took the Duke to the question. "Mr. Constable," he said, "is how the winner Pavia? "

Bourbon bowed binding. "I thank you for the gracious sovereignty of the demand. My illustrious
and beloved colleague, Ferdinand marquis of Pescara Avalos is perfectly manufactured. . He
rides without complaint his ten hours "Then he continued:" Let me
now to business come, Your Highness.

Bitter medicine will be passed quickly. The Imperial Majesty's wishes much that the sovereignty of
retreating from the new league that provides you with the holiness, the crowns concluded by
France and England and the Republic of Venice or to complete the Tag is. "

Now was the Lord of Milan the flow of speech and protested with a well-feigned astonishment
and sincere, that his indignation by such a league was not aware and self- certainly the first
would be to inform without delay after his feud duty to the emperor, if his knowledge would be spun
in northern Italy against the majesty of this kind.

And he laid hand on the cowardly heart.

With pre-bent head listening politely, the Constable was the young
hypocrite his lie Repeat in new twists.

Then he replied in a cool tone, with an imperceptible Staining contemptuous pity: "The words intact
the sovereignty, I must believe that the same of the situation is not accurately informed. We think it to be
better. Peace between France and England with an evil intention against the emperor, a fact that
we has been reported with certainty from the Netherlands. Just as certain are we that in northern
Italy is prepared against us.

And as far as the Holy Father can judge, it seems, the spoils we have to turn to face down against
us. To distinguish between what did and If, in what is, may not be our task: before we build.
Before the league, "he added significant in a lower voice, adding, "has found a commander."

Then he presented his claim "sovereignty gives us security, within a month that you Neutrality holds.
This is the entreaty from Imperial Majesty. "Security, but understands them: the adoption of
the Swiss, leave the Lombard weapons by half, setting any and all fortifications and provision
of this ingenious man "- he pointed with the head sideways - "on Imperial Majesty can not go." -
and he rose up violently, as He wanted to jump on horseback - "not blow out, we to leave for
the last September at Midnight, an hour earlier, not later, and fill in a few marches the duchy.
Consider sovereignty. "He bowed and retired.

Then he wanted to give the escort Morone, Bourbon fell into one of his great mood and had Registrar
with a farcical gesture from. "Adieu, mon ami Pantalon!" he called on the Shoulders back.

Morone flew into a rage about this title, what to speak of his person all the seriousness and
value seemed, and indignantly up and down borders, he entangled himself with his feet in the broken-
Jacket of the constable, and the young duke but held on to the Chancellor, he clung to the arm
and cried: "Girolamo, I have been watching him, he believes in his family already here!. Close
off! Today! Otherwise I dethroned this devil! "

Only the helpless boy in the arms of his chancellor, as an aged eunuch back before he turned and
solemnly pronounced the words: "The board of the authority are covered." The two followed him,
who progressed with an air of importance through a series of rooms. One of these, a cabinet,
which was not of its own output seemed, with its moss-green velvet wallpaper by and four like-colored
stools, and for confidential messages from certain slip angle be. In its center was the Duke
are surprised, because the posterior wall of the otherwise empty
space filled now an image that he did not recognize as his own.

It was secretly come to the palace, gave him a surprise, the gift of the Marquis of Mantua,
how to read on the frame standing. The Duke took his Chancellor by the hand, and both Italians
approached with quiet steps and a quiet, reverent joy the powerful Painting on a white marble
table playing chess, a man and a woman in life-size. This is an airy and warm creature in royal
robes, touched with hesitant fingers The Queen and researched both furtive glance in the face
of the opponent, of a Warriors of serious and worked trains in the
heavily drooping mouth a smile hidden.

Both Herzog and Chancellor recognized him immediately. It was Pescara. The woman guessed with ease.
Whoever it was, if not Victoria Colonna, the wife of Pescara and the Pearl Italy? They could
not be separated from the picture. They felt that his greatest charm The high and tender love
is that the soft lines of the poet and the hard of Commander in a warm living merged, and
no less the youth of the two, because even the benarbte and tanned Pescara appeared as a heroic
young man.

In fact, both eighteen, they were each approached the altar, and they had himself body and
soul loyalty kept separate and often long, with the chaste light
in Italy's great poet deepens his brooding in front of a smoldering
campfire on a map then finally back on Ischia, the possession of the
Marquis, as on a blissful island uniting.

Knew that such immoral and Italy did not doubt, but admired with a smile.

Also, the two standing before the picture felt the beauty of federal female Enthusiasm of the male
self-control. It felt not to the soul, But with the fine art of finger tips feeling. They would
have been a long time, if had not warned Chamberlain of subjection that two charged in the antechamber
of the dining room waited.

Through a few doors that was reached and, after a brief presentation
of the Guests enter this.

Now the four were sitting on the non-overloaded, but selected panel. During the first light conversation,
looked at the Duke secretly his guests. No faces were dissimilar be dreie than this. The ugly head,
and the grotesque features of his chancellor did indeed it by heart, but he noticed how restless
of today rolled his eyes and fiery as to the end of the three most jet-black curly hair seemed to bristle.
In addition, raised Guicciardini, the main building by male and a
Republican-proud expression from very noble.

The Venetian was finally soft image of a beautiful man with a full Hair, gently mocking eyes
and a charming treacherous smile. Also in the Color distinction between the three faces. The olive-brown
was the chancellor, the Venetians had the clear pallor of the lagoon, residents, and Guicciardin looked
so yellow and bilious out that the Duke felt about his health led
him to ask.

"Your Highness, I was suffering from jaundice," the Florentine replied
briefly.

"The bile has left me, and that's not very surprising, when you know
that I am in the sanctity of their legations has sent to set up the
same to a normal state.

Since creating an order where the priests are masters!

No more of this, otherwise the fever grips me, despite the healthy Air of Milan and the German good
news.

"He dismissed a sweet dish and prepared with more vinegar than oil a cucumber salad.

"News from Germany?" asked the Chancellor.

"Well, moron. I have letters from a practiced hand. The murder of
farmers are driven into pairs and - the best - Fra Martino even with
written and spoken encountered violence against them. This pleases
me and makes me believe in his mission. For, gentlemen, a world moving
Man has two offices: he takes what time the calls, but - and this
is its heavier Official - he stands like a giant hurls against the
splashing spray of the century and behind the excited fools and bad
guys who want mitthun that work just exaggerating and shameful. "

The
Duke was a little disappointed, because he loved war and turmoil,
if it beyond the Mountains raged and employed his imagination as he
himself was out of danger. The chancellor, however, took a sigh and
said with a true human feelings: "In Germania may now happen much
cruelty. "

"I am sorry," replied the Florentines, "but I keep that
picture in mind. Now, after Taming of the Knights and the stubborn
rebellious peasants lead, the princes. The Reformation or how would
ye call it, is saved. "

"And you are a Republican?" quipped the Chancellor.

Not
in Germany. "

Even the beautiful Laelius allowed himself a joke.
"And you serve the Holy Father, Guicciardin?" he whispered.

This,
the resistance, the sweet smile and his jaundice was irritable answered
frankly: "Yes, glory to the punishment for my sins, the Pope is a
Medici, and! this house has fallen Florence. But I will not be expelled
from my native town, volatile because his is the worst draw and lie
to his home to the largest field Crime.  In
large meetings the secretary takes his seat near the chairman:  he should in all cases keep
a record of the proceedings as described in § 51.

(b) Adoption of Resolutions.  These two officers are all that are usually necessary for a meeting;
so, when the secretary is elected, the chairman asks, "What is the further pleasure of the
meeting?"  If the meeting is merely a public assembly called together to consider some special
subject, it is customary at this stage of the proceedings for some one to offer a series of
resolutions previously prepared, or else to move the appointment of a committee to prepare
resolutions upon the subject.  In the first case he rises and says, "Mr.  Chairman;" the chairman
responds, "Mr. C."  Mr. C., having thus obtained the floor, then says, "I move the adoption
of the following resolutions," which he then reads and hands to the chairman;* [The practice
in legislative bodies, is to send to the clerk's desk all resolutions, bills, etc., the title
of the bill and the name of the member introducing it, being endorsed on each.  In such bodies,
however, there are several clerks and only one chairman.  In many assemblies there is but one
clerk or secretary, and, as he has to keep the minutes, there is no reason for his being constantly
interrupted to read every resolution offered. In such assemblies, without there is a rule or
established custom to the contrary, it is allowable, and frequently much better, to hand all
resolutions, reports, etc., directly to the chairman.  If they were read by the member introducing
them, and no one calls for another reading, the chairman can omit reading them when be thinks
they are fully understood.  In reference to the manner of reading and stating the question,
when the resolution contains several paragraphs, see Rules of Order, § 44.]

=== Page 102 ===========================================================

some one else says, "I second the motion."  The chairman sometimes directs the secretary to
read the resolutions again, after which he says, "The question is on the adoption of the resolutions
just read," and if no one rises immediately, he adds, "Are you ready for the question?"  If
no one then rises, he says, "As many as are in favor of the adoption of the resolutions just
read, will say aye;" after the ayes have voted, he says, "As many as are of a contrary opinion
will say no;" he then announces the result of the vote as follows:  "The motion is carried--the
resolutions are adopted," or, "The ayes have it--the resolutions are adopted."

(c) Committee to draft Resolutions.  If it is preferred to appoint a committee to draft resolutions,
a member, after he has addressed the Chair and been recognized, says, "I move that a committee
be appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of this meeting on,"

=== Page 103 ===========================================================

etc., adding the subject for which the meeting was called.  This motion being seconded, the
Chairman states the question [§ 67] and asks, "Are you ready for the question?"  If no one
rises, he puts the question, announces the result, and, if it is carried, he asks, "Of how
many shall the committee consist?"  If only one number is suggested, he announces that the
committee will consist of that number; if several numbers are suggested, he states the different
ones and then takes a vote on each, beginning with the largest, until one number is selected.

He then inquires, "How shall the committee be appointed?"  This is usually decided without
the formality of a vote.  The committee may be "appointed" by the Chair--in which case the
chairman names the committee and no vote is taken; or the committee may be "nominated" by the
Chair, or the members of the assembly (no member naming more than one, except by unanimous
consent), and then the assembly vote on their appointment.  When the chairman nominates, after
stating the names he puts one question on the entire committee, thus:  "As many as are in favor
of these gentlemen constituting the committee, will say

=== Page 104 ===========================================================

aye."  If nominations are made by members of the assembly, and more names mentioned than the
number of the committee, a separate vote should be taken on each name.  (In a mass meeting
it is safer to have all committees appointed by the chairman.)

When the committee are appointed they should at once retire and agree upon a report, which
should be written out as described in § 53.  During their absence other business may be attended
to, or the time may be occupied with hearing addresses.  Upon their return the chairman of
the committee (who is the one first named on the committee, and who quite commonly, though
not necessarily, is the one who made the motion to appoint the committee), avails himself of
the first opportunity to obtain the floor,* [See Rules of Order, § 2.] when he says, "The committee
appointed to draft resolutions, are prepared to report."  The chairman tells him that the assembly
will now hear the report, which is then read by the chairman of the committee, and handed to
the presiding officer, upon which the committee is dissolved without any action of the assembly.
If it is not desired to immediately adopt the resolutions, they can be debated, modified, their
consideration postponed, etc., as explained in §§ 55-63.

When through with the business for which the assembly were convened, or when from any other
cause it is desirable to close the meeting, some one moves "to adjourn;" if the motion is carried
and no other time for meeting has been appointed, the chairman says, "The motion is carried;
--this assembly stands adjourned without day."  [Another method by which the meeting may be
conducted is shown in § 48.]

(d) Additional Officers.  If more officers are

=== Page 106 ===========================================================

required than a chairman and secretary, they can be appointed before introducing the resolutions,
in the manner described for those officers; or the assembly can first form a temporary organization
in the manner already described, only adding "pro tem." to the title of the officers, thus:
"chairman pro tem."  In this latter case, as soon as the secretary pro tem. is elected, a committee
is appointed to nominate the permanent officers, as in the case of a convention [§ 47].  Frequently
the presiding officer is called the President, and sometimes there is a large number of Vice
Presidents appointed for mere complimentary purposes.  The Vice Presidents in large formal
meetings, sit on the platform beside the President, and in his absence, or when he vacates
the chair, the first on the list that is present should take the chair.

47. Meeting of a Convention or Assembly of Delegates.  If the members of the assembly have
been elected or appointed as members, it becomes necessary to know who are properly members
of the assembly and entitled to vote, before the permanent organization is effected.  In this
case a temporary organization is made, as already described, by the election of a chairman

=== Page 107 ===========================================================

and secretary "pro tem.," when the chairman announces, "The next business in order is the appointment
of a committee on credentials."  A motion may then be made covering the entire case, thus:
"I move that a committee of three on the credentials of members be appointed by the Chair,
and that the committee report as soon as practicable;" or they may include only one of these
details, thus:  "I move that a committee be appointed on the credentials of members."  In either
case the Chair proceeds as already described in the cases of committees on resolutions [§ 46, (c)].

On the motion to accept the report of the committee, none can vote except those reported by
the committee as having proper credentials. The committee, beside reporting a list of members
with proper credentials, may report doubtful or contested cases, with recommendations, which
the assembly may adopt, or reject, or postpone, etc.  Only members whose right to their seats
is undisputed, can vote.

The chairman, after the question of credentials is disposed of, at least for the time, announces
that "The next business in order is the election of permanent officers of the assembly."  Some
one then moves the appointment of a

=== Page 108 ===========================================================

committee to nominate the officers, in a form similar to this:  "I move that a committee of
three be appointed by the Chair to nominate the permanent officers of this convention."  This
motion is treated as already explained.  When the committee make their report, some one moves
"That the report of the committee be accepted and that the officers nominated be declared the
officers of this convention."* [Where there is any competition for the offices, it is better
that they be elected by ballot.  In this case, when the nominating committee report, a motion
can be made as follows:  "I move that the convention now proceed to ballot for its permanent
officers;" or "I move that we now proceed to the election, by ballot, of the permanent officers
of this convention." [See Rules of Order, § 38, for balloting, and other methods of voting.]
The constitutions of permanent societies usually provide that the officers shall be elected
by ballot.] This motion being carried, the chairman declares the officers elected, and instantly
calls the new presiding officer to the chair, and the temporary secretary is at the same time
replaced.  The convention is now organized for work.

48. A Permanent Society.  (a) First Meeting.  When it is desired to form a permanent society,
those interested in it should see that only the proper persons are invited to be present, at
a certain time and place. [§ 46, (a)]; and, as in that case, when the chairman is elected,
he announces as the first business in order the election of a secretary.

After the secretary is elected, the chairman calls on some member who is most interested in
getting up the society, to state the object of the meeting.  When this member rises he says,
"Mr. Chairman;" the chairman then announces his name, when the member proceeds to state the
object of the meeting. The Duke nodded gloomily. "No," cried the Chancellor,
"they do not, gives the authority to withdraw, they can not justify it, to exhaust the last
resources of the Duchy! It attracts not discouraged the field, in advance and beaten! The league is
canceled! Or let her look for a victorious general. "

The two others were silent discontented.

"And I know one!" Morone said.

"You know him?" shouted Guicciardini. "With all the devils out with it! Speech! Who we throw into
the scale against Pescara?

"Speak, Chancellor!" also drove the Venetians.

Morone, who had jumped from his stool, entered a step forward and spoke to loud voice: "Who we
throw into the scale against Pescara Pescara on an equal footing, it myself! "

A horror petrified society. The Duke stared his outstanding Chancellor with open eyes, while
Guicciardini Venetian and the slow hand to his Forehead and began
to meditate.

They both guessed as smart people with no difficulty Morone as it said. They were the sons of a
century, where every kind of treachery and Breach of faith to the everyday things belonged.
If it was an ordinary condottiere traded, one of those princely or plebeian adventurers who their
bands to the highest bidder sold, they probably would have anticipated the Registrar be impious
word from his lips. But the first imperial army leader? But Pescara? Impossible! But why not Pescara?
And there began to speak passionately Morone, she swallowed his words.

"Gentlemen,"

he said, "Pescara is born among us. He has never entered Spain. The glorious Italian is his wife.
He must love Italy. It belongs to us, and in this fateful hour, as we have with our other free arm
unmarried already bound do we take the greatest son of the homeland and its only commander to
complete. We want to go to him, embrace him and call him: "Save Italy, Pescara! Pull it up! Or
is it pulls you into the abyss! "

"Enough recited!" Guicciardini called. "A visionary like you, Chancellor, with the irrepressible
jumps your imagination is there to think up the impossible to pronounce and, perhaps, A closer look,
not completely impossible. Now, however, was silent and let the sane inspect it and to fabricate
what you have prophesied in fever. Do not gesture as a madman, but sit down and let me talk!

Rulers,
often in desperate situations and always boldness is the best and only advice. The war in
the Urbino stares at us like a mask with blank eyes. We all feel it would paralyze us slowly
and methodically to ruin. Better to be a neck-breaking venture. So yes! When it comes to me,
we try to Pescara! He betrayed us to the Emperor, it may destroy us all. But who knows if he loses
his demon? First we must ask ourselves: Who is Pescara? I will tell you: a brilliant machine
that the opportunities separates sharp and weighs, the things under their deceptive has to face
their true value and its real power to investigate the habit. Would he otherwise, he is the
winner of Bicocca and Pavia? If we take him, he is first a great pretend indignation over
a case, he certainly has in itself some Hours, is "considered to have, though perhaps only
as an exercise of its constantly working mind.

Then he will weigh up slowly and carefully: the material that we
consider it , Enter the name of our Italy, whether it could form an
army and later a kingdom and - his reward.

And because the product is indeed noble, but brittle and a huge fine Hand requires, we must offer
him the greatest reward: a crown. "

"What crown?" stammered the Duke anxiously.

"A crown, sovereign, I said, no Duke hat, and said the beautiful Naples. It is in enemy hands, that
is done, and a feud of holiness. "

"If we dispensation crowns," mocked the Venetians, "why we do not offer the Pescara equal to
the fable and dream crown of Italy? "

"The dream crown!" The face of the Florentine shrugged painfully. Then he said defiantly, and
forgetting the people sitting around: "The Crown of Italy Pescara, if at the top of ours! Army
rides, it is anonymous herschweben before him. Does he want her as the greatest of our History,
and take hold, this ideal crown, after which for so many hands and
The wicked have laid the most!

May she be on his head to the truth!

And, "he said boldly," because we leave any ordinary measure, and our Endgedanken give shape and innermost
desires, know, gentlemen: Pescara is the predicted target as it would be possible in the time
benefits are great and happy in the stars Promises. Italy is building it, he will master it. But,
Chancellor, I have you called a dreamer and fantasize larger than you Returning from the realm
of Unborn in the reality and we ask the question: who will take over the role of the tempter
"

"I throw myself as Curtius into the abyss!" cried the Chancellor.

"Law", approved Guicciardini. "You're the person to do so. One else would refuse to vote, and
he would drown in shame if he were to come to Pescara to him by his treachery talk. You are shameless
but are capable of anything, and your fool's cap brings you out of situations and complications,
where everyone would hang others. Will not Pescara, he takes you from your crazy side and treats
you as a buffoon, he wants to, he is under your tragic comic gestures and your wrinkles the seriousness
and the size of the thing too knowledge discovery. Go thou, my son and try the Pescara! "

The
duke, who had huddled brooding on his stool wanted, just after light call, since the dawn rose,
and he feared the dark. As he saw things unexpectedly come on its top and was afraid. "Chancellor,
you must not!" forbade it. "I want to do with this big powerful Pescara
have nothing.

Do we get him, he is first take my levels, which attract the war, and my fortress, which they
claim. And he has, he will keep them. He gambled that, I will atone for first and fall into
Drums of the saying of the emperor, my liege lord. Oh, I see through you! You all, This even
there "- he looked sadly after his Chancellor -" Only your habet Italy in the sense that applies
to you and I "- he blew across the palm of his hand -" so much!

But I am a prince and want my heritage, my Milan, and nothing but
my Milan!

And you, do not go Girolamo, to Pescara. The business would suffer. I can do without you an
hour! "

Now the beautiful Laelius took the floor and whispered: "If it would
be sovereignty, it would their objection to our plan fell through,
and I would have another.

As we once look strangely enough, after our Captain in the Imperial commander would not about
the experiment for whether the Borbone, against a great offer, to a second Entschlösse treason?
"

The Duke gave a start. "When you travel, my Girolamo? he asked.

"First, Chancellor," interrupted Guicciardini, "I have orders to take you to Rome. The Holy Father
wants to meet you in detail. Because he has a great opinion of you. He calls up the Registrar
Proteus, claiming that you were, in spite of your great eye, a of the smartest men in Italy.
"

"This is good," said the Venetian, "has shifted because it is the decisive hour, occurs in what
Girolamo Morone as attempts to Pescara. I wish that hour ago to give a reason and a root in
public opinion. May I distribute about Gentlemen? "

The bland face of Venice, took in so far as the twilight was still differ, an energetic expression,
and he talked with pithy voice: "The Chancellor, as he his major Word uttered, has shocked us, no
doubt, but not really set in amazement. After the devastating impact of Pavia, Italy, the emperor all
our helpless feet had dropped, public opinion, sought by itself a barrier against the threat
Omnipotence and let out the nature of things our league grow up.

At the same time focused public opinion with the reward of Pescara for his complete victory
and the capture of a king due. And since the sparse and the ingratitude of the Emperor are world
famous, moved they concluded that he does not satisfy his general
and this one elsewhere will look for replacements.

Now connects the public opinion, these two things: our already by shining patriotic collar and a
greater potential profit of Pescara. Thus, be crossing credible, before it takes place. Only it
is expedient that this justified general view by a skilled hand a compelling figure and a
common Tongue an understandable language for the whole of Italy would be given. Now recently
a wandering Talent among us turned up a promising young man, who hopefully Bound to Venice
can be - "

"A kick to the Arezzo! He has slandered me shameful ..." "A divine man! He called me the first princes
of Italy, "cried Guicciardini and the Duke together from.

"I see," smiled Nasi, "the man is also known for its value. His letters, spread of real or imaginary
persons, in thousands and thousands of leaves, are a power and rule the world. I will send him a
very strong amount, and you will wonder about the seeds of beautiful
colored toadstools, the overnight from all over the floor Italian
shoots up: Verse, papers, correspondence, a bacchanalian popups, tumbling
and dance naked veiled, threatening and alluring characters and phrases,
all around Pescara turning and the probability and beauty of his treachery.

It forms an invincible general belief that rips across the Pescara us and it also - as it is
- at the imperial court undermines so thoroughly and finally, that it must be a traitor, he
wanted to or not. "

"No way, Sir!" cried the Chancellor of the darkness. "You ruined me the game! The Liberator
of Italy is to decide in full freedom, not as the victim of a diabolical
Ensnarement ... "

"You're gorgeous, Chancellor, moral with your scruples!" interrupted Guicciardini. "Know, my heart
is outraged and takes part for the hopelessly outwitted! But I hot silent man, and act as a statesman.
The means of excellence without Comparison among all the things this evening found the most
ruthless, but also the Wisest and most effective.

Only now the thing is truly dangerous for Pescara, and his Probably
treason.

To work. "

"He is with us and listen!" cried the Duke in a shrill voice that drove all together. Their eyes
followed his frightened. The moon, as the dazzling silver disc over the Horizon was kicked and
its slanting rays began to throw in the little room, played strange on the game of chess. Victoria
produced swelling eyes looked angry, as were speaking it: Have you heard Pescara? What wickedness!
and now anxiously asked: What will you do, Pescara? He was pale as death, with a smile on their
faces.

Chapter Two

In light of the wide bay window that noble Vatican chamber, at the floorboards and walls Raphael
glorifies the triumphs of the human spirit, an old man sat with broad strokes and venerable
appearance. He spoke slowly to the turned-up, with dark blond braids entwined head of a woman
who was sitting at his feet and with a warm human blood in the veins was as beautiful as the concepts
of law and theology, as the Urbinate embodied in beautiful female figures. The aged pope,
with his long stooping Back and in his flowing white robe resembled a wise matron who didactic
chatting with a young woman.

Not even long did Victoria have been sitting on her stool, because the Holy Father asked just
now about the health of her husband, the Marquis of Pescara. "The side wound of Pavia does not
adopt more sensible? "he said.

"The marquis is completely healed," Victoria replied innocently. "The side wound is healed, as well as
the more serious cut on his forehead. He will welcome Your Holiness, when the holiday takes
up that has been promised him the grace of the Emperor and us happy
man "- she said with exultant eyes -. unite "our sea island, but he
himself refuses same for one more time, less of the political horizon
because of, not the brighter still was more turbid than usual - he
writes - but because he just now reluctant to leave the army.

The murderer, "she said with a smile," deals with that is a perfected firearm and a new maneuver.
He only could now bring to a conclusion. He has me He initially wanted to surprise here in
Rome, summoned to his camp to Novara and I leave tomorrow, not in the shell of my litter,
but in my semi-heated Turkish horses. If I had wings! I long for the scars of my Lord, whose I face
not seen since that famous battle, which has made him immortal. And so I rushed to the holiness
in the joy of my heart for me to leave of her: because that is the purpose of my visit. "Thus
spake Victoria welling and swelling as a Roman fountain.

Your sincere words taught the Holy Father to let his actions and Pescara in the same Shady
place, which he loved.

The only difference that the young Pescara at the crucial moments like a lightning sprang from
his cloud, while Clemens indecisive, angry at himself, hidden in
his, stayed because he senile wisdom to take over the moment failed.

He sharpened, spoken in another picture, the pen until his anger broke the all-too fine point.
Now he was silent and sampled.

"A holiday has requested the Marquis?" he wondered. "I think, in his resignation? Achilles is angry
in the tent, so I heard. "

"I know nothing, and I do not think the Holy Father," said Victoria tossed with a proud gesture
of his head. "Why resign?"

"Not because of a rosy Briseis, Madonna," Clemens responded angrily with a frosty Jokes, "but
cheated out of a captured king and the towers of Sora and Carpi."

Thus the pope played on two known facts. The viceroy of Naples had at Pavia, Pescara accommodating,
the sword of the French king and therefore received the honor anticipated to be allowed to carry the
illustrious prey to Spain. And then the emperor had Sora and the Carpi greedy columns, their
own relatives of Victoria paid, not his great general, who also had a look for it.

Victoria blushed angrily. "Holy Father, do you think little of my husband. Your Stellet Imagine
a petty Pescara: my prayer on vacation, so I go and convince me that your not my Pescara Pescara.
I am in a hurry to come before the true one. "
She rose and stood tall against the pope, but already she bowed again
deeply humble gesture to imploring his blessing. Then he asked her
to sit down again, and they obeyed. Clemens could not let the opportunity
escape, Pescara by the beloved Mouth to persuade his wife to drop
out. But that with allusions and preparations for Colonna, as he saw
it before, nothing would be done, he easily understood: either would
they rebel against the ambiguous or as something incomprehensible
and unseen term throw into the corner. He had this real and urgent
nature of truth in the matter clear outline drawing and put in a full
light, so they have the same of her look worthy. It went against his
nature, and he drew a heavy sigh.

He found some information that
was not without wit and cunning. He said Victoria with an innocent
look, while the hand with the fisherman's ring on a bound in blue
velvet Book with gilded palaces reflected: "Are you crazy something
poetic, beloved daughter? Truly, I an admirer of your muse, I am because
it deals with the good and holy.

If the proceedings are to be published, the secretary should always examine the published proceedings
of similar meetings, so as to conform to the custom, excepting where it is manifestly improper.

The Constitution, By-Laws, Rules of Order and Standing Rules should all be written in one book,
leaving every other page blank; and whenever an amendment is made to any of them, it should
be immediately entered on the page opposite to the article amended, with a reference to the
date and page of the minutes where is recorded the action of the society.

The secretary has the custody of all papers belonging to the society, not specially under charge
of any other officer.  Sometimes his

=== Page 123 ===========================================================

duties are also of a financial kind, when he should make such reports as are prescribed in
the next section.

52. Treasurer.  The duties of this officer vary in different societies. In probably the majority
of cases he acts as a banker, merely holding the funds deposited with him, and paying them
out on the order of the society signed by the secretary.  His annual report, which is always
required, in this case consists of merely a statement of the amount on hand at the commencement
of the year, the amount received during the year (stating from what source received), the total
amount paid out by order of the society, and the balance on hand.  When this report is presented
it is referred to an "auditing committee," consisting of one or two persons, who examine the
treasurer's books and vouchers, and certify on his report that they "have examined his accounts
and vouchers and find them correct, and the balance on hand is," etc., stating the amount on
hand.  The auditing committee's report being accepted is equivalent to a resolution of the
society to the same effect, namely, that the treasurer's report is correct.

In the case here supposed, the real financial

=== Page 124 ===========================================================

statement is made either by the board of trustees, or by the secretary or some other officer,
according to the Constitution of the society. The principles involved, are, that every officer
who receives money is to account for it in a report to the society, and that whatever officer
is responsible for the disbursements, shall report them to the society. If the secretary, as
in many societies, is really responsible for the expenses, the treasurer merely paying upon
his order, then the secretary should make a full report of these expenses, so classified as
to enable the society to readily see the amounts expended for various purposes.

It should always be remembered that the financial report is made for the information of members.
The details of dates and separate payments for the same object, are a hinderance to its being
understood, and are useless, as it is the duty of the auditing committee to examine into the
details and see if the report is correct.

Every disbursing officer should be careful to get a receipt whenever he makes a payment; these
receipts should be preserved in regular order, as they are the vouchers for the payments, which
must be examined by the auditing committee.  Disbursing officers cannot be

=== Page 125 ===========================================================

too careful in keeping their accounts, and they should insist upon having their accounts audited
every time they make a report, as by this means any error is quickly detected and may be corrected.
When the society has accepted the auditing committee's report that the financial report is
correct, the disbursing officer is relieved from the responsibility of the past, and if his
vouchers were lost afterwards, it would cause no trouble.  The best form for these financial
reports depends upon the kind of society, and is best determined by examining those made in
similar societies.

The following form can be varied to suit most cases:  (when the statement of receipts and expenses
is very long, it is often desirable to specify the amounts received from one or two particular
sources, which can be done immediately after stating the total receipts; the same course can
be taken in regard to the expenditures):

Treasurer's Report.

The undersigned, Treasurer of the M. L. Society, begs leave to submit the following annual report:

The balance on hand at the commencement of the year was --- dollars and --- cents.  There was
received from all sources during the year, --- dollars and --- cents; during the same time the

=== Page 126 ===========================================================

expenses amounted to --- dollars and --- cents, leaving a balance on hand of --- dollars and
--- cents.  The annexed statement of receipts and expenditures will show in detail the sources
from which the receipts were obtained, and the objects to which the expenditures have been
applied.  All of which is respectfully submitted.

S-- M--, Treasurer M. L. S.

The "Statement of receipts and expenditures" can be made, by simply giving a list of receipts,
followed by a list of expenses, and finishing up with the balance on hand.  The auditing committee's
certificate to the correctness of the account should be written on the statement. Often the
statement is made out in the form of an account, as follows:

Dr.          The M. L. S. in acct. with S. M., Treas.              Cr. -----------------------------------------------------------------------

We do hereby certify that we have examined the accounts and vouchers of the treasurer, and
find them correct; and that the balance in his hands is twenty-four dollars and sixty-three
cents.  R. V., J. L., Audit Comm.

53. Committees.  In small assemblies, especially in those where but little business is done,
there is not much need of committees.  But in large assemblies, or in those doing a great deal
of business, committees are of the utmost importance.  When a committee is properly selected,
in nine cases out of ten its action decides that of the assembly.  A committee for action should
be small and consist only of those heartily in favor of the proposed action.  A committee for
deliberation or investigation, on the contrary, should be larger and represent all parties
in the assembly, so that its opinion will carry with it as great weight as possible.  The usefulness
of the committee will be greatly impaired, if any important faction of the assembly be unrepresented
on the committee.  The appointment of a committee is fully explained in § 46 (c).

The first member named on a committee is their chairman, and it is his duty to call together
the committee, and preside at their meetings.  If he is absent, or from any cause fails or
declines to call a meeting, it is the duty of the committee to assemble on the call of any
two of their members.  The committee are a miniature assembly, only being able to act when

=== Page 128 ===========================================================

a quorum is present.  If a paper is referred to them they must not deface it in any way, but
write their amendments on a separate sheet. If they originate the paper, all amendments must
be incorporated in it. When they originate the paper, usually one member has previously prepared
a draft, which is read entirely through, and then read by paragraphs, the chairman pausing
after each paragraph and asking, "Are there any amendments proposed to this paragraph?"  No
vote is taken on the adoption of the separate paragraphs, but after the whole paper has been
read in this way, it is open to amendment, generally, by striking out any paragraph or inserting
new ones, or by substituting an entirely new paper for it.  When it has been amended to suit
the committee, they should adopt it as their report, and direct the chairman or some other
member to report it to the assembly.  It is then written out, usually commencing in a style
similar to this:  "The committee to which was referred [state the matter referred], beg leave
to submit the following report;" or, "Your committee appointed to [specify the object], would
respectfully report," etc.  It usually closes thus:  "All of which is respectfully submitted,"
followed by the signatures of

=== Page 129 ===========================================================

all the members concurring in the report, or sometimes by only that of the chairman.

If the minority submit a report, it commences thus:  "The undersigned, a minority of the committee
appointed," etc., continuing as the regular report of the committee.  After the committee's
report has been read, it is usual to allow the minority to present their report, but it cannot
be acted upon except by a motion to substitute it for the report of the committee.  When the
committee's report is read, they are discharged without any motion.  A motion to refer the
paper back to the same committee (or to re-commit), if adopted, revives the committee.

Art. XI.  Introduction of Business.

54. Any member wishing to bring business before the assembly, should, without it is very simple,
write down in the form of a motion, what he would like to have the assembly adopt, thus:

Resolved, That the thanks of this convention be tendered to the citizens of this community
for their hearty welcome and generous hospitality.

=== Page 130 ===========================================================

When there is no other business before the assembly, he rises and addresses the chairman by
his title, thus:  "Mr. Chairman," who immediately recognizes him by announcing his name.* [If
the chairman has any special title, as President, for instance, he should be addressed by it,
thus:  "Mr. President."  Sometimes the chairman recognizes the speaker by merely bowing to
him, but the proper course is to announce his name.] He, then having the floor, says that he
"moves the adoption of the following resolution," which he reads and hands to the chairman.**
[Or, when he is recognized by the chair, he may say that he wishes to offer the following resolutions,
which he reads and then moves their adoption.] Some one else seconds the motion, and the chairman
says, "It has been moved and seconded that the following resolution be adopted," when he reads
the resolution; or he may read the resolution and then state the question thus:  "The question
is on the adoption of the resolution just read."  The merits of the resolution are then open
to discussion, but before any member can discuss the question or make any motion, he must first
obtain the floor as just described.  After the chairman states the question, if no one rises
to speak, or when he thinks the debate closed, he asks, "Are you ready for the question?" 
If no one then rises, he puts the question in a form similar to the following:  "The question
is on the adoption of the resolution

=== Page 131 ===========================================================

which you have heard; as many as are in favor of its adoption will say aye."  When the ayes
have voted, he says, "As many as are of a contrary opinion will say no."* [There are many other
ways of putting a question; see § 67, and Rules of Order, § 38.  A majority of the votes cast
is sufficient for the adoption of any motion, excepting those mentioned in § 68.

Art. XII.  Motions.

55. Motions Classified According to their Object.  Instead of immediately adopting or rejecting
a resolution as originally submitted, it may be desirable to dispose of it in some other way,
and for this purpose various motions have come into use, which can be made while a resolution
is being considered, and for the time being, supersede it. No one can make any of these motions
while another member has the floor,

=== Page 132 ===========================================================

excepting as shown in § 64, which see for the circumstances under which each motion can be made.

The following list comprises most of these motions, arranged in eight classes, according to
the object for which each motion is used.  [The names of the motions are printed in Italics;

56. To Amend or Modify.  (a) Amend.  Sometimes the enemies of a measure seek to amend it in
such a way as to divide its friends, and thus defeat it.

When the amendment has been moved and seconded, the chairman should always state the question
distinctly, so that every one may know exactly what is before them, reading first the paragraph
which it is proposed to amend; then the words to be struck out, if there are any; next, the
words to be inserted, if any; and finally, the paragraph as it will stand if the

=== Page 134 ===========================================================

amendment is adopted.  He then states that the question is on the adoption of the amendment,
which is open to debate, the remarks being confined to the merits of the amendment, only going
into the main question so far as is necessary in order to ascertain the propriety of adopting
the amendment.

This amendment can be amended, but an "amendment of an amendment" cannot be amended.  None
of the undebatable motions mentioned in § 66, except to fix the time to which to adjourn, can
be amended, nor can the motion to postpone indefinitely.

(b) Commit.  If the original question is not well digested, or needs more amendment than can
well be made in the assembly, it is usual to move "to refer it to a committee."  This motion
can be made while an amendment is pending, and it opens the whole merits of the question to
debate.  This motion can be amended by specifying the number of the committee, or how they
shall be appointed, or when they shall report, or by giving them any other instructions.  [See
§ 53 on committees, and § 46 (c) on their appointment.]

57. To Defer Action.  (a) Postpone to a certain time.  If it is desired to defer action

=== Page 135 ===========================================================

upon a question till a particular time, the proper motion to make, is to "postpone it to that
time."  This motion allows of but limited debate, which must be confined to the propriety of
the postponement to that time; it can be amended by altering the time, and this amendment allows
of the same debate.  The time specified must not be beyond that session [§ 70] of the assembly,
except it be the next session, in which case it comes up with the unfinished business at the
next session.  This motion can be made when a motion to amend, or to commit or to postpone
indefinitely, is pending.

(b) Lie on the table.  Instead of postponing a question to a particular time, it may be desired
to lay it aside temporarily until some other question is disposed of, retaining the privilege
of resuming its consideration at any time.* [In Congress this motion is commonly used to defeat
a measure, though it does not prevent a majority from taking it at any other time.  Some societies
prohibit a question from being taken from the table, except by a two-thirds vote.  This rule
deprives the society of the advantages of the motion to "lie on the table." because it would
not be safe to lay a question aside temporarily, if one-third of the assembly were opposed
to the measure, as that one-third could prevent its ever being taken from the table.  A bare
majority should not have the power, in ordinary societies, to adopt or reject a question, or
prevent its consideration, without debate.  [See note at end of § 35, Rules of Order, on the
principles involved in making questions undebatable.] The only way to accomplish this, is to
move that the question "lie on the table."  This motion

=== Page 136 ===========================================================

allowing of neither debate nor amendment, the chairman immediately puts the question; if carried,
the whole matter is laid aside until the assembly vote to "take it from the table" (which latter
motion is undebatable and possesses no privilege).  Sometimes this motion is used to suppress
a measure, as shown in § 59 (c).

58. To Suppress Debate.  (a) Previous Question.  While as a general rule free debate is allowed
upon every motion,* [Except an "objection to the consideration of the question" [§ 59 (a)].
See note to § 35, Rules of Order, for a full discussion of this subject of debate.] which,
if adopted, has the effect of adopting the original question or removing it from before the
assembly for the session,--yet, to prevent a minority from making an improper use of this privilege,
it is necessary to have methods by which debate can be closed, and final action at once be
taken upon a question.

To accomplish this, when any debatable question is before the assembly, it is only necessary
for some one to obtain the floor and "call for the previous question;" this call being seconded,
the chairman, as it allows of no debate, instantly puts the question, thus:  "Shall the main
question be now put?"  If this is carried by a two-thirds vote [§ 68], all debate instantly

=== Page 137 ===========================================================

ceases, excepting that the member who offered the original resolution, or reported it from
a committee, is, as in all other cases, entitled to the floor to close the debate; after which,
the chairman immediately puts the questions to the assembly, first, on the motion to commit,
if it is pending; if this is carried, of course the subject goes to the committee; if, however,
it fails, the vote is next taken on amendments, and finally on the resolution as amended.

If a motion to postpone, either definitely or indefinitely, or a motion to reconsider, or an
appeal is pending, the previous question is exhausted by the vote on the postponement, reconsideration
or appeal, and does not cut off debate upon any other motions that may be pending. If the call
for the previous question fails, that is, the debate is not cut off, the debate continues the
same as if this motion had not been made.  The previous question can be called for simply on
an amendment, and after the amendment has been acted upon, the main question is again open
to debate.

(b) An order limiting or closing debate.  Sometimes, instead of cutting off debate entirely
by ordering the previous question, it is desirable to allow of but very limited debate.  In

=== Page 138 ===========================================================

this case, a motion is made to limit the time allowed each speaker or the number of speeches
on each side, or to appoint a time at which debate shall close and the question be put.  The
motion may be made to limit debate on an amendment, in which case the main question would afterwards
be open to debate and amendment; or it may be made simply on an amendment to an amendment.

In ordinary societies, where harmony is so important, a two-thirds vote should be required
for the adoption of any of the above motions to cut off or limit debate.* [In the House of
Representatives, these motions require only a majority vote for their adoption.  In the Senate,
to the contrary, not even two-thirds of the members can force a measure to its passage without
allowing debate, the Senate rules not recognizing the above motions.

59. To Suppress the Question.  (a) Objection to the consideration of a question.  Sometimes
a resolution is introduced that the assembly do not wish to consider at all, because it is
profitless, or irrelevant to the objects of the assembly, or for other reasons.  The proper
course to pursue in such case, is for some one, as soon as it is introduced, to "object to
the consideration of the question."  This objection not requiring a second, the chairman immediately

=== Page 139 ===========================================================

puts the question, "Will the assembly consider this question?"  If decided in the negative
by a two-thirds vote, the question is immediately dismissed, and cannot be again introduced
during that session.  This objection must be made when the question is first introduced, before
it has been debated, and it can be made when another member has the floor.

(b) Postpone indefinitely.  After the question has been debated, the proper motion to use in
order to suppress the question for the session, is to postpone indefinitely.  It cannot be
made while any motion except the original or main question is pending, but it can be made after
an amendment has been acted upon, and the main question, as amended, is before the assembly.
It opens the merits of the main question to debate to as great an extent as if the main question
were before the assembly. On account of these two facts, in assemblies with short sessions
it is not very useful, as the same result can usually be more easily attained by the next motion.

(c) Lie on the table.  If there is no possibility during the remainder of the session of obtaining
a majority vote for taking up the question, then the quickest way of suppressing it is

=== Page 140 ===========================================================

to move "that the question lie on the table;" which, allowing of no debate, enables the majority
to instantly lay the question on the table, from which it cannot be taken without their consent.

From its high rank [§ 64] and undebatable character, this motion is very commonly used to suppress
a question, but, as shown in § 57 (b), its effect is merely to lay the question aside till
the assembly choose to consider it, and it only suppresses the question so long as there is
a majority opposed to its consideration.

60. To Consider a question a second time.  Reconsider.  When a question has been once adopted,
rejected or suppressed, it cannot be again considered during that session [§ 70], except by
a motion to "reconsider the vote" on that question. Deadlines of me
Numa! Pull me out in the summer into autumn, until the first flakes! So much I need time to
complete my victory. And most of all, I said, keep my secret! No one know our secret! It would triple
the forces of the enemy and me and my army spoil. Once again, silence! I want it! I commanded
him ... And I was simulating life, so good that I gave Italy the bridal ring, "he smiled." And I will
once more on horseback ! Sit But you, Victoria vow to me - but no vow, you're doing it to please
me - not uncalled nachzueilen me my march through the cloud of dust and blood-soaked fields.
Also, would you people to mock the war, do not give up on, good and beautiful as you are; but
pampered on the general. So you stay. But where? Here?

Victoria remembered, hopeless suffering in the trains. Then she said: "Yesterday, as I rode, I was
already in the precincts of the city, at a small convent over. It is, I learned, holy wounds.
There I will wait your call, do penance and for your Recovery pray. "

"For my recovery?" he smiled. "Do this, but you will not get bored in the Holy Wounds; the monastery,
I heard it has beautiful voice and is famous for its choral singing. Ride we out soon, now that
it is fresh and the dust of the highway is not disturbed. " He was a light step through the
park over the old castle to make saddle.

Victoria followed with slow steps, and she saw the doctor Numa, who after the night of the generals
came to inquire, she went to him with painfully moving air: she wanted to accuse him that he
concealed from her reality, and yet it summon periods with the last resources and secrets of
his art the beloved life. But since Colonna saw the doctor come, he put his feelings in the
faint trembling Hands defensively against them from, with the prayer: Even me, I can do nothing!
She understood the gesture and went their way, past Ippolito, who bent the knee before her,
and she was not aware of, to the great grief of the boy.

In the palace courtyard she found the difficult and costly harnessed cents Pescara and its also saddled
fallow Berber. The general lifted her on his horse, and rode in greeting Drum roll on the lowering
drawbridge out into the unpredictable rice fields of Lombardy Level.

Them at a respectful distance followed by a groom of Pescara, one of southern Calabrian sun blackened,
and a mule, the Roman maid Victoria.

Behind the passengers echoed in the courtyard of the unheard cries of the forgotten Chancellor. He
was from bad dreams and wakes have been wrong in the morning through the gardens, always re getting
to walls and ramparts, here from Germany, where watched by Spanish guards. The Swabians heartily rejoiced
at his extravagant gestures, while the Spaniards consenting mischievous glances exchanged: they
did not doubt, the general had the Minister lured into the trap of the enemy, and promised
to him tomorrow when he dragged the army would be to torture to their heart's desire and thoroughly
plunder. At last he was in the roundabout been exhausted and fell on the same bench, where he last
the slumbering Pescara had found and overheard. Then he heard the
salute of the gate guard, ran to the courtyard and wanted nachstürzen
over the bridge. Of the items received with outstretched halberds,
He looked plaintively to the commander and Victoria vanish in the
haze of the distance.  When the time arrives, the chairman may
state that fact, and put the above question without waiting for a motion.  If the motion fails,
the call for the orders of the day cannot be renewed till the subject then before the assembly
is disposed of.* [In Congress, a member entitled to the floor cannot be interrupted by a call
for the orders of the day.  In an ordinary assembly, the most common case where orders of the
day are decided upon is where it is necessary to make a programme for the session.  When the
hour arrives for the consideration of any subject on the programme, these rules permit any
member to call for the orders of the day (as described in Rules of Order, § 2) even though
another person has the floor.  If this were not permitted, it would often be impossible to
carry out the programme, though wished for by the majority.  A majority could postpone the
orders of the day, when called for, so as to continue the discussion of the question then before
the assembly.  An order as to the time when any subject shall be considered, must not be confounded
with the rules of the assembly; the latter must be enforced by the chairman, without they are
suspended by a two-thirds vote; the former, in strictness, can only be carried out by the order
of a majority of the assembly then present and voting.]

(b) Special Order.  If a subject is of such importance that it is desired to consider it at
a special time in preference to the orders of the day and established order of business, then
a motion should be made to make the question a "special order" for that particular time.  This

=== Page 144 ===========================================================

motion requires a two-thirds vote for its adoption, because it is really a suspension of the
rules, and it is in order whenever a motion to suspend the rules is in order.  If a subject
is a special order for a particular day, then on that day it supersedes all business except
the reading of the minutes.  A special order can be postponed by a majority vote.  If two special
orders are made for the same day, the one first made takes precedence.

(c) Suspension of the Rules.  It is necessary for every assembly, if discussion is allowed,
to have rules to prevent its time being wasted, and to enable it to accomplish the object for
which the assembly was organized.  And yet at times their best interests are subserved by suspending
their rules temporarily.  In order to do this, some one makes a motion "to suspend the rules
that interfere with," etc., stating the object of the suspension.  If this motion is carried
by a two-thirds vote, then the particular thing for which the rules were suspended can be done.
By "general consent," that is, if no one objects, the rules can at any time be ignored without
the formality of a motion.

(d) Questions of Order.  It is the duty of the chairman to enforce the rules and preserve

=== Page 145 ===========================================================

order, and when any member notices a breach of order, he can call for the enforcement of the
rules.  In such cases, when he rises he usually says, "Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of order."
The chairman then directs the speaker to take his seat, and having heard the point of order,
decides the question and permits the first speaker to resume his speech, directing him to abstain
from any conduct that was decided to be out of order.  When a speaker has transgressed the
rules of decorum he cannot continue his speech, if any one objects, without permission is granted
him by a vote of the assembly.  Instead of the above method, when a member uses improper language,
some one says, "I call the gentleman to order;" when the chairman decides as before whether
the language is disorderly.

(e) Appeal.  While on all questions of order, and of interpretation of the rules and of priority
of business, it is the duty of the chairman to first decide the question, it is the privilege
of any member to "appeal from the decision."  If the appeal is seconded, the chairman states
his decision, and that it has been appealed from, and then states the question, thus:  "Shall
the decision of the chair stand as the judgment of the assembly?"  [or society, convention, etc.]

=== Page 146 ===========================================================

The chairman can then, without leaving the chair, state the reasons for his decision, after
which it is open to debate (no member speaking but once), excepting in the following cases,
when it is undebatable:  (1) When it relates to transgressions of the rules of speaking, or
to some indecorum, or to the priority of business; and (2) when the previous question was pending
at the time the question of order was raised. After the vote is taken, the chairman states
that the decision of the chair is sustained, or reversed, as the case may be.

62. Miscellaneous.  (a) Reading of papers and (b) Withdrawal of a motion.  If a speaker wishes
to read a paper, or a member to withdraw his motion after it has been stated by the chair,
it is necessary, if any one objects, to make a motion to grant the permission.

(c) Questions of Privilege.  Should any disturbance occur during the meeting, or anything affecting
the rights of the assembly or any of the members, any member may "rise to a question of privilege,"
and state the matter, which the chairman decides to be, or not to be, a matter of privilege:
(from the chairman's decision of course an appeal can be taken).  If the question is one of
privilege, it supersedes,

=== Page 147 ===========================================================

for the time being, the business before the assembly; its consideration can be postponed to
another time, or the previous question can be ordered on it so as to stop debate, or it can
be laid on the table, or referred to a committee to examine and report upon it.  As soon as
the question of privilege is in some way disposed of, the debate which was interrupted is resumed.

63. To Close the Meeting.  (a) Fix the time to which to adjourn.  If it is desired to have
an adjourned meeting of the assembly, it is best some time before its close to move, "That
when this assembly adjourns, it adjourns to meet at such a time," specifying the time.  This
motion can be amended by altering the time, but if made when another question is before the
assembly, neither the motion nor the amendment can be debated.  If made when no other business
is before the assembly, it stands as any other main question, and can be debated. "The starving because at least not yet," joked the Registrar
with wanton eyes.

Art. XIII.  Debate.

65. Rules of Speaking in Debate.  All remarks must be addressed to the chairman, and must be
confined to the question before the assembly, avoiding all personalities and reflections upon
any one's motives.  It is usual for permanent assemblies to adopt rules limiting the number
of times any member can speak to the same question, and the time allowed for each speech;*
[In Congress the House of Representatives allows from each member only one speech of one hour's
length; the Senate allows two speeches without limit as to length.] as otherwise one member,
while he could speak only once to the same question, might defeat a measure by prolonging his
speech and declining to yield the floor except for a motion to adjourn.  In ordinary assemblies
two speeches should be allowed each member (except upon an appeal), and these rules also limit
the time for each speech to ten minutes.  A majority can permit a member to speak oftener or
longer whenever it is desired, and the motion granting such permission cannot be debated.

=== Page 151 ===========================================================

However, if greater freedom is wanted, it is only necessary to consider the question informally,
or if the assembly is large, go into committee of the whole.* [See Rules of Order, §§ 32, 33.]
If on the other hand it is desired to limit the debate more, or close it altogether, it can
be done by a two-thirds vote, as shown in § 58 (b).

66. Undebatable Questions and those Opening the Main Question to Debate.  [A full list of these
will be found in § 35, to which the reader is referred.  Whenever a motion has been made and
seconded, it is the duty of the chairman, if the motion is in order, to state the question
so that the assembly may know what question is before them.  The seconding of a motion is required
to prevent a question being introduced when only one member is in favor of it, and consequently

=== Page 152 ===========================================================

but little attention is paid to it in mere routine motions, or when it is evident that many
are in favor of the motion; in such cases the chairman assumes that the motion is seconded.

Often in routine work the chairman puts the question without waiting for even a motion, as
few persons like to make such formal motions, and much time would be wasted by waiting for
them: (but the chairman can only do this as long as no one objects.)  The following motions,
however, do not have to be seconded:  (a) a call for the orders of the day; (b) a call to order,
or the raising of any question of order; and (c) an objection to the consideration of a question.

One of the commonest forms of stating a question is to say that, "It is moved and seconded
that," and then give the motion.  When an amendment has been voted on, the chairman announces
the result, and then says, "The question now recurs on the resolution," or, "on the resolution
as amended," as the case may be.  So in all cases, as soon as a vote is taken, he should immediately
state the question then before the assembly, if there be any.  If the motion is debatable or
can be amended, the chairman, usually after stating the question, and

=== Page 153 ===========================================================

always before finally putting it, inquires, "Are you ready for the question?"  Some of the
common forms of stating and putting questions are shown in §§ 46-48.  The forms of putting
the following questions, are, however, peculiar:

If a motion is made to Strike out certain words, the question is put in this form:  "Shall
these words stand as a part of the resolution?" so that on a tie vote they are struck out.

If the Previous Question is demanded, it is put thus:  "Shall the main question be now put?"

If an Appeal is made from the decision of the Chair, the question is put thus:  "Shall the
decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the assembly?"  [convention, society, etc.]
If the Orders of the Day are called for, the question is put thus:  "Will the assembly now
proceed to the Orders of the Day?" 

"Truth," was heard the voice of Moncada.

"Even the hero, Morone, the habet their chosen you, devoid of life."

But this quiet last words were shouted at Pescara. Morone had his head quickly turned and saw
the knight his attack as he saw the Spaniard revealed, fell he in a rage, his features distorted,
and he raged like a madman. "False and cruel! Wrong and cruel! Oh, I beaten with blindness! "Then overwhelmed
by mindless vengeance, he shouted against Moncada: "Know it, knight,
this" - he pointed to the commander - "is the culprit!

Because of him the whole conspiracy! I am his creature, and now I sacrifice the monster! "

Now the Duke jumped in, with the Del Guasto standing behind the passionate Pescara Occurs enjoyed.
"Saute, Paillasse mon ami, pour tout le monde saute!" he taunted Morone. "Yes, if we had not
listened to, we two BWA, behind the red curtain and the golden Tassel there! I must tell the time,
treasure, it's hilarious. Did not hear you, I auspfiff you? "Then, suddenly becoming serious,
he turned down the view of Moncada, put his hand on his chest, emphasizing
that: "In my royal blood, has the commander at that hour is not yesterday's
hair fluctuated widely in his honor and loyalty!

"

Morone was destroyed.

Del Guasto laid hands on him and pulled him away. "Lord Chancellor" he scoffed, "you bedanket will save
you the torture our listening." The Duke was, a pleading gesture Pescara obedience.

"Your excellency," began Moncada, "here I am convinced. This Ye always just your game driven
perhaps condescending, as is seemly for Spanish pride. With such a man conspired no Pescara. But,
your excellency, in his impotent rage, this mendacious Spoken truth when he accused you, the
author of Italian conspiracy be. Not the author, but the beneficiaries. Do not discouraging habet,

It was easy to say a decisive word, and to halt their support with an indignant and highly visible
gesture. This did not you habet.

It defers as a dark and interpretable form. "

"Knight", Pescara interrupted him, "Do not I have to give account of my tuna and leave, but
only my Emperor. "

"Your king," said Moncada.

"To call it, you commanded the respect, because a King of Spain is more than the emperor. And the
grandson of Ferdinand is a King of Spain be. Karl develops slowly, and under different competing
influences, but his Spanish blood is growing in strength and his German soak up the last drop.
He loathed the heresy, and his piety will make him a Spaniard. "He said this with a quiet smile
and enthusiastic eyes shine.

"Avalos," he continued, "your fathers who fought for the faith against the Muslim nations, sailed
up your ancestor with that of Alfonso in Naples. Return to your origins! The noble blood flows in your veins.
As you can see that the great loves procrastinating between the Spanish
world of thought and the wretched Italian machinations?

Ours is the Earth, as she obeyed once the Romans. See the wonderful ways of God: Castile and
Aragon married, Burgundy and Flanders acquired the empire gained
a discovered and conquered new world, and all that dominant, people
with a steeled, a blessed, twofold in blood baptized heathen sword!
What gave you that misery, Spain gives you a thousand times: Treasures,
country, fame, and - heaven!

Because we are fighting for the heavens
and the Catholic belief that a church rule on earth. Otherwise, God
became man would be in vain. Quorum.  [See § 43 for full information on this subject.]

72. Order of Business.  Every society should adopt an order of business adapted to its special
wants.  The following is the usual order where no special rule is adopted, and when more than
one regular meeting is held each year:

=== Page 157 ===========================================================

(1) Reading of the minutes of the last meeting. (5) New Business.

Business cannot be considered out of its order, except by a two-thirds vote; but a majority
can lay on the table the different questions as they come up, and thus reach a subject they
wish first to consider.  If a subject has been made a Special Order for this meeting, then
it is to be considered immediately after the minutes are read.

73. Amendments of Constitutions, By-Laws and Rules of Order, should be permitted only when
adopted by a two-thirds vote, at a regular meeting of the society, after having been proposed
at the previous regular meeting.  If the meetings are very frequent, weekly, for instance,
amendments should be adopted only at the quarterly meetings, after having been proposed at
the previous quarterly meeting.

=== Page 158 ===========================================================

Legal Rights of Assemblies and the Trial of their Members.

The Right of Deliberative Assemblies to Punish their Members.  A deliberative assembly has
the inherent right to make and enforce its own laws and punish an offender--the extreme penalty,
however, being expulsion from its own body.  When expelled, if the assembly is a permanent
society, it has a right, for its own protection, to give public notice that the person has
ceased to be a member of that society.

But it has no right to go beyond what is necessary for self protection and publish the charges
against the member.  In a case where a member of a society was expelled, and an officer of
the society published, by their order, a statement of the grave charges upon which he had been
found guilty, the expelled member recovered damages from the officer, in a suit for libel--the
court holding that the truth of the charges did not affect the case.

=== Page 159 ===========================================================

The Right of an Assembly to Eject any one from its place of meeting. Every deliberative assembly
has the right to decide who may be present during its session, and when the assembly, either
by a rule or by a vote, decides that a certain person shall not remain in the room, it is the
duty of the chairman to enforce the rule or order, using whatever force is necessary to eject
the party.

The chairman can detail members to remove the person, without calling upon the police.  If,
however, in enforcing the order, any one uses harsher treatment than is necessary to remove
the person, the courts have held that he, and he alone is liable to prosecution, just the same
as a policeman would be under similar circumstances.  However badly the man may be abused while
being removed from the room, neither the chairman nor the society are liable for damages, as,
in ordering his removal, they did not exceed their legal rights.

Rights of Ecclesiastical Tribunals.  Many of our deliberative assemblies are ecclesiastical
bodies, and it is important to know how much respect will be paid to their decisions by the
civil courts.

A church became divided and each party

=== Page 160 ===========================================================

claimed to be the church, and therefore entitled to the church property. The case was taken
into the civil courts, and finally, on appeal, to the U. S. Supreme Court, which held the case
under advisement for one year, and then reversed the decision of the State Court, because it
conflicted with the decision of the highest ecclesiastical court that had acted upon the case.
The Supreme Court, in rendering its decision, laid down the broad principle that, when a local
church is but a part of a larger and more general organization or denomination, it will accept
the decision of the highest ecclesiastical tribunal to which the case has been carried within
that general church organization, as final, and will not inquire into the justice or injustice
of its decree as between the parties before it.  The officers, the ministers, the members,
or the church body which the highest judiciary of the denomination recognizes, the court will
recognize.  Whom that body expels or cuts off, the court will hold to be no longer members
of that church.

Trial of Members of Societies.  Every deliberative assembly, having the right to purify its
own body, must therefore have the right to investigate the character of its members.

=== Page 161 ===========================================================

It can require any of them to testify in the case, under pain of expulsion if they refuse.
In § 36 is shown the method of procedure when a member is charged with violating the rules
of decorum in debate.  If the disorderly words are of a personal nature, before the assembly
proceeds to deliberate upon the case, both parties to the personality should retire.  It is
not necessary for the member objecting to the words to retire, unless he is personally involved
in the case.

When the charge is against the member's character, it is usually referred to a committee of
investigation or discipline, or to some standing committee to report upon.  Some societies
have standing committees, whose duty it is to report cases for discipline whenever any are
known to them.

In either case the committee investigate the matter and report to the society.  This report
need not go into details, but should contain their recommendations as to what action the society
should take, and should usually close with resolutions covering the case, so that there is
no need for any one to offer any additional resolutions upon it.  The ordinary resolutions,
where the member is recommended to be expelled,

=== Page 162 ===========================================================

are (1) to fix the time to which the society shall adjourn; and (2) to instruct the clerk to
cite the member to appear before the society at this adjourned meeting to show cause why he
should not be expelled, upon the following charges, which should then be given.

After charges are preferred against a member and the assembly has ordered that he be cited
to appear for trial, he is theoretically under arrest, and is deprived of all the rights of
membership until his case is disposed of.

The clerk should send the accused a written notice to appear before the society at the time
appointed, and should at the same time furnish him with a copy of the charges.  A failure to
obey the summons is generally cause enough for summary expulsion.

At the appointed meeting, what may be called the trial, takes place. Frequently the only evidence
required against the member is the report of the committee. 

He pulled a sheet from his pocket and held it to her face Filippo. But he stared at it, as he
understood nothing at all, and fell back into his schlafaehnliche anesthesia back.

"Examined the wounds, Mr. Dottore", then turned the inspector to the doctor. "If the It allows
any state, we have to create this gentleman down immediately. I saw horses outside. We do two
legal actions at a time when we seize it, because they are loaded with slow-products. It is good that you
know what people this Treppi visited, if you even want to know. "

While he said this, and the physician Filippo approached Fenice had disappeared from the chamber. The
old Chiaruccia sat quietly and muttered to himself. They heard voices outside and a strange restlessness
of coming and going, and the hole in the wall did come faces, which quickly disappeared .-- "It is
possible," now said the surgeon, "to have him Down to create when he is firmly and double.
Faster it would of course again , Let him pay here in the peace, and in the care of these old
witch, whose Wundkraeuter the best trained doctor wreck. It may be the way it wound fever to life occurred,
and a responsibility I undertake no, Signor Commissario. "

"Unnecessary, unnecessary," replied the other. "How it is going, can not be considered . Come
Sets him on Euern Association as hard as you are able to not be missed, and then forward. We
have the moonlight and take it with a guy. Come out, however, Molza, and assures you of the
horses. "

One of the sbirri *, the command that was opened quickly and the Kammertuer meant, as an unexpected
sight of him petrified. The room was next door to a host of Villagers occupied, stood on the top
two Contrabbandieri. Fenice had with them spoken when the door opened. Now they came to the
threshold of the chamber and said with great emphasis:

{Ed * Minion,
bunny}

"You leave this chamber immediately, Signori, and without
the wounded, or you see Pistoia again.

In this house yet no blood flowed, while Fenice Cattaneo his mistress,
and the Madonna prevent such atrocities in all future time.

Does not attempt to come back with some more. You have the body nor in mind, where one by
one the rock stairs hinaufklimmt between the walls. A child can defend the pass when the stones
rolled down the slope, which are up there as sown. We will then put a guard up this gentleman in
security. Now you go and boast of the feat, that its a girl have betrayed and killed a wounded man
wanted. "

The faces of the sbirri discolored more and more and there was a pause after the last words. Then
all three went so far as to command hidden pistols from his pocket,
and the inspector said coldly.

"We come in the name of the law if you own it not respected, you would also prevent other, to
draw it fully? It can be six men from cost you your life if it forces us to procure the law with
respect violence. "

A murmur ran through the crowd of others. "Still, friends!" cried
the resolute girl.

"They dare not. You know that everyone they shoot, the murderer a six-fold Death brings. You talk
like a fool, "she turned back to the commissioners." The fear that sits upon your foreheads talks,
at least wiser. Do what you anraet it. The path is open, Signori!

She stepped back and pointed with his left hand after the door of
the house.

The whispers in the chamber a few words together, then they proceeded with tolerable attitude by
the excited throng, them louder and louder with curses were on their way. The surgeon was undecided
whether he should follow, but closed on an imperious sign of the girl he hurriedly to his
companions.

This whole scene had raised the patient in the chamber half mitangesehn with big eyes. Now the old
woman came back to him and moved him the pillow. "Still are, my son!" said them. "There is no danger.
Sleep, sleep, wake up poor son! Chiaruccia the old, and that you are safe, ensures our Fenice,
Blessed be the child! Sleep sleep! "

Notes To The Table.

(1) This column only applies to assemblies that have adopted these Rules.  If no rules are
adopted, a majority vote is sufficient for the adoption of any motion, except to "suspend the
rules," which requires a unanimous vote.  [See Two-thirds Vote, below.]

(2) Undebatable if made when another question is before the assembly.

(3) An affirmative vote on this motion cannot be reconsidered.

(4) Allows of but limited debate upon the propriety of the postponement.

(5) Can be moved and entered on the record when another has the floor, but cannot interrupt
the business then before the assembly;  it must be made on the day the original vote was taken,
and by one who voted with the prevailing side.  When debatable, only one speech from each member
is permitted.

(7) The objection can only be made when the question is first introduced, before debate.

MISCELLANEOUS RULES.

Two-thirds Vote.  The Table conforms to the Rules of Order, which are based upon this principle.
If an assembly has adopted no Rules of Order, then a majority vote is sufficient for the adoption
of any motion, except to "suspend the rules," which would require a unanimous vote.

Forms of Putting Certain Questions.

Various Forms of Amendments.

An Amendment may be either (1) by "adding" or (2) by "striking out" words or paragraphs; or
(3) by "striking out certain words and inserting others;" or (4) by "substituting" a different
motion on the same subject; or (5) by "dividing the question" into two or more questions, so
as to get a separate vote on any particular point or points. If in his mind, such a Wall rose against
us, especially in moments when we believe met his soul to have? But away with the ghost, which
is nothing but the humidity before the storm, the natural Fear and uncertainty that precedes any
big and dangerous business. "

A bolt of lightning flashed over the Vatican. He was in white fire and showed the beautiful proportions
the new architecture. In the rolling of thunder, the two BWA lost between the columns a portico, Guicciardin
affected and wondering what it meant Omen, heedless of the Registrar
to the sky and his character, because he saw himself at the feet of
the Colonna.

This was in a frenzy of enthusiasm to the Vatican on the next steps of his many and leave through
one of its side doors. Litter and entourage, which hands it to the main gate vainly expected,
they had forgotten, and walked, more ambitious of her dream chased worn as the gathering storm,
moving with robes to her palace place back on the Apostle. She walked with a stolen crown as
the first Tullia not over the body of the Father, but by the assassinated loyalty to the state,
for the daughter of Fabricius Colonna and Pescara's wife was a Neapolitan
and Unterthanin Charles the Fifth, king of Naples.

The crowning gesture of the Pope, they had overwhelmed. Habit and environment, the belief the
centuries and the traditional forms of piety, they were at the head of the Church, so this might
be degenerate, is still a workshop of the divine will and a vessel of the highest counsels
see - and how could one's own self-esteem and more yet the pride in the value of her husband
doubt they can at the papal rights, to put the worthy head a crown?

So you were the arrogant act of the Medici appear despite the changing times as a statement
of the deity.

The new queen without a retinue had hurried through the Borgo, crossed the bridge and Engel
was now been conducting the "straight street" as it was called, in the tumult of the crowd. This
gave the Colonna respectfully room to surprise without the unaccompanied
passage and the hurrying feet the illustrious lady who is now a storm
of previous storm inspired.

Gradually but after their slow steps in the dense throng not to the general Street, although
the narrow sky was getting darker and more threatening about.

Then she saw the amount of time a cavalcade. Lords of the Spanish embassy accompanied, no doubt
to an audience at the Vatican, the third imperial commander in Lombardy,
Leyva. This ex-groom, the son of an innkeeper and a girl that a slavish
Ambition and an iron will brought up, had a plump body and the face
of a Bull-dog, because of the forehead, nose and lip were split him
the same sword blows.

  Shall the question be considered? 

"How I envy the generals!" dreamed Don Juan. "What excitement, what pleasure! Italia throws herself
into his arms ... He will caress subjugate them, and throw away ... oh, he is with it like a
cat playing with the mouse, "and he made a hash with the right gesture.

A flaming anger overpower the Colonna. "Outcast," she cried, "I have asked you Pescara would like to do? Are
you the person knowing it? I welcome you, herumzudeuten him? ...
Like a cat with a mouse ... disgusting!

So you've played with Julien, dishonorable! "

This Julia was from a noble novarese race, and was the granddaughter of the learned Doctor blade
Numa Dati, who had healed the spear wound Pescara. Del Guasto, in the Taken the doctor home
district, had misled the girl and changed the flat. The price given was then destroyed by shame,
the innocent face of her grandfather far away from Novara in a Roman
convent, and had fled to the powerful Colonna Knees begging to have
mercy on her and make her honor.

Since it was a dishonorable Victoria, bit his lip, the Don Juan. "Calm down, lady," he said,
"Balance table your words. I'm not dishonorable, but I would be if I did not leave Julien
would have.

I'm not talking about the differences in the blood of a Avalos and Dati, but just assume that
I do not like each man killed, but an innocent to the bride proper. "

Victoria's human heart revolted. "It is you, the poor thing with your caresses and assurances,
and perhaps even be related to false vows and oaths to the event! Are you do not? Can you deny
it? "

He replied: "I do not deny it, but it was my martial law, for war
is between the Will male and female innocence.

I tried, yes. Why do they resisted not? Why were they in? Why are you accusing me that she
was weak and that I now despise and scorn? "

Victoria froze in horror.
"Wicked person!" she moaned.

"Madonna", abbreviated the conversation
the young man, "that's an awkward conversation, and your I'm tired
of it. I suggest you before a tribunal.

"The Prophet and Sibyl? This I did, years ago, and carefully considered, but they are blurry
to me again, except for a few details. For example, the person with his hair, which recoils from
a mirror - "

"What he sees the threats of today," she added excitedly.
"And then the Caryatid, squeezed by an enormous load, the short,
square, miserable creature! The ugliest woman without question, as
you are the best - " But today, after the sun had hot days, a fine mist heraufgewaelzt from
the gorges and spread slowly over the finely shaped naked Felszuege of the highlands. It was
about nine in the evening clock. In the scattered low Steinhuetten, the day just about the oldest
women and youngest children are guarded, only weak firelight glowed. To the flock, over which staggered
the large boilers, were the shepherds and their families, and slept, and the dogs had stretched
into the ashes; a sleepless Grandmother probably still sitting on a pile of skins, and moved mechanically
Spindle back and forth, muttering prayers, or a restless sleeping child in the basket swinging.
